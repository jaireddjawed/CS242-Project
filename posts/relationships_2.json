        "text": "Please help me (20F)\n\nMe and my boyfriend (22F) of 5 years just got into a huge fight. He got in my face about not doing the dishes after I cooked and I was trying to push him away. He kept slapping me so I retaliated. I scratched him to try and move away. He grabbed me and shook me like a rag doll, making my ear piercings bleed. He told me to get out. I had nowhere to go so I didn’t. We were arguing, he went to grab a dirty rag from the dishes, soaked it and scrubbed me all over as I just had a fake tan done. He wanted to cut off my freshly dyed hair. He started messaging my dad telling him to get me to leave him alone. I started to pack my stuff up and leave but I kept asking him to calm down to talk. He got in my face again. I slapped him. I shouldn’t have. He reacted again and spat on me numerous times. Slapped me, spanked me, grabbed me so hard my arms are numb. Then, he got my childhood teddy I cannot sleep without and ripped it’s head clean off. I screamed, he was so angry at me that I screamed ‘trying to get the police called’ over a teddy bear. I left after that. He texted me saying he doesn’t want anything to do with me anymore and he breaks up with me. \n\nI’m so confused. It was his birthday yesterday. We had a great day..\n\nTL;DR: my boyfriend kicked me out and I have nowhere to go. I feel lost and I don’t know what to do. Any advice or help?",

        "text": "I will preface this by saying the following: \n\nI was diagnosed with stress and depression due to work related issues in January (think 70 hours a week, stressful job role and work life in general. Currently on medication for depression, which is helping). I am also on the bipolar spectrum, and receiving help.\n\nSo, up until the 3 year mark, back in November everything seemed to be going fine, we'd never argued, and I mean ever, everything seemed perfect. She lost 2 people very close to her (one of which was her boss, from cancer, the other her grandfather who passed after a fall at home).\n\nI've never really had a high sex drive, and this hasn't been as much of an issue. We'd be intimate 2-3 times a week, but it didn't seem bad. I should add, before we got together I'd been single for over 10 years, and she'd been single for at least 4 or 5. Our views on life matched, interests etc\n\nJanuary rolls around, and I'm signed work for 3 weeks with the above mentioned stress and depression from work. She had mentioned that she wasn't as happy as she normally was. I tried to rectify this whilst also working through my own issues. \n\nThroughout our relationship, I've always earnt more money, and had no issues paying for anything she needed (fuel, cigarettes, anything), and still happy to do so.\n\nHowever. The last month or so, possibly longer,  things haven't been the same at all. Not bad, just different. I know she's been helping one of her male friends with depression, no issue with me, I'm not the jealous type. She's been going on walks with him and just generally being there for him. \n\nWe went away for a weekend break last week. Throughout the break, she was distant, barely showed me any affection, there was no intimacy at all. We got home Monday, and she sent me message (I was outside smoking a cigarette, she was upstairs in our bedroom), basically saying she wants a break, and that she feels the relationship has fizzled out, amongst other things (I'm happy to add the message here for added clarification).\n\nThe last few days I've been sleeping I  the spare room, which is fine. There has been zero communication between us at all, either face to face or via message, and we message all the time, everyday. Alarm bells have been ringing and I suspect she may be seeing someone else. \n\nWhat do I do? I feel like a stranger in my own home. Are we over? Her family are furious with for treating me this way, and believe I'm the best thing that's happened to her in a long time. \n\nTL:DR: Relationship of 4 years on break, unsure of what to do and need advice.",

        "text": "I’m looking for advice on how to get over my ex, even though he has really hurt me. It’s been rough since September 2022. We dated for 2.5 years prior. I told him I needed some space (breakup) to focus on getting into my dream masters program with less than a 5% acceptance rate (I needed 5 A+). He agreed and was waiting for me. I fucked up by never giving him an end date. But he never expressed to me he was tired of waiting and communicated his feelings. I just knew he was a little confused on why we couldn’t be together but for my mental health, I couldn’t worry about another person right now. Keep in mind every weekend we told each other we still loved each other and can’t wait to marry each other. \n\nIn Jan 2023, he flirted with my best friend at a party and over text and she sent me the screenshots. I understand we’re both “single” but it was not cool of him to go for my friend. He apologized profusely and told me he still loves me and I said I would try and forgive him. 2 weeks later we got into an argument and he lashed out at me. He told me he doesn’t feel anything, cannot love anyone, doesn’t love me, doesn’t care about me, wouldn’t care if I died etc. That hurt my feelings a lot. I poured my heart out and wrote him a long apology on text and he told me he still wanted to be with me. Obviously this left me confused, so I called him 2 weeks after that begging for him back and he called me back the next day saying his answer is no. I found out he’s talking to someone else now 3 weeks after we last spoke. All of the things he’s doing and have said have really hurt me and I’m trying my hardest to move forward but I’m going through a major depressive episode. How do I get over this?\n\ntldr: my ex hurt me really badly and I can’t get over him",

        "text": "So I took my boyfriend of two years to family supper at my dads house. It was just as family dinners go, a lot of talking and sitting and not super exciting for anyone. After supper was over, I was just about to head out and bring my boyfriend home. We’re standing next to each other and I notice he’s typing super quickly large paragraph and I unfortunately did look over and notice my own name. So curiosity got the better of me and I read what he was saying about me. It was a message to his brother that read, “I HATE having supper with _____’s family. Every single fucking time I just sit here for hours staring at the floor. I can’t fucking stand it.” When I saw this I immediately felt awful for looking at his phone, and awful I put him in a situation that made him feel this way. After I brought him back to his place I asked him if he had an okay time and he just told me yes it was nice. I admitted to what I saw on his phone and he told me that I was invading his privacy and that message was not meant for me to see, which I completely understood. However, he never told me how he felt, only told his siblings. \n\nWe’ve had arguments before about family gatherings, he would be on his phone for a lot of them, or make small remarks that he wanted to leave, and once saying “if I was home I’d be eating by now”. This makes me feel really bad, but also doesn’t make me want to invite him to any more gatherings. And since this incident, I haven’t. I know I invaded his privacy, but I can’t help but think, if he doesn’t want to be around my family so much, then why does he agree to come? Or why are we dating if he can’t stand to just sit and smile instead of be silent and stare at the ground. \n\nTL;DR took my boyfriend of 2 years to a family dinner. Looked over at his phone and saw that he was telling his brother how much he hated having family dinner with my family. He never addressed it. He complains every single time even though I’ve tried to make it as painless as possible and even stress that there’s no hard feelings if he doesn’t come.",

        "text": "My (28F) friend (28M) of 5 years likes to go on really long monologues that often span multiple topics. They're not conversations, they're just one-sided monologues that last for like ten minutes at a time.\n\nIf I try to jump in to say something, they get upset and say I'm interrupting and not letting them finish, even if they've already been talking for minutes already and have gone through 2-3 topics. They say I won't be able to comment 'properly' because I 'haven't let them finish' or 'haven't let them get to the point'.\n\nI've tried to explain it's hard to stay engaged when they just go on and on in a string of topics in great detail, and that it's hard to have a conversation that way, and they insist that it's not even supposed to be a conversation but an \"essay\", and that I'm just supposed to respond when they're done and have made their grand overarching point, and only then will I understand enough to have a worthy response at all.\n\nI don't sit there making notes to respond to once they've finished jumping between talking about four different topics in great detail. And many of these topics are like political history or related to controversial topics they read in the news which they already know I'm not totally interested in; I know they're not interested in some of my hobbies and don't push it on them.\n\nBut they get so. mad. if I try to participate before they've \"finished\" or remark that I can't just stand around listening to an \"essay\" about three random topics they're trying to string together. He says that I miss the point and can't comment, but the topics are literally so random and if it's been like 10 minutes and he still hasn't gotten to the point, I just don't care.\n\nI don't know what to do. I don't know how to talk to them about it because they just get mad at me for trying to interject or for saying I can't just sit and listen to the 10 minute monologue without making a peep. If I don't do that, they say they hate talking to me. Is there any way to talk about this?  \n\n\nTLDR; Friend almost daily talks for a long time about random things in great detail and just wants me to sit there and shut up while he goes on and on, I can only talk when he's done. He's mad at me because I told him that's hard to pay attention for that long or that it's annoying to not be able to participate. How do I salvage it?",

        "text": "A few months ago during my uni holidays I (20M) got messaged fully out of the blue by this girl (let’s call her 20F) I knew from school who I hadn’t talked to since we were last in school 2 years before. \n\nShe just asked how I’ve been and if I wanted to go for coffee sometime and I was like sure, not thinking anything of it since I had quite a few classes with her back in school so we definitely weren’t strangers to each other or anything.\n\nWe catch up over coffee and again I’m thinking completely nothing of it and as we leave she’s like “hopefully see you soon!”. Even then though, I figured she’s just being friendly and wanted to stay in touch a bit more often than every 2 years lmao.\n\nFast forward to a couple of weeks later, I’m out for lunch with one of my long time close family friends who also happens to be 20F’s best friend. At some point in the conversation she randomly mentions “oh, by the way 20F is free to hang out this weekend” and doesn’t say anything else about it for the rest of the lunch.\n\nSo I figure I’ll message 20F cos she’s good company and we go out again (should specify all these in the story are lunches, no dinners or whatever) and at the end she asks if I’m free next weekend. At this point I’m kinda wondering if she’s interested in dating but she could easily just wanna be friends too.\n\nWe go out the next weekend but then we’re both busy for a while and don’t meet again for almost a month with only kinda occasional messaging.\n\nBut then in this between period, my mum and close family friends mum go out for lunch which is pretty standard for them. What isn’t standard is that family friends mum talks to MY MUM about ‘me and 20F’. As you can imagine, I’m pretty confused why my friends mum would know since I’ve barely even mentioned it to my mum cos I didn’t think it was anything important lol. This is when I start questioning whether she’s interested or not since why would our mutual close friend’s mum know we’ve been hanging out if it was just as friends.\n\nSo fast forward to the next time me and 20F meet and it goes more or less the same as the previous couple of times. As we’re leaving we both agree we should hang out more regularly during uni but nothing in our interaction that would suggest anything more than good friends.\n\nSince then we’ve met up when we’ve been free and it’s basically the same pattern with only occasional messaging etc though I guess we know each other a bit better now so convos flow some more\n\nBasically, am I missing some obvious hints? From my POV I’d say I’m interested in her romantically but I’m also happy with being friends and so I don’t really wanna ruin that and make things awkward if she doesn’t feel the same way.\n\nTLDR:\n\nGirl I knew from school messages out of nowhere asking to catch up and I thought nothing of it, kinda mixed signals from there due to things I heard from mutual friend. Unsure whether or not she’s interested romantically or simply wants to be friends.",

With that I have a girlfriend who doesn't play any instrument. This isn't a problem for me, it never was a problem or a downside to dating her. Yesterday after school my friends and I were on the bus talking about music and such, which turned into 2 of my friends (excluding me) having a conversation about that one of them wouldn't want to date someone who wasn't into music and playing instruments. I chimed in and said \"I think it's definitely a bonus if a girl is into music like that but it isn't a deal breaker, making music with my girlfriend sounds like a dream though\" now when saying that I'm in my girlfriends arms and I didn't think anything of it or she would he offended at all. She didn't act offended until when we were on discord that night in a private call she said \"I think I want to learn how to play piano because I want to make your dreams come true\" I said that was great but what did she mean about making my dreams come true. She said on the bus I said it's attractive when a girl plays a instrument and how it's a dream to make music with your girlfriend and I don't want you to leave me for someone who can do all of that\" In that moment I didnt know what to say, I ended up saying I would never leave her for a reason like that and I like her for her and she shouldn't want to change for me or anyone else. She told me she was gonna go. Today in school she didn't say much about anything to me and she has been slow to replying to text and such. I honestly don't know what to do, I feel like I really messed up and I just don't know where to start to fix it\n\n\nTd;lr I said Its my dream to make music with girlfriend one day and now my girlfriend who doesn't know anything about music feels like I'm not in our relationship for the long haul.",

        "text": "My bf and I have been together for 3 years now and we have a 1 year old together. This issue started in year 2 of our relationship and when I was pregnant. I would still keep in touch with guys I've previously been with and post updates about my life on social media, like cute pics and eat up all the attention I get from them, which one of the guys I've had a situationship with when I was younger(we went to the same junior high) turned into emotional cheating because he seems to know how to make me feel better whenever I vent about my bf, and makes me feel special. We had met up in person too because I wanted a break from household chores, and he was being really sweet throughout the night, but he did keep holding / touching me subtly in sensitive areas. I didn't really know how to react. But I won't lie it felt nice. I don't want to shit on my bf but I've been feeling neglected and more arguments happen that exhaust me ever since we had our baby, and he does really try to grow our relationship but I keep seeking external validation from other men. Including online. \n\nHow can I stop seeking online validation? \n\nTL;DR emotionally cheating on my bf and seeking online validation, but I want to stop. Looking for advice.",

Now, this would be my third serious relationship and everything feels great except when it doesn’t. He’s honest and very good guy. Listens to me and wants to be there for me. Yet, I just don’t feel like he’s the one. I mean, I felt like that on our first few dates but it kind of faded. I want to be with someone who’s a lot more into me. In short even though he assures me that he’s not into anyone else, and would never cheat, I feel he can put in a little more effort. He agrees with me when I bring it up and has mended his ways a lot. But I still don’t feel secure. I keep looking for issues. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. If it’s just trauma from my previous relationship. I just don’t want to be with someone if I don’t feel safe. But I also don’t want to hurt him or break up with him without a proper reason because I’m afraid it’s just my head playing games with me. I do like him and care for him a lot. Just not sure if he’s someone I want to share my life with. \n\nTL;DR I want to break up with my boyfriend even though I don’t have a real reason but not sure if I should stay in it a little long to find out.",

I asked him who it was and what it was about and he just said its fine, its nothing, he just said not to worry about it and we'll talk about it later, so we started watching another episode of You, but like an hour later, he was laying with his head on my thighs and he started sobbing crying, and i tried to support him and everything i told him its all okay, he said that hes sorry and he just left to go to the gym but didn't come home until a day later so i think he just slept at his brothers place.\n\nI know i seem evil for this but i just dont feel the same attraction to him after he cried and i really really want to fix this, i love my boyfriend and everything and i feel like an idiot for feeling like this. I dont know why it's happening, like in the 3 years of us being together, i've always had this crazy sexual attraction to him, like super submissive ''yes sir'' attitude, but he's tried initiating sex and i just dont feel in the mood to be close to him like that anymore?\n\nTL;DR: Boyfriend cried in front of me and i no longer feel attracted to him.",

And his ignorance makes everyone annoyed and moody and then when you get mad at him and call him out he gets defensive and plays the victim card.\n\nExample : my mom has been dealing all day with my grandma because she’s having a lot of symptoms plus she’s working from home and my grandma is exhausting,my grandma doesn’t listen and acts like a 6 year old (character wise) sometimes. My mom is stressed and exhausted and my stepdad has been saying “when’s the food going to be ready?” “Where’s my plate?” “Why are you so moody? 🙄” \n\nThen my mom goes “I’m exhausted and I just want to rest” and he goes “well I’m exhausted as well,i work hard out there and I want to rest as well yet you don’t see me throwing a tantrum”, keep in mind that he got home at 12pm from work and it’s 7pm and all he’s been doing is watching tv on the couch. My mom tells him “why does everything have to be a competition with you,I’m exhausted let me be exhausted” and walks away and now he’s annoyed because my mom is angry. \n\nI looked at my fiancé and rolled my eyes and told him “I can’t wait to go back home,although I’m always grateful they showed me what I didn’t want in a relationship and that I actively looked for the opposite of what they are”.\n\nTL;DR! My fiancé and I are stuck at my parents home quarantining and my stepdad and his ignorance remind me that they taught me what type of relationship I don’t want.",

        "text": " My(18F) whole life I knew I wanted to be a performer, specifically an actress-mainly. Growing up, many people always compared me to being an actress or I've been told I have broadway-esk type of talent and soul. I can't see myself doing anything else really (besides writing maybe) I've always been very passionate about performing. My heart belongs to the arts truly. I want to go to college for it, I interned at a theatre program. I've done many shows in and out of school and I'm getting ready for a few performances coming soon. \n\n  My family knows and they are the same ones that have predicted me as an artist. However, they are not from the US or western society at all (Jamaicans) and as I'm approching college and really my career, I want to major performing arts. My mom(40s&amp;F) wants me to minor in something and I'm trying to find something to minor in. She says she refuses to spend her money on unrealistic stuff.\n\n  She knows saying that stuff hurts me because this is truly my passion. Everytime I try looking into careers I could do besides acting. It always go back to the entertainment industry. I know if I can't persue that career, I refuse to continue on living. I've accepted that for a very long time. I'm not afriadof death anymore, I've made attemps: The only thing stopping me is literally performing arts. Performing is the nly thing that makes me happy and is the only reason i continue living. I truly know I have a shot. Many of my teachers/mentor who also perform agree. Although they do also say I'm good at socalizing, team work, connecting, and writing and I could find another career with those skills.\n\n  Today my aunt(55F) called my mother's phone and she was on speaker through the car. I wanted to talk about my act that I'm working on for a spring show and somehow it became a lecture about my hair,(I wear wigs and weaves) following crowds(I simply want to cut my hair), to my career(acting/performing). It got to a point where my aunt said: \"What other careers are you interested in? What are some of your skills?\" To which my mother replid \"she has no skills\", mmy aunt literally had to tell her to shut up because of how rude that was. (And it really hurt my feelings). I endd up immedating that I would kill myself because I don't a life without my passion. My mom said \"well make sure you have my money to owe back before you do it\" My aunt her shocked by the comments and said that, that was not normal. \n\n  She said she only brought it up because someone in our family daughter(20s&amp;F) went to LA to become an actress and now she does porn an my aunt's husband's(55M) nefew(46M) went as well a long time ago and now barely gets booked. ( I don't even want to go to LA yet, I want to go to college in NY or Atlanta to study acting and do stage acting first) She said it's also dangerous as people can take advanage of me and I'm a black woman. However (sorta sad to admit) I know the industry is quite racist, I'm no longer a baby, I've delt with racism and I'm always going to. I ended up crying which caused my aunt to say sorry while my mom said she's not because she's being realistic and telling me the truth. Now she's sitting around mad at me and tying to take anger out on me in any way even though I'm trying to stay awayfrom her right now. \n\n  I don't know what to do nw. I'm super frustrated now. I also signed up for ccp for 12th grade so I can have a more higher learning on acting itself so I can improve. \n\ntldr; told my mom I would off myself if I can't make it to my passion/future career of performing arts after he told me to find a minor and Now she's mad",

        "text": "**TL;DR**: My boyfriend's parents looked up inappropriate searches on his phone (CP) in recent years that they are trying to threaten him with if he leaves the church/comes out because they think he's feminine, and he feels powerless to confront them \n\nHey guys. We met in youth group, but his parents were more strict than mine. I have a job, but his parents didn't let him work. I've been helping him apply for his first job, but his parents are refusing to give him work papers among others until he graduates. I've talked to my parents who don't believe that they would even after he graduates in a few months, but I'm writing this because his father is threatening him, and he struggled to open up to me until recently\n\nHis parents think he's feminine because he did ballet, and they've been questioning his gender identity too. He is straight, but they refuse to believe it. They took him out of ballet for those reasons when he was 13, but he's kept an interest in it and expressed wanting to go back to it too. However, he never expressed it to his parents. They found out through parental controls that track his search history and I think messages, and they still have them on to this day until he graduates (but I don't believe they'd remove them). They'll probably will keep it for as long as they're paying for his phone plan, and they never allowed him to work/kept papers to prevent him. He's also stretched/practiced at home to upkeep some of his skills over the years, and that led to arguments on top of the search results involving ballet too. However, they are threatening to ruin his career if he stops going to church/comes out upon graduation\n\nHis parents had a policy growing up that involved going through his phone whenever they wanted because they paid for it or else they'd cancel the phone plan, and sometimes they'd take it when he was sleeping too. He recently told me that he found a lot of searches on his phone that he never searched in recent years, and many are inappropriate searches such as \"nak\\*d teen gymnasts/poses\" that could identity as CP that one of his parents looked up. His father told him that he'd release the search history if he ever left the church or came out as gay/bi, and by release he means make a post about how he left the church and would be disowned for looking it up when he never did. My parents know I'm not religious despite being Christians and are supportive of our relationship, and they hate his parents too. I'm actually an atheist, but I haven't come out, and I don't plan to until I move out. My boyfriend's not a Christian too, but he obviously isn't gonna say that now. We want to move out together, but he's afraid to tell anyone about his parent's threat because he thinks it'll ruin his career/chances of getting a job, so I wanted to ask online for advice on what to do because he feels powerless to leave them with their threat in case someone doesn't believe him",

        "text": "So some backstory, we met when we both were juniors in college. I developed feelings for her after like a year and asked her out. She said she couldn’t be more than just friends with me for some reasons that I can’t say here, but they are pretty static and still haven’t changed. I really was heartbroken and needed some space from her and told her that. 3/4 months pass and i felt like I moved on, so I told her that I missed our friendship and wanted to see if we could pick back up, which she said yes to. We both eventually moved to different states but still talk every day, from “good morning” until “goodnight”. We both sleep super late so usually just stay up texting each other. \n\nFast forward to about a week ago, and we went on a trip together. We booked the 1 room with 1 bed which I admittedly didn’t think would be an issue, and neither did she. Both of us are pretty introverted so we stayed in a lot and just watched TV together in bed. On the day before we left, I wasn’t feeling well so I asked her if I could cuddle and she said yes so we cuddled while watching TV for a couple hours before going to bed. The day after, we say our goodbyes and leave separately. She seemed a bit bothered the day we left but I figured she was just tired because we slept super late.\n\nOverall, I thought the weekend was really fun and I loved spending time with her again as it it had been so long. We were laughing, joking, having a great time, and nothing seemed weird really until the morning we left, like I mentioned. When I got home however, I got a voicemail from her saying that she thinks we’re too close and that we can’t be friends and so she wants to go no contact “for a while”. I called her up and told her that I respect what she wants and that I’m always here whenever she thinks we can be friends again. \n\nIt’s been all of like 4 days, and I’m definitely not handling it well. She was my best friend and a huge part of my support system for dealing with stuff like this. Now I feel super alone, and I miss her more than I thought I could and every little thing reminds me of her. I feel like complete shit, and my chest physically hurts when I think of her. \n\nI’m now a mix of confused and sad and I don’t know how to deal; we went from literally talking every day throughout the day to not talking at all because we’re “too close”. I would’ve thought that we could just set limits for how much we talk if she thinks we’re too close because we already live in different states anyways. But she thinks we need to go full no contact, and I guess I don’t understand why. Am I missing something here? I want to give her the space she’s asking for but what if she doesn’t reach out? I wanted to wait like 3-4 weeks and then reach out to her to see if we could be friends again. Is that selfish of me to ask? I would appreciate any help! \n\n**TL;DR: Best friend and I took a trip together which went well I thought. We shared a bed and cuddled for a little and now she says we’re too close and says we need to go no contact for an unspecified time. What’s going on?**",

        "text": "\n\nHey there. I'm 29 year old guy who lives in the US. Met my ex (40F)  abroad, she's from the UK. My dad might have had sex with my girlfriend with a chance that she got pregnant. Of course I can't verify anything without a DNA test which is rough. Our relationship lasted 4 years.\n\nTldr: my ex might have had a 2 week-long fling with my dad. Not sure if the child is mine or my dads. Not sure how to move on from being cheated on. I want to heal and move on as a young dad.\n\n\nMet and started dating a british woman abroad. I came back to the states and was hospitalized for mental health issues, PTSD, mania. Later on my girlfriend (now ex) flew to the US to stay at my dads house while I was getting mental health treatment. She stayed at his place for 2 weeks, sleeping in the room next to his, and they were mostly home alone together. I was freaked out about this. Why? My dad is a serial cheater and before I was hospitalized he told me \"When your girlfriend comes to visit I'm going to fuck her because she's closer to my age.\" Charming. He's cheated on his wife and brags about it. \n\nMy ex picked me up from the hospital and we drove 10 hrs to go stay at my dads. We stayed somewhere and had unprotected sex because I'm an idiot and mania. She told me she wanted a kid.l, and I said I did too. On the way back to me dad's I asked her if she drank with him. She said \"We had a bottle of wine, I took a hit of THC from his pen.\" I asked what happened after and she said \"We just sat on the couch.\" I asked what happened next, and she brushed me off and wouldn't say. I specifically asked if they had sex and she said they didn't. I didn't believe her. The next few days of staying at my dads, she insisted on having me go work a random 2am shift at a warehouse (leaving her alone with my dad). So I did. On the commute she texted me a nude of her laying in bed, in the bedroom next to my dads. \n\nGuys this has been hell. I've been going to therapy for half a year and it helps but it's hard thinking she did that. I'm scared the child may not be mine. What if they didn't use protection? Idk.\n\nOne morning while we were staying at my dads, my ex said she was flying back to UK soon, and my dad sighed and looked all sad about it. He said \"Can't you stay longer?\" \n\nAlso after their potential fling I asked my dad again if they had sex. He said \"it never crossed my mind\" with a weird grin. He says \"go ahead and take a DNA test, I'll pay for it.\" He wants it shipped to and from him to have control. Everytime I ask my ex if she had sex with my dad, she blows up and freaks out. \n\nBtw we don't even need him for a DNA test. Just me, my ex, and my boy. \n\nAs far as suspecting my ex, I found a hidden drawer with a second phone with texts on there of her and another guy (they'd seen each other during our relationship). Found nude videos of other men on her phone. Everything is date stamped to be within the timeframe of our relationship. She says it was platonic, that she never cheated on me. \n\nSo here's what I think is going on. I am probably in the wrong and just paranoid/delusional, in need of further mental health help, I could see that. I'm in therapy still and have received some help with this infidelity/parental uncertainty thing. But at the same time the fear they had sex and that my child is not mine is so strong. It's probably ok, people cheat all the time and he might have had a vasectomy? I hope he had one. \n\nWhy can't she just tell me what happened between them? Then I could get closure but for real I don't think I'll ever get that. As for the child, I Skype my boy once a week and it sucks not being with him but I'll be there any way I can for now. Want to live with him but he's an ocean away. I shouldn't have started a relationship with an older woman when I was manic, I should have got treatment right away. If I'm wrong, I need to apologize. Thanks for reading this, and if you have any advice on what to do, please let me know. \n\n1) How to forgive them both? \n2) Should I get the DNA test?\n3) how do I co-parent when I cannot block my ex?",

I’m very close with my family and love them more than anything. He on the other hand doesn’t share the same close relationship with his family, and thinks parents should “let their kids fly away”. He also doesn’t like to have a detailed plan for his future, and just wants to “see what happens” rather than having a rigid plan in life. I’m not a meticulous planner, but I do like to have an idea of where my life is heading and if we share the same goals.\n\nI love the city and country we moved to, and could definitely see myself here long term if it weren’t for my family back home. He doesn’t want to move back home anytime soon because of the job opportunities here, and I would feel guilty making him move back to our home country just so I could be near my family, if it was not something he truly wanted and just did to make me happy.  \n\nI love him so much and see a future with him, and he loves me too and would like us to get married one day, but this is one big thing that I am struggling with. Is there any sort of compromise that can be made? Have any of you been in a similar position and have any advice?

I’ve tried that a few times myself and it’s been hit or miss. I almost got cussed out one time and I got pushed another time. \n\nI don’t get it. If these women are straight then why wouldn’t they want to dance or grind with a guy. I don’t know if I should just keep trying to get behind girls or smack them on the butt but trying to ask them to dance always fails. I’ve never had it work when I tried to just be polite and ask for a dance. I guess women don’t think that’s confident.\n\nI’m saying this because this is what I keep seeing every time I go. Sometimes girls dance with me and sometimes they won’t but they always dance with other girls. It low key feels like being a woman is a lot more fun than being a man.

I talked with him about this before I agreed to go out with him as well as the fact I have been diagnosed with generalised anxiety and I have prescribed medication for it and he was okay with it all and still wanted to go out with me. This is also my first time posting on Reddit so I apologise if this is a weird layout or it’s not that interesting.\n\nAnyways, Me and him have been dating for about 3 1/2 Months and before we were friends for about 6/7 months and honestly I don’t think I ever have seen him as someone who I would get into a relationship in. I think I liked the idea of him but not actually him but I tricked myself into thinking I liked him. Mentioning this I might of even answered my own question but moving in from that.\n\nWhen he asked me to go out with him I said yes but as time moved on I don’t think I like him. I kind of dread talking to him, I want to avoid spending time with him (I’ve made excuses not to spend time with him twice out of the 30ish times we hung out and I did try make it up to him after), I hate when anyone finds out we’re together, he’s gotten really cocky recently as well or it could be how he normally acts but just not around me, in addition my friend who was his wingman has also blocked him as he made fun of international woman’s day and was really sexist about it when they brought it up. On another occasion, I got grounded because i missed my curfew and he ended up guilt tripping me to spend time with him and lying to my mum (i live at her house and my parents are divorced) as I wouldn’t be able to spend time with him otherwise and that still doesn’t sit right with me.\n\nThing is he’s also so really sweet. He gets me my favourite sweets, food, stuffed animals, told his family about me, all his friends about me and has stopped talking to a lot of his female friends for me even though I trust him and the girls but he said he doesn’t want to accidentally flirt with them. He wants to spend time with me and has told me he likes to do anything if it’s with me and when he’s sweet to me I feel so happy but even that feeling has started to wear off and I don’t know if this is normal to feel this way about a relationship.\n\nThe biggest problem if we do end up breaking up is we have recently chose our GCSE options and he decided to take 2 of the classes that I also chose one of them because I’m taking it. I have always wanted to do the GCSEs I picked so their is no way in hell I’m switching but both classes are so small that I’m worried that if I break up with him all those classes would be really awkward and I would grow to hate the subjects. I also would even know where to start with actually breaking up with him\n\nTLDR; I overtime i think I realised I don’t want to date my boyfriend anymore or I want to figure a way to fix my relationship with him.",

        "text": "(Throwaway) I (28F) want to move out. I live with my older sister and father. I’ve wanted to move out for over five years but each attempt I’ve made to address it has gone horribly wrong. I will admit, my living situation could be described as comfortable in comparison to others. We have a decent sized 3 bedroom apartment, I’m in the master bedroom. My sister cooks meals for us almost every day, but I feel as though I can’t be truly happy here. The reason being is my father. I still love him, but I have heavy resentments I’ve been unable to heal from. I haven’t been given the proper space to make peace with everything and I feel I’ve been forced to bend to his will for for too long. My sister is the opposite. Her strained relationship is with our mother and she is really close with our father. Our father and mother were divorced after we finished highschool. During the whole divorce process we heavily took our father’s side, and now I feel I can empathize with what she went through  since that maltreatment fell upon me. It’s a long story, but the apartment being rented is solely in mine and my sister’s names. He is living with us, he works out of the apartment, he stores all his tools here, and he stores a few project cars here but he also stays half of the week with his girlfriend. I feel like our place is just used as his warehouse. The apartment is digusting, he tried to harass me into letting him use my credit, and we were harassed by court servers and collections because of him years ago. \n\nMy sister is comfortable. We live in a nice area, the weather is very important to her, and the situation is affordable to us. Moving is a hassle and I know she doesn’t want to put in that effort when she feels it’s not necessary. She’s not just my sister, she’s my best friend and I would literally take a bullet for her. I don’t want to be separated. It’s a big reason I stayed this way for so long but I would do what I have to. She’s cool with whatever I want to do, but will not EVER insert herself into the conflict or take a side. I feel like maybe I should be upset with how passive she is but I can’t bring myself to be angry. We went through so much during their divorce. I do not want to live with my mother either.\n\nI’ve asked multiple times to move out throughout the years but it’s gone horribly wrong every time.   My father gets really aggressive. I have to say he has NEVER gotten physical, but he does have horrible anger problems. Yelling, stomping, spamming messages, etc to the point where you can’t function for work the next day (nor can he). Recently he has gotten better. I feel like he had tried to listen the few times I’ve attempted to speak out but the damage is already done. I still really don’t like talking to him, I hold out in my room most of the time until my sister comes home. He did recently bring up that he would be up to moving out since his girlfriend wants help with her rent and to go full time with him. This made me unbelievably happy, but bitter too. It wasn’t because I asked and I know its not going to be anytime soon. He said he still has to fix up the cars and sell them, but who knows how long that will take. He doesn’t hold well to his words. If I left the decision to my sister and father I would be stuck here for so many more years to come.\n\nI want to get out of here. That might be impossible financially for just me and it may fracture my relationship with my father beyond repair. The ideal would be my sister and I living on our own with out having to deal with our parents. This might just be more of a vent, I know I’m an adult and I can force myself out but I’m scared of all the repercussions. \n\n(TLDR) I want to move out of my apartment, but my father has very extreme reactions when it’s not beneficial to him. I just want options on how I can go about this and to hear other experiences.",

He recently got this job- it pays him better than he has ever seen and I am so happy for him because it’s an automotive job (which he is a car enthusiast). I had my job first and it pays me alright as a woman that loves to help and working with people of disabilities. \n\nWe have come to a pickle where, I’ll wake up in the morning and he’s gone for work. When he gets home, I’m at work already. Once I get off - he is already asleep. So I never get to talk about my day or visit with him Monday through Friday. On the weekends he expresses he needs to make time for family and friends. Which feels like to me he prioritizes first. \n\nI’ve asked to spend a bit more time together on weekends or little as play with my hair to help me sleep once getting home when I have my chronic migraines. He expresses he is being asked to much and I “nag” and I have no respect for his rest or life outside of me. I’ve tried to tone down and let things be what they are but then he says I’m detaching. He starts to not answer my texts through the day and distance himself when he sees I stop “nagging” because if “ I’m on that shit then he is too”.\n\nHe has been on the line of breaking up and so have I because it feels like we have “no time” for a relationship. But we both don’t want to be without each other. He has gotten emotional about the importance of each other  but he doesn’t make an effort???\n\nDo I want this relationship more? and do I continue to detach to self prioritize or do I see this through to make a sacrifice for someone I love? \n\nHe also likes to make time to work on his own project car which creates more of a distance between him and I. I am more introverted and don’t like to make useless friends and be friendly with acquaintances- but he does. So I am more available than him but I do it for a desire of him and valuable time together. \n\nTL;DR He makes me feel like I control him or want to posses him but I feel like I’m asking for almost the bare minimum? Am I being THAT girl?? I can’t ask close friends because they will do the “fuck him girl and move on” but I want HIM.",

Besides that, even on days he is feeling more fine, he isn't sure if he wants to continue being with me regardless of his depression.\n\nI am/was willing to wait for him, but it feels like he has SO much to deal with before even getting to the issues in our relationship. He'll often say he really can't take any more and the last thing he wants to be worrying about right now is us/our relationships/his feelings for me. \n\nTo be honest I've forgotten the good times. How he treated me well, the fun we had. It's all a distant memory now. We barely talk and there is no more emotional closeness or romance. Objectively I wouldn't even call us friends from our interactions, more random acquaintances if anything. But we're still \"together\". \n\nI've talked to him about it a million times already and he'll just give me less than nothing every time. In the beginning him being distant and cold was so incredibly hurtful and confusing, I tried to understand it, be patient. Now I barely care anymore. When I see him there's still something there between us, I guess that's what's kept me hopeful up to this point.\n\nLike I said I didn't mind waiting for him or supporting him through hard times. I can do without romance, intimacy. I love him. But I can't live like this, without any closeness, effort or interest. None. And I realized I can't be with someone who can turn cold on me like that, because communication means everything to me. \n\nNow I feel conflicted on whether or no to end it. I'm thinking more about how it will affect him. The last thing I want is to make him spiral and do the one thing he asked me not to. Maybe he doesn't care, I really don't know anymore. Just worried how he'll take it. \n\nI don't want to date other people either, want to still be his friend and support him. Basically nothing would change from the way it is now. Part of me thinks I should just move on/detach emotionally without really talking about it (part of me feels like he already did as well) and then when the biggest issues in his life are past him we can have that break up talk? \n\nIs that a horrible idea?\n\n**tl;dr**: My partner has been depressed for 6 months and dealing with a lot of heavy things. We've basically not had any form of a relationship since. My romantic feelings are gone. I still want to be there for him and be his friend, but I don't want to add a breakup to the list of his worries right now. Is it okay for me to move on emotionally and have the breakup conversation later?",

I don’t know what to accept as ‘satisfactory’. He’s already said he regrets hurting me; should I expect him to admit his behaviour was ‘wrong’? Should i expect him to be somehow making it up to me? \n\n(Note, yes I am emotionally prepared for him to raise grievances against me and I will take them seriously)\n\nTl;dr my (now ex-)partner did something shitty to me, over which I ended the relationship.

        "text": "I met Jake 4 years ago in what some might call a “meet-cute”. We just happened to bump into each other and everything clicked. I have a previous post on here talking about my unending love for him and our crazy history. But here’s the Tl;dr: \n- 20 yo man meets 26 yo woman, we vibe \n- Frequent mind-blowing sex turns into a whirlwind relationship\n- Pandemic brings us very close, codependent. We felt empty and uncomfortable when the other wasn’t around. Much love was had by all.\n- Mania and drug/alcohol addiction on his side blows the relationship up in slow motion\n- Both walk away absolutely destroyed\n\nI couldn’t get over him for a long time, but because of the damage from the fallout of our breakup, I swore him off, and all men his age, and just… got on with my life. I guess I sort of fooled myself into thinking I was over him because of this swearing off. Not the same thing as moving on as I learned.\n\nAnother thing to note is that when it comes to financial/education/career matters, Jake and I are far from equally yoked. Jake has no education after high school, and he had a hard time holding down a job. When he had one it was always waiting tables. I work in tech, and I’m quickly approaching making 3 times as much as he used to as a waiter. He makes very little right now because he is unemployed, which I will explain more later.\n\nI hit dating apps and I met Harvey. Like with Jake, we had a lot of fun together. He makes almost twice as much as me so it was a different kind of fun. The tables turned in a big way from Jake to Harvey. He’s very tall and attractive. That along with his income meant he could be selective in dating. He made me feel like Miss Right-Now instead of Miss Right a lot of the time. He could be very critical of both himself and others. He also had a bit of a drinking problem and when he got drunk, he would voice the things he wished were different about me. He said I had a pretty face but he wanted me to be thinner, and more muscular/athletic. He didn’t take much interest in my hobbies. He was a man who knew what he wanted who was disinterested in other things. The reason we broke up is because he “broke up” with me without actually meaning it 3 times. He often made me feel disposable and unimportant. \n\nWith that said, he was very affectionate and cuddly. He was generous and always honest (to a fault sometimes). Harvey and I were best friends. I called him my twin flame. Separate we were candles burning bright but together we were a raging bonfire. Both in tech, we developed software together. He coached me to snag a huge raise and I coached him to develop a game. My favorite thing about him was that he was always growing and changing. He always wanted to be a better version of himself in the future, and I love that energy.\n\nThe sex wasn’t good. It was almost clinical. I had a much higher drive than him so I was always hungry for him but came away feeling a unsatisfied when he’d throw me a “bone” (lol). When we broke up, I was actively setting up appointments with a sex therapist to try and have more passion in our relationship.\n\nWhen Harvey and I broke up, his world, his walls and ego, came crashing down. He didn’t realize until I was really gone how much I meant to him. He misses me terribly and would do anything to win me back.\n\nAfter Harvey and I broke up I thought “I wonder how Jake has been?” I had wondered this many times but Harvey wasn’t comfortable with me making contact, and I respected that completely. I asked him once and never brought it up again. This time I could actually reach out and ask. Well as it turns out we never got over each other. It clicked just as easily as the first time.\n\nNow I have 2 men that literally want to marry me. \n\nA few months ago Jake had a massive family tragedy and broke his 2 year sobriety until he started outpatient rehab. He just graduated and I believe he will have another job waiting tables or working in a nursing home in a couple weeks. He plans to start community college after that. The most important development for him is that he was diagnosed with bipolar 1 after we broke up and he has spent the last couple years perfecting his medication regimen with his doctor. The mania is under control. But he has a lot of catching up to do before he’s ready to settle down. He’s done the emotional work and now he has the financial work in front of him.\n\nHarvey is the complete opposite. He has done all the financial work and he has a lot of emotional work in front of him. He’s doing the work too. He’s in an anger management group as well as he’s seeing a psychiatrist, his normal therapist, and a hypnosis specialist (?) He stopped drinking. He realizes his shortcomings and has been obsessively working on them.\n\nI broke up with Harvey 2 months ago and reconnected with Jake 1 month ago. It is FAR too early to make a decision but ultimately I do think I will wind up spending my life with one of them. I know they will both wait unless I tell them explicitly there is no chance we will ever get back together. What should I look out for? On what do I base my decision? I feel like financial stability and intimate connection are both pretty important things for me in a partner. \n\nIs it wrong for me to be seeing Jake right now? We’ve limited our contact to 1/week phone calls and every 4th week we meet up in person. Still I wonder if it’s immoral. Would it be wrong for me to have a similarly distant relationship with Harvey at the same time?\n\nI really want to do the right thing, both for myself and for each of these men that I really do love and care for deeply. Please don’t judge me too harshly.\n\nTl;dr - Two of my exes, Harvey and Jake, are both madly in love with me. Harvey is financially in a good place but he has some work to do on himself emotionally. Jake has done more emotional work and needs time to develop financial stability. How do I decide between them, and how should I conduct myself in the mean time to not string them along?",

My husband is a pipe welder. \n\nMy husband goes to a lot of out of state jobs for turn arounds mostly during the spring and fall and can be gone anywhere from 2 weeks to 2 months, sometimes longer if the job pays enough and has enough work. It's usually only twice a year that he is gone on these trips and is usually within a few hours drive it's rare that he is farther away that that. \n\nThis is normal for us, we've been together for 12 years and he's been doing this for most of those years. He is gone currently, he left a few days ago and will be gone about 3 weeks or so. I can hold down the fort, it's fine. I am not in an unsafe area at all. We live in a farm community and I know every farmer around me. It is extremely rare that someone isn't coming over to borrow our tractor or the welder or buy eggs from me. Not to mention having random kids always running around with my kids and having their parents over. I'm rarely ever alone. However there is a road that is about a half mile away and if there isn't anything planted you can easily see into my yard and see if my husband's truck is there. \n\nThe issue is every time my husband leaves my grandmother shows up and tries to spend the night or convince me that it's unsafe or whatever she comes up with to stay here. She isn't homeless she is just the type of person that is very manipulative and constantly needs to be all up in everyone's business. I have never once allowed her to stay. \n\nI cannot stand my grandmother, every thing is backhanded with her. She constantly has something rude to say about this or that with my home half the time she shows up here she is with a friend and expects me to put up my dogs that protect my chickens and goats or she will throw a fit because a chicken gets too close to her ( none of my animals are mean). It's just constantly something with her. She also constantly has something to say about my marriage but she's been married 7 times. She shouldn't be giving anyone marriage advice. \n\nShe does this to everyone in the family but I was her \"favorite grandchild\".\n\nI do not let my children alone with her because she is either going to manipulate them into giving her information on whoever is her target at the moment or she gets too touchy. Specifically the touchy thing, she used to force me to sleep in the bed with her when I was little and to this day it gives me severe anxiety that she may do that to one of my children. I do not trust her at all. \n\nShe also has a lot to say about my children because I couldn't have biological children. She constantly reminds me that she birthed 6 children before she was 30 and asks me when I'm going to give her real grandchildren. The only time she pretends to love my children is when she brings her friend then they are her favorite great grandchildren and she likes to talk about everything they do and all of their accomplishments that she's never shown up for. This is really the only thing that infuriates me and she's learned not to let me hear anything she says about my children or to let me see her messing with my children. Everything else is just annoying but not infuriating. \n\nThis has been years in the making and I've told her hundreds of times to stop, I'm not nice about it. I don't pretend it's okay. I stone wall her most of the time but nothing works with her. She simply keeps doing it. If I locked the gate she will simply park and walk and then throw a fit that I dare to lock the gate and she is in so much pain walking so far. If I force her to leave she throws a fit ( again she does this to everyone). \n\nI'm so sick of this. If my husband is home he normally curses her out and she huffs and leaves but I am not someone that can treat someone like that, I just can't. \n\nWhat should I do?\n\nTdlr- my grandmother is an awful person and I'm tired of dealing with her.",

I’ve proved that untrue. She came to mine and my boyfriend’s house and my mum followed her by tracking her phone. My mum let herself in because I hadn’t locked the door, she shouted at me, shouted at my sister, called me a danger to children, told me I shouldn’t be having children and she’d call social services. My boyfriend heard this so he came into the room shouted at her and told her to get out or he’d call the police.

        "text": "Girlfriend doesn't like dancing with me.\n\nHello I have a girlfriend that I have been with for a out 4 months now.. she has been dancing with her male friend for years at a country dance salon. Now I knew that when she told me and said it was fine. Since we started as bf and gf I thought well she can dance with me and her male friend like a 50/50 where she still gets to dance with her male friend but also dance with me her boyfriend evenly. I didn't think that was asking to much or being unfair. \n\nBut when I told her she started crying acting like I told her she couldn't dance or hangout with her friend anymore. She told me that, going to the country salon dance hall was her and her friends thing and she didn't want it to become a thing with me and her. She would get mad when she danced with me more then him. She told me that she doesn't get excited when I go and have to dance with her because she gets less dancing time with her friend. The one time we went by ourself without him she was not excited at all and just wanted to sit down.  would tell her let's go dance and she would say no, until iI convinced her to dance and even then I could tell she was not enjoying it at all.. Am I in the wrong for getting mad and upset? She said she was being selfish and doesn't care. I told her well I just won't go with her anymore so she could dance with her friend and she started crying?? I thought that's what she wanted?? I offered to take country dance classes so I could get better but she said thanks for the effort but no thanks. Now of course I got hurt after hearing her say that doesn't want to dance with me at all and while trying to put effort into learning to dance better but she pretty much said even if you got better at dancing I still would not dance with you, and much rather dance with her friends. \n\nTL;DR: Is there something I'm missing? I need outside opinions please. Other then the dancing part everything else is fine.\n\nThanks",

        "text": "Me(20 M) and a friend(20 F) started talking back in September of ‘22. Things started to pick up gradually between her and I. We both agreed on the “3 month rule,” (basically you stay in the talking stage for three months to see if you get along well, also it is known that people start to show their true selves after about 3 months of dating) our three months would have been in early December. The day before our three months was over she tells me we should go back to being friends for a while, although she never told me why. I didn’t sleep for two days because I was trying to think of every possible scenario where I might have done something wrong. About two weeks later we are hanging and being just friends, I take the opportunity to ask why. She responded with, “I am dealing with a lot of mental issues right now, I get manic out of nowhere and I don’t want to take my episodes out on you.” When I heard that I automatically thought the classic “it’s not you it’s me” bs that people like to pull in order to not hurt your feelings. She assured me that she was being truthful and she just needs time to herself for a while but that we could still be friends. \n\nNow I understand having mental issues and them causing the end of relationships and friendship’s because my sister was the same way. I went along with it, now there have been at least 4 times that I can think of that her and I would be hanging out and she does things to get “close” to me(putting her head on my chest, giving me the “I want you smirk,” etc.) and I know that’s what she was doing because she’d admit to it. On top of all of this we have been in two major arguments in the past 3 months because I have always done something wrong, but anytime I mentioned something she did that hurt or upset me she’d excuse it or dodge the topic and blow it off. I still have feeling for her and care about her even after everything, but I feel like the best thing for me and her both is to distance ourselves from each other. What do you guys think?(there is a lot more info to this than what I posted so I can answer any questions in the comments)\nTL;DR- Girl and had a relationship, she cut it short without telling me why.",

I’ve tried that a few times myself and it’s been hit or miss. I almost got cussed out one time and I got pushed another time. \n\nI don’t get it. If these women are straight then why wouldn’t they want to dance or grind with a guy. I don’t know if I should just keep trying to get behind girls or smack them on the butt but trying to ask them to dance always fails. I’ve never had it work when I tried to just be polite and ask for a dance. I guess women don’t think that’s confident. \n\nTl;dr I don’t know how to approach women at a club",

        "text": "My Girlfriend confessed to me last night that she doesn't think that she loves me anymore and that she has wanted to break up for a while, she also told me that she doesn't find me attractive anymore. This has broken me and I am currently at the lowest point that I have ever been and I need you all to help me as best you can.\n\nMy Girlfriend has always been a fiery and strong willed Individual, so much so that I had to fight to get certain things to change that she did during our Relationship because they seriously bothered me and affected me mentally. Things like how she sleeps nude in a house where her entire family walks into her room whenever they want at any time and pull the covers off of her and walk in on her changing clothes without intention to do so but nonetheless it has happened.\n\nDuring our Relationship we have had arguments and fights about many things. I made her sleep in at-least her bra and pants, I made her wrap her towel around her completely whenever she got out of the shower as she would crookedly hold the towel over her back which left her entire front exposed and she would walk around like that. I made her understand that I will never permit her to have Guy friends because I know of their nature and what would most likely happen between them. I also made her stop using TikTok because of the amount of Pornographic Content on there that would appear on both mine and her FYP's, we both stopped using it.\n\nI have always been Insecure about myself and my body and due to this Insecurity I have made Rules but I have always made sure to not be extreme and try to make things as easy for her, but she has told me how she hates not having her freedom and said that she's sick of it. At first when she originally told me this I made changes and tried to be more lenient but asked her to be respectful of me and how I feel which she pretty much didn't and it really fucked me up.\n\nLast night I wanted to speak to her after not talking to her since the night prior since I had to sleep early for a Driving Test I had early today to get my Licence to drive to see her. To which she told me she's playing with her friend instead of wanting to spend time with me, I then asked her why she isn't interested about my Day and why she doesn't want to hear how it went because I had good news to tell her (I passed my test).\n\nShe then proceeded to ask me to \"fuck off\" when I asked her why she thinks it's okay to prioritise her friend that she doesn't even know over me during something important. After her telling me that she just doesn't care I was deeply hurt and decided to lay down and just clear my head, and then I decided to check who she was playing with and it turns out it was a guy who she knew for a while before meeting me and I'm almost certain they had a history of flirting/relationship.\n\nShe had lied to me about who she was playing with and purposely hid the fact that the person she was prioritising me over was a guy and she instead wanted to voice call with him and play with him instead of me, this completely destroyed my trust and hit me like a freight train. I then confronted her and that's when she told me she doesn't think that she loves me anymore and thinks I'm not attractive anymore.\n\nWe haven't actually broken up yet, last night she told me that she wants to break up and be single again and to which I asked if we could try and change things up to see if there's still things left because if it's going to end with her leaving me then I want to try regardless and she responded saying she's not sure.\n\nPlease can you all help me out, I poured my soul into our relationship and losing her would be the worst thing imaginable for me right now. Please give me your advice and thank you for reading.\n\nTL;DR I'm (M17) losing my Girlfriend (F16) and I can't handle it",

        "text": "My boyfriend has an ex who openly hates me. Her and I used to be mutuals on social media because we went to the same HS. We never interacted irl, would only occasionally hype eachother up on IG, and our only notable interaction is when we both ranted about our exes together on IG dm, because we just so happened to be going through breakups at the same time. Her ex now being my boyfriend. I did not know her ex, only by name, never interacted with him before, and only met him at a party 3 months later through mutual friends. We just ended up really liking eachother. \n\nAfter word got out, she sent me a hateful message on instagram calling me a b!tch and saying karma is gonna get me and I’m a snake in the grass. Okay. I’ll take it. I responded saying “I’m sorry, I had no intentions of this happening, and I’d probably be just as upset as you”. Nothing else was said. My boyfriend then took it into his own hands to say something to her along the lines of “hey man, relax, live and let live”. Verbatim, live and let live. Remember that. \n\nSo it’s now been a year+ of us being together, have not heard anything from her since. Up until last week. He got a notification that his ex liked his photo on instagram. They do not follow eachother, so clearly she was doing some snooping and liked his post about him and his accomplishments at culinary school. He told me it made him uncomfortable, and he blocked her. We both maturely discussed it, and chalked it up to her seeing he’s doing good and wanted to show some love. But me being me, I decided to look at her twitter to see if I could find out more. Low and behold, her most recent tweet said “Getting hard to live and let live out here babes”. Directly quoting the last thing he said to her. That cannot be a coincidence, since it was tweeted right after she liked his photo. I did more of a twitter deep dive - she clearly misses him and is still upset. \n\nAnyways, I have a TikTok, with quite a few followers, and I decided to make a post joking about how “my bf’s ex liked his picture”. Immature, sure. But no harmful intentions. I’m a young woman who’s audience is young women, so I figured it would be relatable &amp; funny. No names were dropped. Got a couple likes and laughs. The next day, I get a comment from someone I do not know saying “no one wants his abusive good for nothing ass” referring to my boyfriend. This comment came from a friend of hers. Abuse is a serious allegation, and although I do not know what exactly happened in their relationship, I do know there was cheating done on both parts, and he just pretty much did not show up for her the way she wanted him to. He has never said one negative thing about his ex, and seems to fully take accountability for being a dumbass. Teenage immaturity it seems, since they dated all through out high school. And their most recent breakup was mutual, btw. \n\nMy boyfriend has not shown any abusive tendencies in the year+ we’ve been together. I have been in abusive relationships. He is not an abuser. So I took it into my hands to reach out to her and ask her not to send people over to my social media to make allegations like that. I also said how she’s tweeting about missing him, liking his picture, meanwhile sending her minions out to say he’s an abuser. She then responded basically telling me I’m the reason she is suffering and that I “play the victim on the internet” but that “I know what I did to her” in reference to dating her ex 4 months after they broke up. She also says she doesn’t use social media but some how my stuff always ends up being sent to her… like why do you have people looking at my accounts for you? I really cannot tell if I am the one in the wrong or if she is now dragging it out way too much and is causing problems. Any advice or input? I’m willing to take any feedback, lol. \n\nTL;DR- my boyfriends ex hates me for dating him and is now sending people to call him an abuser on my social media, meanwhile she tweets about missing him and likes his instagram posts.",
