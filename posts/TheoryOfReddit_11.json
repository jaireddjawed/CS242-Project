        "text": "It's not just abortion, that's just an example so let's please not get bogged won in that debate. /That's the first issue that caught my eye. Imagine these two posts on TwoXChromosomes, for example:\n\n1) \"I'm pro-choice, but I can understand where pro-life people are coming from. They want to ban abortion because they believe it's a living child\".\n\n2) \"I'm pro-life, and I want to ban abortion because I believe it's a living child.\"\n\nOkay, so both statements are the same. The same emotion and tone, the same argument presented. The only difference is, advertisement of which ''camp'' you belong to.\n\nThe first one has at least a chance of being treated like a post worthy of discussion, thoughtful responses, and maybe upvotes. The second would be immediately downvoted on sight with people scoffing or making angry one-liners underneath it.\n\nYou also see this played out in voting and election discussions.\n\n1) \"Look, I voted for Clinton but I am sympathetic to why rural people voted for Trump. It's because they believe XYZ\"\n\n2) \"I am a rural person who voted for Trump because I believe XYZ\"\n\nAgain, first one would be treated like a genuine post deserving of reasoned responses, second would be mocked and hidden by 100 downvotes.\n\nYou also see it in nonpolitical posts. There was a discussion on r/starwars the other day where a guy said ''I hate the prequels as much as anyone else, but you have to admit there were some good things about them\" and it resulted in a civil discussion. A few weeks ago someone had posted \"I loved the prequels because XYZ\" and it got a much more frosty reception.\n\nIs there a psychological phenomenon behind this? Anyone else noticed it?",

Previously I just kept the preference \"allow subreddits to show me custom themes\" unchecked, enabled custom stylesheets on these couple of subreddits and called it a day. The individual subreddit stylesheet options are a gold feature.\n\nIn the past day or so there has been a change where if the \"allow subreddits to show me custom themes\" option is unchecked, like I used to have it, enabling a custom stylesheet for just a single subreddit is impossible. The sidebar checkbox to enable custom CSS simply doesn't exist if the option is unchecked. Now to go back to having all but two subreddits show me the default stylesheet, I need to keep the preference checked and disable custom stylesheets on **every other subreddit that I visit**.\n\nSo when previously I could have the option unchecked and opt in to custom stylesheets on two subreddits, I now have to keep the option checked and opt out of custom stylesheets on n minus two subreddits. That's a lot of work!\n\nI don't understand. Why would reddit remove some of the functionality their site previously had? Could this be related to the upcoming CSS changes?",

Now, a few hours later, I notice that those threads aren't showing up anymore, and my feed isn't filled with \"old content\" anymore.\n\nOn the contrary, I'm seeing a lot of interesting content from smaller subs that I usually wouldn't see. I just had the opportunity to be the first reply to a 15 minutes old thread with 2 upvotes, which felt refreshing after 6 years on reddit.\n\n---\n\nAnyone else noticed this?

I think that if this trend is left unchecked, it could snowball into FatPeopleHate 2.0.\n\nThere's long been speculation that after FPH was banned, many of the users went to The_Donald, and now that the election is long past and the excitement of having a meme-president is starting to wear off, I could see a lot of those people returning to beating the dead horse that is fat activists. The coincidence of Trump's highly controversial (to his base) gun control comments and the emergence of a new fat activist to hate on this week could be the catalyst for a major shift in reddit culture.\n\nSorry if this is a bit of a mess, like I said I just had this thought a few minutes ago so I haven't had time to flesh it out too much.

        "text": "I usually try to view all reddit threads of videos, articles, etc. to gain a greater perspective on how different people view the same thing. Recently, however (as in, perhaps the past month or so), I've noticed something interesting happening: [people are often crossposting to their own personal profiles](https://i.imgur.com/KIALfZq.png).\n\nOne of my first thoughts was that this might be some attempt at karma farming, but these people don't have a following, nor are their posts upvoted by anyone, so that's not really a possibility.\n\nNearly all the people I've seen doing this are either very new to reddit (usually a few months), or have been largely lurking for a year or two. So perhaps the crossposting is due to inexperience with reddit, and maybe an attempt to emulate similar actions on other platforms that *do* have meaningful results, such as reblogging on Tumblr, sharing on Facebook, or retweeting on Twitter. (Some might even go so far as to suggest that this is evidence of Reddit (the company)'s alleged goal of turning reddit into a more generic social media site is working, but I'm not sure that conclusion is warranted.)\n\nAlternatively, these people might just be using their personal profiles as a collection of things they find interesting, akin to the Saved page but public. I have no clue why anyone would do that (I mean, I have seen people make personal subreddits just for this purpose, but at least those have the benefit over the Saved page of being searchable, while your personal profile is not), but perhaps that's why only newer and/or mostly lurking redditors seem to be doing this.\n\nThoughts?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/80ccqa/barrier_of_entry_in_reddits_popular_quality/",
        "text": "In addition to truly bad quality subreddits full of boring memes and low-hanging fruits, with top-level comments more often than not a reaction gif or something equally useless, there's always been a number of popular subreddits that position themselves as \"quality\" question / answer / discussion subs.\n\nOriginally, the \"tough\" level of moderation in said subreddits did indeed cause a major increase in quality, especially compared to the majority of Reddit. However, there's a certain thing I've been noticing over the last couple of years: the tough moderation seems to self-select towards progressively longer rulebooks and pedantic enforcement, to the point that many of the previously active communities are now often looking relatively ghostly, even if the subscriber numbers compared to their earlier times have increased dramatically.\n\nLet me explain what I mean: certain scientific subreddits (like /r/askscience) are completely paralysed by their rules by now, with pre-moderation and strict enforcement making asking questions a *very* difficult process with the mod team expecting prospective questioners to read through walls of text and conform  **strictly** to every little subsection before *maybe* getting their question posted. My attempts of using that subreddit have thus far met with 0% success rate, with attempted posts \"ghosted\" waiting for confirmation without ever getting it nor receiving a reason for denial. I guess that's one way of keeping the quality high, but it sure ruins the ability for many people to use the community as they were intended.\n\nEven more blatant example is /r/askhistorians. That particular subreddit decided to not only pedantically enforce the rules as far as taking down a huge number of potential questions (my personal success - about 1/3), but also turned the answering area into a mini-academic institution with formatting resembling scientific papers requiring sourcing. While it may help history students get some practice in writing on their subjects, but that's not supposed to be the point of a community like that. [Here's an example that I just stumbled upon](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/804plz/what_might_happen_if_during_segregation_a_white/duu2olj/) randomly which shows just how incredibly high the barrier of entry to answering questions is there, and [here is](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/8062hn/why_did_the_soviets_invade_afghanistan/dutwx6z/), I think, the absolute **top** example of oppressive \"universitization\" of it. The moderator admits that the answer seems fine, but the sources (which are there!) are not *quite* up to his standards - he suggests that the poster cleans up the \"references\" to be more in line with a North American university style and resubmit. Of course we have no way to know what the comment said originally (it could have been atrocious), but that's the point - we'll never find out unless the original author decides to waste a few hours of his time digging through relevant literature.\n\nObviously, that's not all the subreddits that suffer from this kind of problem - my favourite community has now less postings per day than it did three years ago when it had maybe 10% of current subscribers - but I think there's no need to bore you with mere enumeration of communities suffering from this issue. \n\nHere's the actual question - do you believe that this sort of \"quality control\" is really justified in what is, after all, an entertainment website? Should unpaid responders really be expected to spend their time reading through pages of rules and write university-style scientific papers just to have their comment stay up in a \"quality\" subreddit?\n\nFinally: is \"maintaining quality\" to this extent important enough to vindicate a drop in submissions and comments by orders of magnitude? Does this level of pedantic regulation really keep the quality of the subreddit up? Is there a way to find a middle ground between /r/AdviceAnimals and /r/AskHistorians? If so - how?",

        "text": "Has anyone noticed this?\n\n- r/okcupid is a very insular community made up of the same 30-40 people, the sub functions in a very eerie cultish way. It reminds me of a high school lunch table group. It's heavily politically leftwing with all discussions geared towards the more progressive/feminist stance towards general dating culture. Newcomers are treated with suspicion and sometimes downright hostility until they prove themselves. There are \"sub hotties\" (yes this is a real term), aka women and some men who post their pictures on all of the pic threads and get known for being attractive relative to the rest of the userbase. These people are treated like royalty and revel in upvotes and PMs. Every discussion they're part of seems to involve someone reminding them of their good looks, even in irrelevant situations. The sub even has a term \"reg\" for the most prominent members of the community; usernames begin to become recognizable after spending just a few days reading threads here. There's an underclass of a handful of people who are widely disliked and constantly downvoted, but still have been making daily troll posts for months to years. Threads having nothing to do with OKC are often upvoted under the veneer of being kind of related to dating maybe - for example a lot  articles about celebrity sexual assault scandals made their way to the frontpage every few days. In effect, r/okcupid seems less like a sub devoted to discuss OkCupid and more of a hangout for a group of acquaintances to shoot the shit and chat with each other.\n\n- r/tinder is a heavily shitposty and image-based sub. Literally 90%+ of the upvoted threads are either someone making a pun out of a girl's name or making some kind of semi-funny joke. It's by far the most popular of the dating app subs, with several dozens of posts made per day. There's very little actual discussion here - no advice, no nuclear community, etc - mostly people making jokes and treating it like the Tinder version of r/funny. It's politically centrist, with a strong brogressive streak of people claiming they're liberal but complaining about women or talking shit about feminism. This subreddit reminds me most of the rest of Reddit, in its demographics and tone.\n\n- then you have the mass of smaller subs. r/bumble, r/coffeemeetsbagel, etc. These barely get any traffic at all (10 threads a day on a good day?) and all the discussions are dry topics. Like how to message girls, why does XYZ not work, glitches in the apps, etc. Very little humor, very little community.\n\nWhy are all these subs so markedly different in character, despite being all dating app related?",

I'd say that about half the time my posts are not valid due to not following formatting rules of subreddits, and I don't really have time to read the rules for each time I post on a new (to me) subreddit. I can skim over them, but having time to read them thoroughly isn't often he case.\n\nIs anyone else put off by the red tape? So serious! This years old trend is something I notice across platforms online. Also, this trend has caused me to be post averse.",
