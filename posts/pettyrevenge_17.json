Everyone in the house despises my mom and refuses to associate with her. \n\n(S&amp;L on the phone, I’m standing next to S, L is upstairs)\nL: so I went on Hulu because I thought we had an account but probably not and I found one logged in with the names (my name) and (my oldest sisters name)\n\nMe: oh I didn’t think me logging into it on my tv would log in on the rest of the tvs. Just ignore that I guess. \n\n(Dad: wow good job)\n\nL: well I want to use it\n\nMe: well don’t. It’s not yours. \n\nS: you don’t pay for Netflix and you still use it so why can’t she?\n\nMe: do you guys really want to associate with my mom? Seriously? It’s her account, leave it alone. (Turns around)\n\nL: well I’m gonna use it anyway\n\nAnd so I went to the table for dinner, pulled out my phone, and asked my mom to boot everyone from the account. She’s not good with tech so I got to sit there, log in, and be the one to click the button to get her off the account. I don’t think they get to hate on her 24/7 (because for some reason her or other people always have to be such a big topic of conversation) and then go use her things, plus my mom is disabled and can barely feed herself. My sister could pay for Hulu better herself then my mom can and my sister is nearly 14. \n\nI don’t care if this was a bitchy thing to do. I’m glad I did it and I can’t wait for her to notice. I doubt she’ll say anything about it but still.",

        "text": "This was about 5 years ago. \n\nI'm a truck driver and when I first got my license the state kept adding endorsements to my license and every time I had to have it corrected which meant going to the secretary of state and having my current one voided and given a temporary paper license, which was stapled to the voided license for purposes of keeping my photo I.D. This was extremely frustrating as it happened about 5 or 6 times and prevented me from being able to work.\n\nI'm not a huge drinker but will from time to time. I always went to the same place (a major grocery store chain) and would usually get just a small bottle of liquor. And everytime staff needed to check my I.D. they would do so no problem because it was a completely legal state issued I.D. Once in a while an employee would be confused by the \"void\" part but once I explained the situation they understood, until one employee disagreed.\n\nShe said my license was void and she would not sell to me. I couldn't believe it but I actually pulled the \"can I speak to a manager about this?\" Surely once I explain to a manager they'll clear up the misunderstanding. Nope. Dude told me it was void and that they couldn't sell to me. I told him he was wrong, the temporary license is my current valid license and that it's only stapled to the void I.D. so that I still have a photo of me attatched. Nope. Absolutely refused. \n\nI told him that I've bought from here in the past and I will continue to do so. He made a point to say that nobody would approve of that license again.\n\nThe very next day I went back 4 seperate times and checked out with 4 seperate employees, all of which confirmed I had a valid license. After the last time I went straight to the customer service desk and asked if so and so manager was in. He was.\n\nHe walked up to me, and I handed the bag of booze over and said \"See? Told you.\"\n\nThe look on his face was everything I'd wanted. Furious yet completely baffled. He immediately asked who approved the license and I told him 4 different employees. He wanted names, I wouldn't give them. Why should I? Besides the fact I didn't take their names down, it's not their fault. They're doing their jobs and not illegally. So he gave the booze back and stormed off, and I ended up with way more alcohol than I would ever want and couldn't return haha. But it was worth it.",

        "text": "This might not be as sweet of a \"revenge\" yet, but I wanted to share. \n\nBack in 2020 I started working at what I thought was my dream company. I won't go into too much detail but it revolved around games and writing. I love both (especially writing) so I was over the moon for the opportunity. The happiness was short lived though.\nI was assigned a mentor upon arriving who was coincidentally also the unofficial supervisor for our team. This person seemed to instantly dislike me. I don't know what it was. Maybe the fact that I had previous work experience (they'd previously mainly hired students or straight out of college people) and obviously I asked for a bigger paycheck than most previous employees as I was transitioning from a job - I wasn't gonna ask for less than I was already making, obviously.\n\nWorking there was the single worst experience of my life. She obviously provided 0 mentorship, and whatever I asked she just said it was good enough etc, never gave any constructive or helpful criticism that could help me improve. I still worked really hard and still think I did a lot considering how new I was (and inexperienced for that position). On our 1-on-1s which HR, even when she didn't have work related stuff to complain about she'd say stuff like I go to the toilet too much and should could how much time I spend on the toilet and deduct it from my lunch break. \n\nI would cry after every single 1-on-1. I knew I would be let go or quit - decided to wait for the former as I knew I'd at least be monetarily compensated. When the last 1-on-1 happened she said this job just wasn't suited for me and simply wasn't good at this (insinuating I wasn't good at writing).\n\nI'd been writing since I could remember, various things. I'm not like some literary genius but for the genre I write, I'm good. This comment from her could have backfired if I was someone else... But since I have a Petty Queen living inside of me, it lit a fire under my ass. I'd been neglecting writing for several years because I was focusing on my career. \n\nI started writing a book and published it on a popular platform. It did really well, like hundreds of thousands of reads well. I wrote a second book. This second book now has a publishing deal. I'm literally going to be able to walk into a Barnes &amp; Noble and find a physical copy of my book. All because I was petty and wanted to show my ex-\"mentor\" she was wrong about me. \n\nI literally can't wait until I can publicly post about this on LinkedIn because I have her as a connection there and know she'll see it. I'm from a small European country that doesn't have English as a main language (but I taught myself native level English and write in English) so getting a book deal in the US that will be globally released is kind of a big deal. I don't know if it actually has even been achieved before by someone from my country... \n\nAnyway, I know this isn't the typical post but I wanted to share because, well, sometimes being PETTY will make your dreams come true so stay true to your petty selves, people. 💕",

        "text": "This happened in the fall at the Mall of Warts. I had shopping to do but had one item to return (a clothing item bought prior week, full price, that didn’t fit my child, tags still on. I took a cart and went to customer service. I waited in line, with my item in a bag in the top part of the cart, and my card and receipt in hand. The customer service area was full of wrapped skids on both sides, so the opening to the desk was only about 6-8 feet wide (around 2m). There was one line up the middle, people distancing, and the line extended out into the main aisleway. There were 3 staff behind the counter, 2 at the cash to my left, but no customers there, and 1 at the cash to the right. The one on the left opened and the line did start moving a bit better, but then someone that was taking a long time ended up on the left. \n\nAt the point when I’m next in line, a woman and her kid (about 8yrs) show up beside me. The woman said to me, assertively, “Mine is fast, I go before you.” She didn’t ask, she told me. There were people behind me, so letting someone in wouldn’t be fair to them. My simple return with receipt and card in hand is about the fastest thing you can do at a customer service desk. Also in my experience, sometimes people lie when they say their thing is going to be quick - since she had nothing in her hands, and she didn’t strike me as the kind of person who would come to customer service when she could bother other employees for a quick question, I knew it was possible she wouldn’t be fast. Anyway, not wanting to argue, I just said “mine is fast too.” She then said to me “Mine is faster, I go before you.” At this point I see her daughter tugging at her arm, looking uncomfortable, and saying “mom…”\n\nI was annoyed but didn’t respond. The person in front of me was taking a while with their return, so I had time to assess the situation. Then it came to me. The lady’s somewhat broken English meant she likely wouldn’t be able to assess as quickly when the transaction at the counter was wrapping up. I paid close attention to it, and as soon as the person was about to turn around to leave, I swung my cart diagonally to the right until it was almost touching the skid on the right, effectively blocking the woman from moving forward. I didn't hit her or anything, and she was able to move backwards, just not forwards. I picked up my bag with the return, walked around my empty cart, and went to the counter. As expected, my return was done within a minute. \n\nDuring that minute I overheard a conversation from behind me. The person behind me was telling the lady no, that she had to go get in line. They were more outspoken, and the info travelled down the lineup. By the time I was walking away (having retrieved my cart), the lady was shuffling down the lineup, obviously destined to go to the back. And, thanks to the time she spent beside me thinking she was going to get in front of me, she was a few spots farther back than she would have been had she just waited her turn like everyone else.",

So I told my friend that he wouldn’t do anything so we waited for him to start his pushing people around when the teacher left. He does and my friend tells him to be quiet and leave everyone alone so the bully goes over and acts like he wants to get in his face, so my friend stands up and goes towards him really quick. The bully gets so surprised and scared he takes a couple steps back and loudly poops his pants. Teacher walks back in and he’s just standing there looking like he’s going to cry and some girl tells her “_____ pooped his pants” so the teacher takes him to the office to call his mom\n\nTLDR - Bully pretends to be tough, takes the bait and poops his pants",

This dude was mean to kids when no other adults were around- often calling us stupid, in the way, waste of time, etc. \n\nHe also played the electric guitar for the praise and worship team at  church. The problem was that he always cranked the amp WAY UP and played that guitar really loudly- enough to drown out everyone else. One day between Sunday school and the main service, I was exiting the bathroom and  \"Elvis\" was at the door waiting for the bathroom. He commented, \"get out of here you stupid kid.\"\n\nAs I entered the main building I spotted his stupid guitar which was unattended and nobody else was around. I untuned his guitar making sure to turn some knobs way up and others way down. As the music started, he turned his guitar to the 150 dB level and started playing. What came out of that thing was the worst screeching, off tune garbage. I  sat back looking innocent and enjoyed watching him freak out and spend the whole time trying to retune his guitar.

I grew up on a big farm and my Grandparents were very involved in Agricultural groups, and one of them was an exchange, hosting farmers from all over the world. \nWell, my Grandparents ended up getting these white colonial farmers from Zimbabwe, and they were straight up apartheid racists. \nMy Grandfather never suffered racists well, and wasn’t super happy about hosting them, but was obliged. \nHis kids (especially my Mother) were furious about hosting these types of racists, so she executed some of the best petty revenge I’ve ever witnessed.\nThe center of life at the farm was our big swimming pool. And that summer weekend, there was an event for my extended family to meet the farmers. Well, my Mom made sure to invite her friend Ruth to swim. Ruth happens to be black. \nWhen she arrived with Ruth, the apartheid farmers were already up at the swimming pool with my Grandparents. Their jaws dropped to the floor as my Mother and Ruth introduced themselves to go swimming. While they were in the pool, the racists had a fit about sharing an area with a black person, and my Grandfather told them they aren’t in charge, people are people. After continuing their fit, he let them know that the racists do not belong staying with us. He kicked asses out mid stay! \n\nJust as my Mom had planned, she got the jerks off our farm and taught them a lesson they didn’t think they’d learn in America!",

        "text": "So I live in a quite rural part of the world. Theres lots of logging, hunting, trapping and mining that happens all around my neck of the woods and honestly I’m fine with it. I work in a field that’s affiliated with this kind of industrial work. However I’ve worked hard to make sure I live far away from other peoples BS so I don’t have to deal with this kind of stuff but of course my neighbor changed that. I moved to my home about 2 years ago, in the early summer. I’d always wanted to live here and it was perfect until the middle of my first winter here. While we were outside working my younger dog ran off into the woods (not uncommon for her, she likes to explore) but just after we started looking for her, we heard the sounds of an animal in distress not far from us. We went as quick as we could to find the source of the noise. Thats where we found our dog caught in a wolf snare, the only reason she survived was because she had put her leg through the snare as well as her head. So her leg protected her throat from full strangulation. We were able to free her and she recovered quick. I know the guy who set the traps as it turned out, hes my neighbour. When I spoke to him about he refused to take it down (even though its very close to the property line) Now for context, me (24M) and my GF (23F) love this dog so much, shes the sweetest pup and shes been through a lot (medical issues and injuries) she is a huge part of our world. My gf would be destroyed if anything happened to her. The dog did well for another year until today. I was at work when I received a call from my brother. The same dog had gone exploring while him and my gf were outside working, they heard her making sounds of distress not far away and rushed to her immediately. They found her again in a wolf trap, set by the same guy in the same place. For more context, this guy has never said anything to us about where he puts or when he sets up his traps. But its along a trail near my home that people walk and ski on, often with dogs. These traps are baited with meat to attract wolves so obviously it would attract dogs too. My brother and my gf with the help of my mom were able to free her just before I managed to get there from work. They had also run into the owner of the trap on their way out of the woods. When the confronted him he simply said our dogs shouldn’t be so dumb and it was his trapline. We told him if he didn’t dismantle the traps we would. He simply replied ‘Oh Ok’ and left. Our dog is ok and due to how close his traps are to our property we have reported him to authorities but so far we have heard nothing. So as a group me and my family have decided that if they want to threaten the safety and freedom of us and our loyal dogs, we will take it into our own hands. Starting this week we will be going up there daily to trip every single trap by hand so they can’t catch a dang thing. Dont get me wrong, I have huge respect fir hunters and trappers, but not if you’re irresponsible and trapping in what is essentially peoples backyards. I’ll make sure you never trap a wolf or anything near my home again you Ahole. Dont f*ck with my dogs.",

        "text": "This was during the 2010 winter olympics. I got a job as a parking permit checker. It was a nice gig, considering that this was during college, and that I would get some sweet olympic gear. Anyways, My job, as you might have guessed, is checking parking permits. The area I was in was the main media center, where all the journalists would hang out, and the athletes would come in to do their post sport interviews. Because the area was considered important, especially since it the area also housed the olympic flame, only people with the appropriate parking permits were allowed in to the venue and park. Also, as part of the requirements, the permits had to be displayed on the vehicles when parked, otherwise we would have to either call the cops, who were always patrolling, and have the car towed. \n\nThis one faithful day, I was stationed on checkpoint 3, which is where all the cars were parked. Since it was the night shift, I didnt expect any cars to come, so I just walked around, and checked to make sure the cars had their permits. Though our main job was to check permits, we were also required to report any suspicious activity, regardless. As I was making my rounds, I noticed someone sitting in a van. This was strange because no one should have been there. I move in to take a closer look, and make eye contact with the person. I try to be koy, and just move past the van to see what he was looking at. I got pretty close before I saw he was reading anime. In that instant, the guy opens the door and yells at me \" Is there a problem??\". Statled, I said \"no, problem. please continue\". I radioed the situation in to my supervisor, and he said we didnt need to escalate it to the cops since the vehicle had the right permits. I was a bit disappointed since I didnt really like how he was rude to me, but I brushed it off thought that I probably did something wrong myself. \n\nFast forward to the end of the olympics, and we are moving from checkpoint to check point as we help the cops clear out the check points. A few vehicles go by, and I check their permits as required. Close to the end of my shift, I see a familiar looking van, and the head of a guy pop out from the driver's seat. It was the anime guy. Now, his vehicle did have the permit required, but there was nothing in the hand book that said I had to let him pass that instant, so I decided to get a little bit of revenge. \n\nI stare at him as intensely as I could, and walk slowly to his vehicle. As I get closer, I could see his expression change from smiling to anxious. \" Hello there, sir, excellent evening we're having!\" \n\nI could hear his voice filling with anxiety.\n\n\"I hope everything is alright,sir\" he said with his anxious smile\n\nI get to his vehicle\n\n\" I need to see your permit\" I say in a firm voice. The people he was carrying all went quiet.\n\n\" yes, yes, here you are, sir\" his hands were trembling. \n\nI take a moment to look over the permit, flip it over, and look at it again. I could feel the tension building inside the van. \n\nobviously, the permit checked out. But I wanted to push things a bit further. I look towards the cops. I knew they were busy, but I decided to say a firm \"hey\" in their direction. I look back, and the guy is turning white. \n\nI didnt understand why the guy was turning white, as he he had everything in order, but It gave me such satisfaction to see him shit himself in that moment. \n\nI didnt bother calling the cops over, and I told him he could pass, and gave back the permit. As they drove past, I discerned a faint \" holy shit\" and the sounds of heavy breathing. \n\nI dont know in after that moment if what I did was right or wrong, but boy did it feel nice.",

        "text": "I used to work for a charity that helped kids and part of my job was to order in tuck shop supplies for youth groups that we attended in around a 40 mile radius. Now, I didn’t drive at the time so I got around by bus and taking this god awful granny trolley (which I named Jemima because that bitch was fully acquainted with the back of my ankles), full of sweets to and from these places. The drinks I always got delivered to the places because there was no way I was carting them about and Jemima would have no doubt buckled under the pressure. \n\nI was due to go on my dream holiday for 2 weeks so I ordered up on everything so that it would be covered whilst I was away. I ordered the drinks to the venues but somehow one of the orders got mixed up and was delivered to our office space. Luckily (or so I thought), the venue was actually in a town where my boss lived so I asked if he could grab them the next time he came in (he would work 3 days at home and 2 in the office as it was 30 miles away so he would always drive). So I asked if he could help me and basically the answer was a big ol no. My options were to either get them there somehow or find some kind of storage space but not to use the *actual* store cupboard because he didn’t want them filling it up. This is 2 days before my holiday. Where the fuck am I gonna put 67 cases of drinks?! \n\nSo I tossed and turned all night, there was no way I could transport all those drinks 30 miles on a bus. It would take at least 2.5 hours in a round trip which there would need to be multiple of! Not to mention I was sure that Jemima was already plotting my death so filling her with Panda Pop would just make her pull the trigger. \n\nThe day before I left for my holiday I rammed every single one of those bastard drink packages right under my bosses desk in our open office. You could barely get the chair in by the time I had finished and since he was working from home that day, I told everyone it was fine because I was just storing them there for now. By the time my boss got to the office, I was across the sea and had the group chat and his number blocked for the entire holiday.",

Last night my ex (51m) takes our son (8) and every one of his family members out to hibachi and this place also serves sushi (remember that). Well our son absolutely LOVES SUSHI to no end. I started this thing where he has a 'no thank you bite' where if he doesn't want to try something he can use his 'no thank you bite' for anything. Well he never used his 'no thank you bite' for the sushi (little dare devil lol) I had and fell in love lol. Now you also must know that my ex and his family (ie grandmother) NEVER say no to him to ANYTHING it drives me CRAZY (the struggle us real when I put my foot down and the answer is No). Well onto the petty revenge... The restaurant they go to I've been before and it's not cheap by any means. Well talking to my son I casually mention that they serve sushi. \"Really?!!!\" \n\"Mmm hmmm\" and say \"now that you're reading so well just check out the menu\" \nLmao to myself and off he goes excited knowing he can also get Sushi and Hibachi!!! It's like a win win for him!!! Go him!!!\nWell they go out to dinner and he comes home full and ready for bed. I ask about dinner and what he had. Well (I love this) he orders not only a sushi dinner BUT a kids hibachi dinner and that shit was expensive!!! Not only did he get left overs (and was cute enough to say I could have some too I swear this kid kills me) I also got a lovely call from ex asking to teach our son the value of a dollar... Uh what? Sorry I'll be busy that day lol (I will be don't worry). After him leaving us for oxi when our son was a month old you can go f*#% off.

        "text": "My best friend an I rented an apartment together in 2006.  They'd do shit like show up for inspections unannounced, charged us for a bunch of shit that wasn't broken/cleaned/needing repair, holding our deposit for months while they tried to find more things to charge us for post move out, and so on.\n\nWe were both 20-21 at that time.  Working paycheck to paycheck.  Clueless on laws.  We didn't have as much info at our fingertips as today on the internet.  Smart phones weren't even out yet (at least not at an iphone level).  The little \"know it all\" shit that I was... I took shitty cell phone pics with my flip phone.  Documented everything done wrong.  I planned on taking them to court.  I just looked at all the costs etc and just gave up.  Didn't have the time, resources, or spirit to push the issue.\n\nFast forward to 2019.  I have a filing cabinet with stuff going back to 2003.  I pull out the lease agreement from then and see the notes I took on all the ways we got fucked by this property management company.  I re-read it all... the memories come back... as does the rage/anger.  I have the property management company info on the top of the lease.  I grin... fire up google/yelp reviews and look them up.\n\nI find them.  Address matches the document from 2006.  I say \"fuck it lets cook\".  I begin to write a long ass review with date/time stamps, evidence, interactions, and so on.  Talk about how they fucked us out of 1200 dollars basically.  Tell people to avoid doing business with them at all costs.  They private message me saying I have them confused with someone else.  I almost buy it.  Then I verify by calling, getting them to confirm their address, and so on.  I go back and add on the review \"They also told me I had the wrong company and said I may be thinking of company x... they lied to me and almost got another business a bad review.  They private message me again on Yelp.  They threaten legal action and try to fear monger me.  Back then I was making 12/hr.  I make lower 6 figures now.  I'm not worried about legal action and wouldn't mind hiring lawyers to see how it plays out.  I call their bluff.  I say \"That's fine... you screwed me over when I was young, poor, working 12 hr shifts.  I'm no longer poor, working 12 hr shifts, and young/dumb.  I have the time and resources.  I'll await your legal contacts to reach out to mine\".  They back pedal hard core basically replying by begging.  \n\n\"Please please please take down those reviews.  They've been viewed by so many people.  It'll ruin our business.  Please take it down!\".  I reply \"Nope.  See you in court\".  They don't reply.  I leave the reviews up and figure they'll do nothing.  They never did anything.  The HILARIOUS part is my post gave others the courage to post their bad experiences.  Their 4.5 star rating went to 2 stars.  There are at least a dozen posts by others who experienced similar things from the same property management company.  So now they have 2 stars and at least 12 reviews going into length at how their company fucked over tenants.    \n\n\nRevenge is a dish served cold.  I inadvertently played the long game and got triggered after finding old docs from the rental agreement.  Call me Petty Mayo.",

        "text": "Just thought I’d share a story I’ve kept for myself for many years now.\nI’m on phone, so I’m sorry for any mistakes.\n\nSome background info: my parents divorced when I was 8 and my dad got custody of my brother and I (my brother being 5 at the time). Due to my dad not knowing anything about doing any chores like cooking, cleaning and actually looking after his own kids, I then had to take the parental responsibility and did all the chores, even staying home from school if my brother was sick.\n\nAbout when I was 13-14, my dad started seeing this woman that he soon married and shortly after we moved from the apartment to a house, I hoped it would give me less chores so that I better could focus on school, but things just got worse.\n\nI got the smallest room with no heat in the house, meanwhile my brother got the largest room.\nMy dad and stepmom would treat him like the golden child and give him everything he wanted (big TV, computer, PlayStation and so on and this did have consequences later on).\nMeanwhile I barely got anything and still had to do all the chores to the point where I would be cleaning the entire house, mow the lawn, walk the dogs, cook dinner almost every day (I even had to pay for their food with my own money).\nThere was no end to the chores, make tea for them, make sure the fireplace didn’t go out, trim the hedges and take care of the garden (which my stepmom was supposed to take care of) they would always come up with excuses for me to do it.\n\nAt one point I would even have bruises from my stepmom hitting me because I didn’t do as she asked, then she would whine to my dad and tell him I was violent against her.\n(And yes, he always believed her)\n\nI could go on, but this is already getting long.\nLong story short, I was the black sheep for being the gay son, who was nothing but a disappointment for some reason.\n\nTo the revenge:\nIt was in the middle of winter, so it was pretty cold outside and the house had some issues with heating properly.\nMy dad, brother and stepmom was leaving for the day (can’t remember why) which meant once I was done with a few chores, I would have a break for me to actually relax.\nI had just fired up in the fireplace, while my stepmom is running back and forth, basically like a headless chicken (normal behaviour for her). All while leaving the front door wide open.\n\nMe: stepmom, would you please shut the front door?\n\nStepmom: what?\n\nMe: I said, would you please shut the front door, you’re letting out the heat and you know my room is right next to the door. I’m already struggling with having some form of heat in there.\n\nStepmom: stop your whining, be grateful that you have a room. A little fresh air won’t hurt you!\nAnd you better be done with the laundry and cleaning before I get home!\n\nAnd with that she left.\nThis was normal behaviour from her, but this time I was just seeing red.\n\nI went into the kitchen and looked around and soon went for the spices.\nEvery morning, my stepmom has oatmeal for breakfast. I thought she might enjoy a little extra flavour, so I dumped a ton of salt into the oatmeal.\nDried chilli flakes into her tea (she hates spicy things) and on it went like this.\n\nThe next morning I woke up to the sound of my stepmom spitting and coughing “it feels like I swallowed a spoonful of salt!”\nI was pretty happy with her response and the next following days was a minefield for her and she somehow never figured out that I was behind it.\n\nAn added bonus was how it ended up revealing both my dad and stepmom as the entitled people they are.\n\nI know it isn’t anything big.\nI have some close friends and family who tells me I should have gone bigger on the revenge.\nBut I’m 32 now and moved out ages ago. I purposefully have minimum contact with my dad and stepmom.\n\nTLDR: stepmom treated me like shit, so I spiced up her food and created a minefield of spices.",

Clocking in up to 10 minutes late wasn't really an ordeal, as long as you showed up ready to go. \n\nI came outside at 445 to find that a local police officer has pulled someone over and is now blocking my driveway. \n\nThis has happened before, but normally in the afternoon, and normally I just ask the officer to move forwards or back a couple of feet and then I pull in or out of the driveway. No sweat. \n\nThis officer, however, angrily informs me that I will have to wait till he's done. I snap a picture of his car, text it to my manager and explain my tardiness. \n\n40 minutes later, the police officer FINALLY moves. I scramble into the car and head to work. I get there 15 minutes before we open. I frantically start to brew tea, fetch ice, having to condense my 50 minute routine into 15. I almost forgot to brew coffee. \n\nOpening time rolls around, and the first group of customers come in. It's a group of our local police officers, led by the captain.  I guess they're about to do a shift change.  One of the officers in the group is the one who blocked my driveway. \n\nAnyway, the Captain orders coffee, and I regretfully inform him that there's a five minute wait on coffee because I got to work extremely late. Captain asks why, so I pulled out my phone and explained that one of his officers blocked my driveway for 45 minutes for a routine traffic stop. \n\nCaptain proceeds to chew out that officer in front of all of his colleagues and exclaims that nothing short of a life or death emergency should block my driveway if it will interfere with him getting his morning coffee. \n\nIt was never blocked again. And the Captain always got his coffee at 6am, without interruption.",

I think it’s pretty funny so here you go!\n\nI love reminiscing with my mom on her younger days, and this story is one of my favorites.\n\nMy moms childhood best friends mother had gotten a new boyfriend… an abusive one. He was definitely verbally abusive, but not physically until the day before my mom had decided to visit. My mom walked through the door and seen her best friend had a black eye. This grown man PUNCHED this 14 year old girl in the face! The mother didn’t leave him unfortunately. My mom being a very mean and spiteful kid wasn’t letting this man get away with  what he had did.\n\nThey both knew they couldn’t physically fight back as revenge, so my mom did the next best thing she could think of. My mother cooked this man dinner, tacos actually. She then took the refried beans to the bathroom and shit a period shit in them(she couldn’t leave out the period detail either- ladies, iykyk). She then mixed it all together, put some on his tacos and served him dinner.\n\nHe got really sick for a few days. Puking, lethargic and actually concerning symptoms. The mother ended up leaving after further abusive. My mom is still very proud of this one! Hope you enjoyed :)",

        "text": "Background: I have a giant black walnut tree in my back yard. It's actually my neighbors, but I get the brunt of the walnuts. And anyone who has a black walnut tree knows what kind of hell that means every fall when the walnuts drop. My town won't take the walnuts (they pick up sticks and stuff at the curb) but they say the garbage company is required to. \n\nStory: one fall the walnuts are dropping and it was an exceptional year for them. There were an astonishing amount. So I go out there and take them all into piles, load the into garbage bags, put the bags on my little trailer, and drop them by the curb for the garbage company. It's the two day dance I have to do to mow my lawn in the fall. The garbage comes by and leaves them there. Wtf! I call the garbage company \n\nSide note: I was in a very bad place. My grandma was dying and my ex and I were on the outs.\n\nThe conversation got pretty heated, words were said from both sides, the owner was going to be coming out. Great! She comes out telling me about how mean I was I the phone so I inform her of the terrible things her employee also said. Then tell me about how they left the bags because they're too heavy. There's 40 billion walnuts divided between a dozen bags. Admittedly they're heavy but not too bad. I was able to pick them up easily. She then went back into what an asshole I am for a while. Then returned to how they need to be lighter and she'll take them.\n\nKey the pettiness: after she left I went into the house and got every plastic grocery bag I could find. I learned to hoard those golden bags from the best so I had a lot. I took every last one outside and put a single walnut in each bag. There weren't enough for all 40 billion walnuts, but I made sure to rip open each bag to take some from them to lighten them all. made a big pile at the curb and called the company and let them know they had been put into smaller bags. Owner is going to come back out. Great! I see her pull up, grab one bag with a walnut in it, and look at my house. So I walk out there with a smile on my face and go \"you wanted the bags lighter, enjoy.\" And started to walk back toward the house. As I was leaving I hear her go \"so this is what we're doing now? Should I also grab your garbage bin too?\" To which I responded \"don't give a shit, it's your company. Do what you want after you take the walnuts like the town requires you to.\" And proceeded to go back inside. \n\nSecond side note: they didn't take my garbage bin. I never had to deal with the that wretched lady on the phone again, but did have a great relationship with the company after. I had to call them about a few things since and never had any further issues.",

Thing is I have reason to believe, that someone is trying to either Steal my car, otherwise get me for my CAT. Because I am the one people tend to take advantage of the most because I am a friendly guy who is also mean and an asshole when I feel something has to be said. anyone have any clever ways I can prevent either from happening? Now mind you that I live in a home with about 7 other roommates and I have reason to beleive that this is an inside job, for the reasons that when I've set up a wifi security cam it's funny that when \"vandalism\" or other roommates cars are broken into, even one stolen a few weeks back, the wifi in the home suddenly mysteriously disconnects from server or host, yet supposedly only \"one person has access to the internet in the home\" including past roommates who no longer reside in the home.  On top of that i am the less fortunate one who does not get a parking spot in the Garage or car ports/driveway. So thats no option for me. Ive removed the fuel pump relay also the Intake Air Temp sensor I'm also feeling that the culprit caught on, judging by the fact that there's a car the same exact as mines that has been creeping/speeding by with the head lights off continuously for several nights that have past while I've sat in my car working on other faults or OBD codes that are popping up differently almost every day. I mean I'm pretty close to airing out all my tires completely just so theres just a little less space to get to the CAT however I know some people are risky enough to actually jack up a car and take all rims off just to leave it sitting on bricks and no one actually notices till the very next day. Anyone give any suggestions at all so that I don't sound like the paranoid neighbor asking for 911 dispatch to send a car to watch every night and get laughed at?",

Often times they were funny pranks other times they crossed a line. \n\nI happened to be the target of one of his pranks. He had put red penetration dye in my gloves the day before so they were dry the following day. I put on my welding gloves and as the day went on my hands got sweaty and eventually turned my hands pretty red. It stayed like that for days and while Ray denied having done it, he definitely acted like he was the responsible party. And to be totally fair I had no proof he had done it but the probability was extremely high that he had. \n\nMy BIL at the time was in to making home made fireworks, so I asked if he could make me a smoke bomb. This kid brings me back a film canister with a fuse. \n\nNext day at work I wait until after lunch when Ray and his crew are climbing in to the tank they were working on. Yes this was a confined space, but they all had fresh air supplies, I wouldn’t have done this otherwise. I lit the fuse tossed it in the tank and walked down to my area and turned around to see all the guys scrambling out of their tank and the whole end of the bay filling up with a thick cloud of smoke. I knew I fucked up so I ducked in to my tank in hopes I was not suspected of the prank. \n\nA few minutes later I hear the super yelling my name to get the fuck out of the tank. He tosses the remnants of the film case and asks if I knew anything about it. At this point I figured honesty was the best policy as I’m sure someone probably witnessed it and told him it was me. I tell him it’s a smoke bomb and he asks if I set it off, I admit that I did and he tells me to pack my shit up and get out. \n\nOn my way home I’m sitting there freaking out how I’m going to tell my wife who’s sitting at home with our toddler how I just got fired and kicking myself for not thinking shit through.  My phone rings and it’s the superintendent, he tells me to come to work in three days that he’s turning it into a suspension. \n\nI got back and he told me the reason he was so pissed is because a multimillion dollar contract had been touring the shop and fortunately had not been anywhere near the smoke bomb. When he told the owner what had happened he laughed and told him to give me another shot. \n\nDefinitely learned my lesson. It was probably the last prank I pulled. But at least it’s something I can look back on now and laugh about it.",

        "text": "I (20 F) live in student housing where I share a room, and in the other room are two other girls who we’ll call Sasha (22 F) and Summer (21 F). I share a room with one we’ll call Bee (19 F). At first Bee wasn’t an issue and we all got along just fine; we were all friends and would go on fun adventures together, but the issues arose when she brought her boyfriend to live with us. At first she said he was visiting for the weekend, but somehow he never left. He’d leave for work and come right back and she expected us to sneak him into student housing after hours for her because Sasha and I had cars we could hide him in and drive him past security. This made us extremely uncomfortable, because if we got caught we could get academic probation and whatnot but the kicker was that she seemed to be aware of all the housing rules and regulations around what she was doing. Later on, she started cat sitting for her boyfriend as well… or so that’s what we thought. The cat would go to the boyfriend’s house from time to time but for the most part she kept it at the dorm but as we could all guess even more problems started to come out of it. She claimed it was an ESA registered through student housing, so we couldn’t get in trouble for her bringing her “boyfriend’s cat” over. Since none of us really knew the process for that we assumed it was fine and minded our business until one day the RA caught wind of it, but because Summer, Sasha and I are friends with him, he let it slide because we were all under the impression it would only be there temporarily. Once again it never left, and she never cleaned up after it, making the apartment reek of cat shit, it destroyed the carpet and when anyone scolded it, she lost her shit because she read online that you’re not supposed to say no to your cat if you want it to love you or some dumb bs like that. Anyway, naturally we were all tired of her shit, so Summer asked the RA for advice, where we found out there was no way this cat was documented through housing meaning she broke the lease and we could get in trouble for the damages and it let alone being there. He said the cat had to be a minimum of 2 years old, fixed, and up to date with vaccines to be able to stay, which it had none of. We confront her kindly, and she turns it into a soap opera scene with screaming and crying (which has been a pattern throughout all of this). She left messes everywhere and when we asked her to tidy up after herself and respect others common room items she took personal offense to it, etc. Our last straw was when she brought an ant infestation into the dorm bc she left basically all of her pantry items open. When we called her to let her know we were tossing it all she got mad and said she’d be over in a few (which to her I guess a few means three hours when she was literally 20 mins away at her parents house). We had a few friends come up and keep us company while we cleaned and when she got there it was immediate crying and yelling about how we only blamed her because she’s the youngest. Quite frankly we were all sick of her and sick of the fact that she was downright unapproachable, so we set up a mediation with our RA which got changed to the Community Director due to the bias we had by being friends with the RA. Well that didn’t do shit because she went and had her own meeting where she told a whole so story and said that we tried to poison her with raid and that the RA gave her permission to have the cat (which he didn’t) in attempts to get him in trouble. So, collectively we all decided on petty revenge after she moved back with her parents. We had my mom send a text on Facebook as a concerned parent to both of her strict parents of everything she did wrong and asked them to consider having a “talk” with her so she could see how dangerous it is to have a strange man living with a bunch of girls far from home with nowhere else to go for safety in the event that he try to do something. Since doing this, she has not been active on any social media, which she normally eats, sleeps, and breathes on, and has left any and every group chat we had as roommates or with any mutual friends. I know what I did was petty and childish but the three of us needed closure after the shit show we lived through this semester, and I hope her parents rip her a fucking new one for what she pulled.",

        "text": "This truly is the pettiest thing I’ve ever done. \n\nMy apartment building has several washers and dryers for the tenants to use. Sadly, management is pretty terrible and has let a lot of these appliances break down and are slow to make repairs. This leaves us with several washers and three functioning dryers for the whole building.\n\nYesterday was a cleaning day. I had started two loads of clothes in the morning but come time to put them in the dryer, the only operable ones were taken. I figured, no big deal, I’d come back down a little later and swap it over then.\n\nI set an alarm on my phone and went down there a few minutes early and waited for another tenant to unload their clothes so I could get one of my loads into a dryer. I realized this was the only dryer I’d be able to use and I’d have to wait for this dryer to end and so I could put my second load into that dryer when this one wraps up. Pain in the ass but it is what it is.\n\nWell, I come back down to the laundry room as that dryer is wrapping up to swap the loads of laundry over and come in to another person putting their stuff into the dryer I was using who then boogied out as fast as possible. It took me a minute to register but she had removed my clothes before they finished and put her own clothes in so she could start using that dryer.\n\nI get it that it’s frustrating that none of the dryers have been open but to remove my clothes before the end of the cycle rubbed me the wrong way. Especially considering she saw me come in and didn’t even say anything like “hey sorry I had to move your clothes I’m in a rush.” Nothing. Now I’d have to wait another hour for the next dryer to open up to dry the second load of laundry. I had literally been waiting hours for that dryer and came down early so I wouldn’t be taking up anyone’s time, yet that obviously wasn’t enough.\n\nI know this makes me a dick but I was so pissed off. I opened her dryer door and closed it again without pushing the start button. Her clothes sat wet for the next 90 minutes. When I came back to collect my second load later on her clothes were gone.",

        "text": "In high school, so this was about 2005-2006 mind you (wow dating myself.) I worked at a rather larger pizza chain you’ve undoubtedly heard of. I’m a people person by nature and like to work the dining room, make conversations with guests, etc. \n\nHowever, my managers were insistent that I work phones instead. The job was essentially answer the phone, use a terrible, terrible UI on a computer to select pizzas configurations such as crust, toppings, cheese etc. \n\nOn a daily basis, often multiple times a shift, people would call in to place an order over the phone and would add several pizzas not bothering to check the total until the very end. Suddenly, a $100 order for chain pizza sounds absolutely ridiculous and they’d want to modify or cancel orders. Our UI was absolute dog shit and any cancellations or modifications required manager approval. \n\nI often tried to reiterate what the total was at any point in time and make call outs like adding chicken is an extra $5. But despite my efforts, obnoxious customers wouldn’t engage with the data that I was providing until the very end .\n\nMy managers were pretty un-empathic that this was slowing me down and that customers were squarely to blame for my decreased efficiency. So I devised a system to keep tabs on customers to give myself a heads up if an asshole was calling in.\n\nAs a joke one day my managers poured a pretty hefty amount of salt into my coke while I was preoccupied and took a sip right as I answered the phone, gagging for a moment. They also started calling me Mitch Bade (from a Tech9 song). Oh so funny guys. So no love lost there mind you.\n\nCustomer data has three name fields, first middle and last but nobody used middle probably because it seemed overly intrusive. So for whatever reason, if you were an asshole I labeled your middle name as “BLAARG”. \n\nNow this went on for several weeks without incident. But it became apparent that our customers were primarily of the asshole variety. So one day it seemed that one in every three customers showed up in our store directory as “John BLAARG Smith” (insert first and last with whatever.)\n\nI hadn’t realized at the time that these were the seeds of anarchy and that I was water, earth and sunshine. \n\nOur delivery drivers were so fucking high all the time that they saw BLAARG in all caps that they assumed the orders were related. Not one or two but dozens of pizzas were delivered to the wrong homes every night. We were refunding everything. Customers would call in and ask completely indignant, “why is my middle name BLAARG? My name isn’t BLAARG!” \n\nAnd I gaslit the fuck out of them. “BLAARG? How do you spell that? Is that a family name?” And “I’m so sorry but someone must have misunderstood your middle name over the phone. Is it Blare or Blake by chance?” \n\ncustomers, drivers and managers were all furious. Drivers couldn’t bother to read and managers refused to put me in the dining room where I stood to make tips. So I massacred their productivity metrics with a single word. \n\nThey could never prove it was me. But I ended up getting fired for some nonsense like not exuding pizza core values. It was 5.25/hr so it was marginally better than not working at all as a high schooler.",

We were getting a stipend for it, and it was generally assumed that one or more of us may be selected for an extension of the project, and, more importantly, of the stipend. Very important for broke college students. \n\nWe worked for the duration, and by the end, we had each been scheduled for an appraisal meeting with the lead, in which we would most likely get the news on whether we had been selected for the extension or not.\n\nEnter obnoxious fellow student, let's call him A. A was one of those people who felt everything in life was a contest, that he had to win. He always hid his work from the rest of us, as if we were going to copy it off him or something (we all worked on different topics, there wasn't really a need for that much privacy). When we discussed the work we were doing on breaks, he always brushed is off with obviously-fake excuses like \"oh I'm just doing data entry, that's it\", or \"I didn't do anything today, I was just gaming on my phone\".\n\nNow, the rest of us knew that not all of us would get the extension, but we just did our work and were friendly to each other. If we got it, great! If we didn't, well, that's alright, and good for anyone who did! But A was determined to get in, and how he went about it was to fake that he was slacking off so we'd see him as less of a threat, and actually work super hard and swipe the extension out from under us. Why? No clue. He was just that sort of person, I guess. I don't think any of us would have been envious if he _had_ got the thing from noticeable hard work like everyone else, but he seemed to think this was a better way to do it. \n\nAnyway, back to the end. A couple of people were scheduled before A, and as they came out of their appraisals they passed my seat, and I asked them how it had gone. When A's turn came, I caught his eye as he passed, and he shook his head and quickly ran to his seat. I followed, thinking tgat maybe he was upset at something? He saw me coming and hissed, \"No, don't come here! The lead said I'm not supposed to discuss it with anyone!\"\n\nI was pretty surprised by this, especially since none of the others had ever mentioned that after _their_ reviews. Later on, everyone met up and discussed the reviews that had completed till then, and he was very secretive and didn't reveal anything. Again, unlike everyone else.\n\nThe next day I had my review scheduled, and as I expected, there was no mention of not discussing the reviews with anyone else. Afterwards, I got back to my seat and started explaining how it had gone to another student. Suddenly I saw A making a very determined beeline right for me. He practically ran over, and asked, \"How did it go? Did you get the extension?\"\n\nI just shook my head conspiratorially and said, \"Sorry, but you probably shouldn't ask me about it. The lead said I'm not supposed to discuss it with anyone at all.\"\n\nThen I just went on to begin discussing it quietly with the other student while A's smug smile dripped off his face.",

My dad would call my mom and he would repeatedly ask her to call him, eventually she did. First thing he said to her after hello, was “what do you want?”. She hung up on him. \n\nAnd she was MAD. I don’t mean angry, I mean nuclear powered mad. She moved, and changed her phone number. She told none of their friends where she moved to, and she didn’t give any of them her phone number. She also changed the shifts she worked; I think she went from working days to working the evening shift. She made herself really hard to find.\n\nSo my dad, after having letters returned and with a dead telephone number, was unable to find her, quit his job at the logging camp, flew to Vancouver, and sat in the BC Tel lobby for 4 days waiting for her to show up for her shift. It took four days because she had days off. One afternoon she showed up.\n\nNow he was mad. After the yelling fight in the BC Tel lobby, he took her purse and her keys, leaving her enough money for lunch. He came back when her shift was over. They obviously made up, cause I was born. \n\nMoral of the story, don’t piss off my mom.",

Usually I could massage it out but it wasn’t working so I visited an ortho doc to get evaluated for a possible carpal tunnel release procedure.\n\nThis doc was pretty good, easy to deal with and no nonsense. His medical assistant must have thought she was Hippocrates. My first appointment is to get established, of course. This MA was snarky straight out of the gate, saying stuff like “I don’t think you’ll qualify for surgery. Just because your hand won’t close doesn’t mean you have nerve compression.”\n\nIn order to qualify for anything, I had to have testing done, take a nerve medicine to see if it would relieve the symptoms, and then go back. When I return after jumping through the insurance company’s hoops, the MA asked if the nerve medicine was working. I told her that it helped a little bit and she asked me why I came back if the medicine helped it. I told her “Well I’m right handed and I still can’t fully use my right hand.”\n\nIn the end, I got the procedure done and it helped tremendously. After a week or so post op, I had to go back to the office to have stitches removed and the MA asked to confirm what I was there for that day. I told her and she asked if Dr. said it was time. I replied that they scheduled the appointment for that reason so I assumed so. She left the room and came back with the suture removal equipment and got it done. I *knew* the doc hadn’t given the all clear but I was sick of dealing with her holier than thou attitude about working in a doctors office. I also knew it was ready to have the suture removed anyway. I could have stopped her but I didn’t. \n\nAs she finishes up, the doc comes in and says very coolly and matter-of-factly “I didn’t give the go ahead yet.” The color literally drained from her face as he told her to leave the room and wait for him in the hallway.\n\nShe glanced at me as she walked out and I just smiled at her.

My mom told me once that I wasn’t as bad as he was when I was four and had my tonsils out. The term man cold was invented for my dad. Mom was a woman who eventually would get her revenge. My dad was a lineman who built towers to carry high transmission power lines, so he wasn’t home every night, usually every weekend. So, when he came home in the middle of the week, my mom knew she was in for a rough time with him, so she decided to kill him with kindness. It was spring and it was nice and warm out, but that was dangerous when you have a cold, she cranked up the heat (she liked it warm) and kept all the windows shut. He was placed on the couch so she could keep an eye on him. She made him wear his woollen long underwear, and made mustard plaster to rub on his chest, and of course he had to be under a blanket. He was also forced to wear a scarf, there might have been a hat too, cause drafts are dangerous you know. She made him drink hot rum toddys to fight the cold. I think she kept this up for three days, I do remember him saying he was too hot and could he change out of his long underwear  or get out from under the blanket but she didn’t let him.  I think it was day 4 that he got up and announced that he was all better. For many years after, whenever he coughed or sneezed, or his voice sounded rough, she would say I think you’re getting a cold, he would deny it and get out of the house as quickly as possible. He never was sick again (at least not that he admitted). Good job mom.",

The fact that her clothes were already placed in the machines (+ the timers on the other two)and running tells me she had to know that my timer just finished.   So I stayed down there to supervise the dryers, because I didn’t want her to touch my clothes again in case I needed to add extra dry time. She came down right before my dry time ended and I saw her use a Clorox wipe on the folding table she had previously placed my clean clothes on. She put her wet clothes into the one dryer that was available, and seemed to be waiting around for me to empty my dryers. As soon as the dry time ended I did a check and although my clothes were dry enough to take out, I wanted to inconvenience her. I closed the doors and added an extra 45 mins to both dryers. She went upstairs after seeing this, leaving her wet clothes in the washers. I then took my clothes out and left the dryers to complete the cycle on low. When they’re finished it displays the message “open door”, so she’s going to think that I didn’t remove the clothes yet. She’s either going to wait for me to come down, or open them and realize what I did. For reference, there are three ways back into the building- the exit only shortcut to the front of the building/sidewalk, the long way around through the backyard/parking lot and the elevator (which is out of order). I took the “exit only” shortcut and noticed that she stuffed tissue paper into the lock, so that she didn’t have to take the long way when she came back down. I removed the paper to lock her out and placed it on the stairs so she could see it.",

A co worker/friend of mine lives close by and Karen has called the police or whoever on his dog many times. There have even been a few fines handed out, for things like \"dog at large\"\n\nSo sometimes you choose a plan and sometimes a plan chooses you. In mid October I was shopping with my brain firmly in low power mode. And I see the shelf of warning signs, including \"beware of large dog\" The word large caught my eye and got my brain moving. Thoughts like, \"if I put this up can I fool her?\" and \"If I do this will I be a Nabor hood hero?\" In the end I decided not all heroes wear capes and put up the signs in front of my house.\n\nIt took a few days for me to see Karen looking at my signs and then start staring at my house. Or at least it took me a while to see her kinda stalking my home. Some days she is kinda subtle and some say she kinda does a wander thing where she is pretty much pacing the area.\n\nAbout 3 weeks after putting up the signs I was shopping at my local Good Will, because I am classy like that. And I saw a 3 foot dog chain for $2. I was hatching my plan before I even had it in my hand. So there was a chain but no collar and clearly I needed a big big collar. I couldn't find a big collar but i DID FIND A WOMAN'S BELT. Its thick with square studs on it so it kinda looks like a collar for a large dog or maybe a small horse. I hope no one saw me on my drive home, I had the most evil smile on my face, the whole time.\n\nSo the collar and chain are hung by the door for when I would need them. My girl friend has been rolling her eyes at me through all of this, but she has put up with weirder things from me so she is fine.\n\nSo after 4 days on the hook, I see Karen down the street, I race for the door and grab the collar with the manic glee of child at Christmas. When Karen walks by she see me holding this monster collar, yelling Baskerville!!! Baskerville, come here boy. Followed by lots of whistling and wandering around looking behind my car things like that.\n\nKaren sees this and her eye's go wide, with pure but silent terror. I started to smile so I used my hands to cup over my mouth and kept calling for Baskerville and walked behind my house. I was holding in my laughter so hard I may have gotten a hernia but if I did it was worth it.\n\nI have done this same thing 5 times in the last few weeks. And it is still as fun as the first time. I am pretty sure I have wasted 14 afternoons of this woman's life. She has spent so much time trying to catch my beloved Baskerville at something she can call the cops on. So far no one has come to my house like a cop or whatever. And I am pretty sure Karen has caught on to what I am doing. But I only spent $20 on the signs and collar/belt. So I feel like I got my money's worth.",

My seat was an empty lidded 5 gallon bucket and everyday as I was getting ready to sit one coworker would kick it across the room before I had a chance to sit down. Everyone found it hilarious. It was funny the first couple times but it got old. \n\nSo one day I thought it would be hilarious to cut the bottom of the bucket off and then fill it with nuts and bolts and put the lid back on. \n\nThat day at lunch we go in he tries to kick the bucket, of course it goes nowhere and he angrily picks it up and tosses the bucket across the room. And of course as he picks the bucket up all the nuts and bolts go spilling out of the bottom. It was hilarious and everyone in the hut was laughing. I had brought in a camping chair pulled it out and sat down and said, “Damn man looks like you have a mess clean up!”",

I spoke with four agents, they all told me that I had downgraded my plan. I did not do this, and it took asking them multiple multiple times before they admitted that it was on their end. I asked for a refund, nope, against their policy, I can continue using the service for the remainder of the month.  \n\n\nSo what am I doing? Setting my work laptops to stream random shows 24/7 for the remainder of my subscription (they're on all day anyway, I work from home and need them on). I know it's not going to hurt their bottom line, but it makes me feel just a little bit better!",

        "text": "I live in a apartment building with my 2 friends. The building we live in have mainly wooden work (floors , walls etc) and the floor of our apartment and the ceiling of the downstairs apartment doesn't have much gap in between. The downstairs residents are 2 girls who we don't know personally. \nSo what happened is that one day we came back from college and found 4 big screws coming out of the floor and saw dust in the middle of the living room . \nWe thought the girls must have done some ceiling work and we shouldask them to fix it or it might seriouslyhut us. \nWe went down to tell them what had happened and as they opened the door we got surprised to see a stripping pole in the middle of their living room(Yes a stripping pole). We told them the screws for stripping pole are pointing in our room so please remove them. They said they'll get it done tomorrow as its evening now and we agreed . We put on a thick towel on the screws so that we dont hurt ourselves. Next evening the screws we still there and we could see the screws move slightly as we think they were dancing or practicing on the pole. We confronted them again and they said they forgot and they'll get it done tomorrow. Weeks went by but they didn't get it done and as they used it frequently the screw holes were getting bigger as they moved around so much. \nWe got fed up of them and decided to do something , we are electrical engineering students so we decided to do something in our style.\n\n One afternoon we came back early and hooked up our bike battery to the screws and waited. As the screws holes were big enough we could hear what was happening under if we were silent. We heard the music and we turned the switch on , as she jumped to climb the pole she got shocked ( NOTE : dont worry the current was not strong enough to harm her , it just zapped her . We made a fully circuit with meter and switch and we controlled how much current was passing) . We heard a scream and we giggled and turned it off , she was telling the other girl that she felt a shock and the other girl touched it and felt nothing and said they it might me the static electricity so the other girl started again and we zapped her again. We kept on doing that until they came up to ask if we did something.  We told them that we think the screws are touching some wires in your ceiling as the holes are getting bigger as the screws moves around so much and advised them to get it removed or it may cause some short circuitand cause fire . Same evening they got it removed.\nSorry I know the last part feels rushed but the post was getting to long , its my first time posting . Hope you'll understand",

Its fine i didnt care, but what bothered me was when she kept saying \"ill do it, ill do it\", she even went as far as lying about sending me something. So for her birthday months later I just messaged her a happy birthday and didnt send her shit. She didn't ask about any packages but if she did would of just told her I was broke because that shit is expensive to mail.",
