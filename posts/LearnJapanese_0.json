        "text": "it looks like the jury's still out on talking to chat gpt in english and asking it for translations and grammar questions, but I've tried talking to bing chat in japanese about a sentence in the fate stay night vn that I didn't understand fully. Since bing chat can actually use the internet it pulls up type moon wikis to justify it's interpretation of the sentence, in addition to having a better understanding of japanese than me. I think this might be really helpful, and better than pulling up the english translation when I'm lost.\n\nQuestion:\n「アーチャーを召喚した事で、右手に刻まれた紋様。これが令呪。聖杯によってもたらされた聖痕が、サーヴァントを召喚する事によって変化したマスターの証である。」 この文を説明ください。特に、「変化」よく分からない。マスターが変化したの？\n\nResponse:\nこの文は、『Fate/stay night』というゲームやアニメの世界観に関するものです。令呪とは、聖杯戦争という魔術師同士の戦いに参加するために必要な、サーヴァントという英霊を召喚・支配する力を持つ紋様です12。聖杯戦争に参加する魔術師はマスターと呼ばれます。\n\n「変化」という言葉は、令呪がサーヴァントを召喚する前と後で形が違うことを表しています1。マスター自身が変化したわけではありません。令呪の形は人によって異なります3。\n\nQuestion:\nその「聖痕」の振り仮名は「よちょう」です。その「よちょう」を漢字で書けば「予兆」ですか？\n\nResponse:\n「聖痕」の振り仮名は「せいこん」です。この言葉は、キリストの受難においてついた傷や、その傷と同じ場所に信者の体に現れるとされる傷を指します12。漢字で書くと「聖痕」となります。「予兆」という漢字は関係ありません。\n\nQuestion:\n普通はそうですけど、実際このゲームによちょうという振り仮名があります。その意味が説明してほしい\n\nResponse:\nこのゲームでは、聖痕とは令呪のことを指します。令呪は聖杯戦争に参加する魔術師に与えられる、サーヴァントを召喚・支配する力を持つ紋様です。よちょうという振り仮名は、聖痕が聖杯戦争の始まりを告げる予兆であることを表しています。",

At first I began my quest of translating song lyrics in hopes of expanding my vocabulary, that however, does not work when I can’t understand the sentence itself. So, I took on a different approach, Ill open up a drawing app, copy and paste the sentence, then underline each part of the sentence and how its functioning (ex. If theres a noun ill underline it with the translation at the bottom and noun at the top) does this actually help me with anything, or am I just wasting my time? I’m not very sure, I do all the standard stuff (textbooks, flashcards) but I wanted to branch out and try practicing in different ways, all help is appreciated!! \n\n(I know basic sentence structure but interactive with native content makes my brain explode)",

I still have all of my notes from that semester, so I can still review those, but when it comes to continuing and learning more kanji and more sentences and talking, how should I best proceed? Should I use an app like Duolingo or LingoDeer? I graduated, so I obviously just can't take the 102 course. Any advice would be appreciated!",

What kind of practicing techniques are unusually recommended when trying get better at hearing?\n\nI watched some videos from \"Comprehensible Japanese\" and noticed I don't have much of an issue there, but when I branch out into N3 content via videos, podcasts, or even my JLPT/Kanzen and Tobira audio portions the speed and my ability to figure out what is happening drops to almost zero.\n\nI noticed a few things stopping me when I try to focus. If I miss a word, hear numbers, or didn't catch a phrase the entire rest of the sentence becomes a blur. If I miss what happens, I wait for a break and try to continue with the content and see if I can continue. Closing my eyes helps a little bit since sometimes I can picture in my head what's being said, but it's dependent on if I understand what's going on. \n\nMy biggest issue seems to be that I get easily distracted when listening (hence why I try to close my eyes). I'll try to really pay attention and then see a car drive by outside the window and totally miss what just was said. However even if I close my eyes, lay down, and really pay attention I'll occasionally get a random thought in English that takes away my attention. I noticed if I listen along while I have a transcript available it becomes easier, but then I'm just filling in the blanks with the words I'm reading.\n\nSo any advice for learners who were able to improve listening comprehension?",

I want to start learning enough Japanese be less of an ignorant foreigner than the run of the mil ignorant foreigner. Basics like hello please thanks sorry etc. and travel related stuff like left right trains, how much, numbers, ordering and the like. Not so much ‘kore wa watashi no neko desu Ka’ which is what my apps going on about - Jasmin is staying at home. I think YouTube and effort will be good for most, but does anyone who’s learnt for a trip have any advice on what else is worth learning, and where they learned it from?",

        "text": "Hello there!\n\nOver the past years I always tried to learn here and there a bit Japanese, but for several reasons I really stopped quite early without any major progress. However, this year everything is different, I am totally serious and very motivated. It is fun guys! Basically I am doing a combination between my language course I visit on a weekly basis and some self-study. But I have to admit, I suck, I am a slow learner ... so I am looking for ways to improve my learning habits. \n\nAs in the post header implied: I am looking for ways to make the kana really stick and practice reading them.\n\nI agree with people who say \"Kana\" is easy, you can learn them within a few hours. I was one of those people who did it and then felt like I achieved something, which is completely ridiculous. I recognise all of them, but reading a word or a sentence, I am so slow ... it feels bad. What helps me is learning vocabulary with Kana only, I feel like this a good habit to make it stick.  But somehow I am not happy with that, I need something else aside from vocabulary to make them stick. I feel like being able to read Kana really fluently going to be a major step forward. But how do I manage this? I need to achieve this before moving on into Kanji.\n\nAre there any Games / Books / Mangas you would recommend? Even if I don't know all the vocabulary, I think it would be fun doing something interesting and then like a puzzle figuring out all the words and understanding what is actually going on.\n\nThank you!",

I have been slowly but surely learning Japanese for the past month to month and a half, and I have gotten to the point where I can kind of grasp the concept of verbs and their suffixes ( 一段 and  五段verbs, how changing the ending of a verb can make it negative or past tense for example); however, I feel like I am missing something.\n\n I watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhyrskGBKHE) (a little unsettling, but the info was great) last night after browsing this sub to get a better grasp of how verbs and verb \"conjugations\" work, and it makes sense on paper, but applying it has proven to be a little bit of a challenge. I just find myself struggling to find what verb ending to use when, as there seem to be quite a few variations of each. I have found [this chart](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/AMB_Japanese_Verbs.pdf/page1-1200px-AMB_Japanese_Verbs.pdf.jpg) that honest to goodness seems like quite a powerful resource, but I'm finding it difficult to really put it to use with my studying and understand the entirety of what's going on.\n\nI have been working through Genki I mainly and supplementing other resources when I need to grasp a concept a little better. I feel like I'm right on the edge of that \"aha!\" moment where this concept makes sense, and it just starts coming to me quite easily, but I feel like it needs just a little bit more reinforcing. I'm hoping I could possibly get a little assistance from you all with that. \n\nI know that this post is quite open-ended and not a super specific question, but I hope that I was able to get my point across. Any advice or assistance would be great. Thank you!",

        "text": "I have been told by a Japanese teacher from Kyoto that I remind her of the dialect spoken at her home town (they lived near Fushimi Inari Taisha), but I am not sure when I compare it in wikipedia.\n\nHere's main things that make me doubt or wonder if I could have lived in Kyoto/speaking/dialect wise:\n\n• I don't know much about shortenning words which I do see in western dialects it's supposed to be a thing, I only remember words being shortened for things like すげえ /suɡeː/ or maybe little exceptions. Generally I get told I say things in a long way instead. Teachers tell me things like \"we don't say that anymore, we abbreviate it now\"\n\n• The way I remember Japanese spoken uses /desu/ with the [u] being pronounced.\n\n• Sometimes words or verbs start with an [o].\n\n• Negative form for words or verbs ends in -nu sometimes, but I also remember -nai and -nee used a lot. I think boys and older people used -nee, -nu also older people and -nai was the more common/girly.\n\n• I do remember words finishing in [e], such as すげえ /suɡeː/ as said before, but I think that's boys and elders that used it. I got told sometimes the words I use are for guys and informal. But I remember talking properly at home was very important, I don't think it was good to talk like that at home.\n\n• I remember the copula じゃ jya, and だ da being used.\n\nI remember these songs: Edo no Uta, Kagome Kagome, a song about a white rabbit, a sort of melody with the numbers from 10 to 20, and songs sang by the kagura miko with the bells at a shrine.\n\nI wrote a text [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/whitepasserine/comments/11rw5ol/the_shrine_i_remember/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) describing a shrine I remember a lot and another [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/whitepasserine/comments/11rx96g/other_locations_i_remember/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) other locations that I remember.\n\nAs I said in the shrine post, I'm writing this because I'm looking for a place I lived in as a child. I do know japanese still but many things I have forgotten/probably didn't learn either. My life has been messy and there's no way I can know where it exactly was. I have talked with people who know about Japan better than me in the past that have helped me a little with this, but there's many things that I don't find information of or that I can't see through Google Maps. There was someone who told me about Fushimi Inari Taisha and they used to live near it, so it's the biggest possibility in my mind, but I don't have contact with them anymore. A reddit user also pointed out Kumatakasha and a pond near it, which seems very, very familiar to me. Any information is more than welcome.",

        "text": "Hello guys :)  \n\nI've been thinking of getting a tattoo of a song lyric that means a lot to me, it's a song by Mitski and it's called First Love/Late Spring.  \nThe lyric in question is \" 胸がはち切れそうで \"  \n\nI wish to position it on my chest, below my collar bones and higher than my breasts, right in the middle, and I would like it to be symmetrical. I also don't want it to be tiny of a tattoo, mostly because of the possibility of 胸 losing a lot of detail if I choose a font that's too small, but that's basically where my problem begins.\nMy first idea was just having it written as is, in one straight horizontal line, a single straight sentence unit, across my chest, but now that I've realized it's going to have to be a bit bigger in order for it not to spill and bleed over time, I'm getting the feeling that it's going to look too awkward and long for my chest and that there will be a possibility of my tattoo artist wanting to split it in half so that it would make two lines of text to better fit my chest visually.  \nThis is where I'm wondering if there is a possibility for me to split the sentence in half, making it two horizontal lines of text (it doesn't matter if one is longer than the other) one beneath the other, and if it _is_ possible, exactly where I can split it in the sentence without changing the meaning or losing any of its original meaning?  \n(for example, if it was written as\n  胸がはち  \n切れそうで  \nWould that change the meaning of the sentence? Is there a case where disjointing it would change the meaning at all?)\nI'm very scared of this, and I don't want to accidentally, by splitting the sentence in order for it to make two lines, change it's meaning. I'm still a beginner in Japanese so I'm not well versed in this sort of problem so I figured it was best to ask you guys! Also my apologies if I didn't manage to describe it very well, English isn't my first language, so if you have any questions please ask, and thank you in advance for your time!!!",

Unless I stop the video to look things up I really don't understand a lot but this is not something I don't want to do, ideally; I'd prefer consuming as much as I can without looking stuff up since I'd be spending more than an hour dissecting a single episode instead of also working on vocab and grammar. \nBasically every time I'm stopping the videos I'm feeling like I'm sacrificing my time for something more important.\n\nI'm beginning the second volume of Genki and keeping up with N4 vocabulary in the meantime, it just feels like I'm not doing anything useful if I watch things that I don't understand most of the time... What would you suggest? \nI thought about getting easier to understand input instead of anime but I don't know if that would be more effective in any way.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/11rgubg/chatgpt_and_the_daily_question_thread_reevaluated/",
        "text": "See [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/zejohl/chatgpt_and_the_daily_question_thread/) for reference. I have access to GPT-4 through the ChatGPT plus subscription, which is a much more advanced version of the original ChatGPT model. I'm posting the first responses to the same questions unedited. Feel free to reference the original post for the original answers. I'm not a Japanese expert and I don't know whether these responses are right. I heard the original answers were bad, so I'd be curious to know how these answers stack up. \n\n#Question 1\n\n&gt; What is meant by\n\n&gt; 手術をするロボットなくさんあって\n\n&gt; I don't get the なくさん part, Jisho doesn't come up with anything. This is from a Tobira text.\n\nIt seems like there might be a typo in the sentence you provided. The correct sentence should be:\n\n手術をするロボットがたくさんあって\n\nHere's the breakdown of the sentence:\n\n* 手術 (しゅじゅつ) means \"surgery.\"\n* する is the verb \"to do.\"\n* ロボット means \"robot.\"\n* が is the subject particle.\n* たくさん means \"a lot\" or \"many.\"\n* あって is the te-form of ある, which means \"to exist\" (for inanimate objects).\n\nSo, the sentence can be translated as \"There are many robots that perform surgeries.\"\n\n#Question 2\n\n&gt; What's the difference between:\n\n&gt; 経る (へる)\n\n&gt; 経つ (たつ)\n\n&gt; they both seem to mean when time passes and both are intransitive as well so I don't know the difference.\n\nYou're right that both 経る (へる) and 経つ (たつ) are intransitive verbs in Japanese that are related to the passing of time. However, they are used in slightly different contexts.\n\n経る (へる) is used to describe the passing of time or distance in a more general sense, and it can also refer to experiencing or going through something. It is often used with a specific period of time or a situation. Here are a few examples:\n\n* 時間が経る: time passes\n* 3年が経る: three years pass\n* 試練を経る: go through a trial\n\n経つ (たつ) is specifically used to express the passage of time and is often used with a duration. It usually implies the passing of time without any specific action or event happening during that period. Here are a few examples:\n\n* 時間が経つ: time passes\n* 3時間が経つ: three hours pass\n* 1週間が経つ: one week passes\n\nIn summary, while both verbs are related to the passing of time, 経る (へる) has a broader range of meanings and can be used to describe going through or experiencing something, while 経つ (たつ) is more specifically used for the passing of time without implying any specific action or event.\n\n#Question 3\n\n&gt; 私キチンと水族館を楽しめる計画立ててきてるの。。。 What does adding きてる to the sentence do at the end?\n\nIn the given sentence, \"きてる\" is a casual, colloquial way of saying \"来ている\" (kite iru) in Japanese. It is a combination of the verb \"来る\" (kuru), which means \"to come,\" and \"いる\" (iru), which is used to indicate the progressive or continuous form of an action.\n\nWhen \"きてる\" (kite iru) is added at the end of the sentence, it implies that the speaker is currently engaged in the activity of planning or has already started the process of making a plan. In this case, the speaker is saying they are making or have made a plan to properly enjoy the aquarium.\n\nHere's the translation for the sentence: \"I'm making a plan to properly enjoy the aquarium.\"\n\n#Question 4\n\n&gt; How can I say “he comforted her” in Japanese? As in, perhaps she is crying and he’s trying to make her feel better with either words or a hug Also, is there a distinction between comforting (as in an upset adult) and soothing (as in a crying baby)? Thank you\n\nIn Japanese, \"he comforted her\" can be translated as 彼は彼女を慰めた (Kare wa kanojo o nagusameta). This phrase can be used to describe comforting someone who is upset, such as an adult, with words or physical actions like a hug.\n\nThere is a distinction between comforting an upset adult and soothing a crying baby. While \"慰める\" (nagusameru) is used for comforting, \"あやす\" (ayasu) is often used for soothing a crying baby. So, if you want to say \"he soothed the crying baby,\" you can say 彼は泣いている赤ちゃんをあやした (Kare wa naiteiru akachan o ayashita).\n\n#Question 5\n\n&gt;&gt; ずっとゲームをしないでたまには勉強もする。\n\n&gt;&gt; Instead of continuously gaming, I occasionally also study.\n\n&gt;I don't understand the で here. It can't be the te-form of だ because -ない is an i-adjective. It can't be the instrumental/locative case particle either because -ない is an adjective and not a noun. So what is it then?\n\nIn this sentence, the で is actually a particle that indicates the means or manner of an action. It's not related to the te-form of だ or the instrumental/locative case particle for nouns. Here, the で is used with the verb する (to do) to form an expression.\n\nIn the phrase \"ずっとゲームをしないで\", で is used after the negative form of the verb する (-ない) to indicate \"without doing\" or \"instead of doing.\" So, \"ずっとゲームをしないで\" means \"without continuously gaming\" or \"instead of continuously gaming.\"\n\nThe full sentence \"ずっとゲームをしないでたまには勉強もする\" can be translated as \"Instead of continuously gaming, I occasionally also study.\"\n\n#Question 6\n\n&gt; whats the different in meaning and usage between \"にしては\", \"にしてからが\", \"にしたところで\" all of them describes usually something surprising or unexpected with regards to a person usually?\n\nYes, all of these expressions describe something surprising or unexpected, often with regards to a person or situation. They are used to make comparisons or indicate contrast. However, their meanings and usages are different. Let me explain each of them:\n\n1 - にしては (ni shite wa): This expression is used to indicate that something is unexpected or surprising given a certain standard, condition, or situation. It is often used when the outcome is better or worse than expected. It can be translated as \"for\" or \"considering.\"\n\nExample: 彼は日本語を始めて一年にしては、上手ですね。 Kare wa nihongo o hajimete ichinen ni shite wa, jouzu desu ne. Considering he's only been learning Japanese for a year, he's quite good.\n\n2 - にしてからが (ni shite kara ga): This expression is not commonly used, and it seems like a combination of two separate expressions: \"にしてから\" (ni shite kara) and \"からが\" (kara ga). If you meant \"にしてから\" (ni shite kara), it can be used to indicate the time since something occurred or began. It can be translated as \"since\" or \"from.\"\n\nExample: 彼女は卒業してから仕事を探しています。 Kanojo wa sotsugyou shite kara shigoto o sagashiteimasu. She has been looking for a job since she graduated.\n\n3 - にしたところで (ni shita tokoro de): This expression is used to convey that even if a certain condition were met, it wouldn't change the outcome or situation. It can be translated as \"even if\" or \"even though.\"\n\nExample: 彼に頼んだところで、助けてくれるわけがない。 Kare ni tanonda tokoro de, tasukete kureru wake ga nai. Even if I asked him for help, there's no way he would help me.\n\nIn summary, \"にしては\" is used for expressing unexpected outcomes based on a certain condition, \"にしてから\" indicates the time since an event occurred, and \"にしたところで\" expresses the idea that a certain condition wouldn't change the outcome or situation.",

I'm a language-lover and pick things up fairly quickly. I've watched anime for years, and have been self-studying Japanese for about 4 months. I can read hiragana and katakana, and understand a fair amount of basics. I'm wondering if people who have gone to language school in Japan could share their experiences here. Specifically I'm looking at GenkiJACS and Meiji Academy in Fukuoka (I'm interested in Fukuoka because it isn't huge like Tokyo, and is much cheaper to live in). I'd love to hear how long you stayed, how you liked your school (please give the name!) and things you wished you would have done differently. \n\nGenki has already told me their October 2023 intake is full, so I'll probably need to wait for April 2024. I'm hoping to go for 1 year. I've read some reviews that said their beginner program is great, but the intermediate program falls a bit short. If I wait a year before I go I'm worried I'll be too studied to really take full advantage of the beginner's course. Is that ridiculous or is there some sense to that?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you all in advance!",

The only thing I could find was in kitsuneko, but apparently they don't have all the episodes' subs (actually, they don't even have half of the episodes). \n\nHidamari Sketch is one of my favourite anime of all time and I would love to use it now that I'm learning Japanese through immersion. \n\nIf someone here downloaded these subtitles in Japanese in the past and have them all (the four seasons), it would be great if you could share them with me!! \n\nThank you so much in advance!!",

These books are all about the localization details from translating these games from Japanese to English and for the newest one: Undertale, English to Japanese.\n\nHe releases these bonus things alongside the books called \"passports\" that are basically little guides that will let you play and understand these games in Japanese. They teach you kana and a little relevant kanji.\n\nThe Undertale one is coming out soon and I wanna pick it up. A side note, the Undertale passport is much, MUCH bigger than the ones for the other two books, Zelda and earthbound. It's a game I've already beaten multiple times and a game I love. I thought that this sounded like a really fun way to start my learning journey. Even if it takes me a long time to get through the game and I have to look a bunch up. Obviously I plan on learning past this with other material and this won't teach me everything. Plus I plan to learn the kana first.\n\nBut what do you think? Do you think this would be a fun way to start?",

Let's do that tonight!\", but alas, my confidence in kitsunekko.net was too great, it didn't have this anime. How disappointing!\n\nI saw Amazon.jp streamed it on Prime but I don't have a Japanese credit card and my USA-based ones won't work. I notice that Prime offers it through Docomo Anime Store (dアニメストア) and their stand-alone site seemed to have [episodes]((https://animestore.docomo.ne.jp/animestore/cd?partId=22118001)) for sale.\n\nSo I create a Docomo account (USA is in the allowed list of countries to do so) and return to Anime Store only to be foiled by the credit card thing again.\n\nHow sad!\n\nI love that BookWalker.jp lets me buy things via PayPal, I've bought several titles from them that way and read them in their app/website, so I was hoping to get lucky with Docomo but looks like the only payment mechanism is credit card.\n\n(It's also plausible that even if I could buy on Docomo, that it wouldn't play (IP address vs geographic restriction).
