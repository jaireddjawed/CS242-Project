The problem is, light takes a while to travel and I'd like for people to see this play out over the course of a couple of years which is near instant when looking at the timeline of the universe.\n\nThis is a high fantasy setting, so magic can be involved but I'll be most satisfied if it can be connected to theoretical science. \n\n\nOne of the ideas I'm playing around with, and trying to wrap my brain around, is the universe is hitting a big crunch and as it fold in on itself, time is moving rapidly backwards. This flow of time has not reached the home world of the players by the time they notice this.\n\nAgain, big crunch with the players home world being the center. Maybe something happens that extinguishes all light in the universe for all of a second?\n\nI understand this is a hard mark to hit, but let me hear what you got. Closest you can get.

I can't remember the characters' names or anything important for search terms... but the protagonist was a funny, obnoxious military man whose consciousness was uploaded into an android body. He was charged with finding habitable planets for humans to relocate to.\n\nThere was one planet where the people were the size and shape of donuts, and one of the leaders referred to himself as (something) The Fat. There was an earlier planet where a powerful species had given up space travel and wanted nothing to do with the outside world, but they gave him some special technology, yet wiped his memory of how he got it.\n\nHe landed on another planet where he had a fling with a local woman whose head looked like a football. She ended up going with him on his spaceship when he left.\n\nHis spaceship had an AI that was SO sarcastic, funny and crazy-making.\n\nI don't remember the name of the author, the name of the book, the names of any of the characters... it's just something I listened to while I was falling asleep at night. It was included in the Audible Plus catalogue but suddenly just disappeared one day, and I can't find figure out. Audible staff can't see what I was listening to and they don't know what the book was.\n\nDoes any of this ring a bell to you? Do any of you know this story, and importantly, the title?\n\nYou'll have my thanks if you can help.\n\nCheers!",

Follow a resourceful orphan as he fights his way up a discriminatory society using technical skills and battle instincts. A lot of repair and crafting is involved. \n\nI'm a full-time satellite engineer, so most of the tech can be realistically derived from today's technology. More importantly, I have radiators in ships. If you're an engineer you'll love this book.\n\nHowever, FTL and exotic materials exist as part of 'handwavium' so I would classify the book as medium sci-fi overall. Hard worldbuilding - I theoretically should have an in-world explanation for everything that is not 'handwavium' when you ask me. \n\nI also watch a LOT of Isaac Arthur's videos, which have helped me a lot in technical design. \n\nArc 1 is complete with 200k words and 74 chapters. Thank you for giving it a try. If you have any feedback feel free to comment.\n\n[Current Book Cover](https://preview.redd.it/u6dyqsa5wxga1.png?width=1423&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3953473fa5fa28b274da8cfcae353eb805480276)",

Their claws and teeth are for anything their tail cannot reach or handle. \nTheir eyes positions, 2 forward eyes and 2 on the sides of their head. Offer an almost complete 360° view. \n\nThese beings like to stay near bodies of water and prefer forests. Their diet consists mostly of vegetation, but they will eat small insects, worms, small creatures, and fish.\nTheir preferred vegetation is fruit and underwater vegetables. \n\nTheir like to live in burrows, though they have modernized their burrows. You can often find most Agnar burrows, to have dirt floors and walls. \nWhen they mate, they will seek out warm waters and dove below 10ft. If available. \nThey will make nests in their burrows, next to the parents bed. The female will lay up to 1 to 6 eggs, the nests will be made up of any soft and insulated material. The eggs are white with red dots at the bottom of the shell. \nThe parents will only check on the eggs and occasionally, they will with them for a few hours. This goes on for 7 months, by the 7th month, the eggs will invert colors if they are healthy and alive. \nDead or unhealthy eggs will not and are disposed of. \n\nThey are a spiritual race and are quite advanced. They have a small defense force, but are protected under the Liberty Republic.\n------------\n\nThe Omnti, these 3ft humanoid like creatures. Who have spikes covering their heads, down their backs. They are hook claws on their hands and feet. They are known to live on mountains, in ravines and canyons, and inside caves.\nThey half dark skin, black eyes, and flat noses. \nThey have evolved to almost constantly climb and live in small caves on the sides of mountains. \n\nNot much is known about these creatures, besides that they birth eggs with a sticky substance, they use to keep eggs in thermal vents, to keep them warm. \nWhen the eggs hatch, the infants will climb out of the vent and seek out the closedt pack. \n\nThey are scavengers and commonly feed on eggs, carcasses, wild vegetation, and cave mushrooms. \n\nTheir technology is complex and difficult for most to understand.\nTheir culture is unknown.\n---------\n\nThe Wignba, 8 legged fungal beings with an oval body, with 2 arms at the front, and 20 eyes across its body. They are noted to have random growths, that take on a spikey or horn like appearance.\nEach let can enact as an arm, as each has 3 appendages at the end. They are pure fungi, but due to their underground origins. They developed a form similar to spiders. Though, this is one of the main ruling races of the faction, Houses of Sedulity. \n\nThey are more technological based beings. Focusing on research and development for the Houses. They dominate their homeworld in swarms. \nThough, they focus on research. They reproduce like puffballs, shooting out clouds of spores. That are picked up by the wind and grow wherever they land. \nThey are a dime a dozen and used as frontline units or at least their spores are used as weapons. \n\nThey like to live in damp places and are known to glow in the dark, at will. \n\nTheir culture surrounds dominantion, they see science is the easiest way to dominant. \n---------\n\nLeth, these fungi take on a humanoid form, but they are anything but human. \nThey havs no eyes, they have a white outer layer with red patches, they have small mouth for sound, no teeth, all their limbs can grow in length at will, they are very tall and thin, and they have no understanding of personal space or comfort. \nNo known culture, their technology is most made of themselves. \nThey only attack when threatened, their language is a form of screaming, they have no natural predators besides a large but rare beast, and are incredibly capable physically.",

        "text": "I read this on this sub but that comment was downvoted. But imo it made a good point\n\n\nScience back in Medieval times were wished to be magic and the scientists in Medieval times were accused of being wizards and witches. For example: if I traveled to the Holy Roman Empire and started flaunting my awesome smartphone and internet connection, I would be accused of witchcraft and be executed. They didn't think of technology as a way to enhance life, they thought of it as a way to try and fix human imperfections. This is showcased in fantasy settings with magic healing spells, magic power spells, etc\n\n\nNow modern Sci-Fi is just where scientists are portrayed how they exist in our current world. Scientists and technology are used to enhance our daily lives or are used to make things easier, more efficient, or improve the climate etc etc. All of these things are due to how we perceive technology and scientists. If we all perceived technology as the downfall of mankind-- which some of do-- we would have Sci-Fi settings wherein Technology is the antagonist and the protagonist liberates humanity from the clutches of technology and evil scientists \n\n\nI think this really makes sense. I really think Fantasy and Sci-Fi are the same genre... Think about it: Science Fantasy is a blend of both genres and is its own thing. When is there a fusion of two genres that is so common? Never, it's only Sci-Fi and Fantasy that are fused into one genre!",

        "text": "##Invisibility suits and cloaking mechanisms\n\nWhenever a Sci-Fi story has this these things NEED limitations- otherwise why isn't literally everyone and everything in an invisible cloaking suit and sneaking around to kill the entire main cast with no effort? These things are overpowered and need to have the battle systems revolve around it or severely limit the capacity at which things can go \"invisible\"\n\n\n##Brainwashing/altering memories\n\nThis will either turn the plot into a contrived mess, or make you wonder why the antagonist group doesn't just erase the memories of everyone that knows their bad doings, etc\n\nAlso the fact that this would easily be a crime against humanity and if existed in the real world would probably never see use due to just how inhumane it actually is \n\n\n##Time travel \n\nAs we all know, unless the story revolves around time travel, it will become a contrived mess as soon as the element is introduced. If time travel exists then the story has literally no consequences because you know every character can be saved by going back in time to where they die. \n\nAlso it becomes even more contrived because you have to figure out whether or not it's supposed to be infinite timelines or just a finite amount. If it's infinite then time travel doesn't actually fix the problem. If it's finite then time travel is an overpowered system that can erase all the tension and conflict\n\n\nTime Travel either needs full dedication within the plot, or just never exist within the story",
