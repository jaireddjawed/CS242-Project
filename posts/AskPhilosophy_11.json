As with other UK programs, it requires the equivalent of a US masters.\n\nI found this intriguing and wondered: what kind of scholars are doing this? People with day jobs? Has anyone done a similar program themselves (US, UK, or otherwise) and have an opinion on how it went?",

        "text": "Hello, my country is going through a xenophobic phase, where many people treat foreigners badly because they seem to be the the ones inflating our life cost, mainly because it's a country that relies on tourism. I hope to be corrected in case my explanation is too simple, because I am no expert in economics and things are usually complex, but this is the main point:\n\nFor the most part, it seems like the natives are selling and renting houses by absurd prices to foreigners, restaurants increase their prices because the foreign clients are around and have much more to pay for, and, taking advantage of general inflation, many supermarkets are having more profits by raising prices much more than needed. This, of course, makes the natives pay much more than they used to, because now they have to 'compete' with foreigners with higher salaries.\n\nWith these points in mind, how are foreigners to blame for some of the inflation (that is not related to the war, lack of raw materials, etc), if the greed of the natives seem to be the main issue here? If people did not increase overall prices so much to sell goods to the foreigners, mostly out of greed, would there be a world where inflation was not so prevalent? They do have the choice not to inflated prices, at least so much.\n\nSurely the Government can interfere in some of these questions, but if we look only into the dynamics of people who own property or are in a position to raise prices, is it the foreigner's fault that the there is inflation in some sectors, or can we blame the greed of natives who are selling goods at a price that will cause other natives (and themselves) pay more for things overall?",

I can’t even think of anyone who isn’t hedonistic. We all are seeking pleasure be it through activities, or an afterlife, or feeling of happiness when we help others/raise a family/whatever. It seems common sense that all humans are motivated by feeling good. We just have different paths we take to get that pleasure.",

What I refer to \"universal predictive model\" is akin to the equations of Newton and Einstein. That they are universal therefore applies in every cases independent of a particular observation. What about predictive models that are built on calculations and only apply to a particular case?? What if our predictive model only apply to particular cases which we observe yet we assume them to be universal?? Can we make a criteria of whether our predictive model applies universally or particularly?? I find that particular predictive models are more abundant in social sciences, for example, making predicition about financial crisis on a range of year XXXX-XXXY. There's an underlying theory behind this prediction but it only applies on this particular case and not to other cases, future, past, or present.

You are free to pursue whatever you want, make the world a better place, do good things, spend time with your family.\n\nI am genuinely confused and I am not sure if this is a mental problem because I know this is a very rhetorical question and it should be obvious but **what is good?**\n\nGood to you may not be good to others, you may be doing good to people around you at the expense of others that you don't see. For example, we build houses and pollute Earth, many animal species went extinct, lack of homes.\n\nSome told me to just focus in the present, do what you should do right now, your responsibilities.   \nLet's say I found a job that pays very well, I started exercising, I found interests, hobbies. Who is to say that is a better life than where I am right now?\n\nMake the world a better place, how sure are you that what you are doing, even your guts told you so is 100% right?\n\nGood is related to happiness, now what if I say there is this man who find genuine happiness in killing others or doing bad deeds onto others. He cries and get depressed if he doesn't manage to kill the person he wanted to kill. Now what is good or bad in the POV of his? Happiness is a feeling, so if he felt that emotion while killing others, does that mean he is doing **good** thing in his POV?\n\nWhy do good to others? Even sometimes in the expense of yours? Some said, you will feel happy helping others. What if you don't? what if helping others gives you an disadvantage. What is then considered good or bad?\n\nI question good and evil, a subjective fact. As I said earlier, evil must exist in order for good to exist. So why do good things then? ignoring the fact that everything is meaningless? Evil will still exist and will always, no matter what good you do. \n\nWhat exactly am I doing? How do I know if I am on the right track?  \nFulfillment, Progress is what most people tells me when I asked **why should we live?**  \nHow do you measure progress then? How do you know the 'more' is actually 'more' and not 'less'? or that the 'more' is actually better and not worse? Lets say my family is doing well, health is doing well, career is doing well. **What then?** If life is meaningless and the meaning is up to you to decide, why should we live? instead of choosing to cease to exist now. Why is there so many objection to voluntarily suicide.\n\nMany people who have experienced time (old people) told me that time flies very fast, at their 60s, what is in their 30s 40s is like a dream, a blob of memories and death is getting closer and closer as time goes by. It scares me that, after that **it's gone, my existence, fade into nothingness.**\n\nThe thought of wanting to exist and the thought of NOT existing is horrifying, I may not be able to feel it but that's the point, that is what is horrifying.\n\n**All I see is an illusion,** this purpose, this happiness, this seeking for a 'better life', it is temporal and it is not certain and it dreads me, despair.\n\nWhatever I am doing now, will disappear, vanish as if it didn't happened and even if it did happened because I experienced it, I will eventually forget about it. After all, my whole existence is on a ticking clock.\n\n Some told me we can't control time, and nor can we control whatever I said will happen, **it is inevitable.** So is the solution to my angst just to stop thinking about it/ignore it? or go with the delusion/illusion that it won't happen? Isn't that a little bit pitiful? **How do I be optimistic about it?** \n\n We humans succumb in this vicious cycle thinking things will get better, get hit by adversities and then repeat as if we are transcending/growing into a higher state, but are we? These accomplishments, overcoming obstacles, are they any different from an apple dropping from a tree.\n\nTo live in the present, does that means I should totally disregard what future awaits? So why care about your studies, your career, your relationships? why build relationships then if not for the potential future both parties can enjoy together?\n\n**Life is meaningless therefore just live a good and meaningful life** is what people tells me. All these adjectives, makes me imagine what is good like to me in my head and then I question, will I really be contented? Will things not change from there even if I have 'attained' them? I feel like humans will forever keep on chasing that illusion of 'good' even though change is the only constant. Lets say 100k salary is what you think being successful is, when you attained it. Who is to say you won't want more? Who is to say things will get better from there? I don't think life is that generous and that is what scares me. **Won't you get tired of constantly trying to be better?**  This sense of achievement/self satisfaction that we are forever chasing.\n\nSome said **infinity** has no beginning which my initial thoughts were that everything has an absolute beginning which got me thinking about the universe, where did it come from? Some said it is the bigbang then I asked where is the bigbang comes from? that singularity where did that come from? even if we got an answer for that, we don't have an answer for before that, thus forming an infinite loop which make sense, now that also means when we die, time is gonna flow infinitely ahead as well and that is scary to me. I ponders into eternal life then I got scared of infinity, eternal, eternal solitude while being scared of death, I am scared of the future, I am scared of being pointless, I am scared that everything I do becomes nothing eventually, then what's the point? Too little time, too much time both scares me. \n\n**I fear time**, of course time has to flow otherwise changes cannot happen, like a time-freeze where everything stops moving/working but anything in the presence of time will decay and die and I meant everything. You, your family, your memories, your legacy, the Earth that we live in, the galaxy and eventually the universe. Some refute they may not but that makes me trigger my apeirophobia as well (Infinity).\n\nSome told me about absurdism,  the 'just do it' mentality but I fear I will grow cold to my loved ones, I am scared of what I am gonna become if I became indifferent, I care nothing.\n\nWe humans chase the illusion of happiness, not knowing that suffering comes hand in hand with happiness, without suffering there won't be happiness. We use coping mechanisms like religion to give us purpose in life but what scares me is nothing lasts, therefore nothing is ever truly gained, an illusion. \n\n We humans succumb in this vicious cycle thinking things will get better, get hit by adversities and then repeat as if we are transcending/growing into a higher state till the day we cease to exist, but are we? These accomplishments, overcoming obstacles, are they any different from an apple dropping from a tree.",

        "text": "Hello to everyone,\n\nCurrently I am having this dilemma and I really would like to have some other perspectives on my situation.\n\nHow do you choose the meaning of your life? How do you know if you are in \"bad faith\", like Sartre would have said?\n\nFrom an existentialist point of view, I determine the meaning of my life with my choices. \nAnd, ontologically speaking, there isn't a better or a worse choice that I can take. Everything that I will choose will be correct, because the existence precede the essence. \n\nBut then, if every life choices is the same, how can I decide which path should I take? \n\nFor example, now I am devour by the question: \"should I continue my 7 year long term relationship with my partner, or should I return single and explore how would be my life alone?\" \n\nIn both cases I know that I will be happy:\n\n- If I choose my partner, I know that if I put effort and commitment on our relationship we will be happy together, I will obtain something in my life, while renounce to some others;\n- If I choose to be single, I will give a new meaning to my life, and I will be anyway content, obtaining something (freedom) while renouncing to other things that a LTR relationship can offer;\n- I can also choose to have LTRs with other people if I want; and I will surely find new people in the world with whom I will be happy. \n\nSo I feel stuck, because with every choice I know that I will obtain something, while renouncing to other opportunities, because we cannot experience everything in life. And in the end, an existentialist point of view tells me \"don't worry, in any case you will be happy and there is no wrong or right choice\". \n\nHow can I understand if the meaning that I want to give to my life is one of commitment and intimacy to one person, and to that person specifically, while fighting with the ideas of all the other lifes that I could have experienced? It's like a FOMO life experiences. \n\nI hope that I explain myself. \n\nMany thanks in advance for your support.",

As a result knowing PI and the Tractatus was wished by W to be published together perhaps the order must start with (1)? \n\nTo clarify: \n(1): PI\n(2): Wittgenstein the film by Derek Jarman\n(3): The Paper on ^ (which I presume has spoilers of the film since it analyses it) \n(4): Other later works. \n\nI am also aware of: \n\nBut I feel it isn’t wholly suitable given my specific desires. \n\nPlease do let me know if I am being totality conceited or too specific in my trying to read and do offer up a better solution which you thing is better. \n\nThank you very much for your time and help.",

I liked it, he showed me some good symbolism i wasnt clearly aware of before - order and chaos, how they were imagined as across the years, and that they both can be both good and bad.\n\nThat gave me some artistic inspiration. Yes, that's what i came for, and I got it once. So don't say it isnt possible.\n\nThen I read some Nietzsche. I chose the \"Human, All too Human\" because that was when he got disappointed in Wagner, and I wanted to see what he has to say about it and in general. Interestingly, it reminded me of my journal entries, when I write my thoughts on various things. His felt more clear and smart than mine though. But the thing is I mostly agreed with them, and for his period of time, would agree completely. I didnt feel challenged. \n\nAnd after that, its pretty much nothing. Skimmed through various philosophers and it seems they are just trying to find arguments to make their view look good. I even found some support for my beliefs, but it was the same old weak drivel of morality and I wasn't too impressed. And it's not what I'm really after anyway. There also were some logicians that tried to make definitions for words that didnt really need new definitions, so that wasn't fun too.\n\nI even read a Japanese philosopher for contrast (An Inquiry into the Good) but it seemed to me he was just repeatedly implying the idea that logic isnt perfect anyway (definition of words dont really mean the thing) so people shouldnt think it's better than the figurative thinking (on which i fully agree, but still, I didnt come just to agree with someone).\n\nAnd so I am asking you about some philosophers that give some realistic, good stereotypes of things that really exist on this earth but people are not clear about, and that I can use as artistic inspiration (like with early Peterson). Preferrably more contemporary, for I believe the later the age, the stronger the people. A bit less spiritual than **William Blake** (yes i am aware of him), but still spiritual enough.",

After this leaders term power will be held by an 'oligarch' or probabably in modern terms we might call them an 'establishment candidate'. Followed up by a 'peoples choice candidate', a populist or a demagogue that rallies the people into action. Usually having much debate in a peroples rule ends when a decisive problem emerges that requires swift action without debate and the cycle continues.\n\n1. Who is this philisopher.\n\n2. Has their observation been proven true over time? If so is it a relatively true or absolutely true?\n\n3. Is it fair to break political leaders into these categories or does it miss something important later philosophized about?\n\nThanks!",

These distinctions were one of the major concerns of the work of Aristotle which was the first book to bear the name Metaphysics, and were a main target of classical anti-metaphysicians.  \n\nThe reference to \"anti-metaphysicians\" piqued my curiosity about who the most convinced/serious metaphysicians and anti-metaphysicians are. Who would you suggest exploring for someone who'd like to check out contrasting views on metaphysics? I have the impression that e.g. Nietzsche and Plato clash hard on this (I wonder whether anyone would say that this is too simplistic).

The same rule applies to private and public matters. You should buy your friend ice cream if it maximizes everybody’s pleasure over pain. And the government should go to a war with another government if it maximizes everybody’s pleasure over pain. You get the picture.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Negative utilitarianism drops pleasure (the “positive” value) out of the equation and focuses on pain and suffering (the “negative” value).** We should always try to minimize suffering in the world. This is quite compatible with antinatalism, but it was noted early on that abiding by it consistently would lead to a world without human beings. And that was seen as a clear and simple refutation of the view. ([Source](https://youtu.be/4L1eiDoMuCQ?t=578))\n\nSo I'm curious: Is there also a form of Positive Utilitarianism that takes the \"negative\" value out of the equation, the same way that NU does with \"positive\" value?",

You find the definition of \"smart\": \"Someone who is clever\". Now you have a problem. These definitions are circular, which means you can't derive their meaning. If you really consider this, using words to describe other words is all circular.\n\nImagine you want to learn a new language. This language has zero similar words to English or any other languages you know. Now someone gives you a dictionary in this language.(No translations but just definitions in that language)\nYou  will quickly notice that is is practically impossible to learn anything from this dictionary as you lack a foundation of word meanings in this language so the definitions of the words are useless.\n\nSo now you may ask yourself  how you learned your first language if all language is circular. Well one option would be that some words are somehow self defining. Another option would be that our first words are explained by other means of communication. Imagine a parent pointing at the sun and saying \"sun\" . A child could learn the word sun though simple correlation. \nThis might just be shifting the problem as a child might not mean what pointing at something means. (It's not like you can tell them)\n\nAnother alternative would be evolution: Imagine a wolf howling when danger is near. Other wolves in the pack may or may not understand that a hotel means danger, but wolves that do would have a significant advantage.\n\nSo what are your thoughts? I think this might be a really good example of a uncaused first cause(or a self defining word or something like that). I would be grateful if let me know  if anyone has written a paper or book on this subject.",

I'm relatively new to philosophy, so I've just started dipping my toes in.\n\nReading about act and rule utilitarianism on IEP, the author brings up what they call the \"wrong answers objection\" to act utilitarianism where a simple form of utilitarianism seems to give very unintuitive answers to various moral questions, e.g. is it permissible to forcibly donate a healthy person's organs to dying people, etc. I agree that it seems intuitively horrendous to me to perform this act. But should I trust that my (or others') intuition is closer to the truth of the matter than this philosophical theory? Why or why not? Perhaps ironically, my own intuition has me skeptical of itself. \n\nIf we accept the \"wrong answers objection\" to act utilitarianism, must we then be committed to finding a moral theory that simply connects all of our pre-formed moral intuitions in the nicest way? Or could we still argue for a moral theory that runs against our intuition in some cases? \n\nIt seems many objections to and defenses of philosophical theories in areas other than morality also seem to rely on our intuition. Is this the case or am i mistaken? If it is the case, and our intuition is heavily relied upon, why develop philosophical theories in the first place? Why not just rely on our intuition to answer every question?\n\nThank you for any thoughts, references, criticisms or clarity.",

And one of the takes I've seen quite regularly is that he urges conversations and propositions on ethics and metaphysics, but we must admit that we may never make true sense of it, since its sense lies outside of the world. And yet, he says we must remain silent on it, as it cannot be said, but it will shown, it will present itself.\n\nSo... if we must remain silent doesn't that kill all capacities for conversation? Does W. give an advice that he advises no one to follow? As in \"this would be ideal, but it's an ideal we cannot/should not (?) upkeep.\"\n\nI know (if I've not misunderstood) that this is the core paradox of the book that no one has any truly good answer for. I guess my question is, why would he say something so contradictory? Say something, and then act against it?

In particular someone argued that the Caravaggio’s Saint Peter was too theatrical and therefore it was lacking of authenticity. From my personal point of view the crucifixion of Caravaggio was way more authentic compared to Reni’s very harmonic mannerism: the tilted cross in the act of being put in place,Peter’s feet already covered with blood, Peter’s struggle as if he was fighting against his punishers, the almost random point of view… and so on….this made me think about how the overall discourse about authenticity is somehow nonsensical and how it could be reduced to a discourse over the intention of the artist. In caravaggio the intention is to represent reality while in Reni is to represent divine harmony…but still this explanation is not satisfying me, still even if boring the question of authenticity in art some how eludes a comprehensive explanation.[reni](https://www.wga.hu/html_m/r/reni/1/st_peter.html) [caravaggio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucifixion_of_Saint_Peter_(Caravaggio))",

My problem is  that after I read a dense philosphical text that goes through various arguments and stuggles to find core ideas and try to read or hear different points of view, some philsophers take some of these ideas and I struggle to see if this generalization makes sense. Take say Marx and say the Hegelian framing of Marxist philosophy some later philosophers might ignore or purpesfully abandon such a framing and focus on other ideas in Marx's work and I struggle with making sense whether such a move is allowed, whether it's abandoning a core idea in the philosophy or not or whether my framing is too much of philosophy as an axiomatic system which it certainly isn't. \n\nMany foundational philosophers like Marx seem not only to have been interepreted by different philosophers in various ways and it seems unclear to me how I might now well what a philosopher assumes if they are building from previous work, so I need to read in a detailed manner and then more assumptions are added and I'm unsure how to deal with that.

        "text": "Howdy folks,\n\nI have been reading a lot about compatibilism recently, trying to get my head around the free will debate. As an aside, it seems to me, that unlike almost everything else I read about/find interesting, whether we have free will/are morally responsible matters a lot to how I feel (and probably how I end up acting) about myself and other people. I find it much easier to be compassionate toward myself, for example, when I adopt the \"I'm a robot running the algorithm programmed by natural selection\" framing and genuinely feel less angry/annoyed at other people. Obviously, though, there are downsides to the view that we don't have free will and you have to take the bitter with the sweet! But that's largely beside the point of this post. As I use free will/moral responsibility here, they are two sides of the same coin, i.e., you are morally responsible if you have \"free will\" and vice versa.\n\nSimplifying a lot, an incompatibilist would say that those who lack the ability to do otherwise are not morally responsible. A compatibilist says no, even someone whose actions are fully determined can be morally responsible. But the reason *why* we hold (the right kinds) of people morally responsible for (certain) decisions even in a deterministic universe is that we have a very strong *intuition* that at least some people are morally responsible for some decisions. Or viewed slightly different, there is no *further reason* that we hold (some) people morally responsible for (certain) decisions. It is just a fact about human psychology--something that we *just do*. And so, if we can, we want to come up with a theory that can justify this intuition--hence, compatibilism. This is how I understand P. Strawson's work on compatibilism, and I wonder if it also might apply to other flavors of compatibilism. \n\nWhereas, if you ask a non-compatibilist *why* (if determinism/naturalism weren't true) people would be morally responsible but a wild animal is not, they would say something like \"X person could have chosen not to do the good/bad thing but she did it anyway.\" So there is a further reason underlying our judgments about moral responsibility that has something to do with the ability to do otherwise. And because we have no such ability, assuming determinism/naturalism is true, there is no moral responsibility.\n\nI am would say there's at least an 85% chance that I'm way off here, but this way of framing the debate might help explain why everyone always seems to be talking past each other--they are essentially operating at different levels.\n\nDoes this make any sense? Am I completely out to lunch?",

        "text": "11 years ago someone in the \"linguistics\" (not asklinguitics) subreddit asked about Wittgenstein and his relation to Linguistics. They received the following responses:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I thought Wittgenstein was deep and insightful until I studied linguistics (interestingly my interest in Wittgenstein and the philosophy of language led me to linguistics). The problem with Wittgenstein, and \\*\\*a large portion of the work in philosophy of language generally, is not that the ideas are bad but that they are under informed\\*\\*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe study of language has gone through a few radical paradigm shifts over the last century as a result of the scientific orientation linguistics has adopted in this study. In a way linguistics has completely changed the playing field when it comes to theories of language. \\*\\*For this reason, philosophers working without the benefit of the research and knowledge acquired so far from the linguistic approach are bound to create under informed, simplistic theories in much the same way a philosopher of physics unfamiliar with post-Newtonian theories in physics would\\*\\* (of course often it is not their fault because they were not alive to learn of the new research).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn short, Wittgenstein was certainly smart but his ideas about language are not very relevant to linguistics.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQ: So, could you maybe explain some of the things Wittgenstein was uninformed about that would have changed his perspective\\[?\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA: Pretty much everything of consequence that would be covered in a linguistics program. Perhaps it is unfortunate that much of the ground breaking work in linguistics is comparatively recent but, nonetheless, this is the case.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWittgenstein and his contemporaries had a very simplistic conception of language as a sort of system of signs used in communication. What they were speculating about was more semiotics than language. This led him down the path of positivism--initially thinking that formal systems like logic were relevant to natural language (the tractatus)--and later to thinking of language a social phenomena, a sort of multi-player game (PI).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I said there have been radical paradigm shifts in linguistics, I really mean that there have been radical paradigm shifts. Besides a possible superficial appearance of similarity nothing Wittgenstein has done bares on Chomsky's work or most of the modern work in linguistics. I don't have the time or the will to get into an explanation of linguistic theories but trust me on this, or crack open any linguistics journal and you will see that, the scientific approach to the study of language has produced some quite comprehensive and complex theories that explain linguistic phenomena that these philosophers and logicians were not even aware existed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThough Chomsky has only taken that coherence as far as syntax while Wittgenstein is more concerned about semantics.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSyntax and semantics are sub-fields in linguistics, but one of the important things to understand is that at every level in language, from phonology to pragmatics, there are processes that underlie the surface characteristics of the linguistic phenomena. Failing to account for these processes is failing to account for language.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn short, you can't talk about semantics without understanding the phonological and syntactic processes underlying language. Talking about the meaning of the sentence 'dog bites man' in terms of words is incomplete unless you account for the fact that noun function is a matter of word order in English (cf. man bites dog'). Or consider the meaning of 'He killed the man with an ax.' Who had the ax? There is at least two underlying structures to this simple sentence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOr consider that in many dialects of American English the words writer and rider have the exact same phonological form. There are rule ordering operations in phonology (or constraints in optimality theory if you prefer) that account for the underlying processes that produce this hymonymy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou're not going to make much sense of how meaning works in language if you think you can study words separate \\[of\\] other linguistic phenomena. \\*\\*And this is just a personal view, but when I read philosophers talking about words I feel the way a physicist might feel when reading an old philosopher taking about essences or aethers; it's a quaint and simplistic approach to the subject that is not likely to produce sound explanations or theories.\\*\\*\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe relevant thread:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/m3yf4/what\\_is\\_rlinguistics\\_take\\_on\\_wittgenstein/](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/m3yf4/what_is_rlinguistics_take_on_wittgenstein/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote that I'm aware of the fact that this was posted in a linguistics-related thread and that the commenter apparently has studied linguistics (at least if we believe what's said in the first comment which I can't verify). Still, it seems that the linguistics subreddit is somewhat akin to the r/philosophy subreddit (meaning it's less reliable, less academic and more open for laymen - including flat-out bullshit takes - compared to something like asklinguistics/askphilosophy and other subreddits) and the comments are pretty harsh and sweeping with regard to Philosophy (of Language).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I wonder what someone fairly knowledgeable, maybe even active in Philosophy of Language has to say about this. I'd imagine philosophers would have something to say about such negative appraisals of an entire subfield and a philosopher sometimes considered \"the greatest of the 20th century\". Lastly, also note that I've looked up both \"Wittgenstein\" (there are some, albeit disappointingly short, answers) and \"Philosophy of Language\" (the responses tend to have a more negative bend too), yet I'd still like to read a response/take on the above even if it's old and furthermore quite long (sorry about that).",

Surely inferring that all elephants are gray is only appealing to my observation that 100% of elephants I have seen are gray and is therefore, by its own definition, an inductive inference.\n\nMy understanding is that in abduction I already *know* the rule: in this case, that all elephants are grey.

        "text": "Ted Talks are obviously born within a capitalist system, but there is something that is so capitalist about it that it makes me cringe. I mean its imbedded within the whole self-improvment culture and the \"more you know the more you grow\" and \"the more you learn the more you earn\". Pushing experts to summarize 30 years of experience into a single talk seems so off. I know a bit of the Adorno's critique of mass culture and this applies to some areas.  Thoughts?",

        "text": "So lately I've been interested in philosophies regarding how much we are in control of our lives. There seems to be not a single philosophy that defends the position of people being able to do everything, if they put enough dedication to it. Even metaphysical libertarians say that there are some things outside of our control. Determinists on the other hand argue that nothing is in our control because there is only one possible way events can play out. Now there are also the compatibilists, who say that we can still describe ourselves as being free, even if we're predetermined.\n\nThere is just so much philosophy on the \"we have no control\" side of the spectrum. But on the other side, we've got metaphysical libertarianism basically dying out.\n\nIs there a philosophy, just as extreme as determinism, but reversed? Just as determinism says we have 0% control, is there a philosophy which claims we absolutely have 100% control?\n\nSomething along the lines of, if you get motivated enough or if you just try hard enough, you can do anything.\n\nFor those of you that don't quite understand what I'm looking for, I could give you an example.. A person that is not able to walk (disabled) would be regarded by metaphysical libertarians as truly not being able to walk. But is there a philosophy which claims, if this person thought a lot, he/she would develop some invention to help them walk.\n\nI'm fully aware that what I'm looking for isn't a realistic depiction of reality.\n\n*tl;dr \n\nIs there a philosophy, just as extreme as determinism, but reversed? Just as determinism says we have 0% control, is there a philosophy which claims we absolutely have 100% control?*",
