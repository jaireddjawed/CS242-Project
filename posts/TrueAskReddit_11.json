This is well known, and (rightly) an important lesson for people of today.\n\nMy question is, why is the story of the Native Americans so well discussed in today's society, when similar events have happened throughout history, but seem to be more accepted, or at least, less discussed/present in the public consciousness?\n\nFor context, I'm from the UK. I know that my country has been invaded, its different peoples robbed, displaced and killed, by various other nations many times in its history (and of course, likewise other countries at the hands of the UK). But in the UK, we never talk about the plight of the Picts, or the Celts, or the Saxons. It just seems to be an accepted part of history.\n\nIs it purely that these events happened more recently? Or that they were better recorded? Or is because these people (or close descendants) are still around today? Or something else?",
