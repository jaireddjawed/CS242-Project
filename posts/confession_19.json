I was 20 and I hooked up with this random dude.\n\nI woke up the next day and I was incredibly hungover. He was still asleep. I got up, walked to his bathroom which was attached to his room and washed my face (my makeup was an absolute mess.) And then once I'd fully woken up I came back into his room and saw he'd left. I heard him in the living room moving around and I heard the TV so I walked in... Still completely naked. \n\nTurns out it wasn't the TV. It was his family. His mum, dad, and two sisters. I obviously still hadn't fully woken up yet to notice the difference. \n\nI didn't even cover up straight away. I just stood there as everyone gasped. Then I realised, screamed, and went to run back into his room but fell over in doing so. The guy I slept with quickly shut the door behind me and shouted sorry through the door. Turns out they all made a surprise visit because they live far away. Safe to say I quickly got dressed and left and never saw him ever again (not because he wasn't lovely but because I couldn't see a world where I'd ever want to see his family again!)\n\nTL;DR: Walked into the living room naked in a one night stands flat. Saw his entire family. And promptly got dressed then left dying inside.",

        "text": "I'm not going to beat around the Bush. The guilt of this is eating me alive and rightfully so. I can't bear to live with myself anymore. I've ruined my life with this, and it is a permanent stain on my life, and I'm having trouble finding a way to live with myself. If I were to confess this to a family member, I fear they wouldn't love me anymore or would look at me differently. This I could not live with as they are the only reason I'm here today. Without them, I have no will to live at all and would 100% take my life. Not that this would be a tradegy. This wasn't supposed to be my life. I remember a time when I was normal and happy, and it's all gone because of what I did. I was a normal girl with friends, lipgloss, and good grades. I want a do over, and I can't deal with the fact that what is done is done. My life wasn't supposed to be like this, and i feel i have let everyone and myself down massively. People have told me to just move on and just leave it at that as I have done all I can but I'm in my late teens now and the fact that I will have to live with this HEAVY feeling forever is simply not worth it.  I can not see a way out of this. \n\nSo what did I do. Well when I was around 12-13 I (female) humped and grinded my sister who was about 5-6 at the time and this was with underware pulled down.This was a one time thing and i didn't hurt her physically at all and it wasn't forcefull or aggressive. I look at myself, and I wouldn't expect it of myself. I'm compassionate and would never want to hurt anyone at all because I'd struggle to live with myself. Every time I try to forget it or move on with my life , this is in the back of my head, and I ask myself, \"How can you live with yourself?\"You aren't normal and are a fraud.\" It's looking very bleak. I look at bad people, and it pains me to think I've done something to group myself with them \n\nI was stupid and disgusting then with no moral compass and a porn and masturbation addict as i have been exposed to porn ever since i could remember. ..perhaps 6 or 7, I'm not trying to excuse my actions in any way. I just wish I had never done it, of course. \n\nI have ABSOLUTELY NO DESIRE to do this now to anything or anyone. I myself feel sick right now. I don't know what I was thinking. It pains me to think that with just a bit more rational thought and thinking... Waitthis is GROSS would have prevented me from this, and I could live my life with a clean slate without all this guilt\n\nI love my sister with all my heart, so how I could do that I don't know. It's not something I would ever do or have the desire to do now as I am genuinely abhorred by my actions, and I've broadly brought it up to her, and she seems not to remember it AT ALL. I didn't want there to be a chance that she remembered. I just apologised in general for being a bad sister and not being the best person I could be for her. I've tried everything to move on even though I don't deserve to and even thought about deciding not to be here anymore but I figured that would cause more harm than good and I couldn't do that to my family whom I love VERY much.\n\nThank you for reading",

Not to undermine the situation but the damage was nothing awful, it was cosmetic — paint scratches/scuffs/transfer in one area. A pretty “regular” car, not going to share details but based on the model and looks of the car, I wouldn’t necessarily say it seemed to belong to a “car person.” Genuinely didn’t have time to wait plus it was in a plaza where people can spend all day with all different schedules.. also saw no witnesses so I left without a note — I’m a young and relatively new driver, I know what I should’ve done but in the moment I messed up.\n\nWhat’s done is done, I can’t go back and change what I did although I would if I could. Trust me, I feel awful! This guilt has been eating me up and I’m sure I’ll get my karma which is fair — that being said, I’m hoping I won’t get into trouble this one time. I’m paranoid about there being cameras but I guess it’s the risk I took .. not sure if the area has cameras though, I know it’s a day and age of cameras but you’d be surprised. also don’t know if the PD here cares.\n\nHow long until I’m in the clear?!",
