        "text": "If you work a desk job in customer service, you are usually very accustomed to the wretched phenomenon known as “the repeat customer”. One one hand, this person could be the result of some horribly unfortunate circumstances - eight leaks in two months? Yeah, that’s shitty. Let me see if I can help you with that. \nHowever, on the other, more familiar end of the spectrum, there are customers like Mrs. Kvetch.\n\nMrs. Kvetch is somewhere between sixty and two thousand years of age. Mrs. Kvetch is bored, and therefore perpetually in need of something to complain about. Mrs. Kvetch is a loony old bat whose marbles have clearly been absconded with, because how dare you suggest she lost them.\n\nWhen I started working at Joe Schmoe Homebuilders, Mrs. Kvetch had just purchased a new home in one of our actively selling communities. My training was trial by fire, because it was fourth quarter, and because Mrs. Kvetch had my direct line. Mrs. Kvetch called me every single day, from the beginning of December, all the way through February. \n\n&gt;My heater is broken.\n\n&gt;The heater is making everything too hot.\n\n&gt;The windows were installed crooked.\n\n&gt;My windows are dirty.\n\n&gt;My garage door is too noisy when it opens.\n\n&gt;I can’t hear the garage door open any more, and now I can’t hear my son come in the house he keeps scaring me.\n\n&gt;It takes 35 seconds for the water to get hot.\n\n&gt;The water from the tap doesn’t get cold, just lukewarm.\n\nIt went on and on and on. \n\nSomething exciting must have happened to Mrs. Kvetch around March, because she stopped calling suddenly. Maybe her nemesis at the Bingo parlor died, and she had to go pay her insincere respects. Maybe they were replacing the pastor at her church, and she was busy taking it upon herself to vet his doctrinal leanings. Maybe she was having too much fun harassing the local pharmacist asking if her 20+ supplement tablets were FDA approved. \nWhatever the hell it was that diverted Mrs. Kvetch’s attention from calling me daily, I thanked every god I’d ever heard of for the reprieve.\n\nThen, one sunny, happy Friday, my phone rang. Guess who it was?\n\n&gt; Warranty, this is Hyde. How can I help you?\n\n&gt;IS THIS HYDE?\n \nOh, merciful heavens…\n\n&gt;Hello again, Mrs. Kvetch.\n\n&gt;THE GROUT AROUND MY BATHROOM SINK IS CRACKING. FIX IT.\n\n&gt;Absolutely, ma’am…\n\nThe annoying requests began anew, except now they were even more ridiculous.\n\n&gt;My toilet’s clogged. FIX IT.\n\n&gt;A light bulb burned out. FIX IT.\n\n&gt;I scratched the paint on the inside of my closet. FIX IT.\n\n&gt;The gardener mowed my lawn too short. FIX IT.\n\n&gt;There are too many bugs outside. FIX IT.\n\nFortunately she’d slowed her pace to calling once a week, as opposed to every day.\n\nI attempted to stanch the flow of madness by gently letting her know that these things were not warrantable, they were homeowner maintenance issues. For my efforts, Mrs. Kvetch saw fit to reward me with a deafening stream of profanity, complaints, and threats to sue. \n\nHowever, I did not cave entirely. Instead of putting the foolish requests in writing for the poor field representative who handled her project, I played the sympathetic listener, said I’d open a ticket, and hung up on her. It’s been months now, and she has yet to call with a legitimate request for service. Every once in awhile she’ll call and tell me that her refrigerator is the wrong color - FIX IT! - or that the ceiling got lower overnight - FIX IT! - but otherwise, my method of dealing with her has worked wonders.\n\nInsufferable moldy old corpse.\n\nDid I mention the hilarious irony of the fact that her name is in reality Mrs. Kvetch? I didn’t even have to make that up…\n",

He signed up for the store because it offers financing options. He didn't read into those financing options and didn't realize that his purchase would have to meet a minimum threshold in order to be eligible for the 6/12/24 months interest free deal. So he had made several purchases that he needed to pay on immediately.  \n\nSo he had the brilliant idea to trade in his textbooks, and then use the value he got back to pay on the line of credit balance. Once again he did not read where the trade in program states that he would receive a gift card for the value of the books. \n\nAnd this leads him to call me. He is wanting to know how he can use the gift card balance to pay his store card balance. \n\nI apologize and inform him that it is not possible.\n\nCaller repeats back to me with different wording \"So I can't use a gift card balance that I have with you to pay for the credit card that I have with you?\"\n\nI further elaborate that the line of credit is managed by a different company and that they don't accept payment from and Amazon gift card. \n\nI was then informed rather rudely that I was being condescending and that I was insulting his intelligence. I apologized and started explaining that was not my intention, that I was merely trying to emphasize that even though the line of credit bears our company's name that it is managed by a completely different company. \n\nHe of course didn't hear that as he had cut me off right after the apology and said \"yeah, you are sorry.\" \n\nThankfully he then asked to escalate to a manager.\n\nI did get to hear a little of what he told the manager before I was able to hang up. Mainly he was griping that I was insulting his intelligence with his two master's degrees. \n\n**Two master's degrees and he still can't read**\n**Felt like an idiot, so therefore I must be condescending with an explanation of the situation.**\n\nTL;DR: I was verbally abused and called condescending because a guy with two master's degrees was an idiot.",

        "text": "Hi all, first-time poster etc. etc.  \n\nI've recently landed my first job in a call centre, and after working retail in the past (And loving /r/TalesFromRetail) The first thing I did was subscribe here. I work for a large sports clothing shop in the UK, we handle calls from online customers as well as from staff in our IRL stores. I work the late evening shift, so we get a mix of 'I've just come home from work and am pissed' and 'I've come home from a day out shopping and am pissed'. This call was from a customer of a store.  \n\nPM: Good evening, $Retailername customer care, how can I help?  \n\nLady: Hello, yes, let me tell you the situation. I went into your store in $Town and bought some trainers at £95, however the till accidentally charged my card twice. Yesterday, I phoned you and requested the second charge be refunded. The advisor I spoke to was very helpful, and went through the process with me. However, today I checked my bank, and I have only been refunded £45!  \n\nPM: ... Oh... kay...  \n\n&gt;Context: Usually in cases like this, the store process the refund, not us, that was Red Flag #1  \n\nPM: OK, can I please take your card details so I can check the transaction?  \n\n&gt; We exchange card details. As I'm writing them down on the whiteboard, I realise how the £45 number probably came about. I had just about finnished writing my number 4 and realised it looked an awful lot like a number 9. The person who authorised the transaction probably thought the agent wrote a 4 instead of a 9. As I have this epiphany, I gasp out loud and the customer asks me what's wrong. I explain.  \n\nPM: So what I'll do is, once I've checked the transactions, I will just put the extra £50 in your account, is that alright?  \n\nLady: Yes, that's absolutely fine, thank you so much! *Laughing at the silliness of a mispelled 9*  \n\nI put her on hold and take the whiteboard over to the guy who handles checking transactions. As a newbie employee I don't have access to that system yet. He checks it through, tells me the story is legitimate - there were two payments for £95 taken, and one refund of £45. He tells me to put another transaction through, but just to give the same inspection number as the last one and add some extra notes onto it. \n\nAs I'm walking back to my desk to tell her I can indeed go through with the extra £50 transaction, a supervisor who overheard my conversation with Payments Guy ran over to me (No small feat in our epically crowded office).  \n\nSV: DON'T REFUND THAT £50!!  \n\nPM: What?? Why??  \n\nSV: The second £95 transaction bounced. It was a failed transaction, and so it will automatically be refunded.  \n\nPM: So... How the hell did that £45 get authorised?  \n\nSV: No idea. But we're not allowed to take it back unless she agrees to it. Otherwise, she is completely allowed to just walk away with it, free £45 for her!  \n\nPM: Oh wow. I'll see what I can do then...  \n\n&gt; Right now, there are 4 people gathered around me waiting to hear this. I'm one of the newbies, and now I have to sweet-talk this woman into giving us £45? Cool.  \n\nPM: *Puts headset back on and un-holds the customer* Hi there, really sorry about making you wait that long. There's been a situation, and I'm going to have to ask you to do me a huge favour if that's OK?  \n\nLady: WHAT? What's wrong?  \n\nPM: Basically, the £45 you received was credited in error. You will be receiving the full £95 in your bank within the next couple of days, as the transaction failed and will be bounced back to you. This leaves an extra £45 in your bank account from us, which I'm going to cheekily ask you for permission to take back. I'm really sorry to have to ask, but the £95 will already be on its way to your account and the £45 wasn't supposed to go in, and so I am relying on your honesty to allow me to take it back out of your account.  \n\n4 staff members gathering round me: *Whispering* She's not gonna agree to that, no way!!\n\nLady: *Laughing again* That's absolutely fine, as long as the £95 will definitely be going back in!  \n\n*Collective sigh of relief as I thumbs-up those around me*  \n\nPM: Thank you very much, and I mean that. All I'm going to need off you now is the 3-digit security code on the back of your card.  \n\nLady: That's fine, it's okay! *gives code*  \n\nPM: Okay, one last time I need to pop you on hold for a couple of minutes to get this situation sorted completely.  \n\nI put her on hold, and while I'm still sat down, I hear her talking to her (presumably?) husband behind her about what's happening. He says that she could've very easily said no to that and gotten a free £45! She's laughing like crazy by now.\n\nI Run over to payments guy, tell him it's all fine and he is OK to take the £45 back, here's the details, etc.  \n\nPM: *Headset back on again* Thank you very much for waiting and for your co-operation, I'm happy to say this entire situation has been sorted, and I apologise so much for the inconvenience.  \n\nWe exchange pleasantries as she is stil laughing her head off, and the call ends.  \n\nTL;DR: A typo turns into an epically awkward situation. Thankfully, customer is cool about it.  \n\nExtra info: I have no idea yet how the original £45 got authorised, and whether or not the advisor from yesterday knows he fucked up. ",

I've had a LOT of job satisfaction in my job I've had for the past year, but also much frustration and secondary trauma (I deal with really serious health issues, I'm in scheduling for a women's health clinic, so I deal with abortions, rape aftermath, young kids freaking out over STD's, breast cancer scares... it's not for the faint of heart.)\n\nAnd all this for subsistence wage and getting by, without being able to put back more than like 15 dollars a month in savings, while living with 2 roommates. \n\nI applied for another job, still a Godforsaken call center job, but it's about a $10k a year raise. This money would be a dream come true. I could finally save to realistically get a newer car before my old hoopty kicks the bucket, save an emergency fund, maybe do a little modest traveling, do volunteer work instead of working second jobs, set up a future where my significant other can some-day move in, work part-time, and be able to spend more time with his kid... while still providing a necessary service to people. I want to hope it's not like every other call center job where they say you can \"advance from within\" but then they suck the life out of you taking 100 phone calls a day for 2 and 3 years... but I'm still really nervous. I interview VERY well, and I knocked the testing out of the park, but I'm still afraid. I'm not sure whether I'm more nervous about getting the offer, or *not* getting the offer. In any case, if I stay where I am, the turnover rate for the area of the company I want to get into is way too low, and growth too slow, for me to get off the phones and where I want to be. So it looks like basically... be a phone grunt for subsistence wage, or be a phone grunt for an actual living wage.\n\nBasically... what would you do?",

We gave all kinds of discounts to airline employees, and they had special membership numbers, so it was really obvious when we had an airline employee on the phone.\n\nI went to work on 9/11/01. I got a phone call from a gentlman who claimed to be an airline pilot for one of the airlines involved in the World Trade Center crashes. He told me that his mother had died a couple days before, and he'd traded away his flight shifts for a couple of weeks to settle her estate and plan her funeral.\n\nHe was supposed to have been piloting one of the flights that crashed into the World Trade Center. He was trapped in an unfamiliar city because he'd been flying standby to get to his mother's town and arrange her funeral and was trying to find a room for the night. He was wracked with guilt and sobbing because the pilot had taken his shift to be a good friend, and ended up dying in a fiery crash.\n\nIn all the years following this, I've never heard any story of if the pilots flying those planes were subbing for shifts or not, but his points number and account number indicated he *DID* work for an airline, and had stayed at the hotel many, many times before- definitely in the top 10% of points numbers. He told me that he felt like his mother had somehow intrinsically known this was going to happen, and died when she did to protect him. He swore he would never pilot/fly again.\n\nI have always wondered if he ever did pilot or fly again, but I never did get an update. I didn't write down any identifying information, and our city's call center was closed a few months later because travel economy went way, way down as a result of 9/11.",

        "text": "This is a somewhat dramatic, and emotional post. There's no witty banter between me and a customer here. This is also a long and hefty read. \n\nThere are not enough adjectives to describe the awfulness that is working in a call center. I've worked in two different call centers in my life, both for about two years and about a year apart. \n\nThe first, I didn't hate too badly. I got off the phones pretty quickly, and took sup calls, and eventually, only had to chat/IM reps who needed help. I loved that part of the job. I realize I had it pretty easy. \n\nThe rose tinted glasses I looked at my past experience lead me to apply for another call center, the one I'm at now. I've posted here before and have shared experiences, and my sympathy with everyone. \n\nI've since put my 2 week notice in, and this Thursday, the 29th, is my last day. I don't have to explain to you all the joy and relief I feel. Like many before me, work has become a place for extreme anxiety, and panic. I've cried silent tears pulling into the parking lot, filled with immense dread and woe that this was my life. \n\nI've suffered from depression in the past, starting as a teenager, and had gotten it under control. My darkest period was about 6 years ago, and I've felt that I had succeeded in controlling it since then. I took the necessary and logical steps to keep myself sane and healthy. But working here has undone some of my progress. It's such a huge step back, and I finally realized that it's not worth it. No amount of money or job security is worth risking my mental health.\n\n\nThese jobs are not for everyone, and not everyone can do it and stay fully sane. I've gotten backlash from people expressing this. And I know reddit will be no different. I fully admit I'm not mentally strong enough for this, and if you are, bravo. Keep doing it. But I'm strong enough to know when I've reached my limit, and it's been reached. \n\nI love you all very much and feel a kinship with you because we share the same plight. I just hope you know there are alternatives, there are other ways to make a living. It may not pay as much, but you could be happier. Our lives are too precious to spend fretting over the cruel things strangers say to us. \n\nI know for some, they don't feel they have an alternative. It took me awhile, but I found mine. You can't give up looking for a different place to spend your time. If you're going to be spending 40 hours a week somewhere, you shouldn't be in this much mental anguish. I'm not naive, and I'm not a child; I know a job isn't going to be pretty and fun. But I really find these jobs to be cruel and unusual.\n\nThis place I work at in particular, it's not only the customers. It's the entire job.  There's no way to upgrade your job position. Every new opening has been outsourced. So I know I can't level up so to speak and get off the phones.  They keep tightening the metrics until people are getting put on corrective actions, trying to squeeze people out. Prior to the past two months, I was the top on our team for 5 consecutive months, and previously, always in the top 3. I'm good at my job, and I tried hard. But two months ago, they've switched over all of our systems. My computer can't seem to work the new system, so my stats have gone into the toilet. I've asked to switch desks, get a new computer, have IT look at it, etc. But they won't address it. I'm not the only one having this issue, and no adjustment is done to our stats for their faulty software. These past two months I've been in the bottom 10. My history should show that it's not me that's the issue. But guess who gets angry emails regardless? In addition, I missed work quite a bit because my father was sent to the hospital and found out he had stage 3 kidney cancer. He was pretty touch and go for a few weeks. Though I had the sick time to cover my lost pay, I was put on stage 2 corrective action for being gone so much. I'd have to not miss a day from September to April to avoid being terminated. Call centers are cesspools, we all know I'd have the flu before then. I pleaded with my manager given the sudden and severity of the situation, but he said his hands were tied. I also lost the chance to increase my rep status because of this, which means essentially, I lost out on a pay upgrade. My father nearly dying did not forgo the history I've had at my job, and I remain a number to them. My good work does not help me in these times, but my bad work could be held against me for any amount of time for any reason. \n\nMaybe you're the type to roll your eyes and move on call after call. After a night out with your buddies on the weekend, you're able to get back to it. But some of us can't. There are those of us who can't tolerate the onslaught of verbal insults, while trying to smile and not being able to defend yourself. My company even had a meeting a few months back that told us, and I quote,*\"it is not the customer's job to be nice to you. You are not allowed to ask them to remain professional. You do not get to give them warnings and disconnect. If a customer remains confused or irate, you have failed as a customer service representative.\"* This means, I'm not able to ask someone to stop screaming at me, or to stop calling me names, or to stop threatening physical violence (I'm not exaggerating, I checked. Unless they include the location of our center, I can't do anything about it. If they did, I conference a manager in unknowing to the customer and proceed with the call.)\n\nBut for me, I'm out. I'm donesies. I can't do this to myself anymore and I hope if you're in the same position, you're able to leave as well.",

I don't know why I even called, you guys can never fucking fix anything anyway.\" So I already know this is going to be a swell call right off the bat, but I ignore the comment and just go forward with retrieving his customer number by requesting other information. Which he provides, obviously frustrated by his tone of voice. I supply him with his customer number and ask him how I can help. He tells me a client just walked in and he will have to call back. I tell him to supply his customer number when he calls back and anyone who answers can pick up where we left off. \"Why didn't you tell me to write it down! I didn't know I would need it again!\" I give him the number again and he hangs up without saying anything.\n\n\n45 minutes later I get another call and answer exactly as i did before, clearly stating my name. \"Clay (customer number), thank god i got someone else this time the last guy I talked to was a fucking idiot!\" I again ignore the comments and go right in to how i can help him. Its a call regarding a failed software update and it is going to take a while to walk him through backing up his data and re-installing. He of course doesn't know the difference between a right click and left click or what the start menu is, so it will take even longer than normal. But I walk him through most of the steps as nicely as I can, before he again has to go to help a client. I tell him to supply his customer number when he calls back and anyone who answers can pick up where we left off. \"I know, the last idiot told me the same thing.\" He hangs up.\n\n\n20 minutes later I get another call, and as the last two times, i answer with my greeting. \"Thank you for calling (software name) support, my name is Zimzalabim_1...etc.\"  He of course responds \"Thank jesus I got someone new, the last two guys I talked to were fucking idiots!\" I yet again ignore his comments and pick up where we left off.\n\n\n 15 minutes later we have the issue resolved, we just need to reboot his system. \"So, you want me to pull the cord?\", he says. \"What!?! Why would you pull the cord I ask\". \"Because thats how you turn off the computer\" he states. I spend 5 minutes explaining to him why this is a horrible method of shutting down/restarting and walk him through the correct procedure. As the machine reboots his mood picks up and he tells me \"I like you Zimzalabim_1, you aren't as stupid as everyone else there.\" He explains he how he hates computers and that \"They should be used just like women, shoved in a corner and only brought out when you need them.\" I give him a fake chuckle, and after the reboot finishes we verify everything is working. I thank him for calling and before he hangs up he asks \"Zimzalabim_1 can I just ask for you the next time I call?\". \"Sure Clay, go right ahead.\"",

        "text": "I used to work the billing department for a major entertainment company. We had several types of customers. Some we thought we would like, but ended up hating. \n\nThe one type of customer that I actually liked talking to was pot users, or stoners. A lot of times, they would already be stoned before calling, or would take a break during the call to take a bong hit. The reason I liked these customers the most was they were friendly to me, extremely grateful, could hold a conversation, and followed my directions to a T with no question.\n\nThis conversation happened that I still remember as being pleasant. Me will be me, and GT will be Game of Thrones Guy.\n\nMe: Thank you for calling *major company* customer support. My name is PussySharts.\n\nGT: Oh, thanks so much dude. I'm having an issue and Game of Thrones starts in 15 minutes.\n\nMe: How can I help?\n\nGT: My *premium* sub is suspended because of a no good debit card. However, I got myself one of those year membership cards good for one year. I need help like redeeming it.\n\nMe: Let's see how I can help. Can I start with your *account alias*? (he gives it to me, even spells it letter by letter.)\n\nMe: Before I can proceed, I need to validate your account. I see one email and one phone number that I can send the validation code to. I will try the phone number (I click send, then instantly hear his phone message tone.)\n\nGT: I just got a message.\n\nMe: That was me. Open it please.\n\nGT: It just has 5 digits here. \n\nMe: Read those numbers to me. (GT does as told and I validate the account and go to membership info section)\n\nMe: Ah, yes, I see that you owe $19.98 on the account because of the no good debit card, and the account was put into suspension. But you did say you bought a year membership card. Do you have it with you right now?\n\nGT: I am holding onto it right now.\n\nMe: Flip it around and you will see a 25 digit code. \n\nGT: I see it.\n\nMe: Read that code to me 5 digits at a time. \n\n(I access the part of the software that tells me if membership cards are in good standing order. Customer reads me his 25 digit code. I repeat it back to him. Hit search. The code comes back good.)\n\nMe: Good news GT. Your year membership card reads valid and ready for use. I will be able to waive the $19.98 owed and remove the invalid debit card.\n\nGT: Really?! That's awesome dude bro!\n\nMe: Yes it is. However, I need to make some changes in my system and waive the balance before you can redeem the card. For this, I need you to turn your *device* off.\n\nGT: Say no more (hear *device* power off) (I then hear GT take a bong hit)\n\nMe: (making clicks and typing in my system notes. trying to prevent dead air, I decide to make conversation.) So, GT. I understand you like Game of Thrones.\n\nGT: Yeah, it is like a really good show.\n\nMe: I wish I could watch it. I don't have cable though. \n\nGT: Oh man. That is not fun.\n\nMe: I know. I can still watch some TV though. I have always been a Supernatural fan.\n\nGT: I love that show! I love the car dude! I wish I could have one.\n\nMe: Me too. I mostly like the humor. Did you ever see the scene when Castiel sat on the whoopie cushion?\n\nGT: Yeah! I like laughed so hard!\n\nMe: Me too. Anyway, I have finished making changes to your account. Turn your *device* on. (hear device turn on)\n\nGT: (hear loading animation) Whoa! It didn't let me get this far before!\n\nMe: I will help you redeem that year membership card. (I help GT get to where he can redeem the year card). I will just sit here while you enter that code in. Let me know if you need anything.\n\nGT: (took a while. I wonder why. I didn't care. This was a pleasant interaction). It worked.\n\nMe: Cool. Now open your HBO app.\n\nGT: There it is! I can now watch Game of Thrones! Hey guys, dude bro here saved us! We can watch the show now! \n\nMe: I'm glad I could help. I'm not going to take anymore of your time. Thanks for calling *company* customer support. Now go watch Game of Thrones!\n\nGT: Thanks again, dude bro.\n\nOverall call time: roughly 9 minutes\n\nThis was a call I had with a stoner. He was already out there when the call started, and he did take a bong hit in the middle. However, I didn't mind him, because he was nice to me the whole time and actually held a conversation. He also didn't fight me when I told him to do something. \n\nMaybe some of you can relate. I don't know. People like GT are why I sometimes miss the job. He certainly made my night. ",

I'm a university student trying to live a good life, however my job makes it tough. The scheduling is done through IEX, so there are screwups every week on someone's schedule. If a schedule mistake happens, our managers can't even get anything overriden- the Scheduling team takes care of that stuff even if your schedule preferences say you are in class and can't work a certain day. Anyway. \n\nWe have an ACW cap of 15 seconds, our AHT cannot exceed 700 seconds (which if you work in an inbound call center you'll know is unrealistic because of the script following and when you ask \"anything else I can help you with\", the customer always has other accounts they want you to look into or other shit they want you to deal with.\nWe have a deact % of under 10% we have to maintain to keep our jobs, too. This used to be 25% not even a year ago.\n\nI've been there for a year now, and it's awful. When I'm there I feel burnt out before my shift begins. My manager and I don't see eye to eye. If I want to help a customer he doesn't let me. Our price plans suck, our ISPR offers suck, and loyalty means nothing where I work as per management- if you try and adjust over $150 even after taxes for someone with an ARPU of $120 who's been with the company for 20 years, you get written up or terminated.\n\nWe outsourced to the Philippines and Spain or Mexico or something now too. Worst idea ever, Hell Mobility. Those reps avoid taking deacts and cold transfer to us, so we have to cancel those lines and our customers are confused why they were transferred (and now irate) and we have to run the risk of being put on an improvement program or termination due to other agents being too lazy to do their job and take the cancellation? \n\nI want to destroy the near-entirety of you Philippene call center employees.

Here are the usual responses, (and what I would really like to tell them).\n\n*long loud sigh* \"This is fucking ridiculous/unbelievable/bullshit/outrageous.\" \n(the fact that you can't go ~48 without television, and now you have to rent a hotel room to get your fix?)\n\n\"I can't believe you install new customer before taking care of current ones\" \n(There's no possible way of me telling what the previous appointments are for. Maybe they're solving other customers' technical issues who didn't troubleshoot with us either)\n\n\"By the time your tech comes out, [insert competitor] cable will already be installed here, they care about their customers\"\n(I\"m sure you're right. because [competitor] fucking sucks, they lost all their customers, so there's appointments open for days.)\n\n\"I own a service company, and help my customers the same day of the call!!\"\n(Great! So your little hometown company serves tens of millions of subscribers nationwide as well!! So you definitely understand why we can't send out a tech within 30 minutes of now.)\n\nMy absolute favorite...\n\n\"If the technician isn't here tomorrow morning, all of your equipment is going in my yard and you can come pick your shit up oSmurfed!\"\n(Awesome! I'll be sure to send you the cancellation bill in the mail, which will include the cost of the equipment you ruined. I hope it sits in your yard for weeks while you start to realize your ignorance/stupidity)\n\nMe: Have a great weekend!\nCustomer: \"Yeah right, without any fucking telivision!!\" \n(Well sir, we could simply solve this over the phone in just a minute, we just need to press the input button on your remote) \n\"Fuck that, this isn't my job *click*\"\n\nOn a serious note.. I definitely understand why people would be upset about this. But come on, we take the downtime days off your bill.. and the appointment delays usually aren't that bad at all. If anyone has some serious non-sarcastic replies I could use for these customers, I'm all ears. I'm not that good with handling objections, I usually just apologize/empathize.",

My object of frustration is at my help desk...or should I say Derp Desk. That company that hired me out for green and white initially started a merger when I was hired. They shall be un-named but the merging was essentially to be one company that specialized in outsourcing and the other collections.\n\nBasically outsourcing has two other locations in the states and latin america....my derp desk treats these locations far better than mine. Even our credit department expressed favoritism to the two other locations than mine.\n\nPoint is when I call in Derp Desk doesnt wish to do their job. Even at the expense of their customers. Last night I had a really sucky move order. Every time I keyed it for days out it would cut the services off that very instant. I didn't why I assumed the bundle the customer had was old and therefore glitched. However we now have a new rule we can't rebundle unlessthe customer buys something which meant services must remain as is....long story short it took 4 calls to them to have the issue fixed. I was hung up on was having someone to tell me be quiet...our customer suffered inconvenience.\n Derp Desk you suck.",

I know I'm not listed on the account but I want to keep asking for 6 minutes. \n* My services are off. Could you please present me with all of my bills, calls, letters and notices for the last 3 months? \"Well damn, I thought I paid it.\"\n* Can I speak to Sharon?  It's very important that I speak to Sharon she's been working on my account. (3 minutes later) *\"Sorry Sharon is on a call, I can send her an email to call you back.* Oh well, I just need to know my balance. \n* I've been getting bills at my address and I just want to call to make sure they are going to my address. \n* My bill says **AUTO PAY - DO NOT PAY** am I on auto pay? Should I pay this?\n* I've been to 3 websites in my entire life. Here are my thoughts on your design, UI, site friendliness and payment processor. \n* In 20 questions or less can you get me to say I have a hearing problem?\n* Instead of just not paying it, I thought it would be best to call you and tell you I'm not paying it.\n* Hey I know there's an outage affecting every house around me but why aren't my services working?

I'm not even living there! You need to send somebody out to fix the meter.\n&gt; \n&gt; O: Yes Ma'am, I understand your frustration but let's walk through a few possibilities first.\n&gt; \n&gt; C: There are NO possibilities other than you not reading it right I have never had a bill like this in 10 years Nothing is broken. Nothing is leaking. \n&gt; \n&gt; O: Well, you said you aren't living there right now. Do you have someone who checks on the house?

SEND HIM AGAIN OR I'M CONTACT THE LOCAL NEWS STATION\n&gt; \n&gt; O: I would strongly advise that you have someone check the inside of the house. 90,000 gallons of water is a large amount and unfortunately we would have to charge you to send our tech out again because he was just there 3 days ago.\n&gt; \n&gt; C: That's a load of shit I'm not paying this bill!!!

No call no letter no check up ... nothing\n&gt; \n&gt; O: I'm sorry to hear that. I need your address and name to verify your info\n\n&gt; &lt;gives me account info&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; O: So what happened exactly?\n&gt; \n&gt; C: I come home.... my house is ruined. A pipe burst in the bathroom. Everything I have is ruined and the entire house has to be redone. You people have done nothing. No notification. You people don't think to check if it says I have 100,000 gallons of water at my house.\n&gt; \n&gt; O: Yes, actually I spoke to you back on &lt;date&gt; and I did urge you to have someone check inside the house. We had already sent out tech out to check the meter and it was fine. There was nothing further we could do from our end. \n&gt; \n&gt; C: So you're trying to say it's MY FAULT THIS HAPPENED?\n&gt; \n&gt; O: No, no, not at all. It was not your fault that a pipe burst but our responsibility is the meter. These things happen and unfortunately it is the homeowners responsibility.  \n&gt; \n&gt; C: How come no one called me and told me my house was being flooded? You don't think to look at all around and in the windows??? You would have seen all the water. \n&gt; \n&gt; O: Our tech can only check the meter and survey what he can see from the street. He also did try to call you actually and he left a voicemail on &lt;date&gt;.\n&gt; \n&gt; C: Yeah well I didn't get it and now I'm stuck with this bill\n&gt; \n&gt; O: Yes, unfortunately the charges would be owed if it is a customer side leak.\n&gt;\n&gt;C: &lt;responds with silence&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;O: I can get you to my supervisor but they aren't going to be able to do much more than I did. \n\n&gt; C: &lt;responds with silence again&gt;\n\n&gt;O: Ma'am are you still there?\n\n&gt; C: Yeah... ha...I'm not paying this bill \n&gt;&lt;customer hangs up&gt;\n",

(why would we give account numbers if you don't fucking need them to access your account?)    \nCaller: Fuck sake, it's James, JAMES FUCKING SMITH.    \nMe: Ok thanks James F Smith. *I just said the F, not the whole word obviously*    \nCaller: Fuck Yo-   \n*placed on hold*   \nMe: *finds a manager*   \nManager: What do you want?     \nMe: Manager call for you, he can't provide his account details with us.    \nManager: Have you tried asking for his online login number?    \nMe: Yes    \nManager: Have you asked him to find his statements for you?    \nMe: He's driving    \nManager: Well i can't help him, tell him i can't do anything for him.    \nMe: I've already informed him of your role here, you manage me and not the customers.    \nManager: Tell him again and offer to put him through to his business manager.    \nMe: But i don't know who his business manager is, i don't have his account number to locate that.    \nManager: For God sake, just put him through.    \nMe: Ok, whats the number to dial?    \nManager: You should know it already.    \nMe: We change desks all the time, i can't memorise an 8 digit number that i use once every 2 days which changes all the time     \nManager: whatever it's 12345678    \nMe: Hello Mr Smith, i have Jim ready to speak to you.     \nCustomer: I can't be fucking bothered you took too long, put me through to another agent.    \nMe: Ok, but they will require your account details.    \nCustomer: FUCKING PUT ME THROUGH TO SOMEONE WHO CAN DO HIS FUCKING JOB.    \nMe: Ok thank you for your call.    \n     \n*Transferred*     \n    \nYeah....this is daily at the very least average i get one of these hourly, not always asking for a manager, usually they'll run off to find a statement.    \n    \nProtip.    \nYOU'RE CALLING ME, HOW CAN YOU BE SURPRISED THAT I NEED YOUR DETAILS?    \n    \nAnother one i hate     \nCustomer: \"hi whats my balance\"    \nMe: \"It's 802.93\"    \nCustomer: \"Wait i need a pen\"    \n*searches thoroughly for a pen*    \nCustomer: \"Sorry, you can never find a pen when you need one\"    \nMe: *puts on mute* Fucking jackass calls me for a balance but doesn't have a fucking pen ready, AS IF HE'S SURPRISED THAT I'M GIVING HIM HIS BALANCE THAT HE ASKED FOR. *Off mute* so have you found a pen Mr Jones?    \nCustomer: No i'll call back later.    \n    \n......    \nyeah.    \n    \nI don't work for a call centre anymore, i got a promotion.",

It's one of those TV networks that shows jewelry and stuff and markets to old people to swindle them out of their retirement money. It's not glamorous, but it pays the bills. Anyway, I had this call.\n\n**Me:** Hello and thank you for calling (Network), my name is /u/crunchym8 , are you calling to place an order today?\n\n**C:** (Foreign accent) Yes, I like Item Number #######\n\n**Me:** The green fluorite ring in nickel-free sterling silver?\n\n**C:** Yes, that.\n\n**Me:** Alright, I'll be more than happy to assist you with this order today. In what size would you like this item?\n\n**C:** Ten and half.\n\n(Our channel does not stock half sizes for the most part, and they're not offered. This is a red flag to me when people ask, especially if they have a foreign accent- it usually means they have the wrong number.)\n\n**Me:** I'm sorry, we don't offer half sizes. The largest we have this ring is a size ten.\n\n**C:** (Quiet)\n\n**Me:** Caller are you there?\n\n**C:** Why you offer size ten half when you no have ten half?\n\n**Me:** We don't offer it in-\n\n**C:** YOU HAVE ON TV SIZE TEN HALF MEENT FLUOR RING I SEE RIGHT NOW (At this point she's rolling her R's ferociously, like trying to growl and speak at the same time. I fear an attack on my life by the RussianChineseAfrican mafia.)\n\n**Me:** Ma'am, I'm looking at the screen- It stops at size ten. It's the largest size we offer-\n\n**C:** WHY YOU LIE\n\n**Me, Exasperated:** Ma'am, I'm *not lying* to you. Are you sure you're on the right channel?\n\n**C:** WHY YOU NO MAKE TEN HALF FOR ME\n\n**Me:** Because-\n\n**C:** Customer always right, you make size ten half for me, yes?\n\n**Me:** We can't-\n\n**C:** MANAGER NOW YOU STUPID\n\nAfterwards I pull my manager off the floor to speak to her. I sit next to my manager and listen in through a buddyjack, and she is screaming her head off. My manager just has this look of stoic disappointment on his face- Upset that he's dealing with this woman. At the end of the foreign screaming, he just said \"I'm sorry, there's nothing we can do.\" Another short screaming fit and my manager then said \"Ma'am, we cannot do anything. If you keep screaming, I'm going to disconnect the call.\n\nThe customer was quiet for a moment, then went off on a tirade about how our channel constantly frauds her and lies and is terrible, and how she's gonna call the better business bureau (though because of her accent it sounded like she was saying butter beeswax boro), slowly raising her voice until we heard dogs barking in the background.\n\n\"Due to the nature of this call, agent is disconnecting.\" With that, my manager disconnected the call. Thankfully, if she called back, I didn't get her. ",

        "text": "I figured since I am no longer working my company that I would share some random stories with you. I worked for a console/gaming portion of a company. This was one of my worst calls.\n\nA younger man called in about his console being stolen.  He had left his house for about 30 minutes to go to the store, left his sister in charge of the house (he lived in a bad area) and came back to JUST his console stolen plus the sister gone.  He was rightfully angry, and knew exactly who had stolen it (supposedly his sister).  He had already called the police and they were on their way to the residence.  He spoke a lot about how he is the only GOOD person in his family, and how unjust it was that they were doing this to him.  He also warned me about ever going to his area, as it is a terrible place to live.\n\nWhile I was walking him through how to protect his account, and removing all financial/identifying information from it.  The sister came back (she apparently lived down the street), after she realized he had called the police (I assumed word traveled fast).  This is when the yelling and flipping out started.\n\nAt some point during the yelling, and her denials, this gem slipped out: \"I have 3 kids to feed!  I sold the console to my ex-boyfriend for $100!!!  I need to take care of my family!!  You need to feel bad for me!\"  Those were her exact words...she wanted her brother to feel bad for her for stealing his stuff and selling it.  Mind you: this particular console was basically brand new and worth around $400, addon the hundreds of games he had purchased..it was easily around $2k he was losing.  But his main concern was for his daughter, she couldn't play the games anymore and it was going to break her heart (yes, it was mostly kid-like games on the account).  So, she fully accepted responsibility for it.  I reminded him once again that all calls were recorded, as a hint for when the police showed up and he pressed charges...well, now he has proof that she took it.  She even admitted that her ex-boyfriend was a drug dealer and he was REALLY angry that she had sold it to this guy.\n\nBut, the yelling.  It was so loud that I removed my headset off of my head several times for 10 minutes or more.  The sister was VERY loud.  She also kept leaving and storming back into the house.  So, when you'd think you had a few moments of peace to get back to what you were doing...nope, here comes the sister from down the street again.\n\nHe told me numerous times that he was very sorry for what was happening.  He stated about 100 times that he did NOT want any form of refund, at all.  He just wants to make sure that in our system it is listed as stolen.  I went above and beyond to make sure his account was completely secure.\n\nAt the end of the call, I realized my TL was actually listening to it and thought it was a scam.  I was constantly being informed to disconnect the call.  It was not a scam and no I wasn't hanging up on this poor guy until it was fixed as much as I possibly could.  The police showed up right at the end, and I informed him to please make a report with them.\n\nThis was the day I realized I REALLY hate yelling, but that I override my own feelings due to my sympathy for callers.  Any other agent would have disconnected the call as soon as their notes were logged in.  I made sure to go above and beyond for him.  I even gave him some additional tips in my email to him, that I made sure he knew to read....when his sister wasn't randomly coming into his house.\n\nHe wound up giving me a kudos after the call, and an awesome survey.  He did eventually email me back and let me know that after filing a police report, the sister brought the console back and all charges were dropped.  His daughter was now playing her games again.  He is also planning on moving very soon, as this isn't the type of environment he wants his daughter to be in.\n\nPS.  The sister threatened to shoot me, when she found out who I was on the phone.  Yeah, good idea...threaten to shoot the agent on the phone because YOU stole something.  I was just trying to protect the account owner, btu the minute she found out who I was...it was like all sanity went out of the window and was personally blaming me for HER stealing it.  The logic in that is just...wow..",

        "text": "I figured since I am no longer working my company that I would share some random stories with you.  I call them gems, as they are either par for the course or completely out there... I worked for a console/gaming portion of a company.  Here's a few stories that I thought I'd share with you all.  They are shortened for the sake of length, and because some details fail me after so long.\n\n\n\n**Story 1:**\n\nAround 6 pm, I received a call from a super happy woman on the phone.  Our queue times were down to about a 2 minute wait.  She was upset that her console was not working correctly.\n\nHer: \"Yeah, my console is not working and I need you to fix it.\"\n\nMe: \"Okay, can you please turn off the console and unplug it from the wall for 3 minutes?\"\n\nHer: \"Well, I'm actually going number 2 right now.  I figured I'd just call and ask what all you could do.\"\n\nMe: \"I cannot fix the problem you are having or assist you without you being in the same room as the console.  Is it possible for you to do it soon?\"\n\nHer: \"No, I'm at work and I'm going to the bathroom.  I just figured I'd call.  Thanks.\"  -click-\n\nOkay....she basically called me while in the bathroom take a shit, wanted to know IF we could do anything about it, and then hung up on me.  I could even hear her flush.  I giggled.  (I've also had a woman call me because she apparently NEEDED someone to talk to her while she went to the bathroom, or else she couldn't go.  That was interesting...and I'm still not sure why she called ME.)\n\n\n\n**Story 2:**\n\nAngry mother that she is being charged a recurring fee for $9.99.  She has been charged this recurring fee for over a year and knew it.  I informed her of what the charge was for.\n\nHer: \"Yes, I know exactly what it is for you brainless idiot!  I don't want to pay for it!  He hasn't even used console and has been grounded for a week!\"\n\nMe: \"Ma'am, this charge was posted to your bank account over 3 weeks ago and went through a long time ago.  I understand he has not used the console, but at this time I cannot refund the charge for you.  I can easily walk you through making sure it does not ever charge you again.  This way, it never happens again and you can have more control over your account.\"\n\nHer: \"I don't care about it charging again!  I care it about this month!!!?!?!?!! **I know $9.99 is not a lot of money for someone like you, but it is a LOT of money for me!**\"\n\nMe: \"Oh, it is a lot of money.  I completely agree with that.  I cannot issue a refund on this charge though.  It's not possible at all.\" (Meanwhile, I was making my demoted $8.75 per hour...so yeah, it was a lot of money for me.  I really couldn't issue the refund, though.)\n\nHer: \"MAKE THE SYSTEM REFUND ME!  YOU ARE HUMAN AND SMARTER THAN A COMPUTER!  YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO CONTROL IT!\"  (Actually, not how any of this works...it tells me no, it means no.  Apparently, you DO know I am a human but still feel the need to treat me like crap.  Awesome.)\n\nMe: \"Ma'am, that is not how my system works.  The entire refund is completely greyed out and there is no option to refund it.  If I could refund you, I would be more than happy to refund you.  But, there is no option for me to do so.\"\n\nHer: \"You're a bunch of scammers!!!!!\"  -click-\n\nMind you, she knew she was going to charged this amount and just didn't want to pay it the one time.  No, I cannot physically break my computer in order to refund you an out of policy refund.  She also didn't want to turn off the recurring charge....she wanted to keep her service charging, but just not on the months/weeks she had to punish her kid.  Not.my.responsibility.\n\n\n\n**Story 3:**\n\nAn older gentlemen called in late at night for a password issue.  It's a simple fix, IF they access to the internet.  He actually called in screaming and cursing at me so bad that I almost hung up.  He had been hung up on several times before getting to me (bad sign, means he is an abusive customer).  I let my sympathy get the better of me, and continued with the call after getting my TL to listen in with me.  TL told me to disconnect the call, but I charged forwards and decided to help instead.  After about 45 minutes of cursing, threats, and insults...this is what happened.\n\nHim: \"I pay good money to play my games when I want to!  All you people are doing is making me REALLY angry right now!!!  I just want to play my games that I was playing yesterday!!!!\" (Note: last time accessed account was over 3 months ago, and has not used since.  He reset his password on his computer 3 months ago, and simply forgot what it was.)\n\nMe: \"Well, I can walk you through resetting your password if you'd like.\"\n\nHim: \"NO!  YOU need to reset my password for me!  I don't have any internet here!  I am disabled and get government assistance for it!  Your company is biased against the disabled!  I am in a wheelchair, god damn it.  -insert more cursing and flipping out-\"\n\nMe: \"I assure that our company does not hate the disabled.  Do you have the option on your phone to check websites?\"\n\nHim: \"I am on my prepaid phone, but you don't care!  You are just racking up my minutes with this call!  I don't have a computer!!!!  I AM ON A FIXED INCOME!\"\n\nMe: \"Oh, so you don't have a computer and no way to access the internet?  How does your console connect to the internet?  We can try to browse the internet with (my company's browser) on your console.\"\n\nHim: \"Well, I have internet but I'm not turning on my (Fruit Computer) to let you load it up with viruses!  That's all your company does, load viruses onto things and spy on me!  I'm not using (My Company's broswer) to look things up!!!\" (Insert another rant about how terrible my company is...that MAKES his console.  I don't think he knew my company actually makes his console...)\n\nMe: \"Well, what I can do is email you the exact instructions on how to reset your password.\"\n\nHim: \"You bitch!  I'm loading up my (Fruit Computer) right now.  You WILL stay on the phone with me until this is fixed.\"\n\nIt took 30 minutes of waiting, with him raging and flipping out while his computer loaded.  Then it said: \"Error: No internet access.\"  Somehow he eventually fixed his internet and was walking him through resetting his password when he started flipping out again about how he shouldn't NEED a password to access his services.  (\"Sir, it is for your protection and a federal law that requires us to keep your account secure.  This is strictly to make sure your financial information is not used inappropriately\")  I sent him an email with direct instructions on how to reset his password.  He cursed and flipped out so bad that I was forced to hang up on him.\n\nHe originally stated he didn't have internet, but he did on his console.  Then he stated he was in a wheelchair, but this later changed to not a wheelchair just back pain.  He also said he didn't have a computer, but later this was a Fruit Computer only.  The lies coming out of his mouth was insane.  This was after 3 hours of my putting up with his ranting, and he STILL wasn't happy.\n\n\n\n**Story 4:**\n\nA younger mom called in to our tech support line.  She claimed to have 6 kids, was driving at the time, none of her baby's daddy's pays child support.  Each kid has an ADULT account.  Last week, she knew that her child had racked up tons of charges on one of the ADULT accounts (this is illegal for those of you wondering, you MUST enter in the correct birthday when creating an account).  She refused all forms of child security protections so this would not happen again.  It is within policy that we NEVER refund this type of transaction more than once per year, it just so happened to be on the SAME EXACT account as the previous week.  There are times when I let my sympathy for the person override my judgement.  I should hang up on these people as soon as they start cursing, but...meh.  I wanted to help.\n\nHer: \"You are just trying to scam us poor folk!  If your company charges everyone $9 illegally on all your accounts (this is our standard monthly fee), then your company is scamming millions of people out of their money!  You are just trying to keep us poor people poor!\"\n\nMe: \"My company is not trying to scam people out of their money, if you just give me one second I will look into all of these charges more for you.\" (I looked previously, but not allowed to put people on hold.  She had rented a lot of movies on her console, watched them, and now wanted a refund.  It's a common scam.)\n\nHer: \"You white people always trying to keep the black people down!  You are racist!!!!!\" (Rant rant rant)\n\nMe: \"I am not trying to do that, I am looking into your issue a little bit more and will see what all I can do for you.  I assure you that I am not racist, I am trying to help you.\"\n\nHer: Random insults and flipping out because was not refunded immediately upon calling me. -slams car door- \"I almost got into an accident because you made me so damn upset!\"\n\nMe: \"I do suggest not driving while on the phone with me, as it can be very dangerous and illegal in some states.\"\n\nHer: \"You aren't trying to help me at all, fucking nasty ass cunt! You just want my moneyyyyy!!!!!\" More insults, cursing, etc.\n\nMe: Starting to downscript \"At this time, I would really like to help you but if you continue in that form of speech, I will have to terminate this call.  Please try to remain professional.\"\n\nHer: \"Don't tell me what to do yadda yadda cursing yadda yadda your company sucks! I will come to your store and murder all of you!  I know people!\" - click-\n\nIn general, this call shook me the most.  I was more than willing to try to help her but she wasn't having any of it.  I was also shaken by her blatant disregard for the way she was speaking to me.\n\n\n\n\n**Random Goodness:**\n\nHad a soccer mom who was about half drunk.  Her son had accidentally bought GTA V.  She was angry.  We had a nice chat about kids these days, and how my own daughter charged up $600 on that minion rush game (Not nearly that bad, but I exaggerated so people didn't feel like this ONLY happens to them.  It was more like $30).  I refunded the price of the game, and advised her that it would be removed off of the system - never to be played again (unless repurchased).  By the end of the call she was escatic that she could \"control the world\" with parental controls (my code phrase), tons of passwords/passkeys, etc.  Her son, was NOT so happy.  He had been previously trying to remove some controls immediately after putting them on there, so badly that she had to lock him out of the room while on the phone with me.  It took 4 hours, but I got her entire console set up to be locked and protected until that kid turns 18.  She now had full control over everything and was REALLY happy that I had walked her through everything.  At the end of the call, she was giggling - she was THAT happy.  Her son, was throwing things as he couldn't figure out how to remove the protections I had put on there.  I outwitted her 13 year old son and she was loving every minute of it.  This was an awesome call.  (He had originally charged close to $250.  I refunded around $200 of it, within our policies.  She allowed him to keep ONE game...but the rest was immediately returned.  Apparently, his friends had been helping him remove parental controls over time.  So he KNEW how to do remove them, etc.)\n\nSide note:  For those wondering, I do not work there anymore.  See my previous post on this.",

        "text": "I had a panic attack in work a couple of weeks ago while I wasn't even on the phone, and got prescribed some meds but they didn't really work for me. I ended up calling in sick on Friday and today and called the doctors again. I guess being shouted at for 40 hours a week by ungrateful people has taken it's toll on my mental health.\n\nI explained that work is contributing significantly to my anxiety and she offered to give me a sick note so I can take the next couple of weeks off while I wait for the new meds to kick in! I have an appointment with them on Thursday to see if there's anything else they can do to help me but honestly, I just need some time away from this place and possibly to find a new job in the process.\n\n So while my managers must be quite pissed at me for taking time off in a busy period, I plan to use this time to relax and re-evaluate whether I need to continue with a job that's caused me to sign off on sick leave because of anxiety at 24.",

        "text": "I'm sure some of you saw my most recent post.  For those that don't know: https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/3mxsxw/i_hate_surveys/\n\nAnyways, I did wind up calling the US Department of Labor on my company.  Apparently, I am not the first person to call in.  They couldn't tell me much on the phone, but there have been hundreds of complaints over the last month or two.  I kept my \"report\" anonymous.\n\nAlso, that supervisor that I was trying to get transferred to?  Yeah, if you check the comments...originally I was told my current Team Leader needed to sign off permission.  This was true, and he denied me permission to switch teams.  Then he warned me not to try to do it \"behind his back\", as he was watching me (creepy, but he was always watching me...whatever).  It's also true that my original Team Leader actually sent in the other supervisor in for review.  The awesome supervisor has now magically gotten a few really low QAs (when he hasn't taken calls in months) and has been demoted.  It is not beyond my stretch of imagination to know that awesome supervisor was thrown under the bus by my jackass Team Leader.  Jackass TL is actually a co-TL of our QA team.  So, I'm really not surprised.  Just one of his many asshole talents and most likely due to asshole having a massive ego.  He probably felt threatened by the awesome one or some such bullshit.\n\nRemember how my TL jumped on the ball to try to get that survey removed?  Yup.  Confirmed.  He didn't even try.  Fuck that guy.  You CAN have a survey fixed, but they didn't even attempt to fix it.  There's SO much hate right now for that company/TL.\n\nYes, I did write in the comments that my TL basically threatened me and stated the company I worked for has bigger/deeper pockets than I do.  Yes, he did say that to myself and several other people.  He said it so often, that I actually took advice from this subreddit and screenshotted it to myself.  I sent that little gem in too.  Mainly because, fuck that guy.\n\nThere is all of 1 person left on my original team now.  She is in constant contact with me daily.  We originally started with 50 agents on our team, now asshole is stuck with just one.  Original TL is actually trying to run her off, mostly via bullying and ripping her off the phones (which they don't pay for, but should - it was part of my report).  She would quit too, if she didn't need the job so bad.  Her pay has also been reduced.\n\nIt's in the wind that there has been several lawsuits brought against the company I worked for.  Another one is gearing up.  I'm not getting involved.  I told everyone to keep me out of it.\n\nThis is basically what happened since my original post:  I called out a day, once in the 4 years total I worked for this company.  I missed a team meeting.  My asshole TL was talking trash about myself and basically everyone on his team.  I decided enough was enough.  It was recorded and passed along to me.  Maybe you shouldn't be talking crap about your agents!  I sent that recording to the government, too.  They were appalled at how he was speaking about us.  As soon as the recording was spread throughout the team, people that were on the fence of quitting completely abandoned ship.\n\nI quit the next day.  Straight up quit via email.  Didn't try to call them, just wrote a super professional email quitting.  I didn't report my TL for some of the things he did, but I was really tempted to do so.  I still haven't even sent in my work computer back to them.  They didn't give me a shipping label, so I'm making them try to hunt it down or resend a shipping label to me (not sure where to even send it).  I don't want/need it, but it's just another way for me to basically tell them I'm not doing more work for them when I'm not getting paid for it.\n\nMy husband is currently working.  He's loving it.  He likes working from home.  It does have it's benefits.  I liked working from home, too.  It does also have it's downfalls, but nowhere near what I was dealing with.  I'm just happy I don't have to listen to people screaming at me for 1/2 a fucking penny anymore.  Seriously, I will NEVER work in a call center EVER again.  Fuck your half a penny, fuck you for wasting so much of my time explaining to you that it's not even a whole damn penny. It costs MORE to call me to scream at me, than 1/2 a penny!  (I usually only take about 35 calls a day.  This day though, I stopped counting after the 127th caller screaming at me for their 1/2 a penny.  Yes, that many people called to scream at me personally for 1/2 a penny.  That they KNEW we couldn't refund, but just wanted to WAIT in our queue for over an hour.  The total calls that day taken was around 15,000...with an automated message stating multiple times that our servers were down for ONE hour and we cannot refund. It says it on their actual service, down for maintenance and cannot refund with a time frame.  It says it on our website.  It says it EVERYWHERE!  But, they had to scream at someone for a refund, so they waited in queue!  Seriously?!)\n\nAs per me?  My faith in humanity died the day of our servers going down.  I still hate (most) people and refuse to interact with even family members now until I can get over my general hatred of entitlement.  I don't answer the phone, at all.  I spend as much time with my kids and husband as I possibly can.  I'm just not the type to NOT work, though, so I'm sure I will be looking into doing some part time work in my original field (not around people!).\n\nIt's times like this, that I'm so happy I live in the middle of nowhere on 50 acres.  Downvote away, but I'm so damn happy right now...especially after that whole 1/2 a penny bullshit.  Seriously, I just hate people now and it will take me a LONG time to get over that feeling.  It is NEVER okay to scream at an agent on the phone, especially over a half a fucking penny.",

        "text": "So this is my first call center job.  I work for a large retail pharmacy, in their tech support call center.  I take calls from stores on issues ranging from basic hardware installation to insurance rejections.  At our center, we are monitored on after-call instead of average handling.\n\nThis has caused me quite an issue.  As I close in on a year at the center, I find myself unable to improve my AWT.  I'm nowhere near the goal of 100s, but my AHT is a full minute under goal (90s under site average).  Of course, AWT is all that matters and I've found myself unable to change my approach to calls.\n\nI get all the information I need from the caller and provide the resolution information.  Sometimes I can document while on the call, if there's enough downtime (while having the employee troubleshoot), but often enough, it's just a bunch of bullshit I need to fill out for second-level vendors.  I know I'm supposed to change my pace and delay the end of my call in order to buy time for documentation, but it just goes against my nature.  It's inefficient.  I get the info I need, and terminate contact with the store once sufficient information is provided.  Why would I waste their time keeping them on the line?  Isn't it more costly to keep them on the line, paying both them and me when the corporation could just be paying me?\n\nI can't reconcile this in my head, and I'm about to face disciplinary action.  I'm consistently been one of the top agents in the call center by every other metric over my year, but since I have not improved my AWT I face dismissal.  I think I'm just not cut out for this shit.",

I've learned how to talk to people by learning how to NOT talk to people. When I call customer service I don't yell, I'm not rude, I'm not demanding. I can be upset but still not be a piece of shit. I may be upset at the company but I realize that the rep is not the company. The rep is probably my only friend. They can't always help you but they certainly are going to check out mentally and do as little as possible for you if you start yelling and being a shithead.\n\nI usually follow an outline like this:\n\n- The first thing I ask is \"Hi, what do you need to verify my account?\"\n- Be honest.\n- Inquire, rather than demand and yell. \n- Ask direct questions that let the rep utilize the fact that they get asked the same thing 100 times a day and know the shortcuts. E.x. What's the easiest way to get on autopay? \n\nI called up my bank and said \"I've accidentally overdrawn my account by $200 by setting this account up for autopay elsewhere. I really didn't mean to do it and I haven't used the account for 6 months as you can see from the history. Could you please do anything about removing some of the fees?\"\n\nShe herself couldn't remove the fees, but since I wasn't a flaming asshole and honest, she told me exactly who to ask for in my local branch. I made a quick visit, and said Sandra said to mention that I spoke to her at the call center about these fees. Bam, $150.00 of fee's removed.  The bank manager then personally called me the next day to verify that the account was paid up and closed now. \n\nWe all know how this could have easily been a no if I called and \"You FUCKING PEOPLE. OH MY GOD. You've screwed my account up so bad I'm going to sue you if you don't fix it. These fee's better be removed RIGHT NOW. Is this how you treat customers???? .\" \n\nThe rep would just check out mentally and say you fuck you and have a nice day. \n\nI'm absolutely convinced that 95% of bad customer service experiences are not the company/rep but rather the customer. When they ask for unrealistic shit in stupid ways they don't get the answer they want. Therefore XYZ company sucks and I'm giving them a 1 star or complain on Facebook.",

Player is trying to inquire on lifting a suspension on one of his accounts. I thought it was just a run of the mill inquiries. Boy was I wrong. I checked his previous correspondences and found that he was already in contact with a few of my colleagues before. Basically he was banned for hacking another account. His excuse was that his friend shared his account to him so that he can use it while his friend was in school. I then proceeded to check the account. Turns out the real reason the user was suspended is because he hacked an employee's personal account. Basically he's SOL and I laughed making a reply to his inquiry.",

It was you he spoke to!\n\n&gt;At this point, I have their details up. Yep. It was me your husband spoke to. Yep. I did cancel it. For the end of your minimum contractual phase. Look I've even got the exact second I pressed \"cancel\".\n\nM: Yep, okay. Get your husband to call in and we can look into it.\n\nC: THERE IS NOTHING TO LOOK INTO!! YOU HAVEN'T DONE YOUR JOB!!! \n\nShe then hung up.\n\nIt took every part of me not to break the law and tell her the exact time down to the second I canceled their account and I use the same spiel of \"your service continues until this date, no further billing will occur after said date\".\n\nMan, I hope her husband gets me on the phone.",

This call just happened yesterday, so it's still very fresh in my mind.  \n\nAn agent called from the main office number so of course name doesn't come up on my screen, but instead it was the realtor's name that owns the company.  Not a big deal, the first question asked for all in bound calls asks for the person's name.  It's Theresa something or other, but since it's not on my screen I ask if Theresa is spelled \"Theresa\" or \"Teresa\".  This is where she lost her shit.  \n\n\"IT DOESN'T MATTER!! JUST MAKE MY APPOINTMENT!!\"  \nMe \"Ma'am, I have to have your name first..\"  \n\"NO YOU DON'T! YOU JUST GO TO THE APPOINTMENT!\"  \nI wasn't having this, she wasn't going to let me get anywhere so I simply said \"One moment\" and just transferred the lunatic to a supervisor.  I get a lot of nut cases daily, but this lady was just off her rocker from the get go. ",

I know you don't call yourself or send letters you fucktard but you this is not a new thing that call centers ask this. \n\n2. Trailing off mid sentence without asking an actual question.  Most my job is asking what the fuck are you asking because you're too dumb to form a question. \n\n3. Take zero responsiblity for not paying your bills. You didn't get any bills for the last two months? You didn't get the emails, phone calls or shut off notice on your house? Fuck off\n\n4. Request extensions for fucking 3 weeks from now and you're not even meeting the past due payment. Your last payment was 45 days ago and we are shutting it off tomorrow. You have the gall to ask for an extension and then demand my supervisor when I say no?\n\n5. Throw underhanded insults that aren't even midly accurate. \"I know your system has issues with me making payments with my bank account\". No it doesn't, you're an idiot and you can't press a sequence of numbers on a phone. \n\n6. Say you're going to file a complaint or call a lawyer. You can afford a lawyer but you can't afford your fucking $60 bill? \n\n",

And this repeates. \n\nNaturally I assume this is her voice mail so I let it go for about 5 screaming \"Hello Jesus loves you!\"s. At this point I was expecting the good ole beep of a vm but nothing... So I just say \"umm hello?\" The screaming stops. I get one more \"Jesus loves you\" and then she hung up. One of the strangest encounters I have had in my one fantastic year in a call center. \n\nAlso, just found this sub while losing my mind at work. Perfect timing.",

But in my two and a half years working here, I can safely say this is the most \nWTF call I've ever taken:\n\nA self-proclaimed \"kick-ass woman\" who calls herself the \"Fireball from Montreal,\" who at some point has escaped the Mormon cult by leaving her abusive criminal ex-husband (whom she has 2 kids with but the courts wouldn't give her custody of them because she's \"normal\", and are now both criminals since living with their father), owes nearly $600 on an auto repair bill that she can't afford because the county commissioner kicked her out of her townhouse (which should have been declared a crime scene anyway; there was evidence in her roof that showed she could have died of asphyxiation from gasoline, but the judge wouldn't approve the investigation). She tried calling 8 different churches to help with her auto repair bill, but no help from the supposed hands and feet of Jesus Christ. She tried calling 211, some sort of \"community help\" line, but they of course have a bias towards active military and don't give a shit about Canadians. But she sure feels like a soldier, living out of her car in the desert. She, being a kickass woman from Canada, can teach our boys a thing or two. But oh no, the American government won't even give her, a resident alien, disability even though there's something wrong with her spine and legs. She even tried to get her story on the news, and spoke to some guy from Channel 3 On Your Side, who also grew up Mormon, and you know what he said? \"Thanks for keeping me up to speed.\" He doesn't care, he's not going to get her story on the news. He doesn't want to admit the wrongdoings of the cult of Mormon.\n\nThen I asked for her policy number. \n\n",

I'm often mistaken for a woman, I've been referenced as \"she\", flirted with by old men, outright called out on it, and given various female names that sound a little like my common man's name. I've had \"oh, sorry, it's a poor line/I have a cold/I'm really embarassed\" and others just move on and pretend it never happened. I honestly don't care, I'm not hurt or embarassed or insulted, and being British I'll often preface \"I'm actually a man\" with a \"sorry\". \n\nSo many years ago I was working for a large British distance retailer, whose name rhymes with Shmittlewoods. I got the following call:\n\nCustomer - \"I'd like to make a complaint. My girlfriend just called and she was referred to as sir and is upset about it.\" The guy was angry, raised voice etc.\n\nMe - \"I'm really sorry, I totally sympathise with her, I get called she all the time and know what it's like.\"\n\nCustomer - \"But you're a woman!\"\n\nMe - \"No, I'm not, I'm a man, like I said earlier you're speaking to [only ever a man's name]\".\n\nCustomer - \"Oh I'm sorry, I thought you were a woman. Really sorry. Well, ok, erm, never mind then.\"\n\nAnd that was that.",

It feels like time goes so slow at work and so fast after work. I can't concentrate at all after work. My vision is blurry and I have headaches and feel like shit. I spend so much energy in this job just trying to get by that I have no time or energy to make anything else of myself outside the job. \n\n\nCustomers are a race of people and I feel I hate all of them. I take over 120 calls from annoying idiots and morons who can't figure out how to read their bills, make payments or ask basic questions. It takes on average 2 minutes for them to stop rambling and actually get to the fucking point and ask a question. People so god damn stupid that when you ask their name they only say their first name. So god damn stupid that they give you their phone number without the area code because they live in a bubble where everyone is from the 208. \n\nOld people who have nothing fucking better to do than wait on hold for 30 minutes and spend another 12 minutes asking questions about $0.50 cents in charging. I know what the fuck I'm doing and you keep asking me stupid questions. Fuck you and your underhanded insults and asking to speak to someone who does know. There's nothing to fucking know. I spent 25 minutes on the phone with someone who couldn't add $22 past due  + $10 current and kept asking me what the balance what. \n\nWhen I answer the phone and say a greeting that is fucking 5 seconds long why the fuck do you say \"HEEEEEELLLLLLLLLLLLO\" like you are calling out to a fucking house instruder who is taking a shit in your living room. YOU FUCKING HEARD ME YOU CUNT ARE YOU TOO FUCKING STUPID TO ASK THE GOD DAMN QUESTION?\n\n\nI'm just non stop irritated. There is something extremely displeasing to the core of my being about helping people who are fucking ungrateful and insulting. It makes spending quality time with my SO impossible because I can't relax and then she's asking me for help with her fucking job and shit with her computer. I feel trapped in my life because I need this job for food and rent and I can't move into the career that I want and that I have fun doing. \n\nI have lost faith in humans and I really believe the average person to be a complete and bumbling idiot. How do some of these people breathe and not walk off cliffs? I sometimes speak to the same people 3-4 times a day because they seemingly have 3 second long memories and can't remember to PRESS FUCKING 1 TO MAKE A PAYMENT. They fucking call right back and repeat the same story as if I didn't just talk to you 3 times in a row. ",
