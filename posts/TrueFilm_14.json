It wasn't a bad movie by any means, it has a few strange decisions on the editing and sometimes the action really crossed the line between stylistic epicness and just straight up unintentional comedy. But overall I would say it was a pretty decent film.\n\nBut as far as Tollywood goes, I really don't see anything exceptional about it. Furthermore one would think that the heavy handed nationalist themes would make it a particular hard sale for non-Indian audiences.\n\nAnd yet, this is the one, the one Indian movie that Western audiences decided to actually watch.\n\nIs there trully anything special about this movie that made it more successful with foreigners, or was just a mix of luck and a good distribution by Netflix? What made this one the lucky one and not something like Baahubali?",

        "text": "  This article has a lot of film stills. For a fully illustrated version click here - [https://filmofileshideout.com/archives/alejandro-inarritus-bardo-false-chronicle-of-a-handful-of-truths/](https://filmofileshideout.com/archives/alejandro-inarritus-bardo-false-chronicle-of-a-handful-of-truths/)\n\n*Bardo, False Chronicle of a Handful of Truths* is a visually lush film. It’s worth seeing just for the surreal imagery and skillful cinematography. *Bardo* is clearly director and writer Alejandro G. Iñárritu’s reworking of Federico Fellini’s[ **8 1/2**](https://filmofileshideout.com/archives/do-you-see-what-i-see-interpreting-8-%C2%BD/)**.**\n\nIñárritu adopts the same narcissistic, childish, and misogynist attitudes that Fellini expressed in his film. *8 1/2* may be a masterpiece, but it is a deeply self-indulgent masterpiece. *Bardo* is less so, but it still retains the same male gaze and self-centered obsession. \n\n *Bardo, False Chronicle of a Handful of Truths* is broader than *8 1/2*. Iñárritu includes social and political ideas about the history of the Americas. He jumps through time, touching on everything from Cortez to Trump.  \n\n Iñárritu also pushes further into surrealist filmmaking than Fellini, leaning more toward Alejandro Jodorowsky. In many films that deal with[ **surrealism**](https://filmofileshideout.com/archives/three-movements-three-adjectives-surreal-absurd-magic-realist/) and dream imagery, there is a separation between reality and fantasy that slowly disintegrates until they are indistinguishable. In *Bardo*, both the real and the dream world are thoroughly blended right from the start. We are never given solid ground to stand on. It makes for a disorienting, but compelling whirlwind of surprising imagery. \n\nEven with its long running time, *Bardo* maintains its energy and interest. It is a very skillfully crafted film. I’m unsure if the navel-gazing is just a reference to Fellini, or if it is baked into making these sort of films. Charlie Kaufman’s *Synecdoche, New York* seems to avoid some of the onanism of the other two, while still being bound up in one man’s inward vision. Perhaps the fact that *Synecdoche, New York* was Kaufman’s first film kept him from the excesses of egoism.\n\n*Bardo* covers a lot of ground. It blends the full range of human experience into an ever-changing storm of imagery. The ideas and images arrange and rearrange in surprising ways that create new meanings like a rebus. The connections between scenes are less about chronology or logic, and more about meaning and association. What Iñárritu produces is something visually spectacular and full of rich information, even if it is suffused with narcissistic obsession.",

I guess the closest examples I can think of to what I mean is like Persona or The Shining, Fire Walk With Me, The Man Who Left His Will on Film, Puparia, Memoria, I want more stuff like that. I guess looking for more obscure stuff too, I need to see more of Tarkovsky's stuff.

We're talking ghosts, demons, poltergeists, entities from another realm haunting the main characters in some way or another.)*\n\nOutside of DARK WATER (the American 2005 remake) and possibly THE BABADOOK, I struggle to think of mainstream releases of horror films about ghosts or demons or otherwise sueprnatural hauntings that aren't centered around middle class families and up. Homeowners who don't ask what it costs to bring a medium out to cleanse their house. Or who are able to move house at the drop of a hat once things get scary.\n\nThe reasons seem intuitive at first: working class people can't afford to live in a big haunted mansion, or even be home owners at all anymore. So what's being haunted? Not long vaulting corridors and cavernous basements. There's no creepy hedge maze out in the backyard, etc.\n\nBut one of thing things I think DARK WATER did quite well was use economically depressed and neglected housing projects as a modern version of the derelict 19th century mansion. Showing us that cramped corridors and dark laundry rooms in the basement can be as terrifying as a Victorian child nursery.\n\nAnd one thin I appreciate about Dark Water and Babadook in particular is showing the ways in which the supernatural horror seeps into the horror of economic precariousness and mental health problems that you can't afford to deal with on a near-minimum wage salary.\n\nThere's obviously also a racial component here, in that cinematic hauntings tend not to just happen to middle class people, but white middle class people. But that feels like it should almost have its own discussion.\n\nAm I missing some movies here, or is this genre as middle-class/upper middle class centric as it seems? And are there reasons for this that I'm missing?",

I really like August Diehl as Franz Jagerstatter, who portrays him as a man who is being tested on his Loyalties and whether or not he should serve the Nazis. Diehl portrays him as a person being true to higher moral principles and obligations of goodness, regardless of those who think differently.\n\nAlso, as I said on another post, I think this movie is a comeback for Terrence Malick after making his last 3 movies being at his most experimental, to the confusion of anyone who see these movies. I think A Hidden Life is Malick coming to his senses and deciding to combined on what he made in the 70s and what he was doing in his experimental phase.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on A Hidden Life?\n\nDo you think this movie was some sort of comeback for Terrence Malick?",

Now that we are so close to seeing results of this poll I was wondering whether people on this subreddit would like to make some final predictions about films which get chosen for this poll and their placements on the list.\n\nWhich film will be number 1? Do you feel it would be reigning champ Vertigo or would Citizen Kane return take back its spot? Or maybe its time for Tokyo Story or 2001: A Space Odyssey to take the top spot?\n\nWhich films of 2010s do you see making the list? How high do you think these will place?\n\nAre there any major films that will increase or decrease their rankings? Maybe because of political factors?",

I personally found it to be absolutely fascinating and well done. I think the only caveat I'd mention is Mushett makes his politics pretty clear in the podcast (left leaning) which I realize might not be for everyone, but still I really liked it and it's a pretty short series. I'm hoping he'll do more in the future, but I was curious if anyone else here has heard it.",

        "text": "Here’s my start with Bresson. Other than frequently hearing A Man Escaped references I knew nothing about his work going in. Needless to say I was shocked by the uniqueness of his style. The lack of music draws further attention to detail of the images on screen. This becomes doubly effect when every shot screams to you how carefully selected it was. And there is no better way to watch a film than with the knowledge that you are in the hands of a true craftsman. \n\nTake, for example, the scene where Lucien’s jailbreak attempt is thwarted. An obvious shot to depict the guard’s pursuit of their renegade prisoner is to literally show the cops running through the halls. Instead, Bresson shoots the bottom of Yvon’s door. You can hear the alarm blaring. From the crack between the bottom of the door and the ground you can see the lights flare on, then the shadows of the guards running by accompanied by the sound of their footsteps. This decision does infinitely more to put the audience in the perspective of Yvon. \n\nAnother instance, Yvon’s murder of the family, again demonstrates Bresson’s ability as an artist. What filmmaker wouldn’t want to show Yvon lopping his victim’s head off ? Bresso. Such a decision might primarily provide shock value when an alternative could deliver much more. Bresson opts not to show the murder themselves, instead tracking the family dog anxiously running through the house unable to save its owners. What better way to evoke a sense of helplessness in the viewer ?\n\nTo this last question: who is really helpless here ? Certainly the audience. As is the dog and the family. Yvon is the curious case. Bresson almost portrays Yvon a a helpless actor, failed by society. This is almost true, except that Yvon is not totally helpless. There is no doubt that society failed him, but he —in turn— fails society. This is in no way a belittlement of his struggles, it is just to say that Yvon still had choices, and he chose theft and murder. \n\nL’Argent is a beautifully painted portrait of a man whom the world has turned their back towards. Bresson asks no sympathy for this world as the man directs his rage back at it. After watching this film it becomes clear why incredible directors such as Jean-Luc Godard a d Andrei Tarkovsky had such deep respect for him. \n\nThe final scene takes place in a restaurant where Yvon confesses his murders to the police. A large crowd has gathered outside and watches as the cops escort him out. Strangely, as Yvon passes out of the door, the crowd continues to stare inside, as if they are waiting for something else to come. Are they waiting for another Yvon ?",

For example, there is a lot of plot explanation, and some of the characters really feel flat. \n\nI always appreciate Nolan's decision to minimize CGI whenever possible. In particular, the famous \"hallway scene\" for which they used no CGI and actually built a rotating set and relied on wires. This scene still invokes some sense of \"movie magic\" in me. \n\nI think the reason why the hallway scene resonates with me is that it feels like the intent was to make the film's world as organic as possible. Again, I wholly agree, the film is flawed, the world building is janky, but deep down, when I watch the hallway scene, I feel like I am watching Nolan's desire to visually dazzle *match* his commitment to make this world feel real. It feels grounded and organic versus how I felt about some of the visuals of \"Tenet,\" which are much larger in scope, but feel a bit more superficial.",

The song in question is Simon &amp; Garfunkel’s “Sound Of Silence” now this is a fine song on it own and this post is in no way a hate post towards the song. This song however is much too heavy handed if a song is supposed to compliment the scene. The scene is supposed to set up and make you feel (in this case) sad and the music is supposed to heighten the feeling set by the writing setting up a scene. Sound Of Silence however is not a song that heightens the scene it is in it overpowers it and is too on the nose. A example of this is the comedians funeral in Zach Snyders 2009 film “Watchmen” during the Comedians funeral. This song plays in and attempt to elicit an emotion from us yet the song takes president during in my opinion a rather bland scene.  I don’t really know how to conclude this but I hope my point has come across",

It's also a glaring error that \"Talokan\" as a term comes from Aztec religion's underworld of Tlālōcān, and not any authentic Maya cultural practice.\n\nOverall the plot is bloated and the skilled ensemble cast carry this film in spite of what's been scripted for them, not because of it. Ludwig Göransson's score is a high-calibre musical experience which fleshes out the vibes of Talokan culture more than any other aspect of the film. It's unfortunate that the cinematography features frequent and jarring scene switches between 1.90:1 and 2.39:1 despite all being filmed with the same model of Sony Venice camera.\n\nThere was a lot of potential in this film, and it's not *unenjoyable*, but I can't help but walk away feeling the same people could have made a much more nuanced and interesting movie.

Badlands and Days Of Heaven really impressed me. But after those 2 films, Malick went on a 20 year Hiatus and returning with The Thin Red Line.\n\nOne thing I find interesting with A Thin Red Line is that a lot of a list stars are cast in Malick's film only for them to be either cut out or only in there for a few minutes. and that Malick seem to do this with other films. (Knights Of Cups, Song To Song)\n\nAlthough Malick has impressed me, he somewhat went on an experimental phase in the 2010s, with To The Wonder, Knights Of Cups, and Song To Song with these films being unlike other films like little to no dialogue. and I think these films confused me and I felt I was wasting my time with these movies. \n\nAlthough It seem after Song to Song, I feel Terrence Malick came back to his senses and went back to a conventional film with A Hidden Life, which really impressed me. I feel Malick combined what he did in the 70s and what he did with his experimental movies and resulted in probably in one of his best films, A Hidden Life. I hope Malick continues this trend with The Way of The Wind\n\nWhat do you think of Terrence Malick?\n\nWhy do you think a lot of actors like to work with Malick despite some of them getting cut or only a cameo",

        "text": "I can't seem to find any exact discussion on this topic on Reddit, but are films starting to become more about being statements than being stories? Make no mistake, it's great that independent cinema is becoming more mainstream now-- but I still feel every filmmaker aims to provide a commentary on something more than actually deliver an interesting story. Both can coexist (take *Parasite*) but we seem to be living in a time where storytelling can be sacrificed as long as it's talking about something important (take *Triangle of Sadness*)\n\nPlus, where do we start with just the repetitiveness of it all. Going to watch a lot of the awards/film fest contenders this year means watching films that only want to be dissertations. Look at *Tár*, *Women Talking*\\-- Hell, even a fun film like *Barbarian* or *The Menu* only exists to comment on something. If it's not that, then it's aimed to be extremely inaccessible so that only a select crowd who understand it can truly love it-- like *Aftersun* or *Nomadland*. Or it's ballistic, crazy visions that can sometimes be divisive like *Weird: The Al Yankovic Story* or *Everything Everywhere All At Once* (yup).\n\nTo reiterate, what was once niche is now mainstream-- which is of course good because everyone should get to make what they want to make.\n\nBUT\n\nWhat ever happened to the balance of it all? Barring maybe *Glass Onion* and *Top Gun: Maverick*, no production house seems to be taking non-IP stories, no film festivals are picking up stories that aren't inaccessible commentaries (except *Cha Cha Real Smooth* and *Good Luck To You Leo Grande*\\-- the exception outweigh the norms) and (worst of all) upcoming filmmakers are aping more and more of these styles in the films they create. PTA spoke of walking out of his class when his professor dissed *T2: Judgement Day* but quite frankly, no other lover of PTA has learned from that.\n\nThe Oscar list for 2019 shows that year probably the last best-- in my opinion, those films had the best balance of everything AND had relevant themes that could be consumed by just about anyone. But also production houses were also making films like *The Lighthouse*, *Midsommar*, *The King*. Going even further back to like 2009 shows even more of that. \n\nThe hyper-intellectual surge in filmmaking now tends to point to an almost gatekeeping of sorts taking place and I can't help but feel it goes against what made cinema such a communal experience in the first place.\n\nTo sum it up, if you watch *The Fabelmans* and see the kind of short films Spielberg's avatar was supposedly making, no way would that be accepted into a film festival in this day and age despite it probably bringing people a lot of joy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n...and I would love to know your thoughts on it. :)",

        "author": "flowelol",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/z6cl4w/as_someone_who_loves_oldboy_and_had_high/",
        "text": "I was really hyped going into I Saw The Devil, as it is generally highly recommended online. However after watching it I'm pretty damn disappointed. I thought the movie was very shallow and pulpy and didn't say much of anything about \"revenge\" or \"murder\". The first murder of Joo-Yeon was very well put together and interesting, then the rest of the violence through the movie was at best comical and at worst disgustingly executed. I won't spend too much time comparing this movie to Oldboy but just in general I think that Oldboy utilized violence and drama infinitely better than I Saw The Devil. I won't faint at the sight of blood but at the same time I'm somewhat sensitive to gore, and I'd say the violence and action in this movie is generally a mixed bag.\n\nThe murder of the second woman is just a mediocre retread of Joo-Yeon except it lacks the horror and tension because she just gets in the car with him willingly? I don't know if stranger danger culture is the same in Korea but I feel like it's something taught at an early age, ESPECIALLY to women, to not get in a stranger's car as it reduces the chance of you being rescued or found by like 90%. The thing that makes Joo-Yeon's murder so horrific is that she does everything right (only barely cracking the window, telling him politely and firmly that she doesn't need help) but in her situation she's screwed no matter what. It evokes a very real feeling of fear and helplessness, something that is pretty much completely absent from the rest of the movie. One aside I have about the greenhouse scene and when Soo-Hyeon first catches him is how the girl he's about to rape is screaming the whole time but when Kyung-Chul hears/sees something and tells her to shut up she literally just obeys him? All of the people that Kyung-Chul interacts with are all spineless pushovers that just lay down and let themselves be killed, it feels like a portrayal of a weird alternate reality instead of any substance about real life. Then, the fact that he's a serial killer and gets picked up by another group of serial killers and then they all have a crazy knife fight is a hilarious premise but feels tone deaf following the first two murders.\n\nThe SECOND rape scene at the hospital is god awful and feels like a D-tier snuff film scene. He goes in to get treated, shits all over the doctor and nurse and then goes into what looks like an employee only area to wait for her to walk in? Is this real? In Korea can you just verbally abuse and sexually assault people in a public building with zero repercussions? Why is the building completely devoid of human beings except for these three people until Soo-Hyeon shows up to make it four? What the hell is the point of even spending the first 10-20 minutes of the movie trying to make the audience sympathize with Soo-Hyeon if you're just going to have him sit in his car like a dumbass as he listens to Kyung-Chul rape this nurse, then only busts in when it's 'dramatically' appropriate? Why does he tell the nurse that she has to patch up the man who just raped her like it's a cool action line following a fight scene when it's on par with most of the shit that comes out of Kyung-Chul's mouth in terms of insane? (As an aside the part where Kyung-Chul gets close to the nurse and slowly lowers her down to her knees was a -5/10 directing decision and was obviously made by a man who thinks this is what rape is like). I don't know how anyone can call this a good film much less a \"deep dark revenge story\" with this juvenile shit in it. This is like hentai level writing.\n\nI can't talk about the rest of the movie without this post being a mile long so I'll try to move along the plot faster. The stuff with Kyung-Chul's cannibal friends feels like a resident evil parody, they have this insane creepy mansion out in the middle of nowhere with a bunch of dogs that they never use. Wonderful. Tae-Joo's girlfriend is a complete headache of a character conceptually, she's with this guy who specifically kills and eats women and is best friends with a guy who does the same thing except rapes them as well. Then she literally has the easiest chance to kill Soo-Hyeon and whiffs it by yelling before stabbing her knife and goes down in one hit. It's like this movie has absolutely zero faith in women to be competent at literally anything, which is saying something because comparatively the men are functioning at maybe 5-10% competency in this movie. All of the violence and action for the rest of the film except for the last scene is absurdly goofy. The guy getting hit with a stick on the toilet, Tae-Joo getting his jaw ripped off in the hospital bed (again, there is not a single soul around to hear or see this happening despite seeing a crowded lobby in the previous scene), Kyung-Chul waltzing up to Soo-Hyeon's house and killing his family with no obstacles whatsoever, it's all definitely violent but comes across as just really silly. The drive-by kidnapping is also corny as hell but I will admit that the way the scene is shot to look like a passerby is witnessing this happen was an interesting change of perspective. Also, the thought of Kyung-Chul running/getting dragged alongside Soo-Hyeon's car for so long that it becomes dark out is funny to me.\n\nMy biggest problem with this movie is Soo-Hyeon's decision making and motivations. I was under the impression that you're supposed to watch him slowly become a monster throughout the movie, but he kinda just starts off terrible and stays pretty much the same. If he wants Kyung-Chul to experience the same pain that Joo-Yeon did, why the fuck does he keep releasing him to the general public in places substantially far away from where he is?? I can only assume that he wants him to continue killing people so he can catch up and beat him up right as he's about to kill them, except he's only able to do this successfully 50% of the time. The scenes where Soo-Hyeon is frantically driving to wherever Kyung-Chul is is hilarious because he's the one who put him that far away?? Why not release him somewhere more convenient for you? I get that the point is that he's losing his humanity by finding pleasure in the catch and release of his prey but he's so lenient in his release and so bad at catching him that it makes Soo-Hyeon look like the least prepared and dumbest psychopath of all time. The only scene that has any semblance of interesting content after the first murder is the final scene between Kyung-Chul and Soo-Hyeon. This is what I assumed was going to be the bulk of the film, the main character talking to and torturing a serial killer, but the majority of I Saw The Devil is shoddily put together, SELF-IMPOSED chase scenes. And in the end Kyung-Chul gets off pretty damn easy, a guillotine is way less painful than getting stabbed or beaten to death. The added bonus of his family being the ones who open the door and kill him is an interesting concept but falls flat as we're shown that he doesn't give a fuck about them?\n\nSo in the end, what the hell is the takeaway from this film? So much of Soo-Hyeon's actions are illogical in order to allow Kyung-Chul to keep raping and murdering that I fail to see how any meaningful message could be extracted from his character. Was it the pain of losing his wife that forced him to make a nurse watch him brutalize a man's foot, then treat the man who just raped her? Was it the sorrow he witnessed all around him from his family and loved ones that made him decide to repeatedly put Kyung-Chul in extraordinarily far places so it's pretty much guaranteed he will continue killing innocent people? Watching Soo-Hyeon royally fuck up the torture of Kyung-Chul while getting like 15 more people killed with zero emotion, then suddenly breaking down in tears when he finally kills him is the polar opposite of rewarding or meaningful. Can someone explain to me why people regard this film so highly?",

        "text": "You've probably heard of the phenomenon of the car that becomes famous through its cinema appearance - Herbie from *The Love Bug*, the Aston Martin DB5 from *Goldfinger*, the Pontiac Firebird Trans Am from *Smokey and the Bandit*... Sometimes even the manufacturers catch wind of such notability and capitalize on it through products like the [Ford Mustang Bullitt](https://fordauthority.com/2021/01/last-ford-mustang-bullitt-has-rolled-off-the-assembly-line-at-flat-rock/). But when does a car become as notable as the stars in it - or even more?\n\nI'd say that there are several rules:\n\n1. The car needs to be tied to the protagonist(s) - it has to be the one that they drive during every extended driving sequence, and it needs to match their personality. For example, every time Dude Lebowski gets into a car, it's his trusty Ford Gran Torino that's as haggard as he is.\n\n(Also, this is why *Baby Driver* failed to launch any automotive stars - when Baby hops from everything from a Saturn Aura to a Dodge Challenger Hellcat, it's hard to determine that single important one that really matches him)\n\n2. The car needs to be there during the really important parts - for example, the DeLorean in *Back to the Future* is always on the screen when time travel is involved, and the Minis in *The Italian Job* are the getaway cars during the escape from the heist.\n\n3. The car should get as much screen time as the script allows - while being on screen from the start to the very end is not an imperative, such a role certainly helped machines like Kowalski's Challenger, Bandit's Firebird Trans Am or the Bluesmobile join the four-wheeled pantheon.\n\nI would also add an additional rule - it helps when the car is special in some way. Sure, a stock-looking machine has the possibility of earning its fame (*The Italian Job*, *Bullitt*, *The Graduate*), but the miraculous nature of Herbie, the gadgetry of Bond cars, or even the crappiness of *Vacation's* Family Truckster has helped a lot.",

It’s an important story to tell, it’s told in a way that feels authentic, and the actors are all decent. But on the whole it’s kind of hard not to feel like it’s a filmed Wikipedia article. It totally fails to make either journalist a compelling character, nothing visually interesting ever happened, and it’s pretty simple and straightforward on the whole. \n\nOn its own I don’t think that’s a special opinion, but that’s also how I feel about journalism movies that people seem to really like. All The Presidents Men and Spielberg’s The Post also totally fall flat for me when it comes to making the journalists compelling, and also aren’t filmed in an interesting way. And while I would say I liked Spotlight, I also think it has those two issues. All of these movies feel a bit too slowly paced and straightforward-plotted to feel like thrillers, and they don’t have deep enough characters to really work dramatically IMO.

To be fair, it's more than just drunkenness. It's drunk, insomnia ridden, and making an extremely frightening and emotional choice to talk to someone the character hasn't seen in many years, while basically a wreck. I did my best to inform the actor on the character's state of mind, search for relatable experiences in their own life, we even did some physical excercises (pacing and hyperventilating to create tension and lightheadedness) which really helped on the first rehearsal but less so on this one. This film will involve a lot of drunk acting. I am deeply familiar with the characterisation of drunkenness, having dealt with alcoholics in my own life, but I am at a loss on how to better communicate this to the actor. I consider myself still learning on directing, and this film I am trying to go above and beyond the level of realism in performance from what I've done before. What advice would you give to me on this? I am also wondering if you have any case studies of great drunk acting performances in film I can point to the actor for reference. Thank you.",

        "text": "I watched this movie because it was on Netflix and I was just looking for something to watch, and I actually really enjoyed it. I looked through previous reddit posts and found that people seemed to hate this movie, and it’s regarded as awful by most reviews, so I wanted to make a post defending what I liked about it.\n\nFirst, I see a lot of criticism around the film being manipulative that I just don’t think applies. The movie starts with will smith portraying an IRS drone uninvolved in peoples lives, and starts meandering down a path of revealing aspects of his character slowly within the first 45 minutes, when he helps the old lady and when he helps Rosario. You never really suspect he is anything other than someone trying to buck the trend so to speak and help these people, really go above and beyond.\n\nThis trend holds until he seeks out helping the lady for domestic abuse and to give his kidney. This changes his character and shows the viewer that he’s more than just kind, he’s trying to be selfless. we don’t know what dark past he has that is compelling this behavior, but he’s clearly trying to emulate selfless behavior\n\nThe final change is the house deed and bone marrow transplant, at this point it’s clear it’s beyond selfless even, he’s giving everything for some reason. You still don’t know why, you don’t know his future, but it’s something big.\n\nI can see where some people may think drastic actions and un-real events such as the house are ham handed attempts at emotion, but I think they fit perfect in telegraphing the change in depth of the plot while simultaneously putting you in a state of disbelief so you’re looking for any catch but the obvious; is she his daughter? Did he murder someone? Is he gaining something? You look everywhere but the fact he’s moving toward literally giving it all away\n\nSecond, and definitely related, I think the acting and writing were good. My main criticism is the end wasn’t great and I felt a car crash wasn’t the right motivator for this character, but at the same time it adds to the character he felt so deeply about something like that. it did give a slight sense of souring the characters kind of neutral good vibes.\n\nThe acting and writing was good though, especially the dinner scene I felt a lot of plot development was covered through will smiths acting, like when he forgets his brother to stay yet lies about his future, it really puts off a care to the wind feeling that then hits home when you find he was lying. the printer scene was also very good, despite being such a cliche plot point I found myself convinced it was a touching moment to her core.\n\nAll in all, a lot of will smiths scenes came back and hit even harder when you realize he’s not afraid of her (and other characters) hurting him, he’s afraid of himself hurting her at all. It just adds that final punch to the overall goal of the movie.\n\nI’m willing to admit it suffers in areas, but overall it was a 7.5 to 8 and definitely not deserving of the 2 to 4 the internet has levied on it",

Many of you that follow my Reddit know that I'm a real fiend for special effects. I go bananas and I love to monkey around. \n\n2. Mulholland Dr. - I thought this movie would be about doctors but it was actually about a road in Las Angeles. It was pretty weird to say the least, and I got really scared. \n\n3. Dumb land. This was an underrated mastersliece almot as good as molhullad dr.\n\n4. Blue velvet.\nThis movie made some more sense compared to the Mulholland doctor but still overall didn't make much sense, and it made me scared the same way that mulholland's doctor made me scared.\n\n5. Lost highway same as blue velvet. \n\n6. Wild at heart kind of the same as Lost highway and blue velvet, except it had Nicholas Cage who is actually related to my favorite movie director Sophia capala, he is her cousin.\n\n7. The straight story , this movie I fell asleep in. Iwatched it with my brother Paul..\n\n8. The Netflix one withcthe monkey. Even though I love to go bananas, I did not go bananas for this film because I didn't understand it at all.\n\n9. Last byt not least eraserhead, which really scared me. \n\n10. Last but not lowest david lynchs daily weather reports. Not my favorite because i dont live inLA so i dont know what I'm the weather is actually like. \n\n11. Last and least, the elephant man. I thought this movie was weird. Well i don't think i watched it all. It was in Mrs. Allens english class in 10th grade i think i was busy taking a much needed nap because our school system made all the kids wake up so early to make it to the bus, i could not sleep enough each night. Part of it i think was my actual dreams i had because i dreamed there was a deformed guy butt he didnt look like an elephant that much. I remember he worked at the circus and his owner whupped his ass. \n\nI hope we can have a productive filme discussione aboute these filmes and cinematic features, leave a comment down below 👇 ;)",

        "text": "I don't think anyone on this sub needs to be reminded that Avatar: Way of the Water is around the corner. While most of the discussion about Cameron's return to feature films has been centred around the movie he directed 13 years ago, the one which is the direct predecessor of Avatar: Way of the Water, I actually feel this would be a great time to talk about Cameron's other movies that achieved the distinction of being the highest grossing film of all time at its release 25 years ago. \n\nUnlike Avatar no one can deny that Titanic didn't have a cultural impact. Think of all the scenes that have becomes iconic, the number of memes it spawned ( Draw me like one of your French girls, I am the King of the World, Gentlemen it's been an honor playing with you tonight). Think of the interest in the titular ship and the disaster that was renewed because of this film, all the theories and arguments about whether the door was big enough to fit Jack on it, Celine Dion's song being blasted from everywhere. It made its two leads especially Leonardo DiCaprio superstars and that had the knockback effect on a lot of the career of someone like Martin Scorsese in the 21st Century. Could Scorsese have made all of these expensive prestige films if he didn't have DiCaprio's popularity from Titanic to capitalise on?\n\n\nThe thing that interests me about Titanic is that it is a continuation of the grand historical romance epic that just like Titanic were massive commerical and critical successes. It is a direct successor to Gone With The Wind, Doctor Zhivago.  All of these lengthy movies centered around a important historical event that also has a majority of its focus on the romance between its two attractive leads.  The romance will however have a tragic ending and the world moves on, now completely changed due to the important historical event. This type of tale has always been popular throughout the ages, one that captures the thrill and excitement of a historical event while also capturing the tenderness and melodrama of a tragic romance between two beautiful people.\n\nThe interesting part to me is that it feels that movie industry decided to give up on replicating this kind of success after some time. I know they tried with Pearl Harbor but with the franchise domination that started in Hollywood in 2000s because of the success of Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings, maybe these types of romance epics are too risky of a bet. Yet I also precisely think that the market has enough space that a great movie in this genre has the potential to to explode in popularity. After all Titanic was just following in the footsteps of Gone With the Wind and Doctor Zhivago and some other film could now take it's lead.",

        "text": "I started this film earlier this week, but deferred watching it until I've had my head set straight. I chose to watch this film because it is the only entry in Japanese by Kiarostami, and I wanted to explore a director looking at milieux that were comfortable to me. The story is ostensibly simple: a high-end prostitute who is slowly trying to refuse sleeping with customers is tapped to visit a customer from afar. Instead of a mere sexual tryst, however, the viewer (as voyeur) is introduced to Takashi, who only wishes to have dinner with her, even preparing a specialty from her province. There are many films that explore the quick evolution of interpersonal dynamics: I recall Cronenberg's *Eastern Promises*, for instance, where a gangster realizes that there is a limit to violence and does whatever he can to protect that which he was supposed to kill. **Like Someone in Love**, however, explores the dynamics that are more relatable: how can people transition from ignorance toward friendship? \n\nIn his final film, Kiarostami suggests a story within claustrophobic spaces. Akiko is using prostitution to augment her income, but is trying to escape from it because of her toxic relationship with her boyfriend, Noriaki, who attempts to dominate her.\n \nKiarostami emphasizes that the nature of relationships is fickle, and that so much can change within a short amount of time. Although Tadashi merely tapped Akiko to reminisce about his estranged granddaughter, he eventually becomes a protective, paternal figure as Akiko's lies are slowly debunked with Noriaki's detection. \n\nAkiko, however, is not a mere victim: she also condones such a power dynamic, and she and Noriaki are like tangled vipers who poison each other's lives. Perhaps one of the reasons is that she could tell no one; perhaps she has a difficulty accepting that she made a mistake. After all, \"he was a three-dan in karate,\" but it was only attractive in the beginning. \n\nThere is always an undercurrent of violence in the film, and this is personified by Noriaki. While raw, masculine power is indeed attractive to many women, possessing only that as a positive trait is equally problematic, as Akiko herself realizes. In fact, I can recall the brilliant conversation occurring in the awkward car ride with Noriaki, Tadashi, and Akiko: she made a mistake in answering Durkheim, instead of Darwin, as the father of evolution. Tadashi, however, continued that Durkheim delimited what Darwin discovered in humans. From what I also remember, humans who find no reason in their existence or are incongruent with their society develop *anomie*, which can culminate in violence. Violence, similar to the film's ending, can just explode from anywhere, after all.\n\nIt is impressive to me that Kiarostami was able to express Japanese laconism through his characters. Kiarostami shows that being \"like someone in love\" is different from truly loving someone. \n\n9/10",

The character Han Gong-ju suffers from cerebral palsy and the loneliness I imagine her to be feeling is killing me.\n\nIn Oasis, there is also the character Hong Jong-du, who is mildly mentally disabled. There is a scene where he approaches two young girls from behind with a grin on his face, asking them for money and they look at him weirdly and walk away. On both viewings this scene has really shook me, because the way the girls act is how they are excepted to act. And how I've acted towards multiple strangers for whom I've had a weird feeling about.\n\nIn multiple parts of the film it's mentioned, directly or indirectly, how the two disabled people are a burden for their families and even for the society. When they are locked up in prison or in their tiny apartment, everything is good. Out of sight, out of mind.\n\nAnd I can see that this general uneasiness towards disabled people is why we practically never see them presented in mainstream film. It's not pleasant so we turn our eyes away.\n\nSo what I am asking for is recommendations for films which handle disabilities. Films that have something interesting to say about disabilities and/or films in which a main character has a disability and it's an important part of their character.",

        "text": "I'm using \"pulp\" as an umbrella term for low-budget and highly stylised fiction, often telling stories about violence and offering creators a relatively high level of freedom so long as they satisfy particular genre expectations. The apparent disappearance of this type of media is something I've been thinking a lot about lately, not purely with regard to film, but this is the best place I could think of to post this. If pulp/exploitation cinema has in fact disappeared (please discuss below), I think it's a damn shame because I believe that historically these types of films have been instrumental in expanding the stylistic capabilities of cinema. Just look at how often the aesthetic language of spaghetti westerns or blaxploitation films get referenced by other filmmakers. Even stuff like slashers I would argue has greatly pushed the medium forward, even if there's a high ratio of truly influential films to fully forgettable ones.\n\nHere are some possible reasons for why this type of fiction isn't prominent any more:\n\n1. Audiences are just too irony poisoned to accept an earnest story that embraces style over substance. The \"Cinema Sins\" culture of film criticism might be to blame for this. Idiosyncracies that aren't constantly brought attention to with broadly comedic \"quips\" are seen as unambiguous signs of a bad movie. \n2. When everything was shot on film, even shitty, cheap movies had an endearing aesthetic quality to them. When shot digitally, those kinds of films tend to just look ugly.\n3. Theatres can't justify screening niche genre stuff anymore due to a variety of reasons that have already been discussed in hundreds of threads here, including streaming and the current franchise landscape. \n\nWould love to hear what you guys think.",

        "text": "I just re-watched Todd Field's TÁR at home, and it still holds up just as well as when I watched it in theaters. It rightfully deserves its place in this year's crowded Best Picture race because of its filmmaking, acting, and writing. Yet what truly makes this film stand out from most other films in 2022 is its subject matter and presentation style. This is a slow-burn, 158-minute drama about a classically-trained musical conductor, and that description would already turn off mainstream moviegoers. Therefore, the film stands out because **it completely affirms itself as high art.**\n\nTÁR is mostly set across Europe and in New York, in big concert halls and lecture rooms, with countless monologues and conversations where the characters all discuss philosophy and the deeper meanings behind compositions. The film also starts off by playing the *closing* credits, which makes it seem like a highbrow arthouse picture and risk being called \"pretentious\" by less astute individuals. Of course, the characters also reference the works of Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, and other composers who lived over 300 years ago, and whose direct influence would be lost upon Millennials and Gen-Z'ers with no familiarity for the classics. If you don't have an above-average IQ, you won't understand or like this movie at all, and you're probably better off watching something simpler for your own liking, like Black Panther 2.\n\nWhile I'm here, I might as well discuss my interpretation of the titular character. Lydia Tár is someone morally complex who performs some questionable acts, such as gaslighting her fellow musicians, students, benefactors, and lovers, while silencing anyone who dares to question her power. She's a lot like Terrence Fletcher from *Whiplash*, a respected composer who's also manipulative and abusive to his subjects, and normally I wouldn't question the actions of the star conductor because they're just doing their job. But because this is a woman at the forefront, and she mentions how many boots she had to lick to become this famous in a male-dominated field, it makes me more aware of how messed up she is. In the #MeToo era, people are finally becoming more critical of institutions that were once respected for decades just as women themselves are about to take the reins in these industries, and it's especially gratifying to see a trailblazing female experience her gradual downfall.\n\nTÁR is everything that intellectually-minded film fans could possibly want. And its meager box office of $5 million only re-affirms that statement, showing that most audiences are uncultured plebeians who only pay for the usual blockbusters. And now that it's available to watch on VOD, with clips from the film circulating all over Twitter, people clearly misunderstand the point of scenes that can be played out of context, thereby proving that they're not smart enough to understand the whole context and that the film is beyond criticism. That's what makes the film stand out above all its peers in this year's awards race. It's not a zany multiverse adventure, or an aerial action movie, or a sci-fi epic set on a distant planet. Rather, it's a deliberately-placed slow-burn drama made by an auteur, with characters who are all wildly intelligent, and this makes it inherently more prestigious than its peers. If anything other than TÁR wins Best Picture in March, it means that the film industry has firmly rejected the notion of the medium as art over product. This must not happen as long as high-quality character studies like this film exist.",

        "text": "Aftersun is a lot of things--at the same time it is both joyous and wrought with sadness. It is about having fun, but also the boredom in-between. It is about being both too young and too old. It is very much a poem that points to its narrative but never directly tells you what it is trying to say, electing to show instead.\n\nYoung Sophie celebrates her 11th birthday at a vacation resort with her also young father. From the onset, we can see the love for his daughter despite not being together with the mother any longer. They spend over a week together at a resort doing benign things like swimming, playing pool, and filming it all the while. Early on, the film hints at Colum's apathy towards his own self-care while at the same time we watch him trying to provide his daughter with love and protection he didn't receive and doesn't give to himself. It's in little comments like when his daughter asks how he broke his wrist, and he said he doesn't recall that we can begin to paint a picture of his pain and struggles. These quickly fade away and we're on to the next activity. Colum is constantly pushing to go on to the next activity. We assume that it is to be sure his daughter doesn't get bored with their trip but we later realize it is because when there is absence, then he has nothing to buffer from his crippling sadness.\n\nSophie is at an inflection point in her life. She no longer sees herself as a kid but she is not yet an adult. There are times where she revels in aspects from both sides of this coin. The idea of age and what you are ready for at any given age is a pervasive theme throughout the film. We recognize that Colum must have had Sophie when he was around 18 or 20 which is undeniably young these days.\n\nThe acting is phenomenal. The chemistry between the leads feels so genuine and the blurred lines between home movie and memory is enchanting. It shows how we can tend to remember the good parts of growing up as that is what was deemed worth filming. It's not until you reflect on it further that you realize dad was actually broke, broken, and willing to drown literally and metaphorically.\n\nThe narrative itself is very loose and most of it is merely implied. It really gives back what you can put into it. You have to take these vignettes and extend them out in your head to get the complete picture. A broken wrist is not just a broken wrist; a self-defense lesson, a rug, a dance are all parts of the whole. For her first film, Charlotte Wells displays a lot of confidence and is able to handle a really heavy subject with tact and without pretension or melodrama. The finale is some of the most powerful storytelling I've seen in recent years; achingly so.\n\nTo view it simply as a coming of age story would be missing much of what makes it beautiful. To me, it is about the moment a child realizes their parent is not invincible. When you realize that they may not in fact know the right answers. That is the moment when you are truly no longer a child and it is heartbreaking.",

Is there any ressource from which to understand post 60's Godard movies? Critical writing on his movies that engage with the post 60's movies in detail are very rare. \n\nI understand he's working on the form itself, but all the truisms and platitudes about \"deconstructing form\" are not very useful when actually engaging with his movies.\n\nSo could anyone point me to ressources that engage with some of his later films in a very concrete way, picking them apart to explain his choices and all ?\n\nI understand there's not anyhing to \"get\" about movies in general but my question in a very broad way is on what level do you enjoy the form of cinema that post 60's Godard produces, specifically in a movie like Detective if you've seen it ?",

        "text": "One of the greatest films ever made in my opinion, Running on Empty deserves another look right now. It is based - loosely, admittedly - on Bill Ayers. Whose actions 50 years ago were forgotten but it is widely accepted a. Ayers is a terrorist and b. Obama was, by an imaginary association, planning a Jihadist... we can save the IRL political commentary for now, but it is so relevant.\n\nRunning on Empty is a miracle in a way. River Phoenix was just a flash in a pan, he was so brilliant and died so young. Judd Hirsh (who can be imagined by anyone unfamiliar as Robin William's character in Good Will Hunting) is the face of radical left-wing terror. I use the reference point to highlight both the absurdity and accuracy of the depiction. Christine Lahti is the loving mother who is a little out there, means well, but is carrying the guilt of a fictional catastrophe. After a botched attempt at sabotaging a laboratory that is purely evil and yet is granted immunity by the corporatist establishment in full bloom by the end of Reagan's administration, Hirsh and Lahti shoulder the residual harm and are effectively erased and in exile. Not only do they have to take the blame, process the blame, and encompass the face of the blame, their children do too. Phoenix is unreal, he portrays a young man struggling to find himself and understand himself. The children shoulder the blame the parents shoulder, and the best they can do is survive. \n\nAnd today we have violence on a daily basis that we \"just can't prevent.\" We falsely declare that our rights to unregulated firearms supersedes any loss of life. Of course we don't think that. But our leaders don't reflect us, so we grieve and then survive, a little more jaded, a little more cynical, guarded, hurt. Meanwhile, the same people who declare the tree of liberty blah blah blah turn around and say \"Pelosi did 1/6,\" \"BLM leftist approved by dems.\" The double standard is remarkable - Jane Fonda is evil incarnate, but Tucker Carlson declared himself to be a fan of Harvey Milk's murderer as a... joke? \n\nFilm can humanize these exiled figures, and thank god. See the Trial of the Chicago 9. These entries are gifts, I urge everybody to watch this film, put a face on all Americans, and consider the underlying humanity of the people we lynch for convenience or apathy. We shoulder the guilt of ghosts, all of us.",

        "text": "So I finally got to see triangle of sadness by Ostlund. I like his work and was really excited about it.\n\nWhat I was really psyched up for was this famous yacht scene where people get seasick during a captains dinner. I heard that people walked out of Cannes due to it, and Ostlund boasts of \"want[ing] to go further than anyone had done\" when talking about vomit scenes in [movies](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.gq.com/story/ruben-ostlund-triangle-of-sadness-interview/amp)\n\nStraight away I was thinking about The Meaning of Life (1983) with Mr. Creasote and how, despite his disgusting behaviour the waiting on staff try to save face. I also thought about La Grande Bouffe (1973) and even Bunuels Phantom of Liberty (1974). From audience reactions, [media](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-reviews/triangle-of-sadness-review-ostlund-woody-harrelson-1234606543/amp/) hype, I expected this mega, unforgettable scene. I enjoyed the idea that there was this unexpected, absurd gross-out for the sake of it, moment that would absolutely shock me and surprise me.\n\nBut it is pretty lame?\n\nI felt that there was so many inconsistencies. Like, there's a moment where a guest on the yacht \"commands\" the entire crew to have fun and go for a swim. Yet, the head chef warns them that the food will go off. So you brace yourself for a scene where people experience food poisoning caused by the misuse of power by a wealthy guest, so that their own incompetency and arrogance leads to utter chaos.\n\nBut that doesn't happen as the vomiting is caused by seasickness, and people are ill before they even begin eating.\n\nSo then, you are made to believe that the Marxist captain deliberately causes the seasickness as a kind of joke(?) (there is an interview where Ostlund says that the captain \"has his fun\" with the guests by coinciding the captains dinner with a storm, but i can't find it right now).\n\nSo, I feel as though the scene itself was over thought or over written to the point that meaning is written out. Whereas just having it as a grotesque scene would have been, better maybe? Also, I noticed so many continuity errors, probably because it took six months editing this one scene that they lost control over it. \n\nTo say this was one of the selling points of the film, as its considered wild and unexpected, most of the things that happen are in the trailer. It's not actually funny and it's not even that disgusting. The Problem Child 2 ride was way worse, and probably funnier. \n\nI also found that the characters on the yacht were so interesting and fun, and yet totally unexplored. Again, I found it all rushed through and hashed together.\n\nThis is my rant anyway, I'm not sure what anyone else thought?",

        "text": "As a UK based cinema fan I have long been resigned to the idea that we often get films much, much later than the USA does. I remember waiting five months to see 'The Lighthouse' and 'Parasite' in Feb 2020 (just before the pandemic) long after most of the hype from it's inital USA run had died down. The first half of this year was filled with trips to see various films coming out in April and May, like 'Vortex' and 'Worst Person in the World'.\n\nBut since the pandemic things have changed - a lot - for me. Since the window between release on VOD or streaming has become tiny, it is now very common for me to see films come up for sale that I would like to see at the cinema but will have to wait weeks, or even months to actually see.\n\nCase and point - 'TAR'. I have the choice of either buying this film now using a VPN or waiting until January 13th to watch it in cinemas in the UK - keeping in mind you could see this film in early October in some places in the USA. Sometimes i will watch a film on streaming assuming it won't get a cinema release, only for it to pop up at screens months after I've already seen it - this happened to me with 'Bergman Island' earlier this year.\n\nI understand why this happens, as studios want to focus their attention on press and advertising in different territories: only a few of the biggest films are afforded a simultaneous Worldwide release - even films as major as 'NOPE' had to wait about a month for a UK release vs the US one.\n\nThe question is, in the age of simultaneous releasing and of tiny to-VOD windows, how much longer can this model sustain itself? How many people, like me, will go and watch something online rather than waiting months to watch it in cinemas? It feels like the main thing keeping it going is just a lack of knowledge when various things are coming out to VOD in America.\n\nIt's also a shame that for whatever reason the UK is often one of the last major territories to get most films, as someone who lives there.",

        "text": "    Okay, first off, I've only seen one movie of his, Amour, and a clip of The Piano Teacher.\n\nSo, I came across multiple instances of people misconstruing Amour (and Haneke) to an astounding degree, in fact, I'd avoided watching his films because they were touted as pessimist. Which is considerably far from truth.\n\nHaneke, at least as little as I know of his work, is a humanist. His movie Amour didn't invalidate love, it only demonstrated the tragic sides of it, the final scenes do not counter the genuine empathetic bond that these two characters shared in the earlier scenes. Georges was quite the flirt, and Anne had the prettiest laugh!\n\nThe ugly, sad, and cumbersome moments that these two lovebirds went through, weren't depressing, they were sobering. We're grounded by the unpleasantness of it all, and also given hope by how they sincerely attempt to make things work. The end was the only negative note in an otherwise heartfelt movie with multiple feel-good scenes, to contrast with the dull greys of their fate, even then, it only proved to us that there is a comfort in having control over how one dies, the movie advocates for euthanasia, not for lovelessness.\n\nHaneke has such compassion for his characters, it doesn't mean he makes them live devoid of pain, it means that he empathises with their pain and makes us empathise too. There is no compassion without pain to bring the necessity for kindness-and-care in the first place.\n\nAmour is the truest portrait of love I've seen so far, it is the kind of tragedy that we all hope to have, having lived a full life with a committed marriage that only turns sour before the face of decay, their marriage doesn't crumble but merely changes colour, what more is needed?\n\nGeorges gets frustrated with Anne's stubbornness, it wears down his inhibitions, but also, he is empathetic to her plight as well, he knows full well how taxing this has been on her too, he doesn't find the murder-suicide to be pleasant, just a relief. The marriage is still a success in every way, what failed is fate.\n\nEven in the bitter argument between Erika and her mother at the initial scene of The Piano Teacher, we see how Haneke understands humanity, the narrative doesn't denigrate either of those characters for their flaws and quirks, only shows us the true consequences of their personality traits.\n\nHaneke chooses macabre and perverted topics for delving into the rawness of humanity, he doesn't devolve into rejecting optimism, he is just balanced in his outlook on good and bad sides of life.",

It seems to me like there are three options.\n\n1) The more serious outlets are unconsciously biased/nostalgic towards the older films (e.g., Scorsese’s favorite films tend to be ones he saw as a child).\n\n2) There is institutional bias towards older films (e.g., a critic who studies film at university will have been exposed more to the classics)\n\n3) The films back then were simply better, inasmuch such a thing is possible.",
