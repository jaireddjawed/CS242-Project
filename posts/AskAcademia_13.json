Unfortunately, they do not align with any of my professors' areas of interest. I have experience drafting research proposals, mock review articles, and giving research presentations; but I have never published original research. \n\nThe research would be primarily interview based. So low cost and minimal maintenance. Is it feasible to complete a project like this in less than 6 months? Is it realistic that it would be published?\n\nAnd if it's not published, is there still academic value in the work? For example, would a PhD program that I apply to see this as research experience, even if it isn't published work?\n\nLmk if you need more details, I can provide them. Thank you for any input.",

Many times, why people go through a PhD is related to reasons that are personal, so there is often a lot of vulnerability in the class. It seems like a lot of personal information extraction and exploitation of students who may already feel alone or struggle. There are no outcomes or tangible support. The faculty usually just nods, writes notes, and continue to pry like we are study subjects. If we don’t share anything personal then it feels like a dismissal or deemed as non-participation. The energy is usually very low and negative. I see this as a conflict of interest as I have come from industry work where there would never be a manager asking personal questions. If people are struggling, there would be a referral to specialists, not further discussion. What am I supposed to make out of this? Should I see this from a different perspective?",

I.e. have you mostly rented, or have you been able to buy your own housing? More specifically i'm thinking about when you've started in academia.\n\nFor now I'm only in the application process for some PhD projects, but I'm really excited for the prospect of working in academia in the longer term. However, historically, I've always been in rented accommodation throughout my life, and rarely ever been in one place for a significant period of time. Because of that, I guess I've always had an ambition to own my own house and be 'settled' in it. However I get the impression that, when starting in academia, I'm very likely gonna have to chance the jobs and just to wherever they crop up. I am OK with this, don't get me wrong, it's what I've always done, but I do still hope to break out of the renting cycle eventually. Frankly though, I just don't have any experience of anything else. So I'm just wondering what other people's experiences have been like. Have y'all 'owned' your homes, lived in institution provided accomodation, or was it the case that you indeed moved around places, renting along the way, until you maybe got more settled at a singular institution?",

If I don't get an academic appointment next Fall, or if I want to submit an article in the summer (after current contract ends), is there any shame or reason to be crestfallen about submitting further articles without an academic affiliation?\n\nOk, that's it.

        "text": "Sorry if the question isn't worded correctly, but hopefully my post will clarify what I'm asking. \n\nI have two courses this semester that are discussing research in education, and they both differ greatly in *how* we should approach exigent issues in the field. One is very rooted in current qualitative methods, and we're being told that our research is expected to enact reflexive practices that ensure empirical research is not data driven for the sake of objectivity. We're literally discussing in class that our job as researchers is to uncover lived experiences and refrain from any kind of positivism in our conclusions. \n\nPart of our discussion this week was on how the education system is a power structure that reinforces normative practices as tools of oppression. Further, our job as researchers is to identify problems that open the doors for critical imagining of how educational spaces can be opportunities for disruptions that advance social justice. \n\nIn a different course, we're focusing on research on student learning and what best practices can be utilized to help students perform and achieve at a high level in the educational system. We're looking at cognitive psychology, teaching methods, and learning strategies. It's very much rooted in empirical research and some of our articles have used quantitative research methods. \n\nOne seems to be challenging the educational system as a whole and calling for disruptions via research; the other seems to accept the educational system as is and calls for progress in how students can experience success. \n\nI'm curious how I as a PhD student am supposed to traverse these two different philosophies on research in education. Do I treat them as separate courses like I would in undergrad and just try to appease the professor? Or should I as a PhD student take a stance on which approach I agree with and go from there?",

Mental health issues made me really unmotivated to a point of not trying, event not submitting assignments. And because of the marking scheme, I have most courses with a terrible score (D- for ex) but with some final exam score of A/A+. I had a whole semester off because of this, and it's just on this semester that I am getting adequate help (accessibility) so there is no \"proof\" that I can have by now telling that my performance is not representing my overall possibility. But research positions for summer generally end applications before this term ends, so I don't know if it's even worth trying. \n\nSo I'd like to ask here if any of you have tips to approach to professors for talking about research positions (or just networking for graduate program), and also a way to showcase I can do better than my transcripts suggest? Or is there any way to mitigate my bad grades and show that I could do research too? Thank you for any help!",

For the longest time a masters was considered the terminal degree. When I get my degree, I’ll be the second person in my academic department to have one. One other is working on theirs. I asked the only person I’ve had a good working relationship with, who has a doctorate and currently teaches my subject to be on my committee.

My wife recently got a full-time position here as well (in the same dept) and we bought a house in the area. I'm committed to staying at this school and have my sights set on promotion(s) and the PhD program too.\n\nThe Situation: \n\nWith a mindset towards promotion, I'm gearing up my CV and experience(s) to make that hurdle as easy as possible. Now, being promoted from a Lecturer doesn't require too much beyond \"excellence in teaching.\" However, with further promotions in mind, I want to show a legacy of what I know those promotions require—that is, publications. Currently, I've got three under my belt but am looking to expand.     \n\nLate 2022 I fired off a round of abstracts and did get one accepted. However, the company behind the journal, MDPi, is *questionable* in that they've had conflicts with the quality of their peer review—primarily (if not exclusively) in regard to their scientific journals. As a reminder, I am in the Liberal Arts.    \n\nAdditionally, they do charge the authors a fee (approximately 1,000 USD) to get their work published. However, I inquired about this upfront and got it in writing that I will not be charged.    \n\nThe Question:   \n\nShould I pursue publication with this journal?   \n\nThe Rationale:   \n\n - The journal itself is not known to be scummy.    \n - I am now in the field of these conflicts the company has. \n - I am at a point in my career where I don't really have the leisure of rejecting a publication—both in regard to my position and goal of promotion.  \n - The company's name won't actually appear on my CV.   \n - Publication is valuable when it comes to promotions and it's not like a higher-up is going to read all my works before making that that decision.     \n - I am not in a PhD program where what I write will be under more scrutiny and by the time I'm working on my PhD, this piece will be long done with.    \n - The fee is waived and I am content to back out if they pull some BS and try to walk that back.              \n - Ultimately, this feels more like a personal, morale conflict than something that actually risks biting me in the ass.        \n\nI welcome any feedback / input!",

        "text": "I'm currently in a MA program and have been hired as a student research assistant. I did similar work at a different institution during my BA degree. For context, this is a position with hourly pay.\n\nWhen I began speaking with this professor about working together, she emphasized that she would like a research assistant who plans to write their thesis with her as well. She wanted this for both demonstrated interest in the research and ensuring that the assistant wasn't spread too thin across multiple projects. I decided against this and am going to be writing my thesis with a different professor. She was clearly disappointed by this, but understood my reasoning. As I was the strongest candidate, she still went forward with hiring me.\n\nMy contract starts on February 1st. This week (the last week of January) I was asked to attend a 4-hour Zoom meeting pertaining to our research project. As the meeting was central to my upcoming work, I attended (and am glad I did). However, because my contract has yet to start--and because the country I'm in has *crazy* bureaucracy*--*I was not compensated for my attendance.\n\nShould I reach out to the professor to see if we can work out some way of me being paid for my time? Or should I just grin and bear it since this is a one-time occurrence? I'm typically of the opinion the wage theft / unpaid labor is bad, but I also don't want to harm my relationship with this professor. In short, I'm concerned that making a fuss about just four hours of pay could make her think I'm engaged with the project for the wrong reasons.\n\nI'm likely overthinking this, but would appreciate your advice! I definitely prioritize my relationship with her and the potential of a strong LoR over the pay. But as someone living on a student budget, the pay certainly wouldn't hurt.",

I do not publish research anymore but work on classified analysis that is shared internally. I have been experiencing severe burnout for about a year and it has significantly affected my work and my personal life. Thinking about work is starting to make me irritable and miserable. There have been days where I have been overly negative at work which is not professional. I dont have a strong connection with my coworkers, they are all older with families for the most part so they aren't interested in socializing. They are also so in love with their work that they come in on weekends or days of to do management tasks to stay on top of everything. The thought of doing that repulses me, I can't get behind this academic culture of working all the time anymore. I am worried I have wasted the last decade of my life chasing something that I inherently don't enjoy. I don't like the scientific process anymore, I am inexplicably tired of thinking about hard problems.\n\n My projects at work have started to take longer and they are of lower quality. I haven't received any direct negative news yet but I am anxious that the axe is coming. I have had a project on my work pile for a long time that has not resulted in a major deliverable. I don't know if my approach is correct and I have been stalling for a long time.  I haven't mentioned any of this to my manager because I dont want them to think I can't handle my role. They want more of a self motivated worker that doesn't need guidance. Others at work have commented on how I have not gotten enough support from my group leadership but I don't feel like I have leverage to get support. In my mind, high performers get support and if that isn't you then you are SOL.\n\nMy family and partner are commenting on my altered mental state. . Now, the reason I suspect this is burnout is because I have no urge to challenge myself. I get easily overwhelmed before  starting tasks and feel the weight of the world on my shoulders at all times. This makes me careless and less objective. If you asked me today, I would take an easy rote job where I don't have to think at all. Instead of embracing the freedom my role offers me I simply want someone else to tell me what to do.  I feel anxious, unmotivated, unprofessional, and weak. I am no good to anybody in my current state.\n\nI am currently looking at therapists to unscrew my head. I need help before I lose everything. Has anyone come back fro",

She wants to convince this grad student's supervisor that he needs to take extra 'implicit bias' workshops and get him taken off projects. \n\nI do not want to contribute to a culture of normalized toxic and/or sexist behavior in academia but I find it really hard to believe her because I find her to be a shitty person and this male grad student has been ok to me.

I mainly wanted to do research in the legal field and go to law school. \n\n\nThe Problem:\n\nI've recently accepted a research associate position at a top law school (think Ivy League - Let's name it School A) to prepare myself for law school and potentially increase my chances of getting into School A.\n\n\nThe problem that's making me frustrated is that even tho the position is a research associate position, the program is only asking me to maintain their blog and do stuff that aren't related to research. More like administrative work which is very annoying since i'm dealing with a professor who is just - gosh feels like i'm dealing with a child with no patient whatsoever and wants everything to be done right away. None of my coworkers (including my boss) can say no to him because he's very famous - but very annoying and disorganized at the same time.\n\n\nWaste-of-time (some) Duties include: \n- Check the professor's Linkedin page and accept friends request \n- Print papers for him\n- Send him stats of the website, social media accounts, and SSRN\n- Search Google Scholar for papers that cited his work and add them to his website \n- And on top of all of that maintain the blog (three posts a day, look for articles to post on the website, send reprint of the posts to the authors, etc..)\n\n\nI admit that during the interview they asked me if I have experience in Wordpress and I said yes. They told me that I'll have to work on their blog but they also said that I will do research. Their job description clearly states that this is a research position (after all it is a research associate position) but I've been working there for a while and I've done nothing related to research. \n\n\nThey have recently told me that they want me to create another blog for them and asked if I can do it. Clearly, yes I can but I didn't give them a final answer because I need them to understand that I don't want to spend my whole time working on their websites! (I'm going to have a meeting with my boss soon to discuss this but don't know if she can help me)\n\n\nThe benefits are great and the pay is high. In addition, I can get a letter of recommendation from the professor. Yet, I don't know if I should allow these reasons to stop me from asking for research opportunities or leave the program if they said that I won't do any research.\n\n\nSo is this what research associates do? What would you do if you were in my shoes?",

It is a public institution. It's fairly high in terms of public school rating but isn't the highest in the nation for my program. I graduated undergrad a year early and wanted to continue grad school here before looking at a PhD.\n\nHere is the dilemma: \n\nMy school is already pushing hard for me to stay. I presented at a regional conference in undergrad as well as received several awards for my work. The university has connected me with major names in my research interests. They even are paying my to continue this research further into a project to stay within the archives. \n\nMy question is, with this much backing already going into my research interests, would it be reasonable to continue my research here? I know sometimes these things are looked down upon, but many departments of the university have already put faith in my ability to succeed with the mentors I have (and put considerable funding into making sure I continue that). My media interests also are located in the city in which my university is stationed. \n\nWhile I am considering other programs, I know that my research partner and I are planning to apply for a grant to publicize this research. I'm wondering how it might look to the job market to apply here, knowing that I would be at the same university through my experience in higher education. \n\nAny help is appreciated!",

        "text": "Hello there! \n\nThis is my first post here so I am sorry if I mess up any rules. I am a medical student in Europe and I have been conducting research with a department at my university - which basically assigns us to various PhD students and we help them out with their work in return for experience and coauthorship. I have just begin work in the past 6 months. \n\nI have been working a male PhD student and recently reached out to more students, because I found their projects interesting and I wanted to help (possibly in the future). This however has offended my PhD student and his supervisor, and I did not know that there was a rule or such that I can only commit to one project. (Allegedly there isn’t, I have talked to main person in charge) but I read on many places that it’s unethical to work in 2 laboratories without asking your supervisor. \n\nI got a huge email about from his supervisor and I apologized many times. His supervisor told me to only commit to more projects if I have the time and if I ask for permission first. And that committing to more projects will not give coauthorship if I do it half heartedly. Which I agree with but I have given my best with all the work and the student has had no complains yet. \n\nMy PhD student reached out today regarding this and he asked me about my goals with this program. So I stated that I wanted to learn more about topics while also picking up research skills and possibly apply for a PhD in the future myself. \n\nTo this, he replied saying that these skills are useless and I shouldn’t be using this program to pad my CV and that if I am unable to commit and burn out, no one will hire me in the future. Which I do agree but I have not been negligent with my work on his project and I have completed everything before deadline. But if I do have the time, why should I not work on different projects? \n\nHe was really offended and kept saying that I am learning and I am just here to observe and not actively achieve anything and that I should be actively thinking etc &amp; that this is not just an experience gaining process. Additionally he kept saying that this is not for giving students experience and that if I have no goals I would be doing work without consequences and improperly. So if this isn’t for experience than what is this for? If I say this is only for co-authorships he is going to complain I am greedy. \n\nHowever this is the norm of the institute. They offer experience and coauthorship while we help PhD students with their work and most of the students i’ve worked with are satisfied with this. None of them have asked me to “raise questions” or actively think. Just be diligent and proper with my work. He says I should be diligent with my work but he has never complained till date? \n\nI believe I have apologized for what I did wrong here and for the misunderstandings but is it wrong to seek experience from a program like this? I am not sure how to feel after this.",

        "text": "I've got an undergraduate degree in English.   I do a lot of freelance work as a writer/editor, along with some work as an English tutor.  While in high school and university, I also did a lot of construction work, and ended up becoming a foreman of a construction business.  Today, I live in both worlds.  I still do a lot of construction work, while also doing a lot of freelance academic work.  \n\nI can observe a strong social and behavioral gap between the \"educated\" classes and the \"working\" classes.  A person with a strongly educated background will often think, behave, and address situations differently than the typical working class person.  In a way, this almost creates a situation where they cannot understand each other, or \"speak the same language\", which ends up creating mis-understanding.   \n\nFor example, let's say a group of scholars go into a bar for some drinks.  Generally, (not always of course, but often) they will take a table, and sit and talk to each-other, while having little/no contact with other groups in the bar.  The academic world is more reserved, so they're doing what they're used to.  Then, let's say a group of construction workers walk into the bar.  They're a bit louder, and they immediately start striking up conversations with other groups, start shaking hands and toasting each-other. They'll start greeting their acquaintances in the bar \"Hey Tim, did they get rid of you yet you lazy bastard?\", because construction work tends to require being up-front, constantly joking around, and straight up.  Nothing wrong with that either, but if the scholar and the construction worker talk to one another, the scholar might find him a bit rough and crude, while the construction worker might find the scholar smug and superior.  However, both sides are just behaving in a way that is expected in their respective fields.",

When a doctoral student describes being in a highly toxic and bullying program, lab, or relationship with a committee, many comments say that the student has likely committed some faux pas.\n\nFor example, I recall a student in the phd subreddit posting that they were dropped by their doctoral chair (which, to my understanding, is a kind of career homicide). They then said that the entire department had a meeting to inform the student that no one would take him on. The student had not failed out of the program.\n\nWithout missing a beat, the comments stated that there was no way a department would do this unless the student had done something wrong. I am giving a single example here, but I have read several similar posts over the years where it looks like the doctoral advisor, and may the doctoral committee, are actively working against a student, but I still have not read a comment that identifies the kind of things a student can do that would lead to this treatment.\n\nIf we put aside academic dishonesty or research misconduct, what faux pas would lead to a student being mistreated in their doctoral studies?\n\nI hope my question makes sense. I have been trying to understand why this happens to people for a while. From my end, it looks like hazing and gatekeeping.\n\nAnother part of me wonders if this is an inherent obstacle of PhDs, and everyone has to go through it. I recently read a detailed comment that stated that most people are not prepared to handle the psychological abuse of a PhD. Suprisingly, it received a very large number of upvotes, but I have never seen this sentiment expressed so plainly. It is almost like the academy is shrouded in a type of secrecy that I don't really understand.\n\nWhen students complain about what looks like bullying or being pushed out, are they actually just saying out loud something that every doctoral student has experienced but knows to keep quiet about? \n\nIf there are good books on this subject, or articles that I should read, please feel free to suggest them.
