        "text": "Some people focus on the historicity or accuracy of religion, or how it is important in a traditional context, or how it is good or bad depending on an abstract idea of \"truth\".\n\nHowever, the only reason religion gets away with extraordinary claims (regardless of if they are true or not) is that it is very meaningful to the believers.\n\nThe issue is that you can also generalize this to human rights too, as often the line between religious belief and secular moral ideas is more blur than expected. For instance, most people believe in human rights such as equality. However, all evidence is against it and nature actually prefers divergence and status hierarchy, and survival of the fittest. The only reason society gets away with defending the right of equality is that is meaningful for many people, and we shall act as if it was the truth to make it real. Then, assuming such moral axioms, we create laws and derived moral laws.\n\nSo now we have people trying to defend or refute religion on grounds of logic, science, theology, history, etc. but that is ephemeral on the context of meaning.\n\nI believe these are only two things against meaning in religions: (1) More meaningful ideas replacing it, (2) or distractions.\n\nSo far it seems distraction from religion is the thing in the West, though entertainment, porn, social media, etc. and this is proven in the context that other IRL social institutions are also decaying, not just religion. In fact, I would say religion is doing very well in the middle of the huge degradation of social life in the West as it is being replaced by virtual interactions.\n\nI believe the only thing that will replace religion is a new, more meaningful religion, or a secular idea as meaningful as religion, and so far I have not found any. It seems Nietzche tried to develop it as the Superman, but so far it has not worked.",

I don’t believe in any actually religion, my belief is that there is life after death, and I pray to an entity that I call God, I also say my thanks to Jesus Christ, doesn’t matter if he was the son of god or not he did a selfless act for us.

Of course, I understand the Christian bias and such, but even Jewish texts such as Tobias confirm many Jewish people of the time had very complex beliefs on demons, angels, miracles, etc. \n\nMaybe the reason is that all denominations of 2nd century Judaism died or were heavily reformed, but still the theology seems to be totally different.\n\nFor example, Satan and Demonic possession seem to have been central during the 2nd Temple Judaism, while today it seems most Jewish people do not believe possession is real. It seems that also many beliefs in Angelic and Demonic hierarchies were developed during that period of the 2nd temple, and Christians still put emphasis on them, yet it seems only mystic Judaism take them seriously anymore, while mainstream Judaism seems to be (ironically) closer to 1st Temple Judaism, adopting a simpler cosmic vision and afterlife again.\n\nWhat is the explanation of this?",

        "text": "I had been researching various gods and goddesses for a Monster of the Week campaign, and I was researching Hel extensively, and then one day I just walked out and sort of *felt* her, and I had my first experience with her in an empty train station. It was only a week ago, but I've been having some sort of experience with her every day since. \n\nI don't really have any other religious experiences to go off of. My family is pretty strongly atheist, so I was raised believing that religion was scientifically disproven. I don't have any previous religions to draw off of, and I honestly don't know if that's better or worse. \n\nSo far I feel like she's been helping me be at peace with myself and the world, and she's helped me get through things that may have been otherwise hard. I've been able to find some things to offer to her, mostly coffee, but that's all I've been able to do. I'm also a writer, and I've found spoken pomes and prose to be a good way to connect with her. The only time I've felt a strong command from her was when I considered blood as an offering and she seemed to very strongly reject the idea. \n\nSo far it feels like certain aspects of the world around me are tied to her, or at least I'm able to connect with her through. I live in New York so I have much different surroundings to work off of then most, but certain streets, alleyways, stone buildings, and subway stations all feel like places where it's easier to connect with her through. \n\nI haven't built an alter yet, in some ways I can't, but I mostly feel a strong connection in places outside. When I do worship at home, I don't see myself as needing an alter, wearing a black mask in a dark room, looking out a window at night, or holding a sheathed sword to my chest have all worked in a similar way though. \n\nI'm still very new to this. I don't even really know what is or isn't appropriate in this senerio. Hel specifically feels like a very comforting deity, at least to me, but I feel a bit more afraid of the other gods. I'm also *very* neurodivergent, and I'm not even sure if I could properly worship most deities. \n\nReally I just want to know more of the community. It's honesty rather scary being in this alone. I've met one person at college who was also pagan, though I haven't gotten a chance to talk about it much with her. Other then that, most of my friends are accepting but a bit afraid, and my family will hopefully never know about this. \n\nAny advice? I just want to feel like I'm not alone. I know if my parents found out about this they might want me hospitalized, I feel like I need to know there are people with similar experiences as me.",

After that, I also have to get into contact with someone who is an adherent/participant of that church/religion and ask them just 3 short interview questions. I would preferably like something that is a livestream I am able to attend to since it'd be easier to do rather than having to go out to a physical location. If anyone has any suggestions for where I should look for either one I'd very much appreciate it. Feel free to ask anything if someone needs more context or info on the nature of the project, thanks!",

I wouldn't say God as in Islam it's the Angle Gabriel.\n\nA common thing I do think about is like defiently people were more gulible back then. Because now a days it's impossible to claim you heard voices from the higher up telling you about revelations to try and start a religion because people will think you're crazy even if you make perfect perdictions.\n\nBut yeah the whole hearing voices from the sky type of thing is very common with Abrahamic religions. But really what is it that made people so gulible back then that they would believe in these religions thousands of years from now but you try the same thing now it's basically like nope I don't believe you?\n\nWhat makes religion so hard now compared to back then? Is it the threat of hellfire that makes people want to spread it around because your own religion threatens you? I mean really Christianity could've believed in reincarnation but they really wanted to make a system of punishing people. While Jews don't believe in hell they don't believe in proselytizing to others. So I guess one thing you could do is threaten people who don't follow it but then again people will still call you crazy. Or better yet just say you know you will be attacked for your beliefs because I have seen Christians do the same like the whole they will mock your beliefs thus that makes it true when they do mock you.\n\nEven creating a new sect of Christianity is pretty hard because of how strong people are about their religion. What is it about old religions that believe in voices in voices talking to them and then saying this religion is true and then people believe in it even today?",

        "text": "Hello, \n\nI was wondering how was this community's sentiment about multifaith rooms or similar spaces that theoretically give a space for anyone in an office, university, or hospital, etc. to go to pray or meditate. \n\nPersonally, I really do love the idea. I'm Baha'i, so we do have some prayers to do during the day, so it's nice to know there is a space for that. Also, more generally to have a quiet space where one can reflect, take a break from the tasks of the day and connect to something deeper is something I really see as valid.\n\nI have been to some interesting ones, usually fairly empty rooms that rarely get used. However, right now at my university, multifaith rooms as they are called are mostly used by the muslim community. The space had been designed to be multifaith, but now it has carpets facing the Kaaba, a middle wall to separate men and women (that technically can be removed between prayer times), and is also used as a socialization space before prayer times. I'm really not against muslims having a place to pray, but honestly, I don't feel the space is being used for its intended purposes nor that it is particularly welcoming. \n\nBefore contacting my university with this concern, I wanted to ask if others have seen similar cases or are aware of spaces that are able to hold the dual purpose of being a safe and comfortable space for muslims who need to pray at certain times, and a welcoming space for everyone. What was put in place to facilitate this?\n\nThank you for your input! \n\n**TL;DR Some multifaith space are very inclusive. The one at my university is used by the Muslim community in a way that isn't very welcoming to others. Do you have any suggestion to make a space open to both muslims and non-muslims? Thank you.**",

I may not debate that, because there are many examples of ignorance in a religious context.\n\nHowever, personally I've found Sunday schools and biblical studies often helped me to learn and get interest in many things. These are some examples:\n\n1. An introduction about Semtic cultures and Middle East cultures, on which the first civilizations and writting systems were born.\n\n2. The importance of languages such as Hebrew, Greek, Aramean, and Latin in ancient times.\n\n3. A perspective of the evolution of history from ancient times.\n\n4. Consideration of how different the values and laws were on ancient times, and how alien some traditions were.\n\n5. The universality of human suffering, struggle and hopes, which can be found from Adam's story to the Early Church in the Bible, to this day.\n\n6. Bible studies also touch other cultures such as the Egyptian, Greek and Roman, which are paramount to understand ancient world. I guess the position of Israel helped.\n\n7. The spiritual symbolism and projection of new beliefs on ancient customs, and how these beliefs and traditions reinforce each other.\n\n8. A help to understand why we believe what we believe, and the history of the community.\n\nSunday studies often do not have any academic requirements, which makes people focus on the content for just interest only.\n\nI find Sunday studies one of the most interesting aspects of my faith, but other religions such as Judaism are even more intellectual on that aspect.",

        "text": "Describing events 30 years ago. I am not religious. Should be, I think.  \n\nI got visit from somebody in my dream. I was about to do something suicidally stupid and that visit(or) changed my mind. She explained me future without me. Until now I kept almost silent about it, I only told to my sister, wife, priest and shaman. And my kids, when they become adults.\n\nI will not discuss second event, as it involves child and third is yet to happen.\n\nOf visitor:  \nShe was she, she was sitting in Lotus position, also moved in that position, floating. She had orange robe with hood, but she did not wear hood. Robe material was thick but bright orange color, something hand made. Not like glowing neon signpost orange, normal bright orange color. Also belt in middle, but belt details I dont remember. Tied belt though. Nothing in her hands, no jewelry, nothing. Only visible skin was head and hands. She had black curly hair, shoulder length. She looked I think 50 years old, but when she talked, I somehow understood it more like thousand of years. \n\nIt was exceptionally clear dream. I asked her then in my dream, why would I believe hallucinations in my dreams. She gave me three events. Two have become true.\n\nFirst event, next winter after \"visit\":  \nI was conscript of 2 years in Soviet army, there was no options for me out of it, mandatory conscription and some bad stuff to you and your family if you did not.   \nLocation was Mongolia border with Russia and army base in hills there, 1500, 2000 meters of seal level.\n\nMe and some other guys were supposed to start our night watch at radar station on hill top. Few km uphill hike from barracks to radars. Snow was knee deep, sometimes up to my balls, very strong wind, still heavily snowing, complete darkness and we got lost somehow. How, IDK, this road we walked daily, either shifts or just as drill/punishment to run uphill.\n\nSo we were completly lost, no lights visible, started freezing, we were so tired, sweaty from heavy moving, panic was incoming and such, I think we were really at death\\\\severe injuries edge. I cant see any other outcome. Then it happened.\n\nLights got turned on. I cant described any other way. Clear, bright, milky white light directly above us. No sounds, quiet. Literal like very powerful daylight lamp, that cuts through clouds, snow.  I think, or it felt that even wind reduced. We suddenly clearly understood were we were and where to go, we found our way back to trail and radars eventually. Easy cold injuries,  noses, fingers and such.  \n\nWe tried to reason what happened, what lights.   \nFirst idea was that our detour was noticed, and radar station turned lights on. They did not have such lights. And how come abouve our head, kilometers away, through storm. \n\nThen we thought helicopter. But nobody then new that we got lost. No helicopter would fly this weather, nor find us from hillside, and be quiet and static. I think standing under low flying helicopter, cant miss it even in storm.\n\nSomebody said northern lights. But we had Nenets with us, he said he has seen all possible kinds of northern lights and it was not it. Considering weather, snowstorm, and clear bright static light above us. \n\nFirst person I ever told about this, was my sister. She was on tiers, \"i knew it, I knew it, this is true, I was right, I knew it\", asked her to explain, she did not, said it has come to me and it will come clear to me when time comes. We have not discussed it afterwards. \n\nPriest (if this is correct word, person who speaks in church altar), said it was Gods light and I am blessed. I said thanks and that was it.  \n\nShaman on this story: Tuva is religious center of Buddhism and Shamanism and I must have heard of lights on mountain Kailash. Same thing.  In his opinion, shaman in Mongol or Tuva side helped us by lighting our way. \n\nSecond event has happened also (or maybe ongoing), but is too personal as involves special need child. \n\nMyself, I dont know what to believe. UFO? And that dream, who was she, what did she represent? I am not even sure it is r / religion question.",

        "text": "I was in a Catholic elementary school in Bavaria from 1972 to 1976, which was run by nuns. These nuns were fundamentalists and sadists. They claimed, for example, that on the way home the devil would pull me into the maw and torture me. Threats of torture are also considered torture.\n\nLong-term consequences of this \"treatment\": various psychiatric stays, severe depression, anxiety disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder.\n\nI know, this is strong stuff, but I do not intend to criticize believers with this post, but would like to show how destructive people can be through their mindset.",
