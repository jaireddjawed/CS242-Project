She brought up points like how English doesn’t have things like grammatical genders, and while that is true, I believe that the irregularities in spelling, grammar and pronunciation makes it a pretty confusing language to learn to an actually fluent level.

        "text": "Hey, I am currently 21 years old, almost 22 and I was born in Poland. I stayed there until i was 7 years old and then I moved with my parents to Iceland. I grew up there, finishing primary school and secondary school. I also went to a saturday school for polish kids, to get a sort-of condensed fascimile of a typical polish cirriculum. I learned english through school and on the internet, consuming thousands of hours of videos and video games. Currently I am enrolled in a polish university, first year, studying Information Management. That is my life up to this point in a nut-shell. \n\nBecause of my ADHD I hated reading books, and I was really bad at making friends, so I never had an Icelandic friend group to practice conversational Icelandic with. This means that I learned just enough Icelandic to pass primary education, and because I went to a more tech oriented secondary school, I could slip by mostly speaking english. I dropped out of the polish saturday school when I was 13. \n\n(I am currently being medicated for both ADHD and depression\n\nBasically my situation is as follows: \n\n- I am a fully polish 21 year old guy that was born in Poland, spent my developmental years there, spoke polish everyday, go there on vacation every year, am currently living and studying there and I still feel like a foreigner everytime I speak it.\n\n- I spent 13 years living and studying in Iceland, going through primary and secondary education, and I am too embarassed to attempt to have a conversation with an adult in the language. The thought of telling someone I grew up in Iceland but suck at the language makes me feel like a moron. \n\n- I spent most of my childhood and teenage years consuming english-language content on the internet, which I had unrestricted access to. This caused me to think in english by default. Consequently I became too comfortable with the english language, which doesn't help me at university. Even though I understand it, my brain rejects the polish language, and I have a hard time focusing on it to read it or I just go the easy route and translate everything, so I can read more comfortably. Often in conversations I spent most of the time thinking of what I want to say in english, and then trying to create a polish version of it to say out-loud, which is very awkward.\n\nMy main life goal right now is to finish univeristy and move back to Iceland to get a good job and live comfortably. I would love to master (or at least come close to mastering) all three of these languages, to be able to proudly say that I am trilingual, and mean it.\n\nCan anyone relate to my strange situation, even at all, and do you have any words of encouragement/advice? Thanks for making it through my ramblings.\n\n**TL;DR:** Polish guy, grew up in Iceland. Never reached a level of proficiency in polish or icelandic that I should have at this age and suck at/feel unconfident in both. Somehow english became my default language, and I only use it online.

But I also do not know how one picks up vocabulary otherwise :D\n\nAny tips? Is this just how it is until I get to a certain number of words?

        "text": "When you are learning passively and testing yourself by having words written in the foreign language first, like you are with Duo, you are only passively learning to recognize words, but not enough to remember them once you need them, like you would with active recall, which stimulates your brain into remembering information when prompted for it.\n\nMore importantly, due to false confidence passive learning gives, you don't know how much you don't know until you get in a real conversation and suddenly forget half of the things, because they aren't written in front of you in the foreign language and you can't choose the right answer.\n\nAn app can be give you a hundred easy words like casa, adios, gracias, buenos noches and you can recognize them even if you barely speak Spanish. However if you were instead asked to translate \"house\", \"goodbye\", \"thank you\" and \"goodnight\" into Spanish on your own, you wouldn't answer as quickly or maybe you wouldn't answer at all. This is because you don't know all words equally and being able to recognize them is one thing, but being able to remember them on your own is a whole different thing.\n\nSome apps like Mango do fix this by asking you how to say English words in the foreign language and even using Spaced repetition, but even then they still have a crucial thing missing and that's the lack of context, when you learn new words there, you mostly learn them by themselves. There are some sentences as well, but not that much and they are only used in the reviewing part, instead of being used from the start in the learning part.\n\nThis is why people usually depend on immersive input to supplement the apps. The more context you get for a certain word, the better you can learn it and interconnect it with other words and topics that you already know. Learning what a socket is is much easier if you watch a home renovation show, than if you try to learn the word on it's own without using it in sentences or connecting it to things you already know. Obviously, if you just began to learn a language, you won't have the knowledge of other words to give you the context in the first place.\n\nWouldn't it make a thousand times more sense to create your own learning environment, your own targeted sentences with words that you already know and that give you context from the very beginning? Instead of you barely learning words in an app and then spending dozens or hundreds of hours watching shows or podcasts in the hope of your freshly words appearing in them, while not understanding half of what is going on? This isn't to say that you shouldn't do those things, you should immerse in the content, but purely for motivation and passive learning on the side, not for using that as your main method of learning.\n\nImagine if you could create your own sentences, verify their correctness and make them have personalized context that you won't forget, for example having one, two or three different sentences for a word, so that you immerse yourself right away, instead of relying on other apps or shows to do it for you. Well, you can do that and for completely free, by using Anki which gives you that functionality, while also having active recall and SRS, and you can verify the sentences using Google or DeepL. If you want to be extra sure, you can copy someone else's sentences from book courses or something and just make a personlized change here or there to make it more memorable to you. If you have a daughter, instead of \"the villagers daughter\", change it to \"my daughter\",etc.\n\nChange the target word itself from a foreign language into your own, so that you eliminate false confidence giving away the answer and that's it. Now you can create an infinite amount of your own learning matterial that uses active recall, that uses Spaced repetition and that gives you as good of a context as you can think of and with as many sentences as you want to. Even if you stumble upon a word that you struggle with, simply make a new sentence or two for it with a different context and thus immerse yourself more right away, instead of trying to learn by repeating the same sentence over and over and over like you would in an app.",

I've briefly started to learn the basics of both before but quit for different reasons. Now here's my dilemma:\n\nIn terms of practicality, French would be the obvious choice. I already speak two Latin languages, my parents speak it, and it's more widely spoken. The only downside is that I don't really like it or feel drawn to it, except for knowing that I could get conversational pretty quickly. \n\nOn the other hand, German brought me a lot of enjoyment, even when I was learning just the basics. I started learning because it was my ex's native language and stopped when we broke up, since I didn't have a real reason to know it anymore. I like the way the language sounds a lot more but I'm aware it would take a lot longer to get conversational or even achieve fluency.\n\nThinking about the future, I could see myself living in a German-speaking country (e.g. Austria or Germany) more than a French-speaking one, but neither is likely in the foreseeable future.\n\nWhile I know I have to make the decision for myself, I wonder if anyone found themselves in the position of having to opt between the practical and personal aspects when choosing a language to devote the next years of their lives to. Any opinions are welcome :)",

        "text": "I thought I'd share my takeaways from my goal over the last while to improve my listening skills. \n\nI see a lot of people post here looking for advice on how to improve their listening and getting the same advice from more advanced people to consume more content etc. While this may not be exactly what these people want to hear, I thought I'd share what I've done to successfully improve mine. \n\nAbout a year ago I got really serious about improving Spanish in the lead up to moving to Spain. I already had a Spanish major and had travelled a bit in Spanish speaking countries. I would say my level was  high B1 or low B2 but I've never been tested. My listening was atrocious. I find listening skills even in my own NL pretty bad. About 6 months ago I decided I wanted to address this. \n\nThis is what I have done:\n\nListening specific:\n\n\\- every week for 30 minutes I watch a movie or TV show and try to write down what people say, without subtitles obviously. Put the subs on to check your listening. \n\n\\- watching a LOT of content with or without the subs on.  I've alternated between not having subs on and having them off and settled that having them on is better for quickly looking to check I heard a word correctly and noticing visually new vocab. I know some people here say subs are a crutch but I don't think so. I think your brain naturally focusses on the path of least resistance, but I don't believe that means your brain literally becomes unable to listen to the sound. When you notice your listening skills improve you find you rely on them less, as your brain finds it easier to listen instead of read.\n\n\\- Listening to audiobooks or podcasts for as many hours as you can every day. Audiobooks have the advantage of lasting for 10+ hours and you can just chuck it on without worrying about what to put on. Right now I prefer them as I think trying to discern new advanced literary or technical vocab that was designed to be written, not spoken has been really good for my ear. I've set myself an ambitious target of books to read this year to it's lately been forcing me to listen more.\n\nAnother thing that has helped has been expanding my vocab substantially. Since November I've grown from an anki deck of 0 to 1000. I've focussed a lot lately on memorising idiomatic expressions. Once you memorise these they become big chunks of language and your brain doesn't have to focus on decoding the sentance word by word. Before anki I was reading a lot. I still read like crazy now and this has helped with listening quite a lot as I simply recognise more words. \n\nI know this isn't going to seem like a new hack to many people. It's not supposed to be. I guess this is to all the people I see posting on here looking for advice on listening and keep getting the frustrating advice \"listen more\". I guess I want to say I've been at that stage and felt like it was simply impossible to understand normal speech. But if you do put hundreds of hours in, over many months, you will see improvement. I'm also not saying I'm perfect yet, I still so far to go but from where I was 12 or even 6 months, it's night and day.",

        "text": "I picked up Duolingo in the spring and started on its Brazilian Portuguese lessons in the spring. I spent a few months doing just one 3-5 minute lesson per day, then around October I decided to add German. At this point I stepped it up from 1 lesson per day to a minimum of 3, so that I'm now completing about 1 unit a week in each language.\n\nI think I would make better progress if I focused on just one of them. I took 2 years of German in high school (many moons ago) and so I'm at about the same level in both of them, according to Duolingo, but my German is probably much better. I don't have any really compelling reason to learn German, except that I have this fantasy of taking a trip to Austria and eating a lot of cake in Vienna then going hiking in the Alps. \n\nPortuguese is less fun for me. I find the pronunciation difficult, and I'm not super drawn to the culture, but there are a lot of Brazilians where I live, and it's definitely the second-most-spoken language locally, after English. Spanish would be a very distant third, then a smattering of other European languages. It really would be more practical to learn Portuguese, and might help when applying for jobs here. \n\nIf I switch to doing just one, I think I'll find it easier to get into other resources, like listening to podcasts or reading books. The resources for German seem to be better, but I've found some for Portuguese, too. I just feel like I don't want to juggle both of them any more but I can't quite decide which to pursue further.",

Is there anything you are begging to see in an app or website, but no one else has implemented it yet? For me it is a website that helps people read Classical Chinese since Classical Chinese is still highly relevant to modern Chines. I'm just curious to see what you guys think. Thanks!",
