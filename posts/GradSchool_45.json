It's a very well known reputable program and also very expensive, from what I can tell it would be about $120k in the hole before any scholarships/funding; but it's also my dream school/top choice.\n\nI'm putting in applications to 3-4 other schools but I don't have much hope for getting admitted off the waitlist for my top pick. And even if I do get offered admission, I doubt that the funding would be as strong as the funding they give to flat out admitted students (if I even get any funding at all).\n\nShould I just accept that I'm not going to my top choice? I should have all my decisions from all schools by March and will be able to compare them all then, but just being waitlisted in itself doesn't give me much hope. I'm leaning towards not even worrying about it and just bumping my #2 choice up to #1.",

The problem is that my transcript was a train wreck of dropped classes and I dropped out several times in community College over 10 years or so before even attempting to get a 4 year degree. \n\nI was smart enough to understand the material but had real performance problems. 4 years ago my wife got me back to school after we married and kept me mostly on track but the real breakthrough was an ADD diagnosis right before I graduated. I came from a household where things like ADD weren't acknowledged as real so I never considered it a possibility. \n\nTreatment has cleared up a lot of my problems. My car is clean now which hasn't been the case for basically a decade. I'm a working engineer and it's fun but I want more advanced work. \n\nThis brings me to my basic question. I want to try to get an MS. Everything I leaned in undergrad was awesome but felt unfinished or basic. Now that I have the organizational abilities to actually appreciate an advanced education I'd like to try and get one. I'm just not sure it's possible and I was curious about what kind of program would even accept my dumpster fire of an academic record. \n\nTl;dr I had an ok GPA but bad transcript in undergrad but want try for an MS in mechanical engineering.

I'm a masters student in biology and I've been sending possible conferences I could present my research at to my advisor, and he finally got back to me and said that there is only one conference that people in his lab typically attend and regardless, he doesn't have funding to send me there before I graduate.\n\nI guess I'm curious about a couple of things:\n\nHow many conferences do people typically attend / present posters at / present orally at?  I'm very eager to attend and present multiple conferences to both pad my CV and, more importantly, network with industry professionals (COVID has not been kind for networking).  Plus presenting will help me get ready to defend my thesis.\n\nWhere do I look for travel grants?  How likely am I to receive them?  Is it even worth bothering or do they only hand out grants to PhD students?  I'm getting the sense a lot of resources are being withheld from me because I'm pursuing a MS instead of a PhD.",

I’m a mediocre student performance-wise, so I know that realistically I’m not gonna get in. However, I wanted to send my application because this application cycle might be my last one.\n\nI’m of low income and I was a scholar of a federal diversity program, so I would have qualified for an application fee waiver if I’s requested it. The problem is that I forgot and the application is due tomorrow night. I just sent the request but it takes 5 business days to process. \n\nThe school’s policy states that you can’t submit the application without having paid the fee, and they won’t give you a refund if you are approved for a fee waiver after the fact. The fee is $75 and that’s quite a bit of money to me. It’s like a comfortable week’s worth of food.\n\nAgain, I realistically don’t have a chance. Even my research mentor gently told me so (he’s a very nice person but was just trying to be realistic). But this may be my only chance to apply to that school. Should I pass on applying or cough up the $75 as a dumbass tax?",

This was a very generous scholarship, and if I had used the money wisely all four years of undergrad I wouldn’t be in the spot I’m in now. I grew up in poverty and was homeless multiple times. So the scholarship was my first opportunity to buy myself new clothes, eat take out, and go on a study abroad to Europe. I lived well and finally didn’t have to worry about money. Well that was nice while it lasted, but now almost of my savings is gone. My new town is going through a population explosion and rent is through the roof. I’m working two part time jobs and picking up a third next semester that will only pay for tuition. The two jobs still don’t cover my rent. I will not be able to pay my rent in two months. My bank account will be completely empty. I have no family to ask for money. I applied for a PLUS graduate loan but it will likely be rejected for approval by the school because it’s the middle of the semester and my fees are already paid. I have no idea what to do. I finally feel a shred of what my mom went through when we lost our house.

I am leaving my university with around 20K in student loans, which in theory, I am pretty happy with. I love writing, and I am extremely passionate about it. However, I am really interested in journalism, particularly sports writing. I feel like the safe choice is to apply to grad school and in a sense avoid the real world for 2 more years, but is this a waste? Anyone with a degree in English or Journalism I’d love to hear your thoughts.",

        "text": "Hi! I am an undergrad majoring in biochemistry. Grad school applications are due soon and I recently decided that I want to apply for masters in materials science and engineering programs. My concern is, I only took bio, chem courses, and math courses up to linear algebra. I have no background in engineering or advanced level physics, and materials science is heavily focused engineering although it is interdisciplinary.  I am in a research lab in the pharmaceutical sciences department, which I assume has nothing to do with materials science. Although I am majoring in a stem field, I feel like biochemistry is a lot different from engineering.\n\nShould I just apply with what I have or take a gap year and take some engineering classes and volunteer in a research lab? (although I am not sure if I can even volunteer because I have no materials background) Some people told me to just apply because there are many people who did not major in mse that got accepted. Or should I just give up lol and apply for programs similar to my major which is not what I really want to do anymore.",

My hope was that I could take these two classes and use one of the professors to write a recommendation letter. Ironically, one of the courses is taught by the director of the program, so I thought it would be odd to ask her to recommend me to her own program lmao. I got an A in the other course I took and actively participated in, and but it was only 3 months long. I'm considering asking that professor for a recommendation, but I'm worried that 3 months in his class isn't long enough for him to speak towards my abilities. \n\nI'm 4 years out of undergrad now, and my transcript was pretty weak (hence the non-degree seeking courses) so I'm not sure how I feel about asking one of those professors.\n\nI think this professor from my non-degree seeking course would be useful in basically saying, \"she was taking the program courses, and did well, and I think she would do well as a degree seeking student.\" \n\nIs it reasonable to ask a professor who I only spent 3 months with?",

Mental health has been the only field I've been able to see myself in since I was a wee lass.\n\nI thought that I could make myself power through this program because I don't actually want to be an LPC, I want a master's degree in the field. I chose this program because it's the cheapest and I've learned my lesson from choosing an expensive undergrad school.\n\nBut the sessions where I'm pretending to be a counselor with classmates for 20 minutes are killing me. I have anxiety and despite my best efforts I can't bring myself to try those anymore. I keep fucking them up. \n\nI'm not just letting my anxiety get the best of me though. I don't want to have to worry about being very multiculturally competent. I don't want to worry about keeping up with laws and a code of ethics and pay for counseling trainings when I'm pretty sure I don't even want to do counseling. \n\nAnd, literally all the counseling jobs with a MA in my area, except one, require you to either be an LPC or have counseling clients as a major job duty. \n\nI can't do this. \n\nI have until spring semester to decide, I'm talking to a lot of people about it and I will think through it best I can before I go through with it.
