Now consider the following Test cases of this theoretical Encryption Algorithm, with a special method called Offset(...):\n\n    A = 1;\n    B = 2;\n    C = 3; //C-B = B-A\n\n    Data_A = Encrypt(Data, A);\n    Data_B = Encrypt(Data, B);\n    Data_C = Encrypt(Data, C);\n\n    Assert.Same(Data_B, Offset(Data_A, B-A)); //Passes\n    Assert.Same(Data_C, Offset(Data_B, C-B)); //Passes\n\n    Assert.Different(Data_C - Data_B, Data_B - Data_A);\n\nThe key is the following basically:\n\n    Data_M = Offset(Data_N, 1);\n    Data_O = Offset(Data_M, 1);\n    Data_M - Data_N != Data_O - Data_M\n\nEven just offsetting by 1 repeatedly should result in effectively a random set of numbers, but it should always produce the same deterministic results.\n\nThe Range of the function should be extremely large and singleton, or repeating at exceptionally large frequency (like every quintillion or whatever)\n\nIt should be large enough that guessing what the input value and salt should be effectively impossible, but you can very easily determine the distance between two different hashes of the same input with different salts, but you don't know what either salt is.\n\nThoughts?",

        "text": "I'm really interested in CS theory, particularly combinatorics and cryptography. My background is primarily in math and I will be applying to a mix of Ph.D. programs in applied math and CS. \n\nI plan on taking the math subject GRE test later this year, since many of the applied math programs I'm interested in require (or strongly recommend) it. I don't plan on taking the CS subject GRE. That said, I would like to know if you think that listing my math subject GRE score on my application for CS programs would help or hurt my chances of getting accepted. Showing them that I'm good at math can't be a bad thing, but on the other hand I don't want them to think that I'm not committed enough to studying CS and that I somehow have a preference for pure math over CS (if that makes any sense). \n\nNote: this is assuming that my math GRE score is decent ~~ I'm scheduled to take the exam later this year. If my score is not that great, I'd probably leave it off any applications that didn't require it.",
