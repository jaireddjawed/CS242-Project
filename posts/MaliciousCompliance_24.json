        "text": "So this happened about a year ago now but I was just thinking about it and thought I'd post. So I worked in a four-star downtown restaurant in Detroit for several years. I wore many hats there from busser and bareback to host, server and landed in the kitchen eventually. Well on my way to management. I KNEW this place. Anyway, we had a new manager from another (much smaller) suburban location, filling in for our regular Friday night floor manager. There was a game AND a concert. We were slammed.  IDK how many of you have worked in a restaurant that seats over 900 people, but maybe you can imagine. Anyway, that day I was hosting, but after we were put  on a 45 minute wait just so the kitchen could catch up I started helping buss tables because we had 3 hosts at both entrances and I saw that my time could be spent doing something more productive than echoing two other people, telling people they have to wait. \n\n New manager: you're a host, where are you supposed to be? \nMe: we're on a 45min hold at the door, I'm trying to help clear these tables, the game starts in 20 minutes so EVERYONE is about to get up and leave. \nNm: let me worry about who needs to be doing what, go back to the door and stay there. \nMe: ok, no problem. \n15 minutes later, the restaurant is practically empty, shit fucked tables as far as the eye can see, floor covered in spilled beer, both bars burstimg at the seems with bottle and dirty dishes and where am I? Twiddling my thumbs at the door. \n\nNm: looks at me* think you can step in now? \nMe: I'm a host, I'm much too need at the door. \nThat was the last time I ever saw New Manager. He just couldn't take the downtown hussle. ",

        "text": "I used to work customer service at a massive credit and charge card call centre - we'll call them United States Speedy. Alright job, well paid but with a lot of annoying customers of the wealthy variety.\n\nHad a lady call up and say immediately after passing security that she'd been hit with another charge from us on her account, that she was sick of these and so would like to close her accounts. She had three of these and she'd been with the company for about fifteen years. \n\nHad a quick look and could see that she'd had about three over limit fees in the last couple of months, all refunded immediately and recognised that she was just angling for another refund on her latest one, having figured out that that old \"I'm closing my account\" line was a good way of getting us to bend over backwards.\n\nNow, the kick is that I'd have absolutely just refunded the fee if she'd just asked for it. It wasn't much and I had authority to do it. But she didn't. She didn't even say she'd close her account if we didn't refund the fee. She just immediately asked me to close her accounts, expecting me to plead with her to stay. \n\nAnd that got on my tits so of course I just did as I was asked. Said brightly \"sure, let me do that for you straight away.\" \n\nImmediately started the account closure process, gave her all the required scripts, said she'd receive her final statements. At various points, she had to give bits of info like confirming her address and you could here the struggle in her voice as she mentally debated whether to back out of the corner she'd put herself in and admit she just wanted a fee refund. \n\nFinally, at the end of it, she obviously realised that she was being an idiot and really wanted to keep the accounts open and said quietly \"you know, I'd have kept my account open if you'd just offered to refund the fee\". \n\nTo which I responded in my best pseudoflabbergasted tones \"really madam?? Well, why didn't you say that?? You're a long standing customer and if you just wanted the fee refunded, I'd have been very happy to do that immediately if you'd asked. We don't have any extra authority to do things because you threaten to close your account - if we can refund the fee we'll happily do that and if we can't we can't. Our policies don't change just because you say you want to close your account. But you said you were sick of us and wanted to close your account and seemed so adamant about your dissatisfaction that I thought it best not to argue the point as I thought it would just make things worse.\"\n\nSo she, a little happier now, said \"ok, great, so you can refund the fee and I'll keep my account open?\"\n\n\"Oh noooo madam, I'm afraid the accounts are closed now and I can't reactive them. I can't even refund the fee. If you'd like to reapply then you'll have to do so through our website. I'm afraid that the accounts I've just closed are legacy accounts though so you'll have to choose from the ones that are available to new customers and that don't have quite the same benefits I'm afraid. Oh, by the way, don't forget to let your husband and kids know that their cards won't work any more. Also it looks like you have fifteen or so standing orders going through the card every month. You'll need to contact these companies individually and give them alternate payment details, else the payments will be declined. Is there anything else I can help you with?\"\n\nEdit: as this seems to have blown up, I thought I'd respond to some of the common points, half of which say I'm some kind of hero and the other that I'm worthless trash that deserves to die. The truth is somewhere in the middle:\n\na) yes, this was a bit of a dick move. But, I assumed that she would back out of actually cancelling her account before it actually got to that point. It wasn't cancelled immediately - she had about seven minutes to do so, as I read her the several pages of compliance scripts warning her of the consequences of what she asked me to do. But she didn't. And, ultimately, she asked me to close her account and so I closed her account. She had every opportunity to stop me and chose not to. Hell, she could have just hung up on me and I couldn't have closed the account. \n\nb) I'm not going to get fired even if you dox me because I don't work there any more and haven't for years.\n\nc) Her life wasn't ruined. She had debit cards that she could use (I could see them on the account) and could easily have reapplied. She was just inconvenienced and would have had to spend some time putting this right. The biggest risk was her falling over while kicking herself for being an idiot.\n\nd) my name is Fuckus Nowman. Someone made a sub r/fuckus that I don't really understand but that scares me a little bit.",

He gave detentions to people for the littlest of things, he only ever gave detentions when it wasn't his turn to monitor them and once he gave out 100 detentions in one day. Also, when we went to PGL, he placed a whole bag of confiscated phones on the floor outside his window for the kids to reclaim as he thought they wouldn't stop ringing. If one got stolen, he would have been in hot water. Anyway, one time he was on a DS (Detention Streak) and gave out LOADS of detentions. On that day, I asked a few friends what they got detention for. One got detention for \"nearly being late\", another got detention for \"breathing too loudly\" and I got detention for not getting detention. Yes, you read that right.\n\nLuckily, the teacher who was currently on Detention Duty was withdrawn because of panic. The headmaster put the mean teacher on Detention Duty as replacement. The coward ended up cancelling all detentions until it \"wasn't \\[his\\] turn to do it\". I hatched a plan to get revenge on Terminator Teacher.\n\nBy going to detention anyway!!\n\nYou also read that right. I sent a message to everyone who had detention that day to attend it anyway as I had an idea. (It took a LONG time to send because of all the people it was going to.)\n\nDetention comes and we all cram into the detention room and sit down. So many people are in that some people are sitting on other stander's shoulders to fit. Eventually, the headmaster comes in, asking why some of us were being totem poles and why we were all alone. One kid chimed in before I could and said that the monitor never showed up. The head looked out the window and surprise, his car was gone! \"That must mean he left all of you here and went home!\" roared the head teacher.\n\nNext day, the head put the naughty boy on detention duty for the rest of the year. When he said he cancelled all detentions, the head asked \"why kids would go to a detention they didn't have?\"\n\nHe set the detention and you can't just cancel a detention, so we showed up!",

        "text": "This MC actually just happened several hours ago. I will give you a fair warning that this was more of a mild and crude bit of malicious compliance than some of the other stories on this subreddit, but I felt I should share it anyway. TLDR at the end and I apologize in advance for any formatting or grammatical errors (on mobile).\n\nI work for a beverage distributor on delivery routes. As you might imagine, the summer is the busiest time of the year for sales. Some owners take advantage of full pallet discounts and stock up as much as possible when certain items go on sale. It's usually not much of a problem for larger stores, but it can be a crazy mess for convenience stores, ma and pa shops, etc.\n\nThis is where Nitpicky Bitch comes into play. Picture a short woman in her mid-fifties with a permanent scowl on her face with 1980s Michael Keaton hair as grey and drab as her personality. She is known throughout our drivers to be an overbearing tyrant of the liquor store (attached to a shabby and slightly neglected economy grocery store) though not in any real position of official power. Since she is literally the only clerk in the store when we show up, she has taken it upon herself to make our lives as miserable as possible to make up for her wretched and pathetic existence.\n\nNow let's get back to the story. I was paired up with a veteran driver since the load was pretty solid and I'm in the training process of getting my own route. We get to the store in the early afternoon rather than in the morning because the actual manager refuses to come in early to let us in. The heat index was now in the triple digits for temperature and we were sweating like a gypsy with a mortgage before even parking the rig. The store took advantage of a special sale and ordered several hundred cases of beer. \n\nTo our dismay, the store was still quite stocked from last week (not much of a shocker there). Both the cooler and the floor were full or nearly full. Rather than get angry or complain about it, I decided to start hauling in some beer. Seconds after entering, Nitpicky Bitch looked up from her roost and starts following me. I checked the dates on the floor cases and get lucky (no need to swap out older cases) and rolled my cart up to the stack. \"Oh, no, don't bring in any more cases yet. You need to fix the shelves and the display. They look awful,\" she hissed. It was at that moment that I knew she was just trying to piss us off and make us waste time. The stacks were nearly perfectly straight, handles all the same way, and logos all right-side up. Even on the slightly crooked cases, it was clear that this was not our doing from last week and really her problem as a clerk and not ours. I complied and straightened up a few things. My partner wheeled in a stack himself and began to drop it, when NB demanded that he stop. \"We are going to conserve floor space. Customers aren't going to get through here. Drop the stacks here and here, but no more than two deep,\" she gestured in a honeyed voice laced with contempt. \n\nMy partner and I both cart in a few more trips worth of suds and it became abundantly clear that we will need to be creative in order to get pallets and pallets of beer inside while still \"keeping the floor open for customers\". Enter phase one of the malicious compliance. \n\nNB got tied up at the register with a few customers, so we got to work stacking cases. If we couldn't place any more than a few columns worth of beer width-wise, then we were going to stack them high. Soon, we were at least 8 feet high with beer with much more to go. My partner is 6'2\" or 6'3\" and was going until he couldn't reach, and I was doing a bit of a hop and toss to get the top ones on. After filling the floor spots as high as possible without a ladder or decent-sized step stool, we further complied by her nonsense by refilling the empty overstock shelves...as high as we could go with a step stool made of more cases of beer. NB finished up with the line of patrons and came over just red in the face and silently furious. There was no way she could reach even halfway up the rear stacks without a ladder. She even attempted to \"help us\" by handing us some cases, making sure to complain about the weight and how \"She's definitely going to feel this in the morning\". As I went up the custom-fabricated beer steps, I accidentally let a little gas slip out (it is after lunch, anyhow). \n\nNB was there in a flash, berating me for passing gas on the sales floor where \"all the customers would be disgusted and annoyed\" (it's vacant except for us now) and demanded that if I needed to further relieve myself, I'd have to do that outside. In all honesty, it really was some foul swamp gas that had been lurking in the dark recesses of my digestive system. I certainly didn't mean to let one out, but the rumbling in my stomach told me there was more to come. NB continued to micromanage my partner, so I left for more beer. \n\nI decided right then and there that I would passively get back at NB. It was hotter than blazes, we were covered in sweat, and it's our third to last stop on a Friday. Fuck it. I started wheeling in another cartful and let a real monster loose. It could be heard clearly over the racket of the truck idling. The door to the store was propped open and I came striding right through. That gave me an idea! NB was pretending to ignore us at the register, derping around on her phone...conveniently located near the entrance. Every cartload I brought in was preceded by a least a few pops or a good brap. NB was now busy with another straggler at the register and I made a point of strutting past each trip. By the time the stop was unloaded, there was definitely a real funk to the entryway. \n\nNB was \"fuming\" (okay, that was bad) and just signed off on the paperwork and stormed off. Sometimes, playing by the rules is the best revenge. \n\nTLDR: Since we couldn't stack cases of beer in a normal layout, we made them reach nearly to the ceiling, instead. Also, I obeyed the \"no farting inside\" policy by letting them rip in the entryway and crop dusted the register.\n\nEdited because I dun fergot muh vowels and werds are hard",

This July, water officials noticed that the water level was particularly low because of a bad winter. They local government decided to place a restriction on watering lawns on weekends to conserve water. The ultra-conservative citizens of Farmington blatantly ignored the restrictions in a typical don’t-stomp-on-my-personal-liberties fashion. \n\nThe city waited one weekend to see how it would pan out. The second weekend, the city took swift action. It handed out fines to over 400 households for $50 each. The city was quickly flooded with angry complaints. \n \nHere’s where the story gets a little hard to track. The city received a call where the caller said he was repeatedly going to “drain the reservoir”. The city shrugged it off as the typical harassment they’d been receiving all day.\n\nThe following week, the entire reservoir was gone. Somehow, the citizens have used enough water overnight to drain THIRTY MILLION GALLONS from the reservoir. There are no meters on the houses in Farmington, so the authorities have no idea how many or what people used all the water, but the authorities speculate that hundreds of people would have had to let their water run for hours to use it all up. \n\nThe city had tried to regulate water by banning watering on weekends, but malicious citizens deliberately used all the water on the weekdays. \n\n(Edited for clarity)",

        "text": "LTL, FTP, etc. Apologies in advance if this isn't quite right! TL;DR at bottom. \n\nI'm signing up for classes at a school that I've gone to for many years. Everyone knows me there, and if I have a question, I'll be as respectful as possible (the whole school has an attitude of 'You have a question? Then you're a bad student and need to pay more attention!'). They also assume the staff and teachers are always right and the students are always at fault - this discussion happens several times a year, minimum.\n'You didn't bring your extra supplies today? We sent an email reminding you!' \n(30 minutes before class, after most of the students have already arrived). \n'Well, you could have anticipated needing those supplies today.' \n(What am I, a mind reader?)\n\nOnto the present maliciousness...heheheh\n\nI decided to only take two elective classes this year, instead of the standard 3-4 core classes and 3-5 electives. I knew this would raise a lot of questions since I'm taking a weird combination of classes, and one of them is the highest level class offered and is very very difficult. You can't succeed in it unless you're taking at least 3 core classes concurrently. \n\nI went to the staff office to register in person and explain why I was doing this crazy schedule (I was taking all the other classes somewhere else). They cut me off abruptly and told me to register online. No chance of explaining to them that I wanted to do it in person to cut down on the confusion. So I signed up online and waited for the crazy to erupt. \n\nWithin three hours, I got a notification that I'd been kicked out of the difficult class, and later a separate message from someone else asking me to explain my plan for the year. I sent them a very polite email explaining why I wanted to take those classes and what else I was doing, with a nice line that I'd tried to sign up in person to explain all this to them earlier. At this point they've involved 2 staff members and the director and the discussion's gone on for almost a week. If they'd let me explain it in person, it would have taken 1 person and 15 minutes, tops. Their loss. I'm still snickering. ;) \n\nTL;DR: Don't want me to sign up in person, taking 15 minutes of 1 staff member's time? Then enjoy involving 2 staff members and the director in a confusing week-long email chain.\n\nExtra bonus: Last year I was chewed out by the director for not taking feedback I was never given. I pointed that out to her. 'Well someone probably told you that.' Uhhh, no they didn't! ",

Actually dropped the printers box on the floor; bad sign. Can't be returned now.\n\nK: you sold me an openbox!

        "text": "I believe in showing up for jury duty. I believe that it's important for everyone to serve if they can, because trial by jury is one of the bedrock principles of civilized society. It's a duty everyone should do at least once. I don't have a problem with being on a jury. I do have a problem with plaintiffs and lawyers who waste the jury's time.\n\nI was on the jury for a civil case. While a civil case is less likely to expose you to gruesome crime scene photos you can never un-see, it will very likely devour weeks of your life. Especially if the people involved have more money than sense. That was the case with my trial. \n\nTwo rich idiots, and former business partners, were suing each other over a contract dispute that could have been settled in an afternoon. Idiot A was owed $300K over a land deal and Idiot B wouldn't pay. Idiot B wasn't paying because he accused Idiot A of misuse of business funds and all sorts of sleazy behavior. Both of them wanted the other guy to fork over lots of money in damages, and the trial lasted three weeks as they lawyers drug everything out, trying to play on the jury's sympathies. This included one tearful witness who has to frequently pause because she was just so, so upset.\n\nThe jury stopped being sympathetic in the first week. You can imagine how we felt towards them after having spent two more weeks listening to those morons argue. I was especially annoyed because not only did this take up the entirety of a beautiful two weeks off I'd expected to spend relaxing, it then bled into what was supposed to be my first week back at work. Again, this could have been settled in an afternoon.\n\nHowever, the reason for this excessive court time became clear at the end of the trial when each side's lawyers began making the case for the money they felt they deserved. Each side tried to play on our sympathies for damages, money paid out in addition to the actual amount contested. Finally, the lawyers made the case for the awarding of lawyer's fees.\n\nBasically, how it works is that if certain conditions are met, one side can ask the other side to foot the legal bill. If I sue you, and it's established that I had a good enough reason to sue, you can be on the hook for my legal fees. That's what both sides were trying to do, and that's when it became clear why three weeks of my life were wasted. This whole trial was an attempt to justify the awarding of massive legal fees.\n\nIdiot A, who was suing for $300K, owed over 1.2 million in legal costs. So even if he won, he was still out $900K. Idiot B's legal costs were about $700K, again far exceeding the money he owed Idiot A. That's why neither side settled - they owed too much money to their lawyers and were gambling that the jury would see it their way and make the other guy pay those bills. \n\nThis is where the malicious compliance came into play. As a jury member, I took my oath seriously and made sure I followed the rules. We all did. So when we analyzed the case, we made sure to be as fair as possible.\n\nFor instance, it became clear that while Idiot A was a sleazy idiot, he indeed had a contract that stipulated that Idiot B should have paid him 300K. So we ruled that Idiot A was owed 300K. However, we also decided that this was all he was owed. We awarded no damages whatsoever because it was also clear he was a sleazy idiot and had been abusing his position. For Idiot B, since he should have paid Idiot A, we also awarded no damages despite it being clear that Idiot A was indeed sleazy. Contract says pay, you pay and don't be an idiot. \n\nNow, we the jury determined that both sides did do just enough wrong to establish that they were entitled to those legal fees. They met the legal requirements, so we discussed the legal fees they were owed. So we decided that yes, each side would be awarded legal fees. In fact, they would be awarded the same exact amount, $400K. But since both sides were awarded that amount, it really meant that they got nothing and were thus responsible for paying their own legal fees. I have to admit, I enjoyed the reading of the verdict. \n\nSo there you have it. Idiot A got his $300K but owed $1.2 million in legal fees. Idiot B not only had to fork over the $300K, he also had to pay an additional $700K in legal fees. Like I said, people with more money than sense, except in the end they had less money. \n\nTL:DR I was on a jury for a civil trial and we awarded the same amount for legal fees to both sides, nullifying the amounts. This meant that they money spent on legal fees was far greater than the amount being contested.",

You choose your degree when you're applying to the university and you do not have general education requirements. You do have some choice over what modules you do, but they are all related to your field of study - so for me, they were all related to English or Creative Writing (I had to take 2 English modules and 1 Creative Writing module per term).\n\nWe only had 10 contact hours per week (the other 30 hours we were supposed to self-study), so actual class time was a precious thing not to be squandered. Especially at £3,000 per year (back when I went to university - now it's £9,000 a year - this just your tuition and not counting your accommodation or living expenses). It's probably not much compared to US colleges but everything in cultural perspective, I suppose.\n\nIn one of my classes, my creative writing teacher insisted on going over grammar. My grammar is (mostly) fine (now that I've said that, someone will probably point out my bad grammar somewhere) - spelling and grammar should have been taught well before university level and it was a waste of time for most of us. We were not there to learn grammar - the module was about structuring short stories. Spending 3 hours a week (out of 10!) learning grammar was a complete waste of time and completely inappropriate for a university setting. I silently fumed about this misappropriation of contact time for a few weeks, hoping that we would move onto things that we actually needed &amp; wanted to learn. We didn't. Which finally resulted in the following malicious compliance:\n\nMe: This is a waste of time.\n\nProfessor: Well, if you don't like it, you're welcome to leave.\n\nSo I gathered up my things and left. There was no applause. No one followed me out. I was on my own, both exhilarated and mildly terrified. I didn't go back for the rest of the module.\n\nThe prof didn't like me much after that, but to her credit she still graded me fairly (got a First for that class and a 2:1 for the overall degree).\n\nWas I an asshole? Yes. But I was a satisfied asshole.",

        "text": "This is a rather short tale but I thought it made a nice addition to this sub I just found and am enjoying. I am a lead manager at a chain pizza restaurant, one of only 3 managers including our GM. Our GM loves to flip flop his instructions literally every week and never tells me anything even though I have to close (meaning deal with dinner rush plus clean the store and prep it for the next day) nearly every night. \n\nOne week he says get out right on time even if its a mess because labor, next week its focus on cleaning no matter the time, then hours, then forget all that lets focus on selling bread. He literally can not pick one thing to focus on. Not to mention he CONSTANTLY is yelling at our employees and causing huge amounts of stress to everyone. The stress he has caused all of us has actually lead to 7 employees leaving in 2 weeks leaving us super short handed.\n\nA few weeks ago he puts me on a busy closing shift with myself and two minors, meaning I have multiple responsibilities (since minors cant touch certain machinery) and not to mention even if they werent minors thats a super short staff. On top of all this he makes it CRYSTAL CLEAR that he did NOT CARE about the labor hours and everything had to be, in his own words \"Perfect.\" Not even just the usual cleaning either, he gave us a nice long list of various things he wanted done. Now after the store closes it goes down to just me and one other guy. We were SUPPOSED to be out around 10:30. \n\nI know labor hours are a big deal for us and if we went over them that our GM would be chewed out hard by his boss, but hey, he had been riding us all for weeks completely unnecessarily, gave us a huge list of ridiculous tasks to complete plus regular nightly cleaning, and made it clear it needed to be PERFECT. I made sure my buddy was in it with me and we agreed to stay as late as we needed to get everything done perfectly, regardless of how long it took and how much labor hours were used. It took us until 2am in the morning when we were supposed to be gone at 10:30. \n\nOur GM called repeatedly throughout the night and I, as the manager, simply answered his questions of \"Why are you still there?!\" with that we still much to do and that we were making absolutely sure everything was perfect. Going a total of 6 labor hours over in one day is really, really bad. Our GM ended up getting chewed out super hard, we weren't in trouble at all for following his orders, and he hasn't made anymore ridiculous requests like this since. I'm hoping hes learned his lesson!",

        "text": "I recently recalled an incident that happened a few years ago.  I'm a marriage and family therapist, at the time I was primarily working with court-ordered clients who had been convicted of domestic violence or substance related charges (often DUI crashes or larger possession/intoxication charges).  This is a particularly challenging population and many people in my industry refuse to work with them; however, it can also be incredibly rewarding.\n\nFor those who don't know, it is pretty standard for the judge to mandate therapy if you are convicted of domestic violence.  I always approached my job as trying to serve my client as best as I can - it helps their family be more secure, it helps them avoid consequences, and it helps change a long standing pattern of abuse so it doesn't get learned by the next generation.  I take this responsibility very seriously and the vast majority of my clients ended up turning things around.  A challenge with this population is that they don't actually want therapy when they first arrive, but their choice is to do it here or go to jail for violating their probation agreement and do it there.  Most just start by showing up and going through the motions; part of what I do is to help them get invested in their own treatment (not always easy).  \n\nIf someone is disruptive, combative, or absent,  I have to include that information in a monthly update to the judge.  Like most clinics, if you don't show up then you are often charged a no-show fee unless there is a good reason.  I tried to give people the benefit of the doubt, most were in a pretty bad situation in their lives and I didn't want to set them up to fail.  Unfortunately there are always some who try to take advantage of that and I have to ultimately hold them accountable.\n\nI had a client who was particularly disruptive, he was not only disengaged or combative in session, but he would frequently disappear for weeks at a time and only return once the judge's clerk sent him an Order to Show Cause (essentially saying \"get in here and explain why you aren't doing what you're told\").  Somehow he also managed to get his insurance to pay for his treatment; typically insurance companies won't pay for court-ordered therapy.\n\nOne day he arrived 25 minutes late to a 55 minute appointment.  I told him we would have to end on time as I had another appointment in the next hour, but he would still be charged his full co-pay (about $30).  He began shouting in the lobby that he would only pay for the time remaining in the session, that we were scamming him, that he would report us to the judge (go for it, see how that works out), and finally that he refused to pay at all but wanted credit for showing up despite the fact that he didn't arrive until 25 minutes after his appointment.\n\nI explained to him that according to the intake paperwork he signed, he understood the rules and this was not the first time we had this discussion - he could either pay for the session and I would count it as a late-showing (but present) or he could refuse it and it would be a no-show.  \n\n\"Then mark it a fucking no show!\" and he stormed out of the lobby.\n\nSo I marked it a no-show which means the billing office automatically charges him $50.\n\nTL;DR: Client demands that they be marked as a \"no-show\" for $50 instead of paying $30 for their session - so I do exactly that.",

        "text": "I posted a story earlier  from my days in working for a moving company: ([https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/91bk2z/cant\\_leave\\_till\\_the\\_moving\\_truck\\_is\\_full/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/91bk2z/cant_leave_till_the_moving_truck_is_full/)).\n\nSome details if you do not wish to read the previous post follow. \n\nQuiet Bull (QB) had a lot of moments of malicious compliance. He was the team lead for the moving crews and we took our directions from him. Strong and very capable at what he did. Never let his temper get the best of him at work even when pushed to limits. But had his way to deal with things as well.\n\nTL;DR Moving job where helpful suggestions and managing add more time to the move and the MC that followed. Resolution in last paragraph.\n\nThe job this time was moving a couple who where downsizing from their rather large house that they had raised their family to a smaller house. This was a 6 bedroom household with living room, dining room and separate function room bar, plus library, plus office, with basement and attic storage that was being downsized to a three bedroom house with a dining room and adjacent mother-in-law one bed and bath. Finished basement, no attic.\n\nThe husband was your usual academic type, friendly a bit aloof. We saw him at the beginning of the move and then we was gone 'till the end. The wife, (helpfull wife or hw) although very nice, was one of these people that needs to be involved in everything and somehow has suggestions even on subjects she knows little about. She was some sort of manager at a large company and used authority and 'nice manners' in equal measure. Pleasant but did not know as much as she thought.\n\nWe arrive at the property, meet husband and HW. QB having been there before for the estimate, starts directing us to which rooms are being packed and moved to the truck. He could eyeball a house and know exactly how much volume of stuff needed to be moved and how best to pack it to be efficient in both loading and unloading. While me and the other guys, there were four of us plus QB on this move, start setting up for the packing and moving, QB is getting blankets, boxes, tape etc setup for us.\n\nWife comes up to QB and starts asking what he's doing, very nicely. QB tells her that his staging the supplies we need to pack based on the how the rooms are going to be loaded onto the truck. HW asks what was the plan. QB stops what he's doing. Tells all of us to stop and come into the room with him and reiterates the plan as written on the estimate with all of us around to hear again. He then asks super nice, if this was ok with her.\n\nHW: well I'm sure you know what you're doing but it seems that you would be better if two of you were packing and the rest moving stuff. At least that's how I would do it.\n\nQB: Do you want us to do it this way? It's your stuff...\n\nHW: Sure if you don't mind.\n\nGrabs the clipboard with the printed paperwork and hand writes: \"packing/moving changes per customers request\" and has HW initial it. She asks why thats needed and QB tells her that we have a set procedure and when we change it's company policy to make sure that it's recorded so everyone knows the deal. HW initials next to the handwritten part.\n\nThe optimization in the process that HW asked for, even though got things moving at the front, caused issues on the loading as we would then have to move stuff around in the truck to make room for new boxes or furniture coming in vs prepping everything and loading the truck up with a set plan. Her suggestion just added time to our process but QB was not going to argue. It was her money she was buying our time with.\n\nHe splits the team up as to her suggestion and we proceed with our tasks. Every time HW would make a suggestion, QB would gather all of us, listen and adjust to what she was saying. If it was a dangerous one or if it would cause damage to the furniture/appliance QB would say that. HW would stop, think and then make a 'suggestion' that always started with 'how would you go about this then?' from QB.\n\nThe packing of the house took an extra 2 hours from the initial moving estimate. This included our having to do things the way of HW versus our system that we knew how to work. We would be asked to move certain things one way or go through a hall way there vs a doorway here to not damage stuff, or were to put things down. All sorts of things that were not help full and just added to the move.\n\nWe get to the new place and of course because of the 'optimizations' that we had to go through, we have no clear order of which rooms get unloaded first. Instead of unloading all items that go into one room in our organized way, we had bits and pieces that get dropped off in one room, scattered and in some cases are in the way. Again extra time that we could've avoided had we've been left to do it our way.\n\nMove is over. Husband shows up and QB is going over the contract with the couple. Husband notices that we're a good 3 hours over the original estimated time and asks why it took longer. QB shows husband the hand written part on the paper work and asks husband to go over the part where HW's initials are. That was 5 people at $12/hours for three extra hours. A move that should've taken tops 4 hours was done in 7.\n\nHusband looks at HW, looks at QB and just get's that look of : yeah, sorry about that. He then gives QB a tip to him and for each of us that amounted to $30 each and thanked us for the work with a slight apology and understanding in his look.",

Well not everyone is cut out to work in the snack bar and it stresses them out a lot. \n\nWell one such manager was working in the snack bar tonight, while I was working in the Cafe (an area adjacent to the snack bar that serves ice cream, coffee, and alcohol at some locations) which falls under the \"Snack Bar\" department but only has one person working it most days. \n\nWell I was in the stock room gathering things I needed in between customers when my manager calls me over the walkie to let me know I have a customer waiting for me. \n\nI rush up to my area and he's already helping them. When he finishes he turns to me and says \"when you leave you need to let someone know because that customer was waiting for like ten minutes\" (which, no. They weren't.)\n\nSo now, any time I set foot outside my area I called him over the walkie to let him know I was leaving. \"Hey (manager), I'm stepping out of cafe to get some ice,\" \"Hey (manager), I'm leaving cafe to put the ice bucket back in the cart,\" \"Hey (manager), I'm leaving cafe to help snack bar on popcorn,\" I made sure that I needed to make a separate trip for each individual task.\n\nThis went on for upwards of six hours and to my managers credit he stood by his instructions and never told me to stop. The other assistant managers and the senior managers were all laughing everytime I made a new call though. \n\nEdit: manager figured out what I was doing and would glare at me or shake his head when I made the calls. He was pretty much always within shouting distance and the reason I made the calls over the walkie was to out him to his co-workers and superiors. \n\nTl;dr manager told me to let someone know whenever I left my station and I did.",

        "text": "I just read the \"Bailey's and cream\" story, and it made me remember this petty MC by my friend Joey (not his real name). Sorry for the bad grammar in advance, English is not my mother tongue (also FTP and all that jazz).\n\nThere's a somewhat popular place in my town where my friend Joey goes at least once a week because the subs are really good there. He loves the ham sub, he would never order a different one.\n\nOne day, given the popularity of the place, the owner (I'd say in his late 60s) decided that he wanted to earn a few bucks more, and raised the price of the subs about a dollar. Of course Joey was pissed to find out the next time, as he saw this as a greedy move by the owner.\n\nHe also noticed something else, though: the owner somehow forgot to update the price for the \"ham and cheese\" sub, and only updated the one for the \"ham\" sub (both had the same other ingredients, so the only difference was the cheese). You see, the prices are written on a chalkboard, and you can add/remove ingredients from your sub, but the menu does specify the price for both the \"ham\" and the \"ham and cheese\" subs. It turned out the \"ham and cheese\" sub was now cheaper than the \"ham\" sub.\n\nSo for the following months, my friend Joey had the same conversation with the owner when he ordered his sub:\n\nJoey: I'd like a \"ham and cheese\" sub, with no cheese, please.\n\nOwner: You mean a \"ham\" sub, right?\n\nJoey: No no, the \"ham and cheese\" one. Just with no cheese.\n\nOwner: So you want a \"ham\" sub...\n\nJoey: \"Ham and cheese\", but...\n\nMy friend would insist so much that the owner would end up confused and charging him for a \"ham and cheese\" sub, making him lose a petty dollar every time. After all, Joey was ordering what was written on the chalkboard!\n\nI honestly don't know if the owner ever found out, but one day I went to this place with my friend as he was telling me this story, and it was hilarious to see that it actually worked.\n\nEDIT: To clarify and answer a few comments, this is just a family business at a small town run by the owner and his wife. This is also not in the US (just using dollars to keep it simple), there's no competition around and they're still in business, so I hardly think he raised the price to stay afloat. He would type the prices in the register by hand, so he would only rely on what he had written on the chalkboard.",

        "text": "TLDR: Makes a customer eat their words literally. \n\n\n\nFor a year I worked at a texmex restaurant known for serving a spicy ranch dip and people were always absolutely apeshit about getting it as fast as possible and as much of it as possible. \n\nMost interactions started like this. \nMe-  “how are you-“\nThem - “CREAMY CRACK” \nMe - “Sure I’ll bring that right out would you’ll also like some waters or sodas to go with that?”\nThem - “......we just want the white sauce.”\n\n\nLike literally these fucks would forget the whole way a dining experience is supposed to proceed. And they called this sauce anything and everything . \n\nWhite sauce (when it’s a very pale green) \nSour cream sauce (there is no sour cream in it) are just a couple but the most annoying thing is when someone calls it ranch. \n\nWe have ranch also. What the fuck are you doing asking for something by what you clearly know is the wrong name. \n\nBack to that normal table experience though. \n\nComing back with 2 bowls of this sauce for 2 people \nThem “that’s it? Um we’re gonna need more than that, are you new? Also I need a Dr Pepper like right now because I can’t eat this without a drink”\n\nSeriously it went like this damn near every table. \n\nThis was also a private college town and college kids that frequently go out to eat are usually bad tipping shit heads, worse so private college students. \n\nSure if you don’t go out often you are a good tipper but most college students servers see are using mommy and daddy’s money. They don’t want to give you any of mommy and daddy’s money so $1 tips were common. \n\nAnytime I could stick it to the regulars who were shitty tipping college students, I would. \n\nI’ve chased down multiple college kids into the parking lot and berated them for not signing the receipt that they also wrote zero for tip on. Always shouting loudly, “hey guy that didn’t tip I need your signature!!!” \n\nI’ve made a 50 year old woman who wanted to dip out on paying 52 cents search her car for change then counted back 3 pennies to her slowly one by one just because I wanted her to have exact change after all her searching. \n\nMy favorite though was when a group of about 10 college age people come in at peak rush on a Friday. This is terrible for me because they are here to waste time and are going to be my whole section. I’ve just lost probably 90$ just because now I can’t turn tables during rush and a good tip is unlikely. \n\nBut then the greatest thing happens, they ask for ranch. \n\nSorry they screamed for ranch. Lots and lots of “that ranch sauce stuff!” \n\nWell correct me if I’m wrong but ranch is a sauce right? And I guess if it’s a sauce it must also be sauce stuff right? \n\nI bring them each there own ramekin(bowl) of ranch and watch them have at it. At first I thought “hey any second they are gonna know.” But not one said a word. They were drinking the ranch practically. Tables all around them are asking for the sauce by its actual name and it just doesn’t click. One of the girls tell me that the sauce is really spicy today. I told her weird because it seemed mild to me....\n\nOn my last check back with the table I asked “any more ranch for anyone?” Which everyone said no thanks they had enough and in fact they felt kind of bloated (it’s 105 outside even at night this summer.), which is when I have to say, “yeah I’ve never seen anyone eat as much ranch as you guys, youll must be real fanatics!” \n\nI wish they haven’t been completely oblivious but in the end they just  waddled out of there without a second thought. \n\n",

        "text": "Tl;dr at the bottom! \n\nMany years ago I managed a store at a fairly large corporate book chain. While other book chains were going out of business, ours was thriving: we rented our store locations instead of purchasing them, so we were able to shut down underperforming stores quickly and since the economy was bad corporate was able to procure low rents when opening new locations or negotiating new contracts for existing spaces.\n\nBut while the company itself was booming, a raise freeze was in effect at stores and had been for about two years. It was pretty demoralizing to know that no matter how hard you worked, you wouldn't be able to receive a raise. But when I got promoted from assistant manager to store manager, I realized that raise freezes were only in effect for people who stayed in the same position: if you got a new position, you could get a raise since you were moving up the food chain and taking on more responsibilities.\n\nIn addition to management positions, we also had specialist positions available. There was a merchandising specialist who changed the discount stickers ever week and set out best seller and new arrival sections. Magazine and sale book specialists put out the new merchandise in both sections. And finally, we had a specialist in charge of putting all the nonbook merchandise out and making sure they were properly discounted once a week. These were things like reading lights, pens, keychains, toys, etc.\n\nOnce my promotion went into effect, I hatched my plan. I spoke with all my employees and explained that I had found a loophole in the system, and that I was willing to give them a temporary promotion if they wanted so that they could get a raise. They could pick one of the positions to learn, and they would be promoted to specialist and get a raise. Then, once the raises went through in a few weeks, they would would be stepped back down to a cashier position but keep their raise (this was possible and all on the up and up according to corporate policy because it wasn't technically a management position). Then we'd rotate someone else in and repeat the process. At the end, the people who were originally the specialists would regain their original positions and would also get a raise.\n\nWe had a small staff of around 20 including my management team, and not all employees wanted to participate - some only worked a shift or two a week, and one full-time cashier wasn't interested in learning anything else because then people might expect more out of him. But the rest were fully on board. I rotated it pretty carefully so my district manager didn't have to rubber stamp three positions at a time, and within 4 months all employees who had participated in my plot had received the maximum allowable raise. \n\nAs a bonus we now had at least three people trained in each position. Some of my specialists had lots of vacation time socked away that they never used, because they knew their sections would be a mess if they were gone for very long. Now they were able to take their vacation time or call out sick, knowing they had backup. And the newly cross-trained cashiers enjoyed getting a break from the register sometimes to work on projects. In fact because they knew the store much better, it made them better at upselling - if they noticed a customer was getting a book by a popular author for instance, they would show them other books by that author in the bargain book section - and soon we saw a strong improvement in sales overall. It's almost like happy employees do a great job! What a shocker.\n\nTl;dr: a raise freeze was in effect for the company except in case of promotions, so I gave everyone promotions like I was Oprah giving away cars.\n\n(Edit: fixed a spelling error because my husband pointed it out and it was driving me crazy.)",

He recently passed, and I got the chance to exchange some stories with coworkers and friends of his, and one of them fits here just perfectly.\n\nSometimes, in his position, my grandfather would have to pull planes in &amp; out of hangar buildings when they were to be serviced. It’s also a required practice for there to be spotters around the aircraft, to alert whoever is pushing the plane backwards that they may be near an obstacle.\n\nThis must’ve been a very busy day, as when grandpa needed to back a plane out of the hangar, there wasn’t anyone ready to guide him out. So if course, he radioed his supervisor to ask for spotters. Grandpa will be G, supervisor will be S.\n\nS: “We need that plane out pronto, just push it out.”\n\nG: “I can’t see a thing on the other side of the plane from the nose, I need spotters”\n\nS: “Stop whining and just back out the plane.”\n\nSo grandpa, having just received a direct order to break FAA regulations, hooks a tug up to the front wheel of the plane, and starts backing it out of the hangar.\n\nAnd to absolutely no one’s surprise, he backed the plane into an obstacle. More specifically, that obstacle was another plane, which was currently in the process of boarding. The tail of the backing plane, and the leading edge of the parked plane’s wing had just had a wonderfully loud marriage.\n\nNow of course, this is bad enough, colliding two planes together. But don’t worry, it gets worse.\n\nThe plane being backed was an MD-11. Quite an uncommon plane, and at the time, parts were very difficult to locate. Grandpa got the day off w/o pay, I didn’t hear any more stories about the supervisor, and the airline paid somewhere in the high six-figures for parts to repair the MD-11’s tail.\n\nTL;DR - Supervisor orders mechanic to back up a plane without spotters, it collides with another plane, &amp; there were no more stories about supervisor. \n\n\n\n",

I also have grit and determination from my days picking up cans for extra money and working outside all day with my dad. Thanks to growing up poor and being the eldest of (now) six children, I learned how to figure out what people’s intentions were and how to “read between the lines.” Needless to say, my determination, intelligence, and ability to analyze a situation unify in me to form an unholy trinity, a trifecta of terrible that hasn’t been seen since 2000’s Charlie’s Angels. I was born for Malicious Compliance. Now, on to the story!\n\n\n**Background for the MC:**\nUpon graduating from Really Good School, I came back to my local town to be with my family and start a fledgling career (because I disliked the US Northeast, where the School is; it all seemed very “gray” to me). I got a Crap Job just to get some cash rolling in, after which I worked for a bit at a startup. I eventually got a job in a Government Agency in my area, making about double what I was at Crap Job. Government Agency is where this MC takes place. Now, this Agency—specifically, this county’s office of the Agency—is known for having awful turnover, slimy employees, and just generally being a stressful and unwelcoming place to work. In addition to the awful culture, the “clients” (being very euphemistic here) are generally the worst that society has to offer. Thus, this job is an all-out drain on just about every conceivable metric or dimension. That being said, it was a significant amount of money for my relatively young self. \n\nWhen I was offered a position, I took it with about as much happiness as one can muster knowing they’re walking into hell itself. Note that I started in May. I worked hard to deliver the best performance I could; I read the 350-page plus manual (on my own time, even!), I would work here and there off the clock, I would help out my coworkers even if it meant I would be working more hours in a week than I wanted to (you know, reciprocity and all that jazz). I would sometimes go into the office at 8am and not get home until 2 or 3am the following morning; I had to skip out on dates with my then fairly serious girlfriend that I had scheduled months in advance due to being called in to work (and would end up working until the wee hours of the morning). Suffice it to say that I was consistently working much more than I wanted and I was only being asked to take on more responsibility as I continued to show competence. I met with my Supervisor, who would usually offer platitudes and state things like “that’s the way things are here,” “it’s for the good of the Agency,” or “the best employees are those that sacrifice and work hard for all of us.” While she seemed like a nice woman outside of work, a small but growing piece of me began to despise these “meetings” and everything that was discussed in them.\n\nNow, again, I started this job in May. By July, I was looking at various exit plans, should I decide to jump ship like so many of my most-qualified colleagues. I contacted an MBA program I was interested in, and was told I should apply. Within a couple of days, the Director himself was contacting me, asking me for a personal interview; this interview lasted all of 15 minutes before he thanked me for my time and ended the Skype call. Before the week was over, I was told via the Director’s email that I would be given a scholarship that covered all my tuition and supplied me with a (small, yet very useful) stipend, so long as I agreed to work as a graduate assistant for 20 hours per week while school was in session. I was *ecstatic*; I couldn’t respond to the Director with my signed acceptance fast enough. Within a week, I went from wilting under the oppression of escalation of responsibilities to being enrolled in an advanced degree beginning in January of the following year. This left me with around five months to kill, so I figured I would probably just tough it out at the Agency and save up some cash for my return to school. \n\nBecause I’m an honest person, I spoke with my Supervisor about my situation, explaining that I would be leaving at the end of December as I had been given a very lucrative package for an MBA program. She stated that she was thankful for my work thus far and happy for my success, would think about our options moving forward, and would get back with me soon. A couple of weeks roll by, each hour siphoning part of my soul like a river carrying sediment from its banks. Finally, I am called into a meeting with Supervisor. She informs me that I can stay on as an employee, but the Agency (and herself) would really like me to transition to what I’ll call a “contract position.” She says that they need me to move out of my position so they can create a job posting and prepare it for a new hire. She states that it is for the “good of the Agency” and “something an upstanding, hard-working, ethical employee like myself” would and should do. Remember these words, they’ll come up again later. I asked what types of changes this would bring, and she summarized them. Not being content to take her words at face value (she was a good supervisor, but I’ve learned in life to never sign or do anything without reading it yourself), I asked for up to a week to make my decision and the paperwork detailing all the changes in benefits, work responsibilities, etc. She told me she would get that to me the following day. \n\n\n**The Compliance Begins:**\nThe next afternoon, she handed me 12 double-sided pages detailing the relevant information I had asked for; each page filled with size 10 Times New Roman font that caused word to blend into word, sentence into sentence, becoming so difficult to read that even the most diligent of readers would find themselves slipping into unconsciousness. I read over this paperwork the following evening, with my mood slowly becoming more and more sour as I read each sheet. I noted that I would lose all of my benefits (except my banked overtime hours), would be moving down a rung in terms of what I was qualified to do, and would lose many other “perks” of the job. However, about halfway through my 12 Labors, I perked up instantly. Hidden within the depths of the bowels, I discovered that I was *mandated* to work a maximum of 40 hours, and I was *strictly* *prohibited* from performing many duties that I hated doing anyways. Further, I was to do *only* *what* *this* *guide* *outlines*—in other words, once I finished what I had to do, I was done. As I read over this finest of fine print hiding in the amalgam of legalese, a grin began to form. First small, like the smirk of a bored-yet-polite date; then bigger, bigger became the smile as I formulated a plan in my head. Plastered on my face was an ear-to-ear grin beaten only by the Grinch. I knew what I was going to do; I was almost too giddy to sleep.\n\nThe first thing I did in the office the following morning was pop into my office and begin to prep myself for my meeting with Supervisor. She was happy to hear that I would be accepting the new position, though, truth be told, I was far more happy than she could ever imagine. After handing over all the signed paperwork, she began to instruct me as to what I would be doing the following two weeks. I quickly, yet calmly, informed her that I was unable to comply with her request, as I considered myself to be an honest, upstanding, and ethical employee and I wished to maintain compliance with all policies and laws at all times. She looked at me, the confusion in her face nearly but not quite masking the anger boiling below at my seemingly callous rejection of her instruction. I informed her that under the employment policy I was currently contracted under, I was unable to do several tasks that I routinely completed prior. I also informed her that I was unable to work any overtime; I was to *immediately* *stop* and return home once I hit 40 hours. Further, I would no longer be working, in any capacity, off the clock, unless I was logging the time, because that would be a breach of my contract—again, I am honest and ethical and cannot fathom breaching said contract. I informed her that upon hitting 40 hours, I would be unable to answer work-related texts, calls, emails, or other communications until the following Monday morning at 8am; any priority correspondence would need to be escalated to my colleagues or the on-call staff. In addition, due to my new contract, I would no longer be able to be a part of the on-call rotation; she would need to find a replacement for me on the on-call schedule immediately (which is no small feat).  I explained that I would no longer be able to help my coworkers in many of the ways I had done previously, as I was no longer able to sign paperwork or, generally, no longer had the credentials (or time!) necessary to complete the work. I could practically feel the daggers shooting at me from her, the intensity increasing to a full-scale barrage as I detailed that which I could not do.\n\n\n**Compliance for You, Compliance for You; Everyone Gets Some Compliance!**\nUnfortunately, this was not enough Compliance for this straightest of arrows. After all, I *AM* an ethical, honest, hard-working employee, and I wanted to make sure that my steadfast dedication to being proper was known. Upon leaving Supervisor’s office, which unbeknownst to Supervisor was invariably going to become Ground Zero in a matter of minutes, I returned to my desk and began drafting an email. You see, in my (now former) position, you are required to undergo a significant amount of training before you are “qualified” to sign off on all contacts you do and all paperwork you file. If you don’t have this training and the “clients” find out, their lawyers can have the judge ream you (and the Agency) hot and heavy in court. Because of the county’s ineptitude, I never received this training and was expected to perform from Day 1. All my previous requests were pushed into a “this will come later” category and forgotten in a dusty corner like so many NeoPets of the early 2000s. Thus, I began writing. I directed my email to my previous Supervisor, the Office Manager, and the Area Director, as all of the sad, neglected emails before. However, for good measure, I BCC’d the Big Boss Lady who was my contact in the Central Office and her Bigger Boss Man—side note, networking and being a generally friendly and pleasant person is something I do as much as possible, it **really** pays off when you need it. I informed all parties that I was curious when I was going to receive the training I had been promised several months prior, as I had been working on cases without technically being qualified and would continue to work on them until the transfer to other workers was complete. Within a few minutes, my email dinged with a response to all from BIGGEST BOSS LADY, the highest office in the Agency (at least at the State level). She related that she was saddened and disturbed to hear about my situation (she stated that she heard it through the grapevine, so as to keep my name clear and free from retaliation) and informed me that she would personally ensure I obtained the required training. She was also aghast that I was essentially forced to take a demotion in order to maintain employment, so she ordered my supervisor that my salary was not, in any circumstance, to be lowered (after all, a young person like me needs to save for college, right?). \n\nNow the critical thing here is that I was being trained for a position I no longer held, so it was already a bit of a silly thing to be doing. Further, I knew that the typical training school wasn’t in session, so I would have to be put up in the state capitol for an “emergency” session—read: only myself and a few others across the state in similar situations attended this training. Because the capitol was a significant distance from my home, I was required by the almighty *Policy* to be given a hotel room and receive a significant stipend for my meals. However, thanks to my sleuthing the night before, I discovered that there were some major events in the area. Because of these events, I informed the Big Boss Lady at central office that I wasn’t able to secure a fairly priced hotel room within a reasonable distance from the training location. This would be a breach of their side of the contract, and it would be their burden to find me a room. Thus, Big Boss Lady used her credentials (and BIGGEST Boss Lady’s name) to secure a suite at a lovely hotel that was nothing short of the pinnacle of cosmopolitan glamour (at least for this region of the country). \n\nThe following week comes and I begin my drive for a week of training, singing with glee as I’m moving closer to my destination. Remember, this training is for a position I no longer occupy and have no intentions of ever occupying again—I wasn’t entirely focused, to say the least. I spent the week doing nothing except enjoying a very luxurious suite and relatively expensive food (and some cool events in the capital). In effect, I got a paid week’s vacation even though I technically no longer had benefits. Upon returning to my home office, I noticed that two workers in my unit had quit (and more in the office at large) and things were bordering on insanity due to the news that broke to BIGGEST Boss Lady two weeks prior. After my email, she did some digging and saw the travesty that was our office. She acted swiftly and without prejudice; she swung down the Mighty Hammer of Bureaucracy with all the strength of a Greek god, and the office was feeling it. However, because of my new status, I simply had to do what was specified in my employment contract; due to said office’s ineptitude, I was able to finish in about 20 hours or so each week. In addition, due to the chaos that the office was feeling with everyone catching up on training, I was asked to do things that were as simple as driving things from one location to another, sometimes across the state. I “lamented” that this would take from my standard tasks, but I was willing to do it for the Agency. This allowed me to log hours that were both relaxing and simple (and occasionally allowing me to hit 16 hours in a day while doing nearly nothing and claiming mileage). In short, I was able to sit there and watch the world burn from the serenity of my desk, headphones in and music playing. \n\n\n**The Beautiful Resolution:**\nThe remainder of my time in the office was spent like this: I would do simple tasks; when finished, I would sit at my desk doing absolutely nothing (read: dinking around on the Internet, watching YouTube, and so on) until I hit 40 hours for my week. I would often be able to go home for the “weekend” on Wednesday afternoon or Thursday morning. My life went from a living hell to a rather balanced experience; one in which I was able to love life again, spend time with my girlfriend, and (shocker!) enjoy some video gaming and other hobbies of mine. I was able to use my significant overtime bank to fund a cruise to the Caribbean that November. I was trilled to be able to go on this trip, as a large number of my life-long friends were going. The once powerful but now (relatively) humble Supervisor meekly wished me a good vacation and expressed hope that I didn’t return and quit. I joked with her, chuckling that I couldn’t promise anything. I enjoyed my week in the warm waters and islands (I’ve been on several cruises, so I know how to enjoy them) and I thought about what I wanted from my life, my job, myself. I returned the following Monday and waited for Supervisor to come in. As she walked in, she knew what I was going to say. I watched the happiness from strolling into the office at a leisurely 9:15am drip off of her, leaving in its place a desiccated husk of a woman. I informed her that I was unfortunately unable to make it to the end of December; I would need to be leaving two weeks earlier than anticipated, due to “unforeseen challenges” with my coming transition to the MBA program. She had the grace of a beleaguered manatee as she said “I understand; thank you for your service to the Agency for these 6 months and I will be sad to see you leave.” \n\nThat, dear reader, is the story of how I was able to turn my “demotion” into a free week’s paid vacation and nearly four full months of easy work. Further, I was able to turn my Supervisor’s words against her, as I began to be the model ethical employee who did everything strictly by the letter of the Policy, causing chaos for the office for the coming months as they scrambled to deal with increased scrutiny from the central office. A treat for those who made it to the end: I spoke recently about the situation with my current girlfriend (met her at this Agency, she’s absolutely wonderful and makes me happier than I have ever been—I think I’ll end up proposing and marrying her). She informed me that both of my “supervisors” as well as the Office Manager and Area Director had been forcibly removed one by one after I left by the BIGGEST Boss Lady. \n\n\n**Thanks &amp; Final Remarks:**\nThanks to all for reading this! I hope that you enjoyed reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it and reminiscing! For those who may be curious, I finished my MBA program without a hitch, hitting a 4.0 as I walked the stage. I’m interviewing for some jobs this coming week (had a bit of a fallout with a job I expected to come but has ended up taking too long to form); I should be nearly doubling my income again! I’ll try to be active in the comments, but I am pretty busy, so please don’t mob me unnecessarily. Like I said at the beginning, I was basically born for MC, so I have other stories—I’ll try to share these from time to time. If I should post this elsewhere, do let me know! I’d like to let as many people revel in this juicy story as possible. Thanks again, and I wish great things for all of you fellow Compliers or Compliance Enthusiasts (read: lurkers). \n",

Kevin hated the pot wash and really didn't like doing it and most of the time just wouldn't do it and leave it for the morning KPS. \n\nSo, me and someone else I work with really well we'll call Brian have a system where who evers turn it is in the pot wash just keeps washing and then the other guy who is doing the plate wash just goes down and fires some plates in the machine before coming back to the pot wash and clearing the drying rack for the other guy, it works really well and means you can chat with each other. Kevin didn't like this system. He would just leave the pot wash guy to wash everything and put it away theirselves too while he sat at the plate wash on his phone.\n\nOne day I said to him for like the 5th time if he could just follow the system me and Brian have and his response was \"oh no I just stick to my own section\" so obviously the next day when it was his turn in the pot wash it was busy af and I  remembered what he said and just sat at the plate wash with my arms folded watching him rushing about putting pans away with a red face while the chef's were shouting at him to hurry up because they were running out of frying pans. \n\nThe next day he was on shift with Brian and told Brian about how he wanted to punch me in the face for what i done (failing to see the irony in that sentence as I wanted to do that every shift I had with him and I was literally following his lead) but it was Kevin's turn in the pot wash that night too and Brian just done the exact same thing to him as well that night haha.\n\n He actually got worse after this and eventually got fired for it a few months later \n\nSorry if this is a big read and formatted badly but I'm on mobile",

        "text": "Been lurking here for a bit and decided to make a post! I can't think of any corporate stories (yet) but instead I'll share what I believe is my earliest occurrence of malicious compliance... Which goes back to when I was 11.\n\nThis was back when minutes on cell phones were a thing that people really worried about. We were on Sprint and had unlimited nights after 9 PM, weekends, and Sprint to Sprint calls. However being a kid I don't believe my dad thought I would respect the limits of our family plan, so he made me treat minutes like they were some incredibly rare item. Either way, at one point he established the rule of no calls to be made until 9 PM, since that was when my unlimited minutes kicked in. One evening he was out grocery shopping and I had put my phone on silent. I noticed he had been gone for a while and checked my phone, it revealed I had a few missed calls from him! Even a voicemail! I checked the voicemail and it said something like \"Hey SRSDisturbed, its Dad, please call me when you can.\" Now normally I would have called back immediately, we didn't have texting at the time so our only phone communication was limited to calls and voicemails. However it was about 8:30 PM, and my dad was very clear about no calls before 9 PM! So since I finished up my homework I figured I would play some PS2, wait for 9 PM to roll around, and give him a call then if he still wasn't home. About 15 minutes later I heard the garage door open, my dad opened the door, I said my hello to him and he looked at me silently fuming. Our conversation went something like this:\n\nDad: What are you doing?\n\nMe: Playing video games.\n\nDad: Did you see that I called?\n\nMe: Yes.\n\nDad: Why didn't you answer your phone?\n\nMe: Because it was on silent and I didn't hear it ring.\n\nDad: Why was it on silent?\n\nMe: Because I was doing homework and didn't want to be distracted.\n\nDad: Did you check your phone?\n\nMe: Yes.\n\nDad: And what did it say?\n\nMe: It said dad called.\n\nDad: AND WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL DAD BACK?!\n\nMe: Because you told me not to call anyone before 9 and it's 8:45.\n\nWhile giving him that last line I pointed to the clock on the wall, which he looked at and could verify it was indeed not 9 PM yet. He just stared back at me, obviously wanting to be angry with me, but also realizing that he was the one who imposed the rule which I was following down to the minute. He just told me to get the groceries and that was that. A few years ago around dinner the topic of rules was somehow brought up, a similar instance in which my parents imposed rules on my brothers, which they then obeyed but the outcome wasn't what my parents desired. I had brought up this story and we all had a good laugh about it.",

        "text": "I'm a bartender. Without getting into too much lurid detail, a man sat at the bar through four beers while constantly trying to strike up unwanted conversation with me as a frantically made cocktails through a Saturday rush. After the fourth beer he starts to really bother me, at which point I ask him if he'd like anything else before he leaves for the night. His response: \"Baileys and cream\" \n\nI know he probably meant Bailey's Irish Cream on ice, which is a fine dessert. But in this case I couldn't resist a chance to serve that fucker a little r/maliciouscompliance, and he got what he asked for: \n\n2 oz of Baileys Irish Cream and 4 oz heavy whipping cream, neat. \n\nHe pounded it and left immediately. \n\nHey asshole, if you're vomiting beer and dairy right now, \n\n\"YOU LOOK GREAT BENT OVER LIKE THAT.\" \n\n\n\nEDIT: UPDATE: Wow, guys. Just to clear this up, the man at the bar was sexually harassing me while I made it clear I was just trying to work, NOT trying to strike up \"normal conversation\". For the folks suggesting I have a \"thin skin\" for not wanting to be told to \"shake it\" and \"bend over\" while trying to bartend, you're either gross or ignorant. I have a feeling you've never been in a similar position. I didn't initially feel the need to explicitly rehash everything that was said to me, since that wasn't the point of the story- I though the quote from him at the end would be enough for most people to get the picture. Thanks to everyone who backed me up on that. \n\nAlso: To clarify, the gross thing about the drink was the 4 oz of thick heavy whipping cream, mixed with a sickly sweet cream liquor, on a stomach full of bubbly hoppy beer. Some folks can handle this, most folks get stomach sick just thinking about it. As a comparison, a good white Russian would use half the amount of cream, be dry shaken to whip up the cream, shaken with ice to chill and dilute, and strained. It would also use kahlua, a coffee liquor, instead of baileys, a cream liquor. This was not a white Russian. This was a monstrosity. ",

        "text": "(Vet Warning: This is a Boot story, so it's probably been repeated and possibly exaggerated upon, but this happened during my very own training, so I'm a first hand witness to it.)\n\nI'm a former Marine, 0621 Combat Radioman, so, after RT (recruit training) on The Island (Parris Island SC), I went to MCT (Marine Combat Training) at Camp Lejeune NC.\n\nFor those who don't know, every Marine not lucky enough to be a grunt goes through MCT to familiarize them with basic infantry skills and weapons operations in case you get a battlefield promotion to infantry (the shit hits the fan and you've got to play grunt because the fighting came to you). So while RT teaches you basic riflery, MCT teaches you how to patrol, set up a firing position, dig a fighting hole, crew a .50 cal, throw a grenade, fire an anti-tank rocket, or use a SAW (Squad Automatic Weapon), etc...\n\nA large part of this is done \"in the field\", sleeping in metal aircraft hangars or spider infested wooden shacks. Because there's training on actual weaponry, there's also an armory, well, essentially a locked shed they keep ammo in. This is guarded ***AT ALL TIMES***, usually by two boot Marines who are taken just for a specific period out of training, and everyone gets a turn.\n\nWhen its your turn, you're given a single round for your weapon (at the time, an M16A2), and given explicit, detailed instructions for who can and cannot access the armory under what circumstances, but they boil down to who is on the list gets in **if** they follow procedure, if they aren't on the list *or* don't follow procedure, they ***don't*** get in. We're told we have authority to fire for effect (kill) to stop unauthorized persons, but, we are to attempt all other non-lethal options before opening fire.\n\nThis is the story of my shift guarding the Armory, and the Legendary Compliance of the other guy, who I'm gonna call Private Literal. Pvt Literal was not the smartest guy, not the toughest, but he was big, fit, and could do exactly as he was told, so he was a good Marine. We were on post for six hours in the middle of the night.\n\nIt's about 2300 hours, and we'd been on post for about two hours, set to be relieved at 0300, when up walks 2nd Lieutenant Shitshow. 2nd Lieutenants are the bottom rung of the Officers ranks in the Corps, signified by a single gold bar as their rank insignia, commonly (derogatorily) called a butter bar. They're known (respectfully) for being egotistical little sons of bitches trying to make name for themselves by bullying the enlisted ranks, at least the boots who don't know yet to ignore them.\n\nAnyway, procedure for us is simple, we get to be stereotypes. So, we get our weapons at the ready (in hand, barrels down, on safe, no round in chamber), and call out \"Halt! Who goes there!?\"\n\n(Yes, really.)\n\nAt that point, anyone with half a brain knows that they are supposed to stop (halt) and identify themselves.\n\nWhat we get is \"Shut the fuck up and get out of my way.\"\n\nSo, per procedure, we raise our weapons, pull the charge handles to chamber our one measely round apiece (weapon still on safe), and state the second part of our scripting.\n\n\"Stop where you are and identify yourself or you will be fired upon!\"\n\nSuddenly, 2nd Lt. Shitshow realizes the predicament he's in, but, his ego can't let him do the right thing, so instead, he says \"I'm 2nd Lt. Shitshow, let me in the Armory now!\"\n\nThat's not the procedure. Procedure is he identify himself, show his ID, one of us holds him at riflepoint while the other checks the list.\n\nAfter stating his demand, he starts walking forward. Pvt. Literal is *not having it.* So, he does what is called a vertical butt stroke (yes you can giggle, we do). This is basically using the buttstock of your rifle (the part that goes against your shoulder) as a battering ram moving upwards at a 45 degree angle into the chin of the person you're trying to hurt. It is severly effective. 2nd Lt. Shitshow weighs maybe 140lbs sopping wet and was maybe 5 foot 9. Pvt. Literal is easily 6 foot 2, 220 lbs of Alabama muscle.\n\n2nd Lt. Shitshow got his first flying lesson that day as the impact pulled his feet six inches off the ground and sent him back probably a good 2 feet before his ass hit the ground.\n\nI got on the radio and called the duty officer, who called and woke his company CO (Capt.), who called the MPs and the (full bird) Colonel (2nd Lt. &lt; Lt. &lt; Capt. &lt; Maj. &lt; Lt. Col. &lt; Col.) over the training regiment. MPs collect 2nd Lt. Shitshow *and* Pvt. Literal and take the 2nd Lt. to Base Medical and Pvt. Literal to holding. I complete the rest of my watch uneventfully with another boot Marine woke up to replace Pvt. Literal.\n\nNext day I'm taken out of the field to go tell my side of the story. My story and Pvt. Literals match up, and are spot on for compliance with all standard procedures.\n\nI can't say what happened to 2nd Lt. Shitshow, but now-PFC (Private First Class) Literal comes back later that day grinning ear to ear and tells me the context of the 2nd Lts little mid-night mission and what's its resulted in for him.\n\nApparantly 2nd Lt. Shitshow was assigned to the Main Armory for Camp Lejeune and was already in hot water for incorrectly reviewing certain procedures there, which, as it turned out, led to our Training Regiment being issued **live** Grenades for the M-203 qualifying range *instead of dummies*. He was going in the middle of the night to swap them out hoping he could cover up his error and nobody be the wiser (there's things here that scream at me as suspect since, but this was PFC Literals story he swore by).\n\nPFC Literal got a meritorious promotion out of it, that part I know, instructor's never would've been OK with him wearing rank he hadn't earned, and they never said a negative word about his new chevrons.",

        "text": "Here's one from about 10 years ago, back in my days in the Air Force.  I was just an observer, but knew all the players and was good friends with the hero of the story, Senior Airman \"Doc.\"  (TL;DR at the end)\n\nFirst, some background.  SrA Doc was a 22 year old kid from Georgia, who was pulling duty as a range safety goon.    On the range, NOBODY outranks the RSO, and a RSO has the authority to do whatever is necessary, including physically 'interacting' with a shooter, to ensure the safety of everyone out there.  Being he was from Georgia, he was very much a \"Yes sir, no sir\" man, and had issues with the concept of positional authority and when officers came out, he'd oftentimes have trouble remembering his position outranked their rank and grade.  After a few weeks of this having trouble exerting his authority, his First Sergeant told him something along the lines of \"I don't give a damn who they are, if someone puts you or others at risk you lay their asses out.\"\n\nNow, on to the MC:\n\nIt's a hot July day and two squadrons are out doing their annual qualifying on the M16A2.  One is a fighter squadron, the other is the engineering squadron I was stationed with.  SrA. Doc was the RSO of the day, and there were several other rangemasters out too.\n\nThe officers of the fighter squadron were up first.  Now mind you, these guys are pilots.  They'll likely never have to actually use a rifle in combat, and god help us if they do because they're like dustbusters: They suck and are worthless at what they're doing.  First group goes up, pow pow pow, done, no issues.  Second group of officers goes up and within moments, one of the rangemasters calls the line cold because a captain had unsafed his weapon before being given the order to do so.  SrA Doc goes up and addresses him.\n\nSrA Doc: \"Sir, you are to follow the orders of the rangemasters and myself at all times.  Do not unsafe your weapon before being told to do so.  Do you understand?\"\nCapt Hotshot: \"Yep, sorry about that, won't happen again.\"\n\nDoc calls the range hot again.  Everyone readies their weapons, and Hotshot *AGAIN* unsafes his weapon before the order is given.  The rangemaster who's supervising this end of the firing line calls the range cold and waves.  SrA Doc goes over.\n\nSrA Doc: \"Sir, if you do that again, you will not be allowed to qualify and I will be forced to file a formal report with your squadron safety officer.\"\nCapt Hotshot: \"Sorry again, I'm just wanting to get this done with.\"\n\nAt this moment, everything seems good, until Hotshot muzzle sweeps Doc and another pilot on the line.  Doc springs into action and stomps Captain Hotshot's hand, at the same time kicks him in the face.\n\nSrA Doc: \"You just aimed a loaded weapon at me and at one of your fucking teammates, SIR!  You're a goddamned safety hazard, SIR!  You're going to kill someone, SIR!  Now get off of my line before I beat your ass, SIR!\"\n\nFarther down the line was the squadron commander, a lieutenant colonel.  He pops up, hands his rifle to the rangemaster who's watching his group, and trots down to see what the hell is going on.  He sees one of his officers, with a bloody face and cradling his right hand with an airman standing over him, screaming.  The lieutenant who got muzzle swept, as well as myself and two other CE officers let the colonel know what had happened.  Colonel gets pissed, orders the captain off the line with a \"I will see you in my office once we're done here.\"\n\nFast forward three weeks, I run into Doc at the chow hall, ask him about what had happened.  Basically, the squadron commander, Doc's squadron commander, Doc's First Sergeant and the captain who got kicked all had a good pow-wow.  First Sergeant was chewed out for giving 'unclear directives to a subordinate,' but nothing more occurred.  Captain Hotshot was downchecked as non-deployable because he had a broken nose which took him off of flight status.  They covered the safety issue.  SrA Doc was awarded the AF Achievement Medal for \"Outstanding Achievement in the performance of his duties as RSO, ensuring the maximum compliance with all range safety rules, etc etc.\"\n\nTL;DR- Junior enlistedman maliciously complies with senior NCO's order by kicking an unsafe officer in the face, is given a medal for it.",

Reason being is because the equipment used analog dials and old school switches.  Everything goes well for the most part, the new owners were all receptive and willing to learn.   Then one day during the two week training session the newly hired pastry chef comes in and I was asked to train him.  This is where the fun begins.\n\r\nMe: So let me show you how to use the oven, it is imported and can be temperamental.\n\r\nPastry Chef: I graduated from Le Cordon Bleu, I don’t need your help.  Have you had formal training in baking?\n\r\nM: No, I have not and I have no doubt you're capable.  However the oven can be temperamental.  I’m just here to give you tips. \n\r\nPC: I don't need your help, I've been trained to bake on many types of ovens.  This is no different, I'll be fine.\n\r\nM: Ok, I understand.  However the owners have asked for a demonstration.  They would like to see a batch of cookies and croissants.  The ingredients are over there.\n\r\nNew Owner: have you taught the new guy how to use the oven?\n\r\nM: I tried to, he said he’s fine and doesn't need my help.\n\r\nNO: Ok, lets see how he does.\n\n\r\nA few hours go by and we come back to two batches of charcoal.\n\r\nNO: what happened to the croissants and cookies?\n\r\nPC: I don’t know, I followed my recipe exactly.

Did you follow the pointers that he gave you?\n\r\nPC: of course I did.\n\r\nM: No, you didn't.  If you hadn't brushed me off so quickly I would have told you that the oven is imported and uses Celsius not Fahrenheit.  Also, the bottom burner runs a few degrees hotter than the top so you need to either use a baking sheet or double pan the pastries to avoid this (pointing to the pieces of charcoal).\r\n\r\nI swear… the absolute arrogance…\r\n\n\nEdit: Initials",

        "text": "Be gentle this is my first time posting/writing on reddit. Tldr at bottom.\n\nWhile in college finishing up my ME degree I worked at an Collision Repair Center (Auto Body). I started as a car washer, after about a month I was in the office mirroring insurance estimates. I was good at it and picked up the software quite well, so I ended up dealing more with customers and eventually became an Advisor. A few months go by and the Used Car Advisor left the company and I took on his responsibilities on top of my own.\n\nSo now I have Sales people to deal with. These Sales people at this company were the greediest and neediest people around. They always wanted theirs done first so that they could make more money but wanted to repair the vehicle as cheaply as possible. This meant they wanted to cut corners like not removing anything from the vehicle unless absolutely necessary. Which made my job very difficult.\n\nSo on with the MC.\n\nIt was a bright Friday and morning and there happened to be a white Lexus from one of the dealerships there to get the front bumper repainted. So I went out to do my estimate at the lower rates since it is basically in house but I still have to pay my techs. This had quite a bit of curb rash and the paint was already flaking away from a previous bad repair. So I emailed their manager the estimate I did. It went something along the lines of:\n\nV: \"Hey the Lexus has a bit of damage to it, we need to remove the bumper, repair and paint it, it will be around $290.\" (Which is about a third of the actual amount it would cost for repair.)\n\nM: \"What! It's just the bumper just paint the thing.\"\n\nV: \"It needs to be repaired you will still see the damage.\"\n\nM: \"Just spray it!\"\n\nThis is where I got tired of them trying to push me around. I have just gotten the go ahead to just paint the bumper so I went out with the email and RO to the shop and told one of my techs that I wanted him just to scuff and paint the bumper. He tried to contest saying about the damage and I told him just do it and that the car will be back next week and he would get paid twice to do. I then went and let me manager know what I was doing and he laughed and said goodluck.\n\nThe car got done late Friday and they came down and grabbed it that Saturday. Now Monday morning I come in and there is a lovely voicemail of the Manager from that dealership screaming his head off about the car. I called him back and said if he wants it done right he will be paying me again. This didn't sit well as there was now an email to my manager and the owner of him trying to berate me into folding. Was not going to happen. My manager backed me up completely and the owner had a good laugh at the email chain. I still hate Sales because of them.\n\ntldr Manager tries to be cheap and just get it painted. Took him seriously and he had to pay me twice to redo it.",

        "text": "One last story about maliciously washing out concrete mixers; I was going to move on to something else, but one of the commenters from last week made me remember this chucklehead.  \n  \nSo, I drive concrete mixers, and for those of you who didn't read my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/92i75g/you_dont_have_a_washout_for_me_no_problem_i/) or the [one before that](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/90mhu1/you_went_after_mama_bear_you_shouldnta_did_that/), concrete washouts and the policies and laws surrounding them are a breeding ground for malicious compliance.  Portland Cement is nasty, evil stuff.  It's about 2/3 Calcium Oxide (also known as quicklime or caustic lime), which has a pH of 12.8.  If it gets on your skin (or in your lungs), it can cause chemical burns.  As such, there are serious regulations surrounding the containment of the water used to wash down any equipment used in concrete work.  The site operator is ultimately responsible for providing the washout container, whether it is a rented metal bin or purpose-built pit (lined with plastic, because the water isn't supposed to touch the dirt).  Fines for failure to comply can be $10,000 per incident per day (or more if federal land is involved).  \n  \nSometimes contractors develop reputations among drivers.  This is rarely good, because drivers don't chat pleasantly about previous jobs; they bitch.  If you end up as the subject of conversation, it's generally because someone is venting about you, or warning other drivers.  That brings us to Scuzz.  Dealing with Scuzz was like getting attacked by a dropbear; you came away from the encounter with nothing but headache, disbelief and, possibly, chlamydia.  On my first encounter with him, he decided to randomly pull out his phone and show me the naked pictures his girlfriend had just texted him and left me with the nagging urge to get the can of Clorox wipes out of my truck and wipe down anything he touched.  When it came time to washout, he told me to go over a couple blocks and use the dirt because it was all ni**ers over there, and nobody would care.  I washed out in a bucket (this was before I learned of the kiddie pool trick) and made sure to pass that helpful information along to the driver bringing the next load, Les.  Les looks like the love child of Grace Jones and King Kong Bundy, and has the unconscious ability to fill all available space in the room; the man can loom while kicked back in a La-Z-Boy.  He is something of a gentle giant, so Derpes Simplex did not get fed through his own pump, but he failed to impress the big man with his antics any more than he had me, and the reputation started to build.  \n  \nSo, it's a couple years later, and Scuzz's company has hit a big score.  They are doing both the grading and concrete for a local resort.  By this point, nobody like working with this company, primarily thanks to Skuzz.  On smaller jobs, the senior drivers beg off and toss the rookies under the bus.  Unfortunately, this new job is going to be too big for that.  But hopefully, we won't have to deal with Skuzz; putting him in charge of a job like this would be like appointing Thomas Midgley Jr. to head the EPA.  \n  \nSo, Scuzz is, of course, chosen as the on-site manager, and there is no way that this will not end in tears.  Trouble starts from day 1 on the concrete pours; there is no washout.  Instead, he digs a hole with a backhoe, has the trucks wash out into the hole, then buries it.  This is incredibly illegal, but for the drivers parts, there aren't too many other options; it's the height of summer, and nobody is going to even attempt to wash out into a bucket (which involves climbing a ladder with a 20-30 pound bucket several times) in 115 degree heat.  We don't have time to do that with the required yardage anyways.  \n  \nThings come to a head halfway into the project.  It's blisteringly hot outside, and Scuzz has vastly overestimated his crew's ability to work in the heat.  Trucks are stacked up on the job for hours before pouring.  The loads should be rejected, and probably would be if the inspector were on site.  Scuzz doesn't want to reject the loads, however, because that's going to reflect very badly on him (each rejected truck will cost the company about $1,000).  So, he instructs drivers to add water to three-hour old concrete; normally you are not supposed to add water after the 90-minute mark, when the concrete has started to set (in that heat the cutoff should probably have been closer to 60) and has the crews pour it.  I had the second-to-last load on the job, so my concrete was four hours old, and I've already added over 100 gallons to try to keep it wet enough to pour.  That is way past the allowable amount (which is usually closer to 10-30 gallons), and most of it was added past time.  The concrete is so far gone that it's hardening as it slides down my chute.  They have to get a couple guys with shovels to keep it moving.  When I finish up, I ask where to wash out, and Skuzz points over to the trench we were using...the trench that is currently being filled in by the backhoe.  So instead, Skuzz tells me to drive down to the low point on the site (a huge pit about 20 feet below grade) and wash out there; he'll have it scraped up with a skip loader later.  \n  \nScuzz is not aware that the reason the backhoe was so furiously filling the trench was because the city inspector had just rolled up on site.  In fact, he's standing on the edge pit looking down at me.  I decide I have had enough of Skuzz.  I look the inspector in the eye, stick my shovel in the chute, and, without breaking eye contact, slowly drag a small pile of concrete down onto the dirt.  As it plops into the dirt like a corrosive cow pat, the inspector jumps into his truck and comes tearing down the ramp like Moses coming down the mountain, and he looks about ready to break a stone tablet over my head.  \n  \nHonestly, I'm not too worried.  While technically I could be in serious trouble, what is on the ground is already dry and can easily be shoveled back into my chute.  Unless the inspector goes on a complete power trip, the worst I am looking at is a dressing down.  The inspector jumps out of his truck and starts swearing at me, asking what the Hell I think I'm doing and threatening me with any number of environmental regulations.  I kick the lump of concrete, and it rolls.  Then, with all the sincere and heartfelt feigned innocence I can muster, I explain that my contractor told me to clean out there, as they did not currently have a washout on site.  The inspector narrows his eyes and asks who my contractor is.  I tell him, and the inspector starts swearing some more.  \n  \nJackpot.  \n  \nAs much as they are the enemy, and to be obstructed, mislead and stymied at every opportunity, inspectors are not stupid.  They know exactly what kind of games Skuzz has been playing on the job site, and they have warned him more than once.  The inspector looks at the muck in my chute and pokes it with a finger.  It's hard and well over 100 degrees (concrete heats up as it sets).  He asks if I have a hammer; I do.  He tells me to knock out as much as possible, and try to use as little water as I can.  He then drives back up the ramp looking to unleash some holy wrath on Skuzz.  \n  \nThe inspector doesn't find Skuzz, who heard the inspector yelling at me, and is currently cowering on the far side of the backhoe.  Instead he finds Jake.  Jake had the last load on the job, and they didn't use all his concrete.  Jake has also been in the industry for 30 years and knows exactly what that concrete will do to his drum.  Jake is standing in front of the very large pile of concrete he spun out onto the ground, and is filling his drum with the water truck's fire hose (with luck, by the time he reaches the plant, all that water will hopefully have loosened up the crap stuck to the inside of his drum).  The inspector doesn't even look at the pile; he just asks, \"Where is he?\" and Jake helpfully points out where Skuzz is hiding.  \n  \nWhen I finally leave, about forty-five minutes later, Skuzz is in the skip loader, trying to break up Jake's giant pile of leftovers.  The inspector has finally run out of breath and stopped yelling, but so long he is there, he decides he might as well check the concrete tickets.  It's not technically his job, but he knows what is and isn't permitted.  As I pass his truck, he is pawing through the tickets...and he's grinning.  There is nothing cheerful or comforting in this grin; a crocodile would think it was a bit predatory.  The last half-dozen concrete tickets all show more than the allowable water.  A few more show that the concrete was poured after the load was expired.  Jake's and mine both helpfully include time stamps showing that water was added after the load expired.  The waves of schadenfreude are almost visibly emanating from the inspector's body.  \n  \nThe inspector not only hit the company with two separate violations (one for each truck), he went for the maximum fine, since there had been prior warnings, and the violations had been willful.  On top of that, he gave the general contractor a heads up about the expired loads and overuse of water.  So, in addition to the EPA fines, Skuzz's boss had to rip out and replace 150 yards of concrete.  We never saw Skuzz again.  \n  \nTL/DR - A problem contractor with a bad reputation grossly mismanages his site and tells me to wash out onto the ground.  I start to do so in full view of an inspector and throw the contractor under the bus.  Contractor gets slapped with $20,000 in fines and $15,000 in repairs.",

        "text": "My husband and I used to live in a tiny little rent house. The only way things worked out was if everything was in its place. The layout of the house was really weird, so that all the rooms opened right off the living room. Our bedroom door was right beside his easy chair in the living room, and we had to go right past it to get to the bathroom or kitchen. Especially at night, everything had to be put away or somebody was going to break a leg trying to get to the bathroom or to the kitchen sink for water. \n\nEvery night he would shove his footstool out into the middle of the pathway between the bedroom/bathroom/kitchen and without saying a word to me, just go to bed, leaving me to straighten up, put the kids to bed, turn off the tv show he’d been watching, and turn out all the lights (not to mention clean up supper and dishes if I hadn’t already done it). The only thing he would do was lock the door, because he’s crazy about locking doors before he goes to bed. \n\nOne night I was making the rounds and straightening everything up and putting the whole house to bed by myself - again - when he decided he wanted me to come to bed right then. He started griping at me for taking to long to come to bed, so I told him I was straightening up all the stuff he left for me to do. He flipped his lid and started *yelling* at me “I don’t need you to clean up after me!” just as I was leaning over to push this heavy-ass footstool out of the way, and I thought “You know what, Buddy? Have it your way.” And I just stood back up and walked away, leaving it sitting right where he put it every damn night. If he didn’t want me cleaning up after him, far be it from me to upset his apple cart!\n\nThe next morning when his 4 am alarm went off, he went stumbling out the bedroom door and right over that stupid footstool. I was asleep and knew nothing about it. I only noticed that he started pushing his footstool out of the way before he went to bed at night. Weeks later he admitted to me he had broken a toe on that footstool that morning. Moral of the story: don’t yell at somebody who’s just doing right by you. ",

        "text": "Years ago I worked as a construction drafter for a mall. Y'know, the biggest one in the US? Most probably don't know, but a family owns it, because they're obsessed with owning malls like the huge one in Canada, etc. Their structure of authority goes: Dad and oldest brother - Absolute authority. Middle brothers - heads of marketing and purchasing. Youngest brother - hot headed dick in leasing (not even the head of leasing!). They all live and work in New York, but use us as well because they do work in our mall and a new one they're currently still building. \n\nSo I get a request from YB to change the floor plan of an existing store that's planning to move, for a proposal of a new store moving in. I dread his emails. He's a huge dick with a Napoleon complex, and nobody likes dealing with him. An interesting detail is that he sketched out it would absorb the Back of House corridor. The problem is that according to the International Building Code (at the time), you are required by law to include a BOH corridor for any tenant over 24,999sf. This would be well over 26,000sf once it took the shape he requested.\n\nWell, he's the \"boss\", so I create the draft and send it to him, but I do mention the IBC statute and offer a second design that would be close to the square footage but keep the BOH, and this was also what my manager and I agreed wild be best.\n\nSide note: In my department, authority went (from low to high this time) Me and laterally my manager, our boss - Project Manager, his boss - Facility Manager, Dad and Oldest Brother - the head honchos from earlier. (The management of these places was a nightmare of a tree)\n\nWell, within minutes of my reply, hot headed YB calls my boss and is apparently irate. Yelling and swearing and saying shit like \"how dare he have the gall to talk back to me!?\"\n\nMy boss called me in after that, and even though we never really hit it off (I don't think he ever liked me, because we were too similar, but my manager only wanted me out of the applicants so he had no choice) he wasn't yelling at me, for once. He tried to keep a cool head and told me \"YB is an asshole and always does this. So you can't do that when he requests something because he freaks the fuck out, regardless if you were right, which you are.\" Ooh, point one for me!\n\n\"When he emails you again, which I know he will, I want you to Cc OB.\"\n\nCan. Do.\n\nOnce OB got his copy, the hammer came down like Thor lost his Natalie Portman.\n\nOB is berating YB in a now COMPANY WIDE email, yelling at him for pulling that higher rank shit on me, and calling him an idiot for not knowing the relevant statute in the IBC, and also for not listening to me for trying to save his ass, and finally for creating an issue that had to make its way to him, the big boy boss.\n\nPoint two to me.\n\nMinutes later, I got a separate email from OB, informing me I was absolutely correct, thanking me for Cc'ing him, and that YB had pissed him off too many times and was now no longer allowed to contact me, only the other drafters in New York.\n\nGame. Set. Match.\n\n\nTL;DR - Family of real owners thinks he's an owner, I politely correct his illegal design and he freaks out. Actual owner provides sweet sweet karma. ",

        "text": "I used to serve in the United States Air Force working in ground transportation. To close the gap I won’t use military acronyms or ranks.\n\nThis Jewel takes place when I worked nights as a dispatcher. My primary job was to support base operations man power and vehicles. Apart of that was renting vehicles to flight crews.\n\nWe had about 30 vehicles we could give air crews to rent. There is an online forum you can fill out or call us directly. This lets you see what we have available. However sometimes we don’t have any vehicles for them to use and they have to just deal with being dropped off and picked up. Basically they can’t travel around the city on the governments dime.\n\nIt’s a normal quiet night liken most. I get a call giving me information on a plane about to land. Ok no problem I dispatch a driver and the proper vehicle to pick them up. Instead of the driver taking them directly to the hotel he comes back to the shop. I’m confused as it’s made clear we have nothing to lend the crew and they have to be taken to the hotel directly.\n\nIn comes this lets call him Jim. Now Jim has a high rank as high as you could consider someone of upper management one rank from being a general. He walks up to me with an angry look demanding that he receive a vehicle for him and his crew.\n\nI asked to see his request form. Jim looks at me as if I have just insulted his honor. “I DON’T NEED PAPER WORK, you will give me what I want or there will be problems. “ I just want to make something clear most people I run into are very very civil. Sometimes though you get Jim. Jim likes to use his position to get what he wants and to threaten others if he doesn’t.\n\n“Ok Jim this isn’t how it works there are procedures and regulations I have to abide by if you don’t have the request then I can’t help you.” He snorts literally snorts his nose puckers up and I thought he was going to shoot snot at me.\n\n“Give me the paper work to fill out then damnit!!” Jim at this point is trying to posture over me as much as he can to make himself appear more threatening.\n\nI hand him the paper work and watch him fill it out. As soon as he hands it back to me without missing a beat I look at him and say. “I’m sorry sir but we have any vehicles at this time to give you. If you don’t mind I can get my guy to take you to your hotel and we will pick you up tomorrow morning.” Honestly my smile at this point was clearly one of satisfaction and I was holding back laughter. Took this guy 10 minutes to fill the paper work out.\n\nAt this point he is furious he starts yelling and screaming at me at the top of his lungs. All the guys get out of there seats to come into the dispatch area but I wave them back into the lounge. I let him yell for a solid 15 minutes. I honestly was impressed\n\nAfter he calms down a bit he leans over the counter might be about 6 inches between us and he says” Your mouth just wrote a check your rank can’t cash.”\n\nSilence just fills the room. After a few moments I say “Did you just reference top gun?” He takes a step back and I’m not sure what was going through his head but I think he had a lot of miss fires at the moment.\n\nHe begins to start up again telling me that I’m just an airmen and I have to respect the chain of command and that if he gives me an order I have to obey. I’m not going to muck up the story with explanation about chain of commands. At this point I had enough.\n\nI stood up”Sir I understand your frustration but I run this shop, I am the dispatcher and what I say goes. I have told you we can’t give you a vehicle and stated the alternatives. If you continue to cause me problems I will call the police who will be happy to escort you from this building, and tomorrow you can explain to the boss why you felt the need to scream and shout for the sake of a vehicle. This is what’s going to happen you are going to get onto that bus and one of my guys will take you and what is very obviously a tired crew to the hotel. What is it going to be?”\n\nHe was stunned and his posture changed instantly. He looks back at the crew who at this point have turned their heads away as if pretending not to hear.\n\nI sit back down in front of the computer slide the paper work and information he gave me. I look down at my rank and back at him and said”Check cashed.”\n\nGist: Man names Jim tries to abuse his power while referring too top gun. Only to be shut down in the same way.\n\nEdit: spelling\n\nSome are asking if I got into trouble. I didn’t my commander found the story hilarious and left it at that.",

        "text": "One of my coworkers many years ago, a fellow I'll call George, was tasked with upgrading some servers located on the west coast of the US. As part of the process he needed someone at that location to physically power-cycle them.\n\nThe first few days went okay, outside of his boss barking at him over email to do only the server upgrades every time he was seen out of his seat doing other work. Between yum and apt and 'Can you reboot AS-1-07-A please?' he read a book and looked busy.\n\nWell, until the Monday when the west coast guy went on vacation. His first call of the day went to straight to voicemail, telling him to contact someone else instead. \n\nGeorge did, only to hear the woman wasn't at her desk. Eventually he dialed main reception at that office to see what was going on. \n\n\"Oh, she works graveyard and won't be in until 7pm. Try back after then.\"\n\nMore waiting, more servers. Around 10pm eastern he got his call back.. \"Sorry! Both our daysiders are on vacation for the next two weeks, so that only leaves me. I've gotten your list rebooted, you're good to go.\"\n\nBefore walking out the door George emailed his boss, telling him about the scheduling snafu and asking if he could come in late.\n\n\"No\" was the response. \"You're not special and you need to be in at 8am, just like everyone else.\"\n\nGeorge emailed back. \"What if I come in at seven and do the reboots then? Thanks to the time-zone difference I can still catch the graveyard person and have sufficient warning if there's a problem.\"\n\nOnce again it was a hard \"No\". He was not to postpone reboots, he was not to reboot them himself, and he was not to alter his starting time. The email went on to criticize his work ethic, telling him that if he was worried about the small amount of extra work involved maybe he should find a different job.\n\nOkay.. George was pretty sure his boss had just glossed over every PST or EST in his emails as well as the references to time zones, but hey! Following orders meant at least five hours a day in authorized overtime to sit and read a book, so SCORE. \n\nAnd then Friday came. George knew that his west coast contact didn't work Friday and that no one would be in the office at all to do a reboot. So he got started on a different project, letting the boss know he was blocked until Monday and requesting some details on the other project. \n\n\"Why are you asking about &lt;other project&gt;? The server upgrades are top priority, so stop trying to bull shit me with this blocking nonsense and fucking get them done, you jackass! I don't want to hear about this again.\"\n\nThe email closed with a thinly veiled threat to fire George for any back-talk and a dickish reminder that insubordination wouldn't earn him unemployment. \n\nSo George followed orders. Along with reading his book he spent a few minutes to fill out a backdated transfer application to my department. Maybe his boss will be happy to let him go after what he's about to pull. \n\nWhen 10:30pm rolled around he looked up the org chart. The boss didn't want to hear about it, but he had a problem and had to speak to someone. After a few unanswered calls as he went more or less straight up George finally spoke to a confused vice president who asked for the relevant emails and told him to go home. \n\nThe next morning George had a shiny new email, sent by his boss around 1am and conspicuously CC'd to the vice president, apologizing for his 'total failure to comprehend the time-zones and schedules of those involved' and the 'completely inappropriate tone and language' in earlier emails. \n\nIt was followed by another, from the VP, assuring George that he had done nothing wrong and that any concerns, of any kind, should be reported to him as soon as possible.\n\nHe replied to the VP:\n\n\"Well, sir. I applied for the open position in &lt;other department&gt; several days ago, and I'm afraid that, given this incident and his past behavior, Boss will block my transfer. This just might be what makes him 'lose it' or discipline me in a way that makes me ineligible.\"\n\nGuess who got the desk next to mine two days later, without so much as an interview? George. I wasn't even told I had a new guy until he was unboxing his desk and introducing himself. ",

        "text": "Ok, think I checked off all the acronyms, so here it goes!\n\n**Backstory:** My grandfather was born (1920) and raised in Germany. As was the custom at the time, he was required to volunteer for the army. The first time he got his draft letter, his boss at the construction company took care of it, as they had government contracts and thus got exempt from military drafts. Unfortunately, that meant he could almost abuse his workers as slaves, as long as it was still a better option than getting sent to invade France. So grandpa wiggled out of his job with the second letter 6 months later and became part of the 'second line', basicly he came in after the fighting and fixed what the other guys shot/bombed to hell, mostly comms &amp; logistics stuff. Queue one playful guy who knows his job.\n\nMore info [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/9472dd/my_granddad_prankster_and_military_compliance/e3s6hgs)\n\n**The players:**\n\n+ GD: GrandDad, or Great Dude, a good old fashioned prankster getting drafted.\n+ PB: Patrol Buddy, his unknowing partner in crime.\n+ DC: Dickhead Captain. About the lowest of officers that actually volunteered. Hates GD for unknown reason.\n+ Chief: Runs the local division, likes his easy military management deskjob.\n\n*All titles converted to current-ish ranks*\n\nDuring his time in the military, GD's group toured France, the Alps, over Austria back home. At some point, he was stationed as patrol guard in a villa/control in southern France post they 'borrowed' from a wealthy local.\n\nIt was not uncommon for officers to sneak out a small back gate of these villa grounds to go to the local village and have some drinks (and/or women). It was officialy not allowed and even punishable to leave their post for leisure, but officers weren't prone to complain and the few regular soldiers that knew didn't want to get an ass-whooping from a vengeful officer. Queue the MC...\n\n**The story:**\n\nAbout an hour before GD is scheduled for guard duty, he sees DC leave for the village, and starts to formulate a plan. After making a few rounds, he convinces PB to hide behind a hedge near the gate and await the return of DC. They wait there for a long time, up to the point where PB starts asking GD to drop it and go back on patrol before they are caught. Luckily GD is his senior in age (not sure if rank) and PB doesn't have the guts to walk away. About 20 min before the end of their shift, GD hears the back gate open and goes for it...\n\nAs the gate swings open and a half-drunk DC walks through, GD jumps out in the open, quickly shouts \"Who goes there?\", \"Who goes there?\" and fires a round in the air before keeping his weapon aimed at a stunned DC. PB, realizing shit is about to go down, follows protocol and coordinates the other soldiers running to the sound and 'frisks' the DC for his papers and weapons before bringing him to Chief under armed escort, as per regulation.\n\nThey arrive at the Chief's office and GD &amp; DC are requested in to explain. GD gets to go first and explain to the Chief;    \n*\"While I was on patrol duty, I heard someone coming on the grounds through a small gate in the back. As per protocol, I made myself visible, shouted twice \"Who goes there\" and as I had not yet received an answer, fired a warning shot to apprehend the intruder.\"*    \nChief realises GD followed protocol to the letter, and punishing would require an official explanation as to what DC was doing at the back gate. He sends GD back on patrol and to take PB and the guard with him from his hallway. The door is barely closed when they hear Chief shouting at DC; *\"You moron, now they[soldiers] all know about our way to the village. Do you know how much you screwed us[officers] over!\"* DC has sobered enough to take the earful and not make a fuss, as the alternative was a court martial for desertion.\n\nGD walks away with a smile and a few promised beers from fellow soldiers. DC becomes unwelcome in any card games among officers for the rest of their stay.\n\nTL;DR: Officer sneaks out of base to visit nearby village. my granddad, on patrol, 'arrests' him as he didn't identify himself when called out. Protocol did not say how long to wait for an answer though.\n",

They (keeping clean as possible) were bought a new chair for the office after they broke the last one. And it sat in its box for weeks until a therapist put it together on the request of our regional manager. \n\nSo I was questioned about things I brought in to help the store. One was desk for the backroom computer and another a table for the breakroom. I was told we would get all the things needed and to take all the things I bought home. \"All of them?\", I asked. And was told a very strong \"Yes!\". So tonight I took home everything, including the mice I bought for the front desk computers. The front desk, for months, were hitting the mice against the check-in counter to make them work. Destroyed the serenity of the spa. So I bought some new ones to help with the process as I want my clients relaxed until their car and the return to the real world. I took everything home. I am off tomorrow so I'm curious how the front desk will do without mice on the computers. Should be interesting. I expect some chaos. But, day off. So I'll enjoy reading the chaos on our group chat as I enjoy my scotch and my cigars. \n\nUPDATE: So according the the lead therapist neither management nor front desk even realized I took home the mice last night. They go to open this morning and \"Uh-oh\". One of the problems is that we open at 8, and the only place they thought to solve their problem (Best Buy) opens at 9. So for a little over two hours (getting there at 7 to make sure things are good till shortly after 9 with new mice) the entire front desk was down to a single computer using the mouse from the manager's office, meaning the manager was down to doing nothing. Not really a change though, in my opinion. Apparently the manager first wanted to use the mouse from the breakroom computer, but that is how we check our client's massage history and what not. So during the \"I need my morning pampering\" rush it was hell. \"We're so sorry. Our computers are down and our IT department (usually me because I'm apparently the only computer nerd there) is on it. But you can get a complimentary massage enhancement if you would like for the inconvenience\". Manager was talked down by lead therapist saying I followed everything that I was told to do. And that is shows how much I do for the store. So no official actions will be taken against me but I'm sure I'll be getting the stink-eye. Especially if management has to answer up as to why we gave out a couple dozen free enhancements. \n\nUnexpected Collateral Damage: I took home the coffee machine too. Apparently that thing is a must have for the morning therapists. Was asked by the lead therapist to bring that back. \n\nAlso, thank you all for taking and interest in the ending to this story.",

        "text": "Small thing that happened to me this morning at my retail job, also forgive me I am on mobile in my break room writing this.\n\nTl;dr at bottom\n\nThis guy (G) walks up to me at the returns desk asking to have a refund on a sprinkler system that ended up not having the correct connection to work with his house... or something like that.\n\nAnyways, the conversation goes more or less like this.\n\nMe: do you have the receipt?\n\nG: no\n\nMe: do you have the card you payed on so we could look up the receipt?\n\nG: no I paid cash\n\nMe: well without the receipt or paying on the card I could give you in-store credit would that be acceptable? (at this point I scan in the item assuming he will say yes, as people normally do)\n\nG, looking at the price that would be refunded to store credit: “does it refund the full price of the product?”\n\nMe, pointing on the screen: “it will refund the amount shown on the screen, if it’s not the full price then I won’t be able to refund the full price unless you had your receipt, which shows how much you paid”\n\nG:”well I don’t want to get refunded less than I paid, and I want cash, hold on”\nHe then proceeds to open his wallet, which is full of receipts, and expertly grab the exact receipt with the sprinkler system on it, then hand it to me without even glancing to see if it’s the correct receipt.\n\nWhen I scan in the item now using the receipt I notice that he got a $30 markdown on the item, and the amount he is receiving in cash is actually much LESS than what he would have received with the store credit.\nHe hasn’t looked at the screen or noticed yet so I quickly finish the transaction, and hand him the cash in $10 bills instead of the $20 bills underneath the register (which he puts in his wallet without counting) and start helping the next customer.\n\nEdit: holy crap I didn’t expect this to blow up like it did... to all you guys saying I was rude to a possibly innocent customer I say you are right, he was possibly innocent, but I didn’t give him any less money than he deserved/payed originally. Besides, sometimes people have other reasons to get cash rather than store credit.\n\nTl;dr: customer didn’t want store credit for his return because it wouldn’t refund the whole amount, and ends up getting less than the store credit would have gotten him\n\nEdit:spelling the word payed",
