        "text": "I'm a 3rd year undergraduate majoring in ECE in a pretty good university in India. My interests are computer architecture and digital design. My grades are not great because of the first two semesters being online and me having no interest to study during that time. But, since my third semester I have grabbed on to computer architecture, especially RISC-V and have indulged pretty well. I have had three internship experiences so far, two research and one industry. My first research experience was in a university lab and it was about RISC-V on FPGA and I thoroughly enjoyed this. Next one was last summer, I worked for a semiconductor company as a CPU Verification intern and really enjoyed working with open source tools to verify a RISC-V CPU. Currently, working as a research intern at a software startup in the field of DNN accelerators on FPGA. \n\nNow, my concern is that; should I continue my integrated master's or get a job in either of the two companies I have worked at? My end goal is to get into research and get a PhD. Next semester, I will be rejoining the research lab at my university and will be again working on a well funded RISC-V project.\nI'm concerned my gpa would hinder my opportunities when applying to grad school abroad. Any advice as to what I should be doing and what I should choose would be appreciated:)\n\ntl;dr decent internship experience, not so great gpa. End goal PhD, so master's or a job before applying to that",

(studying for decent grades, preparing for Appling abroad, work-currently working as a translator, applying and getting an internship somewhere)\n\nSorry if was long.

To make it short, consider this image-\n\n[The register address + format for the I2C seconds-minutes-hours](https://preview.redd.it/9r9rne7gep4a1.png?width=732&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30ddcd992fe3e3c533111484674dcd18ec3c2595)\n\nIf you examine the \"Seconds\" bit- it shows 7 bits as needed to register 00 to 59. \n\n59 in binary is  0b111011, yet the datasheet shows 00-59 as requiring 7 bits to be defined... similarly for minutes, and for hours (if you go for 24-hour format) it implies 6 bits are needed to represent 00 to 23... 23 is 0b10111...  ðŸ˜…\n\nNow I passed this off as something to ignore and set the time normally (I just passed uint8\\_t's in as usual- I'm using a Pi Pico btw) and the RTC is precise to the second in iterating forward. \n\nHowever, when I then go to check the time, I notice this too...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img bugkpwsdfp4a1...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 7xq80c7ifp4a1...*\n\nThis is my second RTC that I've tested so it's clearly something on the software end that I'm tossing up. Am I misunderstanding how binary works...? How can it expect 7 bits to represent 59 when 59 itself is only 6 bits... I'm just confused at this point.\n\nI'm doing this on a Pi Pico so if anyone is familiar with that and wants a code example, I can provide a GitHub link (I'll need to upload it/etc first) though this seems like a pure misunderstanding of a datasheet...",

Poor study habits, poor mental, poor everything, and I just got out of my final certain I've failed the class, I mean I left 2 problems over Thevins and Nortons completely blank. However, I don't want to give up, I've improved as a person and I think will my increased focus and good habits that I'll do well next time.\n\nThe only problem I'm having is that I don't feel like I have the tools for success. I have the book *Charles K. Alexander's Fundamentals of Electric Circuits*, which I like because of how it breaks down the material. However, I feel the problems I'm expected to do in class and on tests are significantly harder. \n\n[Here's the hardest NVM problem from my textbook.](https://imgur.com/a/8PLMKiw)\n\n[Here's what an NVM problem looks like on my exams.](https://imgur.com/a/mVWrfIr) \n\n[And my textbook doesn't seem to cover any problems like this, but I can always expect something like this on the exams.](https://imgur.com/a/2IkgMGF) \n\nAre there textbooks out there that will prep me for problems of this difficulty and complexity? Or am I supposed to internalize the core concepts and extrapolate them to solve the harder problems?",

        "text": " Hi folks :)\n\nI run a small business in the UK and we use a LOT of commercial lighting equipment. Whilst we make small pcb projects in house for demos, or even for props for film/tv. We would never sell them into a fixed installation. i.e. something that is running for longer than a weekend or something that is a permanent fixture.\n\nWe were discussing this in the office this morning mainly from a legality point of view.\n\nFor me, off the shelf hardware (even when it has custom programming) comes with a warranty and the relevant/necessary certifications and accreditations. Such as CE, ROhs, TuV, UL, EMC (and the list goes on).\n\nWhere do you stand with custom electronics in that regards\n\nExample:\n\nWe use some lighting hardware that is Â£800. But some projects that come in, we can do on a Â£20 microprocessor that we have to house in box/breadboard and do some work on.\n\nThe Â£800 unit, has a 3 year warranty and all of the necessary certs. My microprocessor doesn't OR if it does have its CE markings, how far do these cover? If i then use the microprocessor with some other electronics, is that classed as a separate product? Should this then be independently certified?\n\nAny and all input is welcome. Just curious to know what we can/can't and should or shouldn't do.\n\nCheers and happy tinkering :)",

I would be fine going directly to industry if family/life gets in the way. The other consideration is I've already accepted the internship opportunity from Raytheon, so to go with one the other two I would have to renege on Raytheon. I have no desire to work for Raytheon (or any defense contractor) in the future so being blacklisted wouldn't be that bad. Texas Instruments is near the top of the list for companies I would want to work for if I don't go to graduate school, but the international research is such a unique opportunity. I prefer analog research over PTV intern over component selection.\n\nI'm leaning towards the research position, but I want to see if any of you think it would be a bad idea to turn down Texas Instruments or to renege on the Raytheon offer since I'm not set on grad school.",

        "text": "Hi,\n\nI had thought that PCI Express (PCIe) is used to connect different peripheral devices to the computer or processor, in simple terms. I was looking at the diagram shown below and it shows that PCIe is used to connect many other buses (e.g. SATA, USB) to the processor as well. In other words, PCIe is used to connect peripheral devices and also other buses to the processor and acts more like an internal bus which connects different parts of the system with the processor. Could you please comment on it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Figure 1: https:\\/\\/www.quora.com\\/How-is-a-chipset-related-to-PCI-E-ports-and-connectors](https://preview.redd.it/ytru9ymqtm3a1.png?width=1015&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b3db090857cb31b166d62373ef4659ccd3034b7)",

However, I'll not be able to go without a fully-funded scholarship. My preferred country would be Canada but I heard it is extremely competetive and I'd unlikely get any funding. Any tips on how I should progress? Shortlisting universities seems like a very daunting task, I just cannot understand how people shortlist them",

I noticed that it used 2Vm/(pi)Rl to get the Idc, but isn't this wrong because it's a Half wave not a Full wave? also, how am i going to solve if it's center tapped? do i just multiply Vm to 2?",
