Even my advisor has told me that I would be a good phd student and I am an independent thinker. He seems to only say that after he criticizes other people. \n\nHowever, 4/6 other students in my lab are telling me not to do a phd with him. 2 of them will graduate with their masters this semester, and the other 2 will graduate next year. I'm not sure if they're just really jaded or honestly looking out for me. \n\nI have seen the advisor reprimand my lab mates in meetings and send out harsh emails as well. It is quite brutual, and my self-esteem would tank if it happened to me. It hasn't happened to me yet, but it might be because I'm new. \n\nI'm trying not to let the other lab mates get in my head, but it's hard to do when they keep reminding me every week or so.

Then over time as I worked on my projects (that do not overlap AT ALL with the other students projects) Brad began to make passive aggressive comments like ‚ÄúCara is an over achiever and makes me look bad to everyone‚Äù or will make comments that he compares himself to me and uses me as motivation to go into lab so he can ‚Äúcompete‚Äù. I told him that‚Äôs not rly a healthy place to put me in and that those comments make me feel sh*tty. Brad apologized and said it wouldn‚Äôt happen again. Fast forward three weeks, these comments are still happening and I now found out that this fall Brad went to other labs in our department and ‚Äúwarned‚Äù them about me and how I‚Äôm essentially an awful human and to basically watch out for me. I was told this by those grad students who apologized to me for being distant/cold to me and not giving me a chance this fall because they were scared of me due to what Brad told them. I have a meeting with my advisor about it tomorrow to ask how I can work in lab and avoid further issues and professionally deal with this.

Also, everyone does a software engineering internship in the summer between first and second year. Internship salary ranges a lot but I think typical ranges are 30$/hr to 9k a month+housting stipend at Amazon (a lot of masters students from this program get an Amazon intern offer). I also will try to do another internship fall of the second year while taking the easiest 2 masters level classes I can. I can't say how much all of this will help reduce my total debt from 75k, but I'm hoping this will reduce it by 10-20k.\n\nTotal compensation for a full-time offer after completing the program is between 130k-200k depending on the level of company I get an offer at. Getting an offer at a Capital one type of company should be fairly easy and will pay about 130 first year, but getting an offer at Amazon will be harder and thus will pay 180k first year. \n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts on whether this is reasonable?",

The experiences shared were that incoming freshman in a college for science majors chemistry class were struggling with math to the point that they didn't \"get fractions\" and could not \"solve for x\".  A pre-requisite for that class is college algebra.  I have no doubt that some of this is an unfortunate side effect from Covid impacts on their high school education. My unpopular opinion is that you are not doing a student that deficient in math any favors by keeping them in that class. They are not learning chemistry, they are learning how to make their numbers match a number in the book. At best they learn some math, at worst they fail out of the class, program or school. \n\nThe presenter in the discussion mentioned the phrase in the title at some point.  I agree to an extent but when the deficiencies are far below expected level for the class at hand I think education shifts to doing a disservice for the students both at the expected level and below. Lots of good discussion followed  on how do you assess, what is the goal for those classes etc.  Curious to see what others think on that type of philosophy.  At what point do you need to hold standards and tell people they need remedial help?",

        "text": "I‚Äôm in my second year of my psychology masters at American University and it has been a shit show from the start. When I got there and spoke with the program director I made it clear I planned to go on to a clinical PhD. She told me not to join a lab in my first semester because it would be too much and I needed to adjust (keep in mind I had just come from undergrad where I double majored, double minored and graduated with honors while working 30 hours a week). I also showed her my plan for each class to take each semester and she approved it. Then when we met (month and a half into first semester) to register for the following semester she freaked out that I hadn‚Äôt joined a lab yet and told me I was behind. She then recommended I work with an adjunct faculty on my thesis rather than a core faculty member. \n\nSo spring semester I started working with that professor, who had never mentored anyone, and I month in she ghosted me. I then went to the program director and told her what was happening and I wanted to bring in a new mentor. At this point I had pretty much everything ready to go for my study and just needed help with the final touches and someone to sign off to start it. I brought her two faculty members I was considering and she told me to reach out to Dr. X as they were less busy and would help me more. I also met with program director about classes where she proceeded to tell me that the classes I wanted to take were only offered every other year and I missed my chance and would have to replan my remaining semesters. Yay. I contacted Dr. X and they said they would be happy to help. They then proceeded to ask me to send everything I had, which I did at the beginning of the semester and did not give me any feedback until OCTOBER!  \n\nIn October Dr. X gave me their feedback, which was pretty limited, and then told me they didn‚Äôt have time to mentor me so we would be bringing Dr. A on to help me. I again had to send all my work to them and get another professor up to speed. My program also has is take two classes instead of three our final semester which drops us down to part time. I confirmed with the financial aid office this would not affect my federal aid and they said it wouldn‚Äôt so cool. \n\nFlash forward to this semester. I‚Äôve still made practically no progress on my thesis because my mentors keep asking me to work on stuff that is already done and I‚Äôve sent the multiple times. I also just contacted financial aid because I realized my tuition hadn‚Äôt been paid yet. They said because I was part time they had CANCELED my federal aid WITHOUT TELLING ME and had just reinstated it and I would have to reapply for one of my loan. And I can almost guarantee they only did that when I emailed because when I checked this morning it had not been reinstated. And these are just the biggest issues I‚Äôve had here. There are a million smaller things that have happened in my time here. I cannot wait to leave this program and I cannot emphasize how much I recommend AVOIDING it.",

Of course, if I'm assigned something to do, I'd still do it and try to make it as high quality as possible. Unfortunately, I don't feel like doing anything, though, if I'm not assigned anything, and I no longer have the motivation to come up with ideas/experiments on my own.\nI was scheduled to take time off during December, but southwest did their thing, and I ended up not being able to leave. I am now rescheduled until the end of this month (couldn't make it earlier as I had some meetings and seminars, and the prices were pretty expensive too), but idk if I can be useful until then. I feel guilty just sitting on my ass and doing nothing or coming in late and barely doing a single thing. I feel even more guilty given that my PI is very nice and supportive and that I'm progressing very well and have met all the milestones thus far. I started feeling down after having switched from a previous toxic lab to this one, but never this bad. The only unfortunate thing about my current lab is that money is tight, and I'm really limited in what I can do. Every time I suggest anything (with very very few exceptions) it gets put on the side because we don't have the money for it, even if my PI likes the idea, so I stopped coming up with new ideas.\nIdk what to do until the end of the month. I can't continue to be this useless until my break. It is boring and depressing and unfair to my supportive boss. The only thing I've been wanting to do lately is to eat, exercise, stay up late, and sleep in late...\nWhat to do for now?",

I worked on two research projects and have two papers that'll hopefully be published some time this year. \n\nNow that sounds all good, but my grades are kinda on the lower end(definitely quite below average by the standards of my institute). I tried a couple websites to find out what they'd be on a 4.0 scale, and it looks like they'll probably be around 3.1/3.2ish. Not sure how reliable those conversions are though. \n\nAnyway, I'll be finishing my Master's in a few months but I chose not to apply for a PhD this year because I figured my chances are pretty low until at least one of the papers get published. I'm also pretty burnt out from a bunch of stuff that happened during the lockdown. I honestly have pretty terrible imposter syndrome and my confidence in my own abilities/understanding of physics is just terrible as of now. Given all that, I figured I shouldn't be applying right now. Oh, and I also found out that I have ADHD (no one noticed it when I was a child because I did well academically. Lockdown aggravated the effect of my symptoms on academia.) which I need to learn to manage as well. \n\nHowever, I do want to do a PhD at some point. Hopefully, that'll be next year. I wanted to get an opinion about my chances from you fine folks. Also wanted to know if I should try to improve my chances by doing internships or something, over the next year to increase my research experience. Ideally, I'd like to take a break from academia(not necessarily a whole year) to get over the burnout, though. I'm confused whether that'll negatively impact my chances.\n\nPlease give me your honest opinion and any advice you may have! Feel free to be as critical as possible. Thanks!",

        "text": "This is something like a vent post. I enrolled on a second Master's program in September because I was unsuccessful applying for PhD programs with my first one. My previous education was very theoretical and not extremely related to my desired field, with very little lab contact. So I was hoping I could fix that with a second MSc, and since I don't have a lot of funds available after living two years abroad, I decided to do it back in my home country (in southern Europe). What a mistake it was.\n\nThe first year is also extremely theoretical, and the classes usually are of low quality (usually dumping information with lots of repeating topics since faculty seems to be unaware of the overall syllabus). Despite the initial disappointment, I have been crushing the exams (the ones for which the grades are known, I'll get to that in a bit) like I intended and delivering all the assignments on time. I even did very well in an \"optional\" free class that is not related to my background and is outside of my comfort zone. However, the program is so hellishly disorganized that it's killing my motivation, and I'm not sure I can continue studying here. \n\nThere is a \"modules\" arrangement, and they are usually small, which means in practice that 100% attendance is required and we are constantly being evaluated. Despite that, they are happy to change the schedule at a whim with very little advance. Several \"modules\" don't have set exam dates, and in those cases the tests are scheduled with a few DAYS advance, with no flexibility granted for students who can't make those surprise dates. Extremely short modules (think 4 classes) will often come with very heavy written assignments that are inadequate for the number of credits awarded. However, the rigidness only applies to students, since more than half of the evaluations/assignments handed since October haven't even been graded yet. And I have had problems with almost every single grade I received (for example, it's not logged on the digital grading platform or it gets switched for another student's - yes, that happened too). The cherry on top is a completely useless administrative team coupled with cumbersome and endless bureaucratic requirements. It's impossible to solve any issue at all and there is zero support in case you need something done. Emails are ignored, deadlines aren't respected, printed papers disappear in the void, and there is no accountability from the University's part for their own mistakes. \n\nThis situation has caused me immense stress, and it feels like every task takes 100x more effort than it should. I have recently started working with a decent pay and I am considering dropping out and forgetting any academic aspirations. The final straw now was a test being scheduled today on a date on which I had a previous arrangement for a long time (it's next week). I did everything I could to avoid this, even emailed several weeks ago, but there was zero flexibility. I also lost around 500‚Ç¨ this month for not working on days that could possibly fall on the test lottery. \n\nIt angers me that I've already wasted so much money, time and effort on this but it's not worth my mental health. I can only urge you to talk to previous students before you enroll in any program.",

My question is if I will struggle to get accepted into a environmental science masters program with such a mixed bag bachelor‚Äôs degree. I am missing some courses that are probably important like physics and computer science, will universities consider me at all or even allow me to make these up through a bridging program? Or will they likely just outright deny my application. I have some research on my resume but it is more social science research. How can I bridge the gaps so that I can go into a more scientific field? Im sure all factors will be considered but how likely am I to be accepted?\n\nThanks :)",

I have been doing a theological/philosophy degree now for about a term and at first I thought this was going to be a great program for me, but due to a mix of toxicity on the leadership and student level. I don't think I can continue in the program for the sake of my well being. I can finish out the term as we are nearly a month in, but I am tired of always arguing with my relatively small cohort and I dread the meetings with the leadership of my program because we have such different views. They think the reality should be way different than what I know it is.\n\nAnyhow, I also need to move on because as someone who holds very mainline views and generally is in the majority of people in the field. We have so many needless arguments and conversations about things that can't change. We have a new member of our program who always is looking for an argument and the other person who started in the program with me and I do not get along in the slightest. Which has put a huge strain on me because I also feel like they're trying to bully me out of the group/attack me on my values and beliefs because I am not much of a liberal theologian. Today we had an argument over the work of one of the great Middle Ages philosophers and one of them suggested his work is not brilliant at all and the average BA could write his level of work. Which is preposterous to me as a suggestion because I don't think the average 21-year-old could write to the degree of Aquinas (who we were arguing over).\n\nAnyhow, I just don't want to have to argue with my cohort every day or have to tread ice around them to avoid an argument. It's so exhausting to me that I can't do it anymore. I know I get a look of fear in my eyes when I see them because I don't know how the interaction will go with them and that isn't a good thing to experience.\n\nThanks for your thoughts on the matter. I went to talk to my old mentor in undergrad this evening and she said they'd love to have me back at my undergrad for master's studies, and I am HIGHLY considering it. Not to mention some of my best friends from back home are also soon probably going to do studies there. Which would be awesome!",

In general, I get things done as they come up, but I'm approaching some big projects and want to make sure I'm proactive, rather than reactive to whatever deadline is imminently looming.

(Will also graduate from M.S. program this spring)\n2. Will include my thesis defense in next application.\n3. A research paper is going to be submitted soon and will be reviewed.\n4.

        "text": "Hi folks. I'll be studying a Master's in CS soon and wanting to buy a new laptop. What do CS grad students use nowadays?\n\nMy work laptop is a Macbook Pro and I do a lot of coding with it and it's great. I'm just concerned if I buy one for personal use, post sales experience of an Apple product would be expensive. \n\nThat being said, what I have in mind is to get a Dell XPS or Lenovo X1 Carbon and dual boot Ubuntu w/ Windows, that way I can switch between technical work and writing papers/thesis. \n\nCare to share some experience? Thanks.",

I have a little under 50K in Savings (Lived at home while working remotely), and I want to go back to get my Master's in Business Analytics and just got into a program.\n\nThe program costs about 15K and I have the money to pay for it, but I got my fin aid package for an unsubsidized loan for the amount of the program + some..Would anyone have any thought's on if it might just be better to just pay it all off as I go, or take the loan and keep my liquid capital and just pay for years to come.. (it's a year master's program).\n\nLet me know if anyone has any thoughts or suggestions.\n\nThank's all!",

Mostly because I want to learn, partly career, and partly the area.\n\nTheir TA program seems crazy to me. The stipend is $5500 per academic year, and you have to apply for the job each semester with a lesson plan and interest letter. This is to teach freshman comp and grade essays. I feel like I'm better off getting a part-time job somewhere else, or just doing the degree part-time. Am I right in thinking so? I don't have much student debt at all.",

I‚Äôm currently taking some sociology classes at my local community college while I research grad schools. I‚Äôm in California, and I‚Äôm 30F.\n\nI have an undergrad in Art. I want to volunteer to draw with kids that have cancer in hospitals. Working on my portfolio still and researching places that allow this. I‚Äôm also volunteering for a crisis text hotline.\n\nI hope to continue my volunteer work, create children‚Äôs books, and teach. I also hope to maybe dive into planning/development for charities or schools with this degree. But ultimately I really want to get into higher education. I just want to hear about your experiences, how you got there, what made you decide, and if this is realistic. I really appreciate the feedback!",
