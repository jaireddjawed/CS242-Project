College is in, so low to no tip Dorm deliveries are in session.\nTwo deliveries, one phone number, separate payments.\nOne is credit, the other is cash. \nCredit bro signs his paper and lines through the tip part. No problem I'm accustomed to this here.\nCash bro says \"Should be more than 34 (cents)\" and I slip away ever so grateful for the few pennies or whatever above the 34 I've gotten to keep for my services.\nThen as I get further away, I realize, no, he actually shorted me four cents.\nSo I take a breath, and I text the number. \"You shorted me four cents. So not only do I get to deliver your food in my car, my gas, (for no tip) but I get to help pay for your food too! Not cool.\"\n\nThe number rang me back, but I didn't notice, so didn't answer. \n\nFour cents is trivial, but I'm not paying you for the privilege of delivering your dinner, bro. \n\nEdit: Forgot to include the part where I called them out for not tipping, as well as shorting me.",

        "text": "So, we all have those things that piss us off as drivers, are ridiculous, etc.  I've wanted to compile a small list of these for others to view and comment for fun.  And of course, to add their own!  If you've been a driver you've dealt with most of these in some form or another.  \n\nI do like my job, but these are some things I don't get to gripe about anywhere else.  Here we go!!\n\n1. Hidden house/apt numbers.  This is particularly awful if they don't have any at all.  People who illuminate or have reflective numbers on their homes are the chosen ones as far as I'm concerned.\n\n2.  Incorrectly entering their information online.   Then getting mad at the store because we couldn't find the house, nor call them to confirm the address because they put the wrong telephone number.  I thought the internet was supposed to make my life easier??\n\n3.  People who order 15 minutes before we close.  I get it, it's late and we're technically still open...but god-damn if I don't want to just go home and not be stuck inside until 3 in the morning cleaning because I'm out past closing time.  You know that pre-slapped, crusty ass dough has been sitting on the rack for 30+ minutes now right, and I'm not making you a new one cuz I already cleaned up all the corn meal.\n\n4.  Tell me on the phone that \"I'm in your area, you come here all the time.  So and so delivered here last time no problem\" when your address is CLEARLY out of our area and *I'm a driver who knows the area inside and out*.  You're not fooling anyone man, we don't go there.  Plain and simple.  You are not an exception to that rule, and I don't believe you will tip me more if I hook you up.\n\n5. Domino's specific: When people order extra dipping sauces online and they come up on the label instead of on my itemized sticky receipt. Extra: 0, get to the customer's house and lo and behold the parm bites had a marinara sauce on there.  Whhhyyyyyy???\n\n6.  When a customer calls to order their food and I say \"thanks for calling pizza chain, can I help you?\" And you hear them say \"What do you guys want?\".  This is just inconsiderate of my time, don't call me unless you know what you want already.  Or cool, you want to know specials, I'm down with that but please have some semblance of idea what you want, don't leave me waiting on you and your family to figure out you want 4 large pizza's and let's ask Bobby when he gets out of the bathroom what he wants.......and then 10 minutes have gone by while my phones are ringing off the hook.\n\n7.  People who don't tip.  Of course. But you just get on with the next delivery as quick as you can to minimize losses.\n\n8.  Customer calls to place an order.  \"Can I get your address\" I ask.  Response: \"UHHHHHHHHHHHH...?????\"  Dear God in heaven, I don't know where you are!  Google that shit!  I have asked so many customers, do you have a smartphone?  Google the name of the establishment you're in and give me that address.  Problem solved.  Why oh why do you expect ME to know where you're at or where you want this food delivered?   \n\n9. Deliver to house, no answer.  Call customer, \"Oh bro, we're at the gas station can you wait like 10 minutes and we'll brb?\"  FUUUUUUU.\n\n10.  Estimated time of delivery is 1 to 1 1/2hrs.  Customer: \"I can't wait that long, why is the wait so long?!  You're full of shit, you guys are always inflating your delivery times!\"  Ok, sometimes I do inflate the estimated delivery time, but that's usually because we're moderately busy and you never know when shit will hit the fan.  Most of the time, we're just busy, and while I recognize you're hungry, we're doing the best we can.\n\n11.  Coworkers who don't do shit inside the store to help things along.  Morning dishes are still there in the afternoon, the phone is ringing off the hook because no one wants to answer it.  Aprons are all dirty because no one did the laundry.  No boxes are folded.  Prep is a shit show.  The dumpster is full because some lazy fuck didn't break down the boxes.  Soda's need restocking but no one wants to do it.\n\n12.  Hospitals.\n\n13.  Customers demeaning me verbally for any reason.  I will hang up immediately if I am called a name or someone is rude to me.  I don't get paid enough to deal with that kind of attitude.  \n\n14.  I don't carry change for a 100$.  It's stupid, against policy, and dangerous.  I'm sorry.\n\n15.  Car toppers.  I feel like they're a huge sign on my car that says \"rob me, I have money\".  And they fuck up the roof of my car.  \n\nFeel free to add on, comment, say my list is stupid etc. :P",

Sometimes this process took about 5 minutes, as the dog was hyper and didn't want to go inside.\n\nAfter a few times of this and getting frustrated, it happened for the final time. The dog slips through the door as she opens it, I hand her her things, get the cash, and again she asks me to corral her dog inside. I just told her \"That's not in my job description, we're very busy, and I'm not missing out on another delivery because of this.\"\n\nNot my job. Just put your damn dog away yourself when you know you're going to order a pizza and you have a dog that's going to be a problem.\n\nTo the downvoters, no she wasn't disabled. Just lazy. I did miss out on several deliveries that would've tipped way better than her on multiple occasions because of her, and again, grabbing your dog because you don't know how to put it away is not in my job description.

        "text": "So it's a Saturday evening I decided to order a pizza from the corporate place just down the road.  Bacon and Pepperoni, greaseball classic, but it gets the job done.  I ordered online and get the e-mail saying that it'll be here in a half hour or so.  Nothing's showed up in the half hour, but I waited 50 minutes to give a call, it could be a busy night and all.\n\nThe person that picked up rambled through the deals and details before asking if I wanted delivery or pickup.  After telling her that I was waiting on my pizza she asked for my name, then told me it was \"On the way\".  \n\nFive minutes later, my dogs start barking at something outside.  I go to the porch and don't see anyone, wait there for a minute thinking that the delivery guy may be just around from where I can see.  I don't see any headlights as I'd think a car would have at night, so I go back inside.\n\nAfter waiting another half an hour I give the store another call.  I get the same disinterested person running through the specials and tell her I'm still waiting on the pizza.  She tells me to hold on and starts talking to someone else.  I hear that other person distinctly say \"Well I have the signed receipt here, what the fuck else do they want?\"  Bored order taker comes back and says that they delivered the pizza, there's nothing she can do about it.  If I want more pizza I have to order another one.  So, I asked to speak to the manager.\n\nThis time she puts the phone on hold and I wait to get someone else.  After telling the manager that I'd ordered a pizza and not gotten it, he echoes the \"I've got a signed receipt here, signed by an Aaron.  The driver said a woman signed for it and everything.\"  I told him I'm a guy, and home alone with my two male dogs, so I don't know how a woman here would have signed for it.  \"Well, how would they know to sign Aaron?\"  To which I had to ask if on the line above the signature if it had my name printed there.  \"Oh, well yeah.\"\n\nAfter this witty repartee the manager told me the best that he could do was offer me 50% off of another order.  When I suggested that what may have happened was an accident on the driver's part and minor fraud on a neighbor's part, and that I shouldn't be paying for that the manager got... snarky.  He said that if word got out that every time that someone called in about a missed pizza they made another pie then the word would get out there and he'd have to make double orders constantly.\n\nI was shocked and at that point went for the angry move.  I asked if then a call to corporate was what needed done followed by a call to my bank about reversing fraudulent charges on my card.  Only then did the manager think that maybe he should ask the driver about what house he really delivered it to.  I told him that I wanted that order voided out and that he should re-train his driver on verifying house numbers and card signatories.  He let me know that he would void out the order and that was \"the best he could do\".\n\nSo, am I right to be pissed off?  And should I call the corporate line?\n\nThanks for letting me vent, sorry if this isn't the right place for it.\n\nNOTE: Yes, I used my real first name, it's in my username.\n\nEDIT: Addendum!\n\n4 hours later, I decided to call the corporate line. My fiancee got home and was super pissed about what happened. She brought up the good point of with the way the manager sounded he likely round-filed the problem and without a legitimate complaint then there won't be any accountability.\n\nThe poor lady on the other end of the phone sounded like she was working the mother of all hell desks. I gave her the breakdown with times from the order and my phone calls. She also stated that the manager's response of being unable to refund the order was not in line with how business should be done. After she had my order number was able to confirm that the order had been canceled with a note of \"Possible fraudulent activity\". She amended the note to state fraudulent on others part, not my part, and then submitted a ticket about the unprofessional manner of the manager.\n\nI alternately feel bad about being \"that guy\" but at the same time hope that the people involved use it to improve instead of seeing a bitchy customer.",

        "text": "Again, I would like to thank /u/redditcoruum2 for keeping at me to tell my stories and helping me format this story so it will be legible. I fully understand these are not the stories you folks prefer to read, the funny stories, the stories that take just a second to digest. I have those types of stories too, they're just not as important to me to tell, sorry.\n\nI am also telling these stories to show other delivery drivers that they can better their working conditions. \n\n\n___\n\n\nSo this story starts back in October of 2014, Less than a year after [Story#1: Mileage Reimbursement Lawsuit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/3zs31w/story_1_mileage_reimbursement_lawsuit/).  My General Manager had sent me a text message:\n\n&gt; Just a reminder, MVR and copy of insurance is due close of business Sunday night, thank you all\n\nI was sitting eating a most delicious burger at the LunchBox Laboratory. I quickly sent back the following message:\n\n&gt; You can have a copy of my insurance card anytime I am at work. I will not be able to provide you my MVR, as doing so would reduce my net wage below minimum wage.\n\nAs soon as I sent that I looked at my dinner partner, another delivery driver I work with and told him, “**And the next battle begins.**”^1\n\nI let him read what I sent to our GM and then quickly sent out a text to most of the drivers^2 in our store letting them know that they should:\n\n1) Do nothing until I send them an email later in the evening explaining why they should not respond yet\n2) Let the GM know that providing him a copy of their  MVR would reduce their net wages below minimum wage and that they would not be doing so.\n\nThe driver I was at dinner with sent our GM a very similar message as mine and then we continued to eat dinner and talk about whatever. There were four (4) of us, out of ten (10) that sent to our GM that we would not be providing him with a copy of our MVRs. There was no immediate retaliation or any reaction at all.\n\nOver the next few days I started composing a few documents and speaking to most of the drivers at our location. One of the documents was an explanation of what was happening and the state laws that were being violated by our employer. Washington State has, usually, more beneficial labor laws than the Federal FLSA allows. I could have just quoted DOL rules and the FLSA, but I decided to keep it at the State level first. \n\nI asked each delivery driver to read, fill out, and sign a second document if they decided they wanted to make these claims with our employer. I also asked those that wanted to address this issue to sign a document giving me the authority to speak on their behalf.^3 It was a bit disheartening, but only one (1) delivery driver decided that he would make the claims. So I had him sign all the documents and he and I presented the following to our GM:\n\n&gt; *As a condition of employment Employer has required Employee to procure, and provide to Employer a copy of the Employee's Motor Vehicle Record (MVR). This requirement sets up a condition of employment where the Employer passes on a business expense on to the Employee. This expense, incurred by the Employee, causes the Employee's wage to fall below the state minimum wage. I believe this is a violation of RCW 49.52.050.*\n\n&gt;\t*In light of these violations, and RCW 49.52.070, I conclude that Employer is liable to Employee in the amount of $104 ($13 (cost of each individual MVR) multiplied by 2 (exemplary damages in accordance with RCW 49.52.070))*\n\n&gt;\t*To expedite the resolution of this issue and to forgo needing to involve the Washington State Department of Labor &amp; Industries along with the possibility of L&amp;I imposing stiff fines and possible criminal charges, or involving attorneys, the amount, $104, should be refunded to Employee to remain in compliance with RCW 49.52.050. This amount should be presented to the employee in the form of a non-taxable business expense, similar to how mileage reimbursement is paid out. This amount does not take into consideration the amount of time spent procuring the document, which is a work related task, but will be taken into consideration if this issue is not resolved expeditiously.*\n\nThen we waited. And waited. And waited. Four (4) months had gone by and we'd heard nothing back from management on his claims. So in February if 2015 I started composing another letter and convinced 2 more delivery drivers to make claims against our employer. The following is the letter I presented to our Director of Operations (an Operating Partner of the franchise or owner). Not shown are the two additional claims. Also not shown are the names of the employees or employer's real names.\n\n&gt; *To: Franchise Owner*\n\n&gt;\t*On or about October 11th, 2014 the General Manager of the locatio Papa Johns, store # XXXX, received a document from employee #1 which illustrated a minimum wage violation. This document was sent to franchise corporate offices on October 13th, 2014. The document contends that the company owned by Franchise owner has been in violation of various State and Federal laws resulting in a rebate of wages.*\n\n&gt;\t*It has been 4 months since the complaint has been made and franchise management/ownership has not responded, at all, to the claims made in the complaint. This lack of response seems to illustrate an unwillingness, by the employer, to address employee wage complaints. *\n\n&gt;\t*Even though no response has been made by our employer, during the past 4 months, we are still willing to give our employer the opportunity to quickly resolve this issue, without involving litigation or the Washington State Department of Labor &amp; Industries. If an acceptable arrangement has not been reached within 14 days of receipt of this letter, then alternate methods of addressing this wage complaint will occur.*\n\n&gt;\t*Attached is Employee #1's 2nd complaint, along with complaints by Employee #2 and Employee #3.*\n\n&gt;\t*elric92 is authorized to act on behalf of the above named employees. Contact elric92, using the contact information below, to arrange a meeting to resolve this issue.*\n\nI handed the packet of all the documents to our Director of Operations **and then waited...**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n___\n^1: Or something close to that. It was witty and poignant, or just plain stupid sounding.\n\n^2: There was at least one driver I refused to communicate with unless absolutely necessary, we just did not get along.\n\n^3: I had not provided an MVR in the past year and because of that I would not be presenting my own claims against my employer.",

Now I was already slightly annoyed as this order came in 10 min before closing but my manager said we have to take it. So I pull into the apartment complex and proceed to search for this guy's apartment for like 10 min (it was dark and 1/2 the building lights were out, also keep in mind that because of the size of our area our delivery time was never less than 45 min so I'm still barely on time to this guy). He answers the door and all I smell is cat piss/shit and pot, w/e I've had worse, then he goes to hand me a small wadded up damp cloth (which was wadded up around coins) I just grab what looks like the driest spot and give him his food as I want to get back so I can get home. Get to my car and count it out and it's short $5, not wanting to make a scene I just bolted out of there (and made sure to Rev my engine right by his door a few times before I left) \n\nHated that guy but on the bright side the next day the GM told me he blocked him from ordering from us again",

They said it was technically outside of their normal delivery range but since it was a slow night the driver didn't mind delivering us our food. The store was roughly 5 miles from the apartment (10 minute drive) and I would have gotten it if they didn't deliver. \n\nAnyway we order $20 worth of food and it  arrives 25 or so minutes later. I tip the guy 7 bucks because that's all the cash I had on me and thinking back I'm wondering if it was too low of an amount. So I thought I would get your guys opinions on it. Is a $7 tip reasonable given the circumstances? Or should I have tipped more? \n\nEdit: Thanks for the responses guys. I appreciate it. I feel better now about the tip I gave ",

        "text": "My GM works really hard. He's in the store for 70+ hours a week sometimes, he always makes sure we have what we need, and is generally a very cool person to work for. \n\nHe also has a great sense of humor. \n\nSo this week he got his first two days off in a row since he started at our store, months and months ago. He made sure to tell us he was going somewhere where cell service would be spotty, so he would not be available. He told us not to contact him unless the store was burning down, even then, maybe not. :) \n\nSo tonight while working I decided he would probably like to have a report of everything that happened while he was gone. I mean, a lot can go wrong or right in two days. And I thought it would be better if I wrote this down as it happened, so he could have the play-by-play when it was freshest in my memory. \n\nSo here's the email I sent him: \n\nWhile you were off, I thought you might like a report of everything that happened in store while you were gone. Forgive the journal format, it's how I write things down to remember them easiest in the moment: \n\nDear diary: Dress code has already started to deteriorate. Most of the employees are wearing yoga pants. This has increased tip levels, but some find the environment to be distracting.\n\nDear diary: Although our GM has only been incommunicado for 6 hours, we have all forgotten how to stretch dough. Someone found a cookie cutter in the shape of Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, so we are making do with that. The pizzas seem a bit small, though cheese usage is finally down to corporate standards.\n\nDear diary: Dress code compliance continues to fall. Hair is unrestrained and mostly blue. Several people are wearing pants they fashioned out of animal hides. No one knows where they acquired them.\n\nDear diary: A small flood has occurred in the store. When told to shut the water off, our assistant manager ended up turning off the internet instead. Now we have no way to order food from Pizza Hut. We are so hungry.\n\nDear diary: 12 cases of expired soda have been discovered in the back. It's now June. I thought our dear leader would only be gone for two days? Time no longer has meaning.\n\nDear diary: We have run out of credit card paper, mostly due to one our colleagues wrapping himself in it and declaring, \"I'm a mummy! Grr.\" We are experimenting with having our few remaining customers sign pieces of pepperoni. They are, alas, too greasy.\n\nDear diary: The oven has caught fire, and we cannot find the fire extinguisher. It may be covered up by the many cardboard box igloos we have built around the store. If those start to burn, all is lost.\n\nDear diary: Dress code continues to be increasingly violated. The pelts that employees have been wearing now cover their entire bodies, rendering them a dirtier, logo-covered version of the cast of Cats on Broadway.\n\nDear diary: One of our number has declared herself Supreme Pizza Overlord. She will not listen to reason. We have no Supreme pizzas on the menu. She must be stopped.\n\nDear diary: The flooded area in back is now starting to become a breeding ground for mosquitoes. We're starting to keep the back door open at night in hopes that native bats will eat them, but so far we have only gained more crew members from people who wander in looking for a place to sleep.\n\nDear diary: We have managed to put the fire out using the water from the mosquito/bat habitat. Despite rampant malaria, no one has died by it. And we have even managed to catch and eat a few of the bats using our tangled matted hair. Perhaps things are looking up.\n\nDear diary: Those who support the Supreme Overlord have attempted to dye their pelts and skin red with tomato sauce. This is resulting in a sickly orange hue. Many of us Rebels believe this shows the disfavor of the bread gods toward the Supremists. Conversely, we have colored our pelts blue with cheap hair dyes. After losing 3 team members to poisoning, we discovered it cannot be used on skin lest we die. We are certain the bread gods are testing our faith.\n\nDear diary: Our food stores are getting lower by the hour. We have finally resorted to picking the pits for sustenance. Our fallen comrades bodies are being stored in the walk-in. Even the blue ones. Just in case. Just in case.\n\nDear diary: My faith shrinks slowly over time. I no longer so staunchly believe Dear Leader will return someday to fulfill prophesy and bring order back to the store. Perhaps the Supremists are correct after all. No! I must remain strong against such heresy.\n\nDear diary: The Supremists have taken over the cut table, defending their territory with the obviously superior weapon they have found on the hot metal box. This pointy stick outreaches even the tallest members of the Rebel Alliance. Rumor has it that this instrument was used to pop bubbles in pizzas in The Before Time, but that is just an old religious myth. Obviously, there is no such thing as \"pizza,\" and there were any such thing, how would they make bubbles without mouths?\n\nDear diary: I have lost all hope in Dear Leader's return and, even his very existence. My last shred of belief in ancient superstitions has now been ripped away. I am off to join the Supreme Overlord in her quest to rule the store. There exists nothing more powerful in this land than the sharp stick which she possesses. Wish me luck.\n\nUPDATE:\nMy GM and I haven't worked together since I sent the email until last night. He said \"so fucking funny\" \"hilarious\" \"laughed my ass off\" &amp; \"I needed that after all the bullshit I came back to.\"\n\nAlso he forwarded it to the franchise owner.\n\nNot bad.",

        "text": "      Aight.. so a normal Sunday of delivering pizza, get two deliveries and put them in bags and POW I'm on my way. Now a day ago (approx 18hrs ago) it was snowing and we got just about 2 feet of that luscious white stuff ;) with the drift factor some places seemed more like 3ft. Now that the background has been laid out, onto the picture itself! First of all as I'm turning onto the street for my first delivery a tiny snow plow was working its way around the block, he saw me coming down the street and without a problem gave me enough room to squeeze through between a snow mountain and his plow. Yet after driving another 15ft or so a car is parked in the MIDDLE of the road (like an A$$) when he had more than enough room to do a proper parking job and be able to let a car pass through. At first I did not notice no one was in the car so I gave a little honk like \"hey, someone's behind you, lets move!\" I notice these two kids staring out their window in their house just watching me, staring me in the eyes and it was getting awkward (ya know when yours and someone else's eyes meet and you both don't look away) and I was starting to get annoyed (at this point in time another car came but from the other side of the road and could not pass through either). After a few minutes one of the kids finally realized that his car was blocking our way from both sides so he finally comes outside and in no rush whatsoever took his sweet ass time walking down the driveway, I rolled down my window and asked \"Is that car yours? Can you move it please!!\".. \"oh yeah I was just waiting for the plow to finish\" (sounded high as HELL). But yet his driveway was already cleared out and no other cars were in it LIKE WHAAATT DAAA FUQQQ!!!!! \n\n      Well then finally I'm back on my way and 4 houses later I arrive at my destination (yes, 4 houses down the block was where I had to deliver from where I was stuck. I would have gotten out and walked the rest the way but wasn't about to leave my car especially with other people out shoveling, the plow, anything could happen. A car was stolen from one of our delivery guys just when he parked in front the store to get another delivery real quick (so I'm not taking any chances). \n\n      SO THEN as I'm pulling up to the house to make the delivery I notice that they have not even came outside their house once since the snow ended (which was about 18 hours ago from this point) and nothing was shoveled. Their cars were buried, no path was shoveled in front of their door and the driveway was an adventure to get to the house. I see the wife (assuming) staring out a window I guess to watch out for me cause they were expecting food after all but I was not about to go marching through 2-3 feet of snow just to make a delivery. NOPE not gonna happen, you want the food, YOU come here and get it. So I stand there at the edge of the driveway as a man opens the garage door, puts on his boots and starts jumping and slipping around through the snow, trying to keep his balance using the cars for support (it was actually quite funny). So finally he makes his way to me and as he was about 4 ft from me he extends a shovel telling me to put the food and soda on it. I do so willingly, tell him the price, he slides the food back with money on top the pizza box, slides the food back to him, then asks for X amount of change back, slides the shovel with food and drinkage back at me I put the change on top the pizza box, thank the man and go on my merry way (not that great of a tip but at that point I didn't care anymore, I was over it and just wanted to get as far away as possible from that street). \n\n      As an end note, I heard giggling and crackling as I walked to my car from his neighbors that were outside shoveling their driveways and walkways. The next day I pass through the block and BAM the house was shoveled out, could have avoided the whole hassle is he'd just done it the day before when everyone else was :P\nDONE! Any other delivery guys out there have some annoying experiences delivering with snow?",

They said it all goes to the person delivering pizza. So I normally only give them like $2 on top of that so $5-6 dollars for delivery. Is this fair? Or am I a dick?

        "text": "I've done delivery (several different places) off and on as it made sense with life at the time. I've been working at my current place, a local place with just one location, since about July 2014 to help save up money for a house down payment and to try and finish off the ole student loan debt (got the house, only about $2k left on the loans!). So I've been working there about 3-4 months and it's more or less your average busy, not crazy, night of deliveries. I'm next up and this delivery is only a few minutes away from the shop. So completely ordinary if anything crossed my mind it was just that I may be back before any other driver's and get the next one too.\n\nI bag it up and roll out. A few minutes later I'm knocking on the front door of the house. It's maybe 6:30 - 7pm but it's like October so bright daylight still. There's no answer so I knock again a bit harder (I've been thanked before for no knocking on the door like i'm the police about to take it down). Still no answer so I knock one more time (three strikes and your out) and put some real gusto into in this time. Nothing, then I notice some young girls (like early grade school-age or younger) trying to get my attention from the little half size windows they have in basements. They wave me over to the side of the house with a carport, a boat, a trailer and what I presume to be some stairs that go down to the basement they waved from (note that there was a relatively large space still open, probably enough for a large truck). The said girls pop out and start running around and I start walking to the door to knock since I don't what exactly what they are doing and while still a good 10 feet or so away this guy, probably in his 30s, pops up the stairs all of the sudden with a shotgun whose barrel is pointed FAR more in my direction than I would certainly prefer. My initial reaction besides \"Oh !@#$, that's a shotgun is, that guy looks like he's been awake for about 30 seconds and has no clue what in the world is going on\". My brain starts running on auto-pilot and I decide the best course of action is to clearly identify myself to this clearly shotgun wielding sleep zombie. I say \"Hi there, I've got your order from's _____ Pizza.\" and shake the pizza bag in my right hand off to the side for him to see it clearly and the bag with the 2-liters of soda to the left. Note that where we are my car with pizza sign topper are not in line of site. I tell him that I just need to get a signature since it was paid for on VISA already.\n\nHe eyes me suspiciously and slowly comes over to where I am standing, with his shotgun STILL trained in my general direction. He doesn't say anything to me but takes my clipboard and pen and signs the VISA slip. I thanked him, stash it in my cargo shorts pocket (I find those pockets SO handy during the summer) and hand him the pizza's. He still doesn't say a word to me and takes the food and shotgun and disappears back into the house.\n\nNow that I can start thinking about not getting shot I AM PISSED. Beyond PISSED. It just happens that my wife is currently 7'ish months pregnant with are first child and this guy has the nerve to point a gun at me AFTER he asks me to bring food to his house. \nAND he stiffed me on the tip!\n\nI am raging internally, somewhat my specialty, but normally I can play things off and be cool after a few minutes. I get back to the shop and presume that I still looked as though I was about ready to tear someone in half because I see the assistant manager, a super chill guy that I joked around with all the time making epic 80's kid pop culture references, do a double take when he sees me. He very, VERY cautiously asks if I'm OK since I apparently am sporting the look of a hollowed out shell capable of anything. I run through the events of the last 10 minutes and effectively everyone in the store stopped working for a few minutes to be properly mortified. I had the pleasure of permanently blacklisting both the phone number and making sure the other driver's do not deliver there again.\n\nI really needed the job at the time and decided it would be for the best to never tell my wife about it as I didn't want to stress out an already stressed out pregnant woman. I knew it was one of those random ridiculous things and still work there now. Nothing half as crazy has ever happened since then but I usually flip the bird at said house when I drive by to this day (which is pretty often).\n\nIt's probably the closest I've come to being in a actual life or death situation and the fact that it was to deliver a pizza still makes me face palm.",

Ended up getting serious about it and buying a whip just for delivery (tiny car, great mpg, snow tires, no back seats, ect.). I ended up going back to school online (so I could still work full time), but really having second thoughts.\n\nAlso, currently at the second busiest store in the state, get scheduled the best closing shifts every week, and have great coworkers. So basically, I love it here. However, I really haven't had any sort of fun/hobbies outside of work for about two years due to school &amp; paying off student loans. My GF and I are probably moving this summer for her schooling.\n\nSorry about the long post, Just thought I'd ask for advice in case any of you guys have been in my shoes before. The only thing I'm concerned about is making way less money at another store after moving, but actually be happy/have a good work/life balance. I absolutely enjoy delivering at this chain (especially late nights) and wouldn't mind doing this long term. Has anyone else been in this situation/think its either a good/bad idea?\n\nThanks again guys, love this subreddit!\n\ntl;dr: Considering dropping out of college to have a better work/life balance due to my love for delivery. However, moving soon so might make less at another store.",

        "text": "So I started out as a delivery guy 9 years ago to pay for school and at least have a job.  Almost a decade later, a seemingly useless BA and trying to make it in the real world I went into management a few months ago.  I've made it to first assistant now at one of the busiest stores in the area.  It was going ok until sunday night.\n\nI knew it was going to be bad, like terrible no good oh my god make it stop bad.  It was worse.  We had closed early the previous 2 nights due to the weather and those were hell in of itself.  Sunday rolls around and I find that I'm the guy in charge with the GM and AD unavailable until around midnight.\n\nThe orders start coming in hard at around 5:30 and mind you we've already done 3x the normal for lunch.  I've got less than half the staff I need to run even a moderately more than busy night and we're already way past that.  By the time the football game hits I've got hour old deliveries on the rack.  By half time I'm looking at 2.5 hour old food still just sitting there.  The people on the oven can't keep it organized much less get all the food out of this triple stack of a cooker.  I'm running around like a mad man just trying to keep it all together, routing, slapping, dealing with the 20 people on the phones wondering where their food is.  It just didn't stop.\n\nI've been texting my GM all night and he knows whats up but he can't get to the store and I'm fully ok with that as he had something that he couldn't possibly miss to be there.  At quarter to midnight he asks what I want to do and I tell him we've got to shut it down.  I'm down to 1 driver as all the others don't feel safe driving as the roads are freezing over again in the neighborhoods.  I stopped making and taking deliveries going carryout only at around 10 but we've still got a routing screen all in the red and 2 pages long.  Internets been off for an hour before I made that call.\n\nI'd been through these nights as a driver and they were the most stressful I've had.  More half off weeks than I can remember, snow storms, play off foot ball.  But holy hell as the guy everyone's looking at to make it stop its a hundred times worse because at that point, when the pizza gods have decided to make your store their personal plaything there's not a damn thing you can do. \n\ntl;dr: the pie lords made me their bitch sunday night.",

        "text": "NC Pizza Slut driver here, been on the job for about a month and a half now. It's good work, and I enjoy it, but the past weekend there was a deluge of snow that covered a good portion of the roads in ice. \n\nThankfully, the day that I worked was quite nice, and the main roads (most of the side roads too) were clear, with only a few sections of the road requiring careful navigation.\n\nOne of my first orders of the day, however (I believe it was the third on a very busy day because of the football game,) was a house off the highway, about five minutes from the store. Usually for highway orders, or orders along any major road, I'll park my car off to the side of the street and walk up the driveway, especially when the weather worsens, because I don't want to be driving my car backwards onto a busy road.\n\nThis time, I didn't really have that option. Guy's driveway was a good quarter-mile long, a big, winding, ice-covered road that led uphill, with many cars driving by that prevented me from even considering parking the car on the side like I usually did. Because my tires are frankly rather rubbish, my car got stuck on the rock-hard ice that was absolutely coating the guy's driveway.\n\nThe customer told me he had considered walking to the end of the driveway (which would have been a reasonable thing to do, especially because he mentioned his own 4x4 truck had had trouble getting up the driveway) but he didn't want to miss the game. He at first was just going to pay me and leave me to figure it out on my own, but his wife convinced him to pull me out of the situation I had gone in, a process that took just about twenty minutes on one of the busiest Sunday nights we had.\n\nNo tip. No apology. \n\nLove the job to death, but some people, man.",

        "text": "I got some nice tips tonight from happy football fans and that got me thinking about the most exciting moment of my first stint in pizza. Let me take you back to a night one fall near the end of the last century. I was delivering at a small franchise of a big chain, and after 10 months I was already near the top of the seniority list, and I got a lot of closing shifts because I didn't bitch about washing dishes and I did a decent job of mopping.\n\nWe were in a college town, west coast. The tickets for the big rivalry football game were going on sale the next morning so there were a thousand students or so camped out at the stadium box office waiting to snag reduced price tickets. Someone called on a cell phone and asked if we would deliver to them in line, and promised a good tip. I took the run and it was a bit of a challenge to find the guy. I didn't have a cell phone in those days but here's a hint how different a world it was: I just pulled up to one of the many payphones in the parking lot, popped in a quarter, and called him. He came to where I was, paid on his card and tipped me $7 or so. I was pretty pleased, and suddenly a dozen other people were asking if they could order too. I made sure they all had the number for the store (I had magnets in my car to hand out!) and headed back. As I was leaving, I looked over at the empty gravel lot beyond where most of the students were, and a bright light caught my eye. There was a fire of some sort, and I slowed and could see a crowd of cheering college students screaming and cheering around a living room sofa, engulfed in flames rising high above their heads. I should have taken this for the omen it was.\n\nWhen I got back to the store, there were a couple more orders in and the store manager, I'll call him Sean because that was his name, told me I might as well take them since I knew what was up. I went back and found my first customer ready enough, who had enough sense to meet me near the payphone he'd seen me at before. The other one wasn't there, but after a while he appeared and paid. These two guys tipped decently, and I went back to the store again.\n\nI got back to find that the customer had called and complained that I'd driven off before he could get his pizza. The second guy who had come had jacked the order. At least he'd paid, I figured. I got a second pie down to the dude who'd got shorted. While I was delivering this time, someone asked me whether I was a fan of the home team or the rival team. To be honest I cared not a lick but I wasn't dumb so I told them Home Team, of course. \"Well why don't you have a sticker on your car? You'd better watch out, I hear they flipped over a car with a Rival sticker on it!\"\n\nAnyway, I did one or two more runs down there by midnight when I was the last driver. We delivered up till 1am back then but things were usually dead. Before I went out for my last regular run, I had a great idea. I told Sean that if he would make a bunch of pizzas, I would go down there and sell them to the crowd. He said, \"I'll do you one better, the store will sell you the pizzas at employee price, and you can keep whatever you make.\" Sean was cool like that but he also knew that I'd kick him in on the action. The employee price at the time was ridiculously good, food cost plus 10% or something. So anyway I came back to the store at 12:45 or so to find that Sean had 20 pizzas ready to go. I hot bagged em and stacked them all up in the back of my Subaru station wagon.\n\nWhen I got down there the crowd was still raucous. I rolled down my window and shouted, \"Who wants a pizza! Large pepperoni, $12!\" or whatever it was. After a bit I got out and did a couple sales. Things were going pretty good. Then I went to get back in and move over to another area when I noticed someone opening my tailgate. \"That's not cool!\" I shouted towards the guy who ran off with a hot bag and two Hawaiians. I was pissed, because paying for a hot bag would completely destroy my profits.\n\nI kept the doors locked after that, and my heart-rate stayed elevated. I was on high alert. Sold a few more pies, some of them too cheap because I was starting to want to get out of there. Then three girls came up to me timidly. \"We were wondering,\" one of them said, \"if you would give us a free pizza if I flash you?\"\n\nI was a little stunned by this but to be honest I was feeling pretty angry at this whole situation now. \"I'm sorry,\" I said, \"I really can't afford it. I already have to pay for the ones that got stolen.\"\n\n\"Aww, come on,\" said one of her friends, \"please?\"\n\n\"No, I'm sorry,\" I said.\n\n\"Come on,\" said the third one, \"what if all three of us flash you?\"\n\nNow about this time, some of the young drunk guys around me had noticed. \"What the fuck man,\" one of them said, \"are you saying you don't want to get a look at those?\" He moved creepily close and pantomimed grabbing the boobs of the girl with the biggest chest.\n\n\"Please, we're so hungry?\" The girls were begging me, batting their eyes. It was surreal. But I was still really angry, and I shook my head and made for my door. But by then the crowd had pushed in and I couldn't get there.\n\n\"Come on guys,\" said one of the drunks, then he shouted up a chant: \"show your tits! Show your tits! Show your tits!\"\n\nSuddenly I was surrounded by hundreds of people chanting: \"Show your tits! Show your tits!\" But it was obviously aimed at me. I was the gatekeeper of the tits. I was starting to see the nature of this beast, this drunken horny beast whose lair I had so foolishly entered.\n\n\"All right, fine,\" I said.\n\nThe crowd cheered. The girls crowded together. A couple of the guys started to try to negotiate terms on my behalf. The girls grabbed their shirts, and the crowd chanted down. \"One, two, three!\" The girls lifted their shirts all at once and at least a half dozen disposable camera flashes went off. The crowd cheered. I didn't even get a good look.\n\nI opened the back and gave the girls a pizza. They thanked me. I only had one left. A guy came up and I sold it to him for $10.\n\nI made for the driver's door when the crowd parted, and another young college girl under the arm of a guy came up to face me. \"My girl wants to flash you for a pizza too,\" he said. The girl honestly didn't seem too sure about this, she was blushing a lot. I couldn't help but notice that this young woman had a lot more to show than the other three had. The crowd was re-forming.\n\n\"Sorry,\" I said, \"I'm out of pizzas.\"\n\nThe dude started to bug me about it, maybe he didn't believe me, but the crowd knew how to solve this problem. They started chanting again: \"Show your tits! Show your tits!\"\n\nI shook my head again and slipped into the car. I started up and put it in gear, and started to roll forward. But the crowd formed in close around me. They were jeering, shouting. Someone started rocking the car. My mind flashed to the rumor of the upturned Rival car, the flaming sofa. The rocking became very strong. I feared for my life in that moment, I legitimately feared more than any other time before or since. I pumped the brake, let the car lurch a bit. This was an unwise provocation. The rocking was turning into a resonant side-by-side motion. At least fifteen young men had their hands on my car. I slammed my fist against the steering wheel to blare the horn, and stepped on the gas. The crowd managed to part. One of the young men jumped onto the hood. I rocked side to side, trying to expel him. I stopped quickly and he rolled off, then gave me a kick in the quarterpanel as I drove off.\n\nI went back and told most of this story to Sean, who laughed and told me not to worry about the hot bag or the lost pizzas. The pockets of my khakis were full of wadded up dollar bills and random change, and when I counted up my earnings I'd only made maybe $35 off the whole deal, which I gave Sean half of.\n\nSean refused to deliver to the stadium parking lot after that. The University also changed the system so there wasn't a big camp-out every year. It was a real scary lesson in the power of a mob with the mind of its own. Let alone a sex drive.",

        "text": "I had a delivery to the local college today.  Delivering to the college, you never know what you're going to get?  Maybe you'll be stiffed? Maybe you won't?  Maybe you'll see a breast, but you probably won't? ( I did witness a student repelling out the fourth floor dorm window in his underwear one time during a frigid January night, but that's for another time. )\n\nDeliveries to the college can be trying at times. Usually they go as planned. It's a quick transaction and you're on your way. However, that's not to say the college doesn't present its share of problem deliveries. \n\nToday was one of those days.\n\nI was working my normal ten hour shift.  Just as my mid-shift break was coming up, we got a delivery to the college.  I figured I could put off break for twenty minutes and run this delivery over first.\n\nI drive it over at lighting speed. The dorms are locked at this school, so, as I'm driving onto campus, I go to make my arrival telephone call to ask them to come out front.  I dial the number and get an automated message that this number is not in service. -This isn't uncommon on college deliveries.-  Unfortunately, I can never be sure of the reason.  Is their phone really out of service? Did they give us a fake number? Did the person taking the order type a wrong digit? I've seen all of these errors occur. I don't rush to make the judgement that the customer is an idiot, because sometimes it has been my own co-workers who turned out to be the idiots.\n\nFrom lots of prior experience, I knew full well that if I went back to the store, they'd call within five minutes looking for their food. Therefore, I elected to stay on campus and take my break in my car.  Called the store to ask them to call me if the customer called. I'd be hanging out in the parking lot.\n\nSo, I took my break. Smoked a Dutchie and waited. My half hour ended. Ironically, I hadn't gotten a call, so I head back to the store and take another run. When I came back, they'd finally called. Instead of their number being xxx-540-9977, it's really suppose to be 940-9977. Whoever took the order typed it in wrong!\n\nAt this point, the order is 1.5 hours old. We're going into dinner rush.  Again, I put the petal the metal and get over there as quickly as possible.  It's about 3.5  miles one-way. As I arrive, I go to make the call. Again, a different message comes up alerting me that this number is also not in service!\n\nI've got orders backing up at the store! They're all over town. I do a U-turn at the campus entrance and beeline it back to the store. I call the store again to let them know that this number is also not in service. I verify three times that yes, I'm calling the number they gave me when they called back after the first attempt. I didn't hear it wrong or misdial. The number is inactive, damnit!\n\nI got back, and somehow just barely got my other orders out on time.  When I get back, the customers's have called again! It's now over 2.5 since they placed their order.  This time, the problem turns out to be that when they gave us their correct number, the second time, they failed to mention it was an out of state area code!  If a customer doesn't tell us their area code when we take their number, we automatically assume it's local.  Therefore, even if the first three digits of the number had been right, it still wouldn't have worked because of the wrong area code.\n\nSo, now my store has messed up once. And the customer has messed up the second time! Again, I'm dispatched back to the college to serve as my store's ambassador.  I'm told to discount $10 if they give any problems. (Apparently, they'd been kind of angry on the phone)  But then, three minutes after I leave, my GM calls me to let me know that I only have two dozen of the four dozen wings they've ordered!  He admits it was his fault. He screwed up! He had unpacked the wings to reheat them, and in the dinner rush, somehow half the wings were missed by the new guy when they came back out of the oven! At this point, he now tells me to just give them the order for free.  He reasoned that we were already giving them two dozen wings free, so if they wanted to complain, then  let them! We didn't have time to go back a fourth time,  and he'd take the blame if we get a complaint to our headquarters. \n\nI finally got the order there three hours after it was placed. I did a \"drop and roll\"  Give them the food, apologize,  and get the hell out of there before they discovered they didn't have all their wings!  Didn't even attempt to wait to see if they tipped. Sure enough, they call pec me just as I'm leaving campus. I didn't answer, but I guess they called the store back, again. They weren't happy. I wasn't either. Just following my orders!\n\nThis is just the routine kind of thing that happens anytime you make a lot of deliveries to an institute of higher learning.  College deliveries are notorious for problems.  Just another day in the life of a delivery driver. I don't even get mad anymore, I just expect to have these things occur on occasion. \n\n",

        "text": "I deliver for a place in southwestern Virginia, right on the West Virginia border, and I witnessed something rather disturbing at work this evening. I took a delivery to a house on the WV side of our delivery area and when I got there, no one answered the door. I waited a moment before knocking a second time and then a tiny little girl (probably 3-4) pulled back the blinds and looked at me. At first I thought maybe the parent(s) hadn't heard me, so I waited yet again for a few moments before knocking a third time. Still no response other than the little girl. I tried calling the customer, but the phone number given was incorrect. I asked the little girl if she was alone and she said yes. I repeated the question to make sure and she started to cry a bit as she said \"always by myself\". Already perturbed, but a little confused, I said I would be back. I went to the car and tried calling the number again, and I was told once more that I had the wrong number. I had other deliveries with me, so I went ahead and took them even though I hated the thought of the little girl being there alone. After dropping off the other orders, I returned to the house and was again greeted by the grin of this precious little one. This time, however, she pulled the blinds back even further and I noticed another child there, this one was barely holding herself upright and sucking away on a pacifier. I again asked if there was a grown up with them, and just as before was told they were by themselves. I knocked anyway, this time hard enough to shake the house, and still the only response I got was curious looks and grins from the two kids. I went back to the store and told my boss what I had seen and then called 911 to report the incident. I've delivered to numerous houses where no one was home throughout the years, but this was a first. A good 60-75 minutes had gone by between my first visit and the time I left the house a second time - and its hard to tell how long they had been alone before I arrived. I'm sorry, but 5 minutes is too long to leave young kids of that age home alone. I'm still sick to my stomach even though four hours have now passed. I hope that the dispatcher sent an officer there. And, as much as I hate to think the kids were alone for another minute after I left, I kind of hope they were still alone when the cops arrived so that they could potentially do something to the worthless trash that left those little angels alone on a cold night. If any of my law enforcement friends see this and you know if those kids are no safe, please send me a message, I won't say anything more, I just need to know whether or not they got some help.\n",

At least I get to say I used to deliver pizza now. \n\nI just wanted to stress a few things that get brought up from time to time...\n\n- Carry a clipboard, and get a better than average pen. \n\n- Always give your customer a courtesy call if you're ever going to be more than 10 minutes past promised time\n\n- Read back the complete order at the door, and always offer to show the customer their pizza before you hand it over. If there's a mistake or miscommunication, it's better to handle it at the door than in the store. \n\n- Even if you hate sports, keep up with the game, and pretend you're a local fan. \n\nI worked in the best area possible. I rarely got stiffed. There was only one motel, which was only 15% shady at most. We didn't deliver to the neighborhoods that could even remotely considered bad. Many of my customers showed me genuine respect (more so than my employers), and it was great serving them. I kind of expected more weed tips than I got (3 in the whole span), and didn't expect as many beer tips as I got (never opened em on a shift!). \n\nMy only regrets are not being able to tell the top customers that I appreciated them, and that I didn't reenact that scene from Half Baked. Heck... Scarface or Jim Breuer would have been applicable. \n\n\n\nSorry for that time I broke rule 1, mods. Thanks for not banning me. (Not sarcasm)\n\nhttp://imgur.com/6afzi1I",

The numbers were laid out a little weird, as in they made absolutely no sense, so I called to get some clarification. The woman who answered was of little help, repeatedly saying something like, \"Yeah, the second one on the left!\" After circling this damn complex two more times I see her waving at me walking down her driveway that is more like the 4th or 5th drive on the left. \n\nBefore I even pull up all the way, she's already screeching at me , with a very upset look on her face, \"What part about second left didn't you understand?\" Taken aback a little, I told her while still seated in my car, \"You don't have to be rude about it.\" She flies off the handle after this, and I honestly don't exactly remember what was said between us but it was a very tense moment. I do remember holding onto the receipt and pizza while she grabbed at them because I think I was contemplating not giving it to her or something? I dunno, I was so frustrated that I sort of blacked out.\n\nAt the end of our transaction she of course says she's going to call the manager and have me fired. \"For what?\" I asked several times with no real response. I called her on her bullshit and she didn't like it? I told her (paraphrasing) to call the store because nobody gives a shit and have a nice day. I never even got out of my car. GM is obviously a little irritated, but just says I should have just apologized. Well, of course I apologized for the *slight* inconvenience because it's the customer service (as well as Domino's) motto, but what am I supposed to say when I am asked a direct question such as that one?\n\nSo, any of you have similar experience? If so, what did you do? Or how could I have handled this situation better because frankly I am not proud of the way things went down. How do you tactfully tell someone they're being an asshole and to cut the shit while they're your customer?",

        "text": "The state of apps for helping delivery drivers is terrible. I think there are only three available, two for iPhone and one for Android. The Android version looks legit, but I have an iPhone so it doesn’t count.\n\nThe app I am using (Deliver Driver) barely does more than an Excel document (and there’s a $7 app that looks like it does even less). There’s still a whole lot of manual editing I have to do to get my reports to show the correct totals. The shifts feature is also completely worthless. It should actually be called “Universes” or “Timelines” because when you change shifts any data for any other date won’t appear until you go back to that shift for that date. So, if I have a shift today (Saturday), I create a new shift for this date (Shift A). When I create Shift B tomorrow, and I scroll back to Saturday’s date on the calendar to see my reports, it will show me nothing unless I switch back to Shift A. Or maybe I don’t know how to use it, but anything on an app for delivery drivers shouldn’t take longer than ten minutes to figure out.\n\nAll I want out of a delivery app:\n\n* Set store specific settings such as reimbursement, work week, stuff like that.\n* Address storage with statistics (how many deliveries, tip average, tip % average, days since last order, etc…) and any relevant info (phone numbers, notes). Deliver Driver does this okay. \n* More classifications for addresses (House, Apartment, Hotel, Business, Govt. Building) with relevant info for each. I think all three apps available only have “house” or “apartment” as options.\n* A shift feature that actually works AND doesn’t require a five minute explanation to use. How about this:\n       \n1. A “clock in” button and a “clock out” button. The “clock in” button will start your shift, and the “clock out” button will end your shift. \n1. Any addresses you go on during your shift get stored as deliveries in that shift.\n1. A list of all shifts which you can edit the details of.\n\n4. The ability to generate reports with a filter for different time periods. Delivery Droid does this, but Deliver Driver does not.\n\nDoes all of this sound like common sense?",

        "text": "So, I've been doing deliveries for Domino's since early December. Generally, the deliveries are quick, 5-10 minute drives, and the city I live in (Windsor, Ontario, if anybody is curious) is generally grid based, so it's relatively easy to get anywhere within my delivery area.\n\nSo, around 8 PM or so, the on duty supervisor gets a call from some girls, who, after requesting the \"hottest driver on duty\", ordered one pizza and some cheezy bread. He confirms the address being downtown Windsor, slightly outside our delivery area.\n\nI'm up next for delivery, and after my Blackberry's GPS considered the address invalid, I reconfirmed the address with the supervisor, and he said, yeah, it's downtown, and we have to take said delivery for some reason. I don't really care about going downtown, since it's about 7 km away. After arriving, I try to find the address.\n\nAfter a minute, I give the customer a call, where some airhead teenage girl answers. She tells me she has no idea what the area is, then passes it to somebody else, who tells me it's not in downtown, but in a neighboring town (Tecumseh), 20 km from downtown Windsor. I place that in my GPS, and start driving.\n\nImmediately after, I call my store and tell them I'm making a delivery to Tecumseh, and I'm not happy about wasting my time, money, and gas on this delivery. Of course, the supervisor basically tells me to finish the delivery and come back. So I do so, after about a 30 minute drive (traffic, mixed in with driving along a two lane road as I wasn't aware how far it was), I arrive.\n\nSo, after arriving, I knock on the door, where there are like a dozen teenage girls around. And they don't even have the damn money ready. So after spending 10 minutes, I get 3 $5 bills, and some change. Already frustrated, I decide to count the change after walking back to my car, and it's exact change. I quite literally said \"Fucking bullshit\" as I got into my car and drove off, utterly furious.\n\nI get back after a 14 km ride, which the supervisor basically shrugs it off, even though I think it's complete bullshit that I even had to bother with this delivery. I put 45 needless kms, and wasted an hour of my time. \n\nMy standard pay is $6 an hour, plus whatever tips. I'm an \"independent contractor\" but I never actually signed any contract when starting. Should I bring up this situation with the GM of the franchise and see if I can get a $10 or something as compensation for what wasn't my fault?\n\nAlso, I'm currently driving a 2010 Buick Lacrosse CXL with about 67000 km on it. In total, from working 3:30 PM to around 10:30 PM, I made about $75, and put a total of 115km (including the drive to and from the store). Am I murdering my car for pocket change, or should I stick it out? ",

I see news articles and shit of pizza drivers in horrible wrecks and mangled cars with pizza toppers atop them, but how many of you guys ever have experiences like that? One happened to me just once. I was driving down the road and I stopped behind a minivan who was wanting to turn into the turning lane but couldn't because some hood rats thought that was a good place to wait for the traffic to clear up to cross. So I pull behind the van and suddenly, I hear this screeching sound and WHAM - I jerk forward a bit. I then come to the realization I've been rear ended! Fuck no! I get out of my truck, fuming mad. As I walk over to the pickup that rear ended me, I can tell the grille/radiator is broken and cracked, their bumper was dented, and their headlight was broken out. As I pass the end of my truck, I turn over expecting the worst and - nothing's the matter. Maybe just a scratch on the bumper, holy shit. I was thankful that day and I was talking to the kid who rear ended me, I didn't get the insurance called on him or however that works because one, his day was already fucked up and second, I didn't want my own rates to go up just because of something that's barely noticeable. So I just left it be, wished him the best, and went back to the store to pick up my next run. I don't know what it was, if it was God looking over me, the idea that fantastic plastic crap bumpers don't show much damage than metal ones, or just dumb luck, but that was months and months ago and I've been driving fine ever since.\n\nSo what's your story about getting in wrecks or anything while delivering, if you did?",

Are you here for pickup? \n\nHelga: Yeah, I’m picking up for [name].\n\nMe (*Go into the computer, find the order*): All right, it’s going to be $14.98.\n\nHelga opens her wallet, which has several $100 bills, and hands me one of the bills. My manager, Matt, happens to be standing next to me, so I give him the bill to check and see if it’s legit. He runs his fingers over it and almost immediately shakes his head.\n\nMatt: Ma’am, I can’t take this.\n\nHelga: Why not?\n\nMatt (*hands her the money back*): I can’t take it.\n\nHelga: Why?\n\nMatt: Because this bill is fake as hell!\n\nCue moment of awkward silence.\n\nHelga (*filing bill back into her wallet*): I don’t have anything else.\n\nMatt: I’m sorry about that.\n\nHelga: So you mean I’m not getting my pizza?\n\nMatt: I guess not.\n\nHelga rolls her eyes, but surprisingly, she doesn’t fight him and just walks out of the store. I ask my manager how he knew the bill was fake, and he says it’s because it didn’t look “right” and Benjamin Franklin’s shirt didn’t have the proper texture (it felt smooth when the shirt is supposed to be ridged). And that, based on her wallet and how she was dressed, Helga didn’t look like someone who would just have $10,000 cash on her person. We all laugh about it and move on.\n\n20 minutes later, one of our drivers walks in with a confused look on his face. Apparently, a strange woman had run up to his car when he pulled into our parking lot, and offered him $100 to run into the store and bring her the pepperoni pizza from the rack. Of course, having more than two brain cells to rub together, the driver turned her down and came back inside the store, leaving her empty-handed\n\nThe funny thing is, there is a bank 100 feet from us. It’s literally right in front of us, and there's also three other banks within a 2-minute walk from the store where she could’ve had the $100 bill broken up. But she obviously didn’t because, as my manager put it, that bill was “fake as hell”. ",

        "text": "During a moment of rest yesterday after getting hit during the game, I gave my only cook (a trainee) a short break. As soon as I did, two orders popped up on the screen. I began working on them until I noticed movement out of the corner of my eye. I looked over to see one of my drivers coming in from a delivery. From where I was, I could only see the door and a small portion of our lobby. But I could see the driver start talking to someone up front. I had been standing by our very noisy oven, so it was possible that I didn't hear our doorbell go off. Upon further inspection, I saw a woman waiting behind the counter just out of view. So I said, \"Hang on, I'll be with you in a moment!\" and promptly finished the first order, washed my hands, and went to the front counter. Took maybe 30 seconds. Cue conversation with customer:\n\n**Me:** \"Hey, how may I help you?\"\n\n**Customer:** \"Is there *another* manager I can talk to?\"\n\n**Me:** \"Uh... No, I am the only one here. Is something wrong?\"\n\n**Customer:** \"Well, I've been standing here for three minutes and you haven't said anything to me. I don't even want your food anymore, just give me your boss's information and I'll be on my way.\"\n\n**Me:** \"I'm sorry, I didn't see you come in at all.\"\n\n**Customer:** \"I have an infant in my car and you didn't even say anything to me!\"\n\n**Me:** \"I'm so sorry about that, I was working over there next to the oven and I didn't notice you come in.\"\n\n**Customer:** \"I work in customer service!!\"\n\n**Me:** \"Okay... so do I... so you were here to pick up the order for _______? I'd be happy to give it to you for free.\"\n\n**Customer:** \"No, just give me your manager's information and I'll have [another location] deliver my food.\"\n\nAt this point I'm a little disappointed because I had taken this woman's order over the phone and she was incredibly nice to me then. So nice, in fact, that when her order came out not looking very good, I thawed out new sauce and used the last of our pasta to make her a new one. That's also the reason why I was willing to give it to her for free. But since she didn't want it, I went ahead and told her that I was not able to give his personal information out to customers and that she would have to call the store while he was working. She asked how she was supposed to talk to someone who could handle the situation. I repeated myself and told her she would have to call the store on another day (our upper management situation is a little complicated at this time). So she left unhappy. I apologized again once she left, and after she did, I mumbled an expletive. Then my driver came back over and did the same. I cancelled her order and moved on.\n\nA few minutes later, I came around the corner only to see my other driver talking with the same customer. I was going to avoid her and go about my business, but I could see that he was trying to take her payment, which he needed me for since I had the till. So I returned to the counter and offered my assistance. The customer is obviously ignoring me and only looking at/ communicating with my driver. That's when I notice that her order is the exact same thing as before. For delivery. She is inside the store ordering for delivery. Oh well, whatever. I was going to just go with it, but the pasta I had made for her before was in the trash now, so I explained that we would not be able to make another one. She was obviously upset by this. I tried to explain the extent I had gone to get her order done ans I asked why she insisted on acting this way after I had tried to be nice. She just said \"Oh, don't worry... you'll be hearing from me again,\" and she went to leave. All I could say was, \"Wow,\" and my driver just stood there probably very confused.\n\nThen she poked her head in once again and the last thing she decided to say was, \"You're a fat piece of shit!\"\n\nWell, golly. Good thing I had witnesses. I hope she does try to contact my RGM.",

        "text": "My pizza chain has online ordering. I mostly love it because I don't have to answer nearly so many long, annoying phone calls, but there are times it's rather frustrating. People are just constantly putting stuff in the delivery instructions field that does not belong there. \n\nTwo nights ago it was \"pizza well done please.\" I noticed it as I was packing up the order and I had to have our cut table guy take the already-sliced pizza out of the box, put it back on a screen and send it back into the oven. The web system has a field for each item for you to put cooking instructions, but I think a lot of folks miss that. \n\nAlso recently had one person that put that they didn't want the garlic oil crust on the pizzas in delivery instructions because they are vegan*. The oil had already been put on when I discovered that note so I had to ask the kitchen to remake the pizzas.  I hadn't realized before that that particular oil is made with parmesan cheese, so is not vegan-friendly. My two coworkers didn't understand why I couldn't just bring the pizzas the way they were. I actually had to explain that veganism really does mean no milk or cheese, and yes it is very important to the customer to get this right. \n\nLast night we got a negative online review from someone who had claimed they \"ordered extra side of red sauce\" specifically in the delivery instructions field and were mad that they didn't get it. The web ordering system makes clear that sauce cups cost $.65 each as it offers them throughout the process.\n\n\"Bring red peppers and parm\" is my least favorite one to see. My franchise only has them in little plastic shaker bottles for $.99 each. The parm needs to be refrigerated too so we don't carry them around.  Most people that do this are expecting that we are like other pizza shops that give you a free packet or two of each so I don't blame them much. I used to bring one of each shaker with me in those cases where it was there, offering to just ring it up later at the shop but NO ONE ever wanted to pay for it. \n\nNow I just have a lil sentence I say about the parm and peppers no long being available in the free packets, so sorry. I know I'm gonna get a shitty tip on those runs as though this is my fault. \n\nLast night I saw the delivery instruction \"Bring an extra pizza from the ready rack - Paul**\"  I ask around the shop, no one knows a \"Paul\" and I'm certainly not bringing some old pizza for free to a customer on a delivery. I get there and it turns out this guy used to bike for one of our sister stores (he thought he was in their delivery  area) so I don't blame him for trying, I guess. Just a little inappropriate In my mind.\n\nNow, one good one: A message in the instructions that said something like \"Love yourself and be kind to your body.\" When I got there they were wearing feminist*** themed t-shirts and I told them I loved their message and the shirts. As I left they shouted \"smash the patriachy\" and I responded with \"Misandry 4eva!\" It was a lot of fun. \n\nHave you had anything that didn't belong in your delivery instructions? \n\n* I'm guessing the mods don't want long, boring, annoying arguments about vegans in the comments here, so, whatever you are about to say about it, stop typing. \n\n** Name changed to protect the guilty/innocent/whatever \n\n*** I'm guessing the mods don't want long, boring, annoying arguments about feminists in the comments here, so, whatever you are about to say about it, stop typing.

        "text": "Whenever I have to place an order on the phone, we have to give an estimated time it'll take for the pizza to get from the oven to whoever's house. It's usually thirty minutes, but on really busy times it can be up to seventy minutes. Despite this, it can show up earlier than the intended delivery time, which is a good thing because not only it's good for me in the sense that I can get back to the store and do dough or dishes or what have you, but whenever the customer states \"Wow, you got here fast\", I get to be a smartass and say \"If you want me to circle the block, I can\".\n\nBut despite that, there's still people who think they can beat the pizza guy. I've delivered to houses that nobody was there and when I called the number on the receipt, they said they were down the street or at the store or what have you. One of them thought a thirty-minute-delivery-turned-ten-minute-delivery was enough time to take a long shower. Hell, a week or so ago, I got yelled at for delivering a pizza early. \"Why did you get here so early!? I was driving home from work and you shouldn't have been here for another ten minutes!\" and then when I tried to literate to them why, in the future, that the estimated delivery time shouldn't be taken with face value, they said \"There goes your tip\" and closed the door in my face.\n\nVenting aside, make sure you're actually there to get the pizza. Don't think for a minute the estimated delivery time is as factual as an encyclopedia. We could be earlier, we could be later. Don't run to the store, don't take a shower, don't fall asleep in the mancave watching the Redskins game. And for fuck's sake, actually be where you intend to receive the pizza when you place the order. Don't be at an office building 20 miles away. Trying to beat the pizza is like trying to beat a train, but instead of medical personnel having to remove your lifeless corpse from a vehicle impaled onto a locomotive's coupling, you make the pizza guy mad. That's equally bad, if not worse.",

        "text": "This isn't a long story, but thought I'd share. This happened tonight while I was cashing out. I thought I'd heard and seen it all when it came to customer ignorance. \n\nI'm standing at the register counting up the money for my delivery shift.  Older gentleman comes in.  Not so old that the Grim Reaper could be waiting in the passenger seat when he goes back out to his car, but probably early sixties? He's coherent and normal.  Not showing any confusion like really old people often do when they come in to order pizza. (I don't think old people really eat much pizza from my experience. I rarely deliver to anybody over 65-70) \n\nHe wanted to place a carry-out order, so I stop what I'm doing for a minute to take his order and cash him out.  I tell him the total, and he hands me his card.  Not sure if it was debit or credit? \n\nI swipe his card.  The payment processes in about three seconds and his receipt prints out.  I tell him they'll call his name when his food is ready. I hand him the receipt and a then notice a look of confusion in his eyes. \n\nI ask if everything's all right? He responds, \"I don't know? Is that all there is to it? I've never done this before.\" \n\nMe: I'm sorry?\n\nCustomer:  Do I have to do anything else? I mean, uh,  I've never paid with a card before. Wow, that's really it?\n\nMe: Sir, you are all set!\n\nCustomer: You're sure I've paid?\n \nMe: Yes, it went through. You're all set. That's your receipt. \n\nCustomer: Wow, that sure is something!\n\n\nI then cashed out and got out of there before his food was ready.  It really left me wondering where this guy has been for the past thirty years? It really made me giggle after a long hard shift.",

My coworker and I ordered pizza because we are working together the next few days and the food there is mediocre at best.\n\nInstructions were to go to the front and call my cell on delivery, as we aren't always looking at that camera.\n\nWell. He does. In the middle of a fight that had broken out in one of the pits, and one crafty gentleman taking advantage of the confusion to steal some chips. So we are there swinging all available cameras to this fight and my phone rings. \n\nI was a little curt on the phone because, well, issues. I asked him to wait about 10 minutes. Was closer to 15 by the time security had dragged one guy right past the pizza guy to our floor holding cell and the other one to our upstairs cell.\n\nI went down really apologetic, and he seemed cool. We tipped him 20 on a 30 dollar order for making him wait.\n\nI hope he's not too pissed off or in shit from his boss",

        "text": "I'll start with stating that I've never delivered a pizza, but I did deliver sandwiches for a local restaurant fore a few years before I finally made the life decision to go back to college.  Hopefully you fellow pizza delivery folk can sympathize and appreciate.\n\nI was a year and a half into my tenure as a full time delivery driver.  I had grown numb to the usual angry customer or customer who seemed inconvenienced by the fact that I was showing up to deliver the food that they had called and ordered.  This story goes a bit beyond that.\n\nIt was the 1st delivery of the day, and I had the pleasure of taking the phone call.  It was a lady, we'll call her Betsy, from a local doctors office.  Many of the employees there were regular customers, but this is the only time I had ever heard from Betsy.  She ordered her sandwich, fries, and a drink to go with it.  I hopped into my old, beat up Honda and delivered her food to her.  We made small talk while she filled out her credit card receipt and I went on my way.  Not even 5 minutes after returning to the shop, the phone rang again.  It was the same doctors office calling again. It was not unusual to go to the same place 2-3 times in a day, so I thought nothing of it.\n\n\"Hello! How can I help you?\"\n\n\"This is Betsy from doctors office.  I'd like to know why you changed the ingredients on your Italian sandwich.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry Ma'am, but we haven't changed the ingredients of our Italian sandwich since I've worked here.\"\n\n\"I come in to your restaurant 3-4 times a week and always order the same sandwich.  I know what comes on it and you made me something completely different.\"\n\n\"What normally comes on the sandwich you order?\"\n\n\"Ham, grilled onions, mayonnaise, banana peppers, and provolone\"\n\n\"Ma'am, that is not the Italian sandwich, that is the smoked ham club.\"\n\nAt this point her tone completely escalated.\n\n\"NO IT'S NOT, I EAT THIS SANDWICH SEVERAL TIMES PER WEEK, I KNOW WHAT COMES ON IT!!\"\n\nI think it's worth mentioning that I worked usually 45-55 hours per week and had never seen this woman before in my life.  I decided it was best if I put my manager on the phone with her as he had worked at the restaurant since day one.  If there ever was a change to one of the sandwiches, he would be the one to know.\n\nHe spoke with her for about five minutes, and after getting tired of hearing her complain, he decided to send me back out with the correct sandwich at no charge on the condition that she would return the incorrect sandwich to me upon my arrival, to which she agreed..  This was a strict rule we enforced.  All we did was take the sandwich back to the shop and throw them away, however we did this to send a message to the customer that calling and complaining about something minute will not get you two sandwiches for the price of one.\n\nI arrived to swap sandwiches.\n\n\"Here you go, Ma'am.  I apologize for the mix-up (that wasn't our fault),  I'll need the old sandwich back please\"\n\nSLAM!, she slammed her office door in my face.  After standing in the hallway, confused about what just happened, I gently knocked on her office door again.  She then peeked her head out from inside.\n\n\"WHAT?!\"\n\n\"Ma'am, I will need the incorrect sandwich back before I can leave.  My manager said he confirmed this with you over the phone (I knew for a fact that he did as I was standing right next to him while he was talking to her).\"\n\n\"THAT'S DISGUSTING.  YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE THAT SANDWICH BACK INTO THE RESTAURANT?!?!  I'M REPORTING THIS TO THE CITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT\"\n\n\"Ma'am, we just throw the sandwich away.  We just want people to understand that they won't get a free sandwich if something is made incorrectly.\"\n\nSLAM, she slammed the door in my face again.\n\nAgain, I gently knocked on her office door.\n\n\"WHAT DO YOU WANT?!?!\"\n\n\"Ma'am, as I said before, I need the incorrect sandwich before I can leave.\"\n\n\"I ALREADY THREW IT AWAY SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT.  GET OUT OF MY OFFICE, I'M VERY BUSY!!!\"  \n\nThis outburst, again, was followed by a SLAM of her office door.\n\nI stepped outside to call my manager to see what he wanted to do.  He told me to request visual proof the sandwich in a garbage can and that if she wanted to eat it out of the trash, that was her prerogative.\n\nI walked back inside, skipped past the reception area, and went straight to her office door and knocked with a bit more force this time.\n\n\"WHAT DO YOU WANT?!?!?! I TOLD YOU I THREW THE SANDWICH AWAY\"\n\n\"That's fine Ma'am.  If you can just show me the garbage can with the sandwich inside, I'll be on my way\"\n\nSLAM!!!!\n\nShe had just slammed her door in my face for the fourth time.  I had endured everything I could and decided to take matters into my own hands.  I opened her office door.\n\n\"Listen, your order is still open in our computer system because I haven't applied the tip to your order to close it out.  Either give me a sandwich or you will be charged for two (all of this was a lie, by the way).\"\n\nShe said the following while reaching into her purse and handing me a rolled up greasy food bag.\n\n\"THIS IS THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I'VE EVER HAD.  I'M CALLING YOUR MANAGER AND DEMANDING THAT YOU BE REPRIMANDED FOR THIS.  I'VE NEVER BEEN TREATED SO BAD IN MY LIFE.  I'M NEVER EATING AT YOUR RESTAURANT AGAIN!!!!!\"\n\nI walked back into the restaurant with the bag in my hand.  I saw my manager talking on the phone and had a pretty good idea of who he was talking to.  I walked up next to him and could hear her muffled yelling over the noise of the kitchen.  He was throwing in the occasional \"I'm sorry\" and \"Yes Ma'am, I'll be sure to address this with our driver\".  While he was wrapping up his phone call with an offer of a free sandwich on her next visit, I opened up the bag she had given me and revealed the contents to him while he was still talking.  Inside was about two bites worth of what once was a sandwich and some empty mayonnaise packets.  He stopped talking mid-sentence and directed his voice toward me.\n\n\"Is this the sandwich she gave you?\"\n\n\"Yep\"\n\nNow directing his voice back toward her.\n\n\"I'm sorry Ma'am, but we're blacklisting your number.  We will not be delivering to you again.  Have a nice day.\"\n\nHe then promptly took a piece of paper and wrote \"DO NOT DELIVER TO BETSY AT DOCTORS OFFICE\" next to the phone and taped it to the wall.  I still keep in contact with this manager as we became pretty good friends.  This happened in 2008 and the note is still next to the phone to this day.\n",

You can kind of see where this going.\n\nI was on my way home and after about 20 minutes of placing the order, I get a call saying the driver's at my house and no one's there. Normally they take like 45 minutes to an hour so I was shocked he was already there. We always get the same driver who's a really cool dude, I know him on a first name basis.\n\nAnyway, I got home in 3 minutes, and tipped him 8 dollars instead of the usual 3 for his troubles, and everything seemed cool but I still felt bad.

        "text": "So I had an issue a while back where I severely sprained my ankle on the job and the GM ignored it and made me work about a month on it, then when the pain became too much, I had to take 3 weeks unpaid leave because he said that I didn't report it in a \"serious manner\". I didn't realize there was a certain way to report an injury other than saying that I hurt myself and it hurts, but apparently I was to word it differently. I got past that, I'm healed up, but now I'm having other issues and I'm feeling totally at fault and I'd like to get some other input from my fellow drivers.\n\nSince returning from the injury, things have been really tense between us (Me and GM). I am a single mother and I am now in school full time, but I have still been working 35 hours a week.  My normal schedule on paper is 11:30 am- 12:30 pm, then from 3pm - 8 pm. I usually end up having to stay until 1:30 or 2, then I come back at 3 and end up having to stay until 8:30 or 9. This upsets me, because I don't feel that I should stay late every single shift, and that it should be optional instead of required. He's gotten extremely angry at me any time I've asked to get off at my normal time. \n\n\nOne incident a couple weeks ago, I agreed to stay completely through my break  so the opening driver could go home early. We ended up getting slammed and I was the only driver there for about 5 hours. When I asked to go home at my designated time at 8 because I hadn't eaten and I was completely exhausted, I was yelled at and I had to stay another 2 hours. \n\nI feel like I'm being unreasonable by wanting to only work when I am scheduled, and I'm ridden with guilt. At the same time, since I've started school I asked for a reduction of hours, I feel like it isn't entirely unreasonable to expect it.\n\nThis week, he finally adjusted my schedule so that I was off work in time for my classes on Wednesday, but instead of keeping me on my regularly scheduled days off, took one away and made it a full day so that I was working 6 days this week. I ended up not realizing that I didn't get my normal two days off because I did know my schedule for the rest of the days, assumed that I would have 2 days off, and I was indisposed because I had a rescheduled class and I regularly keep my phone off or on silent on my days off because he sends out 10+ mass text messages about store stats. I unintentionally no call no showed, and I explained to him what happened, and he yelled at me further. I feel like asking him to allow me to work less to accommodate my difficult class schedule, he's scheduling me to work more. I know this is not really an interesting story, but I'd really love to hear your inputs on how you would handle the situation, if I'm being an entitled dickhead by expecting a set schedule, or whatever else.
