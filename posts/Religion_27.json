        "text": "I was born and raised Christian. My family started out raising us in pentecostal/evangelical churches, but as we got older we calmed way down and attended a very even keeled Methodist church that I really liked. Still, for nearly 10 years now I have thought about converting to a different religion (I won't get into specifics). I guess I have one big \"issue\" with the whole thing:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI'm not sure how faithful I'll be. Sure, I was born Christian, it's something I feel comfortable in. I'm not going to lie and say that I've agreed with all aspects of Christianity. When I was younger I was very against some things like premarital sex but didn't listen to the kids in my youth group who said that Harry Potter was devil worship. I feel like converting to a new religion means you need to be a model convert and adhere to everything. Like, Christianity generally frowns upon pre-marital sex, but that is something I have made peace with not worrying about because of how damaging that mentality was for me in my formative years. If I converted to a different religion that did the same, I'd feel like a \"bad\" convert for not adhering to that aspect. I know there are more \"casual\" observers of non-Christian religions, but I feel like converts can't/shouldn't do that. When people say you're a \"fake\" Christian for certain things, I roll my eyes. I feel like being a convert would mean constantly needing to prove myself and following everything. And in truth, I don't think I could follow every rule of any religion to the book. And I know many people who were born into certain religions who don't. I'm not saying I want to be a \"casual\" participant, but I believe sometimes we have personal beliefs that fall out of our religion that we shouldn't have to compromise.",

Keep in mind I’m an occasional smoker simply because it’s a very intense experience especially because I have a low tolerance. Anyway, after I took my couple puffs, I started to once again have this cascade of anxiety sweep over me with thoughts that basically put me in a corner with no escape.(I’m surprised this happened because alcohol usually lessens that overactive thinking). The kinds of thoughts that I was having had a kind of snake-like quality to them since they had to do with me rationalizing my position as a counter force against the biblical god. The next thing that inevitably takes place is me feeling as if I’m going to have a panic attack even though I’m aware that it’s just silly talk coming from an anxious brain. Now just to provide a little background, I’m a 22 year old male who lives with a Christian mother. Although she raised me secular until I turned 13. But by that point it was too late to convert me anyway. The whole thing I’m trying to get across here is that I’d like to smoke weed here and there and have that crazy intermission in life without having to deal with this existential crisis. I’m the type who gets off by thinking about a bunch of fundamental concepts, but I just hate how I have to run the risk of burying myself alive during my intoxicated states of mind.",

        "text": "I have wondered for a long while about our place in the universe, and literally everyone else at some point would've wondered -- why would they create religions and faiths in the first place? But what do you think about my beliefs?\n\nI do not want to assert any of my beliefs, yet it feels like they are absolutely true, so here goes. I ultimately believe that there is a higher power that isn't a god but rather a HYPER-NIGH-INFINITE intelligent civilisation that is responsible for creating our universe, if not a multiverse but we should just stick with our universe first. They are essentially our de facto gods that exist outside the universe, however, that doesn't necessarily mean I believe we are in a computerised simulation; heck, the centre of that civilisation could just be floating far outside the universe -- which I'd love to imagine as a massive sphere septillions of lightyears large -- without our universe simply existing as strings of code within a hyper-advanced mega computer. So, doesn't that automatically mean that I believe in INTELLIGENT DESIGN? Not at all. I believe in INTELLIGENTLY AUGMENTED PROBABILITY. The civilisation created the universe, by tweaking the numbers to ensure that some fine-tuned grounds were established, and modulated the probabilities of randomness so that after billions of years, very sparse islands of life scattered across the vast universe would form and flourish in very ideal and suitable settings. Those augmented probabilities allowed the first cellular organisms to form billions of years ago in the oceans until, billions of years later, one species would eventually evolve into an intelligent civilisation while all others would be subordinate/inferior: Homo Sapiens.\n\nThat is not a showcase of intelligent design but rather augmented probability. I mean just look at our solar system. There are several continents that seemingly arranged themselves into 7 after billions of years of tectonic activity right around the time of humankind with ideal settings for a multitude of civilisations to have risen. The moon, after being birthed from the fiery event that occurred billions of years prior, is like a milestone for our civilisation to reach, and after that would be the other vacant planets waiting to be occupied and colonised by us. From there, the ideally formed solar system shall ideally provide the resources necessary for our expansionist species to reach further and colonise the next preset milestone: Alpha Centauri. This process goes on and on, and this isn't exclusively what humanity is going through; countless other civilisations, gifted with preset locations, will have to face those challenges. So if this is all preplanned, then what is the universal purpose of this nigh-infinite civilisation's creation? To mature and progress because it is a TEST. A test to see which civilisation(s) will be able to mature into the universally transcendent civilisation our creators ARE. It's like raising a child until it matures enough to usurp and supersede the role of the parents. Likewise, they have preset conditions and starting locations for the countless civilisations along with challenges we must all overcome.\n\nPHASE I: Can the civilisation rise to become its host planet's dominant species? Will they succeed at this phase or destroy themselves?\n\nPHASE II: Can the civilisation attain the status of an extra-terrestrial one? Will they succeed at this phase or destroy themselves (humanity is obviously going to destroy itself rn lol)?\n\nPHASE III: Is the civilisation able to expand to conquer and colonise its host star system? Succeed or fail?\n\nPHASE IV: Is the civilisation competent enough to expand beyond its star system to other stellar systems? Succeed or fail?\n\nAfter those phases are surmounted come the next preplanned challenges: interactions with OTHER civilisations. By this point, across one's galaxy, in order for a species to continue expanding across the galaxy, it'd be pretty unlikely for said species to not encounter others along the way, and those tumultuous conditions would inadvertently catapult those challenges right into them. How will they deal with alien/foreign interactions? Will they cooperate or compete? Will they annihilate one another or work together to continue their expansionist ambitions throughout the whole galaxy? Will the weak be eliminated by civilisations much more potent and advanced than them? This process would basically continue even after the interstellar stages since it'd apply to intergalactic ones as well. It continues until one, if not a few of them, mature to become universe-level civilisations which is a level so advanced that it can begin to rival/challenge that of our creators, and that is the ultimate goal anyway. For the children to mature into adulthood and supersede the parents as rightful successors. In a way, regardless of whether our universe is truly material or one that exists as immaterial code within a hypercomputer, I suppose it is somewhat of a simulation... or a game... or an ultimate test for not just humanity but all other intelligent species within this astronomically sized sandbox. These creators do not provide an \"afterlife\" or any reward/punishment if any living organism were to perish; it is part of life. The creators of our universe are watching us as well as the quadrillions of other living creatures, seeing who shall mature into adulthood and replace them in the end.\n\nThe way I see it, we are not the centre of the universe, we are just one of the countless other intelligent civilisations that have to pass the challenges and phases of growing up in this intelligently AUGMENTED universe. We dominate our world, the nigh-infinite civilisation has given us a moon to land on as one of the first milestones of a young species, a solar system to colonise and a whole galaxy as an arena, full of other teams/species, to contend with, but we haven't even made it past PHASE II entirely. Again, I am not asserting that any of this may be true, maybe I'm just crazy, but maybe this is why everything exists. From the Big Bang to now. I could be right, I could be wrong. I don't see design in this universe, I see PURPOSE. If I am wrong, then this may just be another reddit $h1tpost, but if I'm right about this universe, then we should be obligated to maintain peace in the CIVILISATION OF HUMANKIND because if we don't, then we will kill ourselves with our sticks and stones, and our creators will surely be disappointed we couldn't make it to PHASE III.\n\nIf we are being tested by our creators, then let us show them that we can make it past those phases by preserving world peace for the sake of continuing our civilisation's growth and empowerment... but then again it's equally plausible that I'm just as insane as Christian propagandists.

        "text": "My sister's fiancee's father just suddenly died out of the blue today, seriously. I would ask my sister's fiancee about this, but honestly now would probably not be the best time for obvious reasons.\n\nNow, to be clear, whether or not this guy is technically a Samaritan is a bit dubious. He claims that his father was one, but his mother is Christian. When he got into his teen years, he decided he'd rather follow his father's religion. Either way, he does possess a number of unorthodox beliefs (no pun intended). He normally goes around telling people he's Jewish, but when my sister tried to interview him for a religion class, he confessed he was actually Samaritan and only told people he was Jewish so he wouldn't have to explain to everyone what he actually was. This prompted me once to ask him if he actually saw himself as Jewish or not. He started off by describing his religion as 'intermediate between Christianity and Judaism', which obviously wasn't a comment I was expecting from a guy who normally goes around telling people he's a Jew. I don't think he really said much, though he does believe in evolution, and even boasted once about getting involved in a creationism debate with a preacher in a church. Most strangely though he seriously has a crucifix tattoo on his chest, and even has a picture of Jesus in his house. Seriously. Oh, and he believes in the Illuminati thing too, lovely. Asking about his beliefs in here years ago, I got a bunch of Jews telling me that he was a heretic. \n\nHeretic or not, he's not a religion I'm familiar with so I don't know what he might believe, and as stated I can't just go and ask him right now. I know what Christians believe (I was raised one), but I have no clue what a Samaritan might. \n\nWhat are their beliefs on the afterlife? Do they believe in a heaven, sheol, something else? I've read they do believe in a great resurrection at some point in the future. More importantly though, I'd like to know about funerary practices. My mother claims Jews don't support embalming, so the funeral may be held rather quickly, but she also likes to watch a bunch of conspiracy stuff on youtube so who knows if that's true or not. Of course, I don't know if me and my mother will be attending; he isn't technically a relative, and we never even knew this man. I've only seen him once or twice, and I literally can't remember hearing him speak. I wouldn't know what his own religious beliefs were, other than that his son claims he was Samaritan. Besides, my own family has had an excessive number of deaths over the past 6 years. The last funeral I went to, I was seriously starting to get sick of going to funerals. And just a few months ago this quasi-Samaritan and his brother helped me bury one of our dogs that died after a year-long illness (she was given six months to live, but didn't start to decline till nearly a year later). Oh, and my sister's dog died just months before that I think. Yeah, fun times. My mother's openly not too keen on going to another funeral anyway. Honestly though, since we obviously aren't family or the same religion, I don't know if we would even be allowed to attend. We haven't been able to discuss the matter, due to all the chaos that followed this man's death. Me and my mother have yet to even find out how this man died. We never heard anything about him being sick. I suspect there was either an accident or he was murdered by one of the alt-righters in town. No word yet on what really happened though. Right now, all we know is that quasi-Samaritan's father just died, and that's it. \n\nCan anyone offer any help as to what may transpire next, or what my sister's fiancee may believe? Keep in mind, he was raised by a supposedly Samaritan father and a Christian mother, so his believes may be a mixture of those two religions.",

If a man's intellect overcomes his desires, he is greater then the angels. If a man's desire overcomes his intellect, he us worse then an animal. \n\nI couldn't find the comment I saw this in but I thought it has some truth in it and it provoced a lot of thoughts I felt uncomfortable with. And tried to figure out why. Then I finally realized that a man's (or woman's) desire sometimes should overcome their intellect. I'll give you an example. If I see someone that is extremely cunning. Then that someone really convinces my intellect that I need to listen to him. But my desire is to take my 2 legs and go. Another example - if I am being tought that all jews are enemies so they give me a gun. Then I pull out that gun and I see kids and people smiling and feel a strong desire to spare those people's lives but my intellect knows that I will be a shahid if I do it and will be doing good but my desire really wants to just, cry. Compassion, courrage. All need some heart. Some desires are not sins from the flesh. Some desires are from the heart. I am not saying that we should ignore our intellect and only listen to our heart because that's the definition of being a fool (believe me I know what it's like). But the other way around is also not right. I am sure the god of Islam is not the intellect and there are probably other paragraphs about courrage and compassion. And intuition and emotion all other components of being human other then intellect and desires.",

        "text": "this happened a few days ago while i was at work. i work retail btw. i basically just have to stand inside this circular table thingy all day and speak to customers \n\nthe first incident happened at around 1-2pm. we had just opened our store so we weren’t very busy and there were hardly any customers. i’m not allowed to use my phone so i just stare into space when nobody is there. that’s what i was doing when out of nowhere, i saw a small black figure on all fours covered in spikes look at me and then run underneath the table i was standing at. it didn’t have eyes but i could tell that it was looking at me because i saw its body twist upwards in a strange way. i’m sorry i can’t explain it better \n\nat first i thought it was a dog for some reason, since one of my coworkers has a black dog that she brings into work for some reason, but i hadn’t seen her all day. i leaned over the table to see where it went and it had disappeared. i didn’t feel scared by it, i could tell it was demonic, but it didn’t  feel evil or like it was there to torture me \n\nthe next incident happened at 9pm. my manager (a close family friend) was driving me home because we live on the same road, not even a minute away from each other. it was dark and he stopped at a red light. i looked out the window and a figure, about 7 or 8 feet tall, that looked like a mannequin walking very slowly towards the car. \n\nit was really skinny but had no detail on its body. it had no hands or feet, no face, no hair, i couldn’t even see any bones sticking out like you can with some people. but it’s body was made of skin. it was like a mannequin with skin if that makes any sense. i hope i explain that well\n\nmy manager asked me what i was looking at because we were having a conversation before this happened and i went silent without meaning to. i told him exactly what i saw and he just laughed at me thinking that i was joking which pissed me off \n\ni didn’t feel alarmed or scared by its presence. i could tell it was evil and demonic but we were a safe enough distance that i could just observe it without feeling threatened. it was strange though, almost every other demonic entity that has harassed me has been some form of shadow creature but this one was the most human looking i’ve ever seen  \n\nsorry if you’re lying or you think i’m joking, i promise i’m not",

Every sin you commit would have predetermined, You did not commit the sin out of your free will.\n\nHow come God can judge people in a test he already knows the result of? Why would He even bother doing that?\n\nAn example would be taking a test in a class, your teacher decides before the exam that you are going to fail and another student is going to pass, doesn’t seem fair does it?\n\nIf you have free will and god is testing you since he doesn’t know the result, that in turn means that he is neither all knowing nor all powerful since he cant predict the outcome of your life.\n\nHowever if he is all knowing and all powerful, then has no right to judge you for a life that he planned out for you, wether it be for failure or success.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/religion/comments/ztz3kb/am_i_the_only_one_who_feels_that_theosis_henosis/",
        "text": "Am I the only one who feels that theosis/henosis/moksha/nirvana, etc. in Christianity (especially Orthodoxy), Neoplatonism, Hinduism (especially Advaita Vedanta), Gnosticism, and Buddhism is a perversion, unnatural, unhealthy, and so forth?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTheosis is the process (typically expressed in three stages) of unification with God (understood here as an ineffable origin of everything); henosis is the dissolution of the individual into the Divine (also expressed by Plotinus in similar stages); *moksha*, as I understood, is where the individual consciousness, *Atman*, dissolves into the Divine, *Brahman*; and *nirvana* I assume is a similar idea. This is typically achieved by a lifelong process of denying worldly pleasures, denying the self, praying or meditating, and possibly even solitude, such as in a cave or in a hut on a mountain. This is known as *asceticism*. The denial of worldly pleasures entails such things as: detaching value from material things (food, drink, gold, women, social status) or trying to simplify one's tastes--oddly, a detached attitude to music and art is not included here; fasting; it could even include cold showers, I don't know, but it would fit the general narrative; and even with some Catholics, for example, 'mortification' of the flesh (whipping yourself, making yourself bleed); and, yet more extreme, 'self-mummification' with some buddhists; or that Hindu man who has spent his life pointing with one arm to heaven such that the muscles in his arm barely exist anymore. This is not so much a test of the believer's will, as a process of *detaching* the believer from earthly existence so that their attention can go towards God/Brahman/whatever-you-want-to-call-it. In some strands of Christianity it is said that the Devil rules this world, perhaps since 'the Fall', and that is why it is flawed. In Neoplationism, at least, Plotinus says that we were once one with the *the One* (the Divine) and that we have since degenerated from this oneness into diversity, individuality. If the wikipedia page is anything to go by, Plotinus distrusted or hated this world and the flesh. He would permit no portrait of him because of it. Plotinus believed we should free ourselves of thought, enter into pure consciousness; essentially, that we should meditate. In Gnosticism it is said that this world was created by the 'Demiurge', an evil demigod-style character; and we, the spirits, have become trapped within it and so have to return to the Divine, who exists beyond the Demiurge. In Hinduism this world is said to be one of *maya*, illusion. The Hindus and Buddhists teach that this world is one of suffering (not entirely untrue) and that when we die we are reincarnated (*samsara*) into new life; how virtuous we were in our past life, you could say, determines what we will be reborn into. For Hindus and Buddhists this rebirth-cycle is seen as torturous and something to be escaped from by spiritual improvement in each life until you escape the cycle and unite with the Brahman or enter nirvana. And Buddhism as you know advocates meditation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe goal here is 'ego-death'--which is possibly also something Jung discussed? I am not sure Jung was ever into asceticism though; he certainly didn't seem like one. As far as I can tell the ego is the you that has personality traits, family, a country, hobbies, interests, virtues, vices; it's everything of you other than your pure consciousness. (Hinduism has words for all these things, moreorless.) The ego has to die so that the 'purer', 'truer', 'higher' part of your self can 'return' to God/Brahman/etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo as far as I can see, ascetics of all religions have a massive amount in common. Their semantics and exact theologies and exact practices will differ, but their practices and endgoal goal seem to me, an outsider, to be moreorless the same. In fact, I would say that the ascetics of the different religions have more in common with each other than they do with their supposed coreligionists. Mystical Christianity, for example, it seems to me is far from the Catholic Christianity I was ever raised with, or the American protestant Christianity that you hear about all the time. There's no fluffy heaven, and if God loves you, it's in a way that is a bit more like the Borg in Star Trek than how your grandad used to hug you when you were young.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow the intellectual in me has been, shall we say, *fascinated* in this idea of theosis on and off for a while. But the human being in me revolts. I just don't see how this is practical, desirable, moral. Honestly, this sounds like the philosophy of depression, of suicide. If we are to picture the endgame for the ascetic, as far as I can tell it is not distinguishable at all from death. You have removed almost all of earthly existence, and for all intents and purposes the person who is truly 'ascended' is dead. The most committed ascetics it seems are the ones who could die and you wouldn't even notice. Maybe those are the extremes, but you get the point. As far as I understand it, the goal here is to unite with or dissolve in the *cosmic goo*\\--God, Brahman, the One, call it whatever you like. And I just don't see how this is healthy or desirable at all? It really does sound like the philosophy of a depressed person. It is no wonder I have read some spiritual people trying to spin depression as some kind of step in the direction of enlightenment. Yea, sure, you'll clean out your house and let God in...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is the point in being born into this world with flowers and human beings and family and friends and good food, and yes horrible suffering, if we're just going to throw it all away and engage in a system reset? That is basically how Plotinus describes it: 'We f\\*cked up. Let's go back again.'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHonestly, might I suggest--just an idea I have had--that a contrary idea of aspiring to be like a (pagan) god of your choosing (by being virtuous, driven, etc.) might be a healthier alternative as a kind of meta spiritual path, a teleology or whatever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf someone wants to be a hermit, if they really are that introverted or have been that hurt by other people: be my guest! If you wish to live like Radagast the Brown among the birds in the woods--which is a supplement for human company, so not exactly *theosis*\\--, then why not? But such people are not trying to die before they die, are they? That is why I think for some extreme introverts that might be the healthy thing to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy issue is with this whole hating the world, hating the human, wanting to die without die and pretty much get  absorbed into the divine Borg. You might as well have never been born if this is honestly what tickles your pickle--indeed, tickling your pickle would be too worldly a sensation for your liking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnybody agree? Anybody disagree? Why?",

        "text": "I think it's fair to say that many people here are familiar with the telling of the \"First Christmas\" in the Holy Bible, certainly most Christians here are. Luke 2 is perhaps the most illuminating and descriptive in the telling of the event - the story of Mary and Joseph, angels proclaiming good tidings of great joy, and of course the birth of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God. \n\nWhat many people may not be aware of is the fact that the First Christmas is also detailed in ***The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ*** from the perspective of the peoples in that book who, as Latter-day Saints believe, inhabited the ancient Americas. As a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I thought I would simply share the story of the First Christmas as it appears in the Book of Mormon for anyone interested.\n\nThe Book of Mormon refers to the miraculous birth of Jesus in numerous places and passages - **1 Nephi 10:4** says that \"a prophet would the Lord God raise up among the Jews—even a Messiah, or, in other words, a Savior of the world.\" **Mosiah 3:8** clarifies \"And he shall be called Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Father of heaven and earth, the Creator of all things from the beginning; and his mother shall be called Mary.\" But the true telling of the Christmas story comes towards the end of the book, in the books of **Helaman** and **3 Nephi**.\n\nAbout ten years before the birth of Christ, a prophet known as “Samuel the Lamanite” proclaimed the coming forth of the Savior to the Book of Mormon peoples, saying that many miracles and wonders would be performed in the years leading up to his birth. When ten years passed, and the miracles and wonders indeed began occurring with great frequency, some began to question whether the supposed date prophesied by Samuel had passed, while others began outright claiming that there would be no birth of a “Savior”.\n\nBelievers started facing mockery and persecution for their faith in God and their continued belief in the words which Samuel the Lamanite had preached to them. Indeed, those who were involved in said persecution had plans in place to begin putting all believers to death.\n\nOne evening, a man named Nephi knelt in prayer, distraught over the persecutions his people were facing and ”cried mightily to his God”. In response to Nephi’s cries, the spirit of Jehovah appeared to him, and said,\n\n“**Lift up your head and be of good cheer**; for behold, the time is at hand, and on this night shall the sign be given, and **on the morrow come I into the world**, to show unto the world that I will fulfil all that which I have caused to be spoken by the mouth of my holy prophets.\n\nBehold, **I come unto my own, to fulfil all things which I have made known unto the children of men from the foundation of the world**, and to do the will, both of the Father and of the Son—of the Father because of me, and of the Son because of my flesh. And behold, the time is at hand, and this night shall the sign be given.\n\nAnd it came to pass that the words which came unto Nephi were fulfilled, according as they had been spoken; for behold, at the going down of the sun there was no darkness; and the people began to be astonished because there was no darkness when the night came.” - 3 Nephi 1:13-15\n\nThis sign was comprised of two parts, the first being the Biblical one found in **Matthew 2:2**, his star in the east which was seen by the Wise Men. This same star was also seen as a sign by the Nephites and the Lamanites in the Book of Mormon according to **3 Nephi 1:21**. The second part of the sign was that, \"at the going down of the sun t**here was no darkness**; and the people began to be astonished because **there was no darkness when the night came**... ...And it came to pass that **there was no darkness in all that night, but it was as light as though it was mid-day**. And it came to pass that the sun did rise in the morning again, according to its proper order; **and they knew that it was the day that the Lord should be born**, because of the sign which had been given. \" - **3 Nephi 1:15;19**.\n\nTruly, the story of the First Christmas as told in the Bible is beautiful as it gives the clearest and most eloquent description of the birth of Jesus Christ. But I believe the story of Christ's birth as it was experienced by the Book of Mormon peoples is likewise a beautiful story that helps me to grow my faith and appreciate the meaning behind the Christmas season.",

Even though I had given a background clean Criminal/Security security check as I had a couple of extras from when I also needed to give A.H.S a copy, I wasn't allowed downstairs to help volunteer with anyone. This problem despite knowing that people were allowed to volunteer with the youth which and I have absolutely no clue if any of the past or present volunteers have given one themselves to the administration despite the fact many stories personal tensions between members who joined before, during, and after I had become a member had supposed escalated relations to the point the court got involved. \n\n[The Owl Program](https://www.uua.org/re/owl), a supposed youth sexuality program, had ran for a year in which I felt rather strange they needed a member of the congregation who had openly admitted to still getting traffic violations and was still allowed to drink during suppers as many members had been allowed to bring their own alcohol.  Her daughters religious training had been funded by the congregation which is probably why they allowed her to do volunteer with the youth for as long as she did up till she and her husband supposedly been removed from the church for some strange reason.  Her daughter did her one year practicum elsewhere in Canada. BC if I remember. This owl program costed $500 or more during that year, I am unsure weather or not if it was per class or for the full year. But the last Sunday service of the year was held a youth Graduation Ceremony and were given mini diplomas. Eventually sent a letter of concern over this since I wasn't getting any realistic response as to why someone who's a self proclaimed highschool dropout and still supposedly still accrued traffic citations for infringements' the church kept a secret. I grew up being informed only a trained professional and one who's not just academically certified but also has proven they've paid yearly to practice health standards in youth sexuality. Or at least that's what schools used did that I'm aware of. Not just pick any random person out of congregation or even off the street. \n\nWhen I worked for 4th Street Wine and Liquor, we were forced to have a training certificate even as a cashier as the [AGLC](https://aglc.ca/) had been for years doing their part to finding ways to impose charges to minors and individuals whos bodies were still processing medication or other drugs. And I had been informed the AGLC made anyone dealing with Alcohol and Gambling to have specific licenses. Even when it comes to the consumption of alcohol on a certain premises which I barely remember ever seeing. I have brought this up a couple of times without any kind of response on the churches side.",

        "text": "Many of us consider ourselves to be spiritual, when we are actually religious. Religion, we must understand, is the kindergarten to spirituality. Spirituality is beyond religion. There are many religions, each advocating and propagating different Gods and beliefs, but there are no ‘different kinds of spirituality’. Spirituality is just one — it advocates the ultimate truth. Spirituality is the science of the Spirit, the Soul, the Atman. It leads us to self-realization and God-realization, the ultimate goal of life.\n\nReligion is an organized way of praying to a God or several Gods. Each religion has its own rituals, beliefs, even myths and superstitions. The God that most religions believe in is a God with a name and form. Religions have created thousands of Gods. But spirituality believes in one God — a God that is formless and nameless, endless and beginningless. According to spirituality, God is never born, God never dies. God is not a person or a saint but a power—a power that is omnipresent, omniscient, and omnipotent. God is the Supreme Immortal Power. God is everywhere, in everything. Everything is a manifestation of the Divine. Only God is, there is nothing else. The Supreme Immortal Power is in every molecule of matter and in every being. Whether animate or inanimate — everything is God.\n\nReligion means well. It is not that religion is bad. Religion introduces God to us. It encourages us to have faith, belief in the Divine. Hence, as children, religion begins our journey to God. But finally, it is spirituality that concludes our journey to God. We cannot attain God without religion, just as we cannot attain God with religion. Religion helps us connect with God, but then it confuses us with rituals and dogmas. It limits our comprehension of God by making God appear as a human being. And we go round and round in circles after that unable to exercise our intellect, unable to discriminate and arrive at a conclusion. Religion makes us see God as someone different from us, as someone who lives in a temple or in a heaven. Spirituality, on the other hand, helps us realize that God is within us. God lives in the temple of our heart. Even our scriptures say the same thing — the kingdom of God is within us. The Four Mahavakyas from the Upanishads clearly state this fact: Tat Twam Asi; Ayam Atma Brahma; Prajnanam Brahma; Aham Brahmasmi. But we don’t interpret scriptures correctly. Therefore, just as we move on from kindergarten and finally go to a university to graduate, we have to go and grow from religion to spirituality. It is spirituality that will take us to the ultimate goal of life — of Enlightenment, self-realization, God-realization, Moksha, Nirvana. Unfortunately, religion has created differences amongst people. It has divided people because each religion claims that its God is the only true God. People become fanatics and start hating other people. If we all turn to spirituality, we will be united because we will realize that we are all one, we are not different from each other. Spirituality is the way to love, peace and joy, to universal brotherhood.",

Me and my boyfriend were going through some sort of ritual in order to be recognized as a couple in that cycle. My boyfriend was clothed in a sort of garment similar to those traditional to Central Asia and the Middle East: saggy pants, with a strip of cloth above, making it seem like a skirt sometimes. A belt made by strung fabric, and a long sleeved shirt. All were of the same material and of the same color, I think some shade of pale blue or violet. He was also given a round, tight-fitting cap made with a richly embroidered fabric. Its rim had two holes on the front, surrounded by a layer of metal.\n\nThe garment seemed to be something associated to the ritual he was being prepared to, but not the cap. That seemed to just be something used by males in that religion. \n\nOne of the men accompanying him to the ceremony started explaining to us about it. The ceremony's name ended with an 'iz', to which I asked if it was Turkic and to which he replied yes. We continued walking and arrived at an elevated platform. On the left side there was what seemed to be some sort of temple, seemingly somewhat Chinese or Japanese, with the front wall made of bars. The men guided my boyfriend alongside the corridor in its front, and the ritual was initiated. The girl tanned long haired girl seated on the other side of the bars stripped her chest, and then I think music started playing, and men clad in Japanese hakamas started dancing or fighting.\n\nThe music was produced by some sort of stringed instrument, and was fairly repetitive. I don't think it was produced from a bowed instrument like an enhu, and its sound was not as sharp as a shamisen's. \n\nThere were two people with skins painted black, clad with many neck, arm and ear ornaments, both on all fours and below the platform, each on one extremity. Once the ritual initiated they started crawling towards us according to the music, in a very paced way (which makes me think there were drums at this point). Everytime they paced ahead everyone that had accompanied us stepped back, but in a very controlled way, in the sense I felt like that was just one part of the ritual everyone was already acquainted with. But the music got quicker, and the two people started approaching quicker and everyone started running, and I feel that the two people started running too, chasing us, but I couldn't see because I didn't look back, just ran as fast as I could. And that's when I woke up.\n\nI feel like there were other Japanese elements besides the people with hakamas, and I feel like there were other Chinese elements too. For some context, I am well acquainted with traditional Japanese culture. I know a bit of Chinese, but only through my contact with Japanese. My knowledge of Turkic people's is honestly very meager.",

Matters of spirit matter more than things the world considers valuable education and wisdom.   I'm not off putting conventional education, I'm a Carnegie Mellon Computer Science and Physics graduate who does research work.  I'm just saying, value your spiritual education even more.  For in God, our provider, there is life more abundant.  God made all of Creation out of nothing, he blooms glory in our lives as we trust in him over trying to be selfish and controlling to our fellow man.  We gotta all be helping and uplifting one another.  Ya all know this.\n\nSince most people are uneducated, it saddens me that so many people are vocal about their lack of knowledge.  It seems the less people know, the more loud and sure they are about what they think they know whether it is true or not.  This is not a new phenomena, it's part of the fallen nature of man.  ( Simpsons did it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dccWrg2VtYk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dccWrg2VtYk) ) The first 9 seasons of Simpsons is not respected by all Christians, but it should be as the very first episode of a Christmas special and it delves into what it means to be human and do the right thing by foiling it against not doing it. ;)  In my book the Supernatural Bedroom, I do cover the gamut of the mistakes of allowing your children to be exposed to all culture or none at all.  The former leads to degeneracy. The later leads to rebellion against the faith.\n\nYou don't see a lot of people brave enough to write books on sex blessed by God Almighty. I take sex as a very private affair and never wanted to talk about it.  But CNN started blasting lies about Christian sex being dry and boring(what else is new, everyone sees em lying these days).  CNN's lies are nothing further from the truth.  \n\nAbraham's wife was so ridiculously attractive, that he was afraid of being murdered by kings when he traveled.  When you read the beginning of the Bible, you see all the boring begets. Those begets were not boring to those be-getting it on.  God crafted us as clay, and we will not remain clay forever, but get a glorious ascended new body in Heaven so even our bodies changing is fine when it is God that does the changing.  You cannot feel another person's pleasure or pain, and what you think is the best pleasure may not be even remotely close to the heights of pleasure and joy that God wants for you.  This is fact, your best pleasure might not even be remotely as much as others feel.  Man compares himself with the physical, what he can touch and see, but the spiritual is so much more important.\n\nTo gain God's favor, you need to let go of the things you THINK would give you long term pleasure: hoarding money, sleeping with people any chance you get, putting yolk of control on your fellow man, the illusion of buying love, and other corruptions.  God is more eastern of a religion than eastern religions because Jesus is teaching us that in order to gain what matters, we must release the hold on things we think help us.  Instead we must help others then God will help us.  Seek to serve everyone you can.  Help the poor.  Feed the hungry.  Cure the sick.  Live a life where you build yourself up and those around you up, not a life of self destruction that leads to dragging those around you down.  Now say you have had an Appetite for Destruction in the past and you're a dredge now, just ask Jesus for forgiveness and you can rule with the King of Kings and see glory and pleasure beyond your dreams for certain... The thing is we're all dredges, just some of us are too prideful to admit it.  Those of us with even the slightest clue will see our pursuit of sex can get weird if not focused on the holy and God... In someway or another, we're all broken and depraved people.  We all need Jesus Christ as a savior... Most people get this...  What most people don't get is really how high of joys and pleasure you really do get undeservedly rewarded for when you choose to walk with God through his son Jesus Christ.  People don't get it, because people are not educated these days in worldly education let alone the spiritual education.  Get educated, Get Pleasure, Get Got, Get Prayers answered, and know you can pray for your spouse or be praying for what you want in your future spouse if you don't have one.  Yes, you're allowed to pray for everything you're looking for in your future spouse. Prayer gets answered when you walk with Jesus and live to help everyone instead of living to use/abuse everyone to get your own ends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can even read for free if you have Kindle:\n\n \n\nGod enhances pleasure in sex with powers far greater than a #genie, #magician, #devil or #idol.  \nGet it! https://www.amazon.com/Supernatural-Bedroom-Power-Christian-Intimacy-ebook/dp/B08468Q8GW  \nGodly#Sex slandered by CNN so I stood up for the God of Love being the God of Lovemaking.  \nGod granted Abraham a wife so sexy attractive in Sarah he was afraid of kings.",

Now, I get most films are fiction and all, but I wonder where this archetype came from and why is it so popular in media? I've seen it even in Christian films!\n\nIn real life I've seen more examples of the opposite: people who turn to God when their lives go to hell. It also seems that countries that even were atheistic, such as former Soviet republics, often turned to religion after huge war or crisis. Although I get there are some exceptions, it is no secret Orthodox Church is almost a government branch in many of those Slavic countries at this point.\n\nOn the other hand, I rarely see people really annoyed at God because they assume God knows more than them (which is a reasonable assumption if you believe God is all-knowing), but I do observe them annoyed with religious authorities and religious friends that often did not help them as much as they expected.\n\nIf anything, it seems God becomes a form of comfort and coping for some people during a crisis, rather than a punchbag, although both approaches are kind of therapeutic. I also suppose many people who \"lose\" their faith after a crisis were often not religious in the first place, and God was rather a tradition rather than a active personal spiritual life.\n\nPersonally, I believe that if you love God you will love him regardless of if you are living a good life or a bad life, but I understand not everyone's experience is the same.\n\nMaybe these observations are limited to the state I live on, and the experience shown in films is far more commmon.

        "text": "Hi there! I was just wondering about a lingering thought that's always been in my head about religion in general. For context I'm 16 this year, born Muslim, but have just about renounced myself from the religion (if it weren't for my parents forcing it upon me). \n\n\nOne of my biggest gripes with (abrahamic) religions comes from the central idea of worshipping god. If you don't worship god, no matter how good you are, you still go to hell (at least in Islam). This really...erm...irked me? It seems super (for a lack of a better word) egotistical. I really, truly do not understand why a \"Supreme Divinity\" or \"all-powerful god\" as portrayed in these religions would genuinely want us humans to worship them, much less condemn us to eternal punishment if we do otherwise. \n\n\nWhy would they need worship? And why would they punish us for not worshipping them? It seems needlessly cruel and selfish. \n\n\nI mean, when you play the Sims, is your first instinct to get the Sims to pray to and revere you? Uh, for most people, I'd think no. \n\n\nI dunno. The whole concept seems a little fishy to me. I personally don't think God would/should need or desire worship. \n\n\nIt could be argued that in worshipping god and following the religion, it serves as a 'guide' to morality that keeps us in check from doing wrong. If we worship god and follow his principles, then we cannot be evil people. This explanation sort of makes sense, but can't really apply anymore in today's society, when laws and enforcement exist to do exactly that. The average atheist is probably just as 'good' or 'evil' as the average Christian/Muslim/Jew/etc. So this argument doesn't really hold up for me. \n\n\nThe idea of worshiping a god that demands to be worshipped just seems super off-putting, and is a big contributor as to why I cannot bring myself to accept Islam's teaching and beliefs (on top of things like inherent anti-homosexuality and the likes).",

        "text": "I was raised Christian but enjoy reading eastern philosophies like Kriya Yoga, Ramana Maharshi, Osho, Mingyur Rinpoche, Dogen... It seems like East spiritual traditions agree with Christianity in key ways that are helpful for Christians to explore their connection with God and Jesus deeper than short prayers, limiting scriptural study to exclude Eastern sages, and no meditation or other technical work on consciousness. \n\nPlease let me know your thoughts on these questions.\n\nIs Jesus the only person who has been a divine being, Son of God, or God Itself if that is your faith, or who are some others?\n\nFor those who says Jesus is the only divine person, why haven't there been others, and is it possible there have been others that we don't know about?\n\nFor those who say \"only Jesus\" because He alone satisfied prophesies, wouldn't Jesus still be as profound/telepathic/divine in, for example, seeing the entire life of others like the woman at the well if He hadn't? \n\nIt isn't satisfying prophesies that answers the question \"Was Jesus correct in saying He was God's begotten Son or a lunatic?\" It's His story and truth that goes beyond His words, isnt it? The last shall be first and first shall be last, as all Christians know, and Jesus was poor, mocked, and ultimately killed for His message, so far last that His \"life\" was taken from Him. And yet, He was first. \n\nAnyone who shows you Jesus's peace beyond all understanding is doing the thing that Christians take as proof that Jesus was who He said He was, right? If it could be done that a person demonstrated super human gifts like Jesus did, a Christian would have to say this other person is by definition as divine or equal in superiority over the rest of humanity as Jesus, right?\n\nOr consider a different approach, if Jesus met all the prophesies but made moronic statements, any intelligent person would have to dismiss Him as \"special\" but stupid, maybe even subhuman. So the key ingredient to being like Jesus in the way that makes Jesus special to Christians is to develop His moral awareness for oneself to the point of genuinely caring/giving a damn about/wanting the best for others as if humanity were all a single organism of which each of us is merely analogous to finger, organ, or cell of the larger body or consciousness. Isn't this consistent with what Christians believe, or why not?",

I have to add that although this \"church\" is racist, they are not activist or physically violent.\n\nThe building of the congregation seems to be from a defunct Baptist Church, but it seems weird Neo-Pagans use the term \"Church\" which is heavily associated with Christianity, while in other aspects they do want to distance themselves from by using other terms for stuff such as festivities and rituals. I wonder why the world Church is an exception.\n\nIs that a strategy to avoid social backlash? Maybe a way to re-purpose some Christian terms? Or just habit?",
