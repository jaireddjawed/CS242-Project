I'm halfway through the first book in the series, *Leviathan Wakes*, and I absolutely love it.\n\nExcept. . .\n\nThe only word the writers seem to know is \"said.\" Everything is said. Nothing is asked or shouted or muttered or whispered or implied or stated matter of factly or purported or guessed. When two people are talking back and forth, no one ever replies or responds or shoots back or interrupts or reassures or challenges or agrees. It's just said said said said said said said from the top left corner down to the lower right.\n\nThe book is otherwise great. The world building and hard sci-fi elements are fantastic. The world and society feel real and plausible, nothing is conveniently hand-waved away, everything happens for a believable reason. But the word \"said\" is starting to infect my brain like the sound of someone chewing with their mouth open. It's all I can hear now, no matter how hard I try to ignore it. \n\nDid this book not have an editor? Someone to circle the word \"said\" in the middle of a question and write \"asked?\" in the margin nearby? My sophomore high school English teacher wouldn't have let me get away with this in a two page short story. \n\nWhat are some other examples out there? Books that maybe aren't \"ruined\" by some beginner mistake,  but where the beginner mistakes really stand out because of the stark contrast with the otherwise quality writing?",

        "text": "I read genre fiction, guilty as charged.  Sometimes finishing a series brings a sense of satisfaction. Other times a sense of profound loss, characters who have become familiar, like friends or family are gone, their journey ended.  I finished three series last year that left me feeling...abandoned I guess?  \n\n\nThe Honor Harrington books by David Weber.  Admittedly, I didn't like Uncompromising Honor much at all.  For the Star Kingdom the war had become just so easy.  The danger was gone. They were going to win, it was all over except the dying. I wish the series had ended differently.  I'll still re-read and enjoy much of the series, but not the ending of it.  A Short Victorious War is still my favorite.  \n\n\nThe Felix Castor books by Mike Carey.  What do you mean it's over? There have been rumors of a 6th book, but I don't think it will ever happen.  Mike said that while the series was a modest success, sales just didn't warrant the time for a sixth book.  The Naming of the Beasts wrapped things up well, I just wish there had been one more.  Every single one of the Castor books was like reading a punch to the gut at the denouement.  I've never reacted so viscerally to detective fiction of any sort.  They are amazing.  \n\n\nDresden Files. Oh how I love these.  They might be trashed here and there, but I love them, start to finish, every one.  When I wrote my novel, it was because I wanted to write like Jim Butcher.  Harry Dresden lived in my head and his exploits were hugely influential.  When I finished Battle Ground I was exhausted.  It's one long action sequence.  I was mad, if you've read it, you know why.  And I was very sad because it was over and I didn't want it to be. Harry, Bob, Molly, Ebenezer, Butters, Michael, and everyone else were done.  There were no more stories to tell. And that makes me sad.  My friends are still in there between their digital Kindle covers, waiting for me to come visit but the story has been told. I just hope Harry's life turned out okay afterward.\n\nWhat did you finish that left you like these did for me?",

        "text": "Wow…\n\nSo, this is my FIL’s favorite author and series. The combination of his enthusiasm for the books and the constant recommendations I see for it online forced my hand—so I dove right in. And I was *not* disappointed.\n\nI started the books with the understanding that they are purposefully written without much explicit exposition and that I was meant to feel lost at times. Honestly, I feel as though that sentiment was a bit dramatized as if I were being over cautioned. I certainly felt like I was flung in medias res into the world but I wasn’t ever truly confused about what I was reading.\n\nThere were plenty of mysteries and I had to figure them out on my own. Sometimes it took a few chapters before I began to understand what things were; Warrens, for example. But for the most part, anything that I didn’t understand felt purposeful. And I appreciated it because it helped me empathize with the characters and their own misguided understandings of the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Writing**\n\nI love Steven Erikson’s writing. From the prose itself to his way of telling his story. I’ve never read a book with so many POVs and I went into this thinking I would have difficulty keeping track of everyone; however, I don’t recall once feeling like I didn’t get enough of any particular character, being confused about which POV I was reading, or forgetting who a character was… and there were a lot of them. I think part of this is because each POV is very short when compared to other books and most chapters involved most of the POV cast.\n\nThen there is the effect his writing has on the world building and development of characters. Steven Erikson does not hold your hand in this book. He gives you everything you need to figure out the world, its magic, and its politics—at least what is meant to be understood—but it is not given to you freely. You *have* to figure it out yourself. Sometimes the clues are hidden and don’t become apparent until later. Sometimes they are revealed casually, through passing words or subtle actions.\n\nSometimes you’re forced to read between the lines and figure out what the absolute fuck is happening. The characters know. The author knows. I *think* our Lord and savior Jesus Christ knows. But no one is going to clue you in. And why should they? You’re an outsider to the world, dropped into the midst of a war, and the books reads like you’re not owed an explanation. But it gives all the pieces needed to make your own conclusions and as you read, you gather together more and more until the picture is completed… mostly.\n\nI never felt confused in any way other than how I would putting together a 1000-piece puzzle. As long as I kept moving along, putting things that didn’t yet make sense into the back of my mind, saving them for later until their place in the story became apparent, I didn’t feel lost.\n\nFor me the writing, the story, and the world was about enjoying the journey to understanding.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Characters**\n\nThis was very much a character driven story. Driven by the characters’ regrets, insecurities, and triumphs. The world reacted to the characters and the characters to the world. I really wish I got more time with all the characters but with something like 25 POVs in this book (Idk… I’m not going to actually count, pfft), there wasn’t enough time.\n\nHowever, I don’t think the characters were underdeveloped because of this. Instead, like the world’s mysteries themselves, it is left to the reader to delve into the minds of the characters. Though, unlike the lack of explicit exposition for the world, we *do* get to read and understand each character’s thoughts but it is still up to us to digest the implications of their actions, fill in their pasts, and empathize with their traumas.\n\nOn the topic of empathy, Steven Erikson portrays these characters in a neutral light. It is made obvious to the reader that the actions taken by some are evil in nature but he doesn’t remove the humanness from them. And he doesn’t tell you how to feel about them. At least, not explicitly.\n\nFor example, Adjunct Lorn is a character who &gt;!unleashes a Jaghut Tyrant on the world!&lt; at the orders of Empress Laseen. She is obviously someone who is on the wrong side of good and evil—as far as our current understanding of the world in this book leads us to believe—but we still get to see the human side of her and her struggles with her identity as Lorn, the woman, and her identity as Lorn, Adjunct to the Empress. They are at odds with each other and she is ultimately a victim of circumstance.\n\nMy favorite characters from this book are Paran, Whiskeyjack, and Lorn; though, I must make an honorable mention of Kruppe for his carefree and faux-haughty demeanor. Steven Erikson did a great job at letting Kruppe’s wit shine through his lackadaisical and apathetic façade.\n\nAs for Paran, I enjoyed his development from a tool of the Empire to finding his own place within the world. He truly felt like a young man that joined the military for all the wrong reasons and paid the price for it. Whiskeyjack’s grief over soldiers lost under his command felt real and visceral and his ultimate acceptance of the respect and friendship from his squad felt like a good conclusion to his own demons he battles with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Closing Thoughts**\n\nThis is Steven Erikson’s debut novel and as such, it is definitely rough around the edges. That said, I think it’s better than many books written by established authors. I completely understand the praise the book receives as well as the disappointment. It’s a novel written for a certain type of reader, a reader that wants to work for an understanding of the world. I’d place it on the opposite side of the spectrum to someone like Brandon Sanderson.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed this book even with the rough edges around the story telling. It’s easy to tell this will be a series I’ll reread many times over the years and I’ll be taking inspiration for my own writing.\n\nNow on to the next book!!",

It's like Jules Verne plus steampunk plus Alice in Wonderland meets Charles Dickens. I used to hear all the time about prose and this book is an absolutely GEM in that regard. It is written in such a beautiful way that I genuinely feel like it's an old storyteller telling me a grand epic fairytale.\n I used to think good prose meant it had to be \"purpley\" or full of adjectives and metaphors, but after reading this book I've realized there is more to good prose than a bunch of metaphors and similes. \n\nJosiah Bancroft was able to create these absolutley beautiful metaphors and weave together language in such a way that it doesnt feel simple or cliche. And the prose not a slog to read. It's not like reading old English or Shakespeare. It's so effortlessly good.\nReading the book and exploring the tower of babel was like a Journey to the center of the earth or wandering through Wonderland. It just has this whimsical feeling. \n I may post later with some excerpts from the series because it is just soooooo good. I remember reading it and thinking \"Dang, this book is written so beautifully\".",

        "text": "Just wanted to share my enthusiasm for one of my most recent discoveries: Rebecca Solnit's works. And by underrated I mean that I never heard her name and it was by pure accident that I found this hidden gem.\n\nI was dusting my book shelves when a title caught my eye: Recollections of my Nonexistence. I put the book aside, thinking I might give it a try the coming days. Boy! Was I in for a treat! I can't recall the last time I was so engrossed with a book, maybe when I discovered Siri Hustvedt?\n\nWords are lifeless and still so powerful, it's amazing what a skilled person can do with them. Solnit has such an unique way with words, I love her poetical language, the nostagia that feels almost material under her pen, the thought provoking questions she's posing, the simple, yet so full of substance analogies that she makes, oftentimes I felt like she defines the indefinable or writes about things that crossed your mind, but you never thought could take the shape of words.\n\nMy edition is in German and since I ached to read it in original language, I ordered the English version and Orwell's Roses in addition to it. :) I can barely wait!\n\nJust wanted to hear if there are any other Solnit fans in here and if you read her other books as well. Would love to hear your opinion!",

The cover featured I believe a green, pasture-like background with a teenage boy featured front &amp; center wearing a ruff, kinda like Shakespeare. Funny enough, the story was about the boy, who had an obsession with Shakespeare, contracting the bubonic plague &amp; having visions of being Shakespeare himself. It switched back &amp; forth to his perspective to his family’s perspective of looking at him in the hospital &amp; his near death experience. The book wasn’t that good, but I was hoping to find it just to see if anyone has seen or heard of this before. Much thanks!",
