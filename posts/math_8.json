        "text": "Hello there!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI created a loan calculator in C# where it calculates the monthly payment and also the amount paid for interest and principal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI learnt that we have few ways to calculate the interest, having the 30/360, Actual/360 and Actual/365 methods.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe calculator is working fine and it shows the correct monthly payment amount with Excel's PMT formula or using the formula `(principal * (r/n)) / (1 - Math.Pow(1 + (r/n), -n*t))` that I got from this video: [How To Calculate The Total Interest Cost of a Car Loan](https://youtu.be/sl5D2JCPpcY)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI used this [https://amortizecre.com](https://amortizecre.com) to check the results with my calculator and the monthly payment, interest and principal values matched for the 30/360 method. However, the monthly payment amount will change when switching between Actual/360 and Actual/365. The interest amount is expected to change based on the number of days in the month.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor example, with the following loan:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPrincipal: $1,000,000.00\n\nTerm(t): 30 years\n\nInterest Rate(r): 4%\n\nSchedule: Monthly\n\nLoan Start Date: 03/01/2023\n\nFirst Payment: 04/01/2023\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe get the following results:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Method|Monthly Payment|Interest|Principal|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|30/360|$4,774.15|$3,333.33|$1,440.82|\n|Actual/360|$4,808.53|$3,444.44|$1,364.09|\n|Actual/365|$4,776.41|$3,397.26|$1,379.15|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUsing the formula I get the same monthly payment when using the 30/360 method but I couldn't figure out how the online calculator got to those different monthly payment amounts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs there a different formula or do we need to tweak the formula depending of the method? How the calculator got that $4,808,53 amount for actual/360 method?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank y'all!",

In general, does the accumulation of these random changes lessen the sensitivity towards the initial conditions and make the system non-chaotic?\n\nMy totally uniformed guess is that the system will be very sensitive towards random fluctuations in the \"recent\" past, but not arbitrarily far in the past. As we look further and further into the past, a larger portion of the current state can be attributed towards more recent fluctuations, and less and less of the variance can be attributed to the initial conditions.",

To me, by saying x^0 means that the number is non-existent, or would no alter the equation. This makes sense to make it a quantity of 1, as it wouldn‚Äôt change a multiplication/division/etc. problem.\n\nHowever, if you add x^0, you are increasing the value by nothing, but also by 1. So, to me, the correct way to write this should be that it equals 1 if you are doing any sort of multiplication/division, and 0 if there will be addition/subtraction as the next step.\n\nCan someone explain how this is, or is there some unwritten rule that when teaching, x^0 will always be multiplied as it has very little function, but it simplistically answers the question?",

How would I find the length of the shadow while also being able to rotate the shape? \n\nI thought that: if somehow I could find the length of the square in the axis (or angle) that the light is coming from, I could divide it by 2 to get the shadow length. The dividing by 2 is due to the fact that each square is a convex shape and thus each line that passes through a square passes through exactly two points.\n\nI did come up with an equation for any 2D n-sided convex polygon:  \n\n\n[Equation](https://preview.redd.it/rquanno3rrla1.png?width=772&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7ef688a95dd2173ebfe146850f46d222e19e4336)\n\nWhere the polygon has the side lengths\n\n[Side Lengths](https://preview.redd.it/fl204sr8rrla1.png?width=267&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6ddf30bd40b6a873e6a307ebb5ea56005c9ca550)\n\nAnd the angles between the two sides are shown as\n\n[The angle between two sides](https://preview.redd.it/bfyjuibnrrla1.png?width=267&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=86d04f1ce31256cfab3be6b617c08b5e1f7ed021)\n\nAnd where there is an initial rotation of the entire shape, Œ∏ (theta).\n\nNow there is something I don't like about this equation, which is that it doesn't look beautiful. Besides, I am not sure that it even works per se.\n\nWhat can I do to get rid of that summation? Perhaps I can use something like integration, or some differential equations?\n\nAlso, how would I increase the dimension up to 3 dimensions?
