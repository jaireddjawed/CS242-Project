        "text": "Hey r/watches! So I’ve recently sold a good chunk of my affordable collection of watches on Chrono 24, and I’ve currently narrowed down my list of keepers to a Citizen Promaster Dive, Sinn 556i RS, Dufrane Deep Eddy, Seiko Alpinist, and an Islander ISL-049.\n\nMy problem has always been that I’ve impulse purchased affordable watches, but that led to my collection to grow far too big to enjoy, so I’d like to start buying more expensive pieces and really take my time in deciding what to buy. \n\nBut I need help! I’m currently deciding on what to get next. I’ve tried on a couple of Zodiacs and Tudors at a local AD. Breitlings are way to large for my wrist and IWC was a little expensive for what they were offering. Sinn and CW don’t have any in person AD for me to try on, so I’m sort of hesitant to drop the cash to get one if I’m not sure it will fit my wrist correctly. So I’m hoping to get some advice on some pieces that I was looking at. Any complaints? Glowing reviews? Interesting history? About any of the following:\n\nTudor Black Bay GMT - Tried it on, a little thick but definitely way less than what I was expecting. Looked great on my wrist. \n\nOmega Seamaster 300 Diver - Very popular watch among collectors, but didn’t get a chance to try it on.\n\nSinn 104 - I love the look and if it’s anything like my 556, I’d buy it without hesitation. The only thing I’m worried about is the lug to lug. I tried on a Zodiac Sea Wolf, which has similar dimensions and it just looked wrong. Is the lug to lug much different?\n\nZodiac Super Sea Wolf Worldtimer- while the regular divers looked weird, the gmt looked great on wrist, but I’ve heard bad things about zodiac customer service and QC.\n\nC. Ward Aquitaine GMT and Sealander GMT - I’ve had no experience with CW, but they look very nice. Any word on CW?",

        "text": "On a recent trip to Aruba I finally went ahead with buying a new Speedmaster Professional after much debate and research. Thought I'd share my experience as I know others had struggled with similar questions.\n\nI wanted the Sapphire model for the open caseback, but strongly preferred the brushed look of the bracelet that came with the Hesalite. When I mentioned this at the boutique, the manager said he'd heard this from others too and if it made the difference, he'd find a way to swap.\n\nThen I asked about the recent update with the micro-adjustment, which he hadn't heard anything about. I sent him the article below, and on looking into it he found that his recent watch shipments didn't have the new one, but that the separate bracelets did - which is how he was planning to do the swap anyway.\n\nSo, after a couple rounds of back and forth I left very happy, with a new-version brushed bracelet on the Sapphire watch. I'm glad I did as the half-link adjustments makes a big difference.\n\nNot sure if others have found boutiques or dealers willing to do this, but if you find yourself in Aruba, Mohit was fantastic.\n\nhttps://www.fratellowatches.com/updated-bracelet-for-the-omega-speedmaster-professional-3861/",
