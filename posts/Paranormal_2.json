I've searched around a bit &amp; have no leads as to what this thing even is. Any help would be GREATLY appreciated.\nHere is what I do know about it along with some general background knowledge. \n\n\n -The being has only ever appeared to her in reflections, specifically windows to my knowledge.\n\n -It's only shown its head in the reflection, with her only being able to make out two eyes &amp; a smile at one point.\n\n -It seems to be able to interact with electronics to some extent, having drained her &amp; her friends phone when she had first encountered it. \n\n -It can interact with her to some extent, having created a shock like feeling on her neck twice, flicking one of her fingers, &amp; touching her arm.\n\n -It can mimic voices, having mimicked one of her friends voices when she first encountered it &amp; my voice at one point. Tho all it did was copy what I said. \n\n -It said the names of 3 of her exs at one point, then my name.\n\n -It made her room smell like smores. We have a working theory that it might be connect to her experiencing her first crush while camping due to the previous statement but are unsure. \n\n -It was originally targeting a friend of hers before she stood up to it &amp; it started messing with her.\n\n -The being CAN be seen in photos, since my gfs friend had taken a photo of it &amp; sent it to her. I am unsure if she still had it but will ask for it when she wakes up. (She's sleeping rn after some stuff that went down so I wanna let her rest.)\n\n -Whenever the being is near she gets an unsettled feeling &amp; has the feeling of being watched. She said it felt like she was spinning while standing complete still.\n\n -The being has only answered one question she's asked, which was \"What are you?\" To which it responded \"reflection.\" We think that has something to do with why it only appears in windows but we don't know. \n\n -My gfs mom is a practicing witch &amp; has done rituals to keep malicious entities out of the house.\n\n -Ever sence the being started messing with her she has had negative responses to touching items with positive energy. Her hands burning blessed crystals for example.\n\n -The friend who initially was being targeteds mom dabbled in some witchcraft.\n\n\nThis is all I know on the top of my head, if you have any questions please feel free to ask. Any leads would be helpful. I don't know much about this stuff but I love her &amp; wanna help her in any way I can.",

The summer before my mom was diagnosed with stage 3 pancreatic cancer she saw a ghost with a hat on plain as day in the middle of the day while we were at school. This clicked in my sister’s mind because she was obsessed with South Korean culture and read that seeing this ghost over there with a hat on signified something very tragic would happen in your life. My mom died that November in 2017 btw. It took me a couple years before I could hold eye contact for more than a split second. \n\n\nFrom the time I was 9-13 I felt like someone was in my room with me watching me sleep, maybe inches away from touching me all the time on a regular basis. Sometimes I would develop this sense of courage and jump out of bed and sprint for my bedroom light to see if I could “catch” what was watching me \n\n\nAfter my mom died I had multiple dreams of people trying to kill me, one very vivid one where all of my neighbors were angry and looking for me and I was executed by my next door neighbor at the end of that dream\n\n\nI woke up to my sister screaming after experiencing sleep paralysis when I was 6, she said a giant egg was sitting on top of her and choking her.",

        "text": "Help Identifying a Spirit\n\nHello everyone,\n\nI (M22) am going to a college in Ohio. I live in a fraternity house that used to belong to the town (the school buys out properties and houses students in them). My house has been displaying some… interesting… encounters. \n\nLast year (around February or March), one of my housemates and I were talking in the hallway outside of the bathroom. We were there for at least 30 minutes, bathroom was empty, no one went in or out. Then the shower suddenly turned itself on. For context, the shower handle is one that points to the ground when off, and rotates counter clockwise to turn it on. We looked at each other, and went to check it out. The handle was turned 90 degrees counter clockwise. I turned it off, and we resumed our conversation.\n\nLast semester (around September), I was at E-Sports practice. One of my friends had sent me a SnapChat of my room from the outside, asking what I was doing. When I opened the photo, there was a figure standing in my room. This was more concerning considering my room is a single, and I am the only one with a key (outside of skeleton keys kept by campus security).\n\nAt this point, we had assumed it was the spirit of the old man who, conveniently enough, passed away in the room that I’m in.\n\nAt the end of last semester (around early December), my girlfriend (F20) and I were sitting on my bed, talking. We heard a voice outside of my door. Both of our heads snapped in the direction, as it was either a young or female voice, and rest of the house is male. When we asked the others about it, (who were all downstairs, no one was outside my door), they all swear they didn’t hear anything, or do anything.\n\nA few weeks ago, I, my girlfriend, one of my frat brothers, and his girlfriend were in the living room playing Mario Kart when there was a sudden loud bang. We all went to check it out. The shower curtain rod had fallen from its fastened spot. 2 years living there, and it never fell before.\n\nFinally, last night was one of the weirdest. I had heard the same voice from last December, and it was trying to speak to me inside my own head. There was what seemed to be radio interference (best I can describe), as it kept cutting out. It began to imitate sounds outside. I’d hear a car drive by, then a few moments later, hear a distorted version of it in my head. After this went on for a while, it screamed at me, “F***ING LISTEN!!!” (Censored, ofc).\n\nI hadn’t planned on discussing this, hoping it was a dream, until my girlfriend told me she heard a growl this morning, and asked if I had experienced anything.\n\nOur conclusion as of now is that there are 2 spirits in the house. The old man, who is peaceful, and whatever this other thing is. Any assistance on identifying it, or general advice would be welcome. Thank you in advance to everyone’s help!\n\n\n\n\nUpdated Information as of February 22nd, 2023:\n\nMy fraternity brother (M20), his girlfriend (F19), my girlfriend, and I took turns going under with the Estes Method. We got some partial information when the other three were under, but the spirit seemed to be extremely happy to speak to me, as it yielded the most responses. \n\nThis is going to sound weird, and I am still having trouble processing it all, but it seems that the spirit “wants” me. I’m not sure exactly what it means by that, but it definitely doesn’t sound good. For example, when asked “What do you want?”, the spirit would respond “him”, whilst I was under.\n\nMy girlfriend has a somewhat special connection to energy (I don’t know the official term, but she’s an empath, and feels that she can control how the energy flows through her, I don’t know if I’m even describing that correctly). She has been using her energy to protect me, and the spirit knows it. It repeatedly was telling her to leave the room, leave the house, and not to come back. We tested having her leave the room, and the aggressiveness increased, resulting in my quitting when I heard a voice scream “HE WILL BE MINE”. Chilled to the bone, I removed the headphones and blindfold, and called the session to a stop.\n\nSince doing the Estes Method about a week ago, most of the activity has died off, with the exception of things occasionally falling off of their sound resting places, the TV randomly turning on, off, or pausing, and I am having a hard time staying asleep. \n\nA few days ago, my girlfriend and I both tested positive for Covid, although I doubt it’s connected to this spirit, it definitely has not helped settle any nerves, and we are now quarantined to my room.\n\n\nHopefully this added info helps anyone who might have an idea of what’s going on, or the previous commenters with additional thoughts of what to try next.\n\nThank you to everyone who has prayed, thought of, or tried this far to help, and to anyone in the future who does the same.\n\n\n\nUpdated info as of March 12, 2023:\n\nNote: this was written right after the incident in to my notes on my phone, so I could document the encounter, and check for grammar later.\n\nI thought I had heard my girlfriend talking to me. She told me that she was missing me. She told me that she loved me. She told me that she is with me. Then I thought she told me to open my eyes, so I did so. I was met with the face of our Squishmello, Willy the Dragon. I began shaking violently, my heart racing and hearing a pounding in my head. I was completely terrified. I was unable to speak, trying to rouse her. I was trying to tap her with my foot, but to no avail. All of a sudden it stopped, and I am now typing this. I have never felt that way before. I have never had this occurrence before, and I am extremely freaked out. I don’t think I’m sleeping for the rest of the night.\n\nThoughts after reflection of the event:\n\nI don’t know if it was the beginning phases of a possession, a panic attack, sleep paralysis, or a combination of a few of them. I have had an anxiety attack before, but this was a completely different feeling and experience. I’ve done some research online, but have not found anything useful yet.\n\nIf anyone else stumbles upon this, and has any idea of what may have happened, please tell me. I’m still freaked out.",

        "text": "At exactly 12:34am, every smoke detector in our house went off.\n\nBackstory: we bought this house about a month ago, first home. From night one, my fiancé and I have continued to witness unexplainable things around the home. The motion-detecting lights in the hall bathroom turning on in the middle of the night seems to be the number one hit, and I guess it should be mentioned that each time it’s happened, my fiancé and I and both dogs are present and accounted for in our bedroom down the hall. I keep having dreams of a woman in the house. I’ve caught my fiancé having conversations with himself when I was on the other side of the house, heard him talking, went to see who he was talking to, and he said he was talking to me. He was adamant that he saw me standing right behind him the whole time, but I was nowhere around. Stuff like that.\n\nAnyway, tonight, we jumped out of bed to investigate the smoke detectors going off and found that, upstairs, a box had caught fire. Upstairs was thick, full of smoke. We were able to put it out pretty quickly before it turned serious, but he and I both agree there’s no explanation for the fire. We went to bed hours ago. The wooden box that was ablaze sits atop an antique dresser I recently purchased secondhand (not sure if that detail’s relevant, but I don’t want to miss anything in my recounting). It’s a small wooden box, the contents of which being a large sage smudge stick which I’ve probably had for over a year now, along with a bundle of incense sticks, and a small glass bottle of sandalwood oil. The smudge stick was burned all the way down to ashes, every single stick of incense was lit, but all of them only about a quarter of the way down, and the plastic lid to the bottle of oil was completely melted from the outside. Now, the timing for these items’ burning also seems strange, to me. This large stick of sage would take hours to burn all the way down, which it was, but the incense sticks all being only burned a quarter of the way down means they lit from the top maybe about 15-20 minutes ago?\n\nAnyway, no one was up there. Like I said, we’d been in bed for hours. There are no electronics near the box, no batteries, there is a candle but it wasn’t lit and it was untouched by the fire, there are no lighters or matches near, and I just can’t think of a single rational explanation other than the paranormal.\n\nThoughts? Suggestions? SOS 🥲",

Even if I tried to stay calm and observe, on the inside was a completely different situation.\n\nI asked if I was dreaming and he calmly said no to me, then continued to tell me that he came to me to say goodbye because he couldn't leave without saying anything to me. \nMy eyes overflow with tears.\nHe also said to tell my mom that she is strong and he loves her &amp; me very much. \nHe said after this that he must go. \nI begged him to stay.\nBut he said that he must and that this isn't the end. \n\nWe said our goodbyes.\nShortly after this, whiteness appeared in the middle of the room, (I have no idea how to describe the material or portal, aura, mirage or whatever it was, I wish to know), he went towards it till everything got back to normal. \nHe disappeared and because I heard my mom cooking in the kitchen I immediately run out of bed to tell her everything that happened. \nMy mom believed. We sat for a while crying.\nEverything was very fresh. \n\nGoing back to the part where he was sitting close to me on the bed. \nHe looked different, he had such a powerful, white aura around himself too. He was glowing and healthy but at the same time different, very serious like he got all the knowledge of the world. \n\nEven if I started from this experience as my first post, it's very personal to me. \nI hope you will respect it.\nHowever, I had much more terrifying paranormal and mystical incidents happen to me while growing up. \nIf you want me to open up to you, let me know and I'll see what I could do about it.\n\nAnd of course, thank you for staying. \nDon't judge too much, because English isn't my first language, and I wasn't social for a while but if you want to give me any tips on how to improve, you are very welcome to do so.",

        "text": "I am new to this sub even though I am a longtime believer, so I hope it’s ok that I’m sharing this experience from two nights ago. I’m not sure what we experienced but I’ve spent the last 48 hours trying to figure it out and I’m stumped. Hoping someone here might have an idea. \n\nSo my husband and I drove from NYC to DC/NOVA the other night at 8pm. We’ve done this drive dozens of times in both directions and we typically leave at night because we prefer night driving. No matter what it, takes us anywhere from 3 hours 45 minutes to 4 hours 30 minutes, except when there’s major construction, or an accident, or just crazy traffic. \n\nWhen I checked GPS as we left it was 8:04pm. Our ETA was 12:08am, so it was predicting a 4hr 4min drive, which is normal. I’m positive this time is correct because my husband picked me up from work and we hit the road immediately. \n\nWe stopped one time for a drive through dinner and to walk our dog. This was an approximately 30 min stop. We didn’t need to fill up on gas because my husband filled it up before he picked me up. There was no traffic at any point of the drive or construction projects that decreased highway lanes. \n\nAnyway, all this is to say that we got to our destination at 1:45am, a full hour plus (taking into account our dinner pit stop) later than we should have. Neither of us realized this until we pulled into my in-laws driveway, and at that point we were both tired and just wanted to get to bed. \n\nThe next morning we were chatting our family and they asked why we were so late getting in and when we tried to explain it we couldn’t. There’s nothing that makes sense for us getting to our destination as late as we did. No wrong turns, no traffic, no extra stops. My husband, the driver, says he got really drowsy at one point and was thinking about pulling over to a rest stop to stretch but then had a sudden burst of energy and didn’t need to. \n\nThis was not a particularly spooky or compelling experience, but I just can’t account for that extra hour. This is a drive we do very frequently and it’s never been a nearly 6 hour trip for us. Any ideas of what could have happened? I tried to list all relevant details here but if there’s anything else I can elaborate on I’d be happy to do that in the comments.",

To provide some context, I live on a 20 acre horse ranch in the pandhandle of Florida, about a half hour from the Alabama border, and 15 minutes ago I heard the strangest “animal” sounds I’ve ever heard. It happened almost right outside the property, which is only about 50 feet away from where I am right now. \nIt was a very, very loud whistle. I heard it 4x, spaced out by like 15-30 seconds, each whistle was different, so repeating tunes or notes, and was loud enough to sound like it was echoing across the property.\nAfter the 4 whistles, it was followed up with an almost “sigh” sound, then nothing …\n\nSo to sum it up, it sounded like somebody was facing the property just outside the fence line whistling 4 different tunes, followed by an almost frustrated sigh then silence. \nWhat’s even more strange is it was dead quiet while this was happening, shortly after the silence I could hear a pack of coyotes in the distance which happens all the time, and owls over the lake, which is also frequent.",

I've felt a strong urge to become religious because of this but I've realized that is not the right choice for me. For me I need to just be who I am. I don't need to label that. I can't tell people in my life though because they don't really believe or they get frustrated trying to prove a point. I just don't know how to even approach the subject. \n\nI just have visions. They're not hallucinations. I know what hallucinations are. It's just an instant image that comes to my mind. It's a feeling of just knowing that image so well. That happens a lot. I've always felt weird fear. Like my teacher was telling us about something in the bible and I just  feared that people were gonna figure out she was talking about me. I guess peoples names sometimes. Some of my visions include places that I know so well yet I've never been and they are set in different time periods. \n\nIt can be exhausting though. I forget to focus on things that are important. Getting out of bed is hard because of these things. My dreams are literally very powerful. I find myself lying in bed for hours in and out of dreams. I know I need to get up but I can't. I sleep for up to 13 hours because of this. Nobody really relates. I've been on meds and I have so many appointments. I don't want to go to those anymore. I do not know how to prove that I don't need them that much. It's not good. Like I literally don't need that. I just have gifts or something that just show up randomly. I have been starting to hone them in.\n\nI just want to feel like I can talk about this. It's more about my feelings that I get because of what I experience. I know I didn't convey them in the same way I felt them. Also it's hard to describe what goes on in visions. I can't rewind them. I just haven't really been open about this.",

My work day was very recently interrupted by a very strange noise that I can best describe as a \"pulsing saw bass riser\" such as I would find in one of my VST packs. Imagine the saw bass synth from the beginning or Science Is Fun from the Portal 2 soundtrack, but slowly getting louder and higher in pitch before stopping just as suddenly as it has started. It was loud enough that I felt my home office shake a bit. \n\nMy first thought was that it almost sounded like a plane flying overheard. I live near an airport, but to be THAT LOUD it would have had to have been flying VERY low, which is unlikely considering I live in a planned development in a heavily residential area. I didn't see any lights or evidence of a plane or any flying object outside either, and after the noise cut off I didn't hear ANY noises, outside or inside, besides the sound of my own breathing and typing. This is incredible strange because, prior to the start of the sound, I'd heard my cats running around inside, and children playing/cars driving outside my house. I didn't hear any sounds outside of my own for about 5 minutes in total after the noise cut out.\n\nI've never heard anything like this before, both in my neighborhood and elsewhere. I have no rational explanation, and no idea of WHAT could have made the noise. Has anyone else experienced a noise like this, or have any idea of what it could possibly be?",

She said something to the affect of \"I know your name\" and then shoved ĥer hand through my stomach.\n\n I could feel all the muscles in my stomach cramping up and the pain went down to my legs and all through my groin too. I woke up curled into the fetal position, grunting and I could still feel the muscle cramps and pain in my abdomen, legs and groin even though I was awake now. It went on for almost an entire minute before it stopped and I was finally able to take a breath and sit up. \n\nWondering how real this dream might have been, since it was so vivid and intense and pain continued even after I woke up...I felt like something was watching me after it happened too, for a little while. Thoughts? Could there have been something to this?",

For reference, my bedroom “ceiling fan with light” for like over a year now has been broken — the fan works perfectly fine however the light does not. \n\nBy “broken” I mean the actual light feature from the “ceiling fan with light” is dysfunctional / not functional. Whenever you turn on the light it will shine bright and normal, but this will be for less than 5 minutes (sometimes it can work perfectly fine for something like an hour) before it will begin flashing and flickering before powering off. The flickering can literally be just like a stroke light.\n\nBut this is when the light feature is powered on from my remote control. I sleep every night with the “ceiling fan with light” wall/light switch turned on so that from my bed I can, through the remote control sitting on my nightstand, reach and adjust the fan however I’d like from my bed without needing to get up. The “power on” button for the light was never pressed so that the light would turn on last night. Same deal the other time my Google Nest caught flickering - the remote control switch was never pressed. \n\nWhat’s different about this time is that is doesn’t even look like light is coming from my ceiling light from when the light powers on. I sleep with blackout curtains so it cannot be explained as something from outside the window. I do have a couple of different lamps on my room — one on my desk and the other on the floor. What do you all think? Electrical issue? There were instances where it literally looked like weird floating blobs/rats coming down from the ceiling and then coming back up — moving in that way.",

My father, who is a huge skeptic, has been having strange experiences off and on for years he hasn’t talked about until recently.  The death of a person in the family and a family pet has seemed to bring things out even more so. \n\nMy best friend is into stuff like this, he’s a medium of sorts I guess. I’m not sure what exactly to call him. I called him to come by. He said there was definitely an energy at the house, a couple different things. Nothing that was harmful in any way though. Advised my dad to put a cross above the door and see if that helps. Which it did. That was about a month ago. \n\nSo now the last couple weeks out of nowhere I have been feeling all sorts of different. Like a sudden depression and insecurity that I’ve never felt. It was starting to effect me in strange ways. Especially a heavy feeling of anxiety. Not typical for me at all. My wife doesn’t have that feeling but has seen a shadow, and a white outline of a person in our apartment a few times in the last month.  I’ve seen an outline of a guy in a hat, when I told my wife she turned white. Same guy. \n\nLong story short I have a cross that was blessed by a priest long ago in storage in the basement. All day today I’ve been having the heavy feeling, so I figured I’d try putting that cross above our door. Within 5 minutes of having that in my pocket the feeling disappeared. It’s currently above my door and staying there. \nNot sure if it’s coincidence or something is going on here…or if I’m just crazy. \nI’m seeing my buddy for dinner later, and I’m going to talk with him about this for sure. \nAny of you have any thoughts about this?",

So went to my grandma’s house as  she and my grandpa were out of town for the week. Everything is completely normal; my mom is lying on a lounge chair and is drinking a beer while my sister jumps into the deep end, but me I’m entering the shallow end through the steps. As I do that my mom pulls out her phone and snaps a photo of her feet and the beer can and you barely see me in the corner. A couple days go by and I notice a couple of family members are acting weird around me and won’t say anything until finally my uncle tells me and shows me the photo of my mom, at first I don’t see it until he points and I see as clear as day what it seems to be a older man’s hand on my shoulder. We believe it’s my great grandfather Tony (but we call him Honey) and my family swears to this day they can see the start of one of his tattoos on his forearm. I never questioned if it was really him but I hear camera can simply form something that isn’t there, but recently I went back to my grandma’s and she was talking about her dog Mia that passed away two years back and how she thought she could feel her breathing over her, later that night my mom was scolding my uncle over his motorcycle accident and the fact he has a newborn and I found the scolding funny so I started recording the conversation to show my cousin and I think I caught this man’s voice twice the moment my mom mentions Honey’s name but I’m not sure if I’m just hearing things. And as for the photo maybe it was mix up? I mean his hand is so clear, are ghosts supposed to be that way?",

Anyways, mind you I grew up in this house (kinda). The structure of the house is the same. The lights/ poles across the street are the same. The pool and park structure/ lighting, across the street is the same. \n\nBefore my parents moved out, my mom is sitting on the couch which is adjacent to the front door. But the windows on the front door are frosted so you can see light/ shadows but nothing specific. Anyways, my mother is sitting on the couch and notices a figure… tall/ skinny around 6/7 feet. Shapes like a bald headed alien lol. The figure is leaning in from the right side of the glass kinda like it’s looking in from the front patio… super creepy. She noticed it for the first time ever. I saw it as well, but my step dad and sister could not see it… \n\nFast forward to today… I pretty much see this figure every night. Only at night and only at the front door. (I leave my front patio lights on for most of the night… when I turn them off you can see him even more then before) You have to see it from the back of the house but he’s there almost every night.. doesn’t move. Just looks in. Sometime the shape will change. Or it’ll change to where it looks like the figure is standing at the door just looking in. It’ll be more apparent/ sometimes he’s not even there.. but others don’t notice him. As I’ve tied to tell my friends. The only other person that’s seen him is my niece.. \n\nI’m pretty intact spiritually. If it is something. I don’t give it power. I’ve learned to not be fearful… so outside of seeing him randomly, I am not afraid of it. Most of the time I ignore it and now I just deal… he just throws me off when I look up and see him looking in and his shape has changed. I don’t joke/ play with it. And I put off enough energy to let it and anything else know my spirit/ aura/ consciousness (whatever you call it) is strong. Fuck around and find out is kinda what I say to myself, but wtf can I actually if it is a alien or worse a demon 😩\n\nWith that said, my gut is telling me it’s something. I get a playful vibe (like child’s play) from it. Like it knows I’m trying to figure it out without trying to interact with it. And it really doesn’t bother me or my children…\n\nSo here’s the point of my post, is this just the shadowing from the lighting outside or something else?",

I’ve been told a few stories from others that experienced paranormal activity while living there. It was rumoured to be a “suicide hot spot” decades ago, where students from the nearby college would take their lives due to the stressors of school. Not sure how true that is, but it might make sense as to why it’s haunted. And I personally was experiencing things that I thought I was making up or just hearing things. I swear i’ve experienced being dragged off my bed that i just chalked up to an intense lucid dream. \nAnyways, my friend and I came back to my apartment from running errands. \nI laid on my bed and I was laying on my side. I so happen to look up and see something red that came from the ceiling. As I got closer, it strongly resembled dried blood that came from my ceiling and dripped down and splattered on the wall. It wasn’t a huuuge amount, but it was there and noticeable. I vividly remember calling my friend in the room and asked her if I was delusional and maybe seeing things. She confirmed that yes, that definitely looks like blood. This experience never made sense to me. Nobody was in my apartment while we were gone, and certainly no one up far enough to be touching the ceiling. I had no red liquid in and around my room that could provide any explanation for that. The picture I took of it also mysteriously disappeared as well. There was a stain left after I scrubbed it off my wall. \nIs this an occurrence in the paranormal world? Was I experiencing a demonic entity? Has anyone else heard of the walls bleeding? I need reassurance lol",

I don’t know how to explain it but it was like I knew already. I saw and I wanted to panic and run away but it’s like I kicked into x games mode and did what I had to do while crying and feeling a mess I had the power to stay somewhat calm. It’s like my mom gave me the strength. It was just a weird feeling. Had it been my other siblings they would have freaked out. I feel as if my mom left the way she left for a reason and I think wanted me to be the one as I was the closest to her and she probably knew I’d be able to handle this. There were signs as if my mom knew this day was coming and my cat was also a acting weird. As for me I had that feeling for a few days before aswell. It’s like everything that happened before was making sense now. A lot of little things. \nAnyways on Wednesday I went to the funeral home and before I went in I see an Access van passing by like it was passing in front. My mom rode those vans because they’d pick her up from work and drop her off at home. I thought of her. Come Thursday at a drive thru I’m showing my daughter and partner pictures of my mom when she was super young. It’s our turn to pay and the cashier says the person in front of you paid for your food. I know this happens but it’s never happens to us. We were in shock and once again I felt a weird feeling and as we exit out another Access van passing by in front of us. Maybe it’s just random but I take that as signs that my mom is around. Before she passed I told her to please haunt me or give me signs she’s around us lol. She said if she could she would. Idk I just hope she’s around me. I go into her room and just talk to her in there as if she’s here. I hope she hears me.",

I could not sleep,I felt rotten but then Strange things started to happen. My family was asleep and I was alone in my room but something just shouted my door and it wasn‘t just closing it was like a harsh wind and to remind you my windows were closed. Weird things happend in my dreams I saw demonic shit things that i have Never Seen before. I decided enough is enough I stopped the Experiment with the third eye I was so sick of It.

All you need to do is go into a thrift store and pay attention.\n\nIt seems every thrift store I go in has one spot, that if you walk over it, or stand there you get instantly light-headed and dizzy, like the floor is about to drop out. But if you step away from that spot the feeling immediately goes away.\n\nI used to think it was just me, but the last time I was shopping with my best friend and it happened I called her over like I wanted to show her something and had her stand where I had been. She got a weird look on her face like she wasn't feeling well and I asked if she felt dizzy or light-headed. She said yes and commented that maybe she needed to eat. I had her move off the spot and she felt better. That's when I told her my theory.\n\nI have felt this sensation in other places but I think it's common in thrift stores because there are so many old items that come and go, one of them is bound to have destructive energy that either tore a hole in the veil between our world and the next or a hole between dimensions, depending on what you believe.\n\nHas anyone reading this experienced something similar?\nAlso, if any of you try it, please share your experiences.",

        "text": "So this happened 12 or so years ago when I was working at a community center that used to be (and still sort of is) a school. The old building is probably over 100 years old and I always got intensely creepy vibes when locking up in a certain area at night by myself. It's supposedly haunted and ghost hunters do events there every so often where they teach paranormal investigating skills.\n\nAnyway that's all background, but one afternoon I was sitting in the office with a coworker. It was Saturday so the bosses weren't around, just us part-time college kids. An older lady came in and asked me to give her a little tour around the place. I didn't really think anything of it and nothing was really going on that day, so I agreed to show her around.\n\nPeople usually rent out rooms in the front of the building for various functions, so that's what I started to show her, but she wasn't really interested in those areas. Instead she wanted to go towards the back of the building, where I always got creeped out at night. I didn't tell her about that, but that's where she wanted to go. Eventually we made our way back to the gym and on the way she told me she didn't want to weird out my co-worker, but she's sensitive to spirits (she probably phrased it slightly differently) and she could tell I was too, but my gifts hadn't been trained yet (again, paraphrasing). \n\nWhen we got to the gym, she went to a corner where she said she saw an angry male spirit torturing a little girl. I felt something too, very familiar to the creepy feeling I'd always feel locking up by myself. With her there I wasn't scared though.\n\nWe walked back towards the office and she said one day I'd learn to do what she does. That I'd have a teacher one day, and it wasn't her, but a man. She said to reach out and tap her, and she'd know I was reaching out to her, but the man is who would help me. And then... She just left. She didn't disappear or anything, she just walked out and I never saw her again.\n\nShe never tried to sell me anything, or join some cult, and no man ever showed up to do the same. I do what the lady said every now and then and reach out to her from within, and sometimes I feel like there's someone on the other end. I might be imagining things, but it was such a bizarre thing to happen. She seemed just like some normal old lady in the suburbs, and never said anything to anyone else I knew there. I tend to be wary of people trying to take advantage or people who are just way too into anything remotely paranormal but this was... Different. And that makes it feel real, even if it doesn't make sense.",

        "text": "Okay so I think this happened wen I was like 9 or  10 years old give or take a year or 2. As always I was on punishment for something I don't remember what.  Truthfully,  I never actually knew what I was on punishment for since I was on punishment so often I just  l stopped paying attention to the reason lol.  But yeah I was on punishment. This punishment wasn't as bad as usual though. I just had to stay in my room with the lights off(because my mother paid a light bill) .  I believe it was a Friday night around ten pm and my entire family was outside having fun with their friends including both of my mothers, my brother and my sister. So since no one else was in the house, all the lights in the apartment were off. So before I go any further it's important that I explain my old apartments layout. Back then we lived in a fourth floor apartment in crown heights Brooklyn. My mothers and Sisters rooms windows were located In the front of the building but my brother and I shared a room and it and it's window along with the living room, bathroom, kitchen, hallway, all of thier windows  and the front door all were located in the back of the building. So getting back to the story, my entire family is outside in the front of the building enjoying themselves as I sit on my top bunk bed lamenting on how I wished I could be outside enjoying the breeze like every one else, occasionally sighing in dismay at my current depressing situation when my brother walked into the house seemingly annoyed and walks into our room and says\n\"mommy said shut the fuck up!\"\nMe being confused as to what he was even talking about I replied\n\"But I'm not Making any noise,  I'm not even talkin,  there's no one for me to talk to.\"\nMy brother goes on to say \"listen I don't give a fuck. I didn't come up here to talk to you I'm just telling you wat ma told me to tell you\" and then he storms out of the house to go continue having fun with his friends.( can you tell that me and my brother never had a loving brotherly relationship?🤣🤣🤣🤣). So i go back to lamenting quietly being sure not to make any noise when about ten minutes later my brother once again comes into the house, heads straight for our room and once again says \n\"Oh my God,  are you fucking serious? Dude, I do not wanna keep Walkin up 4 damn flights of stairs cuz you in here crying like a big ass baby.  Could you please shut the fuck up\" \n\nOnce again me confused \" crying?  Im not crying. I'm just sitting here looking out the window\" \n\n\" stop fucking lying Erik,  mommy says she hears you crying all the way downstairs in front of the building. \" \n\n\"That doesn't even make sense, I would have to stick my head out the window and scream at the top of my lungs for her to barely hear me from the back of the 4th floor all the way in the front of the building outside on the first floor\" \n\n\" well you're the only person on the block who aint outside so who else could she be hearing?!\" \n\n\"I don't know but it's not me\" \n\n\"Well just keep quiet\" he said leaving. \n\nThis time I laid down and looked up at the cieling, exactly what I was trying to avoid beacuase back then I was afraid to look at my cieling because every night for a few months wen the lights were turned off at  bed time.  I would always see the shadow of a man wearing a hat with the brim goin all the way around it, just standing there on my cieling. I remember a few nights wen I would just get out of bed and look around my room for any combination of items that could possibly cause that shadow to cast.  Never found anything.  Other nights I'd look out the window for anything that could cast the shadow in.  There was nothing.  But anyway back to the story.  There he was in my cieling.  So once again I start looking around for things that can craft the hatman shadow in an attempts to calm my uneasiness I feel from that weird shadow.  Oddly enough one day that shadow just disappeared and I never saw it again.  But as im looking around, my brother comes in once again but this time attempting to level with me. \n\"Alright look. I'm tired of having to come up and down the damn stairs, plus mommy said she's gonna beat both of us if she hears u again. And I don't plan on getting beat for you. So if you promise to shut up I'll let u sleep on the living room couch. \"\n\"Deal\" I replied. I don't know why but back then i wanted to sleep on the couch so bad for some reason . so i grabbed a blanket and a pillow and ran into the living room and layed on the couch. I was happy because I had been asking my mother for months to lay on the living room couch. But at that moment I realized exactly how dark it was in the living room, and asked my brother on his way out the door if i could turn on the living room light. He said no because mommy would see that light spilling out of her room window. But what he would do so that he wouldn't have to come back upstairs is he would turn on our room light so the light could spill out of our room into the living room so that i could see with that light. I was good with that compromise so he turned on the light and left.\nso as i sat there in the the living room hype, I started getting this wierd uncomfortable feeling. Like something bad was going to happen. So I layed down on the couch and closed my eyes and started thinking about cartoons. But even that wasn't going too well for me. I remember I was creating scenes in my head for the Flintstones. But for some reason every scene would end in death and bloodshed.  And every death and scenario ended differently. Everytime it went bad I would restart with a new scene and scenario. This went on for maybe 5 mins with each episode getting shorter as i started getting the idea wen things would go bad and would immediately end the scene and restart.  Eventually I stopped trying to create episodes and started wondering what the hell is wrong with me? what kind of psychopath thinks of ways to kill thier favorite cartoon characters. But wat was odd was I wasn't thinking of those things.  I was ginuwinely thinking of fun episodes but those gruesome murders I was invisioning were happening independent of my actual thoughts! While I'm going through these thoughts in my head I notice that I can hear what sound like the drawers to a dresser open. But I'm so into wondering why I'm a psychopath that I don't pay it anymind. But as im questioning myself that uncomfortable feeling got super strong. And when I internally commented on it I noticed that I could hear ruffling and things hitting the floor. I could literally tell exactly where what i was hearing was coming from. It was coming from my mothers room directly in front of me. At that point I opened my eyes but it took a few seconds for my eyes to focus. I could see something white, waist height by the edge of my mothers room door. I could also see things flying by out of my mothers nightstand. I specifically remember as my eyes focused seeing my gigapet flying out of the drawer. I remember that because I was mad that my mother took it from me and it was bright yellow. That was  the only thing that I could actually tell what it was as it flew by. By this point my eyes had focused enough that I could tell when my eyes went back to the perpetrator throwing things out of my mothers drawer was the lower half of a skeleton. Like exactly what you would see in a school science class. At that point I think what ever It was must have noticed I saw it, because it just stopped rummaging and throwing things out of my mothers drawer for a second and stood up and turned towards me. The way it moved was so unnatural. As it turned towards me my stomach turned. Almost feeling like I had to throw up. The way it moved reminds me of old-school stop motion animation. Now I actually kind of like stopmotion animation but seeing it organically in life for some reason was just disgusting! When it turned to me I could see in the eye sockets was just a dull burgundy light. Once my eyes met the skeletons, it laughed. I can still remember that laugh. It sounded like a villain from an old school anime. Horrified my instincts kicked in and every fiber of my being screamed run for your life!  I flinched. I was about to hit the sprint button like I was in the Olympics going for the gold! But as my body began to move I remembered that before my mother walked out the house she said if I stepped one foot out that door for any reason she would beat my ass into next week. I had to go to school next week so no thank u. I'd like my last week of summer vacation to not be fast traveled via ass whooping. By now the skeleton stopped laughing and I was sitting there half off the couch looking at it frozen like a deer in headlights. I took a second to think of wat my next move would be. My train of thought went as follows. \nIf I run outside to my mother violence awaits no matter what, but this guy, i don't yet know his intentions. Maybe if I let him find what he's looking for he'll just leave me alone. So I jumped back into the couch in the fetal position, grabbed the blanket and covered my whole body including my face and yelled \"take whatever it is you want and go. Leave me alone!\" I sat there for what felt like 8 hours. Every second felt like 5 minutes. My senses were extremely heightened. I never heard another sound in the house but I could hear every time someone walked into the building. This is the exact moment I learned that you could Identify people by the sound of their footsteps and accessories. As I would hear people coming in my building and walking up the stairs I would listen intently hoping it was my mother coming to save me from my fear. And then noticing it wasn't her and mentally identifying which of my neighbors it actually was untill eventually I heard them. My mothers signature walking patterns. And those keys. My mother had like 20 or 30 keys on one of those metal clip key chains with a retractable chain in it. I remember hiding under the blanket thinking \" yes! I know it! Those are mommy's footsteps! And those keys! Those are definitely her keys,  no ones elses keys sound like that!\" But I didn't move I waited for conformation.  I waited for her to go to put her Keys into the door. As soon as I heard her key touch the first lock I threw the blanket off of me jumped off the couch and ran to the door like my life depended on it. Made it to the door and unlocked all 3 locks before she could fully get her key in the door turned the knob and pulled the door open so fast that I pulled my mother into the apartment damn near, because she was still holding the key she had just barely gotten into the door. \nOnce the door was open I ran to her hugging her tightly exclaiming loudly \n\" mom I'm so happy your here, I love you, iv been waiting for u for so long!\"\nMy mother knowing that I have never exactly been an affectionate or even an emotional kid looked at her wife with pure confusion on her face but lightly hugged me back and asked me if I was ok. I lied and said yeah I just missed her. She knew I was lying and called me on it, saying\n\" no seriously now I'm worried, you dont usually lie. What happened,\"\nI said \"Nothing, I'm fine I'm just glad you're here\"\nShe let it go and walked in the house into her room where her and her wife started talking about how wierd I was behaving. Once I felt I had given them enough time to get comfortable I started cautiously easing my way towards thier room trying to peek in thier door looking for things to be out of place. I couldnt see anything out of place so I just kept easing my way closer. Kind of like how a cat moves when u put something new near them and they cautiously check it out. As I grew closer my mother walked out of her room running into me. Confused once again by my odd behavior she yelled \" demonio \" what the hell are you doing now?!! I'm not playing with you what the hell happened?!\"\nMe: \" I don't want to tell you because you're not going to believe me\"\nMom: \"why wouldn't I believe you?\" \nMe: \" you're gonna call Mr stupid or a liar.\"\nMom: \" I'm not going to call you stupid or a liar. Now tell what the hell is bothering you\" \n\nMe: \" Are some of the things from your nightstand drawer on the floor?\" \nMom: \" no, why would they be?\"\nMe: \" I saw a ghost and it was going through your drawer and throwing things.\" \nMom: \" you're lying now tell me what happened\" \nMe: \" see I told you you'd think I'm lying\"\nMom: \" you want me yo tell you why i dont believe you? Because if you saw a ghost you would have ran out of the house. I know because that's what I would have done. If I'd seen a ghost I don't care wat happened I would have left! Especially if I was alone!.\"\nMe: \"I was going to! But when I got ready to run I remembered you said you would beat me if  stepped one toe outside of the front door for any reason\nMom: \"I would have gotten my ass whipped then. You're stupid for that!\"\nMe: \" actually I think I made the right choice, if I ran away and told you I would have gotten beaten either way, I didn't know wat he was going to do. So I decided it would be safer to find out his intentions before getting beat. And look nothing happened to me.\" \nMy mother had a look of absolute shock on her face for a second before busting out into laughter. At that point I walked past my mother to her room door and greeted my stepmother before scanning the clean floor to find nothing out of place. Oddly enough, im sure it's unrelated but when I got off punishment and asked my mother for my gigapet back she couldn't find it. That gigapet was never found again.\nR.i.p: gigapet, gone but never forgotten.🙏🙏🙏",

Another one, we had this huge wood block and I would hear it begin dragged; I would hear knock on the window; while in the bathroom would turn off the lights the turn it on. \n\nMy brother; he used to sleep in the guest house kinda separate from the house; he says one time he woke up at 2 or 3 AM and saw a baby crawling toward him, he jumped over him and went to the streets and the sunrise.\n\nMy another brother; he went to my brother's room because he had cables to watch a movie. He tells after finish watching he unplugged the TV and left the room. As soon as he left he would hear the TV playing. \n\nMy sister; she said once she saw the wood block beging dragged by itself (I never saw it begin dragged by itself but I would hear it beging dragged) \n\nMy mother she says; when she is praying she would always feel someone behind hear whispering. \n\nAlso, we would usually see a black cat roaming in the house even thou we kicked her multiple times.",

        "text": "  Thank you for taking the time to read this. Any feedback that I can get would be immensely appreciated, be it comment or private messaging. \n    This event happened in the summer of 2009, my junior year of high school. What makes this “ghost story” different than 99% of any others you may come across is that I was not alone. I was riding in a vehicle with my best friend. We were both stone cold sober, not particularly sleep deprived and his retelling of the night is identical to mine in almost every way. \n    We were both leaving our fast food summer job and rode home together, him driving me in the front passenger seat in an “open” jeep. Top off, doors off, summertime. You get the picture. There is a large cemetery in Irwin Pennsylvania that is divided in half by a road that we frequently took home as a short cut. As we were turning onto that rode, I was playing Tetris on the rinky dink flip phone I had while we discussed our shift that night. \n    The next thing I knew my friend, jon, slammed on the brakes so incredibly hard that my phone and food that was on my lap went flying. I could audibly hear his tires squeal. My first reaction was to turn my head left to ask wtf his problem was. When I glanced at him he was staring straight ahead, eyes bulging and face pale from what I remember. \n    As I looked up I saw what I can best describe as a hunched over hooded figure with a small pointed head, about seven feet in front of us, crossing the road. It was hard to make out sharp details but it seemed to have some sort of walking stick and a limp. It seemed to almost glide with walking movements but the speed it moved at was unnatural. It turned its head to look at us as it crossed the road but I could not make out any facial features. We sat dumbfounded and watched it crest over the hill towards the children’s cemetery. I also had the impression it was female but that is just instinct. \n  My friend and I discuss this frequently and nothing I can find online sounds remotely close to what we saw. It’s always one person stories lacking detail as well. Any ideas, questions, or comments would be amazing! Thank you so much guys!",

I’m 27 now and live on my own. My parents house is right down the street from me and this thing that happened kinda scared me. So my brother is two years younger than me and we loved playing Pokémon for the DS. He lost his and him and I were searching the house for hours. We got to my room and pull out the toy box which was purple and pretty big. It was filled to the brim with legos and other assortments of toys. I don’t know what came over me but I got really light headed and stuck my hand in the toy box and just pulled out the DS game. My brother swore he heard me say something underneath my breath but I don’t remember this. It kinda scared us and now thinking about it, I just don’t know what sudden urge came over me to know where it actually was. It was generally very freaky to be honest.",

        "text": "Hey guys, so I’ve always been into ghosts and spirits and the paranormal. However I’ve never had many paranormal experiences. The only things I can remember that I would class as paranormal were:\n\n1. For 2 summers in a row, there would be one day in the 6 week holidays for school (UK) where a woman who looked to be wearing niqab, all black, stood still on the path in the park that was past our house. When I looked out my window I saw her. She was there for around 6 hours; same place; not moving. \n\n2. When I was younger I used to sleep with my bedroom light off, but my door open and the landing light on. One morning I woke up and as soon as I opened my eyes, everything was still dark for a second and my landing light was on. In an instant it turned to daylight and as you would expect everything to look.\n\n3. This one seems the most paranormal. I was house and dog sitting for my Nan and grandad while they went on holiday. They had a big block of a tv in their bedroom that was probably from the 70’s. I went to the loo one time and I heard football chants, and my nan and grandads tv had turned on by itself?? \n\n\nBut I actually get excited when these things happen, it’s spooky and it scares me but also I feel better knowing that spirits are real in a way. My dad passed away when I was 4 and i have carried grief and trauma with me my whole life because of this. I miss him with everything I have and I don’t know if it’s possible but I want to know it I am able to make myself…idk, maybe more susceptible to paranormal experiences or a connection to that world?\n\nSorry for the silly post, I’m pretty new to Reddit but thought this be the best place to go.",

        "text": "Okay guys I lived in this house for about 7 years and I have a LOT of stories from it so sorry if this is long. I have ADHD so I tend to ramble but I’m gonna keep it chronological and as structured as I can. Let me know if you want a part 2!\n\nSome background info: This is in a small town in central Texas. The house is a one story, 3 BR, 2 Bath with a front and back living room a nice sized back yard with a palm tree, gazebo, and a shed converted into a “bar”. It was right across the street from a Catholic Church/ cemetery and after we moved out we found out the property used to be an orphanage in the 1960s that shut down because before that it was a funeral home with a crematorium that the orphanage was using to dispose of the bodies of the malnourished/ abused children living there. We (me and my immediate family) were initially hired to clean up the house after the previous tenants trashed it. By trashed I mean TRASHED! The carpet when we cleaned it was a light beige color but it started out black. There were human sized holes in the walls as if someone was slammed repeatedly all through the house. Dead chickens and other small animals were all over the floor along w black candles, pentagrams on the walls and floor and some mystery blood smeared on the back closet of the master bedroom. How’d we feel comfortable enough moving in after all we found? Well when it was cleaned up it was a really nice place and the rent was only $450 a month (we should’ve known just based off the low rent).\n\nFirst Incident:\nIt was our first day in the house. I had most of my stuff in already so my parents told me to wait at the new house while they went to our old house with my siblings to get more stuff. I decided to take a nap after putting a few things on my dresser. In the center of the dresser I put a Mary candle my mom had given me. Might be important to note that the most Satanic stuff was found in the master bedroom that had a walk in closet, dressing room, and its own bathroom. This room became my room because everyone else were too scared to even set foot in it including my parents. The whole 7 years we lived there the only time anyone else but me set foot in the room was before we moved in while we were cleaning the house. My little brother got the middle bedroom and my little sister got the room next to his at the end of the hall next to the other bathroom and my parents opted to turn the back living room into their bedroom. After arranging my stuff on the dresser I laid on my bed to take a nap while waiting for my family to return with more stuff. Not 2 minutes after I shut my eyes the candle slid off the right side of the dresser to the floor with a thud. I was a little freaked out but as I was by myself I tried not to so I tried rationalizing it saying it was the wind or my dresser is crooked/ slanted. I checked the dresser by pulling it away from the wall a smidge and putting a ball in the center to see if it rolled and it didn’t. Then I checked all the doors and windows to make sure there wasn’t a draft or something. I put the candle back in the center and laid back down. Not a minute or so after I shut my eyes the candle slid off the left side this time like someone was sliding it and fell. I said “NOPE!” And ran outside and waited on the porch til my family got back. When they questioned why I was outside because it was summer and Texas is hellishly hot in summer I replied that I wanted some fresh air and sun trying to play it off so they wouldn’t think I was crazy.\n\n2nd Incident: This was after we had been living there a few months. I was asleep in my room with the door open because it made me feel better and the rest of my immediate family were gathered in my sister’s room down the hall telling each other ghost stories as it was close to Halloween. My mom said something along the lines of “Y’all better stop telling that stuff before something happens” Right after she said that my door slammed shut and I started screaming. (Side note: when I was younger I used to sleep talk/ walk a LOT especially if there was paranormal activity in the house as this wasn’t the last time we lived in a haunted house unfortunately) My mom urged my step dad to go check on me but he just said “You go f-king check on her” so eventually they both came to check on me. They said once they opened the door they saw me sitting up in bed with my eyes open but glassy and not focused on anything. I kept saying “Get off me get off me help”. They were too scared to enter the room so from the door they switched on the light and said “GET OUT”. At that moment they said a black cloud lifted off me and I fell back in bed with my eyes closed fast asleep. Then they FREAKING LEFT ME THERE BECAUSE THEY WERE TOO SCARED and told me about it in the morning. I knew they weren’t lying because the dream I had the night before matched up with what they were saying and they both looked kinda pale when they were telling me. Scaredy-cat jerks leaving me in there 😂 \n\nI’m gonna end up doing a part two later as there is a lot more but any additional info needed or any questions please comment and ask away!",

We chilled out and played video games for most of the day but when it got late we decided to go to sleep. When i was younger I never closed the door because I was scared something would happen and if i screamed my parents wouldn’t hear me. We both fell asleep in my bed I was about two or three feet away from him in bed. I woke up in the middle of the night and heard something outside my door. I decided to sit up and look out my door, what I saw still gives me chills to this day. I saw what looked like a demonic version of my grandmother on her hands and knees outside my door. It noticed me and looked me in my eyes and its eyes looked demonic. It had long hair down to its chest.i immediately layer back down and tried to wake my friend up but he wouldn’t wake up. I sat up and it was gone. I didn’t look around the room to see if it came in I just laid back down and closed my eyes and prayed It was gone until I fell asleep. The next morning I told my grandmother what i saw and she said it may have been her bc she dropped her glasses. the only reason I don’t believe that is because she had short hair (down to her neck) and it had hair to its chest and different eyes and it wasn’t wearing the same clothes as her and the time she said she dropped her glasses just didnt seem like the same time I woke up. I still get chills when I think back to that day… this makes me believe we all have a demonic version of ourselves (a demon that looks just like us). Has anyone else had any similar experiences?",

        "text": "In the days following the 9/11 attacks on America, a strange phenomenon would soon capture the attention of millions of people across the internet. Shared from user to user through email and online messaging platforms, this visual enigma featured the haunting image of a devil which eerily took shape in the massive explosion caused by the impact of the second plane into the South Tower of the World Trade Center.\n\nThough I had heard of the image not long after the attacks, I wouldn't see it myself until a few years later in 2003. Immediately I knew what I was looking at wasn't a random event and became determined to get to the bottom of it.\n\nSlowly but steadily, I would uncover many bizarre details of the phenomenon as I carefully studied the CNN video frame by frame in my spare time. It took about nine years to discover the helmet thing *(you can see what that means if you check out the video at my website).* The following year I made an important connection that allows the image to be deciphered into a message. Three years later as the fifteenth anniversary of the September 11th attacks approached, I would stumble across one of the phenomenon’s most haunting secrets- the facial similarity between the devil figure and al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. It was a very strange and overwhelming experience. I was so weirded-out I had to lay down and didn’t return to it for about ten days.\n\nThere is much more to the story and the phenomenon and if you are reading this you must be interested in solid evidence of the paranormal. Because the Devilsmoke was filmed on video from CNN and in a photograph by the Associated Press, it may be one of the few genuine supernatural events ever captured on verifiably authentic media. So if you are interested in hearing more just reply and I will send you the link to my website which has a video that lays it all out...",

        "text": "This experience happend a while back but i thought i might as well share it on here for you guys to read. So back in the mid 2000's I lived in this house with my dad, my mum and my sister. Across the road from this house was this massive mansion which had a lot of residential turnover which my family, me included, believes is cursed. My sister and I were kind of scared of it anyways because it was this big dark house that felt uninviting and cold. When my family moved in to our house there was a wealthy business man living in the mansion across the road who moved in a few months before us. This guy was really rich, luxury cars, massive dinner parties with his rich friends, etc. He owned a bunch of business' started a new business shortly after we moved in and after almost 6 months of starting this business he went bankrupt. He lost every, he sold all of his luxury cars, he had no more dinner parties and he quickly became an alcoholic. He ended up selling his house because he of course couldn't afford it. \n\nAfter he sold the house a young recently married couple moved in. I have no idea how they afforded the house but non the less they moved in and settled in quickly. My parents actually become quite good friends with them and we would have them over for dinner occasionally. They stayed in the house for about two years but within that two years they'd had 3 miscarriages. The wife ended up becoming depressed and even had to be committed to a psych ward because she was thinking about ending her own life. \n\nThese two incidents could be just classified as bad luck or unfortunate events but the third one in my opinion solidify's this house as being cursed. So another couple moved into the house after the other couple decided to move and this couple were pretty wealthy. They hired a maid to stay in the house to assist them with cooking and cleaning etc. After a year of them living there we once again got pretty close to this couple and would sometimes have dinner with them and swim in the pool that they had. One night my dad woke up and had a strange feeling. He heard something outside so looked out the his bedroom window and saw the maid packing her car in the middle of the night. The couple that was living there was away for the weekend and the maid was staying at the house. He thought it was weird and was a bit concerned but didn't think much of it and went back to sleep. After he went back to sleep he had a dream that the maid ended up ending her own life in the garage of the house. \n\nHe woke up in the morning a bit shaken from his dream and had a sort of sixth sense feeling. He decided to go over there and check if everything was okay. He rung the doorbell but didn't get an answer. He deiced to go around the back of the house to see if the backdoor was unlocked. The backdoor was unlocked so he went in. He entered the living room and saw the maid hanging from the chandelier. He instantly rand home and called  the police and ambulance but by that point it was too late. I remember seeing my dad after the event and he was as white as a ghost. Of course he didn't tell us what had happened as we were only young. He ended up telling us when I was about 15-16. I don't bring it up to him because he hates talking about it and gets really upset about the whole thing. We moved a little while after the last event happened. I still have no idea what happened to the next family that moved in but I seriously hope that nothing bad happened to them. I know this story is kinda hard to believe and whenever I tell people about they sometimes don't believe me but I can whole hearty swear that this happened. To this day I am convinced that the mansion was cursed.",

She takes it off every night and leaves it on her nightstand. She searched and searched for days with no avail. A few mornings later the bracelet showed up right infront of the coffee pot. My mom is an avid coffee drinker. At least 2 every morning &amp; even at night. There’s no way she missed it! \n\nAnother time, my asthma inhaler went missing. I used it the night before and put it in my sock drawer right next to my bed. (This top drawer is reachable &amp; holds snacks &amp; other things I may want in the night 😂). I got up the next morning and went to work. At this time in my life I was dealing with severe asthma that I never had an ounce of in the past. I called my mom from work (she’s always been a stay at home mom) and asked her if she could bring my inhaler to work for me because I forgot it and I couldn’t breathe. Mind you I had just filled the Rx the day before\n\nShe looks where I tell her to look. She calls back says it’s not there. I tell her “yes it is. I just used it before bed.” She looks again &amp; searches the house, nothing. Mind you my mother finds EVERYTHING. She always sees things I “can’t find”. She calls me back again saying it’s nowhere you must have it. I look again, I don’t have it. I call the pharmacy. Now, I happened to know a girl who works there. She went to school with my sister &amp; recognizes my voice. She tells me since I literally just picked one up yesterday insurance isn’t gonna cover it, but send your mom down to pick it up &amp; I’ll ring it through the register next week &amp; have you pay for it then- once insurance will cover it again. My mother picks it up, brings it to me at work. \n\nAt this particular time my grandmother was visiting from Florida &amp; she had dinner over my house with my parents. I stroll in from work at about 9pm. I walk into the kitchen where my mom had just cleared away all the dishes from dinner. I go to pull out a chair at the table &amp; I go “seriously mom….” My inhaler was in the middle of the kitchen table. My mother in shock just says “what?!” I go “it’s right here..” she says to me “Melissa,  I just ate dinner at this table. Cleared &amp; set the table before we ate, and cleared &amp; wiped it after we ate. It was not there!!”\n\nIt’s still a mystery why this stuff happened! Is that just a spirit getting a kick out of blowing our minds? 🤷🏼‍♀️",

        "text": "this still gives me chills to this day..\n\nwhen i was in 5th grade i had my first paranormal experience as long as many of my classmates. our school was known to be haunted for whatever reason as well as the highschool and the middle school. there was a tornado in my city in 1991 before i was born and it was rumored that the body’s were buried all over the city (which probably isn’t true but i just thought i would mention it) \n\ni enrolled in the elementary school because i had moved, my first day was kinda rough i could tell that i probably wouldn’t fit in but i made some great friends towards the end of the school year, we all had our own little friend groups and stayed on separate sides of the playground. but one day, we were all on the playground and one of the students in my class named kyle saw a person wandering around in the woods, he told the teacher but she didn’t believe him, so he started telling everyone of our classmates including myself that he had saw somebody in the woods. now, our school was surrounded by woods sometimes the high schoolers would smoke in the woods.\n\nbut this wasn’t the case, it was only a few minutes after kyle told everyone that he saw somebody wandering around in the woods, that the teacher would finally believe him. the look on her face.. you could tell that she had saw something that wasn’t human. you just know that look.. \n\nwe weren’t aloud on the playground for a couple days after that happened for our safety, so we would have recess in the lunchroom the teachers would bring out board games and snacks at what was supposed to be “recess time” \n\nduring recess time this girl named serena walked up to me and asked me if i had saw the person in the woods &amp; i said “no the teacher was trying to get us all in as fast as she could so i didn’t really have time to look” after that she had sat me down &amp; showed me a locket.. i didn’t really know why she was showing me a locket and how it would somehow possibly connect to the conversation until she told me that she knew the “person” outside and that “person” gave her the locket..\n\nserena didn’t really have any friends, she was pretty lonely.. during recess she would always sit by the fence by herself. \n\na few days after serena had showed me the locket we were finally aloud to go outside for recess, and here comes serena coming towards me with the locket in her hand, she told me she was missing the locket for a day or two and she found it over by the fence with a picture of a girl in it, that looked exactly like the “person” kyle saw.. \n\nfast forward to a few months later, all of my classmates are participating in a musical at the highschool, we all sit behind the curtain waiting for our turn in the musical serena, myself, and some others were left behind &amp; for some reason there’s a staircase behind the curtain that leads up to a door and as we are about to go on stage for our role, we see the same girl going up the staircase never to be seen again.. \n\ni went to the same district until 10th grade and we were constantly on that stage for many more musicals &amp; for theatre and i never saw that girl again.. \n\np.s. im sorry for any spelling &amp; grammar mistakes im typing this on my phone that hardly functions lol",

        "text": "My grandmother was diagnosed with lung cancer about 10 years ago. I was absolutely devastated as she was my favourite person on earth. She lived 3 hours away from me so I only saw her once before she died (diagnosis to her passing was quick). \n\nBefore I saw her for the last time, I decided to get rid of an old clunky jewelry box where I kept all my necklaces (which I never wear) and bought a jewelry tree instead. I went through all my pieces of jewelry and discarded stuff I didn’t want and organized the remaining pieces on the tree.\n\nDuring my last visit with her I asked her where her necklace was. I was curious because she always wore it when I was a kid but I hadn’t seen it in years (please know I wasn’t asking because I wanted it. I was just reminiscing. Not really my style anyway). She had me look all over the house in various rooms and boxes and drawers. I couldn’t find it. My aunt thought she may have given it to her niece and forgotten about it. \n\nFlash forward to the day of her funeral. I was getting ready in the bathroom and decided that maybe I would wear a necklace (which, again, I rarely do). I went to my jewelry tree and sitting right there on one of the branches was the necklace. It wasn’t even buried behind everything. It was right in front. I started welling up immediately and asked my husband if he had put it there. He looked at me dumbfounded and said no. I hadn’t even told him about the necklace or the conversation I had with my grandmother a few weeks prior so I believe him. To this day, I have no idea how it ended up with my jewelry. I wore it to the funeral that day but haven’t worn it since. I still have it. My aunt and dad can’t explain it either. Neither were at my house in the days between and neither would pull a stunt like that. \n\nIf I hadn’t just cleaned out my jewelry box I would have thought that perhaps she gave it to me a long time before and I had forgotten. But there’s no mistaking it — it was not there before she passed away.",

        "text": "I'm interested to hear from people who have experienced something like this, or have knowledge of these things.\n\nI'm 55 (f) now and I had this experience 50 years ago.  I remember it clearly.  \n\nMy mother made me go with while she went dress shopping for herself at the mall.  I didn't want to go, I would have rather stayed at home to play with my friends.  Back then we played outside all day and came home when the streetlights came on.  But, I had to go because no one else was home to watch me. (I am the youngest of 6 kids).  \n\nWe got to the mall and when I saw the huge central fountain, I begged my mom to let me stay in the court and play by the fountain.  This was before the internet, before people worried too much about serial killers and pedophiles, I was never taught about stranger danger.  My mom wasn't worried about it either, and after I promised to stay by the fountain, she went into the dress store.  \n\nI remember playing for awhile, dipping my fingers in the water, walking  around the entire fountain, and listening to the sound of the water.  I don't know why l, but suddenly I looked up and saw a man probably in his 30s with dark hair and black framed glasses in a white shirt and jeans, brown jacket.  He was about 30 feet away walking in my direction.\n\nAs soon as I saw this man, I heard a male voice say, \"Go find your mother.\" It wasn't the man in the glasses, his mouth stayed closed.  This voice came from right next to me, but there was no one there.  While I pondered what this meant and who might be speaking to me, the man in the glasses got closer.  The same voice spoke again, \"The man in the glasses wants to take a little girl in glasses. Go find your mother, NOW!\". \n\n  The word \"now\" was yelled in my ear.  So, even though I didn't understand (and still don't understand) what was happening, I got up from the edge of the fountain where I was sitting and started walking toward the store where my mother was shopping.  The man was about 10 feet away now.  Now the man in glasses spoke.  He smiled a creepy smile that scared me, chuckled and said, \"Ah you knew what I was going to do, eh?\" Then the disturbing chuckle again. This made me run into the store where I found my mom and grabbed her hand.  She was surprised to see me.  I was silent for the rest of the shopping trip.\n\nI didn't tell anyone about this until a few years ago.  I told my mom.  She thought it was Good.  I told my atheist sceptical husband, he thought I was hallucinating.  Personally, I have no clue.  I don't  know why this happened to me, why would I be warned and saved from that man and possibly another kid taken?  \n\nThe articles I have read about  4th man experiences all have an element of extreme physical distress, like people climbing Mt Everest, or trekking across Antarctica.  This was not the case for me.  \n\nLet me know what you think.",

I never knew my granddad, hi lived in the US and I live in Argentina, so I never had a relationship with him besides a handful of phone calls in my childhood. The day he passed away of old age I was in my bedroom, on the computer, when I stepped on water, I realized that there was a big puddle of water on the floor, I remember getting angry and calling my brother bc he always left open bottles of water in the floor, but when I crouched to look for the bottle under my bed (from when the water was coming) there was nothing in there. I moved my bed and realized the water was coming from where the wall meets the floor, it was coming from all over the wall that my bed was next to. I moved my things from the floor and waited, until after a couple of hours it stopped. I was skeptical for months because that very same day there were people fixing a pipe outside on my street, and I assumed that for some reason that caused the water to pour from the floor, never made the connection with my granddad's death. But a couple of months later my father told me something that scared me a little bit, my bedroom used to be my grandparents when my dad was a kid, and their bed was next to the same wall that the water pouring from, the same wall that my own fucking bed is next to.",

He was a nice ghost.\nSo I then started thinking it was my grandad, who passed away when I was 20 and he never meet my son.\n\nI asked my son what he looked like, he told me that he looked nice and was wearing all white. \nA week later I subtly put a photo of my grandad on the fridge and didn't let my son know about it. When he noticed the photo, he was yelling at me so excited saying \" mum, that's the nice ghost\" and just kept repeating it.\n\nMy grandad was also buried in a completely white suit.\n\nI cried when my son said this, because I would always say to him, I wish you could've met my grandad. He would have loved you so much.\n\nAlso we live in my grandad's house and my son's room was my grandads. I miss my grandad every day,we were very close. But this bought me so much comfort.",

When either of us would get up to see what the fuss was about she'd be standing or sitting at any of the 3 sides of her crib looking up.\n\nOne day I was holding her and walking from each framed photo of family members. I'd point to those in the pics and say, \"Who's that?\"  \nI pointed to her mom, myself, my mom, my mil, my sil, my brother, his wife. Each time she'd say her word for that person. There was a collage with a number of people, memories of the past my wife and I made and framed. There were family and friends who were no longer with us/passed on, including my father who'd passed away a decade before our daughter was born. I started pointing at people and if she didn't know them she'd look at me real fast and hold the palms of her hands up like \"I don't know.\" So I'd point to the person again and say their name. She'd do her best to repeat it.  \nIn the collage was a pic of my late father and I. I pointed to me. She said Da-da! I pointed to my father and she got all excited. She started bending her knees in my arms raising up and down giggling with the biggest smile. She raised her arms up in the air and looked at the ceiling and said loudly, \"Papa! Papa! Papa-Papa-Papa-Papa!\" She kept giggling and saying \"Papa!\"  \nI had chills and my wife was looking at us with wide eyes. I started to tear up. For one, no one had ever shown her a photo of my father. We didn't have one hanging up in the rooms where she frequented. No reason. We just didn't have very many big photos of him.  For two, she'd never said the word before. Not ever. Lastly, my brother lives halfway across the country and at that time he had only seen my daughter once. He has one daughter, but she was in college when we visited him so she'd never met our daughter. But.. My niece spent a lot of her early life around my late father before my brother relocated. \"Papa\" was what my niece called my father and he loved being called Papa.\n\nHer reaction had my wife and I thinking and admittedly hoping that maybe, just maybe, all those times we had woken up to our daughter giggling/laughing and squealing in delight, it was my late father paying her a visit.",

However, I knew something bad/weird was going to happen, I just didn't know what...\n\nSo 1am rolls around, I'm laying in bed, trying to calm myself down - NOTHING is working. No sleep. Now, what was previously shrugged off as a fear was now shifting into nothing else but serious intuition. Finally, at about 2:30... I finally get some sleep. \n\nThen suddenly, before I know it, my girlfriend wakes me up. We both hear the sound of our locked doorknob trying to be turned. I'm not saying like a breeze from the wind, no, this was FULL ON twisting and turning. Thinking it's an intruder, I immediately shout for my GF to go get me my gun (I don't actually own a gun, but I know this is a popular tactic for scaring off burglers). \n\nAnd yet, the twisting persists. Furthermore, we hear the cats in our neighborhood (there's a lot of them lol) going CRAZY, making WEIRD noises. Noises that sound like babies screeching. We turn on the outside light to \"expose them\" and let them know we know they're there. Nope, still at it.\n\nBut now, to make things even freakier, we see SHADOWS moving back and forth through our curtains, like someone walking back and forth. There's still an occaisonal twist and push at the door.\n\nI'm freaked out - full on anxiety and adrenaline - so I call the police. The police come and check out the scene, and don't find anyone or any trace that anyone was even there. But, at the very least, it did give me solace - and while even though there were still noises after they left; for some reason, I felt safe enough to go to sleep... But I still had terrible nightmares.\n\nThe next day, we go and have breakfast with our grandparents (who live in the \"main house\" , we're in the disconnected guest house) and Grandpa said he knew there was something there at 3am. The doorknob incident occurred at 4 (I remember vividly since I checked my phone to call). Our grandparents are religious and do believe in spirits, etc. - so they said it was a demon.\n\nLuckily, nothing has happened since then, but I'd love to hear y'all's thoughts on this whole thing.",

My clothes are hanging in there, and some junk on the floor of the closet. It would’ve been hard for someone to hide in there but maybe not impossible. Anyways, I decide to check the closet. I reach my hand in and feel around. I end up touching what I felt as someone’s open palm. Like the back of their hand was against the back of the closet. I touch the hand and immediately feel it flinch and pull away. As it pulls away I feel their fingers as well. At that point I feel like I caught the first person and announce, “ok I felt you! Get out!”\n\nBut then no one steps out. I say again in the dark, “cmon I felt you, you lose come on out.”\n\nAgain, silence. \n\nThen I hear my friend and her brother come into the room and ask what’s wrong? Now I’m confused, I turn on the light and look I’m through the closet but there’s no one there, just my clothes and stuff. I explain what I felt and all three of us end up feeling really freaked out. We stop playing after that and go to our parents to explain what happened. \n\nOur parents go and check but there’s nothing there. They don’t make anything more out of it. \n\nIdk what it was that I touched but I SWEAR to you, I remember it like it was yesterday, I felt a palm and fingers and felt it pull away. Skin feels recognizable. And for it to flinch and pull away felt even MORE obvious. I never had another paranormal event after that so that’s why I figured it was nothing but that was the first time I felt genuine terror for ghosts or the paranormal.",

        "text": "I've really only had one paranormal experience, I don't know exactly what it was, could be a time slip or a ghost I'm not sure but anyways here goes. \n\nIt was a few years back in the dead of winter, I live up in the frozen north of Canada (well BC, but where I live we get piles of snow). So one day there was a massive blizzard blanketing my area, it must've snowed two feet before it let up and before it did the power cut out. Probably a tree weighed down by the excessive snow broke a power line. I live in a rural area so this isn't an uncommon experience. So I gathered some candles warm clothes and blankets, a good book, and just enjoyed the complete silence of no electricity. The background hums and drones of appliances and machines that are ever present but unnoticed until all power is cut. \n\nThe day wore on into night and it looked like they wouldn't get the power back on that day. They managed to get it back on early in the morning the next day but anyways. So I'm sitting there on the couch, candles lit, it was around midnight and as I'm reading I look up and see a yellow light strobing across the trees outside and in some places through the windows and into the house. It was one of those yellow rotating hazard lights that are on heavy equipment and snowplows. Now where my house is located there is a long driveway that leads up through the trees into a clearing in the forest. I payed this light no mind as I've seen them on hundreds of snowplows before and was thankful that they were clearing my road. The only odd thing was that from the angle of the light it was clear that they had driven up my driveway, (usually they stop at the bottom of my driveway and I have to clear up from there to my house myself). At this time it had stopped snowing and I took a note of how much snow had fallen by looking out of my window onto my deck.\n\nI went to sleep, woke up the next day and was grateful that they managed to get the power back while I was sleeping. I stepped outside with my morning coffee looked at my deck and noticed that it hadn't snowed any more from when I checked it out the night before. I walked off my deck around my house to check the state of my driveway. This is when I was baffled, my driveway was untouched, there were no tracks, nothing. It was completely pristine snow at the same level of everything else. \n\nI imagine that one night during a harsh blizzard, maybe during a power outage too, a snowplow driver trying his best to keep the roads clear had an unfortunate accident, died on the job. And now when the conditions are right he comes back out doing what he did when he died, plowing the roads, not realizing that he's actually plowing nothing at all.",

I was taking a nap and I was awoken to a phone call from what the caller ID says to be Geico Insurance. I simply ignore the call. In the next minute or so, they call me again. So I just press the decline call button and proceed with my nap. Then seconds later, as my eyes are shut, I hear a loud distorted voice that seemed to be that of a woman talking. It was a very eerie distortion almost like static on a TV with no signal. It was extremely loud and piercing almost as if it was coming from straight inside of my head. As soon as I heard this, I would attempt to open my eyes and look around or check my phone to see where this was coming from (keep in mind I was still practically awake and not even a minute into any sort of deep sleep after being awoken by the first call). However, I was somehow in a complete state of sleep paralysis? I could not move or even open my eyes whatsoever for the whole duration of hearing that noise. Once it was over, I was finally able to move and open my eyes to grab my phone. Then seconds later, I get the notification that I have a new voicemail from Geico of course. I listen to the voicemail and it just sounds like a regular voice of a woman asking if I was interested in their insurance etc... Now I'm left wondering what could of caused me to be in such a paralyzed state while hearing that distorted noise? Could it have been that the phone signal of the voicemail somehow got picked up first through my brain in such a raw indecipherable way that caused me to be completely immobile?\n\nTLDR; Incoming phone call gave me temporary paralysis.",

        "text": "My family and I (Mom, Dad, and Sister) moved into this house when I was 6. When we first moved I HATED it here. I was constantly scared, seeing shadows, hearing weird stuff &amp; once even jumped out of the shower with shampoo all over my head &amp; ran downstairs crying to my mom because I felt/ heard somebody breathe next to my ear. I would have friends over &amp; when we were left alone in the house we would also hear things &amp; be scared. Almost the whole home is wood flooring &amp; we’d hear creaking like somebody was walking around. Throughout this time in our “new” home, I found out later that my parents were hearing music coming from the attic while they were in bed. Piano music.. sometimes radio music. My father is someone who takes no shit &amp; I’ve never seen him be scared of anything. So he’d walk right up &amp; pull down the stairs to the attic to check it out. As soon as he got to the top the music would stop. He checked the whole attic there was nothing up there that could produce music. (My mother told me this years later as she knew I was afraid enough). So in my high school years, I would go to bed and lock my door at night. Stupid I know, but my dad wasn’t one to knock &amp; I was often doing things I shouldn’t be doing in there. One night I woke up in the middle of the night (mind you, I’m a person you have to shake to wake) to my doorknob being violently shaken in it’s locked state. Seeing the hour I jumped out of bed &amp; opened the door immediately assuming it was Dad and something was wrong. Nobody is there. I go back to sleep thinking I must be dreaming or crazy or something. This happened a total of 2-3 times over a fairly large span of years. I’ve also had knocks on my door in the middle of the night/ early morning. My response is usually “ya?” Nobody enters. I open the door, nobody there. The last isolated incident I can remember was in 2016. I was working at a salon &amp; the owners daughter (who I became quite close to) died of an overdose. Our birthdays were 3 days apart and we’d always celebrate together at the salon. She had just passed in January &amp; it was her birthday night. It was late, 1-2am. I was on the toilet in my bathroom &amp; happened to be thinking about her. I said out loud “Happy Birthday Bonnie” &amp; BOOM start hearing wild piano music above me in the attic. I freaked out &amp; ran downstairs- woke up my mom (who was sleeping on the couch bc my parents no longer slept in the same bed) this is when she told me about the music when I was a kid. So 2 weekends ago there was nothing good on TV on Sunday (surprise surprise) so I put on “Unexplained”. For those of you who don’t know it’s a ghost hunting show with qualified people doing the hunting (ie: paranormal investigators &amp; mediums) I kindof like the thrill of being scared watching stuff. But I don’t like being scared in my own home. My mom &amp; I watched for a few hours until I went to pick up food. I took her car bc it was easier. There was this water bottle on her back seat swishing around &amp; making noise in the car. I had been in her car the day before running hours worth of errands &amp; did not notice this at all. I felt a weird presence/ sacredness while I drove. I told myself I’m just creeping myself out bc of the show. That night I go to bed. All good, not thinking about anything scary. At 9am I wake up to 4 soft knocks on my bedroom door. I assume it’s mom &amp; say “ya?” Nothing. I go back to sleep for an hour or 2. Wake up later and ask her if she knocked on my door this morning. Answer is no. So the very next night I go to sleep. I have this old Harman/ Kardon speaker &amp; base set in my bedroom. Its 4am &amp; the thing is humming. Like loud &amp; creepy.. hum…hummmm hummmmmm each one the tone sounds like it’s more echoey &amp; closer. I quickly turn on my phones flash light… it stops immediately. I’ve grown older in this house &amp; for a very long time I stopped feeling scared. Was watching that show &amp; having odd things come back to light the spirits own way of telling me they’re still here? I don’t know.. rant over.",

My grandma was next to her so both of them saw the same thing. \n\nOf course my mother got scared and my grandma told her to cover me with a blanket and stay calm while she grabbed something (maybe her things to go to a hospital).

Keep in mind that when they saw the hole, I wasn’t crying or anything, just doing normal baby stuff.\n\nAlso, my mom and grandma are quite the skeptics and do not believe in anything paranormal, so no biases here as far as I know.\n\nWhat do you guys think it means?",

Never saw any since then.\n\nWhen we moved to our next place, (the one I live in now) we have a sliding door, during my first night this door slid, it was a very scary encounter, I know that these weren't hallucinations, even when I watched these moved and I heard it. \nAfter my first night there nothing really happened however I was always scared of our current place, especially during the night as if something or someone was lingering in our bathroom which is next to the toilet, or it followed me to the living room and the kitchen.\nI was also scared to sleep in my room, as if something was in the corner lingering watching me, I always needed to have my covers over my head even when it was summer, I always felt like I was being watched.\n\nOnce a spatula fell down from a pot that was quite large.\n\nIt all stopped 3 years ago, I changed my bed position and now I feel safe, I can sleep without covers, however sometimes I feel like theres something outside of my window however it is very rare. \n\nMy pet was barking at nothing but probably at some ghost or bad spirit.\n\nThere are more encounters, many more. I'll write some later.\nI hope that you guys enjoyed these stories, these are all stories that I experienced.",

        "text": "This happened to me roughly over a year ago and I still don’t know what to make of it. Apologies in advance for the lengthy post, but I want to be thorough.\n\n**For context:** I sleep with the lights out in complete darkness. The only minimal amount of light (red) in my room is from my electronic clock on my nightstand. I’ve also had numerous encounters with the super natural, but nothing like this. In the past, I’ve mostly seen relatives who are no longer with us or other ‘human’-like spirits/entities. Another detail which will be important later is that I’m currently writing a fantasy/supernatural book I’ve been working on since High School.\n\nSo, I had just woken up and rolled over on my side to check the time on my bedside clock; it was a little past 3:30AM. I sat there for a minute, unable to get back to sleep. The next time I went to look at the clock, I saw something crouching beside my bed.\n\nIt was a mostly black figure with a grey-ish hue to it, was very tall (I’d say about 6 1/2- 7 feet if it stood up), and long fingers that somewhat came to a point. It had no distinctive facial features or other definitive shape to it. The figure slowly moved up beside me on my bed, putting one arm around me behind my head and moving the other over towards my chest. At this point, I had rolled on to my back and tried to just stay still and hope it went away. It didn’t. \n\nThe figure kept one arm wrapped around me and started stroking my face and lips with its other hand. The side of my face felt harm and like there was a gentle caress, but it wasn’t like feeling a real person’s touch- not like skin on skin. Then, it leaned into my ear, still stroking my face, and said, “You’re taking too long to finish my book.” The voice didn’t sound either male or female, but rather just had a soft, monotone sound to it. \n\nAt that point, I was eerily creeped out and had enough. I didn’t get any aggressive or negative vibes from this thing, I just didn’t know what the heck was going on. So, I pushed it’s ‘hand’ away and tried to- don’t laugh- bite it when the figure wouldn’t move away. It didn’t feel like I necessarily made contact with anything. It was kind of like trying to push two repulsive ends of magnets together. However, it shook its hand, as if in pain, from me trying to bite it. After that, it slowly crouched back down and just disappeared into nothing.\n\nThis was the first and last time anything like this ever happened to me. **Thoughts?** I didn’t get the feeling of having any connection to this entity, not like I have when I’ve seen loved ones who’ve passed. Don’t believe it was sleep paralysis either because I was pretty much wide awake and could move when I wanted to. What makes me feel uneasy about this is that it was such a dark figure, the weird touching of my face/lips, and eerie comment about me writing a book. I don’t know what to make of this.",

We were about to cross the road on zebra, which is on roundabout with usual moderate traffic, and well lighted. It is urban area.\n\nDiagonally to the left is church with smaller green garden and bushes around which somewhat block the view of the church entrance.\n\nThere in front of the church like 20 meters away from us I spotted girl around 8-9 years standing in white dress, in something like a white nightgown. But dress was torn apart, it had holes in it. Girl had arms down hanging still next to the body. She had long hair also hanging and she was looking down and straight. She was not looking at us but in front of church entrance toward out (the road) and building on the other side. I had a thought that it is poor girl from wartime.\n\nThen my friend interrupted me by jumping toward the road which was on our right. He was on my left, so closer to the church. He mumbled something out of surprise. I forced myself to be very alert and realized what just may be happening and I said to him: \"I will not say anything now, but you tell me what is it?\" And he replied: \"There is a girl in white dress. I saw it. That is what scared me.\" And I was like \"Omg, I saw her too! But why are you afraid, she is just standing there, and there are people around...\"\n\nThen while we were crossing the road we were looking towards that church entrance and no one was there.\n\nAnd we just went forward as usual, pass the bushes and little road that leads to church entrance, looking towards church and saw nothing. Then we continued walking home like nothing happened.\n\nThat friend few years later, after already finished university, went to study to become catholic priest and he is priest today. At that time he was still not sure if he should be priest.",

        "text": "It was about a month ago on Saturday, I got off my bus from work to buy some beer from a large superstore, Nothing out of the ordinary. There's 3 ways to walk home, 2 down main roads and the quickest being down an old wooded path that used to be a Victorian railroad track. I live in a rural area in England so the track is surrounded by fields.  \n\n\nWalking down there I heard a group of Owls hooting away so I thought it would be cool to record some audio since usually it's quiet down there, walking further down I saw the moon through the trees and noticed it had an eerie reddish tint to it, so naturally I brought up my phone to take a pic. But in order to do that I had to switch my torch off, So there I was standing in darkness trying to get a clear picture of the Moon when I heard something solid and heavy fall from a tree behind me. It sounded like it fell from the top and hit branches on the way down until landing with an audible heavy thud when hitting the ground.  \n\n\nI'm actually a pretty skeptical bloke who doesn't scare easy but I admit it startled me and I walked straight home at a quick pace. It's a very old track that stretches for miles (Thankfully I only have to walk down a tiny stretch) and I have heard stories of people hanging themselves down there, could it have been a ghost? A petrified Owl? A peeping Tom dropping his camera from a tree? I have no idea.",
