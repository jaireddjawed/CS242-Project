        "text": "Good day, DH.\n\nIt recently occurred to me that it's been a while since we sat down and had a good meta chat. I'd just like to check in and see how things are going. Ah, but before you start a comment or concern regarding the \"quality vs. quantity\" issue, we're not talking about that today. I'd like to know about everything *except* that. Please note that what is voiced here may or may not see its way into policy change. Even if we do decide to make changes, it will undoubtedly be slow. So let's all relax, throw some words around, and see how it goes. I'll get us started.\n\n**What is the \"Quality vs. Quantity\" issue you mentioned, and why aren't we talking about it?**\n\nThe \"Quality vs. Quantity\" issue is fundamentally a problem of what people want from DepthHub, and whether they understand how DepthHub actually works. The meat of the issue is that we have *lots* of people here (we just broke 120k, making us the 89th largest subreddit) and with many people comes many desires. Some of our readers want only the most hardcore, in-depth, scientific information (quality), and simply won't be satisfied by anything less. Some of our readers don't mind if the content is only mildly interesting (quantity), as long as there's a lot of it (what else are you going to do at work?). However, most of our readers fall somewhere in-between, preferring a slower&amp;mdash;but not stagnant&amp;mdash;amount of content, while still retaining that spark of knowledge that leaves us feeling refreshed and informed.\n\nWe are not talking about this issue because it has been done to death. We've talked, and talked, and talked some more, and have realized that this particular issue cannot be solved with normal rules. For those who don't know, the decision is that moderators have complete oversight over all submissions. This is the end of the story; please do not leave comments here about it.\n\n**Hey, what happened to my (completely inaccurate) submission that had good discussion on DepthHub?**\n\nOur current policy is that the most egregious offenders to science and knowledge, i.e., posts which are demonstrably *wrong*, will be deleted no matter how many comments they have on DepthHub. However, if the post is more up in the air, and the fierce debate that ensues on DepthHub is both respectful and lively, we're apt to keep the post in.\n\nThis is definitely up for discussion. Should we keep \"bad\" posts if the \"good\" DepthHub comments become their own source of information?\n\n**Can you *please* do something about the active/visited link colors?**\n\nAbsolutely. We have heard your pleas, and we are definitely open to changing the link colors. Please let us know which colors you think would work best.\n\n**tl;dr: How is DepthHub doing? Please don't talk about \"Quantity vs. Quality\" (see above).**",
