        "text": "Microsoft's Edge browser's Read Aloud function for Japanese is particularly impressive. It sounds a lot clearer than Windows' built in TTS voices for Japanese (which are not bad, but they sound like an AM radio).\n\nIf you're up to intermediate/advanced level and are trying to read a lot of Japanese content online, using the Read Aloud together with your Japanese dictionary extension of choice (I like 10ten), it's quite a killer combination! \n\nMy reading is already pretty fast, given I know Mandarin so Kanji is not a big problem, but I often don't know how the kanji is pronounced, and that's where the Read Aloud function comes in really handy. And it's also cool to let it read in the background so that you can listen to websites as well.\n\nI know Chrome has similar functionality via 3rd party extensions, but Edge's version is probably using their Azure-based TTS functionality on the cloud, so it's seamless. You can also pause and resume the reading, especially when you want to look up words and stuff.\n\nJust thought I'd mention this interesting resource so that you can try it for yourself and see if it helps in your learning workflow/immersion.\n\nEd",

I try not to go too hard on daily study because I know burnout can be a real problem for me if I grind for hours a day and still only see marginal returns in my comprehension. However, I have recently also added in wanikani to help me hammer home the specific writing/typing aspect of Japanese as well. Then for grammar I‚Äôve used Japanese ammo with misa‚Äôs beginner n5/n4. I feel like I want to be able to set my next goal to be able to watch an anime, probably one I already know at least a bit with no subs. But the thing is as I am now visiting Japan for the first time I‚Äôve realized my listening SUCKS. To elaborate while I have comparatively no problems talking at least the bare basics in Japanese, I have found that understanding a response even if also relatively basic I seem to have very little to no comprehension. What are some good resources and techniques to fill in this gap in my study? Right now the easiest stuff I can find due to previous study would maybe be  Japanese ammo with misa n5/n4 listening. But even that I seem to have very little comprehension so idk if that‚Äôs normal or if there is something even more basic. \nThank you in advance for any advice!",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/101jpm3/three_year_study_update/",
        "text": "I first started learning Japanese from nothing on New Years day, 2020, so I just reached the three year mark and thought I should post another update.\n\nThe main difference this year is that I've been practicing reading more, and it does feel like it has gotten easier over time. I also took the practice N3 test and while it is always a slog, it does feel like I could actually pass it now for the first time. The one disappointment is speaking - I haven't made any progress learning to speak Japanese and still have no idea what to do there.\n\n\n**JLPT**\n[Six months ago](https://forum.language-learners.org/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=12230&amp;p=211077#p211077), I (re)took the practice 2012 N3 test and did badly enough that I ragequit and decided that the JLPT is stupid and artificial and I should stop worrying about it and just do what I feel like without measuring my progress that way. However, in honor of reaching the three year mark studying Japanese, I decided to spend the day taking [the practice 2018 N3 test](https://www.jlpt.jp/e/samples/sampleindex.html) (the one I hadn't taken before) anyway to judge my progress. The results were actually relatively good:\n\n\nVocabulary: 31/35 (time: 29/30m)\nReading and Grammar: 32/39 (time: 106/70m)\n* Grammar: 18/23 (46m)\n* Reading: 14/16 (58m)\nListening: 16/28\n* Task-based comprehension: 3/6\n* Point-based comprehension: 2/6\n* Summary: 2/3\n* Utterance expressions: 4/4\n* Quick response: 5/9\n\nThe big surprise was the **grammar** section. I've taken practice JLPT tests many times over the years, at N5, N4, and N3 levels, and every single time, I've been killed by the grammar section. For comparison, when I took the other N3 test six months ago, I only got 12/23. This time, it was still very difficult and I had to guess a lot, but I somehow did much better. Perhaps all my reading and Japanese study has rubbed off into somewhat more subconscious grammar ability.\n\nI also improved in reading, which makes sense, since I've been studying it so much. When I took the other practice N3 test last year, I got 13/16, so it might not seem like a huge improvement score-wise. But it's worth noting that a year ago, I spent 81 minutes on it, whereas it only took me 58 minutes this time (of course, different tests aren't directly comparable, but it's useful as at least a ballpark demonstration of progress).\n\nI've also improved on the vocab section (compared to 28/33 a year ago and 23/33 six months ago). As usual, I had to guess a lot towards the end, but a surprising number of my guesses ended up being right. And I do think that a year of drilling vocab on JPDB, Wanikani, etc. has helped.\n\nAs for listening, that's always been my weakest section apart from grammar, and today was no exception. It is odd how my relative performance on the different subsections changed a lot. For example, I got a perfect score on Utterance Expressions, usually my worst, and did worse on the ones that I did well on before. But I think a lot of that is just randomness. I do wish I knew a way to train to be better on JLPT listening sections. You'd think I'd be better than this, given the sheer amount of time I've spent listening to Japanese over the years.\n\n\nOne caveat is that I'm not exactly replicating the official test conditions. I took each section of the test over the course of the day with many breaks in between, unlike the real test, and I took my time to see how I could theoretically do when it is just testing knowledge and I'm not under time pressure. On the Reading and Grammar section, I took more than the actual time allotted, which means that if this were a real test, I would have had to just go more quickly and/or guess on some, which might have reduced my score. But as far as using a practice test to measure progress, I think this is more useful anyway.\n\n\n**Vocab**\n\nThis year, I started using **JPDB** to study vocabulary. It takes a while to get used to and is often frustrating, and in fact I went so far as to ragequit and delete all my decks back in October, before starting over again. But I have learned a fair bit over the year, and I'm currently doing 10 new cards a day.\n\nI've also continued doing Wanikani, although lately, I haven't been putting much time into it and instead have been focusing on JPDB. I finally burned through most of my review backlog on WK and went from level 46 to 48. \n\nI speedran Wanikani in my first year and hit level 60 in under a year, but didn't learn much at the higher levels. In May 2021, [I decided to unburn everything and go through it a second time and reset to level 46](https://community.wanikani.com/t/scaling-the-6218-review-wall/51355). Ever since then, I've been slowly working my way through the giant review mountain. One nice thing is how my greatly increased Japanese knowledge over the years means that there are quite a few words I know well now, so WK is easier than it it was the first time around.\n\n**Reading**\n\nThis year, I started trying to read stories on [Shousetsuka ni Narou](https://syosetu.com/]Shousetsuka ni Narou). I spent several months struggling through [„ÅÑ„Å§„ÇÇÈÄö„Çä„ÅÆÊó•Â∏∏„Åß„ÄÅ„ÄÅÂêõ„Åã„Çâ„Åô„Çå„Å∞](https://ncode.syosetu.com/n5215gi), the first Japanese web novel I've ever finished. \n\nMore recently, I've read most of [„Åµ„Çè„Åµ„ÇèÊó•Ë®ò](https://ncode.syosetu.com/n4438m/) with somewhat less struggle. I recommend it as a native Japanese story that is relatively easy to read, but it might also be my slowly improving Japanese skills kicking in.\n\nI've also continued slowly going through Satori Reader, aiming to read one chapter a day, and have now gotten through many of the stories on the site.\n\n\n**Speaking**\n\nBesides reading, my other goal for the year was to develop basic speaking skills. Unfortunately this one was a completely failure. As mentioned in my previous update, I planned to use Italki to develop speaking skills, starting in August this year. After considerable procrastination, I finally did do two trial lessons on Italki, but they didn't go well, and now I'm at a loss for what to do. Any suggestions?\n\nI think my main problem is that I have a very low tolerance for making mistakes or not knowing how to say something, which makes it difficult to start speaking. Another major frustration I found in Italki is that I didn't even know how to express my wishes or explain what I wanted to the teacher. And I also have the problem that when I'm not confident about how to say something (which is most of the time), I tend to just awkwardly trail off or just stay silent.\n\nSometimes I wonder whether it would be better to start by focusing on writing and getting that corrected by natives, but I'm not sure how well that would go, and it doesn't directly help with speaking. Does anyone have any experience with this?\n\n**Podcasts**\n\nThis year, I continued listening repeatedly to Noriko and Utaco's podcasts in the background while out walking, cooking, eating, etc., just like I've been doing for several years now. I'm not sure how much it actually helps, but I suppose it can't hurt. By the way, does anyone have suggestions for other podcasts I should try? I've been meaning to add some to the rotation for a long time, but never gotten around to finding any new ones I like.\n\n**Anime**\n\nThis year, I continued watching Anime with English subtitles, mostly for entertainment. I watch it for subtitles so I can actually understand everything and enjoy the show, and thus it is of dubious educational value, but I do try to recognize bits of the Japanese dialog in between reading subtitles, and I do occasionally learn things this way.\n\nFor example, I first encountered the word Ë®±„Åô (yurusu) on Wanikani back in my first year, where it was taught as \"to allow/permit\". However, while watching anime, I noticed that it often sounded like they were saying it when the subtitles showed them saying stuff like \"I'll never forgive you\" and I deduced that it also refers to forgiveness. And thus, I was able to correctly guess vocab #20 on the practice JLPT N3 due to knowing that it means \"to forgive\".\n\nAnyway, since I've watched a ton of anime this year (Den-noh Coil, Komi Can't Communicate, Glass Mask, Kotaro Lives Alone, Blue Period, Forest of Piano, The Orbital Children, Steins;Gate, The Promised Neverland, Romantic Killer, Children of the Whales, Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai, and possibly others I've forgotten about), I thought it would make sense to offer my recommendations.\n\nI recommend **Komi Can't Communicate**, **The Promised Neverland** (s1 only - I've heard s2 is terrible), and **Romantic Killer**. Dishonorable Mention goes to Forest of Piano, which is boring and I recommend avoiding it.",

I personally prefer BookLive\n\n**// BookLive**\n\nBookLive Pros:\n\n&gt;Has 200 highlights as opposed to BookWalker's 50  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Reselects entire highlight  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Displays book percent while reading  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Has more extensive customization in terms of night mode  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Easy to purchase books on mobile\n\nBookLive Cons:\n\n&gt;Sometimes sign in with AppleID doesn't work on my mobile browser  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Trying to find new books to read within BookLive itself is pretty terrible. The categories don't make much sense and sorting by popularity seems to mean very little\n\n**// BookWalker**\n\nBookWalker Pros:\n\n&gt;Can have highlights within highlights  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Displays in \"pages\" (although not accurate to material)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Ë™≠„ÅøÊîæÈ°å: Pay a monthly fee to read as many manga or novels as you want from a pretty broad selection\n\nBookWalker Cons:\n\n&gt;It's difficult to select multiple kanji that have furigana over them (selection in general is a pain)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It keeps taking me back to further along in the book than I had read to  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I can't get my books to show up on my computer browser? Not sure what's happening there  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Can't see what percent you're through the book without closing book  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I can't seem to get new recs for Ë™≠„ÅøÊîæÈ°å? Maybe it only activates when finishing a book?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I have to switch device languages on my mobile device to view their Japanese store  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Ë™≠„ÅøÊîæÈ°å is like 80% light novels, and while I appreciate them a lot as a part of my reading catalogue, they're not really what I like the most\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**// Other Notes**\n\n1. BookWalker is ostensibly more directed at light novels, shinbungei, and manga\n2. BookLive has slightly more books\n3. They both have Ë©¶„ÅóË™≠„Åø (try before you read) on pretty much everything\n4. Both can be used outside of Japan\n5. There's also honto.jp. I've never used them for ebooks myself, but I love them for buying physical books because they put everything in one box, saving on shipping.\n6. Both have mobile apps (iOS, probably Android?) and can be accessed from your browser\n7. On iOS, you may have to have a Japanese AppleID (which is easy to make and honestly very useful if you don't already have one)",

Earlier I just used to practice some conversation scripts and thats it, but its also very important to be able to speak the language too, but I dont have anyone to practice my conversational skills. I wanted to know if anyone would be interested in practicing conversational skills on a daily basis, I have been learning alone for a long time now it would be nice if I have someone who also want to practice their Japanese, If you are interested we can use skype or discord as a means to communicate. Also, Happy New year !",

        "text": "I've been cooking this one up since March and unfortunately I missed Jan and Feb because I only got the idea to start tracking my immersion hours late into the year, but anyway I've been (more or less lazily) tracking how much time I spend doing Japanese stuff like consuming media, etc for the entire year and I thought it would be cool to look at my progress in 2022, things I've done, things I've enjoyed, and all that jazz. \n\nFor time tracking I use [this app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aloggers.atimeloggerapp) on Android and I don't really do it too zealously, I just start it when I begin something and end it afterwards, if I take short breaks (toilet) I don't bother pausing it but longer breaks (baby crying) I do. So the numbers don't have to be accurate to a T. \n\n## Summary (tl;dr)\n\nIn 2022, I spent 1232 hours and 35 minutes doing the following: \n\nMedia | Time\n-|------------------------\nVideogames | 680 hours and 35 minutes\nVisual Novels | 165 hours and 12 minutes\nManga | 147 hours and 9 minutes\nAnime | 55 hours and 37 minutes\nLivestreams | 27 hours and 2 minutes\nAnki | 36 hours and 51 minutes\n\nFor a more accurate monthly breakdown I have [this graph](https://i.imgur.com/kLsZ0ci.png), and also [this graph](https://i.imgur.com/aEBc7Vh.png) with videogames removed because I spend too much time playing videogames and it skewed the graph. For a total sum monthly breakdown there's also [this one graph](https://i.imgur.com/dkWOYt7.png).\n\nA few interesting highlights that stand out to me looking at the monthly breakdown:\n\n - In March most of my time was dominated by Elden Ring, and it caused a huge spike in my average monthly videogame time\n - Between April and May my Visual Novel time went up as I got super hooked on the VN Yu-No (it's really good!) and I played it over Golden Week almost 24/7 until I 100%'d it\n - I'm not much of a VN guy but the other spike in August comes from 100%ing Anonymous;Code, another really good VN I enjoyed\n - Besides one outlier (November, which I spent at my in-laws just reading a lot while I was taking care of my newborn son), I seem to fluctuate between Manga and Light Novel periods where I'll really get into a Manga series and dedicate most of my time reading that (and not reading books), or vice-versa I will get into a very interesting book and stop reading manga. You can see when the light novel bar goes up, the manga bar goes down, and vice-versa. \n\n## Manga\n\nI track the manga I own, read, and want to read in my own spreadsheet so I have some more detailed stats on how many manga I read in 2022 (including before March). My [total manga bookshelf](https://i.imgur.com/jfukWeN.png) summary shows more complete stats, not unique to 2022, but to drill down a bit more:\n\n - I read a total of 99 volumes (so close to 100!)\n - I read a total of 113 Shounen Jump chapters (I only recently started following a few series there in November)\n\nSome highlights of manga series I started in 2022 that I really enjoyed:\n - „É´„É™„Éâ„É©„Ç¥„É≥ - My #1 manga of 2022, too bad the series only has one volume and it's on hiatus)\n - Èùí„ÅÆÂ≥∂„Å®„Å≠„Åì‰∏ÄÂåπ - Really nice slice of life in the inaka with a lot of hiroshima dialect, very cute\n - ‰∫∫Èñì„ÅÆ„ÅÑ„Å™„ÅÑÂõΩ - Kinda sci-fi/horror-ish post-apocalyptic story of a little girl and a golem, living in a mysterious world of machines\n - ÊñáÂåñ„ÅÆÂÆà„Çä‰∫∫ - Cute one-shot story from Shounen Jump+ about a post-apocalyptic world where monsters dominate the surface and humans have to venture on the surface wearing mecha suits to find \"culture\" \n - Â∞ëÂπ¥„ÅÆ„Ç¢„Éì„Çπ - Read this if you want to get depressed\n - ÂæíËä± - Short (3 volume) psychological \"detective\" story\n\n## Videogames\n\nUnfortunately I don't track which games I play/finish that accurately so my memory of 2022 is a bit spotty (I'll try to do better next year), but I have a few games that I played (not necessarily finished) in Japanese in 2022 off the top of my head in no particular order:\n\n - Triangle Strategy \n - Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order\n - Soul Hackers 2 \n - ÈñÉ„ÅÆËªåË∑°ÔºöÊîπ - Thors Military Academy 1204 (This is my highlight game of 2022, and thanks to it I'm now playing through the entire kiseki series)\n - Á©∫„ÅÆËªåË∑°SC (currently playing this)\n - Xenoblade 1: DE\n - Xenoblade 3\n - Stranger of Paradise \n - Yakuza 0\n - Yakuza 2 (had already played 1)\n - Dragon Quest XI Offline \n - Pokemon Shining Pearl\n - Final Fantasy Crisis Core Reunion\n - Elden Ring\n\nI know I definitely missed a lot, but these are the ones I remember. \n\n## Visual Novels\n\nI'm not a huge Visual Novel kinda guy, but there's at least a couple that I really enjoyed, as for the rest I usually just start reading one for a few days then put it on hold and come back to it months later. I'm very inconsistent with them.\n\nMy VN highlights for 2022 are: Yu-No and Anonymous;Code. I 100%'d both of these and I could not stop reading them all the way through (which is rare for me with VNs). As for others that I haven't finished but I'm still currently reading:\n\n - Eustia \n - Muv Luv Unlimited \n - ‰∏ÄÁ∑í„Å´Ë°å„Åç„Åæ„Åó„Çá„ÅÜÈÄù„Åç„Åæ„Åó„Çá„ÅÜÁîü„Åç„Åæ„Åó„Çá„ÅÜ\n\n## Light Novels / Books\n\nFor books I use [bookmeter](https://bookmeter.com/users/1282676) although my account has both books and manga so it's not super reliable. The books I read in 2022 are:\n\n - The Wheel of Time volume 1 (yeah, re-read it in Japanese. The translation is not that good, I wouldn't recommend)\n - Kuma Bear LN series vol 8 to 12\n - (audiobook) ÁµÇÊú´„Å™„Å´„Åó„Å¶„Åæ„Åô„ÅãÔºü Âøô„Åó„ÅÑ„Åß„Åô„ÅãÔºü Êïë„Å£„Å¶„ÇÇ„Çâ„Å£„Å¶„ÅÑ„ÅÑ„Åß„Åô„ÅãÔºü (SukaSuka) vol 1 \n - Slayers vol 1\n - Èπø„ÅÆÁéã vol 1 (I wanted to read the full series, but volume 1 was really boring so I dropped volume 2)\n - Êßç‰Ωø„ÅÑ„Å®„ÄÅÈªíÁå´ vol 1\n\nFor a total of: 9 books + 1 audiobook\n\n## Anime\n\nI use [annict](https://annict.com/@Morg) to track the anime I watch. I usually just pick one or two series per season and I drop a lot of them anyway. I used to be big into anime but in the last few years my interest has waned. \n\nI'll just say that, surprisingly, the highlight series for the year for me has been Lycoris Recoil which I enjoyed way more than I thought I would. \n\n## How much did my Japanese improve?\n\nComing into 2022 I was already feeling more comfortable with Japanese input but I still felt a bit careful about whether or not something was \"at my level\". In 2022 I read a lot of stuff that I'd have never imagine I'd be able to, like the Wheel of Time book or Elden Ring which use fairly complicated Japanese. Ending my 2022 I feel very confident now I can just jump into something and not feel uncomfortable doing it. Not everything is easy yet, but at least I'm confident I can \"take it\", which to me has been a huge confidence booster after 5 (now 6 I guess?) years of studying. \n\nMy output, however, is still lagging behind. I need to spend more time in 2023 doing that. \n\n## Plans for 2023\n\nI'm not big into doing new year's resolutions since I find them more stressful than anything, however I usually write down a few thoughts of \"wouldn't it be nice if...\" and see how it goes. Last year I wanted to read a few books that I listed in my list of read books so I'm happy to say I achieved that goal at least (I did drop Èπø„ÅÆÁéã though, but „Åó„Çá„ÅÜ„Åå„Å™„ÅÑ). \n\nFor 2023, my general goals would be to finish the entire ËªåË∑° videogame series, and the rest of the „Åè„Åæ„ÇØ„ÉûÁÜä„Éô„Ç¢ volumes I'm missing (from 13 to 20). Also I'd like to not fall behind on the Á©çË™≠ of my manga library and try to keep the gap between \"read manga\" and \"owned manga\" as small as possible. I'm also very much looking forward to Final Fantasy XVI.\n\n----\n\nWhy am I posting this? I don't know, I just felt like sharing and I hope it can inspire others as well. I would have never imagined 5 years ago that I'd be able to do all of this in Japanese, so it feels good to be reminded of how far we've come and how far we can still go.\n\nAnd what about you?",

However, I have not been able to find any with Japanese subtitles. When I say classic Japanese films, I mean films like \"Seven Samurai\" and \"Harakiri\". I tried using a VPN to rent them on Amazon Japan, but then it asked for a Japanese address or credit card. Then other places like Criterion Channel have classic Japanese movies, but they all just have English subtitles. Does anyone know where I can find movies like this with Japanese subtitles or at least the Japanese scripts of these movies?",

That was pretty easy to discover through a quick google search.\n\nBut I have not been able to figure out what the pattern here is. Sometimes i feel like I‚Äôll hear the „Åß„Åô after „ÅÑadjectives be half swallowed so that „ÅÑ„Åü„ÅÑ„Åß„Åôbecomes „ÅÑ„Åü„ÅÑ„Åô. It might even be „ÅÑ„Åü„ÅÑ„Å£„Åô but I don‚Äôt have the most well-trained ears.\n\nI don‚Äôt really intend on using this structure because it seems more like slang.
