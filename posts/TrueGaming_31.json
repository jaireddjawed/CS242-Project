        "text": "I really enjoy games where you explore a big world while getting better at the game's main mechanics. But some of them emphasize main story lines that shift my focus away from what I really like about them. This can be seen in games like the Witcher 3. When I first picked up this game I said all the same things other people do (great storytelling, well built world, beautiful graphics) but I had a ton of trouble getting into the game.\n\n\nInitially I thought it was because the combat wasn't great, but I've happily played games with worse combat mechanics all the way through. The real problem was that there is so much urgency to find Ciri that I needed to make it a priority instead of fully exploring the world. BUT, then I found Gwent, which is a pretty easy to grasp card-based mini game that really opened up the entire world for me. I practically forgot about the main storyline and chose to make Gwent my priority (I will usually complete the main story of a game before doing side stuff, but this was one of the only times I did the opposite). \n\n\nIn order to get better cards, you can either buy them, earn them as quest prizes, or beat someone with a rare card. This means that you need to explore the world if you want to increase the power of your deck. There are also high stake games and tournaments to go to. And i absolutely love it. I used Gwent as a way to advance through the world at my own pace. \n\n\nI like to compare this to what Pokémon does. I haven't played any of the newer games (last one I beat was ruby) but it was always about becoming the best Pokémon trainer, which can be considered urgent but not nearly as important as finding your long lost kinda daughter. This low-stakes backdrop allowed me to enjoy the game in a way that was more relaxing; yes you want to progress but at the same time there isn't a story arch that is trying to pull you in a different direction.\n\nWhat are some other games that emphasize exploration in a more low-urgency way? I would love to find more games like Pokémon and the Gwent part of the Witcher 3",

        "text": "Both in my opinion have their strengths and weaknesses. Quicksaves can reduce a lot of stress due to not have to redo the same section of the game over and over again. That is also it's weakness however. It can also remove tension from failure. An example would be in Rainbow Six 3. If I could quicksave, missions would be extremely easy as I would reload everytime an enemy catches me off guard. Since the game never saves during a mission, there is so much suspense when nearing the end of the mission as I know only one bullet will send me back to the beginning. Save techniques can really change how games are played (Dark Souls) so I'm wondering which is the best option.",

        "text": "Lately I played a game which is coming out next month for Nintendo Switch: it's called \"Sushi Striker - The Way of Sushido\" the game is a fairly simple puzzle game, where you match as many sushi plates in the same color as you can. Nothing out of the ordinary but there are little tweaks which offer the game some tactical aspects and depth to the gameplay ... theoretically.\n\nWell the problem is, the game has like any other game I played in the last years a mandatory rpg-progression-system. Where you can extend your health bar, deal more damage, fill your special bar much faster and whatsoever.\nThis is contrary to the overlaying system of the game which is a puzzle game: it's about testing your reflexes and your ability to think fast, overseeing stressful situations.\n\nI have trouble with such RPG-systems because most of the time it leads to balancing issues, there is no way for the player to know if the level is high enough to have a chance against incoming challenges. But much more often rpg-systems allow you to ridiculously overpower yourself to make the actual part of the game where you play the game (asides from all the number crunching stuff) an unexciting cakewalk.\n\nI bummers me a lot to intentionally tone myself down and denying rewards because I know that it screws with the balancing of the game.\nOne good example is \"Shantae: Half Genie Hero\", which gets insanely easy once you even start to hunt some collectibles (or buying items)\nThe games gets a reverse difficulty curve, where it becomes easier the farther you come in the game because the difficulty doesn't scale enough with the upgrades you find.\n\nAnother even worse example is \"Nier Automata\" where the balancing of the game is so fucked up that you can get one shotted in the prolouge if you start the game on hard mode. With its many augmentations you can make the game as easy as possible or every single small enemies to large boring hp sponges. There are articifial power levels for every kind of enemy while it actually adds nothing to the experience. The only reason why it's there  is, because growing numbers stimulate your brain, it feels good to see progression of your character even when it just boils down to some values, the numbers fight more against eachother. like you the enemies, at least that's the impression I got. \n\nEven in turn based tactic games I was always more the fan of \"Advance Wars\", because every time I played one of the newer fire emblem entries, there was at one time the point in the game where I could totally obliberite the enemy forces with my one and most precious unit. That totally eliminates the entire strategy part of the game, because the odds are unfairly on your side. \n\nTo formulate it rather harsh: there are many games where I think that rpg-systems have no right to exist. \n\nWhen I look back to games in the past, many of them were entirely skill based, of course even there, some of them had upgrades, but most of the time they were granted to you statically with the game progression and/or came up with restrictions\n\nA classic example for that is the classic The Legend of Zelda game. You could make the game easier by finding heart containers, but those heart containers were granted to you by finding them in secret locations. So you actually have to earn them which makes it actually (at least not in my definition) not an rpg-mechanic. It's clearly capped how strong you're able to become, there is a certain limit, while in common games with rpg-progression, you can get stronger and stronger by mindless grinding against weaker foes.\nAlso even if you collect many heart containers, you only start with a certain fraction, so to unleash the \"full potential\" of your game avatar, you have to earn yourself the strenght, until then the games stays challenging. \n\nSo yeah I'm pretty annoyed by the trend to give every single kind of game some sort of rpg progression, It's unimaginative it adds nothing to the gameplay perspective and makes the game effortless or ridiciously tedious. It just gives you the illusion of progression while the only thing which happens is that some values increase the more you invest your time in the game.\nI do not have problems with fully fledged RPG's on its own, because, when they are crafted carefully such system can add a great amount customisation to the game, which no other genre can you offer in that scale.\n\nBut lately I get more and more the impression rpg-systems are just there to: \n\n- grant you an easy way out if you can't handle a difficult taks yourself \n- helping you to stay \"addicted\" to a game, nevering-ending increasement of numbers give you always a goal\n- the good feeling of seeing the character get stronger.\n\nIt's seems to be like common practice which is written in a imaginary game bible. No really! I have big problems to find modern games which deny such systems in its entirety, even games which are made in a more arcade retro style like Hard Corps: Uprising do have some sort of rpg-progression.\n\nDoes someone know a game called \"Furi\"? It's a minimalistic boss-rush game and one of the freshest experiences I had in the current gaming generation.\nImagine that game with experience points, which you can use between bosses to higher your stat points and obaining new abilitys like \"auto-block\" or a \"shorter transit cooldown\". Would the game still be appealing? No, not for me,  It would completely lose its own identitiy and all the head-to- head boss fights would be just \"relative\", every player would have its own experience, from \"to easy\" to \"to difficult\", but the feeling of mastering a given situation where the only thing which matters is your own reflexes and mechanical skill would be completely gone.\n\nSo yeah sorry for that long essay.  I can understand the high popularity of rpg-progression-systems and if they are used right in a genre where it really fits, it can enhance the gaming experience. \nSadly most of the modern games I played didn't gave me a reason to appreciate the progression, most of the time it was leading, to frustration because the game wasn't properly balanced to my gameplay style. I know tons of examples and almost every time the rpg-progression was just there because: \"every game does it\".\n",

        "text": "Hello everyone, I haven't posted in a while, so my apologies if this post isn't formatted or tagged correctly.  Also spoilers for Andromeda below:\n\nI've been playing Mass Effect Andromeda for the last few days as part of clearing out my backlog, and to give the game a fair chance separate from all the stories about the game last year.  I'm close to halfway through the main story and am struggling to stay interested in the game, and I felt like talking about it a bit.\n\nI'll start with the most recent world I visited, Elaaden.  I had originally visited the world as part of investigating the Turian Ark, and wound up going to do a different questline due to its proximity to the ship landing site.  That questline revolved around the krogan colony on the planet having a new leader looking for a drive core to, and I state it here because it will come up later, to build a bomb and attack the Nexus.  Thus, the quest revolved around securing the drive core from the wrecked ship, two sites where it had been, and a third location where the core was found.  There the plot took a twist as the core had been taken by the questgiver as part of a plan to take control of the colony, leading to a fight between the two krogan.  \n\nSaid fight was closer in appearance to the climatic fight from The Room, and I broke out laughing in response to the few seconds before it ended.  Nothing in the questline pulled me in or took an interesting twist, and the leader suddenly wanting to use the core for powering the colony rather than building a bomb was strange since she had been very clear on that point before.  \n\nAfter that I went back to the mission I intended to do, locating the Turian Ark.  From a location site, a trail led back to the Ark which was empty and nearly without power, and revolved around the turian who started that ark's questline finding out his friend was dead and that he was the new Pathfinder.  The mission ended after he took on the role, without mentioning whether the Ark was going back to the Nexus or if anyone onboard was still alive.  In these two missions, and one a previous night I realized that the game had lost what had initially pulled me in.\n\nInvestigating planets had led to a splattering of quests which went nowhere but increasing vitality points, and hazards acted as limits on exploring until the vault quests went done.\n\nFaces struggle to express convincingly, especially on my male Ryder who speaks in a nearly-constant monotone (even during passionate replies and speeches) and looks bored, or on the verge of a nap.\n\nAfter the squadmembers (with the exception of Jaal) took me their backstories in the first conversation, there's little left to explore with them.\n\nA new alien race was found and immediately sent me on a dozen fetch quests after their critical missions, with not even a set of laws from their world available to read.\n\nMost of the time, none of the dialogue options sound like something I would want to pick, and read like the \"safe\" options rather than committing to a specific tone.\n\nDriving around feels like the Mass Effect One worlds stretched out to a massive extent, proceeding across miles of empty land to another marker.\n\nThe Archon is supposed to be the bad guy but never shows up and there's been no motive to his actions, and the big twist (the new race being turned into Kett) is highly similar to the one from Mass Effect Two (Protheans turned into Collectors), with a few minor details moved around.

However, with local multiplayer being all but dead there really isn't any reason to own a second controller anymore. The only game on PS4 I own with local multiplayer (that I would actually want to play) is Borderlands. I can't think of single other title that has relevant local multiplayer.\n\nHas there ever been a third-party controller that equals or exceeds first-party offerings? In my experience all third-party controllers have been inferior. Although, I believe there is a manufacturer that makes new N64 controllers and those are pretty much identical to the Nintendo originals. It's not like there isn't some room for improvement on older systems. I've always found official PS2 controllers to be a little flimsy. In my limited experience they are the only controllers I have managed to \"wear out\", although I did have a PS3 controller die on me (but it was used when I got it). \n\nIs it just due to the fact that modern controllers are too complicated to reproduce without serious manufacturing clout? The PS4 controller is remarkably complicated (though most of its features are pretty useless: the touchpad in my experience has never been anything more than an oversized button, and I hate it when games even acknowledge the fact that the controller does motion-sensing).

Maybe Kojima had 100&amp;#37; freedom to do whatever he wanted, but maybe Konami's restrictions are what stopped Kojima from making something too crazy and, consequentially, bad. Remember Inafune with Mighty n. 9?\n\nWe don't even know exactly what kind of game it will be. Will it be a shooter? Maybe an adventure game? Maybe a Quantic Dream\\-style game? We don't know.\n\nAll this hype is just setting people up for disappointment. Yes, it could come out to be the best game of this generation, but I'd rather wait and see than set my expectations sky\\-high and get disappointed if it's just a great game.\n\nDeath Stranding is just the most absurd example of this disproportionate hype, but browse a gaming forum for 5 minutes and you'll find a lot of similar cases.\n\nPs.: Can you believe it has already been 2 years since Death Stranding's announcement and we still have virtually no information about it?",

        "text": "My friends have a bit of an odd quirk.\n\nThey're terrified of playing ranked modes in multiplayer games, even though they always play to win.\n\nWhat I find odd about this scenario is that there's no reason to play aside from fun- it isn't as if they're pro players, there's no real-world stakes, and yet they're terrified of their gameplay being tracked.\n\nThey play League of Legends religiously.  I actually tried it for a while with them, they helped me learn the ropes, taught me how to play semi-decently, and always played to win.  They actually played as a team.  Despite already playing competitively by definition, they loathed the idea of playing ranked, seeming to feel that it would be a worse experience overall despite probably playing other teams that are, well, playing to win.  (I didn't find it particularly fun, but I enjoyed messing around with them.)\n\nSame thing happens in Overwatch.  I know, OW competitive has had it's issues, but that isn't what turns them off, it's literally the word competitive.  Their reaction tends to be \"I don't want to play against god-tier players\", or simply that they want to play more \"casually\", even though, again, every match they play to win.  We focus on team composition, we work together, we all try our best... but play the mode that rewards that exact thing, along with matching you against players based on your performance?  Nope. Hell no.\n\nHilariously, the un-seriousness of Overwatch quick-play annoys them so much (teammates that *don't* play to win, which is what comp matches would in theory give them, especially since we can often almost have a full team) has led us to mostly play free-for-all deathmatch in custom lobbies.  We're all still competitive, we play to win, but for whatever reason playing a free-for-all mode in a game that doesn't really work as a free-for-all deathmatch is more appealing to them.\n\nRealizing that the main draw seems to be not dealing with a team, I've been suggesting they play Quake Champions with me once it goes free-to-play.  The response?  \"Fuck no, Quake is, like, hardcore or something.\"  Their extent of their exposure to it has been seeing some insane clip from a duel tournament or something.  I try to explain to them that it's *built* for FFA nonsense, that Quake is basically the Smash Bros. of shooters, that it would be *perfect* for what we've been doing lately and we could play it in custom lobbies with no one else, but no, despite being free (in the future), **the thought of some incredibly skilled players existing and the general myth of Quake being hard to play at a basic level scares them away.**\n\nI guess what I'm asking is this: Why do people shy away from gamemodes that focus on playing to win and improving when that's already what they do on a near-daily basis?\n\n\n\n**Edit:**  I'd like to reiterate that what's especially odd is that we have a full team of friends.  There's usually no possibility of being \"flamed\" because we fill whole teams.  I totally understand avoiding it to avoid toxic people.",

        "text": "So apparently no one hates games quite as much as gamers.\n\nI've just watched the announcement trailer for Battlefield V and I've gotta say, I'm real disappointed. Not in Dice or even in EA for once, but in the gaming community's now almost default reaction towards outrage on such a bafflingly disproportionate and depressingly cynical level.\n\n*Every single* post on the front page of /[r/Battlefield\\_one](https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield_one) is bashing just one, ultimately irrelevant, aspect of the game, with absolutely zero discussion regarding actual gameplay \\(of which there's plenty to talk about\\), the fresh setting, or what I cautiously must say look like some actually decent business practices by EA. Instead though, the internet again proves it's yet to mature beyond the level of a middle school locker room.\n\n&gt;'CoD players got what they wanted. We got...a woman who looks like a Twitch streamer.'  \n&gt;  \n&gt;' This is WW2. The war known for its equal rights among its troops and presence of disabled female frontline combatants. '  \n&gt;  \n&gt;' I was just wondering the other day why no one made a game about WW2 with female front line soldiers who have one hand and a claw. '  \n&gt;  \n&gt;' if we want this trash SJW content to stop infiltrating our games, we have not buy THIS SJW WET DREAM, dislike the trailer, and we should get big youtubers to lash out. But that won't happen because they all sold out.'\n\nI could go on with the examples, but there's an illuminating cross section of some top rated comments from r/games and r/battlefield_one.  I for one am sick beyond measure of attitudes like these permeating every corner of the internet, especially when it comes to the so\\-called 'fans' of a franchise, whether it's films, games, or TV. Are the 'anti\\-pc' crowd so blinded by the red mists of misogyny that they can't see the irony in their crying?  That even a whiff of what they refer to as 'SJW propaganda' \\(or as one commentator dubbed it 'the vagina\\-washing of history'\\), has derailed the entire discussion of one of gaming's biggest franchises because they're 'triggered' over the mere sight of women in a trailer. Pathetic doesn't even begin to scratch the surface.\n\nThis petty whinging is then followed by a slew of armchair historians banging on about so\\-called 'historical accuracy' and the game doing a disservice to the memory of World War 2. At this point I begin to wonder whether I saw a different trailer to everyone else... Where the assumption that this is, or every was a historically accurate WWII game, has come from is beyond me. Clearly, *clearly*, it's set in an alternative universe where, judging by the tech and aesthetic, the war did not end in 1945 but has continued indefinitely. Funnily enough, huge swathes of the able, male population were depleted by the initial conflict, so there's no prizes for guessing who would have logically been conscripted next, should the war have continued on.\n\nAnd if this isn't the case and the game *is* set in the typical '39 \\- '45 era, then good on you Dice for attempting something new and turning the formula, visually at least, on it's head. WWII is a tired and worn out playground for gaming, with according to this [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_World_War_II_video_games), some 300 plus entries, the vast majority of which \\(AAA titles especially\\) being creatively bankrupt beige and khaki experiences, where we play as the same old cliched and grizzled heroes time and time again. There's no room in today's gaming market for another bog\\-standard WWII fps and frankly I'm thankful. I've lost track of the number of generic WWII action games I've played; the setting is long beyond exhausted. Do you remember when games \\(yes even those aimed at adults\\) were fun and vibrant instead of moody and gritty, and when developers were aware of colours other than beige and grey? I do.\n\nHonestly I feel terrible for Dice, there's no winning with their 'fans' and the incessantly entitled bitching of the gaming community; I can imagine the comments now if they had stuck to a traditional formula. Bad Company is everyone's favourite Battlefield title and for good reason, it didn't take itself too seriously, hell, there's a  yellow smiley face on the front cover for God's sake. Yet as soon as Dice try and recapture this spirit, something which has been sorely absent from the games industry in recent years, everyone shits on them for some imagined connection to the 'SJW\\-washing of history.'\n\nThis whole outcry is a complete non\\-issue at best, and at worst  an excuse for insecure basement dwellers and red pillers everywhere to champion their misogyny in the mainstream, as if somehow the mere reminder that women exist is an affront to their masculinity, which apparently can no longer be vicariously channeled through the lens of yet another gritty, harcore, historically accurate, and done to death fps setting.\n\nEdit: wow, downvoted within 5 seconds of posting.

As in, it coincided with the events of your life, or helped you through a hard time.\n\nI recently\\(ish\\) finished Uncharted 4. I've been married for about four years, and hadn't been realizing that within my relationship with my wife I'd been dealing with a lot of the same issues that Elena and Nathan were dealing with. The desire for freedom and validation outside of marriage was really strong. This is in no way to suggest that I had cheated. I was just missing the ability to do things when I wanted to, and try feel some of the 'glory days' again. As I played through Uncharted 4, I realized that was exactly what Nathan had been doing, and my attitude towards my wife had been almost the exact same. There was a moment right after Nate and Elena use one of \\(everybody's favorite\\) crank to bring up their jeep. They start talking about their issue, but Elena cuts it off and says, \"We should stay focused\". There's then a really quite jeep ride. I was like, \"HOLY CRAP, THIS JUST HAPPENED TO ME.\" I started to see the impact of my attitude on my wife. Using that example, I was able to stop sub\\-consciously giving my wife the cold shoulder, and it really helped our relationship. It didn't single handedly save our marriage, but it did certainly help me understand my issues a little better.\n\nYou guys?",

        "text": "**TL;DR: I play a lot of video games from many different genres and eras at the same time. Is that weird?**\n\nLast night, I had a somewhat uncomfortable discussion with my younger brother (we're both adults, for the record). He's been pressing me for a long time to devote myself to GTA Online, the online multiplayer mode for GTAV. He is pretty much a master at it and knows it like the back of his hand, and it's all legit with him, no cheats or mods at all; clearly he loves it, and wants me to squad up with him and enjoy it like he does. \n\nThe problem is, I find GTA Online to be profoundly boring. I have no desire to make GTA Online my everyday pastime like he has. I only really enjoy playing it from time to time in short bursts alongside him or other friends, if ever. So last night I had to confront him with the reality of my gaming habits: I play lots of video games. He's played video games his whole life too, but apparently we have different priorities. I had to tell him, to paraphrase our discussion, that if he wants me to play with him, he should level up an alternate character because I have even less fun playing alongside a character who is way overleveled. When we do play together I'd like us to be at least on par, so we have some progression to make. We had the same problem with the Borderlands games, actually. I have a full-time job and responsibilities and other habits besides video games, obviously, so my time is already limited. But because he plays exactly one game at any given time, in each game we played I didn't even have a chance to play with him compatibly for long because it was only a short amount of time before his character was incredibly overleveled, overpowered, and no longer on the same tier as mine.  \n\nOn my PC alone I have about a dozen games installed and I am currently in-progress with all of them. That's not counting Overwatch which is ongoing for me, the hundreds of Steam games I own, the games I own on Origin and other online services, as well as the other dozen games I have installed on the PS4 and Xbox One that I am also in-progress with. If I didn't have a job, I could sit in front of my monitor and TV for eight hours a day and it would probably take me a year if not longer to finish all my games. For him though, GTA is his *one* game. He's completed the rest of his games, and now GTA Online is his one thing. Not only that, he gains, what to me is, an insane amount of gratification from exploiting and basically manhandling a game's content for so long that his character has maximum money and he can melt all enemies in the game with the flick of his wrist. That doesn't work for me. If the goal or challenge in any form in the game is removed, my interest drops pretty steeply, I'm afraid. And from day to day, my interests change as well. Some weeks I get a hankering for a good RPG and I'll make that what I'm playing for a time, and it doesn't need to be a new game either. Then that will change, and I'll be on an FPS kick for a while. Why, just last weekend I picked back up on Prey (2017) after taking a break for a few months and am close to finishing, then installed Amnesia which I've meant to play for a long time (and am out of the loop apparently), and that's only two selections out of the other games from different genres I'm playing. I have at least three hardcore RPGs I'm also in the middle of, which I will go back to at any given time. If a game keeps me hooked from start to finish as soon as I buy it, that means it's a dang good game.\n\nIs anybody else like this or am I just a jack of all trades, master of none?\n",

Over the past year we have seen the mantra of live services, and it has become very obvious that the mantra has been with us for quite some time (at least since the farmville era of game development).\n\nI was reminded of a lot of this due to my general disdain of gaming recently, and the associated \"corporate greed\" that gaming seems to be generating like customers to a hotcake stand. A common argument for games being services, and game companies wanting to turn a profit has recently been \"well they're companies they're making games to make money\". This can be of course seen very commonly on Reddit.\n\nNo, I personally play games that I feel have that level of detail, that tickle my gaming itch. This means that I regularly avoid games from large developers (See: Ubisoft / EA / Activision / Anything owned by Tencent (See: Their acquisition of shares in Fortnite / PUBG)) because I don't think they are bringing anything new to the table, but rehashing old, well established ideas to bring in that delicious \"Mommy's credit card\" money to their portfolios.\n\nAnd finally, what games are out there do you think are well worth buying, while coming from developers (big or small) which feel like they are putting their best foot forward, trying to create the best gaming experience possible?",

When it finally arrived in the mail, I put it in my gamecube to try it out.\nThe game was so bizarre, but in a good way. It was simple yet unique in its own way.\nBring the wilderness back to the land, kill the killer cubivore and become king of the cubivores. You did this by killing and devouring other cubivores to mutate into different forms. There was over 150 different mutations. Unlocking them all meant you could challenge the final boss for the title of king of the cubivores.\n\nYou had names like AC, Bulldozer, Portfolio, and Buzzcut. There were different colored cubivores that each had strengths and weaknesses. Yellowbrates are strong and have good defense, but are slow, purpials are agile and can run backwards and dash very quickly, redapeds have high jumping and quick speed, but lowest attack, bluocytes could pounce from the farthest away, and greyodons are the most well rounded and have high attack damage and very fast dash speed.\n\nYou could mate and have offspring. This was another way to unlock other mutations. After selecting your offspring to continue as, you spawn outside the love tunnel next to a head that indicates was you before you were devoured. You continue as your offspring. The more mutations you unlocked, the more females that wanted to mate with you. \n\nThere were mini bosses that had special powers you could acquire after devouring them. Powers that could enable you to tear off meat and continue running, camouflage, and the ability to dash.\n\nI personally liked the game so much I even bought a copy that I have to this day. \n\nHas anyone else played this game?\n",

        "text": "Some modern games have a fairly insignificant HUD \\(heads\\-up display\\) in order to communicate information to the player. As an example, many FPS games have red streaks on the screen, or the colour of the screen gradually turning more black\\-and\\-white, to indicate that the player has been shot. This feature is quite common in multiplayer games with fast TTK or regenerating health, since working out how much health you have left is less necessary in a setting where one encounter is likely to either kill or not kill you, and where your health will regenerate to full in a short time.\n\nAnother example is Stranded Deep \\(Steam survival game\\). *This has been changed now*, but in the early stages of the game, there was no easily\\-visible oxygen indicator, so the player could go underwater for a while and not notice the edges of the screen getting a little darker, then resurface to find that half their health has depleted due to being underwater for so long. \\(The actual health bar was and is still only visible by pressing a key to view the user's statistics, as far as I know\\).\n\nCertain games may go for the absolute minimum HUD in order to increase the player's immersion in the game, by delivering information through the environment rather than by several bars and numbers on the screen. However, some players can find that this often doesn't communicate the vital information well enough.\n\nWhat's the best way to balance immersion with displaying all the required information to the player?",

        "text": "I've been posting for a while on another site, [retrojunk.com](https://retrojunk.com), and written several articles about all kinds of things from when I was growing up in the 80s and 90s.  I thought it could be interesting to open up a conversation and examination into video games then and now! Ooooooooooo...\n\nI've been getting pretty much every console since N64... up until the past few generations. I haven't bought a Wii U, PS4, or Switch.  I've thought about it! But ultimately skipped it.  I think it's a combination of how expensive they were, a declining interest in games, and... the wife \\(and life\\) lol. I picked up an XBOX One thinking it'd lead this generation after how well 360 did, but it seems that it's been PS4's generation. Anyway \\- I remember back with Nintendo \\- PS2, there were tons of games I wanted and bought, but after PS2, my interest started to wane a bit. With my X1, I've only bought maybe 10 games, and REALLY only gotten into 3 \\- Diablo 3 and Borderlands 2/TPS \\(which are all holdovers from the previous generation...\\).  The loot, character leveling, and interesting world and characters kept me playing.  Most of the biggest titles out there don't interest me AT ALL. On top of only playing very few games recently, I've gone back to playing my old SNES/PS1/2 games!  \n\nSo my question is, for other gamers around my age \\(34\\), what are YOUR thoughts on what video games were and have become? For me, I think it's a combination of a lack of simple fun and an increasing focus on multiplayer instead of single player.  Is it that, or could it just be nostalgia and the biggest pair of rose\\-tinted glasses ever?",

        "text": "I've written an article on the topic [here](https://seanedgarcritic.wordpress.com/2018/05/20/nier-automata-side-quests-vs-plot/). The slightly shorter version is this:\n\nThrough my first playthrough of Nier Automata, through ending A, I felt that the plot and character development were messy. Development was made in one scene, then undone in the next. Characters would learn something and then an hour later react in disbelief to the same thing.\n\nMy second playthrough, I skipped most of the side quests and found the development much more consistent and clear. I realized in retrospect that, although many of the side quests are quite well written, they cause a problem with the overall progression of the story: because they focus on the same single theme as the main story and add little else outside that, and because they can be completed in different orders and at different times, they disrupt the flow of the story.\n\nI feel the game would have been much better if the most thematically significant side quests were either 1: only accessible for a short time, perhaps as a separated category of quest called something like \"limited time event\", or 2: rewritten to focus on smaller, more tangential aspects of the characters and world, so that the primary theme and development of the characters along their primary arc would be allowed to progress smoothly, with the added benefit of fleshing out the protagonists better.\n\nHave you played any other games that had similar problems, or that did some of these things particularly well? Or do you feel there's something I've missed?",

I also develop a mini obsession with it where I spend my free time googling questions, going on the game’s sub, and reading about strats. I feel good when I win and feel neutral when I lose. \n\nStage 3: I’ve now dumped a lot of time into the game. It’s no longer a novelty, but a full-fledged activity. I start getting super salty and lashing out hard on teammates without empathy. At this point I consider lost games a waste of time and really play for the small emotional high of winning. Feels like some kind of drug addiction, I’ve never again felt as happy as I did after winning long games of league. Nothing could break my great mood. This part’s going to sound really fucked up: When I used to win on league I would be so elated and full of joy that I would run downstairs, hug my mom, and tell her I love her. The same wouldn’t happen if I lost at league, I would just cry in my room instead, sometimes for over an hour. At this stage, I only play for the high feeling, hardly for the actual gameplay anymore. For most other games, I just feel neutral when I win, and really angry/sad when I lost. \n\nThis has happened to me for about 4 years now with a ton of games.

Very seldomly can you actually do whatever you like and still become very powerful.\n\nI don't understand this, as being mean/evil should come at the price of feeling bad for doing it and not have some arbitrary punishment attached.\n\nI also just played Divinity:OS2 with some friends who wouldnt let me [spoiler subject](#s \"gas the population of a capital city to death\") , even though it gives nice XP.

Scenes with heavy emotional weight would still require a professional actor putting their acting lessons to good use. But I am imagining the smaller often overlooked roles, the store clerks in an RPG, the random bits of dialogue from NPCs, the narration.\n\nFor a more concrete example, here is [the Codex from Mass Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKZBqdADz1k), it was a little unconventional as the text actually got read out loud, which doesn’t happen often.  The reason for this is because to do that you need to pay a voice actor, so most developers would rather save the money and just let the player read. But if these trivial bits of dialogue could be automatized we may see a lot more like this, especially from developers who previously couldn’t afford voice acting at all.\n\nSo, how viable do y’all think this would be?",
