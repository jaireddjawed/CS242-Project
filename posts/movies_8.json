Same with actors... or any category.\n\nI always wish there was a little more daylight or time and space between the art and the resonance in society or culture. So many movies were Oscar bait that were pretty hollow, while so many other movies just couldn't be comprehended or understood at the time of release.\n\nSo has anyone ever contemplated an awards show that is 10 or 25 years later?\n\nArt isn't always reviewed critically or by audiences correctly immediately after release. I know AFI has their list, but a live show of sorts? Who is on board lol! :)",

I like the lighting and stuff that's common in movies from the 1980s. And my fav types of movies are fighting movies. Idk if Mandy (starring nicholas cage) is a serious movie or if it has as much fighting as hobo with a shotgun. Also, I generally don't like the fighting in older movies, the oldest movies with fights that I like are: They live (by John Carpenter) &amp; Game of death (by Bruce Lee). I liked some of the combat in the swordplay of each of the movies in the original star wars trilogy, but the only one where I'd say I liked the majority of the lightsaber battle would have to be the last one",

Have you ever seen a dramatic movie that was a completely original story, but filmed as if it was a documentary? To be clear, I'm talking actual documentary style with re-enactments, interviews, etc., not \"found footage\" kind of stuff. I would love to hear of examples anyone can bring to my attention.",

For me, the combination of Sophie’s coming of age and child-like innocence while enjoying a vacation with her dad unbeknownst to her that he’s planning to, or wants to, end his life, plus the idea of not knowing or understanding your parent’s struggles as a child and then, as an adult, wishing you were older and could have understood it to help them. The rave scene where adult Sophie is holding her dad and he hasn’t aged. And then they separate and she kind of falls away, but as a child. It just fucked me up. I feel like this needed a trigger warning or something, because I don’t have anyone close to me that does by suicide and I am still really struggling to overcome my emotions.",

For the first 1/3 of the movie, Calum is wearing a cast. They even make a few references to it during the movie. However, there's a part at the beginning that shows Calum and Sophie jumping into the Mediterranean Sea and Calum is NOT wearing his cast. There's a scene much later where he cuts himself whilst attempting to cut it off his wrist. \n\nIs this a continuity error or is it intentional, because the movie forces you to see the movie through Sophie's vague memories of her trip with her dad? I'd like to believe it was the later, because of how obvious it was that the director put a TON of thought into almost every shot in the movie. Nothing seems to be accidental. \n\nI cannot tell you how much this movie means to me.",

I just wish they would play it for the types that want to go watch it and one for people that want to go have fun there.",

        "text": "For me, the best has to be DREAM WARRIORS. Wes Craven wrote the script. It sucks that Craven shaded the sequels in SCREAM, saying they all sucked, but in my opinion, DREAM WARRIORS and NEW NIGHTMARE were almost as good as the original but DREAM WARRIORS wins just for sheer creativity and a great cast. Patricia Arquette was solid as Kristen and I dare say Kristen might have taken over if Arquette had stayed on. Who knows? \n\nI love the concept, I know people hated Nancy in here but I feel there was no other way for the character to continue and I felt they gave her a proper conclusion. Great direction by Chuck Russell as well. \n\nWorst, for me, has to be THE DREAM CHILD. Too boring and I hated Alice. It felt it was trying to do something out there but it just didn't feel engaging and Alice might have worked when she was Nancy 2.0, but not as Rosemany's Baby. I know people hate FINAL NIGHTMARE but at least that movie was campy fun. This wasn't even that.",
