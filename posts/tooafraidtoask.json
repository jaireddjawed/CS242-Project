You can check it out [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TooAfraidToAsk\/wiki\/faq) .\n\nThis is something we've been working on for awhile. Special shoutout to \/u\/stillcouldbeworse for actually finally getting it up and running! This initial version is pretty short to keep it simple and avoid breaking anything, but we expect to be adding to it regularly now that it's up and running. We'll of course be mentioning it in the sidebar or the full wiki as well.  \n\nSince this is the first public iteration, you can expect some tweaking as we figure out how to best utilize it. Features\/questions\/formats might change. And now is probably a good time to ask a few questions for the community-  \n&nbsp;  \n\nWhat are some things you want to see in the FAQ wiki?  \n\nHow do you want to see the FAQ wiki utilized? (ie, should automod sticky a comment linking to the FAQ wiki? filter out FAQs?)  \n\nHow should it be sourced? Should it link to existing posts (either in this sub or another), external sources?  \n\nWhat threshold do you consider acceptable to be a FAQ?  \n\nAny other requests\/ideas\/questions?  \n&nbsp;  \nAnd last- while one of the goals here is to help promote a bit more variety in OPs, it is still **NOT OK** to question-shame FAQs. You can direct them to the FAQ wiki, but do so politely and kindly. You *will* get a ban, per Rule 1, for rude replies to questions. We get that FAQ posts can be a bit annoying for longtime users, but we still expect you to be polite about it.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1655788407.0},{"title":"Why are there more sexual orientations than 3?

Never had any major issues, however I did have two unpleasant experiences where I had just smoked too much and felt sick. A couple months ago, I tried edibles for the first time. I definitely got super high off of those, but I had a good time nonetheless.\n\nNow, the last time I had an edible (the same dosage as I had been taking), it gave me the actual most horrifying experience I\u2019ve ever had in my life. I was with a group of friends, and it all started out fine. Was feeling high, got myself some snacks to munch on, the usual. As time passed though, I got increasingly paranoid that I didn\u2019t belong within my group of friends, that I was an outcast in some way and that they were only friends with me because they pitied me. These negative thoughts were really starting to bug me, so I excused myself and went to my bedroom (the friend function was at my apartment). \n\nIt\u2019s important to mention that I also have a pet cat, I absolutely adore her. She followed me to my room when I excused myself and laid on my bed with me for a bit. At one point, we were staring at each other, and I felt like I had this psychic connection to her and that I could communicate with her through this connection. So I was \u201ctelepathically\u201d telling her how good of a cat she is, etc, etc, and then suddenly I got this feeling of dread. My cat was telling me that she knows she\u2019s a good cat, and that I exist to serve her, and all this narcissistic shit. I genuinely saw evil in her eyes, and in that moment I swear I felt the presence of a demon in her. Now, because we were telepathically connected and she could read my thoughts, the demon that had possessed her knew that I had spotted it. And because I had found it, it was now going to kill me. \n\nThis sounds absolutely ridiculous, but in short, I truly believed that my cat was possessed by a demon that was going to kill me. The demon was still telepathically connected to me too, so it was sending all of these horrifying images and thoughts into my mind, and I had zero control over it. I felt like I was actually losing my mind, and that I was going to die that night. The demon told me that it was going to drag me down to hell with it, and I\u2019d burn for eternity. \n\nI laid in the fetal position for like 2 hours, unable to force myself to sleep it off due to the intense thoughts. Thankfully, my roommate came to check on me and comforted me for the rest of the trip. She also removed the cat from my room and kept the door closed to prevent her from coming back in and sending me into another spiral.\n\nI look back at this and laugh now because of its absurdity, but in the moment, it was absolutely traumatizing. When I was in this state of delusion, I was aware that the thoughts I was having were ridiculous- but I BELIEVED them. They were reality to me. But because I was aware of how dumb they were (my cat plotting to kill me), it freaked me out even more because I knew that I was going insane and I was scared I\u2019ve never return back to normal.\n\nI\u2019ve quit all cannabis products since then, and I\u2019m wondering if anyone else has had crazy shit like this happen to them due to weed products??","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1678504091.0},{"title":"Can you help me?","author":"YardAmazing5693","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TooAfraidToAsk\/comments\/11psevq\/can_you_help_me\/","text":"So, prom is in 4 months (UK).

I've lost *so much* to unemployment, I can't stay this way. \n\nI don't judge others who work these kind of jobs, working is better than not, but I still can't help but feel like shit at the thought of how I'd look to others.","upvote_ratio":0.56,"created_utc":1678623296.0},{"title":"Can someone help me figure out if my boss (38F) is hitting on me (36M)?","author":"mtlreddit14","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TooAfraidToAsk\/comments\/11p09h5\/can_someone_help_me_figure_out_if_my_boss_38f_is\/","text":"So my boss and I have a very good working relationship.

My friend and I are from the same club. He's also trying to run for an executive position.\n\nSome girls I'm referring to from the title are from the club as well. He recently started hanging out with his male friend in a club meeting room (a place for either studying in silence or chilling because a club study room is usually crowded) and the same girls are there too. Both my friend and the girls have neither talked much nor interacted. They are also close with his friend.\n\nThe issue is that the girls feel so uncomfortable whenever my friend enters the room. One time when my friend peeked around the room just to see them sitting, they felt uncomfortable immediately and it was like the final straw. So they hesitate to come in the room anymore because they feel uncomfortable when my friend is in the room. They came to my friend's friend about this and my friend's friend warned him to not enter without waiting at the door and calling for him. Now my friend feels horrible and guilty about it.\n\nThe truth is that I know him very well. He's religious and smart. He's a genuinely good person. He wouldn't even dare to cross the boundaries as he has a good relationship with most of the community. He had zero intentions whenever he entered the room. The reason why he simply peeked around the room is that he wanted to see if there were some dudes he know. He heard the female voices so he had to turn around & left.\n\nI don't understand this kind of thinking process. How do some girls even come to this conclusion? I have seen a lot of cases where guys get falsely judged as creeps. This is similar to the common occurrence in the gym. I have seen it a lot, especially on Joey Swoll's TikTok.  Some guys get falsely accused of sexual harassment because of a similar occurrence.  I'm just trying to help him know he's not in the wrong. He's now questioning if running for exec is even worth it. He knows it's not his fault but the reason why he regrets this situation is that it was he who made the girls feel uncomfortable regardless of his involvement. I didn't want to ask this somewhere because some people might get too sensitive in the comments so I hope this is the right place to post. t's just hurting to see good people being falsely judged.","upvote_ratio":0.44,"created_utc":1678570319.0},{"title":"Should I be worried about how this child will interact with the world around her?","author":"PianoShy","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TooAfraidToAsk\/comments\/11oq6p8\/should_i_be_worried_about_how_this_child_will\/","text":"I (25 F) am Christian, and my friend (29 F) is an Atheist and mother to an 11-year-old girl, but she is not the easiest to get along with. She has no mental disorders and comes from a loving family (she has admitted this) who would love to have a relationship with her daughter, but she won\u2019t let them.\n\nI know she has issues with Christianity (specifically). Still, I t get involved with religious conversations because she would insult my intelligence by saying there was no way I could be Christian and earn a Master\u2019s in a rigorous physical science. I have nothing to say to her about this because, to me, science is how God show their face.\n\nWe hadn\u2019t seen each other in a long time and wanted to catch up. I was busy all last week but was free after church on Sunday. I could tell she was annoyed that i couldn\u2019t hang out earlier, so I told her that we could hang out after church, get brunch, and go to the movies, OR (if she was that impatient) she could join me at service and then we could do all those things. It was an invitation.\n\nShe didn\u2019t like that because she started talking about how I should know she would never step into a church again (valid, and I apologized.) She started talking about how she had religious trauma (She has never told me this.) There was a lot of other stuff in between, but what got my goat was when she said, essentially, that if she found anything in her house that was about Christianity, she would rip it up or donate it. She would not have anything associated with religion in her home. Even though her daughter attends a religious school (the best private school in our area), she and her husband start the day by telling their daughter, \u201cRemember, Jesus, isn\u2019t real.\u201d I\u2019m unsure how true this statement is because she says many wild things, but she said it.\n\nI was shaken because it explained why her daughter had difficulties interacting with kids in her school. One day, my friend vented to me that her daughter came back asking questions about different faiths. I don\u2019t know what these questions consisted of. Still, my friend was upset that the kids did not want to be friends with her daughter but could not see that it was because her kid was freaking the other kids out by telling them that God was not real. Her kid has no friends now, and it makes me sad.\n\nI don\u2019t care how you raise your children as long as they can coexist in a world not curated for them. As someone autistic who didn\u2019t have many friends growing up, I understand what it is like to be lonely like her daughter. This set her off because my friend seemed to think I was calling her a bad mother. I told her that she doesn\u2019t even let her daughter have a relationship with her grandparents because they are still active in their church. I said she created a very socially inept and angry child that will turn into a very socially inept and angry adult.\nWe haven\u2019t spoken in a month, and I could have handled that better.  \n\nPlease not that I\u2019m not saying her raising a child Atheist is bad. I\u2019m also in a loving relationship with an almost Atheist man who was raised Jewish. I am just concerned about how this child will interact with her world around her.","upvote_ratio":0.47,"created_utc":1678556757.0},{"title":"what jobs can I do in music?","author":"i_wantapizza_","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TooAfraidToAsk\/comments\/11oq52c\/what_jobs_can_i_do_in_music\/","text":"I wanna get a degree in music but I'm not sure what jobs I can do that will pay high with a music degree there's just so many but idk which one to choose any suggestions?

When I was really little I loved it. Come to find out, apparently King Louie is frowned upon in that movie due to being a black stereotype? So I went on Youtube to watch clips and refresh my memory. And honestly? What the fuck is the big deal? He sounds African American. But where the fuck is the indication of stereotype? I can't see it at all.

Excuse my lack of knowledge there) \n\nI'm just so sick of this. There's always fucking something. What happened to South Park being the worst fucking contender to offend people and spread outrage? Why do so many pieces of entertainment have to have some stupid ass backlash against them? Why are people wasting their fucking time getting offended over 60 year old movies?

I'm genuinely fucking confused as to what has happened over the last 10 years that has caused outrage over the smallest shit that goes on.

A bit frustrated that people will seemingly get pissed off over the dumbest shit. And I know what sexism and racism is. If movies had black face I'd be pissed. And the Cuties outrage was warranted. Don't tell me I don't know what it is. I'm just simply saying a lot of people nowadays seem to get so angry over dumb shit. And I'm not the only one with this mindset. Chris fucking Rock talked about this on his recent stand-up who Reddit seems to like.\n\nEdit 2: Did some research on the connection between monkey's and black people and I see now why people are offended by it.

It\u2019s easier to hide and less obvious. Therefore, to the image-oriented, if you look normal, you *are* normal.

People want to believe that if something is \u201cin your head\u201d, then it\u2019s entirely your choice and your responsibility. (To argue the same for most physical health problems would be absurd and cruel.)\n* Mental illnesses which rise to the level of clinical problems make patients unpleasant to interact with, in a way that most mentally healthy people can\u2019t get past, and hinders empathy for them. There\u2019s no equivalent of, \u201cShe\u2019s doing all she can to live with her [physical] issues and she\u2019s *really* nice!\u201d for clinical-level mental health patients.\n* Economically, the mentally ill are a net drain on society and public resources, because their problems take a greater toll on their ability to get along with and be related to and trusted by people, and are more indefinite in their durations and viable solutions. They \u201cdon\u2019t pay their way\u201d.\n* The minority of people who are builders, upholders, or beneficiaries of society the way it is, work against their own interests by doing and saying things that show that their system literally drives many people crazy, with its double messages, double binds, and unrealistic expectations.\n\nThese theories are hardly mutually exclusive.

I also have to be super mindful of what I wear and making sure I don't come off the wrong way to other male colleagues. When I'm out, greeting to either a male neighbor or male period is met with being ignored. But if your a male, doesn't matter if they know you a lot of times they will speak or nod their head.

I know it's a medical diagnosis and I don't want to dabble in self-diagnosis, but I do think it's important to question this in order to understand how to move forward.\n\nIt took a long time for me to be able to admit to myself that I'm traumatized. On paper, the incident would sound laughable if labeled as a traumatic event, but the effect it had on me was just too severe to write off as anything but trauma. The negative emotions that sometimes resurface are still so strong\u2013for a while I would attribute it to my subconscious refusal to move on from a situation where I was at fault, out of guilt. I have diagnosed ADHD and anxiety, so I always understood the severity of my reaction to be because of my inability to regulate emotions. Rejection sensitive dysphoria is a real bastard.\n\nIt happened mid-November of last year. I was not the instigator, but I was essentially the direct cause of the instigation. I can't provide substantial context in fear of being recognized, but I'm open to answering questions if context is needed. For now, what's important to note is that I hold myself responsible for the incident.\n\nHere are the major affects it had on me:\n\n* This took a while for me to admit to myself, but I did have a trigger of sorts (I use the word 'trigger' tentatively, as I'm not familiar with the medical definition). It was anything to do with this particular media platform, whether by name or logo symbol. Someone would simply send a link in a group chat sharing something silly, and I'd go silent and have to remove myself from the conversation, and essentially shut down. If I recognized a screenshot of said platform while on a different platform, it'd invoke a similar reaction. It doesn't quite happen anymore, but there's definitely a quiet and bitter feeling.\n* I feel...haunted by the memory of that day, like I can feel it and see it. I remember the dark dorm room lit only by my bedside lamp and my roommate sleeping soundly as I stifled through my 12-hour sobbing session. I remember the sun rising through my haze, and me growing nauseous with exhaustion as the blue turned lighter. I remember the terror and devastation so clearly and I wish I didn't. It's very slowly been fading as I grow jaded, but it's there, and for a long time it was horribly vivid.\n* Some rants typed a month ago, from my private story when I was spiraling again (majority of which don't actually know any of the context): \"i think i'm doing a pretty alright job of moving on but i don't think i'll ever be able to forget the sheer amount of emotion i'd felt that night\" \"i cried like i was grieving and it was so heavy that i thought i was going to die\" \"a human body shouldn't be able to handle this much terror, is what i thought\" \"idk just. the physical memory is haunting me\"\n* The last time I ranted similarly was 16 days ago, though much more harsh and borderline manic. I'm cool with sharing that too; just didn't want to clutter this post too much.\n* I see the \"me\" from November and the \"me\" from now as separate people. Over text, I've spoken about the incident (after prefacing) because it feels more comfortable and natural to do so. I've texted something closely along the lines of, \"I just pity the \\[my name\\] from that day, more than anything.\"\n* I considered completely cutting off a friend I enjoyed talking to, simply because I'd first met them through people directly involved with the incident and couldn't help but be reminded of it every time I saw them. They've done nothing wrong.\n* I somehow feel a vague sense of comfort in knowing that the people who hate me rejoice in the fact that I've suffered. It feels as though for as long as they're able to find joy in my hurt, I shouldn't stop hurting. Genuinely, it makes me strangely happy, and I'm not sure what to make of this.\n* I feel a defiant anger towards those involved, more strongly as of recent because of conversations I've had with a third party who observed the whole situation first-hand, but at the same time I don't believe I have the right to. I don't know if I'm allowed to move on, because it would be selfish to do so. Moving on and healing is the opposite of taking responsibility for my actions, and I sometimes feel like the morally right thing to do is to continue hurting.\n\nAll that being said, I truly believe I'm doing an alright job of moving on. There's a lot I've come to terms with, the main one being that this situation was inevitable thanks to my lack of maturity, and that this was a wake-up call I've needed for a long time. I'm able to take pride in the way I handled the situation in the following week, and I've had people comment on my surprising display of maturity and my willingness to move on. Not too long ago, it feels like I'd really healed. But my regrets seem to be getting worse, and sometimes I relapse\u2013often late at night, like just now, and mourn the unfairness of it all. It's been 113 days and I wept over it just an hour ago. I'm so tired of having a memory as heavy as this. My friend said I've punished myself for long enough, and lord, I think I believe her. I don't want to hurt anymore.\n\n(Sorry\u2013I'm terribly sleep-deprived and will likely be horrified by the way I've written this when I wake up in the morning, haha. I'm also pretty unfamiliar with posting to Reddit, so do let me know if anything should be edited.)\n\nQ: At what point does trauma become PTSD? Am I experiencing real flashbacks?

I was a little overweight and my parents had a little money and spoiled me. I was never one to show off the nice things I had (I was raised to not brag) but it wasn\u2019t hard to spot the nice clothes or toys etc. A lot of people also knew which house I lived in which was a big house.\n\nSo this gave people a motive to go after me because of jealousy. I never understood it as a child because most of the kids who went after me also had parents with good jobs, many with more money than my parents. But now as an adult I know it was fueled by jealousy. I\u2019m also an only child (one of the only ones in my class) and although this sounds weird, I think some may have been jealous of that. \n\nI also have a name that is easy to change or make fun of. So much so that every boy in my graduating class had a different name then my own. Teachers thought it was funny and I would have to conversations with hs teachers asking them to not join in as I was not ok with it. \n\nBeginning in the 5th grade the bullying got so bad my mother was having meetings with the school on the regular. And I hate to say it but it eventually made me mean. But there is only so many times you can poke a bear before it bites.\n\nThese boys destroyed my self confidence. They never wanted to date me in silly middle school relationships. I never got asked to middle school dances. I didn\u2019t date in hs.\n\nMy sophomore year of hs I was asked to homecoming by a boy. Turns out it was all a joke and my French teacher who was very kind found out. I was then ask by another boy who took me. I thought it was because he liked me. No. It was because that teacher found out the first boy was just playing a joke and didn\u2019t want me to feel bad so she asked the other boy to take me.\n\nMy jr year of hs I was ask to prom. He looked at me and said \u201cdo you want to party after\u201d I didn\u2019t. \u201cGood we can go to prom\u201d It was so odd. Half way through prom he called him dad to pick him up because he was bored of me. I was dancing with friends and he just left. I found out in school on Monday that he spread rumors that I would not party or have sex with him so he dropped me.\n\nThese sort of events happened all the time till I finally gave up. I stopped trying or caring what boys thought. My friends constantly got into relationships and I stayed single.\n\nAnd this is just what the boys did. The girls had their own tactics.\n\nI hated them all by time I graduated. Built walls and didn\u2019t let them near me. I went to college hoping for a better life.\n\nAnd although I dated in college a few times I was never confident or comfortable. I was always waiting on the next shoe to drop and then laugh it my face and it was all a joke.\n\nSadly college boys think about one thing and one thing only when it comes to women. Sex. And I fell for it time and time again because I wanted someone to like me so badly. This destroyed me even further. I was told many times I was pretty enough to fuck but not date. My first bf in college wouldn\u2019t have sex with me because \u201cI wasn\u2019t attractive enough\u201d The second one knew of my confidence issues and used it against me sexually. So I gave up again and spent the rest of college focusing on school. \n\nWhat was really funny was the college I went to most of the people I went I hs with also went to. I didn\u2019t see the boys often but when I did they would want to sleep with me or something. I would turn them down every time because of how they had treated me growing up and they would get mad. Like I was the one in the wrong.\n\nNow I\u2019m getting closer and closer to 30 and the longest I\u2019ve dated someone is 5 months. Dating apps are horrible and I can\u2019t let these walls down because every time I do someone does these same childish things and reopens old scars. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m so far behind as my classmates get married and I just sit here. I\u2019ve talked to therapists who have given up on me. I do everything they ask. Open up, go on dates, etc etc just to be ghosted or told they just arnt interested. Many of the therapists don\u2019t get it either. But the state of dating is a mess anymore. \n\nI\u2019ve learned to me happy alone and not want anything more. My family is worried but I\u2019m not sure if I care anymore. Does it make me sad that I may never get married or have children? Sure. But I also won\u2019t let someone do that to me again. Being alone is better than constant rejection and being the butt of the joke.\n\nAny one else had this happen to them? Have you given up? Found someone? Something else?\n\nI really don\u2019t think people understand what you did as a child affect people well into adulthood.","upvote_ratio":0.72,"created_utc":1678378345.0},{"title":"Does anybody actually have the next 5-10 years of their life meticulously planned out?","author":"Phoenixdubz","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TooAfraidToAsk\/comments\/11mu920\/does_anybody_actually_have_the_next_510_years_of\/","text":"Asking because I feel like I have a vague idea of where I want to be and hopes and dreams but not an exact step by step road map as yet.

I have an office job that pays me well and I work basically 9-5. I have a partner that is also in their 30s and makes even more than I do, also works 9-5. We do not have children but we do have a cat and a dog. We own our house and are generally doing well financially. No real debt other than the house mortgage. Throwaway because I'm embarrassed and depressed about the situation. \n\nI've been really baffled recently by how other people seem to live life without feeling burnt out all the time. I think that my partner and I are generally normal people that are pretty decent at getting things done. We don't have a huge social life, but so enjoy seeing family and friends every few weeks. Recently I just feel like our day to day is exhausting and it has no reason to be. Is this just adulthood? \n\nExample: one of us walks the dog in the morning around 7:30 or 8:00 before we commute into work, we work 9-5, and then once we're home one of us usually makes dinner while the other goes to the gym. By the time all of this is done it's usually 9, and I only have about an hour or two of time to do anything else (relax, play with pets take care of personal stuff, shower, etc) I've even done things to try to optimize our time, like plan our weeknight meals in advance and get our groceries delivered weekly so we don't have to think about it during the week. \n\nOn the weekend we have some time to recharge, but frequently have to see family (about an hour away for both of us, which is usually a several hour event) or take care of things around the house (for example, we just had major flooding in our city due to unprecedented rain and we have some very minor repairs that have to be made to our garage) all of these things feel like work, and I don't feel like I have any time for fun. Even if we do have time, I feel so tired from the rest of the week that I don't want to do anything. Maybe I am naive to think I should have time to enjoy my life. Is this normal?\n\nI honestly don't know how we are expected to do all of these seemingly routine, adult things and still live a balanced and non-stressful life. Every day feels like it's rushed, packed, and needs to be carefully planned in order to happen without issue. This has left us both feeling constantly overwhelmed and exhausted. I don't remember feeling like this pre-COVID tbh, but our routine seems generally similar as it was before.\n\nHow do other people deal with this? Is everyone just exhausted and stressed all the time? How do you find time to do anything fun or feel relaxed? We have been discussing the potential for children in the future, but honestly don't know how we could manage it considering how behind we feel in life as it is. Adding another responsibility to the mix seems like a recipe for misery.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678385693.0},{"title":"?
