        "text": "PROLOUGE:\nBefore it left a few days ago, there has been news of an ongoing standoff between two nations' navy near the port of where the ship is going to trade, Red and Blue nation. When the ship arrived about a dozen miles from port, they are greeted to the sight of the Red Navy to their right and the Blue Navy to the left. \n\nRULES AND CLUES:\nThe merchant ship's captain is pressured on this particular trip. Onboard the ship are crateloads of tea leaves the the captain is willing to sell at the port for a huge profit. The reason why the captain is pressure by such an offer is that if he doesn't sell the tea in time, the company that offered his ship will go bust, and will be forced to sell his ship to counter it's loss.\nThis means that turning around and heading home with the load unsold is not an option. \n\nThe merchant ship is unarmed and unarmored.\n\nThe navies back at the harbour are nervous about each others presence, and are willing to fire at any ships that cross their path. That means they will fire at any ships that isn't their's at the stretch of open water between the navies. Take note that the merchant ship is unarmed and unarmored, thus will be blown into bits if it attempts to pass through. \n\nFinally, neither navies have spotted the merchant ship yet, so the captain fortunately has time to think of his next move. \n\nRIDDLE:\nHowever, a crew member onboard came up with an ingenious plan, and the ship made it to port untouched and without A SINGLE shot fired by either Navy. \n\nNow the question is how? \n\n\n\n\n",

For those of you familiar with zest riddle, crux, notpron, synchronicity, etc. It is a lot like those. Solving those first will make this riddle easier.\n\nUnlike zest however, this riddle is creative based, so those with logical minds must reject them in order to progress through this riddle.\n\nThe riddle acts like an enchanted forest maze - with paths that leads to other paths, hints that could apply to more than one page, paths that lead to nowhere, and multiple paths that join up together.\n\nThe forest guardians job is to prevent you from progressing and finding all the secrets, and to keep you lost.\n\nThere are also many secrets hidden in this game.. some paths lead to entirely hidden riddlesets all contained within themselves. Some examples are the negative levels, the bizarro levels, the letter levels etc.\n\n-----\n\nHidden through chron riddles are artifacts. At some point these artifacts will become useful at some point on every riddle page. Artifacts hidden in negative levels will be applicable only to positive levels, and vice versa - any artifacts found anywhere else will be able to be used on any part of the riddle. \n\nyou would use such an artifact if you were say on level 1, which is enter.html, and you put say enter-artifact1.html and it would bring up a secret page. So remember - the level, the word, appended to the level.\n\nSome artifacts can be used in every single directory and only need to have their name entered, like artifact.html and it will bring you to a central page no matter what level you are on.\n\n-----\n\nThere are also secrets peppered throughout.. some which would make your riddling easier. There are currently 5 secret pages hidden in the game. Artifact pages are not included as secret pages, even if they are hidden.\n\nAlso feel free to chat us up on our [Discord Page!](https://discord.gg/zuPYhJk) - you can ask for hints there\n\n- shawn (chronamut) -",
