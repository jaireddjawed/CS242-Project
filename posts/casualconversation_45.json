        "text": "I fell asleep on the couch earlier while watching TV. I had the most realistic and vivid dream, that's what I'm going to assume it was. It was like I was awake,  on my couch, the TV program on, but I couldn't fully wake up. Like I couldn't make my eyes open or stay open, I tried to move and couldn't move, I tried to yell for my husband and couldn't,  it's like I was paralyzed,  a prisoner in my own body. I kept having this same scenario repeat over and over . I would try to look at my phone to see if it was time to pick up my daughter at 2:40 from school, but the phone would say 5pm and my daughter wasn't here, my husband didn't get her, but I couldn't yell out for him. I could hear the TV program playing and kept trying to open my eyes to watch it, and it's like my eyes would somewhat open but I'd be sucked back into sleep. I don't know how, but I finally woke up for real. Looked at my phone and realized it was only lunch and I'd only been asleep maybe an hour. It took a moment to get all my senses and bearings together and I've felt sick since then, not hungry,  nothing . Has anybody ever had anything like this happen to you?? The brain is a master of tricks!",

But I was miserable, I spend my time playing video games to avoid pain or regretting/replaying the past in my head, I was obsessed with my Dream Uni and my dream girl even tho we agreed to stop communicating until I got over it\n\nThe start of this year was a bit better, even if I had low motivation, I had some ambition to get into this dream Uni and I started to stop thinking about this girl\n\nBut the true electric shocks were this week.\n\n1) I agreed with her to start meeting again.\n\nDuring a phone call, I learned she was in a new couple and that she was starting her 2nd internship in a great lab, I was very happy for her but It also made me realise that even if she was still the same person, she advanced in life while I stayed stagnant during 1.5 years. \n\n2) I realised that I was living as if life was a video game, I was just waiting the opportunity to get back to an equivalent of 3years back, when I met her\n\nAt this point I understood what was the meaning of \"live\" in kind of in Nietzsche's way\n\nNow I have new ambitions for my Master Degree that fit my desires and not to replenish a past loss\nI want to get back to fitness, continue to learn German I started this year, get my Driving license, maybe start learning harp if I have time to, and most of all, I want to meet new friends and have a new healthy relationship\n\nLove you all, tell me about your revelations and how it went.\n\nTldr: The thought that really lighted the spark for me was when at 2 am I went \"life is not a game\" in the sense there is no way to get back to a previous check point",

        "text": "Let me tell you the story in a nutshell:\n\nIt was the spring of 2021; I met a girl on Facebook she sent me the first message and we both live in the same city. Things were going well as we talked about ourselves and shared our thoughts and feelings. She was giving me strong indications that she was into me, I liked her too but I didn't know how to progress and I wasn't in a good mental condition so I let it go like this. One day 2 weeks before our exam she posted something tagging me saying that \"well now we got our exam routine, so it's time to study hard and don't expect anything.\" Since that day she started to show less interest in me, she was replying too late and then all of a sudden she stopped messaging me. Maybe it was my fault I never sent her or even anyone a message first. Days passed, I was in severe depression because of what was going on in my life, my parents got divorced, my one and only best friend broke up our 10 years of friendship and I literally had no one to share what was going on in my life. I was a quiet kid from childhood who had no friends, who used to live inside his house all the time because he wasn't allowed to go and play with other kids. My childhood experiences contributed a lot to my downfall. All I saw was domestic violence and hatred. I was about to kill myself.\n\nIt's the month of December 2022. She came up to me saying \"hey how are you?\" then I shared everything that was happening in my life. She said, \"All you need is love, you need to be loved by someone because you never experienced it nor your parents loved you\". Then the past started repeating itself, she started to show interest in me again and she even offered me to go on a date with her. I was still traumatized so I wasn't responding to her as I used to be. she become bored with me, and then one day she started talking about love and rejection, that day I found out that she was in a relationship with a college guy 4 years older than her, she showed interest in me because that guy dumped her. I was just an option. Then again she started ghosting me and cutted off contact with no explanation.\n\nAgain, today she messaged me saying \"sorry for not replying\" should I move on and let her go? I literally have no friends, not even a single one. Sorry for my bad English.",

        "text": "I'm posting this here because I'm not looking for any advice or sympathy or anything, it's just an interesting observation I made. People on Reddit like to say TikTok sucks because of the content or the type of people on it, but I don't think they realize that there's just as much content and people like that on Reddit too, it's just harder to come by due to how subreddits and upvoting works on this site.\n\nI got addicted to TikTok almost immediately after I download it, maybe a couple days after at most. Since then, almost every day has involved me waking up, scrolling on TikTok for at least two hours in bed, then finally getting out of bed once I got bored. I tried putting a timer on it, but I would always just increase it every time I reached the limit. \n\nIt's just so incredibly stimulating. Reddit is the same, but to a much much lesser extent. My brain's being constantly bombarded with music, video, action, color, etc... when I'm on TikTok. There's also no clear stopping point on TikTok because of the infinite scrolling, it's so easy to lose track of time and they know this because it keeps people on the app. (I use a 3rd party Reddit app so I don't know if infinite scrolling is present on the official app too. RiF has it, but it tells you every time you've scrolled past a 'page' so it's way easier to stop once you think you've scrolled enough.)\n\nI ended up wasting hours of my day doing nothing in bed, and by the time I got up I felt like I didn't have time to do the activities that took effort that I actually wanted to do. It's just way too easy to open your phone and watch short 10, 30 second, or 1 minute videos, and move onto the next one when you get bored. Especially when the algorithm is catering to your interests and showing you exactly what you wanna see.\n\nI eventually convinced myself to delete it, but not for this reason, solely because I thought I was spending too much time on it, but getting out of bed faster has been an incidental, but incredible side effect to deleting TikTok, and has made me feel so so much better lately. The way I combated the craving to scroll TikTok was just by using YouTube Shorts instead, and if you've ever used YouTube Shorts you'd know it's fucking terrible, so after a few days it led me to stopping completely.\n\nI still have issues with being dependent on my phone, especially when I wake up. Eventually I plan to sleep with my phone in a different room so I'm forced to get out of bed before I can check my phone, but I don't think I'm quite ready for that yet. Right now I'm just happy with the progress I've made.",

We have a few people we treat as special because they're loved ones. So how do you reconcile that in your own mind? Do you think only you and the people you love and a few other \"exceptional\" people are special? I think that's probably closer to the true way people feel, not what they say. They say everyone's special when it's convenient. It's what we'd like to believe, but we don't act like it really. We just say it to make ourselves feel better about the world.",

You cannot lower it without making sure all the feet are out of the way, but he did.

I could be easily considered like a target or a showoff and it's not really like you have to make 7 figures and be a 10/10 or you're not worthy of a miligram of attention at all (even if it's starting to become the case), just wanted some more info on that.\n\nThanks in advance for your answers !",

        "text": "Hello fellow Redditers, I hope you are all well.\n (My apologies if this is not allowed here. I just thought I could make it work.)\n\n for you to fit in my shoes here's some minor jnfo.\nI'm 21/M.  Friend is 22/m. We've been friends on and off for years. Since I was single digits. 9yo or so if I remember correctly. We grew up together in the same project area, and have always gotten along really well. Both hung around the same friend group for the most part and spent many hours hanging out. Was always good times in the adolescent years.\n\nNow to current.\nI was talking to him today about a debatable topic that we really didn't agree on at all, and I suddenly realized how incredibly huge both myself and his egos truly can be at points. Neither him or I wanted to admit we were wrong. \n\nTowards the end of the conversation he brought up a couple  more previous conversations we also didn't agree on again. I realized suddenly when he did that he just wanted to feel like he was right instead of debating the main point. So I ended the conversation and kind of scolded him for criticizing me for the way I was thinking. That was wrong of me to do. I'm a hypocrite by even saying that. Right?\n\n\n i kind of realized at the end of the day we are sitting here bickering about stuff neither of us have a background in other then what we can google. We are just letting our egos get the best of us that way we can feel superior. I was deep into an argument pretty much before I caught myself. I sat there pacing in my room because I felt myself pulling back into the argument and I wasn't going to. Is this a common problem for people? \n\n\nThis kinda caused me to spiral down a thought path that wanted to know why I felt like I needed to be right, and it honestly really made me uncomfortable and rethink a lot of different moments I've had in life. Which made me want to ask some older wiser people for a healthy response to handle that information. I don't want to be an egotistical a**hole in life. So I want advice from anyone willing to pass any down\n\nIt's to the point for the most part we(and a lot of my younger friends) don't see that eye to eye anymore. Saddens me because I like this person as a friend, but I feel like we are both a drain to each other. Like a toxic relationship if you will.\nDo most people feel the need to move on from their childhood friends after so long?  \n\nIf yha made it this far and have anything. Thank you kindly. Feels free to say anything or ask anything. I will be vague for anonymity tho",

It didnt look good, and some guys on reddit said I should shave. Thats what I did. I heard it grows thicker post shave aswell, so I was hoping that it would grow thicker and more visible. After shabin, I didnt feel too bad at first, but now I really miss my beard even though it wasnt a fully grown one at the time. I didnt expect it go be growing this slow, but yet again, its only been a week. I just want it to grow back rn man. This is why I dont like shaving that much. I miss my beard. Beards makes a man look more masculine, and alot of women like it.\n\n It also makes a man look more mature. Once there was a woman who usually saw her husband with a beard. Then when he clean-shaved it, she told him to grow it back immediately. This means that if it werent for that beard, that man wouldnt have gotten that relationship.",

They keep breaking down because no one has time to clean them properly. McDonald's even started sending managers to seminars just to learn how to clean it. And once you start taking it apart to clean, there are dozens of individual parts. It's a nightmare hassle machine that McDonald's hasn't figured out an easier way to keep clean and working properly. So don't be sad when you can't get ice cream at McDonald's, be pleasantly surprised when you can. But if you can, also be kind of sketched out wondering if the machine has been cleaned properly.",

Talking to my family calms me down but when I go back to my job, the same feeling comes back.\n\nMy sole method to manage stress is not working here, Earlier I used to manage my stress by accepting the worst case scenario.\n\nSo I said to myself that the worst they can do is fire me, not kill me, which gave me some comfort but then my anxious mind thought that If I get fired from here and go to a different company and I face a similar situation there as well, then what will I do.\n\nThe IT market right now is hell bent on firing people not hiring, so I feel like I'm trapped in a cage.

        "text": "So here I am, back in my cold home country, after finishing my trip to Thailand. I don't know what it is, but I just don't feel like stressing about things anymore, you know? \n\nNow that I'm back, I have a job to worry about, doing my master's at the same time... and not focusing on my own passion and interests. \n\nSomething which I realised after my trip is that maybe life is not really that complicated and I shouldn't stress about stuff. Honestly I'd like to take a leave from the university and maybe focus on my own passions, one of which is making music. I haven't really focused on it for the past 10 years and I feel like I'm in some kind of a rut... \n\nI'd like to experience a meaningful relationship, focus some time on music and maybe do something else as well. All of which I haven't done or experienced these past 10 years. I mean, just a year more and I'll be turning 30 - and I haven't really lived.\n\nOr maybe this is all just some kind of post-travel blues, yet at the same time I feel like these 2 past weeks when I was away from my comfort zone, I did some internal reflections and realised that maybe I'm just not happy with how things are right now.\n\nHas anyone else felt like that? How have you dealt with these kind of emotions?",

It is, in my inexpert estimation, an ex-Mac.\n\nUnderstandably he's quite emotionally attached to this thing, but was surprisingly stoic this afternoon, albeit visibly affected. What should we do?\n\n- Let him suffer through a break. It'll be good for his mental health, Roblox and YouTube are far too toxic, and he has a Switch Lite to entertain him, anyway. Let's be honest, he was lucky it fell into his hands in the first place. (Cheapest)\n\n- Repurpose an ancient laptop or such with a second-hand monitor so he can at least check his emails and play old Java Minecraft builds... Maybe.\n\n- Bring the iMac in for repairs. It has an SSD in it and ran well til it broke, and the screen is brilliant.  Shame to waste it!\n\n- Replace the iMac on the second-hand market; they're available, if not always cheap, and the SSD could possibly be transferred straight over - as if it never happened! \n\n- Build him a budget gaming PC. If he's going to be a gamer, he better do it properly. And at least I can easily diagnose and repair a PC myself...\n\nHave I missed anything? What would you do? Why?",

Everything from the riffs, the production, Maynard's vocals made for one of the most mind-blowing pieces of music I've heard in a long time.\n\nSo, naturally I decided to listen to their other albums as well, and was also pleasantly surprised as well. They've become one of my new favorite bands and I use them for motivation while going out for bike rides, doing assignments for college, etc. they've really helped me push forward in a time where I was about to burn out. \n\nSo in short, Tool is *really* fucking good.\n\nWhat do you think about Tool?",

With us spending more and more time on social media I think that a person‚Äôs typing style can have a pretty significant influence on how people perceive their personality.\n\n I‚Äôve definitely noticed that I make judgments on people based on how they type and a  friend recently told me her roommate was actually really warm in person even though she seemed cold to her over text because she never used any exclamation point or smiley faces, this was not a serious evaluation at all and mainly a joke but still it made me wondering about how my texting/typing voice is different from my real one. Like I have one friend who is very bubbly in person but literally anyone who knows her will tell you she‚Äôs the driest texter ever. This girl will respond with ‚Äúok‚Äù to a question she would have answered in person with an ‚Äúoh my god!‚Äù followed by enthusiastic and repeated affirmatives. I also have a friend who texts in a way that sounds just like him though, I can imagine how he would say it in person perfectly it‚Äôs like I hear him speaking to me when I read his texts. I can imagine my dry text friend saying ‚Äúok‚Äù in her voice of course but a text conversation doesn‚Äôt feel like really talking to them while with some people it just works. \n\nI think most conversations are in the middle though, texting is limiting by principle, but normally it isn‚Äôt so starkly different from how they talk that you notice. I‚Äôve noticed some small differences  in myself like I normally type ‚Äúthank you!!‚Äù and ‚Äúnp!‚Äù when I would just say ‚Äúoh thank you‚Äù calmly in person and not in a peppy way. I also use ‚Äúy‚Äôall‚Äù relatively frequently when texting but I am a ‚Äúyou guys‚Äù person 100% in person, I have no idea where it came from. I‚Äôve also probably typed out ‚ÄúLMFAOO‚Äù hundreds of times but I don‚Äôt think Ive ever said that phrase out loud once. \n\nThis was longer than I thought it would be but it‚Äôs just cool to think about for me and I‚Äôm wondering if you guys (y‚Äôall) think you sound like yourselves over text/online?",

Size ‚â† mass, mass is basically just the weight, black holes are very dense, and can be the size of an everyday object, yet be capable of swallowing planets.\n\nSo this black hole would technically pose no threat to us, because it's basically the solar system's second Jupiter. It's a body that's several times more massive than our own planet, and it has an effect on the asteroid belt on the outskirts of our solar system, that's about it.\n\nAre you worried, neutral, or intrigued about this?",

        "text": "So for me, the past two years have been devoted to a lot of personal growth. It's been a painful ride, but vital, and one of the most important things I've devoted myself to is developing meaningful friendships. In my mind, meaningful friendships are about showing up, being consistent and showing love in tangible ways. I put in the work for a while, and obviously there are times where people are busier, but on the whole, I have found people to care about in my city who're worth the effort.\n\nOne of my oldest friends in this city (I've been here since 2018), my former neighbor, is a great person. We don't see each other as often as some of my other friends, but we've had a solid friendship and I still consider her a close friend. We share cute videos back and forth essentially daily, and when we meet we have a good time. Her and her fiance have included me in a lot of things, and even set up a trip to another city with their friends because they knew I wanted to go there, just so they could show me around.\n\nSo speaking of this fiance. A few weeks ago, I was over at their place to have dinner with them. Imagine my surprise when they decide to share with me, before any of their other friends who've known them longer and almost their entire family (only her sister knew before me), that they're finally getting married after ten years together. I knew this was a tense issue in their relationship before and how much relief she must feel that they've finally come to an agreement, and I was honestly really happy for them, since he's my friend too. I was SO honored that they told me first, that they trusted me with this information and their happiness. It made me feel closer to them.\n\nFast forward to today (we've met once since to go to a show she invited me to months in advance, which was also really sweet), and I'm sick at home with covid, though I haven't told her. She texts me to share that she would like my opinion on her wedding dress, since she's buying it second hand online. I gave my opinion on the options she showed me and suggested some styling ideas I found online, since I knew her vision and I'm into makeup and the likes. I agreed with her favorite pick and she went for it! I was honored again to be included in that process. And then, when I casually mentioned I got covid, she asked why I didn't tell her and said she's available anytime to bring me some chicken soup if I need it, and not to hesitate to ask. \n\nHonestly, this is a good friend. Not to mention some of my other friends have already offered to bring me anything if I need it, and several family members have checked in, as well as my best friend back home who's essentially another sister. I just feel very loved. Even though I'm lonely often because I live alone in a foreign country and I'm single, it helps to know I've chosen some good people to have in my life. Putting in actual effort and risking getting hurt or disappointed is the only way to do this, but it's SO worth it.",

        "text": "Ok so. You've seen the title. This is just what's happening in my life and stuff I want to talk about. If you're not interested, keep scrolling. \n\n\nI'll start with a big one. I play on a volleyball team, and I love volleyball, but right now I hate playing. This isn't because I've lost interest or anything like that, it's because of the coach. His coaching style is mentally draining and after every play, even if we get the point, he's looking for someone to single out and tell them to do better. He'll ignore the 5 good passes I made in a row but get upset when I make a mistake the next play. What this does is make the players nervous, because they don't want to mess up in fear of getting yelled at (mid-game, might I add). And, of course, when we're nervous, we don't play well, he gets upset, the cycle repeats. Apparently the parents have talked and said that everyone else feels the same as I do, and if he's the coach next year most people (including myself) will not be returning. I have a tournament Saturday and I just have no motivation to play. \n\n\nOk. That's the main thing that adds stress to my life. These other things are much smaller but still things happening in my life. \n\n\nI should mention I'm still in high school, so this may seem childish. Anyways, surprise surprise, there's this girl. I don't share any of my classes with her, the only reason I met her is because we played on the same volleyball intermural team (just playing for fun during our lunch break). I see her almost every day in the halls, and I don't know what it is, I get flustered and I become nervous, I can't think straight, all that stuff. I can't get over her looks too, she's just visually stunning and genuinely one of the best looking people I've ever seen. I doubt she even remembers I exist though. I've conversed with her on Instagram a bit but not a whole lot. Every time I see her talking with her friends, she's always smiling and laughing and looks so positive and cheerful, it's great. \n\nNow, me one of my closest friends have a little bit of a history where I like someone, so do they, and the girl likes him. This has happened 2-3 times. And I've seen him talking to this girl too, so he obviously knows her more than I do. And my friend is one of those people who can get with anyone without even trying, everyone just likes him. I'm not sure how he feels about her but it still makes me jealous and I hate that I feel like that. \n\n\nThis is probably gonna be the last thing. \n\nI'm not sure why, but every now and then I just have the urge to leave my friend group and just be by myself, I feel like I'd be happy and calm like that. However, I know my friends are awesome and when actually thinking about it I would never do something like that. Sometimes I just want to talk to people or say something to someone but I don't because I worry my friends will judge or tease me relentlessly. I don't know why it bothers me but it sorta feels like I'm getting held back from doing things I want to do. \n\n\nAnyways, yeah. Thank you for reading. This isn't a real important post, I just wanted to talk about these things somewhere.",

For years since I've started drinking this stuff, I've taken it black. Rarely, with milk, but never sugar. That's just the fastest way to get the coffee in my gut and the caffeine into my bloodstream so I would drink from pitcher to mouth if I needed. Recently, however, I've been putting some milk in my cup because I guess I've felt I've been drinking more bitter coffee. Same grounds as usual, a dark roast. But the real Cameron Fyre moment of self reflection came when I found myself putting a pinch of sugar in too and stirring the whole thing. Granted, it tastes a lot better this way, but when I drink a cup black now I feel like I've had a change of taste. I still like it, but less than I used to. So, has coffee gotten more bitter or is my tongue playin tricks on me? I've got to know.",
