They are an expert in matter manipulation and skilled in the clandestine arts. The discovery of these talents occurred in their youth when they infiltrated and stole the Prima Materia from the Great Library. It has never been recovered.\n\nWarm and empathetic, they speak only when they need to, preferring to take their time in all things and commune with their beloved trees which grow around the summit of Al Tanoor. They are responsible for keeping Al Tanoor hidden from the outside world and teaching alchemy using the medicine of plants. There are whispered rumours in Al Tanoor that their wandering soul isn’t human at all but something far more ancient.\n\nThe Gran-Preceptor of Al Tanoor and the oldest, most powerful Alchemist that has ever lived... not that you’d know it from their personality. Eccentric, excitable but acutely perceptive, nothing ever seems to come as a surprise to them. They also have a bizarre sense of humour they would call, an acquired taste.\n\nWho are we?",

        "text": "The answer is......(apparently) &gt;!A Hole!&lt; \n\nMost of you will know the above answer, but in the off chance that you don't, spoliers ahead....\n\nWhy the big post about something so meanial? I guess I want to be that nitpicking killjoy; the one who can ruin someones moment in the most pathetic, \"small man\" way one can be. The man who can walk away from the moment thinking he is a smart arse, while everyone else whispers to themselves...\"Who  was that dickhead\". \n\nAnyway, onto the question that will leave you thinking, \"that's 5 minutes of my life I won't get back\"... \n\n&gt;!So to be hypercritical of the way the riddle is worded, imagine the \"hole\" in this riddle was represented as a black paper circle on a white table. In this scenario, if you were to take away from the hole, as in rip a piece of the black paper circle away; The hole is not getting bigger. The hole is in fact getting smaller the more you take away from it. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!What if the hole was real hole, in say a bucket or a barrel? I would say that its still the same result. I mean, if you were to take more of the barrel away from where the hole is, THEN the hole will be getting bigger the more you take away from it,  \"it\" being the barrel. But thats not how its worded is it?!&lt;\n\n&gt;!If you take anything away from the hole in any circumstance, it is in fact getting smaller. Imagine like the greatest of all the holes, the \"black hole\", you would agian be making the hole smaller. You remove mass from a black hole, you would be reducing the size of the black hole. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!So to finish off; how could you word this riddle in order to deliver the same head-scratching effect in a just as \"punchy\" and seemingly contradictory set of words?!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Or, is there anything other than a \"hole\" that you could replace as the answer to the riddle? If worded in the same way in the posts title? Is there anyting physical or metaphysical in existance which does in fact get bigger, the more you take away from it?!&lt;",

When Mr. Logfinder, having forgotten the number,  asks a passer-by if he knows where Mr. Cache lives. Instead of answering, the passer-by suggests they play a puzzle.  Mr.  Logfinder likes puzzles and therefore accepts this.  \"You must ask three indirect questions\", says the stranger.\n\nMr.  Logfinder thinks about it and then asks these three questions:\n\n   1) In which block lives Mr.  Cache?\n   2) Is the number even?\n   3) Is the number a square number?\n\nAfter answering his three questions, Mr. Logfinder: \"I'm still in doubt, but if you tell me if there's a 4 in the number, then I'm sure!\"\n\nMr.  Logfinder gets the answer and runs to the house, where he now believes that his friend Mr.  Cache lives, but when he rings the doorbell of the apartment, it is opened by a strange man.  Mr.  Logfinder describes to the man the passerby from whom he got his information, after which the man begins to laugh and says, \"You got your information from the biggest liar in town. He never tells the truth.\"  Mr.  Logfinder is thinking now for a while and then says, \"Thanks, now I know where Mr. Cache lives!\"\n\nEND\n\n(There is an accompanying picture where it shows 10 apartment blocks on the left and 5 apartment blocks on the right)\n\nThis is a puzzle to a geocache and I’m stumped, any help is appreciated 👍🏻",
