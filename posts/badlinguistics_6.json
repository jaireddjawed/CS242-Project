        "text": "[The Tower of Babel account affirmed by linguistics](https://creation.com/the-tower-of-babel-account-affirmed-by-linguistics)\n\nIt is bad linguistics because the failure to reconstruct a proto-world does not give positive evidence of a Tower of Babel event.\n\nI will follow with some choice quotes:\n\n&gt;The fact remains that the Greek/Sanskrit parent was utterly consistent, and highly sophisticated. If chance, then, did not make this Proto Language, where did it get its consistency from? The only credible explanation is found in Genesis 11. It suggests a Designer. In Babel one of the groups was given the sophisticated, and utterly consistent, Proto Indo-European language.\n\nMost languages get their consistency from speakers' limited memory and skill at generalization.\n\n\n&gt;it seems odd to believe in those ‘aeons of linguistic history’, without any evidence, unless one takes the evolution theory for granted, as he does. The evidence indicates otherwise.\n\nAeons of (linguistic) history are independently supported by archeological evidence.\n\n\n&gt;Clearly distinguishable families however, continue to puzzle secular linguists, who generally believe languages evolved naturally, as these distinctions are not consistent with the expectations their hypotheses demand.\n\nSecular linguists don't find it puzzling.\n",

For example, a work by Bansky should \"technically\" be called a *graffito* since it's a single piece, and therefore not plural.   Since the word is Italian, *graffiti* should only be used as the plural.\n\nNow I'm pretty sure this is not the standard usage anywhere expect for the most pedantic of people, but I don't have a great argument as to why it isn't more common.   I'm perfectly happy to accept it if people are using it, but that's just not the case.  But, linguistically (or etymologically) why is the singular **not** *graffito*?\n\n",
