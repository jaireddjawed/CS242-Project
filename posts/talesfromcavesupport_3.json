Ughag still remember even after old-Ughag go forever sleep after hunt gone bad. \n\nMany and many winters and moons ago, so many that one no can count with hands and feet, was tribe with big chief. Big chief name was King.\n\nChief King was good chief. Strong and good hunter. Tribe happy with chief King. But chief King different: he want be more than chief. He want be chief of all chiefs!\n\nSo chief King set trap for chiefs of other tribe. Make war with other tribe. Club everyone who comes in chief King way. Chief King become chiefs of chief. So since now no other chiefs, no need call chief anymore. He become just King.\n\nEveryone think King strong and good and live happy for one and one and one winter. But after many winter King is weak and old. Start make bad think. No more good King! But what do? No one is good for chief anymore, because no one else was chief for many winters.\n\nWhen teeth of King fall and King go forever sleep, tribe no know what do. Tribe lost and confused. No know how organize hunt. No know how store berry juice in cold cave. Many go forever sleep. After one winter, tribe split in one and one. Then tribe split again and again. Then new cave men and women become new chiefs, and tribe no more lost and confused.\n\nSo all tribes learn King no good, but is better to have many chiefs.",
