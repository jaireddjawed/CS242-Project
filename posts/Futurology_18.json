We can see that these networks, with enough training, are capable of assessing complex inputs and produce corresponding outputs. That's what intelligence is at the fundamental level. And complex intelligence is just the combination of many rudimentary intelligent systems working together.   \n\n\nThe key is that the human brain has many regions each in charge of specific functions whereas chatgpt represents only two primary functions - memory and speech. Once other specialised AIs in charge of other functions - like critical thinking, complex analysis, emotions, etc -  are created and integrated together, we'll see a truly self-conscious AI.   \n\n\nThere are many companies already working on these systems. We know that chatgpt has already passed the medical licensing exam and the Bar, something that the majority of people can't.   \n\n\nI honestly think ChatGPT is a major stepping stone to truly conscious AI. It is actually intelligent, but just at a lower level because it's missing some key functions. Additionally, AI doesn't have to be right 100% of the time and super smart, it just needs to beat the average person.",

        "text": "AI to me is just good marketing for \"automation\". And automation has existed since agriculture and earlier. Rather than having to find and identify plants, you simply have them all in the same area, uniformly distanced apart for harvest.\n\nIf AI was truly intelligent, it would have to have a mind of its own. But the problem with having a mind of its own, is that there are an infinite number of things that it can do. Within those infinite things there's a subset that is also infinite of **unuseful** things to do. Keep in mind that there's also an infinite subset of **useful** things to do. But the unuseful subset is **uncountably** larger than the useful subset.\n\nI'm saying this because if we If you don't tell AI what to do, it won't kill people. That's too specific. Instead it might decide to rotate for 2.3 million years, then go straight for 1 second, and then pick up a stick, and then count the carbon molecules in the stick, and then rotate for 2521 seconds.\n\nMy point is that AI is not intelligent, it doesn't decide what to do. We tell it what to do; it's automation.",

Sensors are important, but it became apparent that there are 2 essential steps to that will lead us to self driving vehicles.   \n\n\n1. In order to solve full self-driving properly, you actually just have to solve real world AI. (this is actually a quote from someone you might know :))   \n2. As Level 5 autonomous driving is far away, the main focus right now is to have a fleet that continuously trains the AI model, which means that you over time.  \n\n\nStep 1 is super hard to achieve and the main reason for it is, that you really need to take a HUGE amount of factors into account when driving. It requires much more than AI can deliver right now.  \n\n\nI think that a lot of Tesla owners ask themselves why Radar and ultrasonic sensors have been removed. I believe the answer lies in that you can invest heavily in sensors, but then you might not obtain \"the fleet\" that will train your AI model.       \n\n\nTaking everything into consideration, we are probably somewhere between Level 2 (Partial Driving Automation) and Level 3 (Conditional Driving Automation). We have a long way to go before we reach Level 5 (Full Driving Automation).  \n\n\nWhat is your take on it? Looking forward to hear your point of view:)!",
