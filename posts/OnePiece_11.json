I believe he is dead and will be forgotten but id really like to see him back or have his devil fruit come back, I also think his decisions on Onigashima were very dumb.

Bit what if a human eats this fruit do they become more human? No firstly using the most notible transformation, monster point, my belief is that this is actually the giant form of the fruit. I believe that each of his transformationa is actually a representation of one of the Humanoid races. His eyes may also be connected to mihawk and showing that mihawk is of the eagle eye tribe or something that users can see the weakspots of oponents kinda like the opening thread of demon slayer. So in turn its not a human as in human its human as in humanoids.  Hes a raindeer rather then a human so rather then having the normal human aspects of the fruit theyre slightly altered",

        "text": "Here we go again with one of the most disputed matchups. Recently i have seen a lot of people saying King stomps on Katakuri. Evidently the main argument is  \"Katakuri cant damage king \"  blabla. What makes me laugh is people as much as they like to talk about the lunarian durability never mention the fact that is has a weakness. Lunarians can be damaged by anyone who can make them turn their flames of. And someone like katakuri can do that if he know his weakness. \n\nNow let me flip the coin . The same way king has a hax, katakuri has too. His future sight coupled with his devil fruit makes him near untouchable. Did you guys forget how invincible katakuri seemed when he was fighting luffy. The same way people were saying  people are saying how king can be damaged , it can be aske how katakuri can be touched. But ultimately, the same way lunarian dna has weaknesse, katakuri's future sight has weaknesses too. \n\n\nUltimately between the one who can't be damaged vs the one who can be touched, the winner is whoever can discover and exploit the weakness of the other. This is a close matchup that can go either way depending on the situation. There is no stomp on either side.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/11pl8ao/a_theory_on_the_ancient_kingdomvoid_century/",
        "text": "With the Ancient Kingdom getting a bit of love from Oda in the latest arc, I've found myself mulling over a few things about the ancient past of One Piece. And while we are still waiting on answers, I think I may have an idea of where we are going. I'm gonna split this up into a couple of sections, talking about the core theory, some speculation related to the theory, and some ideas about how this might connect to events we're seeing and might see in the future. \n\n\n#Chapter 1: The Theory\n\nSee, one thing has always struck me about the void century, and Joyboy's participation in particular. Namely, that Joyboy is painted as a revolutionary figure - Zunesha likens the sound of his heartbeat to \"the drums of revolution\". But the story of the void century is that a group of countries went to war with an ancient kingdom and destroyed it, then formed the world government. This is usually generally thought of as a bad thing, what with the WG hiding evidence of this ancient civilization's existence. But that raises the question - who was Joyboy revolting against?\n\nWell, we know that the 20 kingdoms rose up to destroy the ancient kingdom, and we know that the Lunarians were considered a tribe of \"Gods\" living on the Red Line, a status echoed by the celestial dragons today. (Whitebeard refers to the \"Kami no Kuni\" where Mary Geoise now stands^[1] ) We also know that the World Government is pretty keen to capture/kill all of the Lunarians, offering 100M berry for any Lunarian. It's pretty clear that the WG does not want Lunarians out in the wild.\n\nWith all that said, here's the outline of my idea - 800 years ago, the Lunarians formed an oppressive empire, much like the WG today. I suspect that they either arrived or suddenly became more interested in world conquest 800 years ago, but the reasons for that are much more speculative, so I'll include those at the end. Either way, during this time, Joyboy appears. He acts as sort of a prototype for what we see Luffy doing today - he travels all around the world, making friends and allies, freeing slaves, and generally becoming a major thorn in the side of the Lunarians. \n\nAfter a while, Joyboy manages to inspire 20 kingdoms into open revolt. He doesn't necessarily lead them, but he fights along side them, beating the drums of revolution wherever he goes. And, eventually, they win. Sort of. In winning, Joyboy is (likely) defeated, and instead of destroying the ancient kingdom and giving control of the world back to the people, the kingdom is essentially usurped, transforming into the World Government, with a new set of rulers declaring themselves the gods of the Red Line.\n\nAfter this, the WG begins it's plan of totally wiping out the memory of that ancient kingdom and those that inhabited it, out of fear. If people knew that it was possible to overthrow such a powerful and advanced kingdom, to defeat the gods, then what would stop some other plucky band of kingdoms from doing the same to them?\n\n#Chapter 2: Speculation\n\nNow that the basics are lined out, I can jump to some speculation about specifics. Note that a lot of my reasoning here is based of the fact that Oda seems to like reusing certain ideas and themes a lot, so for these next 2 sections, I'm going to assume that a lot of what happened in the void century is being echoed by the story we are currently reading.\n\nFirst, my big point is that Imu was once an outlaw/pirate (I'll assume pirate moving forward), and likely either a rival or friend of Joyboy. Why? Well, I think they were a pirate, because of a super consistent pattern we've seen throughout the series. Namely, of a pirate or outlaw coming in, and attempting (or succeeding) at stealing the legitimate throne of power from the otherwise good rulers. And usually, when this happens, there is some sort of \"official\" endorsement by the government as well. Arlong was working with corrupt marines. Crocodile was a warlord. So was Doflamingo. And while Kaido wasn't, Orochi very much was. And think back to Enel, a ruffian who usurped the throne of god. \n\nThis all relies on an assumption that Imu was made immortal by the Ope Ope no Mi's perpetual youth surgery. I think that's probably a safer bet than some other things I'm going to speculate about. I don't think that surgery plot point was set up as something to be used in the future - I don't think there are any characters who would accept the surgery who the audience would want to see become immortal in that way (that is, perpetual youth, rather than true \"cannot be killed\" immortality). I think instead, it will be used to explain Imu being from the void century. It also helps to explain why the Gorosei are so quick to bow to Imu - they are literally the founder of the current WG.\n\nBasically, I think Imu was in a role similar to Blackbeard or possibly Kid during the void century. A rival pirate, ravaging the world while Joyboy sought to unite it. Eventually, something happened that turned the two rivals into unlikely allies, but when the Lunarians were defeated, they quickly turned on Joyboy and ended up in charge of the world government. The WG keeps them a secret because they aren't truly immortal - if someone were to attack them, they could die, leaving the WG without it's true leader for the first time in 800 years. \n\nSecond, I think it's possible that the Lunarians invented Devil Fruits, and that's what kicked off the whole void century thing. Vegapunk talks about the devil fruits each representing a sort of eventual evolutionary state of mankind. Maybe the Lunarians were experimenting on people, giving various powers to their trusted minions, the way the Marines and Blackbeard do. Eventually, these found their way into the hands of various pirates and revolutionaries, giving the people enough power to fight back against the Lunarians.\n\n#Chapter 3: What Might Happen\n\nOkay, so, if all of this is true, I think we're currently witnessing a sort of re-play of the void century, with the WG as the Lunarians, Blackbeard (probably) as Imu, and Luffy as Joyboy. Luffy has already made allies of a bunch of kingdoms that would likely come to his aid in case a full-scale war broke out. (Sakura, Alabasta, Fishman Island, Dressrosa, Zhou, Wano and Amazon Lily for sure, with  Skypiea, Water 7, Kamabakka Kingdom, being likely.) I think all of these people and kingdoms are going to show up at whatever final war with the WG happens (probably a Marineford 2.0 type situation, with Luffy in the place of WB), along with the Strawhat Grand Fleet, and probably the Cross Guild and BB's fleet.\n\nWhich brings me to my final bit of (half-joking) speculation. If Imu is from the void century, and has a true parallel in this time period, it might not be Blackbeard. It could be that there was a Blackbeard, a Xebec type during the void century, who did seek to conquer the world, but they were defeated by Joyboy, possibly in a battle that destroyed them both. In that case, Imu would have been more of an opportunist, someone in the right place at the right time to gain unfathomable power. Someone who was seen as an ally of several major players, who is terribly afraid of future revolution because they themselves aren't all that powerful. Of course, we're talking about the greatest menace on the Grand Line - Buggy.",

He was also seen walking from the same direction as S-snake, but did not get petrified like York and Lilith. \n\nHint#2\n\nHe claimed to be confused and his eyes lying to him when questioned about the attack, but at the same time was telling Lilith the Seraphims were not listening to their orders.

        "text": "Going back to the previous chapters I noticed there wasn't really a solid timeline of when the navy was moving or when they met Saturn and his ship plus Kizaru said something along the lines of sticking to the plans they already had. So I believe that Saturn is already on the island and is responsible for taking out the cameras.\n\nWhy would he take out the cameras? The power of the Gorsei is still up in the air and seeing a lightning fast old man would let the cat out of the bag. But how is he moving around so silently, it's like there's a fruit for that, Rosinante's fruit. The Nagi Nagi no Mi.\n\nIt can explain a lot really, like why the seraphim aren't taking orders from Vegapunks anymore, it's either a Gorosei's orders OR they just can't hear the orders to begin with. None of the seraphim have really responded to any communication the last few chapters.\n\nAlso the last chapter had someone following Shaka down the stairs without him noticing, only being revealed when Stella saw him approaching.\n\nThen the jig was up, the soundproof came off, he shot Shaka in the head and you can finally hear him walking down the stairs with his cane (that he's always shown with) and making a racket the rest of the way down.\n\nThe KTOK sound reminded me of walking with crutches and it sparked this idea.",

        "text": "Consider these facts:\n\n1. Teach is said to have a unique body according to Marco during Marineford.\n\nAfter Teach appeared with Whitebeard‚Äôs ability, the entire war was in shock with the only canonical clue being Marco‚Äôs reference to his unique structure.\n\n2. Big Mom has a member of all but 3 species on her island. \n\nIf we appropriately assume she was talking about Giants in this conversation and cross-reference her attitude toward King in Onigashima, it‚Äôs fair to conclude the two races she is missing on her island are Lunarians and Giants.\n\n3. Jewelry Bonney and Bartholomew Kuma but come from a ‚Äúspecial‚Äù race.\n\nAssuming Bonney is a blood relative of his, this makes both Kuma and Bonney a high-value specimen to have. \n\n4. Teach was willing to take Bonney along his crew if she‚Äôd submit to him.\n\nHe‚Äôd also trade her for a warship, so he clearly knows something is special about her that the marines would consider negotiation. Further, since the marines sent Akainu after her, it can be implied they are aware of her value and unwilling to risk losing her to a bad deal. Since Akainu didn‚Äôt chase Teach and was content retrieving Bonney, it can be further reasoned that they did not appear to capture Teach.\n\nOn the flip side, it‚Äôs possible Teach was aware of her potential as well, thus is the reason he‚Äôd be willing to give up his warship had she submitted.\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\n\nSo, where am I going with this? Back to the title of this post: Teach shares the same race as Kuma and Bonney. \n\nNow to connect the dots:\n\nTeach has a unique body because he comes from the same special race that Kuma does, a race unaffiliated with Big Mom‚Äôs island, and was willing to take on Bonney as his bride because she is the only known female member of his race he could get his hands on.\n\nWhat does this mean? Technically it means nothing. But what it could mean is Kuma, Teach, and Bonney all have special abilities exclusive to their race that may include the ability to utilize multiple devil fruit abilities. Considering Kuma was used as a basis for the Pacifista due solely to his unique structure, it can be theorized that his capture served as the catalyst to the creation of green blood and devil fruit weapons in the government. \n\nPerhaps by this innate ability, Teach has also had the ability to utilize the abilities of two different fruit.",

        "text": "OK. So, the first assumption is tha there are no misdirects. The clues are all in the text, like with Kanjuro. And there is a traitor. Not a spy, not someone else, not a mystery seraphim, or a geriatic ninja, or diabolus ex machine.  One of these seven Vegapunks is the traitor....and it's Atlas. This is written presenting the theory as fact for ease of writing. It remains a theory, which remains an opinion. \n\nI mean, sorry, it's Atlas by simple elimination at this point. That said, let's dive into it a little more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The traitor is a vegapunk.   \n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/vr6j1ne9vbna1.png?width=452&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f745df11156c2ac1ce7c322e30ea646db2b596f9)\n\nThis is indisputable and is fatal to all the theories about S-Flamingo or whatever. They cannot override the orders, but lower and upper members of the rung can. This is what we are **shown (not simply told as that would introduce margin for error)** through the world's most high stakes game of capture the flag in the earlier part of the arc. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/33bl9j4nvbna1.png?width=562&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f38210240b9e30a6b9e76150a7ec7be1aaad9e5a\n\n2 - The traitor's plot-line should progress through both the traitor side, and the main-side\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sbi43tpwvbna1.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=afb8950562c071188976e03cea4e76c4f6beb41d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/omn4ak7yvbna1.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5d904fd1147476536944e62a27600c6b1fb5ae38\n\nHere we see Atlas indicate some the ability to remodel themselves. The earlier panel situates Atlas as seeing itself as the ultimate arbiter of violence on Egghead. The Seraphim, for their part, are going wild under the control of Atlas, committing violence.  \n\n# Circumstantial\n\nAs one would notice, all the Vegapunks gave been attacked on Egghead ...which would rule them all out. Except, Atlas is the only Punk not attacked by a Seraphim, at all. All the other five have even attacked in this current sortie, ruling them out. \n\n# Mythological \n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas\\_(mythology)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_(mythology)) Atlas is frequently depicted as an antagonistic figure in Greek Mythology. Going off Wikipedia, Atlas stands against the Olympians, and also is poisoned against Perseus and Heracles, other Greek heroes. Did Oda pick the name Atlas for that  reason? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Motives\n\nCurrently unknown. Holding through for all Vegapunks, the actions would seem to the contradictory to the ultimate self protection incentive all intelligent beings possess. However, a Buster Call Pro Max Ultra could satisfy the robot's thirst for violence. It is also unknown how any Vegapunk would be able to avoid their memories being caught up, with Punk Records being placed as a candidate. Yet, Shaka does not raise that concern, indicating that is should be possible. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8tuleyllxbna1.png?width=709&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=07da5314bb2f771b6cebc061996f921e46af234b\n\nTL:DR, Atlas is the evil Vegapunk, and they've incurred the ultimate art of Violence in their island like some sort of rogue, single-minded AI optimized towards one particular goal for as yet fully unknown motives and hidden its motivation through yet unknown means.",

For those not born in the 80's and 90's Rush was a popular Rock band with a heavy focus on more fantastical and sometimes fictional lyrics. Three dudes who played the hell out of their instruments and put out hits over multiple decades. But I digress...\n\nI found myself thinking about One Piece during this binge. And by the end, Closer to the Heart was blasting and I envisioned the Strawhats sailing into Laugh Tale and almost started crying. Suddenly I realized that a tribute to One Piece should be done using Classic Rocks jams. But Rush can't be the only band from that generation of rock whose music and lyrics would invoke the emotion intended by the story. \n\nFor those old enough to know Classic Rock (specifically 60's-80's) or the cultured among our younger brethren, what songs or bands do you think would make a good tribute movie, the songs that would go with scene from anime. I imagine Fly By Night by Rush would be a good one to end Marineford on, thoughts?",
