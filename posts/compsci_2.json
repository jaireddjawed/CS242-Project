        "text": "Often time while learning to program people can choose any language to write their program which would most likely be a one time task. While writing a library or a program with a huge code base it often becomes difficult to understand it and understand the control flow of how everything works. For me I often find it difficult to understand source code written in object oriented paradigm than in other procedural languages. Beside that some languages are verbose with too much functionality added over time, languages like C and Go has minimal syntax compared to C++ or Java. Whats your opinion on how the choice of language and paradigm affect it's readability and maintainability ?",

Making access and governance fairly and widely shared\n3. Continuously learning and adapting by deploying less powerful models to minimize “one shot to get it right” scenarios\n\nThey consider both the long- and short-term and state strategies for both. The post also outlines their approach for a transition phase once they get close to AGI.\n\n**In the short term they:**\n\n* Aim to create successively more powerful systems\n* Want to give people and institutions time to adapt to the progress while the stakes are low\n* Want to enable a tight feedback loop to tackle questions of bias, job displacement, etc.\n* Plan to continue open-sourcing models to decentralize access and broaden the set of people that contributes\n* Will become increasingly cautious with the creation and deployment of models when they get closer to AGI\n\n**Once they get close to AGI they:**\n\n* Expect the balance between the upsides and downsides of new deployments to shift\n* Are actively working on better alignment techniques\n* Expect that developments in AI safety and capabilities go hand in hand but want to increase the ratio of safety progress to capability progress\n* Have already set up their organization in a way that limits the returns to shareholders so they are not incentivized to capture profits without regard for risk. They can sponsor comprehensive UBI experiments or even cancel obligations to shareholders if safety considerations require it.\n\n**In the long term they:**\n\n* Transition to AGI is perhaps the most important, hopeful, and scary project in human history\n* Expect changes to remain relatively slow for a while and accelerate in the late stages of development\n* Consider AI that can advance science as a special case that could be more impactful than everything else\n* Global coordination to slow down AI efforts will likely become important\n\nThank you for reading!

I will describe two examples, each with a made-up question, below.\n\n\n&gt;Check that all n elements of a number array A are non-negative.\n\nThis is an AND condition.\n\nAn efficient algorithm goes like this:\n\n- Assume that all n elements in A are non-negative.\n\n- Look for a negative value in A.\n\n- If there is a negative value in A, terminate at that element and return false, otherwise, return true.\n\nSample outputs:\n\n- {0, 0.5, 7, 100} outputs true.\n\n- {-13, 0.5, 1.3} outputs false.\n\n- {1, 2, 3} outputs true.\n\nWhat if A is empty (meaning n is 0) though? **It is a case where all and none are synonymous.** According to our algorithm's first step, and the redundancy of subsequent steps, however, it will always output true. Is this necessarily correct? There are multiple relatively strong arguments in favor of this:\n\n- All of A's elements (all 0 of them, a paradoxical phrase) are non-negative.\n\n- If there was one negative number, it would output false, but A's length of 0 elements prevents that.\n\n- If we assume a 1 in x chance of any given element in A being non-negative, then the chance of all n elements being non-negative is 1 in xⁿ. In this case, it would be 1 in x⁰, or just 1 in 1, which is guaranteed.\n\n\n\nOR condition example\n\n&gt;Check that any element of an integer array A is 1.\n\nOnce again, an efficient algorithm goes like this:\n\n- Assume that no element in A is 1.\n\n- Check that A contains 1 at all.\n\n- If A contains 1, terminate at that element and return true, otherwise, return false.\n\nSample outputs:\n\n- {0, 1, 2, 3} outputs true.\n\n- {-1, 2, 3} outputs false.\n\n- {1, 1, 1} outputs true.\n\nFor an empty array, our algorithm returns false, and again, this makes sense, for kind of the opposite reasons (using Augustus De Morgan's logic rules):\n\n- None of A's elements (all 0 of them, a paradoxical phrase) are 1.\n\n- If there was one negative number, it would output true, but A's length of 0 elements prevents that.\n\n- If we assume a 1 in x chance of any given element in A *not* being 1, then the chance of all n elements not being 1 is 1 in xⁿ. In this case, it would be 1 in x⁰, or just 1 in 1, which is guaranteed.\n\n\n(Sorry if this is the incorrect sub.)",

Learn how to train better ML models by improving the data.\n\n[Course homepage](https://dcai.csail.mit.edu/) | [Lecture videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayzOzZGHZy4&amp;list=PLnSYPjg2dHQKdig0vVbN-ZnEU0yNJ1mo5) | [Lab Assignments](https://github.com/dcai-course/dcai-lab)\n\nThe course covers:\n\n- [Data-Centric AI vs. Model-Centric AI](https://dcai.csail.mit.edu/lectures/data-centric-model-centric/)\n- [Label Errors](https://dcai.csail.mit.edu/lectures/label-errors/)\n- [Dataset Creation and Curation](https://dcai.csail.mit.edu/lectures/dataset-creation-curation/)\n- [Data-centric Evaluation of ML Models](https://dcai.csail.mit.edu/lectures/data-centric-evaluation/)\n- [Class Imbalance, Outliers, and Distribution Shift](https://dcai.csail.mit.edu/lectures/imbalance-outliers-shift/)\n- [Growing or Compressing Datasets](https://dcai.csail.mit.edu/lectures/growing-compressing-datasets/)\n- [Interpretability in Data-Centric ML](https://dcai.csail.mit.edu/lectures/interpretable-features/)\n- [Encoding Human Priors: Data Augmentation and Prompt Engineering](https://dcai.csail.mit.edu/lectures/human-priors/)\n- [Data Privacy and Security](https://dcai.csail.mit.edu/lectures/data-privacy-security/)\n\nMIT, like most universities, has many courses on machine learning (6.036, 6.867, and many others). Those classes teach techniques to produce effective models for a given dataset, and the classes focus heavily on the mathematical details of models rather than practical applications. However, in real-world applications of ML, the dataset is not fixed, and focusing on improving the data often gives better results than improving the model. We’ve personally seen this time and time again in our applied ML work as well as our research.\n\nData-Centric AI (DCAI) is an emerging science that studies techniques to improve datasets in a systematic/algorithmic way — given that this topic wasn’t covered in the standard curriculum, we (a group of PhD candidates and grads) thought that we should put together a new class! We taught this intensive 2-week course in January over MIT’s IAP term, and we’ve just published all the course material, including lecture videos, lecture notes, hands-on lab assignments, and lab solutions, in hopes that people outside the MIT community would find these resources useful.\n\nWe’d be happy to answer any questions related to the class or DCAI in general, and we’d love to hear any feedback on how we can improve the course material. Introduction to Data-Centric AI is open-source opencourseware, so feel free to make improvements directly: [https://github.com/dcai-course/dcai-course](https://github.com/dcai-course/dcai-course).",

While I do not have a strong preference for pure markdown writing, I would like a tool that is both versatile and easy to use.\n\nIf you have any suggestions or recommendations, I would greatly appreciate your input.
