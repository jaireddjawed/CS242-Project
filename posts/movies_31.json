The story makes a grand arc with clever plot twists and a satisfying classic finish, back at the start never to be the same.

How come, a high-security government laboratory?!\n\n\nMy biggest issue with the film is the bond with the creature, the way it's developed not working. I mean the first contant between Eliza and the creature. So just Eliza saw the creature and fell in love with? I feel the as ab audience we were fooled this way. Like just you see a\n\n What the creature had to offer. The first encounter was silly and the whole way it's developed is more silly.\n\n\nIn such movies like King Kong 2004, we spent time with the heroine, learning about the creatute, and how we sympthaize with it, they way it makes us root for it, made us want him to be saved and not killed, but this film the way totally the opposite, Like the creature not represented in a way that should we sympathize with it. Or even if is killed? Does it matter for us as audience? We never sympahties with it. \n\n\nAlso the characters lack motives and psychological side, the best example is the main villain Strickland, basicallly all what they shows is the exaggrated random  violence that villain can do without back story or just dives deep into his characters\n\nI'm disappointed with this film, It's nothing compared to the masterpiece Pan's labryinth or  pinocchio 2022, Let me know your thought, guys",

Early reactions for Scream 6 are VERY positive though. Like overwhelmingly positive. So now I'm conflicted 😂\n\nI'm leaning slightly towards 65 because Scream 6 looks kinda formulaic, although it also looks elevated with bigger, next level thrills.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

Everything Everywhere All at Once \n3. Elvis\n4. All Quiet on the Western Front\n5. The Fabelmans\n6. The Banshees of Inisherin\n7. Women Talking\n8. Avatar: The Way of Water\n9. Tár\n10. Triangle of Sadness \n\nNow I know Top Gun isn’t going to win, but it was just my favorite movie that came out this past year. I’m pretty sure EEAAO is going to take the big prize. I’d love to know everyone else’s rankings or opinions on the movies they picked this year.",

Paul Schrader it will never happen and the rest was history.

What I love most about his character is the fact that he's a different type of movie idiot: one who's not full out stupid like the titular characters from Dumb &amp; Dumber or Peter Griffin, but someone who's so pretentious, impulsive, and insecure yet so full of himself that he cant help but make an ass of himself in every scene. It's almost like seeing Dennis, Mac, and Charlie from It's Always Sunny rolled up into one person. \n\nIn a movie that has great performances from other players like Michael Palin, John Cleese, and Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Kline shines out because he's truly giving it all and putting in his 100%, whether it's with the different accents or expressions or physicality. Truly hilarious and I gladly want to rewatch the movie just because of his performance.",

Wouldn't they have more fun going on holidays and targeting childfree couples instead? And why go through any trouble to teach the kid anything (like dancing) if he was going to discard of the kid later on anyway? To have somebody to boss around?\n\nI mean.. I just think there could be more to the villain in this story. What do you think? Was there a motive there, some detail that I missed?",

        "text": "Every movie indulges in some common tropes, but Eric ones always make you roll your eyes? **What are your biggest movie pet peeves**?\n\nMine is when someone gets in a random parked car and - *what do you know* - **the keys are in the visor**. \n\nNo one in real life ever leaves their car keys in the visor! Heck, no one leaves their keys anywhere in the car^.\n\nYet it seems in every movie where someone needs to take a random car, they dig around, open the visor, and voila!\n\n^I imagine this was more common at some idyllic time in history, but certainly hasn't been a common practice for at least a few decades.\n\nWhat's yours?",

I can  understand the influence of gangs but as far as the movie, it’s pretty unimpressive, which sucks because it has potential to be a great film. 1. I don’t understand how someone can introduce a bunch of unique gangs and not explode in none of them. 2. The plot of the movie is to simple. Overall, I think the film needs a remake because it still can be a great movie",

However, I randomly decided to explore a social experiment with myself and decide my personal top 5 movies of all time. It’s actually quite a difficult task when there’s thousands of great films to choose from but I thought I’d ask for other peoples opinions. Drama, comedy, biographical, action, thriller, horror, science fiction, western, (spaghetti) western, fantasy, crime, documentary, music.. whatever it is. I would like to gather the minds of what an average reddit user on this sub, thinks are the greatest movies of all time (or more importantly, great for the time the movie was released). Now my top 2 are as follows:\n\n#1 Goodfellas ( might be an obvious choice but the entire movie is complete brilliance)\n#2 Boyz n the Hood (Filmed in ‘91, it’s a film directed by a very young black man who made a movie based on his own experience in the hood of a broken down south central neighborhood. There was no BS in this film)\n\nNow I want others opinions",

Those will always be there. I'd go after top tier directors. Dennis Villeneuve, Christopher Nolan, David Fincher, Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, Greta Gerwig, Noah Baumbach, Adam McKay, Quentin Tarantino, Paul Thomas Anderson, Richard Linklater, the Safdie Brothers, etc. (I know that's an eclectic list, and I refuse to apologize for it 🤣) Do the good stuff.
