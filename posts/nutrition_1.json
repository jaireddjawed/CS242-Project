(And I'm not talking a wild amount here, I just mean more than the maybe five accidental grams I might consume otherwise...)  \nBut I've noticed that, since upping my protein, I've also had a notable decrease in appetite. Is this likely to be just a coincidence based on other factors, or is there an established link between protein intake and appetite decrease?  \nToday I had a simple protein bar in the morning, and hours later I had no appetite still.

        "text": "Hello! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease remove this if it's deemed too silly. ChatGPT can provide some really useful insights about nutrition, and also some really silly ones, as shown here. \n\nOn a serious note. I want to say that ChatGPT can prove to be REALLY useful when it comes to questions regarding nutrition. For example, asking it to making summaries out of long and seemingly pretty uninteresting books on nutrition. \n\nIn this case, I know that Michael Pollan's book \"The Omnivore's Dilemma\" is somewhat of a bible here. I just thought it'd be funny not to let him contribute in the discussion. Sorry Michael.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n//Joe\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \nTranscript:  \n\n\nMy question:   \nWhat is cannibalism according to Michael Pollan. Also add a debate on the topic starring: An intellectual zombie expert and a voodoo shaman. Michael Pollan is also present but the only thing he is allowed to say is \"I like turtles.\" 600 words.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChatGPT's Answer:\n\nAccording to Michael Pollan, cannibalism is the act of one human consuming the flesh of another human. In his book \"The Omnivore's Dilemma,\" he explores the concept of cannibalism in various cultures throughout history, noting that it has been practiced for reasons such as survival in extreme circumstances, cultural traditions, and religious rituals.\n\nNow, let's imagine a debate on cannibalism between an intellectual zombie expert and a voodoo shaman, with Michael Pollan also present but only allowed to say \"I like turtles.\"\n\nZombie Expert: In the zombie apocalypse, cannibalism is necessary for survival. Zombies eat human flesh, so if humans were to become zombies, they would crave it too.\n\nVoodoo Shaman: In my culture, consuming the flesh of another human being goes against the natural order of life and death. It is considered a sacrilegious act that has spiritual repercussions.\n\nMichael Pollan: I like turtles.\n\nZombie Expert: You're not taking this seriously, Pollan! In the zombie apocalypse, we will have no other option but to eat human flesh to survive.\n\nVoodoo Shaman: That may be true in a hypothetical scenario, but in reality, there are always other options for survival. We should focus on creating sustainable and ethical systems for food production and distribution.\n\nMichael Pollan: I like turtles.\n\nZombie Expert: It's not about ethics, it's about survival. In the zombie apocalypse, there won't be any food or resources left. Cannibalism is the only way to stay alive.\n\nVoodoo Shaman: That is a short-sighted view. Consuming human flesh goes against the natural order and can have serious spiritual consequences.\n\nMichael Pollan: I like turtles.\n\nZombie Expert: You're not contributing anything useful to this conversation, Pollan! In a survival situation, ethics and cultural traditions don't matter. It's about doing whatever it takes to stay alive.\n\nVoodoo Shaman: But the consequences of cannibalism go beyond just the physical act itself. It can lead to psychological trauma and societal breakdown.\n\nMichael Pollan: I like turtles.\n\nAs this debate shows, the topic of cannibalism raises important ethical, cultural, and practical questions. While the zombie expert argues that cannibalism is necessary for survival in extreme circumstances, the voodoo shaman highlights the spiritual consequences of such an act. Michael Pollan's repeated statement of \"I like turtles\" suggests that he may not have a strong opinion on the matter or that he may be trying to defuse the tension in the room.\n\nIn conclusion, while cannibalism may be viewed as necessary for survival in extreme circumstances, it is important to consider the ethical, cultural, and spiritual consequences of such an act. Creating sustainable and ethical systems for food production and distribution can help to prevent such extreme scenarios from occurring. And Michael Pollan? Well, he seems to really like turtles.",

        "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nLooking for help picking pre work out, during workout and post workout supplements.  Workouts will be focused on lifting and plyo for the purpose of losing some weight and gaining muscle.  But mostly losing weight haha.  Kids stopped me from working out for a long time but going to get back into it.  Trying to keep it pretty natural.  Not looking for anything crazy.  Price doesnt matter since the range is pretty small. \n\nAppreciate any help i can get with this",
