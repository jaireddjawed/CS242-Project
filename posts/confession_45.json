I would grab a new trash bag and put it all in that and grab all the other garbage bags and take them out at the same time. Garbage would go in the dumpster but I would hang the bag of food on the fence hanging over the back side. When I finished my shift I would go around the backside of the building and grab it and ride my bike home. I couldn't afford much food and I didn't want to be on any kind of welfare because I'm able bodied, it was my workaround but years later I still feel guilty about it.",

        "text": "I don't particularly know where this post goes, but I want it somewhere for more of a realization to myself and a starting point of fixing myself. I don't particularly understand why things bother people. And I don't understand why the insignificant things I say suddenly are significant. I've always made passive aggressive comments, even if the situation didn't warrant it. Things like, my boyfriend will complain that his earbuds are lacking sound, and I retorted \"Well if you cleaned your ears once in a blue moon they wouldn't be that bad'. At work people will complain about working, and the responses usually fall along the line \"It's not that hard\" \"\"Well leave me alone about it\" \"Get the fuck over it.\"\n\nI say get over it a lot to things that I think should matter little. People in fact do not like the statement. Why I don't know. If I'm ever upset in a situation, I am told to get over it, and I do. I take a shower, put on some make-up, and do something that gives me joy. I don't understand why people don't have the same mentality. \n\nNone of this constitutes as an awareness of my title, or that I in fact feel bad for my actions. It's starting to affect my relationships. I don't care about people, I never really have, however, I do care about some. And my boyfriend is a major one. He was my best friend for months and we recently got together. We've always hung around each other a lot, but it's recently been 24/7. My comments aggravate him, and I can see it affecting him overall. When I'm ever upset, he pushes me to talk about it, to which the response is always, \"I'm fine, I'll get over it\". And I am fine and I will get over it, because little things doesn't matter. I will talk to him about it, just not in that moment. However it sparks more aggression. \n\nIt's not only him. I've been getting my hours cut at work because I \"create a toxic work environment to those around me\". I don't particularly see it but I've apparently had multiple complaints over me. People complain and I don't understand why, get over it. People are lazy and don't work, I tell them so. People push their 'help' onto me when I'm clearly faster alone. \n\nI don't hold the door open for people. I don't say thank you, I say I appreciate you, but apparently I have a deadpan tone when I say it. I don't apologize unless I feel bad, which is not typical. I don't say happy birthday nor celebrate anyone's birthday including my own. I don't smile at people unless I'm happy to be with you. If you're stupid, I'll tell you. If you're doing something wrong, be prepared to be told. I shut people down on stories I don't care about. I have reasons for all of these behaviors but apparently that's just an excuse when I mention it. \n\nI don't know. I don't feel remorse for my actions, but I feel bad that people are being affected by it and I want to fix it. I want relationships, and I want people to smile when they know they get to be with me. I just don't know how to get there. The post is long but it's more for me than you. Thank you for reading.",

        "text": "We’re both 23. He’s expressed A LOT of interested in me, some romantic, but mostly sexual. I think that he thinks he likes me a lot, but only because he is so attracted to me. He hasn’t really made an effort to genuinely get to know me. Feels like I’m a girl to be had, an object of desire, not a person. He’s cute and funny, so I entertain it. I’m not completely put off by this, but it can be annoying sometimes. We talk daily, small talk and silly conversations, and have started sexting a lot lately. He asked me when the last time I had sex was. It was 7 months ago. I asked him, he said one week ago. He’s single, I’m single, it’s not a big deal…but it definitely caught me off guard hahahah\n\nThen he asked me my body count (who even asks this anymore?🤣)\nI think body counts are unimportant. As long as you’re having safe and consensual sex, who cares how many people you’ve slept with? Anyways, I know that plenty of men believe that a woman’s body count speaks to her value as a person.\nLow body count = pure, innocent, can belong to me\nHigh body count = shameful for her to belong to me because she’s belonged to others before me, which is a threat to my masculinity\nI asked him to tell me his first and it was in the sixties or something like that. My body count is only 11, but I knew I was about to fucking obliterate his world when I told him. Lmaoooooooooo\nHe was so sad and disappointed over it. He said that he never thought of me that way and thought I was so innocent. Man shut the hell up! 🤣🤣🤣🤣",

        "text": "Children's Special Life Related Stories And Facts\n\nHow A Person Deal With Chronic Issue|| Story Of A Man\n\nposted by Children's Creative Stories on January 18, 2023\n\n What is chronic illness story\n\n\n\nThis might be a long story, so in advance, I’m sorry.\n\nFrom the age of 7 I suffered with what was diagnosed as acid reflux, despite it not fitting the symptoms or description. I was prescribed medications that gave me more side effects than it did help. Resorted to going to a second doctor who gave me a prescription for gaviscon as well.\n\nWhen I was 9 the chronic pain began. It started in my back, but my mum assumed it was just growing pains and ignored it. Then it spread to my hips, so she took me to the doctor. Doctor told me it was just growing pains… Doctor was wrong. My kidneys were failing requiring dialysis. It took years before they found out why, they didn’t give me a firm diagnosis for another 8 years. Today I’m on the transplant list for a new kidney, however I haven’t yet found a donor.\n\nWhen i was 11 the shortness of breath began. The doctor didn’t even see me, just looked at my age and had me describe over the phone how frequently it happened. He diagnosed me as asthmatic. He was wrong. About a month after he gave me the diagnosis, and the medication having done nothing, the SOB got worse. It would happen whatever i was doing, completely random. The chest pains started not long after, along with tachycardia and dizziness. Once the chest pains got so severe that I couldn’t move, bear in mind I was 10 and my pain threshold has always been incredibly high, I went to the A&amp;E. When I got there they told me that I was wrong, my chest pains didn’t exist and I was too young to have any problem with my heart or lungs. They treated me as if I suffered from munchausens, and when we denied that, suggested munchausens by proxy. So now, not only are they accusing a ten year old child of lying about chest pains for attention, they’re accusing her mother of abuse. For the record, my mother is a lovely woman, we may not always get on but I love her, and she would never hurt me. They tried to send me home, got as far as the car park (halfway to the car) before I collapsed. My heart had stopped beating. They immediately retracted their statements and had me admitted to hospital after resuscitating (if that’s the right word) me. Never have I seen A&amp;E staff so apologetic.\n\nI recovered from that, no surgery, and was sent home. They again weren’t sure why it had happened, but sent me for further tests, some showed abnormal results however there still was no clear cause shown. By the time I was 13 I had asked for an ANA blood test many times, each time being refused. I should mention, there is a family history of seronegative arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, ehlers danlos and sarcoidosis, so we weren’t short of medical knowledge.\n\nI switched GP when I was 15 to someone who listened to me, I still see him now. He’s one of the only doctors who has always taken into account what I’ve said, and accepts that I know my body. He was the only one who pushed everyone to help me get a diagnosis. He did the blood tests, unsurprisingly the ANA came back positive.\n\nIt took until I was 17 for a diagnosis of lupus (SLE) with multiple system involvement. My body had been so damaged from it there was no way to recover properly. I have been given the treatment now, however many years too late. If I had been treated earlier, my GP has told me many times now, it may not have been terminal.\n\nMy story may be depressing, but it’s all too true for many people with chronic illnesses. I have lupus, POTS, fibromyalgia and bone cancer, and yes, it’s gonna kill me.",
