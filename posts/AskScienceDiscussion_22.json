I assume this growth is the result of various cell-to-cell interactions and intercellular signaling pathways (example of response to stimuli). These cellular processes occur because the embryo consumed nutrients for energy (example of metabolism). These cellular processes are also facilitated by the regulation of various intercellular chemicals (example of homeostasis). So, it seems that if merely cellular growth is present, then all these other criteria for life must also be present all well, so they actually overlap.\n\nIs this correct?

        "text": "So, my foundational understanding: The expansion of space has an associated value of energy required to be introduced to create that expansion, the lack of known source and/or any other properties is what earns it the name Dark Energy. And it's calculated to make up a *lot* of the universe's 'stuff' by huge percentages. This introduction of energy is only possible because the universe as a whole is not a closed system. \n\nCould it be possible to harness this to be effectively a force that could be translated into heat/energy some how? \n\nThe simplest form of an idea I can think of is a large 3-d mesh of a strong piezoelectric materials that would experience stress from the expansion of space pushing out from the large expanses between the filaments. The expanded space itself would of course push/expand beyond the mesh, but this is a continuous process so there would always be more space expanding, creating an even strain on the mesh. \n\nTo be clear, I'm assuming this mesh would be in interstellar space, if not intergalactic, because the gaps would probably have to be mind bogglingly huge to potentially feel the necessary strain to generate any sort of energy.\n\nIt also occurs to me that if any way of tapping into dark energy to generate any sort of normal energy could possibly happen, it would locally reduce how much expansion there was by the amount of energy converted to heat or other energy. \n\nAnd even if this energy was not directly harvestable (Gets dumped as heat/IR photons before it can collect to a useable electrical charge), the additive effects of this might be considered worthwhile for a very advanced species to invest time and resources into, as staving off the heat death of the universe would generally be considered a good thing. Would such a super-mesh structure be detectable from afar?\n\nare there any more plausible scenarios for harvest Dark Energy some how? it's an active if diffuse energy source that is *doing* something, if work of some sort is happening it seems that there should be some way of diverting some portion of that work into creating a more useful form of that energy.

Will humans continue to evolve on other planets?\n2. Could this result in new subspecies of humans?\n3. Could the local environmental cause these new subspecies to be unable to return to Earth?\n4.

Note that this is just me trying to explain things and I am not at all an expert.\nSo I thought that gravity works all the time, between any distance.  I asked myself: \"so why do atoms/particles not collide and merge if gravity can works between very far away, or very close objects\". I explained this by the fact that they most probably repel each other with electromagnetic forces, or at least, some kind of nuclear force(which I do not know enough to go deeper into).\n\nSo then, I got this idea. What if you could smash thing together with more energy/greater force than the repelling force. Well, the matter in the particles would come closer, infitiecimally closer. The closer they get, the stronger gravity gets between them, but also, the bigger the ripple in space time they make. This also means, since they crossed this repelling threshold, once they get too close, there is no way to actually get the matter back, since gravity gets stronger, and stronger, too strong, while the matter falls in itself and space time. \n\nI though this would explain why stars have to be of a specific size to create black holes when they die in a supernova. If they are too small, they do not have enough energy/force to press matter past the threshold. Once passed, every other particles that gets too close to the matter that massed the threshold, will also get sucked in, not necessarily by the exploding star, but by the ever growing gravity between the matter that already is inside the singularity\nNow, while this is probably not exactly how it works, I would like to get your point of view, and even, if there is someone capable, an explanation to how black holes come to be, and even some thing about space time and it's \nrelationship to gravity. \n\nThank you very much for your time !",

This may verge into the realm of philosophy, but I think at its core it's a science question.\n\nI recently saw [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO_Q_f1WgQI) which tries to explain how a distant observer might view different time periods on earth, depending on whether they were traveling towards or away from earth. It's a little bit goofy (they use an alien on a bike), but the explanation they give is that an alien 10 billion lightyears away moving towards the earth would perceive what would be our future, and if it was moving away, it would perceive what would be our past. [Here's a link to the beginning of the specific section.](https://youtu.be/MO_Q_f1WgQI?t=4m56s)\n\nA friend who showed me this video is suggesting that because the observer could see the future of earth simply by moving away from earth, the future must be determined. The analogy of time as a \"frozen river\" has come up.\n\nI don't have the scientific expertise to research this on my own, so I was wondering if these ideas are in fact connected.\n",

Scientists with a conflict of interest might use low sample sizes, p-hacking, specific mice breeds, for instance, to show a specific thing. Or they work for a university that demands news-worthy results published constantly, or a corporation that only wants specific results.\n\nWhatever the case, it's common knowledge most results in scientific studies are false. [Here's a thing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1182327) So how does science and scientists overcome biases and stuff?\n\nWhat if we rate scientists based on how often their peer-reviewed papers are shown to be correct? Weighted by degrees of separation, like an Erdos rating, but for everyone, where higher is better. The weighting would be to prevent friends artificially inflating ratings.\n\nSo suppose I have three papers peer-reviewed, one peer-reviewed by someone whose 5 degrees separated from me by scientific studies who finds my paper true, one by someone 2 degrees who finds my paper true, and one by 3 degrees who finds my paper false. I suggest a ratio system of (5+2)/(3)=2.33.\n\nWhat will this accomplish? Well If this rating was wide spread, it would incentivize scientists to make papers that they believe will be backed up by peer-review. They would get called out for making bad studies, and it would be measurable how corrupt they are. So what are the flaws with this?\n\nedit: The reason for creating a ranking system of scientists is ultimately to create a ranking system of papers. Which papers should be believed more than others? I basically want to find a solution to the greatest? problem in p-value science: the [replication crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis).\n\nThis doesn't seem to be a problem in math, physics, astronomy, etc. But is a problem in pharmacology, phycology, medicine, etc.",

However, the leftover is not exactly 0.25, so it can't be cancelled with just one day every four years.\n\nI calculated (maybe my calculations are wrong anyway) and every 276 years we would have 1.003537104 more days even if we discount one entire day every four years as we do.\n\nNow, I haven't heard or read of any more days added to our modern calendar besides February 29.

Any opinions or answers are welcome, thanks for reading.\n\nI discussed this casually with a few peers and young adults and eventually we decided that somewhere temperate, far from civilization and chances of natural disasters would be best. Self sufficiency would be key as we figured most services would break down as things got real bad. Isolation would also be important as somebody totally self sufficient is a tempting target for those who never prepped. \n\nE: To be clear I dont expect walking dead levels of destruction but I personally believe humans arent changing quickly enough to protect ourselves from the major destructive effects of climate change.",
