We just arrived in Houston TX yesterday, and we'll be in Texas for 1 month (for any  musicians/singers of ANY level nearby that want to connect!). This year we will go to 25 countries total.\n\n[Proof 1](https://imgur.com/a/bDvNkco) [Proof 2](https://www.instagram.com/p/CoyK8ZoOgy6/). \n\nWe've been using Reddit (mainly the r/ukulele subreddit) to connect with people in countries we visit, which so far include: Spain, France, Belgium, and now The United States. \n\n**The idea:** I get people to play a single note (or chord) on the ukulele, and then we edit it together to make a music video from each country. [Here's the one we did for Spain](https://www.instagram.com/p/CofEHJCLck2/). The ones for France and Belgium have yet to be edited. \n\nHere's the brief synopsis from the website: Meet Trippy The Traveling Ukulele!\n\nWith the help of its human (Alex), Trippy is attempting to be the FIRST musical instrument in history to play music in every country in the world. Trippy will partner with musicians and artists in every country, while telling stories along the way. You can follow Trippy’s adventures on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/trippythetravelingukulele/), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@trippythetravelingukulele), and [Tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/@travelingukulele). Throughout the project, Alex and Trippy will also help raise money (via corporate sponsors) for the international non-profit [UNICEF](https://www.unicef.org/), which does incredible work in 190 countries. They have the goal of raising $1 million USD for UNICEF over the course of 10 years, starting in 2023. \n\n\\--------------\n\nThis is a 10-year project and it's still SUPER early, but I'm going to make it a habit to check in every 6 months or so. The purpose of the project is simply to bring joy to people via travel + music :)",

We study past global environmental disruptions, their relationship to mass extinctions, nonlinear dynamics (think “tipping points”) and what this all means for the long-term consequences of present-day climate change.\n\nOne particularly interesting thing we’ve found concerns past episodes of carbon cycle change (e.g. CO2-driven warming from volcanoes). Some of these events were associated with mass extinctions --- events in which more than 3/4 of species went extinct --- and some weren’t. It turns out that mass extinctions tend to occur when global environmental change exceeds a critical rate. In other words, it’s not just how *much* CO2 is released, but also how *fast*. The amount of carbon we’ll likely emit by 2100 is similar to what seems to have triggered mass extinctions in the past.\n\nWe’ll be here from around 2-4pm EST (7-9pm GMT). Ask us anything, and we’ll do our best to answer!\n\nProof: [https://imgur.com/a/Cgp56GN](https://imgur.com/a/Cgp56GN)",

        "text": "PROOF: https://i.redd.it/1f3wjeznm8ia1.jpg\n\nIn the aftermath of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High massacre in 2018, we reported for the first time how many children had endured a shooting at a K-12 school since 1999, and the final tally was far higher than what we had expected: more than 187,000.\n \nNow, just five years later, and despite a pandemic that closed many campuses for nearly a year, the number has exploded, climbing past 331,000.\n\nWe know that because we’ve continued to maintain a unique database that tracks the total number of children exposed to gun violence at school, as well as other vital details, including the number of people killed and injured, the age, sex, race and gender of the shooters, the types and sources of their weapons, the demographic makeup of the schools, the presence of armed security guards, the random, targeted or accidental nature of the shootings.\n\nSteven is the database editor for the investigations unit at The Washington Post. John Woodrow Cox is an enterprise reporter and the author of Children Under Fire: An American Crisis.\n\nView the Post's database on children and gun violence here: https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/local/school-shootings-database/?itid=hp-banner-main\n \nRead their full story on what they've learned from this coverage here: https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/02/14/school-shootings-parkland-5th-anniversary/?utm_campaign=wp_main&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=reddit.com",

As far as I've seen I'm the only person teaching solo IFS as a unique skill-set, different from the classic IFS protocol.\n\nOf course I can't provide therapy over Reddit, but I can answer theoretical questions about IFS, practical questions about it, and questions about the process of solo IFS. \n\nThrow your IFS and parts work questions at me!

I felt I couldn’t rush back to an office job and pretend to care about office nonsense. I wanted to be somewhere nourishing and to do something straightforward and useful. So I took a job as a quiet watchman in a great palace of art.\n\nOver the next ten years I spent two thousand days in the Met’s galleries, communing with masterpieces, exploring, people watching, pacing, leaning, thinking my thoughts, responding to incidents, and befriending my diverse and talented colleagues in dark blue suits. \n\nToday — today! — Simon ＆ Schuster is publishing [my book](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/All-the-Beauty-in-the-World/Patrick-Bringley/9781982163303) about the experience, ALL THE BEAUTY IN THE WORLD: THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART AND ME. The Washington Post (paywall) [calls it](https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2023/02/09/metropolitan-museum-memoir-guard-bringley/) “exquisite,” the AP [calls it](https://apnews.com/article/reviews-book-business-entertainment-c735f3de5a1d4c659666eace1ea12801) “hauntingly beautiful,” and the New York Times Book Review [describes it as](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/27/books/review/salesses-kois-bringley.html) “an empathic chronicle of one museum, the works collected there and the people who keep it running — all recounted by an especially patient observer.” It’s available everywhere books are sold, and you’ll find direct links to the usual outlets [here](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/All-the-Beauty-in-the-World/Patrick-Bringley/9781982163303).\n\nIt’s a bit of a moment for me, and I’d be thrilled to answer any questions about the museum, its operations, its guards, its treasures, and the unique role of a (mostly) quiet and (mostly) solitary watchman in this busy world of ours. Also, if you have any questions about writing and publishing a book, I’m happy to field those as well.\n\nOr anything else!\n\nVisit [my site](https://www.patrickbringley.com/) to learn more!
