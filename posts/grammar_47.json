As history it cannot be compared with the Nihongi, a contemporary work in Chinese; while the language is a strange mixture of Chinese and Japanese, which there has been little attempt to endue with artistic quality.”\n\nAs you can see, there’s a semicolon in the second sentence and to my mind it seems like it could be misplaced. My understanding is that semicolons are only supposed to be used when you’re separating two independent clauses (or when you’re writing a list of items and want to avoid using too many commas), only the second clause in the sentence isn’t independent. \n\nI get that the author could just be making a stylistic decision and might just have wanted to suggest a longer pause than a comma would create but every semicolon guide I’ve read indicates that this isn’t technically kosher, unless I’m forgetting something.

If it never existed, we'd be used to hearing them used in this way and there's no other reason that would make it grammatically wrong to do so.\n\nAll of this is just my musings and I'd love to hear further thoughts.
