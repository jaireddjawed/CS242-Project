        "text": "Regarding AI cheating in academia &amp; the human effort it takes to discern AI generated text from written text: a lot of very very smart people are doing lots &amp; lots of good work writing AI-assisted AI detector bots, or Digitally Watermarking AI text, both projects beyond my feeble human ken. I've just kind of wondered because I haven't seen it discussed before, shouldn't the onus of delineating man from machine be on the side providing the AI chatbot? Shouldn't they be providing public record of the raw text generated by their public toy in a database, easily checked &amp; cross-referenced by existing plagiarism tools? \n\nI know it's not beyond any of these companies: for all their sci-fi machinations, language models ultimately return a few KBs of output, &amp; we're talking about the likes of Microsoft, Alphabet, &amp; Meta.\n\nIf security is an issue, sell your clients a secure platform for your chatbot, managed by their organization. AI is already difficult to monetize as it is - it's why Silicon Valley ignored LLMs for the entire 2010's. Ami I missing something in my assessment? This seems like a no brainer solution &amp; these firms should be pressured to adopt it.",

        "text": "I posted this in a comment to another post and thought maybe it deserved its own post so here goes.\n\nI imagine a society where mandatory work hours are no longer a thing needed to stay employed. Also no per job interviews. and bunch of other stuff I'll go over.\n\nPeople will be given a work pass. they can go to school to add certifications to their work pass that'll allow them to work in certain fields. When they need money, they can just go in a business, clock in with their pass and if immediately approved they can start earning cash doing what needs to be done. If they do an excellent job, they'll get merits on their pass that'll allow them to take on better paying jobs (or just better pay for same job). Job burnout will be a thing of the past because when you get bored with one place, you can go to another place to work. or take an extended vacation with no repercussions from missed work. \n\nRegular employment could still be a thing with incentives to remain a regular employee being higher pay than Pass workers. Also since the work pass would be considered contract work, reg employees would be the ones receiving benefits. While pass workers would have to fund their own dental, 401k, whatever.\n\nCONCEPT: Large businesses like Wal-Mart could have 70% employees and leave 30% empty for work pass workers to fill. That ratio could be modified as needed. it's just a concept to show that a hybrid system could work. There's hardly ever more than half the registers being attended to anyway lol.\n\n**work pass workers advantages**\n\n* set your own work days and hours.\n* unlimited time off\n* immediately work anywhere you're qualified\n* No unnecessary interviews. Interviews will still be a thing for acquiring new qualifications, but wont be necessary for each job. If you got the skills, you can start working.\n* no job burnout\n\n**Regular Employee advantages**\n\n* higher pay\n* guaranteed work (as long as you are employed)\n* retirement plan\n* dental\n* elective health (cuz universal healthcare would be a thing hopefully)\n* All the other benefits\n* Businesses that require consistent employment get to exist (tho more expensive for them to keep reg employees)\n\n**Work pass disadvantages**\n\n* no free additional benefits\n* initially low pay (but can work up to reg pay eventually with excellent performances)\n* that eerie feeling you get from being tracked (has to have some record for measuring performances and qualifications)\n* sometimes no one would show up for work. Unemployment is pretty high tho so this might not be an issue... maybe\n* first come first serve; A place you like working at might be already full of work pass workers meaning you have to go somewhere else or wait for someone to clock out.\n\n**Regular employee disadvantages**\n\n* mandatory work schedule\n* taking time off can lead to termination\n* job burnout\n* much harder to get a job\n* socially anxious people find it daunting (especially the interview)\n* overlook transgressions to stay employed (ie bad boss)\n\nNote that these are no way a complete list. it's just what's off the top of a single person's mind in the span of like an hour.",

I am reaching out to the community to ask for any guidance, suggestions, or support on this topic.\n\nHere are some details about our situation:\n\n* We have several Azure resources and services deployed, including virtual machines, storage accounts, and databases, among others.\n* We are using the Azure Cost Management and Billing solution to monitor and manage our costs.\n* We have set up custom budgets and alerts to track our spending and notify us when we exceed certain thresholds.\n* We are using Azure Log Analytics to collect and analyze log data from our resources and services.\n\nDespite these measures, we are still encountering unexpected spikes in our costs, and we are struggling to identify the root causes of these issues. We suspect that some resources might be overprovisioned, underutilized, or misconfigured, but we don't have a clear picture of where to focus our efforts.\n\nI would appreciate any advice on how to set up a pipeline for cost analysis and anomaly detection that would allow us to:\n\n* Monitor our costs on a daily basis, including usage and billing data.\n* Identify anomalies and outliers in our cost patterns, such as sudden increases or decreases.\n* Correlate our cost data with other metrics, such as resource utilization, performance, and availability.\n* Investigate the root causes of our cost issues, such as misconfigured resources, idle or unused capacity, or unexpected spikes in demand.\n* Take corrective actions to optimize our costs and prevent future issues.\n\nI am open to any suggestions regarding free tools, techniques, best practices, or case studies open sources  that could help us tackle this challenge. If you have experience in this area, or if you know someone who does, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.\n\nThank you in advance for your help.\n\nBest regards,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHakim Atrous\n\nData Sciences Intern",

In regards to internal aid, will nanotech be used in conjunction with things such as gene editing? \n\nHow will such targeted gene editing work in conjunction with nanotech when there is to be AI aiding in the detection, suggestion, and application of 'treatments?' Will a smart enough AI be able to propose the corresponding plans with sufficient data gathered from the nanotech (very likely), and how will it affect those who have already reached adulthood.  \n\n\nConditions affecting the growth of one's body can easily be corrected with the help of nanotech whilst still in the growth stage, but what if it is to be used in an adult? Would adjustments for things like scoliosis require very gradual treatment plans on the nanotech's part?\n\nAt the end of the day, will nanotech be able to fix nearly everything wrong with the human body, even if it takes time to do so? \n\nCurious about how nanotech will fare in the face of de-aging technology as well. If de-aging technology is to be taken into account, will nanotech have to correct the genes that resulted in adverse/abnormal growth before it can take place?\n\nFinally, how close are we to using nanotech on a major basis for medicine? I do know that it is already being used, but when do you think it will be widespread and maybe have AI to aid in consultation?",

        "text": "Before i start, i just want to say that we absolutely should get rid of aging and all age related diseases. However, there are some potential issues that need to be addressed.\n\nOverpopulation - The first and most obvious one is overpopulation. There are 8 billion people on this planet, with 10 billion expected by 2050. That’s assuming there is no life extension available by then, which chances are there will be. We are struggling to sustain our current population as it is, so if we, say, increased the average lifespan to 135, that would be an extra 55 year’s worth of resources per person that we would need to come up with. Not only that, those people would have 55 extra years to have children, and those children would have 55 extra years, etc. How is this sustainable? We would have to impose strict limits on how many children we could have, which would probably involve sterilising everyone and having an application process to be temporarily unsterilised to have 1 or 2 children, then being resterilised.\n\nCultural Stagnation - this is basically the idea that without old people dying off and taking their old fashioned ideas with them, and new, young people taking over with new ideas, society would stagnate. And i fail to see how that concept is wrong. Imagine if slave owners from the 1800s were still around today, voting in pro slavery candidates? Once you get to a certain age, your opinions are set and it’s hard to change them. The way i see this one being avoided is if the brain was somehow restored to a young(er) state in order to allow for greater neuroplasticity.  \n\n\nUnequal Access - this is the third issue i see talked about a lot. Some people like to think that everyone will have access to the literal holy grail of modern medicine. Well i’m sorry, but that’s just wishful thinking. Diabetics are dying left and right because something as simple as insulin is so expensive, and people expect the LITERAL CURE FOR AGING to be affordable? Not only that, there have been quite a lot of technologies that didn’t and still are not affordable for the average person, such as high end smartphones, cars, and solar panels. I don’t know how this one can be solved, so please tell me in the comments.",

        "title": "Durability of a Pyramid on the moon ( + fact-checking Chat GPT's response)",
        "author": "DukeOfZork",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/118firl/durability_of_a_pyramid_on_the_moon_factchecking/",
        "text": "Apologies if this is not the appropriate subreddit, I'm wondering how long a pyramid might last on Earth's moon.  Just a bit of a thought experiment about how humans might leave an indelible mark on the universe that could someday be observed by other intelligences.\n\nPerhaps as a starting point for discussion, would anyone care to fact-check this response I got from ChatGPT? Lately I've been curious about how accurately the tool might be able to provide insights about distant future scenarios based on our current understanding of physics.\n\n\\--\n\nQ: If you built a pyramid of Giza on the moon, how weathered would it look after 1 million years?\n\nGPT: Assuming the pyramid on the moon is constructed similarly to the ones on Earth with the same materials and dimensions, it would likely remain very well preserved for an incredibly long time, given the lack of weathering and erosion on the moon's surface.\n\nUnlike Earth, the moon has no atmosphere, no wind, no water, and no living organisms to cause any weathering or erosion. Therefore, any structure on the moon would not be subjected to the same types of wear and tear that affect structures on Earth.\n\nHowever, the moon is exposed to a different type of environmental factor: the constant bombardment of micrometeorites and other space debris. Over a very long period, this could cause some wear and tear on the surface of the pyramid, resulting in small impacts and crate\n\nNonetheless, after a million years, the pyramid would likely still be very recognizable, with most of its structural integrity intact. Any wear and tear would likely be limited to the surface, and the general shape of the pyramid would remain relatively unchanged.\n\n\\--\n\nQ: What about after 10 million years?\n\nGPT: After 10 million years, the pyramid on the moon would likely still be recognizable as a pyramid, but it would likely have undergone more significant changes compared to after just 1 million years.\n\nOver this extended period, the constant bombardment of micrometeorites and space debris would have caused more significant erosion on the surface of the pyramid. There would be more craters and pockmarks, and the edges and corners of the pyramid would likely be more rounded and smoother.\n\nAdditionally, the constant exposure to extreme temperature changes on the moon could cause some expansion and contraction of the materials that make up the pyramid. This could result in some cracks and fractures forming, especially if the materials are not very resistant to thermal stress.\n\nDespite these changes, however, the overall structure of the pyramid would likely still be recognizable as a pyramid, with its general shape and proportions remaining intact. The lack of significant weathering or erosion on the moon's surface means that any changes would likely be limited to the surface of the structure, and the pyramid would likely remain standing for many millions of years to come.\n\n\\--\n\nQ: How long would it remain recognizable as a pyramid constructed by intelligent life?\n\nGPT: Determining how long the pyramid on the moon would remain recognizable as a structure constructed by intelligent life depends on a variety of factors, such as the materials used to construct the pyramid, the rate of erosion caused by micrometeorites and space debris, and the effects of extreme temperature changes on the moon's surface over long periods.\n\nAssuming the pyramid is made of durable materials that are resistant to erosion and thermal stress, it could potentially remain recognizable as a structure constructed by intelligent life for millions or even billions of years.\n\nHowever, over an extended period, other factors could come into play that might obscure the pyramid's origins. For example, the constant bombardment of micrometeorites and space debris could cause a buildup of regolith (loose material) around the pyramid, burying it under a layer of moon dust. This could make the pyramid less visible and less recognizable over time.\n\nAnother factor is the possibility of future geological activity on the moon. While the moon is relatively geologically inactive today, there is evidence of past volcanic activity on the lunar surface. If such activity were to occur again in the future, it could potentially bury the pyramid under layers of volcanic ash, making it even less recognizable as a structure constructed by intelligent life.\n\nOverall, it's challenging to predict exactly how long the pyramid on the moon would remain recognizable as a structure constructed by intelligent life, as it depends on a wide range of factors that are difficult to predict with certainty.",

        "text": "Some people (maybe not on this sub, but on others) like to imagine the idea of the singularity. The idea that one day, there will be an “intelligence explosion” and technology will advance at a blinding speed, bringing about a utopia beyond anyone’s wildest dreams.\n\nthe thing is, that just isn’t going to happen. Wanna know how many experts take the idea of the singularity seriously? 0. And before anyone says “kurzweil / de gray / church believes in it” those are not real experts, 99% of actual experts don’t take them seriously.  Technology doesn’t just keep getting exponentially better and better. It follows s curves, which is basically the observation that a new technology emerges, gains momentum until it has become practical, and then there is incremental progress.  The “law of accelerating returns” is not a real law, not 1 actual scientist, A.I researcher, geneticist, roboticist, etc takes it seriously. if it were a real law, computers would run on 283747484847483929 bit operating systems and have a googl amount of RAM by now. “Exponential growth” won’t help either, like i said, the law of accelerating returns is not a real law, things don’t just keep getting better and better exponentially forever, they follow s curves.\n\nPeople think technology is accelerating, well it isnt. What is the difference between 2003 and 2023, apart from new drugs, higher survival rates, and better computers? and all the technologies we hear about are decades away at best, and thats not even considering that 99% of the “breakthroughs” never go anywhere. We have been hearing about “miracle cancer cures” for decades and yet millions still die of cancer every year. The gene therapies we have now are primitive, can currently only cure genetic conditions caused by 1 maybe 2 errors, and many if not most involve using chemo to wipe out the immune system in order to introduce the cure. this is despite the fact that gene editing has been researched since at least the 60s. ChatGPT and Bing A.I, while impressive, are nowhere near AGI (which is decades away at best, despite what some may have you believe) and will not bring about the singularity. So where exactly is the acceleration?\n\nSome things i have noticed is that the people who actually believe in this crap (singularitarians) like to argue with the experts and try to tell them that they’re wrong. Even when they are given facts, actual facts and not just opinions, they dismiss it and act like the singularity is going to happen. The theme of the singlaritarians counter arguments always seems to be “exponential growth” and “kurzweil says this” even though these are weak at best.\n\nand it’s actually pretty sad when you think about it, people hoping for a sci fi utopia that will never arrive. I have actually seen people say they spend their entire life thinking about “how the singularity is going to change the world” and how “its the only thing stopping them from feeling depressed”. I feel sorry for them. I feel sorry for those who believe in this lie. They are going to be in for a shock when 2045 (or whenever its supposed to happen, 2045 seems to be the consensus) arrives and there is no singularity.",
