I'm at the point where I've truly lost all motivation to do anything. My internship is really demanding and I'm having a hard time setting boundaries because I do genuinely enjoy the work. That said, I'm working 14 hours a day basically every day, weekends included, barely seeing anyone, and I'm starting to feel like I just can't do this anymore. I've become incredibly inefficient because I'm just exhausted and don't have any dopamine left to motivate me to do anything. At the same time, I feel guilty taking breaks.

During law school applications, one school I applied to required that I get a dean's certificate and admin acknowledgement that I was taken off academic probation after a semester. After a lengthy back and forth with the school, they let me know that they had no record of my ever being on academic probation and the only thing they could do is send a letter to the law school I applied to stating that they have no record of my ever being placed on academic probation/disciplined academically. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo for the bar question asking whether I've ever been placed on academic probation - do I answer yes? I don't want any complications where they are not able to reach my school or the right people to get a conclusive answer. They have no record of my being on academic probation or having been disciplined in any way. So am I safe to just put no on my C&amp;F app? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks",

What is more impressive on a resume?
