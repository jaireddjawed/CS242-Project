I originally wanted to be a dental hygienist but wanted to broaden my horizons after this year. So far I've enjoyed the \"lab\" experiences I've had in microbiology with tools such as streaking/performing gram stains/using a microscope so I've been interested in \"working in a lab\" but was wondering if anyone here can provide more in depth information to careers similar to that? People always say work as a lab assistant/technician or in a lab but how would someone specifically look for work under this? I've also been heavily interested in working for my state in any way that my general bio dergree could be used but am unsure how exactly the state would need someone with a bio degree, I'd appreciate any help and stories people could give me!",

Everyone passed it with a hundred easily, and I just failed to understand. And that's why I ask, how do I get better at understanding biology?",

I memorized them based on their names and how they look like in the reference picture, I.e. striated columnar tends to look like layers of columns. For the most part under the microscope I just straight out see no similarity to any type and besides a few that I can identify I am clueless on the rest of them. Does anyone have any advice?",

        "text": "I understand babies being “cute” helps us feel the need to tend to our adorable young, and it releases chemicals that make us happy and *want* to do so. But when we view animals as “cute”, how does that benefit us as humans from an evolutionary standpoint?\n\nIsn’t that a bad thing, since it makes us want to touch/pet or own very dangerous animals? We are curious by nature, which makes sense why we’d want to touch animals for other reasons. But I feel the main reason is because they’re cute and soft\n\nI also understand some animals think we are also cute, such as our own pets (especially dogs). Though generally speaking in nature, animals fear us rather than thinking we’re cute and letting curiosity get the best of them \n\nAll I can find on the internet regarding this subject is that our young use cuteness as a way to manipulate adults to take care of them. Otherwise, I can’t seem to find information on how viewing animals as cute benefits us in any way in nature (which has little to do with babies)\n\nTo add: I’m not just talking about baby animals, but animals as a whole",

If you can point me to a good resource for further learning I’d be thrilled.  Thanks in advance!!",
