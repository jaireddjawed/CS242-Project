        "text": "This question is solely focused on the fact that the 2016 election loss may have benefited the Democrats electorally in subsequent elections after 2016.\n\nIn 2016, if Hillary Clinton become president she would likely have faced a lot of obstacles to govern and would have had poor approval ratings. She would likely have had a Republican House and Senate which meant any signature legislation she wanted to pass would have been impossible hence would have little or no legislative accomplishments. Furthermore, congressional Republicans were hostile to Hillary Clinton since Bengazhi and would have likely have spent a significant amount of time investigating Hillary Clinton. Their opposition to Clinton was nothing to do with Trump, the Bengazhi investigation started a few years before Trump announced his presidential bid.\n\nClinton was already an unpopular figure prior to 2016 and the congressional investigation would have damaged her approval ratings significantly. The 2018 midterms would likely be a red wave as anti-Hillary voters would turnout to vote against the Democrats. The Democratic base would likely be less motivated to vote as there would be no signature legislation passed in Clinton’s first two years. The Democrats would probably have lost congressional control for the next few election cycles.\n\nGoing into 2020, it is likely that Covid pandemic would have occurred and killed thousands in the US. Whilst Hillary would likely have handled the coronavirus better than Trump because there would be no comparison she would have been perceived as mishandling the situation. Congressional Republicans might have initiated impeachment proceedings into Clinton. This likely would have damaged her credibility and the Democratic brand. A Republican victory in that year’s presidential election would have been guaranteed victory. It may have taken many election cycles for the Democrats to recover.\n\nWhilst a Trump victory substantially changed the country, there was likely an electoral benefit to the Democrats as they performed well in the subsequent elections after 2016.",

        "text": "It seems that in most US House races, the primary election effectively determines the winner in the general election. In primary elections, more extreme candidates who appeal to the party's grassroots are favoured compared to moderate candidates. The more extreme candidate may be opposed by their party's hill committee (DCCC or NRCC), but there is not much the DCCC or NRCC can do.\n\nThis likely increases polarisation as more extreme candidates are elected to congress; this occurs on both sides of the aisle. It also makes party discipline much more difficult. Their mandate to become the party's nominee comes from primary voters, not the party leadership. This means they have free reign to vote on any issue based on their own views, not their party's leadership views which are typically more moderate. \n\nIf US House primary elections were scrapped, then the NRCC or DCCC would automatically select the candidates for the general election. These candidates would probably be more moderate. When elected, they would most likely be required to vote with the party leadership unless the leadership gave their rank-and-file members a free vote.  This could improve the party discipline, and members would face expulsion from their caucus if they constantly rebelled. This would mean they couldn't stand as their party's candidate in the following election cycle but only as an independent. \n\nThis may sound extreme, but it is common in European politics, where party discipline in their legislature is much more common as their mandate to become their party's nominee is from the national party, not primary voters. European politics is, therefore, less polarised as candidates are typically less extreme.",

        "text": "Since the election of Trump in 2016, voter turnout has increased massively in both midterm and presidential elections. \n\nIn 2020, there was a record turnout of 62.8% of all eligible voters voting. This was a 7.1pp increase in 2016. It must be noted that mail-in voting was expanded due to COVID, which boosted turnout, but the fact that people were motivated to register to vote implies that more people wanted to make their views heard. This occurred on both sides of the political spectrum, with Biden and Trump having the highest and second-highest voter total of any candidate in US presidential history. Trump had 12 million more votes than in 2016. This implies that people have become more politically active and engaged since 2016.\n\nIn the subsequent midterms, 2018 and 2022, turnout has been much higher since 2016. Midterms usually had low turnouts, with the 2014 midterms being one of the lowest in US history (36.4%). In 2018, turnout increased to one of the highest in US history (49.4%), coinciding with the blue wave. This implied that significant voters wanted to make their views known on the performance of Trump. In 2022, turnout slightly decreased but was still considered high compared to midterm elections before 2018. The presence of Trump was still felt even though he wasn't the sitting president, as the Democrats did better than expected. It must be noted that abortion was another major issue in 2022.\n\nIt seems that the presence of Trump boosted turnout on both sides of the political spectrum and would likely continue if Trump remains at the forefront of US politics. However, if Trump decides against running, turnout could decrease back to pre-Trump days. This is because a sizeable number supported or were against Trump due to his personality, not necessarily his policies.",

        "text": "There is a perception that Biden reversed Trump's protectionist policies, but nothing could be further from the truth. Biden has been as protectionist, if not more than Trump.\n\nFor example, on the issue of China, Biden hasn't reversed any of the tariffs on China. When in opposition, the Democrats were wholly critical of the Trump administration policy. Therefore, their opposition was likely down to politics, not economics. \n\nRegarding trade deals, the Biden administration has been much more reluctant to pursue them. For example, a UK-US trade deal that the Trump administration initiated has been put on hold indefinitely.  Also, Biden has no plans for the US to rejoin the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). It joined the TPP under Obama but withdrew when Trump took office. The perception is that the Biden administration isn't prioritising free trade. \n\nLegislation passed by Biden and the Democrats is protectionist in nature. For example, the CHIPS act involves huge government spending to entice microprocessor companies to relocate their production within the US. Another law is the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). It involves giving companies billions in subsidies to invest in green technologies and build electric cars in the US. Furthermore, any components used must be sourced and manufactured in the US. The IRA has been widely condemned as protectionist in the UK and the EU. \n\nThe actions taken by Biden and the Democrats have been very protectionist. However, the perception is that Trump was much more protectionist than Biden.",

        "text": "This hasn’t been discussed but the Democrats underwhelming performance in the 2020 Senate election cycle may cause them to lose the majority in 2024. This theory is not straightforward but their could be some merit.\n\nThe 2024 Senate cycle is unfavourable for the Democrats and with their slim 51-49 majority, they cannot afford to lose any seats (regardless of who wins the presidency) and remain in the majority. 23 Democratic held seats are up for election compared to 11 Republican held seats. 7 Democratic held seats are in presidential election swing states and 3 are in states won in 2020 (MT, OH and WV). Furthermore, it is difficult to see Democrats gaining any Republican held seats. Therefore, Democrats are all but certain to lose the Senate in 2024, with the likelihood hood the GOP gaining 3 seats. Hence, the  Senate will be 52R - 48D after 2024. This scenario may not have occurred if they performed better in 2020.\n\nIn 2020 the Democrats gained only 3 seats which gave them 50 seats and the majority due to the VP tiebreaker. In an election cycle when Biden won, the Democrats should have gained at least 7 seat (4 more seats). This includes states such as Iowa, Maine, Montana and North Carolina. One of the worst loses was Maine as Biden won that state. Had the Democrats won those 4 additional seats they would have had 54 seats from 2021-23. Therefore, they could have passed more signature legislation.\n\nLet’s assume the 2022 Senate elections occurred as expected with the Democrats gaining 1 seat (PA). They would have 55 seats going into 2024. This would have given them a 4 seat cushion which would have given them a good chance of holding the Senate. \n\nThe fact of the matter is that Senate control is dependent on previous election cycles as only a third of the seats are up for election each cycle.",

It must be noted it was overshadowed by the presidential election.\n\nIn the 2020 House elections, the Democrats were expected to expand their majority but they suffered a net loss of 14 seats. They remained in the majority but their seat total dropped to 222. The Democrats were expected to lose 40+ House seats but actually only lost 9. This still meant they lost their majority. Had the Democrats held or gained seats in 2020 then they would still be in the majority after 2022. They lost more House seats in a presidential election where their candidate compared to a midterm election where their president was the incumbent. The loss of seats due to redistricting in NY and FL would be  irrelevant.\n\nThis leads on to the Senate which is unfavourable to the Democrats in 2024. They are defending 23 seats. 7 of them are in swing states and 3 of them are in states won by Trump in 2020. Let’s assume that the Democrats hold onto the 7 in swing states and only lose MT, OH and WV. They would still lose the majority as it would be 52R - 48D. In 2022, they could only reasonably gain 1 seat (PA) which they did. In 2020, the Democrats only gained 3 seats and became the majority due to the VPs tiebreak.

This would give them at least a 4 seats cushion going into 2024.\n\nFurthermore, with larger houses and senate majorities, the Democrats may have been able to pass more landmark pieces of legislation such as Build Back Better or For the people Act. This would have been potentially consequential.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that the 2020 congressional elections were underwhelming for the Democrats and likely cost them in the two succeeding election cycles (2022 and 2024).",

        "text": "The State of the Union, which occurred in February, was remembered for a lack of decorum as the President and some Members of Congress traded insults with each other. It has seemingly occurring in many SOTUs since Trump became president. Furthermore, the SOTU has become more of a party political broadcast as the president and the response from the opposing party can make speeches without answering questions. This has fuelled partisanship and created a disconnect between congress and the president. This could be improved by requiring the President to testify twice a year before a special congressional committee. Whilst people may invoke the separation of powers, cabinet officials in the executive branch routinely testify to congress.    \n\nThis special congressional committee would likely only include the chairs and ranking members of the highest-ranking committees in the House and Senate. It could last around 2 hours and occur twice a year. Each member would have limited time to ask questions. \n\nThis would improve the functioning of the legislative and executive branches. It would benefit the as congress would have a greater understanding of the president's agenda and could enact legislation where there is a common cause. It would ensure that the president is well-versed in their role and have a general understanding of how government works as they would have to answer hard-hitting questions on the spot. The people elect the president via the electoral college, but there should be greater oversight as he/she is the commander in chief. This oversight should be done by other branches of government, not the media.\n\nOn the flip side, this proposal could increase partisanship as the president and members of congress could use these hearings to grandstand. Also, members of congress could ask 'gotcha' questions, and the president could deflect the question and make his/her own statement instead. This could render it pointless.\n\nThis idea may not solve the discontent and polarisation between the president and congress, but solutions are required to improve harmony between both branches of government.",

        "text": "The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which has a misleading name as it doesn’t necessarily reduce inflation, is a landmark piece of legislation which has not been widely discussed or covered in the USA. One of the most important provision is the $391 billion to combat climate change which has been rarely discussed at all.\n\nIt will significantly help reduce greenhouse gas levels in 2030 towards 2005 levels. This helps us reach the goals set by the Paris Agreement. This is a potential environmental benefit but there are also potential economic benefits.\n\nIt gives companies tax credits to locate in the USA to invest in green energy technologies. This could create green jobs.\n\nIt requires electric car manufacturers to source a majority of components within the US to receive full tax credits.\n\nIt also incentives consumers to buy electric cars and install home heat pumps by giving them tax credits.\n\nThe response from countries and companies has been significant. For example the EU are concern that companies will invest in the USA, an example is BMW whoever announced a $1.7 billion investment in Georgia. The EU wants to take legal action which suggest it is concerned about the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nThe IRA is a potential game changer not just for the US but the rest of the world.",
