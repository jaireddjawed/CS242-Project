        "text": "I have just finished my first semester of grad school. I work 20 hours a week as an engineer and 20 hours as a GRA, with a 12 credit course load, which I understand is pretty normal. Many people discouraged me from doing this but I need to pay my bills.. and loans were not for me. \n\nMy conclusion is that it’s fully doable. I managed to get near perfect grades, get plenty of research done, assist on other projects, and jump onto my own project. My engineering job gave me the finances to still do things like downhill ski, travel, and go on road trips without the stress. I have a clear outline of my tasks that must be completed and an idea of how much time they will take. \n\nThe downside is that your time is extremely limited, as expected. You will not have the flexibility to go grab dinner with friends on a Wednesday night since you might have to be at work at 5 am the next morning. You will give a weekend up to finish running those 18 reactions you finally have the equipment for. Your bedtime will (probably) be 8 pm because you have to cram in 10 hours of work with 3 classes in one day. \n\nAll in all, I don’t hate life! I still get to do the things I love, just at a limited capacity. I’m writing this since I couldn’t find a clear answer on Reddit as to how bad full time graduate school in my field would be with the added responsibility of a career. I figured anecdotal experience would be helpful. Hopefully this helps someone decide if this is for them, especially if finances are the root cause of stress like they were for me. \n\nDisclaimer: I’m getting a MS in mechanical engineering, I assume a phd is a different ball game! Also, I understand it has only been one semester but I know this will be a good representative of next 1.5 years. I worked in the same lab throughout my undergrad.",

        "text": "For background, I currently hold a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science with minors in Biology and Environmental Science and I will be graduating in May with a Master of Science in Legal Studies.\n\nThroughout this past fall semester, I applied to a few Political Science PhD programs (I have not heard back from any yet, as expected). Because money has been tight, I started working a second job. My second job is doing animal husbandry work at an animal shelter (dogs, cats, and rabbits, with the occasional other animal). Because I’m school, I’m working part time but eventually I’ll have the opportunity to go full time with benefits once my probationary period ends (I started a few weeks ago). \n\nI have absolutely loved the job thus far, and honestly it’s the best job I’ve ever had. I used to want to be a zookeeper and then after taking some political science courses and doing research during undergrad, I decided that something more political and teaching university was a better fit. I have held some jobs that are more political and I absolutely loved them. This job, though, has made me start to rethink everything and has reignited my interest and passion for working in animal husbandry.\n\nWould it be wrong or bad to not attend a PhD program if I got accepted to any and go full time at this job instead? I have found a 100% online BS in Zoology program, as well as some relevant graduate degrees and certificates that are offered 100% online that I could do while working, that would then provide the educational background to do animal husbandry in other settings (zoos, animal sanctuaries, etc), and if I had research interests in biology/zoology could pursue a PhD in that field later on. Teaching and getting a PhD is something that has been of interest to me for a long time.\n\nFeeling pretty lost and confused right now, not sure what the best course of action is.

I was so excited at first; I was gonna research the relationship between gut microflora and mental health, but as you might be able to tell this turned out to be pretty difficult to actually do as a thesis specifically and validly enough. I then decided I was going to study the relationship between a certain probiotic fungus on IBS. Again, hard to do as an undergrad student especially since my school is pretty limited research lab wise. Lastly I wanted to do something \"simple\" and was so confident it would be accepted this time: a survey of IBS impact on quality of life of female college students in my region, but my honors thesis professor (kind of an advisor but not really) said \"you really think no one's already researched that\" and \"it's pretty obvious the quality of life will be negatively impacted.\"\n\nThree rejected topics later, and I am done. I really do want to graduate with honors. I'm willing to put in the work. I just need a working topic. It is so intimidating to find a gap in the existing literature... I can't really think of something that hasn't been researched. Do you have any advice? Can be a suggestion for a topic, a poorly researched area, something that is a little bit easier and simpler to carry out that doesn't need IRB approval or lab work. Thank you.",

I constantly think about how people at other universities - ones that are non-religious and are larger in scale - are secured with a better chance at doing post-graduate. \n\nIs that rational at all? Probably no. The formula is simple: GPA of 3.5 and above, keeping up with relationships, and extracurriculars. Should be attainable as long as you're working for it, right?\n\nThing is, with a population of less than 1000 students, one could tell the bar is low. Consequently: low expectations and a stronge sense of idleness (in terms of all things tangible and intangible). \n\nI'm trying to stay optimistic but my battery is draining and time is ticking. Is it true that a bachelor graduate from a Christian university is at a disadvantage comparing to other graduates? What are my chances of getting into the MBA program? What are the values that such a student could bring to an MBA program at a different school? What are the graduate schools looking for in students with a religious background?\n\nThank you in advance for any help and/or suggestion.",

But I’m making a career change and want to get into the field, particularly as a manager/talent acquisition someday. I’d like to get all my certifications, and my BFA is in Illustration so totally unrelated. Currently I’m doing a certificate program at a local community college. I’d like to work in the gaming studio world/tech/creative side, or maybe Disney one day.\n\nSo having said that, what’s the smarter move? Or do I just try to gain experience and do my certifications a few years down the line and no masters at all? I know this question gets asked a lot, so I appreciate the feedback.

It made sense to pursue higher education back then. \n\nHowever, a few months ago I was offered a position working for a local Federal agency that does not require me to have any education above high school diploma. I accepted the position because I have wanted to join the federal workforce for a longtime AND it pays a boat load of money. It paid more than me and my partnered made together.

I did that for a year, amd got a white collar job. I finished my AA, BBA, and now MBA, so I could continue down the white collar path amd try my hand at education. My new job is back to blue collar work and I am okay with it only because of the outrageous pay. \n\nWith all of the previously mentioned information, I am wondering if a PhD is really worth it. I am pretty sure my MBA would get me a white collar job at my current federal agency (this is the gameplan eventually), but I still have a desire to get a doctoral degree. Yet, I do not want to sink a boat load of money into education that I am never going to utilize.  I am at a crossroads...\n\nHas anyone been in a similar position that can guve any advice?",

I plan to write a thesis, so I have to secure a PI no later than the end of the spring 2023 semester. Anything sooner would just be a bonus, giving me more time to get acquainted with the PI, lab group, environment, tools/equipment, etc.\n\nMy goal is to secure a PI in the aerospace engineering department. The mechanical engineering department is totally fine with me doing this, as it has been done by others before.\n\nI delayed my PI search for the first 3 months of the semester because I was mentally preparing to put myself out there without looking like an idiot. Don’t judge me, I have imposter syndrome and social anxiety. 🙄\n\nAnyway, around mid-November, I finally reached out to a potential PI who is doing research related to some of my interests. It seemed like our meeting went really well. We spent like 1.5 hours discussing technical aspects of the research, touring the lab, introducing me to some of the lab members, etc. After I left, we basically made a plan for me to officially transition into the group (which classes I should take in the spring, which software packages I should get comfortable with right away, which research articles I should read, etc.).\n\nHere’s the problem: When I emailed him a week later to schedule a follow-up appointment, he didn’t respond. Understandable — it was Thanksgiving break. I waited another week and sent an email again, and he responded saying that he has been super busy lately and that he will email me later that day to schedule an appointment. I assured him it was no problem. But he didn’t email me later that day.\n\nI know he must be super busy with deadlines and meetings and other stuff right now (end of semester, right before the holidays — bad timing on my part tbh), so I really don’t want to pester him too much. I sent him a friendly email during this winter break with a little status update regarding our original plan, but no response as of yet.\n\nSo I need y’all’s advice ASAP, because idk what to do. I hear PIs usually suck at responding to emails. Should I email him again when the spring semester begins, and then wait patiently until he responds? Or should I let my pessimistic side assume the worst, start emailing other potential PIs and essentially give up on this one?\n\nAnother thing is like, if I start emailing other PIs, should I email them 1 at a time? Like, is it considered bad practice to email multiple PIs at once, just to end up saying yes to one of them and no to the others?\n\n🆘",
