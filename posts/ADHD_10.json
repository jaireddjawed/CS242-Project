It's like everybody else in my friend group is a fully-fledged adult but I'm just a kid who's still \"training\" to be an adult. I've always been a bit of an outcast (having undiagnosed ADHD and Autism for most of my life until this year) but I always felt more mature than everyone else until 6th form, where suddenly I was the childish one and everyone else was grown up. It's like I grew up entirely by 13 years old and just stayed there whilst everyone else grew up at a normal pace, and now I'm the one stuck behind and it doesn't really seem like I'm growing up anymore. It feels like I'm my kid self operating an adult body. I'm so scared of dropping out of university when I get there because I might struggle to cope by myself. I really can't ever see myself working a full 9 to 5 in the future without having a full mental breakdown. I just can't see myself as an independent adult despite being hyper-independent my entire life. Does anybody else feel this way?",

To begin with medication was great as it allowed me to focus more on the task in hand and was commented by my training partners that it seemed to have increased my ability. \n\n\n\nTo cut a long story short at some point that I can't pin point my  medication  for some reason started to worsen my ability to compete. For example:\n\n\n-Almost no reaction time, whilst fencing I can watch in real time, aware that I'm being stabbed but not reacting. If I do react ifs slow, late and heavy. My reaction time whilst driving is unaffected.\n\n\n-From the outside it looks like I'm not trying from my opponents pov apparently and am being lazy/ bored.\n\n\n\n-There are no feelings of aggression or adrenaline. Someone could be trying to choke the life out of me during a judo session and my demeanor remains calm. \" Oh they are choking me, this is fine\" type thing.\n\n\nI've really no idea what's caused this or how to fix it. If I don't take meds I can compete like I used to before medication but it comes with the bonus of making that day a write off for literally anything else.\n\n\nIf anyone has any ideas as to how or why or what to do then please share.",

He wants friends, and tells me that he goes around asking kids to be his friend. He has told me that he plays by himself at recess, but that’s it’s okay, because he likes playing by himself😭. His teacher excitedly told me when he made a friend, but I believe  it was short lived. He can tend to talk loudly, sometimes he interrupts. Also it may take him awhile to get his thoughts together when he talks. He’s not very sporty, and he’s not a tough boy, like a lot of the boys in his class. He’ll be starting a baseball team in about a week, so I’m hoping he’ll make friends there and take to the sport. In addition, I dont get help from his father teaching him to ride a bike, tie his shoes, catch a ball, learn sports, and more things that would help him relate to other children and build skills. I have given up on trying for his help and just trying to tackle this alone. I try role playing with him at home but I’m not sure it’s enough. I guess I’m just wondering if anyone can provide any resources that may have worked for them as a child, or if any parents can tell me what may have assisted their children socially. He has a few buddies outside of school but not at school. I’m looking into getting him into social skills group settings in our area. He’s also in speech and occupational therapy. I just wanna help him, he’s a fun loving kid that can come off socially different to his peers. Thank you.",

I have to stay so hyper vigilant and force myself to pay attention in class and my grades have been suffering as a result, and I’m honestly not happy. I cannot for the life of my pay attention to homework and any readings are completely out of the question as the task is just so daunting. I’ve always kinda been this way with school, but still managed to achieve good grades due to the fear of punishment or disappointment by my father. This was the driving factor in my success in school.  They were not the type to seek out external help for behavioral issues other than antidepressants (didn’t work tried 3-4) and discipline. \n\nI don’t know if it’s because now that I’m at college and more independent, or if it’s because my brain is just developing further, but I’m feeling like these mental symptoms are getting worse. I’m pretty lethargic all the time, and constantly seek external stimulation in the form of nicotine and copious amounts of green hits. Virtually the only time I’m on task is after a green hit with a zyn in my lip.  This is not to mention all of the negative self talk that happens in my head, as well as a lack of self confidence and low self esteem despite doing things to combat that (socialize, regular exercise, healthy ish diet).\n\nAnyways, I got 2 10mg adderall XR and took them this morning, and i feel cured. I don’t think about green, I don’t think about going on my phone when doing tasks, everything seems more logical, and I’m not as scattered. I don’t misplace things I had in my hand 5 seconds ago, and I can hold conversations better with less awkwardness. \n\nI want to seek a diagnosis but I don’t want to seem like a drug seeker, especially with the shortage happening. I feel like this medication can really help me get my life back on track and just overall improve the quality of it, but I am lost as to where to start. Any advice is appreciated.\n\nTLDR: struggled staying on task throughout life among other issues, took 20mg adderall XR, problem fixed. Need guidance on diagnosis.",

        "text": "Hi everyone, I’m trying to connect the dots about a symptom I’ve had for years. I believe it’s described as air hunger, like the feeling that you’re not getting enough oxygen, even though you can breathe fine. Today I noticed it happened while I was feeling extremely “antsy” and restless, and very understimulated (I was at my university for 8 hours, two professors unexpectedly cancelled their lectures and the remaining lesson was extremely boring because it was a recap of very basic stuff. So basically I sat with nothing to do for hours, it was a pretty hellish day). And I felt that distinct understimulation feeling all day, along with air hunger. (Also: I experience anxiety, but I wasn’t anxious or worried at all today, and have no reason to be in the foreseeable future, so I don’t think that’s it)\n\nI’ve heard about some people with ADHD who experience air hunger, and they all thought it was because of stimulants, but I’m not on any medication. Has anyone else ever experienced this? \n\nTLDR: I experienced air hunger along with undersimulation, could they be connected? I’m not on any med, which other ppl with ADHD believe to be the culprit",

        "text": "I (21f) originally met this friend (21f) more than a year ago through mutual friends. We got along really well since our personalities were so similar, and although I wasn’t super close to her, I would see her in a lot of social contexts.\n\nI was diagnosed with ADHD last July, and have been on medication since then. I’m on Vyvanse now, which works great because I basically feel like I don’t have ADHD anymore!\n\nAnyway, this friend is now in one of my classes, so of course we sit together and work together. Being around her in this context has made me feel really annoyed at her. I feel so bad, because she is genuinely such a sweet and caring person. But she almost 100% has undiagnosed ADHD, and I’d argue it’s even *worse* than my ADHD before I got diagnosed.\n\nShe shows up very late to class, is always forgetting her stuff, and always acts so confused in class. I know these are all traits I used to display for most of my life, and yet I can’t stop getting annoyed in my head every time I’m around her. I almost feel like she’s a kid sometimes and I’m her parent, but I know I used to have a similar dynamic with certain people in the past where I felt like I was the child. \n\nI also realized the reason we clicked when we first met was because we had so many ADHD symptoms in common, but I no longer really “possess” these traits on my medication, so I don’t feel like I have this connection with her anymore. I know I’m definitely projecting because I feel similarly about my mom, who definitely has undiagnosed ADHD. Instead of laughing along with her when she does something inattentive like I used to, I find myself getting irrationally annoyed (but it’s not as bad as it is with this one friend). \n\nI feel like such a terrible person, but it’s gotten to the point where I almost can’t stand to be around her. I really want to work on these feelings, and I know it’s most likely because I still have a lot of self-hatred toward my unmedicated/undiagnosed self.\n\nI know I’m projecting, and I know this friend is really sweet, but how can I deal with this when it comes up? I’m sure I can’t be the only one to have experienced something like this since being diagnosed.",

        "text": "Hi \n\nI've been meaning to ask this question for awhile. I was wondering what people's experience was in taking Adderall and doing complex/multi-part step problems, i.e math and programming. Adderall is great for speeding me up and compiling information but actually causes my short term memory to become worse. All through college when I took tests and took Adderall beforehand my mind ended up becoming too sped up and I ended up failing. Even when I spent copious amounts of time studying. This was only the case for math exams or high level econ courses (which involved math). Anything reading/writing related I did pretty well. \n\nThe trade-off was not taking Adderall but then if I didn't take Adderall, I would just dick around and not doing any studying at all. There is a good chance I have dyscalculia which is often co-morbid with ADD/ADHD but I've noticed a pretty steep cognitive decline in short term memory.  Trying to find a balance has been difficult since Adderall is great at making monotonous routine tasks seem interesting. Has anyone else had this experience? sorry if this comes across as incoherent rambling, can't you tell I have ADD? :)",

I am already on a low dose of adderall but unfortunately cannot increase the dose because I am bipolar and it could induce mania. \n\nI can’t even watch a video without having to rewind it and rewatch it multiple times because I keep zoning off or start to maladaptive daydream (a term I just learned- look it up!). Also, I have had to learn a lot of stuff in a short period of time and at moments really struggle to remember things. One moment I know it, the next is like I don’t know anything. I have the basics down but really need to be able to focus to be able to successfully study to pass certification exams. I usually just cram close to the exam date and have been successful in the past doing so but the problem is that I don’t retain the information long-term so I need to change this into a way that will keep knowledge fresh in my mind even after I have my certs. \n\nWhat behaviors/pointers do you have that would make my life easier? I haven’t even been able to enjoy any of my hobbies because I can’t stand to spend more than 5 minutes on something. I haven’t even read anything outside of work required readings besides poetry because I keep having to reread the same things over again because I keep zoning out and reading used to be one of my favorite hobbies. \n\nI can’t watch television for the same reason. My mind is constantly like next, next, next with everything. I have cut coffee down to one cup in the am and it has made no difference. I have been breaking my studying into smaller session (study for 30 mins to 1 hour, break for 10-15 etc.) but sometimes is hard for me to get back into focus mode so maybe this is a bad approach? Also, it is hard for me to articulate my thoughts because my brain works faster than my mouth does and it’s hard for me to spit my thoughts out when new ones are being processed so I’m constantly having to change directions when I speak so it’s probably hard for others to follow. \n\nHow do I slow down my thought patterns from constantly shifting? It is like a constant reel that never stops. I actively try to be present and focus but my mind is like nope time to go on a journey. Meditation used to help but I can’t even get through a short session of that anymore. Any advice?",

Because I hate working my brain naturally comes up with ways to work smarter not harder, which leads to me proposing new and more efficient workflows and ideas which has definitely helped me be recognized by my managers, and it feels amazing to finally be valued and appreciated. \n\nIf it wasn't for getting on meds I would have been gone a long time ago. It helps me do my job with less resistance, but the adderall honeymoon phase has been over for a long time, so I don't feel the extra boost of socializing being more enjoyable anymore, so i've gone back to being super anti-social. I hate talking to people (which is 90% of my job) having pointless conversations with coworkers and have heard I look very unapproachable. I actually have very negative feelings towards a lot of my coworkers hence using the term \"anti-social\" (literally). I only enjoy conversations that are interesting and have an actual purpose or if I'm super peaking on my meds which is rare now. \n\nMy manager has put a huge emphasis on my need to develop relationships with my coworkers and learn how to have difficult conversations with them and have more of an outgoing and friendly presence in the clinic with this new position (I start tomorrow). \n\nMy question is how the heck do people do it... how do you get yourself to listen to someone ramble on and on about their cream of chicken crockpot recipe, how do you force yourself to be friendly and say good morning to people and actually feel/sound genuine? It feels so against the grain and unnatural to me. I'm worried I'm going to fail miserably being in a leadership position because I suck at being social, and I'm terrible at faking it. If you talk to me about something I'm not interested in I will literally just stare into space and be like \"mhm oh wow\" and think of ways to escape the conversation the entire time. I also never initiate conversation with anyone because I'm afraid I'll say something stupid or initiate at the wrong time and then I feel stupid and awkward. \n\nTL;DR: Got a promotion to a leadership position but my ADHD causes me to have terrible social skills.

If you are triggered by things like this, keep yourself safe, and skip. \n\nI’m curious how prevalent self harm can be amongst those with adhd, as well as if others had similar reasons for harm. \n\nI started pretty young, around the same time I started to struggle with depression (but also with what I now know was adhd symptoms). \n\nI often hear about people who self harm for release, but I never did that. I did it as a “punishment”. Because I felt I wasn’t good enough. \n\nWhen my depression started I began struggling to do things like school, homework, and chores much worse than I did before. I always worried I was letting my mother down. Especially because before then I was an A B student. This fear only doubled when I overheard my mom say she was disappointed in me once. She’s since apologized a dozen times but it was really damaging for me at the time. \n\nDid anyone else do this? Inflict self punishment?",

        "text": "Getting out of bed has always been difficult, until I started back on Adderall in 2020. Initially, it helped a lot with getting out of bed, but as a lot of us know, many of the initial effects of Adderall and other stimulants may diminish, or even disappear completely after long term use. \n\nSchedule: I usually will schedule an alarm to take my 20mg adderall xr at 7 am, then I'll go back to sleep til 8am, where I'll hit snooze until 8:10 or 8:20 then wake up for work. I can get through the day fine, until I feel the Xr wearing off, and I'll take a 7.5mg IR at around 5-6pm. \n\nWhen I described this to my NP she said I should not be using adderall to wake up in the morning. I need to talk to her again at the end of this month, but I wondered if anyone else has had experience with this? To an extent, I can agree that I'm using it to wake up, but if I don't do this, and try to wake up naturally, it's probably 10x as hard to actually get out of bed and do anything. \n\nI am not sure if I am considered \"addicted\" or \"dependent\" on adderall, but the fact is that if you take adderall for 3 years, then when your body does not have any adderall, your body hates you. Giving it a 1hr warm up for when I actually need to wake up has helped getting out of bed manageable for me, while being \"dependent\" on adderall.",

        "text": "What a roller coaster this has been. \n\nBackstory: I was diagnosed about 10 years ago with ADHD by my GP. I was on Lexapro and Vyvanse. I was doing well mentally, but the physical side effects of Lexapro (tummy issues, 40 lb weight gain, sexual side effects, etc.) were terrible. I decided to get off all meds and rebuild my life. Now I'm taking Wellbutrin and Buspar, but still have massive issues with motivation, concentration, and focus, I'm frustrated and wanted to work with someone that specialized in ADHD to make sure 1. I actually do have mild ADHD and 2. that we can work on ways to manage it. I chose telehealth because I had been using Lyra to manage my meds for anxiety/depression through a workplace benefit, but my husband left that job so we no longer have access. I really enjoyed it because I met with my practitioner every 6 weeks, instead of once a year. I was hoping for a similar experience with DONE.\n\nExperience with DONE: I signed up with DONE in January and got an appointment a few days later. My clinician was nice, but asked broad questions and honestly wasn't as thorough as I hoped he would have been. He prescribed Azstarys, and said we only had to meet every 6 months. I was a bit surprised by that news considering I was going to be paying a monthly fee... for them to prescribe me medication every month? I didn't like the sound of that. \n\nI had asked DONE if they worked with any mail order pharmacies because my insurance plan gets me the best deal on medications if I use their mail order pharmacy. Plus, it just arrives to my door every month and I don't have to stress about making it to the pharmacy. I had never tried to get a controlled substance via mail order.\n\nThey submitted the prescription to the pharmacy and the pharmacy reached out to my practitioner multiple times and heard nothing. The pharmacy kept calling me to see I could get the practitioner to call them, but he only answered one of my messages. Eventually he stopped responding to me all together. \n\nThe pharmacy refused to fill the prescription because it was a telehealth practitioner. I reached out to DONE's customer service and stopped trying to reach my practitioner. CS asked me for a local pharmacy, so I gave them two pharmacies that were in network and close to my house. And then nothing. They never submitted the prescription to the pharmacies. \n\nAll in all this took two months and after asking for a refund for a month, they finally issued one. They refused to give me a full refund because I had been \"diagnosed\" and given a \"treatment plan\". I got $90 of the $200 back (anyone know who I could file a complaint with?)\n\nTLDR: DONE cannot prescribe controlled substances, but will anyways. Check out their instagram comments to more stories like mine.",

The teachers always complained that he was distracted a lot and did not stay still but they say that being with me makes him be calmer. \n\nI am aware of adhd is not only not to concentrate and not be able to stay still, but it costs him a lot to attend, every 15 minutes he is distracted with an impressive ease and sometimes he stares into the air in his thoughts and even does not hear me call him, cannot attend classes and is unable to do two things at the same time \n\nHe can’t keep his legs still and both he and I can’t sit in the same position for a few minutes, when a strong emotion happens he gets up from a jump off the chair and walks a couple of steps to sit down again.He hanges of emotions out of the blue he likes to call them \"shoots\" can be quiet and out of nowhere hit the pen with the table for no reason\n\nSometimes when he is boring makes some meaningless sound in the air and is not able to be silent too long, he has also told me that he tells him to control his emotions and usually feel them enough, when he gets angry he usually assaults any object he has to unleash his anger. \n\n\nHe is a very empathetic person and cares about his friends, he is also very affectionate and hugs people very easily (with me he does not do it because I have told him that I do not tolerate physical contact but he does not know that I am autistic)\n\nHe swings in the chair at all times and is just as meticulous with his order as I. \n\nHe usually touches his hair and his earlobe at all times and has commented me that it is something he does since childhood and has not found explanation but that usually relax him. \n\nThen he has foolish mistakes in exams so he cannot pass math and he has a lot of facility to lose things and forget entrusted tasks. A few weeks ago I asked him to pass me some notes (a Friday), he answered me later (usually takes time to him to answer) and told me that I was going to pass them already. but he was distracted forgot and remembered on Sunday. \n\nHe has a lot of sleep problems, it takes him too much to make decisions and usually act without thinking\n\nHe has an impressive memory for details, as I am autistic I had not yet met anyone who had it just like me. \n\nHe never understands my sarcasm, but I may not know how to do well for my autism.\n\nSometimes he can be very clumsy with his hands and when I told him the possibility of having attention deficit in joke told me that he did not believe because when he make an activity that likes a lot he can be very focused on his and forget about the around but I think it can be hyperfocus. \n\nThe last thing that makes me think about the possibility of having adhd is that normally a person nt can not be with me so many hours in a row as it usually bump the way of being and end up being a little annoying or weird without creating an uncomfortable situation 😅, but it hasn’t happened we spend it talking very easily and the teachers say that we understand each other perfectly, none wants to change places and we are very comfortable with the presence of the other.",

        "text": "Relationship When You Have ADHD Tips\n\nTLDR; Trying to make a list of ways I can make good habits, be considerate, and function in a relationship with someone who doesn’t necessarily share my ADHD experiences. Any help would be great.\n\nI am making a list of things that could benefit me and my partner in my current relationship. This relationship is new, though I’ve already had two instances where my ADHD shined through and caused some issues. \n\nThe first issue was me getting way overstimulated, but my partner actually helped me through that moment. I generally get extra shaky, super confused, all over the place even more than I already am, zoning out/dissociating, and my speech gets even more fast and impaired. Usually I try to run away from things and escape to spend a certain amount of time bringing myself back to my feet. My partner helped me in the moment, however, by sitting me down when he noticed I was getting speech impaired, confused and agitated. What he did in that moment was that he sat me down away from other people, rubbed my back, spoke softly, and just took breaths with me. He also checked in several times, told me to do specific things, and kind of brought me back at least halfway to my feet. It was nice.\n\nHowever, this post is more about ways that I can communicate through my own inhibitions to help him understand different things about how I react/how I am (even while medicated lol), and how I can be considerate of his needs.\n\nThe second issue falls more in line with what I am making a list about. Basically without going into too much detail, I get excitable and blurt things out at times, and what happened was I shared with a friend something that I thought was cute, and the friend brought that up when meeting my partner, and things got tense and awkward because it is a new relationship and he is not used to being with someone as excitable as me I think. It turned out okay because he and I had a talk about it, however I still feel shame for “doing something wrong”. Also something I had to keep in mind is that I’m quite involved in the gay community where as he is kind of someone who has been an “invisible” gay person as in he hasn’t been involved as much externally as I have. So I suppose I am a little more open and visible where he is more reserved, and I have to remind myself of this. I also just generally have to think more before I speak, so tips on that would be great.\n\nMy list is basically this so far —\n\n- What type of support do you need right now: Problem solve or listen? (asking “do you want me to help figure this out or would you just like me to hear you) because I often jump into ways I can help. \n- Reminders to self about being considerate in the moment, take a breath before speaking or ask for a moment to be purposefully silent\n- Careful with excitable sharing, if I don’t know whether it’s okay or not or haven’t considered whether it is, do not share until I’ve asked permission/spoken about sharing boundaries with partner\n\nThats about all I have so far. Anything else to help would be great. This relationship is new and I want to make better habits right now. Am also speaking to my therapist today so will update on what things she helps me come up with.",

The teachers always complained that he was distracted a lot and did not stay still but they say that being with me makes him be calmer. \n\nI am aware of adhd is not only not to concentrate and not be able to stay still, but it costs him a lot to attend, every 15 minutes he is distracted with an impressive ease and sometimes he stares into the air in his thoughts and even does not hear me call him, cannot attend classes and is unable to do two things at the same time \n\nHe can’t keep his legs still and both he and I can’t sit in the same position for a few minutes, when a strong emotion happens he gets up from a jump off the chair and walks a couple of steps to sit down again.He hanges of emotions out of the blue he likes to call them \"shoots\" can be quiet and out of nowhere hit the pen with the table for no reason\n\nSometimes when this boring makes some meaningless sound in the air and is not able to be silent too long, he has also told me that he tells him to control his emotions and usually feel them enough, when he gets angry he usually assaults any object he has to unleash his anger. \n\n\nHe is a very empathetic person and cares about his friends, he is also very affectionate and hugs people very easily (with me he does not do it because I have told him that I do not tolerate physical contact but he does not know that I am autistic)\n\nHe swings in the chair at all times and is just as meticulous with his order as I. \n\nHe usually touches the hair and the earlobe at all times and has commented me that it is something he does since childhood and has not found explanation but that usually relax. \n\nThen he has foolish mistakes in exams so he cannot pass math and he has a lot of facility to lose things and forget entrusted tasks. A few weeks ago I asked him to pass me some notes (a Friday), he answered me later (usually takes to answer) and told me that I was going to pass them already. but he was distracted forgot and remembered on Sunday. \n\nHe has a lot of sleep problems it takes too much to make decisions and usually act without thinking\n\nHe has an impressive memory for details, as I am autistic I had not yet met anyone who had it just like me. \n\nHe never understands my sarcasm, but I may not know how to do well for my autism.\n\n\nSometimes he can be very clumsy with his hands and when I told him the possibility of having attention deficit in joke told me that he did not believe because when he make an activity that likes a lot he can be very focused on his and forget about the around but I think it can be hyperfocus. \n\nThe last thing that makes me think about the possibility of having adhd is that normally a person nt can not be with me so many hours in a row as it usually bump the way of being and end up being a little annoying or weird without creating an uncomfortable situation 😅, but it hasn’t happened we spend it talking very easily and the teachers say that we understand each other perfectly, none wants to change places and we are very comfortable with the presence of the other",

Sha was always warm and nice with me, we could talk about music and tv shows even when we had work to do in the office, specially about TLOU. Then from one day to another she began to act odd. From one day to another there was no more talk and no interest, just common polite office work(? i guess. Something like \"hey good morning, nice, etc\" but nothing else.\n\ni'm soo confused. Months ago, i told her about my adhd diagnosis (i'm 23) that i just recently had, she also has a son with adhd but well, he is a kid. So with all of this i'm very sure that i said or did something very stupid without the intention to harm or perhaps i wasn't very tactful (i'm struggling with that). Last friday i tried to talk with her but i just froze with a bitter feeling in my chest, so i send her a message. I went to the \"no personal thing\" route, and yes, she's having problems, but nothing else according to what she said.\n\nBut then this week the behavior still's the same, at least towards me. With other coworkers from the friendship circle she remains warm and nice, with me... well, just polite but nothing else.\n\ni don't know what i did to her, but it was really bad. I don't know how to approach to her and what to say in a proper way, and btw, it's a little bit awkward because we used to talk and then suddenly, nothing .\n\nSo, right now i'm looking for advice in this situation, i want to know what i did and how to fix it and even how i can prevent this in a not so distant situation",

He’s the kind of guy who wants things done straight away and his way. On top of that, his attention to hygiene and germs is higher than most (he’s described it as OCD tendencies) where if we go out at all, even if it’s 5 minutes, we must put our belongings in a UV sanitizer AND shower afterwards. \n\nRedirecting myself to do general house chores or what he asks has been difficult, as my mind needs time to transition from one thing to the next. I feel that my BF often treats me like a child because of this. Adderall’s made these transitions easier, but it’s not 100% perfect (noticing bouts of major depression from taking it daily). Does anyone have recommendations on how to direct myself to necessary tasks more quickly before my BF asks me to do them? How would I also approach the subject of being treated like an adult?",

They gave it to the other person that applied because long story short and to put it simply, they need someone whos more of a bitch and isn't afraid to crack down on people. Which is fair. (But also I know she's gonna go through hell) My feedback was very good and I've been offered another position created basically just for me and would utilize my creative skills.\n\nI had come to the conclusion in the waiting period that maybe the supervisory position wasn't right for me because some of the higher ups here are difficult to work with.  And the extra pay isn't worth the extra stress. Also due to my difficulties with my mental health would I even be able to keep up?\n\nAnyway, even writing this down has helped a bit. Unfortunately I was told at the start of my shift which has frazzled me slightly. I'm trying not to spiral into \"im not good enough\" territory. I don't particularly feel like I was criticized harshly or anything but obviously just being rejected is making me want to squirt tears at the next person that talks to me. If it hadn't been for the fact that I'd already had doubts I would probably be at home now with a crying induced migraine. Rejection sensitivity is fucking shit.\n\nThe fact that they've made a new role for me is good and not just a \"sympathy for the idiot\" thing is it? Riiiiight?",

Did it help out? My nurse is hesitant to change my dosage again or change my medication altogether before trying alternatives for managing my anxiety - it has been bad enough that I have missed almost three months of lectures, so I am quite desperate to try new methods to help reduce the anxiety I am experiencing.\n\nAny information is highly appreciated, thank you !! :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR what is your experience using beta blockers with vyvanse for anxiety?",

He didn’t seem to understand that I can watch the video and listen at the same time.",
