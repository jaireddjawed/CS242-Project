I knew job postings sometimes had ridiculous expectations but how is a student expected to have more than 3 years of full time industry experience?? That is insane. It would be understandable if they copied this from a posting for a full time position but they refer to it being an \"internship\" so many times in the job posting. Even if they were mostly targeting the masters students 3+ yoe is ridiculous for an internship\n\nty for coming to my ted talk",

I dropped my resume off (which doesn't contain my GPA), and a technical recruiter later reached out to me via email saying that I could be a good fit for the company. \n\nIn this email, she asked general questions like graduation date, whether I need visa sponsorship, etc. At the bottom though, she asked me to include my unofficial transcript. This company's online application for the same role requires a minimum of 3.3 GPA.\n\n I transferred from CC, so my CC GPA is great \\~3.5, 3.6. My university GPA though, is a 2.4. Even if I include both and average them, it still wouldn't meet the minimum threshold that they have on their online application. I don't plan on letting this opportunity go without trying, as it is a company I am genuinely interested in working at, but I am worried that they will see my university GPA and retract their interest.\n\nMy question is, how do I go about replying to this initial recruiter email:\n\n* Do I attach both transcripts, and not explain anything with hopes that they don't mind and proceed to the interview stages? (I feel like this might make it harder to explain myself if they decide to reject me after seeing the GPA)\n\nor..\n\n* Do I attach both transcripts and address the elephant in the room myself, maybe by highlighting my more desirable traits as a potential engineer? If this is the better option, do you recommend any other approaches I can take to make make myself more hirable here? \n\nPlease let me know, thank you!",

        "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nNew grad from OSU.\n\nBackground:\n\nI started at this company about four months ago. It's a consulting firm so you can envision the kind of conditions I'm working under. I was recently assigned a greenfield project with a deadline of about two months (like 20 real work days iirc due to break). Management needed something to present to clients at a retail conference but had nothing concrete and only the inklings of an idea. I was told that this project was for an in-person retail environment. It needed to connect to our ERP system (full-stack), demonstrate an E2E workflow with appointments and fitting rooms (try-on in-store), and besides that it was up to my creativity to drive the project to completion. They told me they only needed a working demo but even that seemed like a stretch for an associate since a working demo still requires a concept, workflows, business rules, ideas, specs, things of that sort which didn't exist at the time. In regards to help, our senior developer doesn't work with the tech used for this project so I was pretty much on my own. \n\nProject Details:\n\nAt this point, I had only worked with their tech stack for about 5 weeks. Since it was a full-stack app, I knew that it was critical my architectural and design decisions were on point. I've read books such as Clean Code and Code Complete so I had some idea how to structure an application like this. For the concept, I struggled with the problem domain of fitting rooms and appointments. Both of these things can be very complicated with lots of room for error so I expanded it into a full retail management system. I conceptualized an inventory audit system for daily appointments, expanded the appointment aggregate into appointments before check-in vs. after check-in (had to figure out all the data models), and created immutable workflows that could easily be scaled up and divided for large retail stores.\n\nFor the front-end (Angular), I employed a robust component-level architecture that made it easy to ignore details and develop quickly. I used facades, smart + dumb components, and E2E type coverage. I'm not very artistic but I used the four-color theorem to create a status system that related information about clients, fitting rooms, and appointments in a uniform way to increase information efficiency (important in retail), and it looks really cool. Since this demo had to connect to an ERP system to persist appointment and payment details, I put a large amount of effort in building a functioning middle-end with a domain layer + more to protect the integrity of the application. I wanted to show that this design could easily be expanded to different ERP systems and front-end frameworks if we contained the business logic in a middle-end as well as designed the proper layers to encapsulate it. I also knew that appointments could be a tricky matter with their complex logic for cancelling and rescheduling (especially when tied to real-world rooms that need to be stocked), and since this is connected to multiple front-end apps for scheduling, a domain layer could make sure that all appointment logic is protected and consistent across multiple apps.\n\nAftermath:\n\nSo I finished the project on time and it was presented at the conference. From what I've heard (I didn't get to attend), it was a smashing success. Many clients were interested in how practical and robust the design was, its potential for expansion, and were intrigued how easily it could be integrated into their own front-ends and ERP systems (theoretically). Internally, multiple high-level execs of the firm flew out to attend the event, and I was invited to a few meetings where the project was demoed to employees; however, I've still received no personal recognition for the project outside of my direct managers. Clients are in the process of being made actionable, and they've said I'll be developing it more in the coming months but still as an associate. It all feels like a dream at this point, and I'm just so confused what this means for me as a developer.\n\nI mean I went to community college because I graduated high-school with a 1.46 GPA (got expelled from private school, had to do online school my senior year). I transferred to my state school's CS program, and even there I sucked. I skipped class, pissing off my teachers and taking massive grade penalties for doing so, all so I could smoke weed, party, game, and hang out with my girlfriend. To my benefit, I did hyper-fixate on programming from a young age, reading my first books on C++ and C# at the age of 11 but people I've talked to say that doesn't really matter in the real-world; and I guess I have an IQ of 127 but that's never really helped me either with school (and it's balanced out by my ADHD). \n\nSo help me understand, what the hell happened and what does it all mean!? Am I just finding out now that I'm some sort of 10x programmer (if those exist) or is it more realistic that I worked on an easy project with only a superficial understanding of development, and corporate hype is blowing things out of proportion? To be honest though, I feel like after this project - with what I've learned - I could do something so much larger that it's giving me delusions of grandeur. I was planning on staying an associate for a couple years but would there be other opportunities for me after this greenfield project? Idk, these are my thoughts. Reality check me senior developers.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRandy Selimi",

        "text": "For example, I'm a few years into my career and on another job hunt. I often see jobs that ask for something like \"3+ years of experience working with TypeScript\". I haven't worked with TypeScript before but I've watched a TypeScript crash course and understood it immediately. The core concepts are ones I've been deeply familiar with for years. I'm confident I could work on any TypeScript code base and the only difficulty is the same one for all new jobs: getting familiar with the existing code base.\n\nLuckily I've had managers in the past that understand this. Despite not knowing the tech stack, I was hired on because \"it's just learning the syntax\".\n\nBut I don't feel like HR/recruiters know this. Most jobs I see have specific technologies listed in the \"required\" section when it would be more accurate to just list \"object oriented programming\" or \"model-view-controller architecture\" as required and specific technologies as \"recommended\".\n\nIs this valid or am I off base here? If it's valid, how do you deal with it?",

But when it comes to working on a critical project, he acts like he's completely insane. \n\nHe asks for things to be done in 1 hour that take like 2-4 hours, and when advised about using data sources prone to error, he doesn't care so we do things the wrong way then he wants to know why the data is inconsistent/incorrect. \n\nDoesn't trust anyone on our team to do their job. I spend 3 hours cleaning/putting together a 500k dataset only to find out he had his own copy of the data that he took previously and made all these changes to without telling anyone, not even me, and then randomly brings us back in later and sends over his dataset he did who knows what with, and now we have to just start using his again. But we can't have our own file. Have to work off of his excel file. \n\nPoor communicator. He chooses intentionally to leave key members of the team out of the loop, and only educate them/inform them at the exact time something is needed from them, but by that point, they have no idea what is going on. Who does that?\n\nHas been repeatedly advised against using inaccurate data sources instead of our analytics export tool created by data engineering, but chooses to use inaccurate data tables anyway, and then acts incredibly shocked/surprised when data is not correct\n\nWhen we identify data that is incorrect, he tells us not to fix it/remove it because even though lots of the data is flat out wrong, \"we communicated this already so we have to leave it so the numbers look the same\". Since we communicated something wrong, we'll just leave it so the numbers look the same? Like, what? Wouldn't we want to cleanup the bad data and simply admit \"We found some inconsistencies in the data from our data source, and cleaned this up\"... um.. right\n\nHe gets stuck on figuring out who did something wrong to the point where it's completely obsessive. We're in the middle of a project and we need to deliver on the project/results, but he finds it more important to identify who did what wrong, and ensure they're at fault rather than fix it and get the project through to completion\n\nSchedules meetings with other people/teams, and jumps into the call late, on their phone while driving. We're supposed to be reviewing and deep diving into data. The other manager has their camera on, you're driving in your car. Like how does he get away with that or think that's ok? You can't view data while driving. He arrives to every meeting at least 2-5 minutes late, often times driving somewhere *during work hours* while literally everyone else is at their desk on camera\n\nSimply does not understand how data works, at all. Has no knowledge of anything past a vlookup, that's the extent of their data knowledge. Also doesn't keep formulas in any excel workbook, just repeatedly types formula as needed, copy and paste as values so we always have to re-do it over, and over, and over. I tried using Power Query to save time, and he told me not to do that, it can't be trusted, that's not as safe as using just excel, not even using tables, just static ranges\n\nCalls people on their personal phones all the time because they're obviously not at their computer over half the time. Whenever they need anything done, there isn't a realistic expectation of time given. Nope. It's \"i need it now\" and if you provide a realistic estimate of how long it takes it's always \"that's not fast enough. I need it at x time. thanks\". Literally the most unrealistic expectations ever\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow do people manage? I don't get it.",

Offer is from last year and start date is April, I had pushed it back once to avoid layoffs. I’m not sure what I should do and it basically boils down to the three options below.\n\nSomethings I wanted to add before are: \n- First is that I left my first job after 1.5 years and this jump would be similar so don’t know if it would be a red flag if I go to this new company and need to leave in under 2 years. Additionally if I don’t get promoted at Amazon I’ll be a high YoE SDE1 which could be an issue\n- Second is that I have no ill will against current team, they’re amazing, it’s just money really. WLB and PTO are great, can take off whenever. Amazon is now 3 days in office which isn’t awful but a consideration\n- Third is that I’m worried that if I turn down this FAANG offer that I won’t be able to get another one and this would be a big career screw up to say no. I don’t plan to stay there or in a FAANG company for a long time but rather to learn, get the resume boost, and move on to other places\n\n3 options:\n\n1. Take new job at Amazon with a 37% pay increase, half a downlevel, probably worse WLB but not awful, FAANG and my first tech company (I’ve only ever been in finance)\n\n2. Wait 4 months until I have my masters and over 3 YoE and then try for another job that doesn’t somewhat downlevel me\n\n3. Wait a year until I have my masters and closer to 4 YoE (maybe with a promotion) and enjoy life during the year traveling and taking advantage of good WLB and PTO\n\nAnyone have any advice on what to do if you were in my shoes?",

As a design engineer, I got offered 80k but I get to work hybrid, when I do have to go to the office it is an hour away.

The environmental engineering specialist role will pay 90k and it is not hybrid but they have every other Friday off, and the office is 30 minutes away. I am a bit worried that if I choose that position, it will limit me from moving up the ladder or moving up financially.

        "text": "I’m currently in a unique position at my job, (which has no responsibilities related to coding), to actually code and add value to the business. However I’m unsure of what specific coding contributions I should make that would be impactful enough to put on my resume before I begin applying for my first SWE job.\n\nI’m at a small apparel ecommerce company (10 person team) that does very well for its size. There’s no software dev team at my company as all our operations are done through platforms such as Amazon, Ebay, Shopify etc. so there’s no one I can learn from or work with.\n\nI have a CS degree and am well-versed in Python and familiar with C, Java, &amp; JS. I got my current job after graduation as an operations manager and have been here 3 years now. I’m now looking to pivot and land SWE role preferably focused on backend or fullstack development. I believe showing that I did some relevant coding at my current role can provide better odds of landing an interview/job.\n\nI’m the sole person in charge of operations which means I have lots of autonomy over the company’s channels. This entails editing the website however I want. (The owner doesn't care how things are done, so long as sales are growing.) I will mention that the website only brings in 1% of our annual sales. Third party channels like Amazon bring in way more but there’s little contribution I can do coding-wise there.\n\nThe website is Shopify based (default Dawn theme with lots of apps). I’m thinking of contributing code-wise to our website. Would simple things such as adding custom buttons to the home page and then wording it on my resume as \"Increased website conversions and homepage click-through rates by 40% through strategic implementation of stylized call to action buttons\" be worthwhile enough to include on a resume? (40% metric just used as an example of course). Should I work on contributions that go deeper such as \"Built internal private Shopify app to automatically write and optimize SEO titles and descriptions for newly loaded products\" etc.\n\nIs showcasing my skills by finding repetitive tasks and streamlining it with Python scripts and saying I saved my team *X* hours per week of work worthwhile?\n\nMy general concern is that these types of tasks are not strong or relevant enough towards showcasing my knowledge of system design, building APIs, web apps etc. All my personal projects demonstrate I can build full-stack projects, but I’m struggling to find something on the job to work on that will demonstrate the same thing. Should I not worry about this at all and just code up the things I mentioned above and slap it on the resume — assuming they positively impact the business?\n\nAm I missing something else that I could be programming to add value to the company? Would appreciate any ideas thanks.\n\nTLDR: Currently at a non-coding related job at an ecommerce company. Have the opportunity to write code to contribute to our frontend (Shopify based) and maybe creating scripts to streamline repetitive day-to-day tasks for my team. Concern is that these contributions may not be strong or relevant enough for my resume when my goal is to preferrably land a backend/fullstack focused SWE role. No tech or dev team to work with. I have full autonomy to contribute and do anything. Any ideas on what I can meaningfully contribute to pick up as experience and put on my resume before I begin applying to SWE roles?",

        "text": "I just graduated about a year back and currently work as an SWE at a small startup. One thing i noticed is that for a relatively heavy team of fifteen devs, we only have one BA and one PM. And i noticed that all the BA really does is talk to the client on our behalf, alongside the PM (but the PM works with the Tech lead and sets the direction himself) and assign us tickets while we (led by the Tech Lead) discuss the usability and feasibility of each ticket ourselves without her. We also don’t seem to have a Scrum Master although what i learnt about AGILE in school says each team should ideally have one. \n\nSome of my friends have jokingly (and some seriously) pointed out that BAs like the one at my job are just over-glorified admin staff that do the legwork for devs. Is that really true? One friend even dove into a huge rant about ‘useless’ middle management and blocking communication between clients and devs etc. \n\nI was actually quite interested in trying out a BA or PM role elsewhere but my limited understanding based off my current shop seems to hint at a mostly admin and communication-based role where honestly, it doesn’t even feel like a ‘tech’ role at all. What do y’all think? I might be tunnel visioned here so my apologies in advance.",

Last year I figured I’d try aiming for higher comp. Quit my job and studied for a few months and got an offer with a ~55% bump. \n\nI don’t necessarily subscribe to job-hopping every 1-2 years because I’m at the point where some projects simply take a long time and I think big project experience is pretty valuable. Not that I can’t get this experience elsewhere, but it’s “right here right now”.\n\nObviously though, job hopping is an extremely efficient way to up comp. \n\nI’m currently slowing down at work. I’d like to shift focus to other parts of life for a while after grinding to break into the field and grinding to climb the ladder a bit. I won’t slack off but I want to stop putting in OT, taking on additional responsibilities, or learning as much outside of work.\n\nWhich means I might see a plateau in comp if I stay put and just cruise. I may not, but I don’t think I’m talented enough to keep climbing without serious work.\n\nSo, I’m considering studying more LC and job hopping 2-3 times over the next 3-5 years, aiming to stay at the same/near same “level” but at higher caliber companies with higher comp.\n\nAnyway, just curious about people’s experience with many job hops in a short period of time.",
