        "text": "It is a dark day. Seven countries have left the council, and more than half of the remainder are in mass panic. The council report is in 14 days, and Xcom has suffered loss after loss. First, Alpha squad went up in smoke on a failed bomb difusal, pinned down by elite mutons. Next, Beta squadwiped when a Sectopod activated at the same time as an Ethereal. Delta found some success, but at the cost of major wounds to the entire squad. The Aliens seemingly couldn't be stopped. they slew Xcom operatives in droves, driving the organization to literally its last men. The barracks were empty, and the medical bay full. If there were a terror attack in the next 14 days, there wouldn't even be anyone to send to stop it.  The commander glances through their scheduled constructions- Five Hover SHIVs and weapons for each had been all they had been able to afford... hopefully the armor would last them through a mission or two to keep Xcom afloat, and allow Delta to come back from the medbay. There was just enough money left over to hire one soldier. She arrived 3 days later, a squaddie assault, and went into psi testing immediately. 7 days later, she exits the psi chamber, having successfully become a psion. 4 days remain before the council report, the end of humanity. Xcom has liquidized everything it could, and produced two more items in the interim. A suit of armor finished 3 days before the report, and an Alloy Cannon less than a day before the report. With 12 hours left on the clock, disaster- A terror attack begins in Boston. The commander considers sending the quad, but it won't help- nothing will defuse enough countries to save Xcom. The commander decides to wait out the end. 5 hours before the council report, the gollop chamber finishes construction- And the commander is informed the recent hire is powerful enough to use it.\n\nThere is no other option, no other choice. The end of humanity loomed mere hours away, but there was time for one last mission. One last shot. The Volunteer and Five Hover SHIVs boarded the Skyranger. They land on the Ethereal Temple Ship, and disembark. Soon, they meet resistance: the first of the Ethereal's subjects. Sectoids are little trouble for Hover SHIVs, and they are quickly slain. Cyberdisks proved dangerous enough to damage one of the machines, but it does not fall.  The thin men are next, slain like the cowards they are. Floaters arrive afterwards, permanently angry, but not skilled. Disaster strikes in the next room, a Muton Berserker rushes through the door and pummels the Volunteer, leaving her on a single hit point. The Volunteer lashes out with her mind, and takes control of the beast running it into the rest of the mutons, and beyond. SHIVs then become scouts as well as fighters, being the only things standing between the Volunteer and her end.  Finally, it seemed like it was over. The final room loomed. Only one challenge lay between the Volunteer and the Ethereals- two Sectopods. The SHIVs take up high positions and begin to lay waste to the machines, while the controlled berserker (now almost free) soaks up fire and attacks, destroying one of the Sectopods, the death throes of the machine claiming the monster's last breath as well. One SHIV is lost to the other Sectopod, leaving the Volunteer and her four.  The final room opens, and the Ethereals beckon the Volunteer. At long last, it is time. At long last, humanity has one final shot.\n\nThe battle begins, and the SHIVs take to the sky. Their plasma cannons rain down on the lead Ethereal, and the aliens return fire. The Volunteer, still on 1 hp, takes cover out of sight. The Uber Ethereal waves his hand, and in a single moment, humanity's chances plummet. He casts Rift, and all four SHIVs are torn from the sky, dropping to the floor in a pile of scrap. The Volunteer is the only one left. She activates her armor's chameleon circuits, one-time use mechanisms that temporarily turn the wearer invisible, and dashes for the leader. Even invisible, he turns to face her. She aims... and fires her shot.\n\nCritical Hit. Maximum Damage. The Ethereal falls. And with him, fall the aliens across the earth. The ships attacking Boston plummet from the sky. Earth is saved.\n\nShe has one confirmed kill. She is the savior of humanity.\n\nShe is The Volunteer. And there is one last thing she must do. The Temple Ship is falling apart, about to go critical and take Earth with it. With her last moments, the Volunteer takes control and lifts the ship into orbit, safe distance so that only rubble falls to the planet below. The Commander's parting shot has done it.",

        "text": "First a bit of backstory into the system we're using, it's a homebrew power system with a dice pool system as our dice mechanic. This is a slightly futuristic game (2030 ish) and we have supernatural powers, and guns. lots of guns. Anyway, onto the story.\n\n\nOur party has been tasked with retrieving some objects from a group of thieves and we have been given a tracker for said items. The tracker leads us to a warehouse which has a few guards around it. Our party has a history with stuff never going to plan when it comes to warehouses. But i was sure this couldn't end too badly. One of our party members has an ability that lets her basically go unnoticed, it's not invisibility but she could just walk by you without you noticing. Let's call her kay. \n\nSo Kay decides she wants to try and sneak past the guards and get inside the warehouse. Ok, our DM says, roll it. This is an enhanced sneak roll, and she fails. So our DM rolls the perception of the guards, Botch. A botch is the equivalent of a nat 1 in D&amp;D. When you roll more 1's than successes. So Kay has now managed to, from our POV, walk up to the door while the guards just look the other way.\n\nSlightly before this, our teleporter teleported himself on to the top off the warehouse, and was watching from the sky lights. It should be noted out teleporter's ability works off willpower, which he only has 3 out of a potential 10 of. So now we have our teleporter watching the main warehouse area, and Kay desides to sneak into the office area where the tracker is telling us the items we're looking for are. She manages to succeed all her stealth rolls and even a harder one to get into a room by opening the door without the man inside noticing. It was pretty impressive.\n\nNow Kay has managed to find the room the items we wanted where in, there is only a single man looking through some files at a desk. She can't grab the items and make them stealth with her unless she unstealths and restealths with her ability. So she decides to knock the man out. When glancing around for something she could use to knock him out, she finds a revolver sitting on the desk. After succeeding the stealth roll to take it off the desk, she proceeds to tell our DM. \"I hit him over the head with the butt of the revolver.\" Ok, roll it. Out of 3 d10 dice. She rolled 1, 1 and 2. That is a negative two botch. And by far the worst roll we have seen in the campaign so far. After a few minutes of laughter from the table as our DM attempts to figure out how a negative two botch should effect her, our DM finally says to us. \"As you strike his head with the pistol, there is an audible crack, followed by an extreme pain in your knee.\" \n\nShe has just managed to shoot herself in the knee. We have radio communication headsets, so now all our characters hear is screaming over the radio. Screams of pure agony. Loud enough to alert the entire warehouse, if the gunshot hadn't already. After a few minutes more of laughing out of game, our teleporter on the roof, hearing the screaming, decides to teleport down to try and get her out of there. I mentioned the willpower of 3 right? Well he also manages to botch. Only a negative 1, not as bad as Kay. But still a botch. Our DM is laughing along with the rest of the party at this string of bad luck, I mentioned we don't have a good history with warehouses right. After our DM calms down enough to tell us what happens next, our teleporter finds out he managed to cleanly split his foot. Like a clean ax has just chopped it down the middle. Luckily no one notices him as he manages to succeed his willpower check to stop himself from screaming in pain. At this point all the guards and people in the warehouse have gathered outside the office door Kay is in. She had locked the door behind her giving her about a minute before they downed the door. \n\nAt this point the rest of the party decides subtly is out the window and decides to clean up accordingly. The guards outside had rushed inside and neglected to lock the door behind them, allowing the rest of the party, 3 in total, to rush in. With all the enemys gathered outside the office door Kay is trapped in, the medic of the party can get to our teleporter and start stabilizing him lest he bleed out from his foot. Great, one issue down. Now to deal with everyone gathered outside the room Kay is trapped in.\n\nNow it's time for my character to finally do something. At this point i just wanted to end the encounter and get my teammates to medical help. My character has an ability to control electricity, but i normally can't throw out large lightning bolts or anything that would normally be helpful. But in the greatest roll i've made on my character to date, i managed to release a large electric bolt shocking everyone gathered outside the door in succession. Knocking them all out. \n\nSo now we break the door down that Kay was behind, and find her in a pool of blood with her knee fragmented. Calling the medic from the other part of the warehouse, we transport her and the teleporter to our vehicle, grab the items we came for, and hightail it to the nearest hospital. And that's where we left off that session. We have no idea if she will ever be able to walk again, there are supernatural healing abilities but we don't know the limits of those right now. And that's the second hectic warehouse adventure for our group, the last one involved convincing a mage he was high. I haven't shared it on this sub yet, but i might in future.",

        "text": "So, this is from my first time as a longtime GM, running a year-long campaign of Dungeon World. Dungeon World, for those who haven't played it before, is a rules-lite fantasy game with emphasis on story over combat. It's built around the core mechanic that you don't roll d20 for actions, you roll 2d6. A 6- is a fail, a 7-9 is a success at a cost, and a 10+ is a pure success. I only mention that because it's important to the story.\n\nOur setting was about a cold war between groups of sky pirate archaeologists, salvaging artifacts of an ancient, and long-dead race. The entire game was populated almost entirely by pirates, flying across the flying ruins with magically powered flying ships. It's basically a lazy conglomerate of all my favorite buzzwords for a campaign, but it worked really well. Early on, the players got themselves a sky ship, and was en route to a temple with an artifact they didn't want their enemies to get their hands on. They were intercepted on the way, and it the battle was 3 pirate battleships vs their shitty-ass flying coffin.\n\nI was 100% stacking the deck WAY against the players here, since they breezed through every other combat sequence before, and those fights had absolutely no tension at all. I may have taken it a *touch* too far, but cornered players find a way.\n\nThey decided to slam their ship into the enemy's. Terrible idea, but okay, they rolled an 8. They cause serious damage, but then were pinned in by the other two, making it so that they couldn't get their stern out of the enemy ship without slamming into the other ones, basically shredding their own ship in the process. We have the arena for the upcoming fight.\n\nThe players' ship is boarded, and the fight is on. The druid eats a few people alive, the fighter goes to town with her sword, but eventually, they start to get overwhelmed. Their ship is taking a beating from the direct cannon-fire at point-blank, and someone didn't tell the wizard to not throw fire on a wooden boat. Everything is going to shit REAL fast. GM panic mode starts a little as I freak out, horrified that I may have to bail them out, no matter how against the Dungeon World concept that shit is.\n\nLuckily, my players knew what to do. Like any good RPG player, they immediately started to go through their character sheets, looking for literally *anything* that could save them. Then the Wizard speaks up.\n\nTurns out the move for Ritual is incredibly poorly worded, and doesn't make any fucking sense at all to anyone who hasn't played the game a few times before. The Wizard realizes that, and we don't have video chat on, but he is *audibly* smiling when he says \"Guys, I have a plan, but I'm gonna need some time. Ironspark-Syris, I'm gonna use Ritual to make my amulet into an Amulet of Flight.\"\n\nSo, the party buys him time. They fight, tooth and nail for as long as they possibly can. The party is close to death, and the druid has basically desperately started shifting into random animals to see what would work. I could start to lean off, but I decide the Wizard has a plan, and I think he might pull out some serious deus ex machina right here. I think the Fighter gets down to 1 health at a point. After I can't take it any longer, and feel awful for these poor players, I go back to the Wizard.\n\nMe: \"Alright, give me the roll for Ritual.\"\nWizard rolls. A 7. A partial success, or a success at a cost. All the players on the call audibly whimper and cuss profusely, but, to everyone's confusion, the Wizard cheers. He's ecstatic. Cue the rest of us being absolutely confused.\nMe, having absolutely 0 idea how Ritual actually works, and thinking that the player chooses the penalties on fail instead of the GM: \"Alright, pick 2 penalties.\"\n\n\"Well, it already took a long amount of time, so that one, and,\" he's audibly trying to stop from laughing, \"*It disenchants every magical item in the area.*\"\n\nThe chat grows completely silent as we all realize what he just did. He just disenchanted every single magical item in the area. Including the artifacts powering the airships. He intentionally made a risky and stupid move, knowing he'd probably fail the roll in order to destroy 3 battleships in a single move. They managed to keep their own ship up with some quick thinking, but at that point, it didn't really matter anymore. They'd already won. With a single mediocre roll.\n\nI have run tons of games since, using a huge variety of systems, but in every single game, I have *never* had a player count on failure like that, and I highly doubt I will again.",

        "text": "Our regular weekly game is having a little bit of restart trouble at the beginning of the new year with one of our regulars being laid up with a serious flu. So I jumped in last night with a one-shot and it wound up going completely off the rails in the most hilarious way possible. And being a generous soul, I'm here to share.\n\nThe setting was a mostly undefined aetherscape, with the flying ships and islands, seas of clouds etc.\nThe players were the skipper of a small ship The Golden Duckling, the ship's cook, who's cookery belongs on the list of things banned by the Genevan convention and a dirty duelist, no not in need of a shower, but in need of a working moral compass.\n\nThese three are at the Black Spire, a port where imperial law isn't really enforced, where freebooters, pirates and other miscreants can come to put up their feet and spend their ill-gotten booty. Which they have been doing quite amiably.  \nAnd as a result of this they're quite surprised when the governor's men suddenly burst from a side street calling them by their non de plume of \"There they are! Get them!\"\n\nOf course rather then staying to get shot and stabbed by a dozen men the crew throw down an improvised molotov cocktail and run for their ship, quickly making ready and casting off, barely noticing the crewmember telling them that their customer's just come on board.  \nAgain, surprise since they've not been talking to potential customers. Confusion all around while they speed away from the Black Spire.\n\nIn the captain's quarters they find, seated at the captains desk a beautiful young lady wearing a blue dress hands bound and her mouth gagged, and in the corner Captain Voltaire, their long-standing rival, wearing a shit-eating grin.  \nHe of course tells them not to make good on their threats to keelhaul him without a rope because the governor believes that they, or rather an agent in their employ kidnapped his daughter, and they need him to clear their name.\n\nThe young lady Esmeralda is untied and quickly confirms Voltaire's story, how this brave and dashing rogue rescued her from the clutches of her father and the evil counselor who's been feeding poison in to his ear. She's sure that this advisor has somehow addled her dear daddy's mind, because her father decided to betrothed her to this vile man. And she doesn't want to be married yet!  \nTogether with Voltaire they tell them that shortly after this new advisor gained her father's ship (The Azure Dagger) started making regular trips to the Sea of Storms, a treacherous region of the aetherscape, where howling winds and aetheric currents can tear even the mightiest ships to splinters. Only the unbelievably brave, or the suicidally stupid venture in to the sea of storms.  \nSo naturally, the PC's resolve to go. To trail the Azure Dagger the next time it passes by on it's way to the Sea of Storms.\n\nSo they hide in a cloudbank and wait...  \nUnfortunately the captain couldn't find sneaky if you glued it to his hands and blows the chase, the Azure Dagger notices the pursuit and deploys it's full sails, easily outrunning the much smaller Golden Duckling. But never fear, the Captain boldy presses on and dives in to the Sea of storms, and promptly crashes the ship on a small rock of an island. The ship is badly damaged and the crew will need a few days to repair the webbing to a point where they can try to escape the Sea of Storms.\n\nThey're in luck though, the cook finds some purple glowing mushrooms to make in to dinner, as well as the giant eggs of the giant Aether serpent, a creature that grows so large it an inhale the mightiest frigates without noticing.  \nIn addition, they spot the lights of the Azure Dagger in the distance, apparently the ship is moored to a different island not too far from where they are!  \nThe eggs are wisely left alone (for now) and the mushrooms are turned in to what should have been soup but instead behaves more like gelatin. One of the players slips me a fate token to turn the mushrooms in to some kind of drug.  \nAnd this is where things went, strange...\nThe players and crew eat the shrooms, upon which I offer fate points to the lot of them saying \"Big Lipped Alligator Moment!\" (from all dogs go to heaven?)  They basically all get to enjoy a trip with singing alligators with trapeze act.\n\nDuring this BLAM Voltaire steals the skiff and, taking Esmeralda as a hostage heads towards the Azure dagger. The foul fiend! Curse his sudden but inevitable betrayal!  \nThe Captain manages to sling himself on to the skiff, but faced with the hostage situation he is forced to steer the skiff to the Azure Dagger and go on board to find out how the drug is made.  \nMeanwhile the cook and the dirty duelist head back to where they found the giant aether eel eggs, slice them open and ride hatchlings to the Azure Dagger and now it's time for everyone to buckle their swash as a marvellous fight breaks out.\n\nThe cook steers his eel in to the skiff, which crushes it in one gulp, Voltaire just managing to escape on to the deck of the Azure Dagger, bringing Esmeralda with him where he squares off against the cook, the duelist slips in through one of the gun ports and starts looking for the devious advisor, cutting down crewmembers as he moves along, and the captain reaches the hold where he comes face to face with the captain Boris of the Azure Dagger and the advisor in some kind of makeshift alchemy lab.  \nCue the war of the moustaches! The captain, having earlier remembered that Boris has a thing for moustaches, brandishes his in the most intimidating way possible, striking a pose with his french goatee and perfectly manicured whiskers, and likewise Boris brandishes his naturally curling jet-black handlebar moustache.\n\nOn the upper deck the Duelist joins the fray with Voltaire and the Cook, but oh no! This duelist turns out to be extra dirty! He becomes a turncoat when Voltaire offers to split the profit with him 50/50! This leaves the cook dangerously outnumbered!  \nBelow in the hold things take a turn for the worse, the Captain and Boris start to exchange blows, and it turns out that not only does Boris have a wonderful handlebar moustache, he also has quite a good handle on swordplay. So the captain flips over the table, and by sheer accident (and earning a fate point) creates a kind of super-rogaine, both his and Boris' moustache grow out of control filling the entire room with hair! everyone inside is pinned down!\n\nThings were coming to a close at this point, the captain starts to make peace (and more) with Boris, by braiding both their beards, such a romantic gesture. In the end he manages to seduce Boris, so he can be convinced to take them back and expose the advisor's evil ploy.\nOn deck, the cook realizes that he is outclassed, but it's not in his nature to flee so he does the next best thing, get revenge by throwing a monkey wrench in Voltaire's plans, by throwing Esmeralda overboard! Fortunately Esmeralda wakes up on time and runs away, and the cook, having rather stubby legs can't catch up and winds up chasing her up and down the ship accompanied by the yakkety sax tune.\n\nThe day was saved and everyone had a big laugh!",

        "text": "So, a new campaign has started up for my college group. We’re playing in the Dresden Files system, which I’ve run before. For those of you not familiar with it, it's a fudge-dice based system set in a modern-day fantasy setting. So, let’s roll onto the cast.\n\nHoss Delgado- Biker from Hell (Michigan): My character. A minor talent who has a demonically possessed motorcycle. Often acts as a courier in Seattle and the occasional rough and tumble biker with a heart of gold. Knows very, VERY little of the super natural.\n\nJackson- Basic Bad-ass: A character from the Dresden Campaign I ran a few years ago. An ex-soldier who runs a butcher's shop called Monster Meats. He's come to Seattle to find a one of the party members from the previous campaign to get his Hell Hound Corgi back and find the coin of a Fallen Angel. \n\nDarren Skinner- Newly Appointed Warden of the White Council. Another character from the previous campaign. Originally a normal run of the mill wizard who managed to rise to the position of being one of the Wardens of the White Council. He's been posted in Seattle to watch over the area. He lives with his little sister who has developed magic and is training her.\n\nDismas- Descendant of Fafnir: A mercenary who works for Monoc Security. A dragon scion who has the blood of Fafnir running through him. Built like a bunker and hits like a truck. Currently in Seattle on vacation from merc work.\n\nSo, without further ado, our story shall begin.\n\nIt opens to the bright and brilliant Spring morning in Seattle. I was tearing rubber down the highways in the wilderness, Jackson’s tending to his shop, Darren is going shopping and Dismas is just waking up. As the days draw on eventually Darren and I head to the local Paranet Meeting. We learn that nothing has been happening as of late around Seattle besides a few rumors of a Cat-like-goblin terrorizing yards. With that the meeting is dismissed and everyone breaks up into individual groups.\nA terrified hedge witch approaches Darren with a request. She says that that her boyfriend and some of his friends went to the Ravensdale Ridge to go spelunking. As it would turn out they ended up vanishing for quite some time.  She asks if she can go and find her missing boyfriend and his friends. Once he has what he needs he approaches me and we talk out what’s happening. I grab a delivery for warding supplies that’s head to Ravensdale and we go to talk to both Jackson and Dismas, asking for their help because of the suspicion that something was going to rear its head.\n\nGathering up in the morning the party arrivies at the Valk-rize Hotel, where Dismas lives and is maintained by Valkyries, as their launch point, we could only watch as Jackson tried, and failed, to flirt with the head chef of the hotel. He has a contract to deliver meats to them and it goes well as you think it would. With the awkward, and potentially lethal, encounter out of the way we all gather up our stuff and prepare to head off to Ravensdale and whatever lays there.\n\nAfter a few hours of travel, we finally arrive in Ravensdale. Darren looks around the area for any weird magic mojojo. He can pick up traces of dark, twisted magics that linger around the city. We head off to my delivery point and… The most interesting person I’ve delivered to has reared his head.\n\nWe arrive at a run-down rickety house at the edge of town. With the package under my arm I approach the door. Knocking upon it I hear nothing. So, for good measure, I knock on the door once more. Next thing I know I hear shouts of “I’m coming! I’m coming” from behind the door and footsteps against stairs. Opening the door was an old man, wearing nothing but a dirty green bathrobe and smelling of a mixture of unwashed and old people smell. We’ll call him Old Hedge Mage (who is probably senile) or OHM for short.\nOHM: “Who are you?!”\nMe: “I’m a courier. I have your delivery.”\nOHM: “What delivery? I ordered no delivery!”\nMe: “I have a package of warding supplies that are to be delivered to this address.”\nOHM: “Of what?”\nMe: “Warding supplies.”\nOHM: “Oh that. Come in. Come in!”\n\nAnd with that I step into his abode. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHopefully I’ll get part 2 of the story up soon if college doesn’t suddenly come crashing down on me!\n\n",

        "text": "This is a story that I am both proud of, and not so proud of. It was fun, but in hindsight 12 years later, it is pretty cringy in some ways, but we were all young adults fresh out of highschool. Just some less mature than others.\n\nThe DM of this story is also who's house we played at. Periodically either him or myself would run games. His often began with a futile attempt to run Return to the Temple of Elemental Evil, if only because that was the only module he had. Often these games would divert very quickly, either into their own plots, or the other players would lose interest.\n\nIn this attempt, I had decided to use Libris Mortis, the undead supplement, specifically going for the True Necromancer prestige class. Largely the rest of the party's makeup has left my mind after a dozen years, but it largely irrelevant. We were a bunch of sellswords with more than questionable ethics.\n\nThe derailing began as soon as we arrived at the Moat House/Keep early in the module. There, a blue dragon guarded it but some quick talking managed to secure a \"deal.\" If we continuously pay off the dragon, it'll let us exist around it. With this in mind, we proceeded to plunder the dungeon.\n\nThe DM decided to use random loot, because why the hell not? He would come to regret this as one of our party members, a nice guy but stubborn as a wall and about as wise, found a Lamp. With a 3-wish genie. All done via random loot tables. Everyone is now on alert because our long sordid history with Wishes told us these things *never* go well, because everyone who's gotten their hands on Wishes ends up making dumb ones. The first wish was simple: kill off all the monsters lurking in the dark depths below. Sure, whatever. Then the player began to hem and haw. He wanted to get rid of the dragon (never occurring to him to wish it dead), trying to figure out how to pay it off permanently. Slowly, he sounded out his wish, much to my rising horror with each word. \"I wish for all the treasure... not owned by anyone *alive*.\"\n\nDread now settled heavily in my chest, the DM grinned and complied, showering the player with a room full of untold riches, while the player grinned to himself on just how smart he was. Amongst the treasure? The Rod of Orcus, because at this time the demon prince is Undead. I weighed the situation, knowing there is no way in hell the player is going to rescind his genius wish with any amount of arguing. And so, I became That Guy. Using a surprise round, I was able to dispatch him with spell and class feature.\n\nAlso, I am sure this is the only time the Death Domain power has ever actually successfully killed someone, but I was low on options as I wasn't exactly a power character. Yet.\n\nThe player took it well enough, especially after I immediately took the lamp and used the last wish to undo the previous one and emphasis amnesia of the incident to the owners of the treasure. It didn't help that this player has a history of getting himself killed, PK and otherwise, with his own dumb decisions.\n\nWe leveled quickly after that, the DM being kind and giving us all the experience points we otherwise would've missed out on due to the Lamp. Sometime later I would return after missing a session to find out that our resident Sorcerer, a different player, had died to a Quasit. A level 10+ spell caster losing to a challenge rating 2 monster. Via defenestration. Just another day at the office for me, really.\n\nI did, however, smell an opportunity. The group's sorcerer was... one of Those Guys himself, the kind who gets bored if he's not murdering, and will find whatever he can to alleviate his boredom regardless of who it was.The kind of guy that needs to be guided to not be a nuisance. The kind of guy who would gladly sign on the dotted line and not read the fine print if you dangle a shiny monster statblock in front of him. The kind of guy who agrees to let the Necromancer revive him as a Mummy.\n\nAt around this point the game takes a shift in focus and we start playing essentially Overlord with me as the Overlord. Being the Lawful Evil bitch I could be, I proceeded to create a small town around my keep, and foster good will in the populace through basic upgrades to their living conditions. I even gave them dental. The rest of the party was mostly bored by this, a hazardous thing with this group, but enjoyed spiffy titles of meaningless authority. The DM and I were able to placate them with adventures to get more loot, and dangling new shiny prizes in front of them. A sacrifice and create undead there (one that got me a Wish for limitless undead control), a few grafts there. All without reading the fine print. One player though had no interest, so I had a necrotic cyst placed in them as an insurance policy, though they were the least problematic of the group.\n\nInevitably, all good things must come to an end. The party eventually started to get restless and tried to stage a rebellion after they realized I was a super powerful dictator. At which point I sadly informed them that their free will was but a gift I could take away. It was only *then*, months later that they realize the repercussions of letting a Necromancer revive them as undead. A show of source material and a Rebuke attempt later, and the grafted PCs were now under my sway. The last guy asked what I had done to him, and I just showed him all the spells I could now cast on him via the Cyst, DM confirming the secret rolls.\n\nObviously the game fell apart shortly after that, but to be fair it was on its way out to begin with as the DM was running out of ideas. There is a weird sense of pride and shame I have for that game. Shame in basically screwing over my rather problematic party members, but also Pride in how *thorough* I was and how it all fell into place. Since then, I've been wanting to do more Evil Overlord games just... with less utter backstabbing like that. Also, I'm sorry for how long this ended up being.",

        "text": "Four days travel south of the mainland sits an island called Jarenthal. Although balmy in climate, this is no average tropical island, nearly one hundred percent of the island is filled with taverns, inns, brothels, pubs and guildhouses, forming the city the island is named for. Jarenthal is the favourite stomping ground of mercenaries, pirates, heroes and adventurer's of the region. Three of of those adventurer's were trying to relax in a tavern known as The Moonstone Mask where our story begins.\n\nViarwyn Othwiddle was a half-elf bard. Who was just as likely to be a hired entertainer at the Moonstone Mask as he was to be a patron, although on this night he was acting as the latter. He was overlooking the haul from a recent adventure, a potion whose label hinted had the ability to shrink the imbiber, and a rather silly-looking bath cap that provided air underwater, along with the ease of movement underwater that would make even Tritus, god of the sea, envious.\n\nThe next seat over at the bar from Viarwyn was Vorgek Skullmender, a tusked gray half-orc capable of performing great miracles in the name of the orcish god Gruush, even if he served the his terrible lord begrudgingly. Although religious, it wouldn't be accurate to describe Vorgek as a man of the cloth. Towering above nearly every other drinker in the bar, and covered in incredibly heavy plate metal armour. On the floor beside him was an enormous cloth rucksack. The contents of which were quite mysterious, and the subject of regular gossip among the serving staff of The Moonstone Mask, one of whom claims to have seen Vorgek whispering into the bag from time to time. In a much smaller bag sits a potion of climbing, and a small jug of alchemy, a magical jug that allows him to pour nearly unlimited amounts of liquid out of it, and which he uses to top up his ale when he thinks the servers aren't looking.\n\nIf Vorgek is big the last adventurer is a giant. Gad Tengo, a tortle monk weighs in at just over five hundred pounds, although most of that is in his enormous shell. The shell which, besides a small rucksack, is the only thing resembling clothing on Gad's body. Schooled in the art of the drunken fist, Gad feels at home downing drink after drink. In his small rucksack is a potion with a crude drawing on the outer glass, that seems to imply, to Gad at least, that it will make the drinker grow in size, as well as a magical hat in which he can remove a small furry animal or rodent. Sometimes good for a free drink in the more podunk of villages.\n\n**Chapter 1**\n\nThe three adventurer's downtime was interrupted when shouts of terror started to explode in pockets around the city. The magical, transparent roof of The Moonstone Mask provided clear view as to the source of the panic. A tower, perched on a cloud above the city seemed to be falling out of the sky. The tower was easily two hundred feet tall, and was very decrepit in appearance, entire floors worth of walls were missing, but somehow the stories above stood steady. Well, as steady as they could while falling out of the sky. It is not everyday giant towers fall out of the air, so the adventurer's, and other drunken inhabitants of Jarenthal could be forgiven for not noticing that the tower was not falling quite as fast as one would expect. \n\nAt that moment, an older man with long silvery hair and a youthful energy his age entered The Moonstone Mask, walking right up to the three adventurers.\n\n\"Why hello there. How are you? Pleased I'm sure. I'm Drake Argent. I have a mission for you, very sorry I forgot, I seem to have misplaced it,\" the man introduced as Drake Argent fumbled through the many interior pockets of his luxurious gray coat. \"A ha!\" he exclaimed as he pulled out a small box, opening it in front of the three adventurers. A magical energy seeped out, green tendrils finding their way to the foreheads of the three surprised men. The magic attempted to charm the trio into cooperation, but Viarwyn's elven heritage, and Gad's years of mental training helped them to resist the magic. Vorgek was not so lucky.\n\n\"Hmm. That didn't seem to be as effective as I was hoping. Oh well, I got the orc I guess. He's the most bull-headed of the three of you I suspect anyway. I apologize for trying to force you to help me. But as you see there is a tower falling onto the city, and being an island there isn't much room to evacuate, and I, well I just couldn't waste time trying to convince you. I've divined that you're the three to help me stop the tower, and boy have I been chasing this tower, for years, anyway I've divined that you're going to help me, so I guess you are, spell or no spell.\"\n\n\"What about payment or reward?\" said Vorgek, apparently magical coercion not being enough to prevent him from trying to make a coin or two. \n\n\"Yes, yes, I've got money. A thousand gold coins each will do?\", Drake Argent paused to see the excitement instantly flash across the three faces of the adventurers. \"I see, yes a thousand will do. Well we have to get up to that tower then. Not a minute to spare.\" The elderly man popped the magical box into one of his many interior jacket pockets, while pulling out dozens of silver and glass widgets out of others. Muttering to himself, he screwed the many pieces together, until a large silvery telescope was set up before them, pointed up at the tower in the sky.\n\n\"Alright then, who's first?\" The trio all hesitated, \"You, half-elf, have a go will you?\" Drake said, as he pushed the Viarwyn's head down towards the eyepiece. Just as the tower came into focus for the bard, he felt a strange pulling sensation, beginning somehow both in his teeth and his toenails, before spreading throughout the rest of his body, pulling him both inwards and upwards. Opening his eyes he didn't realize that he had closed, he found himself standing on a sturdy, if spongy, cloud, facing the tower.\n\nSeeing that there was no real way out of this, Gad leaned in next. The same strange sensations overcoming him until he opened his eyes on the cloud at the foot of the tower. Vorgek the half-orc briefly toyed with the idea of destroying the telescope, but convinced himself not to, or at least it felt like he convinced himself not to, the magic had taken ahold of him after all and there was no way to be certain. He looked into the eyepiece, and like the others, found himself before the tower. \n\nNot one moment had passed after Vorgek appeared, when Drake Argent appeared behind him, calmly unscrewing the last of the bronze pieces of the telescope and returning it to his pocket.\n\n\"Well, let's get control of this tower then.\"",

The interesting thing about Tirkosu is that it's constantly evolving, creating new places to explore and introducing new creatures as the planes elemental planes feed into the island. But despite this constant state of flux you could always rely on the basic outline. The southwest was nice and foresty, the east was barren and dusty, the center was filled with rolling planes.\n\nThat had all changed once Tiamat's shadow tipped the balance.\n\nIt took a long time for the islanders to get used to their new environments. Moving village wasn't an affordable option for most people, so they had to make do and try to adapt. I remember the Gnomes had it particularly hard. They were used to sunny skies and warm beaches, which were now all frozen over. They managed to keep their homes warm by creating a wall around Little Orthraze, composed of giant metal pipes though which ran boiling water, kind of like a giant central heating system.\n\nCosapai was now in the same state as Orthraze; a chaotic jumble of rubble and shadow. Mirlings made the place uninhabitable, so the refugees turned to Rahm Oru as their new settling ground. Vanella, Elo, Pekeski, and the Danger Duo spent much of their time securing it as the new capital of the island. \n\nThey also got embroiled in the elections; I'd decided to run one of the few third-tier Adventurers League modules, namely PHLAN 1-3 Subterfuge. The group were called over to a one of the candidates' house to discuss a matter of grave importance. At least, that was what the letter said. When they arrived he revealed to them that the urgent problem, the dilemma he'd called on the Tsethem to fix, was that a delivery of stone hadn't arrived from Sovu Vapohu. \n\nA delivery of stone. \n\nThe Tsethem had been called out for a delivery of stone. \n\n~~Thane~~ Vanella (I seriously have to stop calling her that) calmly but firmly explained that they weren't interested in being messenger boys for a snooty noble. They did things like, savin' the world an' shad. The politician tried to backpedal, but he went about it the wrong way by basically threatening their existence as a group. They left after a few choice words from V'nell. \n\nThen they discovered a parade for them had been organized outside, and they realized the truth. The noble wasn't interested in the rocks, he was interested in the Tsethem. And the support they could provide his campaign. They left the parade in disgust. I never got to play through the rest of the adventure. \n\n* * *\n\nThe following year was quite significant in terms of technological progress. While tracking a vampire in the catacombs below Rahm Oru, V'nell discovered an ancient Dwarven model of an iron golem. She tinkered about with it and soon managed to create her own. While not as intelligent or dexterous as Warforged, the golems were very handy at manual labor. It soon became not unusual among the richer folk to see a metal man doing the heavy lifting for its weaker masters. \n\nThis was the point where I decided to do the first big timeskip. So far I'd kept it to roughly one adventure per year. Now that Tiamat was defeated it felt like the island could use a little reprieve. Some time to heal, and time to get used to its new structure. \n\nSo time marched on. \n\n* * *\n\nTwenty three years after the fall of Orthraze. \n\nThe island had been thriving in the fourteen years since the Bloodless War. Villages had been repaired, deaths had been mourned, and the army of Tiseo clones had been wiped out. Rahm Oru was bustling with innovation and commerce, very reminiscent of Orthraze's golden age. Guilds had sprung up, the most influential of which was the Brotherhood of Arcane Tinkerers (BAT for short). They were the spearhead of the the technological revolution. \n\nPeace reigned, and the island flourished under it. There were no world-ending threats looming on the horizon. The age of Tsethem was over. \n\nAnd it was new character time. I'd been playing pretty huge groups for a long while now. I wanted to dial it back and focus on a single character for a bit. The Mystic Unearthed Arcana had recently been given a revamp, so I was itching to try out all the new feature. \n\nI created Codix, a young man trying to discover himself. Meaning, he literally didn't know who he was. Amnesia was a theme I thought I'd already explored with Vanella, until I realized that was a combination of denial and mind-tamering. Codix's main goal was figuring out why he'd woken up face down on the muddy road to Rahg Krahv. And why he could read people's thoughts. \n\nCody had messy black hair, dressed all in black, and had stary eyes. If I'd have given him any other personality than \"quiet, watchful, and thoughtful\" I'm sure he would have turned into a dark and edgy character. But thankfully he felt natural to play, and I had a fun time playing a few small fetch quests as him in preparation for whenever main story. \n\nThe main story that would have to wait, because the virtual DM decided to kill him off. \n\nGritting my teeth, I set about creating another mystic. You know that trope in tabletop RPGs where Bill the Barbarian gets killed off, only to have Bill's identical twin rush up, loot Bill 1's corpse, and join the rest of the party without them batting an eyelid? I'm guilty of that this time, unfortunately. At least, I was at first. \n\nVikina Lightstep Enakilamaru was a Golath by birth but a Rahm Oruan by nature. Her father had been given away as a baby for being too sickly, but he grew strong under the care of his foster parents. He set up a brewery just outside Rahm Oru, and eventually married a wandering Golath woman. She gave birth to Viki, then did a bunk. I was laughing/crying at the time because my own mother decided to abandon us, and between this and Vanella's \"family\" issues it was like the vDM was trying to hit all the sore spots. \n\nShe was visually quite similar to Codix, with dark clothing and pale complexion, which is where the fable of Bill the Barbarian comes in. But although she shared many mechanical similarities in her class, the joy of the Mystic is the customisation it allows. Whereas Cody had been all about mind control and telekinesis, Viki focused more on strength enhancements. Mind over matter, so to speak. \n\nWhat made Viki fun to play was that she had always been a bit... Batty. There wasn't anything wrong with her brain per-sé, but she simply didn't take anything seriously. It was almost impossible to have a proper conversation with her, as the tangents she'd go off on and the be deliberate misinterpretations would send the talk running in circles. It was incredibly frustrating for anyone trying to get something out of her, but it was absolutely hilarious to watch. \n\nThis kind of behavior had only properly emerged within the last few years. I was interested to see where it led. \n\nSo naturally, the vDM killed her off also. \n\nTo say I was annoyed would be an understatement. I'd lost countless level 1s by this point, some of which I'd been really keen of playing. But this was different. Rolling up a Mystic took time and effort, you couldn't just knock one out in half an hour like any other class. I was about to resign myself to scouring the Psychic Discipline list once more, when an idea struck me. \n\nCody and Viki had been very similar. They'd have been fun to play together, in fact. Maybe, just maybe, the vDM would allow them to live. Maybe they could go on a trippy journey through the afterlife, on a quest to get back or something. \n\nI asked the virtual DM a direct question. Fifty-fifty chance. Would he allow them to continue together?\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n* * *\n\nViki woke up on an asteroid, floating in a starry sky. The astral plane. Cody sat a little way off, watching her owlishly. She grinned a cheeky, slightly zany grin. He gave a small smile back. \n\n\"Hey.\"\n\n\"Wolleh.\"\n\n\"I'm Codix.\"\n\n\"I'm Viki. Or Vikina Lightstep Enakilamaru for short.\" \n\n\"You were asleep for a while.\"\n\n\"Yes. I do that.\"\n\n\"Did you... Die? Like me?\"\n\n*pause*\n\n\"Yes.\" \n\n\"Huh.\"\n\n* * *\n\nSo how did they kick off their joint adventures? By spending the next *year* punching through the asteroid. They could sense something magical inside it, and judged that to be the reason for their miraculous teleportation. As insane as it seemed, it was the most sensible thing to do; the astral plane is huge, and there was no garuantee that they'd find their own plane again. \n\nTime is as warped as space in the astral plane. The year they spent together seemed like mere days. Viki did most of the work, because Cody wasn't built to pack a punch. She'd smash her fists into the rock until they bled, then rested and healed up before trying again.\n\nAs they dug, they talked. They talked about their lives, where they'd come from and what they hoped to do. Cody wanted to find his place in the world. Viki wanted to become a vigilante. They figured that something must have happened to them in the past couple of years; Viki had also experienced a short spurt of memory loss, but it was more of a blank spot instead of amnesia. \n\nEventually they broke through to the core. A pulsating mass of purple liquid hovered in the middle where the gravity converged. Taking a deep breath, they held each other's hands and reached out simultaneously to touch the swirling orb. \n\n* * *\n\nThey emerged into chaos. They were still in the astral plane, but the constellations were different. Clutter swirled around them in the form of cogs, rope, barrels, chests of draws, and Warforged husks. They had no clue what was going on, but I did. \n\nThis was an outpost that Marianne Sterling had set up, to use as a base of operations while searching for Michael Thane. For whatever reason the purple liquid had also been contained within the base, which had now switched places with the two mystics, probably destroying the asteroid in the process. The teleporting liquid hadn't taken the base's contents however, which was what they were now floating through. \n\nThey pulled themselves through the clutter and were lucky enough to discover an inactive planar gateway. Codix was able to activate it with a little fiddling and they stepped through the rift, leaving behind the debris. They didn't even notice the shattered crystalline cylinder lying at the center of a mess of pipes and tubes. \n\nI did. I knew what it signified. Sterling was highly intelligent, she wouldn't just run into battle against the Warforged if there was a chance she could die. I'd had my suspicions, but this confirmed it:\n\nMarianne's *Clone* was alive, and there was no doubt she was looking for revenge. \n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\nAs a reminder, because I've had a couple of comments about how this is \"just a novel\"; I'm not writing this out as a cool story, or even putting it down as it happens. I'm putting onto paper events that happened a little less than a year ago, with the intent to prove that solo D&amp;D doesn't just allow for a great story: it allows for a great game. ",

The neighboring evil biome has only sent moderately concerning amounts of blood rain recently. Until a human zombie, armed and armored, crosses the threshold of the biome, into the dwarves domain. The guard is on alert, but the zombie makes no move to attack. In fact, a civilian walks by it, and isn't even afraid of the creature. The zombie continues its wandering, and is quickly forgotten as a kobold thief is found and slain by the guards. The zombie however, is still around. It wanders its way through the map, unknown to the overseer.\n\nA month later, a siege arrives. Goblins, bloodthirsty and ready for war, have arrived at the gates. The dwarves ready a defense, but the goblins reach a complication: The Human. The undead soldier had still been wandering the surface, eventually finding his way over to where the siege had started, and he fought the goblins with more strength than a living man should ever have. The goblin chief fell under his axe, and the main force started to retreat into the evil biome to the south of the fortress.\n\nDirectly into the rest of the zombies milling about. The force was routed within seconds of reaching the main group, as goblins met undead men. Only two goblins managed to make it off the map- with the force of human undead not having lost a single member. The undead force left to chase the goblins, leaving the dwarves, who hadn't even seen a single second of combat, extremely confused. A month later, one zombie wanders back into the map. It is the same human zombie that originally started this tale. And he climbs to the top of a hill, and waits. He is now named The Iron Shield by the Dwarves. The Iron Shield stares into the distance in the direction the goblins fled, as if knowing they would eventually return.",

        "text": "Some Storm King's Thunder spoilers ahead!\n\n______________________\n\nSo here's a little setup to how we got here.  \n\nParty arrives at Nightstone, finds goblins, kills goblins. Shortly after some Zhentarim mercenaries arrive. Party has 3  PCs that chose Zhentarim faction. Easily hand over town to mercs, and disperse a small horde of orcs while they're at it. Proceed to goblin cave to rescue villagers. Kill every monster in cave except one goblin. Say \"Congratulations you're now the boss of a bunch of non-combatant goblins.  We expect an army when we return.\" Party returns villagers, leave Zhentarim in charge and continue on their campaign. \n\nFast forward 2 months in game, and through a fair bit of the campaign and the party decides to return to Nightstone to check up on things. Behind the scenes I've done some research over goblin life cycles and breeding rates and have decided to roll a d10 every month for how many new goblins they get plus a d4 some random other monsters. The gods smiled upon them and they now have an army of 20 goblins and 3 orcs. \n\nMeanwhile in Nightstone, their friends the Zhentarim have been quite productive and prosperous and have turned the town into a nice base for themselves, the leader of the original band even styling himself Lord Xolkin. They've turned the town into a base for their mercenary operations as well as began felling and exporting lumber from the nearby forest. Off the top of my head I told the party the town had ~50 mercs and ~50 assorted laborers. \n\nUnfortunately for the Zhentarim and Lord Xolkin, the elves of the nearby forest take exception to the logging operations and consider it a breach of the contract they had with the previous ruler of Nightstone. As such, they've began attacking anyone that enters the forest.\n\nEnter the party. Party arrives at Nightstone first to a heroes alone from Xolkin. However as people tend to do with adventurers, he asks them to help solve his little dispute with the Elves. So the next morning the party sets out to try and find the elves.\n______________________\n\nHere's where I should probably give a bit of a description of the party: \n\nA Tiefling Warlock. Zhentarim faction\nA Genasi Sorceress. Zhentarim\nA Wood Elf Shadow Monk. Zhentarim\nA Human Fighter. Harpers\nA Half-elf Sorcerer. Harpers \nA Goliath Barbariam. Emerald Enclave.\n\n\nSo if you don't know Zhemtarim are essentially a criminal syndicate. They've got some legitimate operations, but those are usually fronts for more illicit activities. \n\nThe Emerald Enclave are a bunch of tree huggers. Baasically Druids without having to actually be  a druid.\n\nHarpers don't matter for this story.\n_________________________\n\nSo traipsing through the woods looking for elves, they soon find them. Or are found by them... \n\nAs of yet the party is still a mixture of alignments and there's still the hope of solving the situation of the elves diplomatically. The Nature Barbarian takes the lead in the discussion, with the help of his elvish friends as translators. Eventually he gets the elves to agree to a parlay, the following evening, at the woods edge with the Zhentarim Leader, Lord Xolkin.\n\nBack at the keep the party get Xolkin to agree to the parlay, though it's clear that he doesn't think much will come of it. He also doesn't trust the elves and intends to take half his troops with him as insurance. \n\nHere's where the parties motivations start to get murky. My players legitimately argued for 2 hours over the plan for this meeting. It was awesome. \nI think the final intent was to betray Xolkin in the meeting. Use the elves to weaken his troops. At which point they would either kill or turn any survivors to their side. The ultimate goal being to clear the town of humans, and establish it as the base for their future monster army.  Alignments be damned at this point really. \n\nSo the time of the meeting approaches And the they decide the best way to mashes make this work is to disguise the Monk as one of Xolkin's mercs, and have her shoot Xolkin in the back from within the crowd. Then they could quickly jump sides to the elves, and let the mercenaries decide if a dead benefactor was worth a lot of them dying over. Fairly solid plan really. There was just one hitch...\n\nOn the evening of the meeting Xolkin marches a small army of 30 mercs + the adventurers and his own personal guard (the original six Bandits he had, now upgraded to Veterans). A small party of Elves wait at the very edge of the woods. Xolkin leaves the bulk of his army back a reasonable distance and approaches the elves with his guards and the party. Now I could tell you everything that was said, but all you really need to know was that compromise seemed impossible. As the talks are wrapping up, tempers flaring, a bolt comes flying out of the mass of thugs straight towards the parlay group. \n\nEveryone is stunned for a moment as all eyes stare, transfixed to the bolt buried in the chest of the elf leader. \n\nAs soon as the betrayal registers, a swarm of arrows comes ripping out of the trees, shedding Xolkin's men, as well as wounding himself and the party. \n\nNot exactly sure start to do, the party defends itself. Aggressively. The trees burst into flames as 3 well rested magic users unleash some of their most powerful spells. Elves die by the dozens. \n\nThe exception to this however, is the Nature loving Barbarian. Seeing his friends turn so quickly on the people he thought they were going to help just doesn't register. He does the only thing he can do, and that's Rage. (Player made an insanity check of his own free will,  failed and then rolled for who he'd target)\n\nThe barbarian draws his greataxe and unleashes his fury on the only one he can think to blame. Xolkin.\n\nTaking several blows from the barbarian, and not having his guards to help him anymore, Xolkin disengages and tries to flee from the barbarian; shouting at his remaining men to shoot it. \n\nHe doesn't get far. The barbarians massive legs propel him across the ground, and within 3 places he's caught up with Xolin, and his axe falls one final time, killing the Lord of Nightstone. \n\nUnfortunately now the barbarian is standing I an open field, with almost 30 crossbows aimed right at him. They fire. 30 streak towards the barbarian, but only 4 find their mark. But even with 4 bolts in him, and facing a firing line, he charges forward. \n\nSeeing their friend (and only tank) in danger, the party diverts their attention away from the elves and attempt to help the barbarian. Multiple spells find their way into their ranks, as the monk gives up his disguise and lays into the mercs nearest him. \n\nThe crossbowmen get off one more volley, and stick even more bolts into the barbarian, and still he refuses to go down. Seeing this the soldiers drop their weapons and surrender. \n\n________________________\n\nThe aftermath.\n\nThe party now has a shit ton of problems.\n\nA decimated clan of elves that will definitely be seeking vengeance. \n\nThe remaining Zhentarim in the town shut the gate and sent one of their flying snakes to ask for aid. (In 3 days they're going to have 50 Veterans riding up the path, being led by the level 15 leader of the Zhentarim for that region.) \n\nAnd to top it all off their barbarian, the only one in the party who can actually take damage, is having an existential breakdown. \n\nI'm so looking forward to seeing how this plays out now. I've totally forgotten there's still a campaign to run.",

        "text": "Alright, I will condense this as best I can. Year was 2012. Got invited to play DnD for the first time in my life. I show up with a work friend to another work friend's place and I jump in on the tail end of an already started quest.\n\n Basically, the party met a sorcerer. Sorcerer wants the party to find a princess under a sleep spell so he can break the curse. Party already found the broad and saved her. I'm ONLY hanging out as a traveling bard who may or may not continue with the group after they turn in the quest. Dig it? So, here's where things go off the rails.\n\n We stroll up to Mister Sorcerer and it QUICKLY comes obvious he's not after the princess for any nobel heroing or whatnot. He just wants a warm body that's asleep and can't say no to his wand. I take issue with this, but here's where we run into issue two. \n\n The reward the creep is offering (gloves of +3 whatever) is crazy good for another player, whom I will refer to as Carl. Now, Carl is rolling a lawful good character, and this presents a difficult conundrum for him; either benefit marginally, or leave an innocent woman to Mr. Badtouch. What's a guy to do? Well, ladies and gentleman, what you fail to understand is the 3rd and greatest pitfall of this story:\n\n Carl's a dick.\n\nSee, he had those mythril gloves of +3 hand jobs (or whatever) in his sights, and he wasn't about to abandon them now. Carl argued vehemently for leaving the girl, stating it was meant to be, just part of the quest. I, rolling a bard, had a higher charisma and was able to convince the party to not aid and assist in some Sleeping Beauty story gone wrong. The case seemed settled. We kindly told the warlock/creep where he could shove his crystal ball, and we left and made camp. Thats where we hit the 4th issue\n\nCarl is a dick (I know, I mentioned this, but he gets worse)\n\nCarl gets it in his mind he's gonna sneak the girl out of the camp, and take her back to the wizard while all of us are asleep. What Carl didnt anticipate was that meant he had to stealth roll to get out of his tent, into her tent, out of her tent (with her on his back), to the horses, then silently lead the horses away. Lot of stealth rolls. Lot of possibilities for error. Not many people were expecting a critical failure on the very first roll. Nor where we expecting his reaction to us discovering his fuck up was to try to shoot my character with an arrow (remember the part where I mentioned bards have higher charisma and I convinced the party to turn against his idea? Guess he took it personally).\n\n Long story short, blah blah blah, he gets lit up like the 4th of july in the deep south by EVERYBODY in the party. Guy's done. Magic, axes, my kickass lute solo, he didn't stand a chance.\n\nThat's when Carl launches out of his chair, his pudgy face breaking out into a sweat, and announces he no longer wanted us in his (parent's) house. He kicked us all out, but I still saw him at work the next day. He did not say much to me.",

The fortress of Gatehauled, and it's 19 dwarves, sat ensconced into a gap between two hills, the haulers slowly building an archer's tower on either side of the entrance, accessed from within the fort. Suddenly, the warning goes out- a Siege has begun! The dead walk! The overseer scans the area for a horde of undead, only to find a lone necromancer, and a wolf zombie. The wolf rushes, much faster than his master, and is shot to pieces by the archers. The necromancer was luckier, and dodges a shot or two, and actually closes in on the doors to the fortress, terrified haulers abandoning their slabs where they stand. Then... the necromancer trips. And falls into a five foot deep, fifteen foot wide pond. And drowns. The alarm goes silent, the siege is broken. The overseer stares at the drowned necromancer, until a hauler starts to retrieve his items, starting with the tome he carried- \"Death for everyone.\" I suppose that meant himself, too.",

They were hopelessly outnumbered by Tiseo's clones, let alone having Tiamat against them as well. They couldn't escape to their kingdoms, and backup couldn't reach them. They had to retreat and figure out a way to beat the five headed dragon from within the plane. \n\nFlamer obliged by casting *Transport Via Plants* and sending them across the island to Hepthurai. Tiamat's voice boomed out after them, mocking them for their weakness. Most villains should never monolog if they know what's good for them, but this was Tiamat: she could afford to gloat. She told them all about how she had been the one to manipulate Visrithis into waking the Colossi. How she had, in collaboration with Veetoo and her supporters, deceived the islanders into thinking there was something wrong with the Warforged. She had been behind the slaughter of Flamer's race. It was all Tiamat's doing. \n\nOnly, it wasn't Tiamat. It was Tiseo. \n\n\"BOW TO ME, YOUR ELDER EYE.\"  He announced his victory using the name he'd learned from the Mirlings. The genie's wishes and the vast amount of power he'd accumulated in the Dark Mirror had allowed him to finally achieve his goal; to become that which he feared. He now possessed Tiamat's body. And he intended to reign destruction down on those who had slighted him. \n\nOut of game, I was panicking. Just a little bit. \n\n* * *\n\nThe whole island heard Tiamat's proclamation of victory. Aelar Liadon acted swiftly, and broke Elo and Vanella out of Cosapai. The latter send a magical message to the other Tsethem, who all congregated at Little Orthraze. Tiamat was closing in quickly. They had less than an hour before she caught up and slaughtered them all.\n\nThey needed time to regroup and prepare themselves for the inevitable battle. They also needed allies, because they assumed that not even elemental protectors could take down such a creature. They needed creatures on their side who could strike fear into the heart of their foe. \n\nThey needed dragons of their own. \n\nVanella led them to her dusty little garage and revealed a hidden passage. It led down into the earth to an open cave by the cliffs, disguised from the outside by an illusion. An airship rested on support beams in the centre, golden EPEs and polished dark wood shining in the crystal light. This was V'nell's labor of love; a home for herself and her husband. She'd gone somewhat overboard with the design and had put in a few spare rooms; rooms which were now going to become very useful. \n\nThey quickly boarded and launched the majestic craft from the cave, shooting out over the sea with Tiamat in pursuit, a small speck in the sky. Eventually she was forced to give up the chase however. Her powerful dragon wings were no match for the quad elemental propulsion engines. They set their sights on the horizon and shot across the sea. Destination: the Dragonlands. \n\n* * *\n\nAnd thus began one of my favorite adventures in the whole campaign. Things couldn't have been more dire. The island was being ruled under the cruel claw of an enemy they thought long dead, their own kingdoms were unreachable. They had the scrapings of a plan and every odd against them. But even in the chaos of the situation, there was a pleasant calmness. The endless waves and fluffy clouds, the gentle hum of the engines. It was just the Tsethem and the sea. \n\nVind humbled himself and apologized to Flamer for turning against the Warforged. But Flamey wasn't ready to forgive him yet, even if he had just been a pawn in Tiamat's game. He couldn't even look him in the eye without breaking something.The scars were too fresh. \n\nCallie and Kilmorn explained to V'nell what had happened on the volcano. She wasn't surprised about her \"mother's\" actions, but the death of Michael Thane hit her rather hard. At the same time she was relieved that the Warforged malfunctions had been staged. She and Elo did her best to comfort Flamer, but although all three were technically Warforged it was hard for them to understand how Flamey felt about the loss of his comrades; neither of the pair were soldiers, after all. \n\nIt felt like a big family, to have them all literally in the same boat. They spent a whole month traveling across the sea together, sometimes flying and sometimes sailing. Callie and/or Kilmorn periodically fell overboard and had to be rescued. Lund tried to get Korena and Inalak together for a bit, before being sternly told by Della that clerics of the Supreme One weren't allowed to marry. Jaques discussed tactics with anyone who'd listen, while Tikka entertained their five children who had also been brought along. \n\nTurf had got married to an Elkore in the years since her last adventure, a humble man who ran an orphanage. In typical Turf style it was a quiet, no-nonsense event without any fanfare. She'd given birth to a daughter several months before, and was sorely missing the time she could be spending with little Lacey. \n\nKilmorn had a chat with Pekeski and explained the relationship between him and Callie: they were more like brother and sister than what Pekeski thought. They smoothed things over with each other, and Callie gave both of them a hug before falling into the water again. \n\n* * *\n\nAt long last they reached the end of their journey. The sea just dropped off at a certain point, like a huge waterfall over the rim of the seabed. Down it plunged into the mist, for as far as the eye could see. The Tsethem powered up the EPEs and gingerly descended with the water. \n\nFor several hours they continued to lower themselves past the thundering water. Then they stopped. The airship wasn't resting on anything solid, but it wasn't moving down any more. In fact it seemed to be bobbing a little, as though it was in the water. What's more, the foam blowing about seemed to have increased tenfold. \n\nIt took a little while for them to figure it out. They moved a short way from the seabed into the blue sky, and saw that another waterfall was colliding with the one they'd followed down. It was almost like a vertical mirror. Then Pekeski figured it out; they'd reached the collision point of gravity. That was why they weren't descending, and why the two waterfalls were being drawn to the same point. \n\nFlamer demonstrated it by jumping off the edge of the ship. He fell several feet before slowing down, then falling upwards and bobbing at the collision point. To continue, they'd have to turn the airship around. It was a rather complicated maneuver, but Flamer managed it with the help of Della, Inalak, and Vanella. They continued \"down\", but from their perspective they were now ascending. \n\nThey finally reached the underneath of the world. There was no sign of the Dragonlands. A vast ocean spread out before them, empty and calm. So calm that the airship's engines got buried in the sand when they landed, only two feet below the ocean floor at the waterfall's edge. They managed to pull themselves out but the aft EPEs were too damaged to fly. They'd have to continue over sea. \n\nThey spied something on the horizon: something flying. Their hearts were in their mouths as they expected it to be a dragon. But no, it was in fact an Aaracokra. \n\nI thought the virtual DM was messing with me here, but it was absolutely certain. An aging birdman landed on the deck, scraggly feathers adorned with what looked like shark hide and clutching a bone spear. He introduced himself as Quaff, and asked if they were more hallucinations. After assuring him they weren't, he introduced himself as Quaf and told them his story.\n\nHe'd been part of an expedition to find new lands twenty years ago, well before even the Great War. Their mission had been successful; they had discovered the Dragonlands, proving it to be more than a myth. The only problem? The dragons had also discovered them. \n\nTheir airships had been destroyed, leaving them stranded on the literal other side of the world. It was too far to fly back. Some of the crew had thought that if they jumped off the edge of the underneath, they could use the momentum of their upwards fall to half the distance needed to reach the top. But the gravity collision point isn't a smooth curve like when turning an airship at high speeds; its a sharp, instant change. Quaf and his best friend Arr theorized that anyone who reached that point at high speed would be pulverized by their own velocity. The rest of the expedition didn't listen to them, and jumped out of desperation. They never saw them again. \n\nSo Quaf spent the next couple of decades trying to survive. He eventually became friends with the dragonborn Arr became steadily more unhinged. He was angry with the crew for abandoning them, angry with Quaf for letting them leave. He became intent on finding a way to control the dragons, and recently succeeded in bringing one of the more animalistic sea wyrms under his command. Which he immediately turned against Quaf in his rage. \n\nThey weren't quite sure whether to believe him or not, as he was clearly a little batty himself. But after several more days of sailing, they came across proof of his story; the Dragonlands slowly came into view through the mist. Thousands of towering pillars rose up out of the sea, rocky and barren with only a hint of vegetation in their tops. They stood like so many teeth of a giant, rigid comb. They had finally found the legendary resting place of the Dragons. \n\nThe team rejoiced too soon. The waves churned as a fully grown sea wyrm rose up to starboard and headed straight for the ship. Arr was riding on its back, barnacles clinging to his beak and claws. It was time for a boss battle like no other. \n\nThe wyrm smashed into the side of the airship, damaging it badly but not enough to sink it. Flamer transformed into his nova form and flew straight into the creature's open mouth, then punched/melted his way his way through the side. Della called on the winds to create a barrier between the ship and dragony death, while Turf hacked away at the tough scales. Inalak tossed up a storm that actually hindered more than it helped, as V'nell used her upgraded gauntlets to fly around zapping lightning everywhere. All this, while Quaf and Arr duked it out on deck in an epic final duel. \n\nThe scarred, scared sea wyrm fled for its life as Arr fell to the deck with a speared heart. On land or sea, the Tsethem were a force to be reckoned with. \n\n* * *\n\nA few days later they reached solid ground. Each pillar was as tall as the highest peak of Mt. Tirkosu. They soon discovered that life still flourished on them though, as a group of primitive, sandy colored Dragonborn approached them and demanded to know their business. Kilmorn and Pekeski could both speak their language, and they learned a lot from them. \n\nDragons had been created as living repositories of wisdom. They were undying, which meant that no matter how long they lived they would never physically age. They were supposed to be guides and advisors to those in command, to learn from the mistakes of the past and build a better future. But when Tirkosu was created, the destructive power they had demonstrated in the war of the planes made the Colossi doubt the safety of bunging them and the other races together into the same location. So instead they were placed on the Dragonlands, and told to guard the artifact that had created the plane: the Worldforge. \n\nAnd that was when things fell apart. The dragons grew idle and started petty feuds with each other. The Dragonborn had been servants of their larger kin; dedicated stewards at best, and at worst, a slave race. But as they saw their once noble charges decline, they stopped treating them as demigods. But they continued to hold on to the knowledge of long ago, carving it into their \"walls of wisdom\", for anyone bold enough to seek it out. \n\nIt was amazing to explore a hitherto undiscovered culture. The aesthetic of the dust Dragonborn was particularly fun; due to the scarcity of greenery (and wood in particular) they had to make their tools and weapons out of bone and aquatic animals. Their technology was reminiscent of the kind used by the Elves back on Tirkosu, including contraptions such as a hang glider crafted from a lightweight giant crab shell, and a system of pullies that raised or lowered a giant fishing net. \n\nAround this time Lundal completed a bunch of magic items he'd been working on; a bunch of stone slabs that when drawn on with ink, the image or writing was shared across all of them. He shared them out with the other Tsethem as a means to communicate if they ever got separated. \n\nOut of game, this was a meta opportunity for me to create a chatroom to play around with. I actually saved the log, which is interesting to look back on now. It reads like something you'd see on a Discord server. \n\n* * *\n\nA MEETING OF THE BORED \n\n* * *\n\nFLAMER: Test. \n\nFLAMER: Oops, my apologies. \n\nFLAMER: I did not know this worked in such a way. \n\nDELLA: Hello Flamer! 😊 \n\nTURF: Hey there you two. \n\nFLAMER: Greetings. \n\nLUNDAL: A'ight there. \n\nTURF: So this is... What, exactly? \n\nTURF: Some sort of messaging system? \n\nFLAMER: Yes, it is a way for us to speak together, away from all the trials and tribulations of the world. \n\nLUNDAL: Sounds like a good idea to me. Those \n\nLUNDAL: Shad, I hit the wrong dang button. \n\nLUNDAL: Those sending stones were hella slow. \n\nDELLA: Don't swear, Lund. 😢 \n\nTURF: Why the title? \n\nFLAMER: I thought it would be amusing. \n\nFLAMER: I cannot seem to change it now. \n\nLUNDAL: Well it ain't like we need to make this public or anything, so in my book it's fine to have a title like that. \n\nTURF: So. Dragonborn. \n\nDELLA: Did Kilmorn talk to the tribe? Did they agree to show us where the Dragons are? \n\nFLAMER: I believe so. Pekeski and Korena went with him, and managed to come to an agreement. \n\nLUNDAL: You mean Pekeski did all the talking, and Korena figured out if they were lying or not. \n\nFLAMER: Something like that. \n\nLUNDAL: Damn duo are more trouble than they're worth if you ask me. \n\nTURF: No one asked you, Lund. \n\nDELLA: That's unfair, they've both been very helpful, and amazing in combat. ✊ I was surprised to find out Callie didn't receive any proper training. \n\nLUNDAL: They blue up the waterfront prison. \n\nFLAMER: *blew \n\nTURF: To be fair, that wasn't their fault. And they did get the intel. \n\nFLAMER: 🐢 \n\nFLAMER: Oops. \n\nLUNDAL: Eh. I guess they're a'ight in combat. It's when they're out of it that things all seem to go to shad. \n\nTURF: Regardless, Pekeski managed to convince them to point us in the general direction of the lairs. Now it's up to us. \n\nFLAMER: Turf \n\nLUNDAL: We can't take the airship. Too much damage. \n\nDELLA: It's Lindon now, not Thane. 💖 \n\nFLAMER: Turf \n\nTURF: What is it, Flamer? \n\nFLAMER: I can turn into a dragon. \n\nTURF: Awesome. \n\nLUNDAL: We all know that, Sparky. \n\nLUNDAL: Isn't it spelt Liadon, Del? \n\nDELLA: Oo, so it is. Sorry. 🙏 \n\nTURF: I think we'll be fine on foot. Most of us can fly anyway, we'll be able to find a way across the pillars. \n\nLUNDAL: Scary to think that was underneath the island this whole time. \n\nDELLA: We don't know if it was underneath, exactly; we might even be in a completely different plane. 🌏 \n\nVANELLA: Uh, yo. \n\nLUNDAL: A'ight there, spiky? \n\nFLAMER: Who invited Vanella? \n\nDELLA: Not that we're not happy to see you. 😊 \n\nVANELLA: So what'cha been talkin' 'bout? \n\nFLAMER: We have been discussing our next steps. \n\nTURF: Trying to figure out how to persuade the dragons to join the fight against Tiamat. \n\nLUNDAL: That thing ain't Tiamat. \n\nTURF: I know. But it was once, and it has the same body. We need to figure out how it can be brought down. \n\nVANELLA: What I'd like to know is: How da heq did this elder eye dude manage to get the body of a frickin' demigod? \n\nFLAMER: I too would like an answer to that. To prevent such a thing from occurring again. \n\nDELLA: She's not a demigod Vanella. There is only one true god, the Supreme One, and he has no equals. 😇 \n\nVANELLA: Yah, I gotcha. I jus' used that word to describe what kinda power level were dealin' with, if y'knowhamsayin'.\n\n DELLA: *we're \n\nVANELLA: Ah, shoot. Darn keyboard. Darn 4th wall. \n\nFLAMER: 4th wall? \n\nVANELLA: It's... Uh, nothin'. So how're we gonna move 'round with the airship outta c'mission? It's way too dangerous to try an' sail it through them rocks. \n\nTURF: We'll improvise. Most of us can fly, so we shouldn't have too much trouble. \n\nTURF: If that doesn't work out we can maybe charter some smaller boats from the tribes. \n\nVANELLA: Sounds like a plan. Fingers crossed we don't run into any evil Dragons... \n\nKORENA: Hello \n\nDELLA: Korena! 😊 \n\nKORENA: Della! \n\nFLAMER: Turf \n\nVANELLA: Aelar! \n\nLUNDAL: Quaf! \n\nLUNDAL: That reminds me, what are we gonna do about him? \n\nLUNDAL: We gonna bring him back, or let him stay, or what? \n\nTURF: That depends on his choice, really. He seems to have made a fairly decent living here. \n\nDELLA: I don't think that's a good idea... 😓 \n\nKORENA: He did seem a little... Unstable. \n\nVANELLA: Unstable? Dude, any more cooky an' he'd be best pals with... Oh Shad, I was gonna say Naliko, but... \n\nDELLA: Naliko 😖 \n\nLUNDAL: I think he's got enough brains on him to know if he can survive here or not. He'll be fine, either way. \n\nKORENA: 🏄 \n\nKORENA: Hey Vanella 🏄 \n\nVANELLA: Heh, neato. Man, makes me really miss catchin' waves on Orthraze beach... \n\nFLAMER: Fret not, we shall soon be back to a liberated home. Every step we take bring us closer to freeing the world of Tiseo's darkness for good. \n\nVANELLA: Uh, yah, sure. No need to go all protector-y over me dude, heh. \n\nVINDICUS: Test \n\nVINDICUS: Ah. It works. \n\nDELLA: Grayson! ☺ \n\nVANELLA: Yo Vind. \n\nLUNDAL: A'ight there Clanker? \n\nFLAMER: How do you remove someone from chat? \n\nTURF: Flamer... \n\nVANELLA: C'mon, man. He was makin' a call he thought was right. An' yah, it was hella wrong, but don't blame ya friend: blame the one who started it. \n\nFLAMER: I... Suppose so. \n\nVINDICUS: I will do everything in my power to atone for my actions. \n\nFLAMER: You had better. \n\nTURF: Okay now, stop squaring up to each other. Tiamat's whiskers... \n\nKORENA: I expect it feels strange saying that now? \n\nTURF: A little. \n\nVANELLA: Hells, I felt weird sayin' stuff like \"deammit\", or \"S'preme One\" When I found out they were all real... \n\nDELLA: But you still say hells 😞 \n\nVANELLA: I... Yah, I guess that's also kinda wrong. Welp, sorry Della. \n\nVANELLA: Can I call ya Del? I... I kinda feel like I should be callin' ya princess or summat'. \n\nDELLA: You may call me whatever you like. 😊 \n\nLUNDAL: I wanna be addressed as his Royal Highness Lundal the first, Prince of Elemental Steam, slayer of Olhydra and Yan-C-Bin. \n\nVANELLA: Or HRHLF PES SOY for short. \n\nLUNDAL: Okay maybe not. \n\nVINDICUS: Titles are meaningless in the end. All that remains is the will to do what must be done. \n\nLUNDAL: #killjoy \n\nINALAK: Heyyy \n\nVANELLA: Yo man. \n\nLUNDAL: Alright there Dreads. \n\nTURF: Hey Inalak. \n\nKORENA: Inalak! ☺ \n\nDELLA: Inalak! 😊 \n\nINALAK: What's everyone up to tonight? \n\nVANELLA: Messin' around, waitin' for Ae to get back from fishin'. \n\nFLAMER: Charting the stars. They're different on this side of the world. \n\nLUNDAL: Nothing much. \n\nVINDICUS: I must leave. Farewell. \n\nKORENA: Thank the Supreme One... \n\nLUNDAL: Be interesting if clerics were allowed to marry, wouldn't it Inalak? \n\nINALAK: Go away. \n\nLUNDAL: Isn't that right, Shiny? \n\nKORENA: Shoo. \n\nTURF: Stop teasing them, Lund. \n\nDELLA: It isn't right to trifle with one's feelings like that. \n\nLUNDAL: Who's trifling? Just making speculations is all. \n\nVANELLA: So freakin' tired... Imma turn in. Until then, peeps, I'll be seein' ya. \\*gives a two-fingered salute\\*\n\nINALAK: Bye \n\nLUNDAL: Later, Spiky. \n\nTURF: Bye Vanella. \n\nFLAMER: Farewell. \n\nFLAMER: I too feel the need to power down for a bit. That sea snake took it out of me, I think. \n\nLUNDAL: Yeah, I should get some shut eye. \n\nDELLA: Me two. \n\nKORENA: Me three. \n\nTURF: Bye. \n\nTURF: 🐨 \n\n* * *\n\n\nThe Dragonborn tribe agreed to take the Tsethem to see the dragon lord who owned all the nearest pillars, but warned that he wouldn't be happy to see trespassers in his domain. They were right; he not only refused to help them fight against Tiamat, he also attacked them after they'd finished explaining the situation. Apparently he didn't think the living weapon's influence would extend to the other side of the world. The Tsethem carved him up and returned to the Dragonborn. \n\nThey were dragonless, but hope wasn't lost. The Dragonborn were happy enough to share their wisdom, and directed them towards the center of the Dragonlands. The Worldforge stood where all ten elements converged, a Colossi-sized anvil of black obsidian. \n\nLundal set to work, and over the next ten days forged an ornate mask for each Tsethem that allowed them to become truly one with their element. From a mechanical side, each mask could indefinitely cloak the wearer in an investiture spell according to the mask type. Legendary items for legendary heroes. \n\n* * *\n\nThey were finally ready to bring the fight back to Tiamat. Vanella *Teleport*ed them back to the airship as Della opened a gateway for them to sail through. They arrived a few miles from Little Orthraze and were shocked at what they saw: the sea had frozen over. \n\nThose who could disguise themselves went ashore to find out what had happened to the island in their absence. They met a resistance group in a tavern (because that's where all good resistance groups hang out) who informed them that not long after Tiamat had claimed Cosapai as her throne, the island's elements had shifted. It was almost like they had been turned thirty degrees; Little Orthraze was now covered in ice, Paku had become exceptionally humid and steamy, Pehkeiai was choked with swampy greenery, Appinamopu was flooded, and so on. The people had been doing their best to adapt to their new environments, but it was made difficult with Tiamat's army keeping them from venturing out of their villages. \n\nThey returned to their ship to plan and prepare. The attack was imminent. \n\n* * *\n\nI actually ran the fight using a copy of the D&amp;D Epic, Reclamation of Phlan. It fit perfectly with the theme of the adventure, with a preliminary storming of an iced-up port, an air strike on a city to let the main forces through, and then a climatic final battle with a dragon. Of course, the virtual DM put his own twist on things, but for the most part it ran by the book. It was also frantic as heq, as I played out the whole ~50 encounter storming over a single weekend. \n\nThey split up into three teams; the resistance, the breachers, and the main force. The resistance started the attack with a raid on Little Orthraze, mostly to draw Tiamat's forces away to that location while the two other teams headed for Hepthurai. A man called Mehmen Windriver led the charge across the ice wielding Angelica's sunsword. He and Mayvern been good friends before her sudden death in the Dark Mirror, and he had inherited her weapon. Tiseo's clones fell before the blade, and Little Orthraze was liberated. \n\nThe breachers included the Danger Duo, Elo and Vanella, and Tikka. They took griffons from Hepthurai, planning to destroy Cosapai's main gate using a devastation orb supplied by the resistance. There were several intense airborne fights with wyvern-riding Tiseos before they reached their objective. Then it all went pear shaped. \n\nThe devastation orb had malfunctioned. V'nell was holding it at the time. She had the most expertise with arcane tech, but I've found that she also doesn't work well under pressure. The countdown had started, and she had three rounds to fix it. She fluffed the first check, and then the second. The DC increased every second she failed to shut it down. It was the final roll, and it had to be a 19 or higher. The other breachers had fallen back out of the blast radius, except Tikka who was attempting to calm V'nell down. I really thought she might pull it off in an action-movie-esque countdown stop. \n\nBut she didn't. There was no epic save, no last minute heroism. The orb exploded. \n\nI thought she'd died. I mean, it was a devastation orb; those things had leveled whole towns. But when I finally stopped pacing and wringing my hands to roll the damage, and even when I counted in the extra hurt from the hundred foot fall, she was still alive. Just barely. \n\nThe same couldn't be said for Tikka Torrem. \n\n* * *\n\nThe main force was comprised of the four original Tsethem, Pekeski, Inalak, Korena, Vindicus, and Jaques. They stormed the citadel with blinding speed, using their masks to maximum efficiency. Before long they marched into the grand hall and stood before Tiamat herself. She was flanked by two people who looked diminutive compared to her colossal size; Veetoo the traitorous Warforged, and the Elkore that had sheltered Tiseo after he'd broken out of Orthraze. This was the be all and end all: the Tsethem versus the living weapon. \n\nThe battle was ferocious. Tiamat had backed herself into a corner; she should have been out in the open where her flight would have been put to use. Instead she had nowhere to turn when the Tsethem rushed her. Jaques and Pekeski took care of the Elkore. Inalak was nearly roasted alive by dragon breath, but Korena healed him swiftly. Vind  and Turf slashed away at Tiamat with their swords, while Lindale repeatedly stabbed at her face and Della tried to knit their own wounds. \n\nFlamer... Flamer owned that night. Tiamat picked him as a target first, probably because of how scary he looked with fire billowing from his mask. But try as she might, she couldn't even put a dent in his armor. The full force of the most powerful creature on the plane couldn't make him bow. \n\nIt was Turf who delt the final blow. She pinned the last head beneath her boot and let Revenge fall with a boom. No epic final words. No desperate struggle for survival. Just another death of the enemy they'd killed long ago. The final incarnation of Tiseo.\n\nThey walked out of the ruined city, victorious. \n\n* * *\n\nIt was morning. I'd played for nearly twenty four hours and I was Shattered with a capital S. I popped on some sad fantasy music and considered the events that would unfold from here. Tiamat was no longer the ruler of the plane, so Turf and Co. would be able to bring their armies down to destroy the rest of Tiseo's clones. Maybe one or two would survive, but they would be easy enough to hunt down and destroy. \n\nThe island had changed. The elements had been scrambled, probably due to the influx of shadow; Tiamat's lair in Cosapai had created a similar effect as the one that had destroyed Orthraze, spreading necrotic energy across the buildings and allowing Mirlings to rear their ugly heads. If they couldn't figure out how to fix it, the villagers would either have to move villages or simply adapt. \n\nJaques... I can't really describe how he felt about Tikka's death. He was numb, like he couldn't believe it. Della tried to resuscitate her to no avail. She was gone, and she wasn't coming back. V'nell felt terrible about indirectly causing her death, so much that she actually decided to give up the mantle of Tsethem before Aelar convinced her otherwise. \n\nPekeski got plastered during a celebration banquet and decided to propose to Callie. She accepted, and despite how he later felt terrible about doing it in such an impromptu manner, I think it was the the best; I doubt he'd have plucked up the courage otherwise. They were married in Pernep and bought a little cottage not too far from where Callie's father lived. \n\nThrough all the tears and celebration, there was one character who I felt the most for. Flamer had grown accustomed to his unofficial title of Sage in Karu Sampur. Absence makes the heart grow fonder, and his time as the prince of elemental fire made him realize that his true place was among the Warforged. Now they were gone, and so was his hope of ever truly belonging to a people. \n\nMarianne Sterling had confirmed it while she was still alive: with proper upkeep Warforged could theoretically live forever. Flamer, as well as Elo and Vanella, would watch their friends grow old and die. He didn't know what he could otherwise do with all that time, so he set out to travel the planes and beyond. To store knowledge for the coming generations, as had been the dragon's purpose. \n\nThere was nothing else left for him to do. \n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\nLong one this time, so sorry for the delay. Worth it though. I loved this particular adventure, it had a very unique feel to it. Next chapter involves a big timeskip, so this kinda marks the end of an era",

        "text": "Greetings to the 12! If this title sounds odd to you, then it is causing good and bad rolls happened when they should have not. So like any good story :) Apologize for misswriting or bad formating, writing this will working. \n\nTo understand how and what happened, the story will have to be split up into 3 parts, as the group was partly Split. The Party moved to Baliho from Donnerbach after solving an Adventure and moving south to Fasar\n\nWitch: The Witch was looking for information after encountering an old Fay and looking for the lost Library. So she went to the local library of Undra. Researching on the subject matter took the whole day, and no clues were found, even with the help of some locals in the library. So with this, the day turned into evening and the Witch went back to the local Tavern for some rest and refreshment, hearing from the others, what they have done in the meanwhile. \n\nTrader and the Vagabond: So the Vagabond was not happy, not being able to use magic or understand it. Considering she has been cheated before and lost, while she was also cheating, she was not able to catch out the other guy as she did not understand magic. So the Trader suggests looking for the Thiefs in the town and some Phex followers who may be able to help. Interested in the idea, they were going to the most run-down Tavern in town. Fast they saw people stealing from each other, and decided to follow one of the guys quietly. Well, at least that was the intention. While trader shadow stalked the thief like a master, the Vagabond ran after him and shouted out things that come to her mind to looks less suspicious, which of course in return took the attention of the thief. When finding a store which sells bread, she runs in calling out \"Bread, yes I am here to buy bread. Such good lovely bread!\" while the Thief disappeared in the next corner. Still followed by the Trader, he showed the Vagabond the way and they met with the Thief in the alleyway. He just stood there waiting against the wall. So the Vagabond took the initiative and tried to positively approach him, being a bit flirty. No reaction though confused she tried a more direct approach, still no reaction. After some time of confusion, she stepped closer and tipped against him, just to see that he fell over dead with a hole in the chest. What now! let's look the body :) cause that's what adventures do. Finding a note for a next meeting and the purse of money which was stolen seemed like a good find! But we can not leave it like this right? So let's call in a guard and tell them what happened. When coming back though with the guard, the corpse was gone. Unhappy, the guard asked for \"compensation\" for the fake call. Paying up, the two were looking around to find a hidden entrance into the sewers. Walking along, they found a gate with a really good lock. But the Vagabond, while not sneaky, was really good at opening locks, and so he did with a critical success. Moving on looking out for traps, the two hear footsteps. The Gm gives out a warning,\" If you fight, you will lose\". Still, the Trader decides he is better with the bow and the long way would give enough time to hit them with so many arrows, they would die before they reach him. The Vagabond, however, decided this is a bad idea and basically started to swim in the sewers and play dead. So the Trader said, screw this, and left. One of the two figures passed by the fake corpse, while the other poked it with a sword a bit. She managed to keep calm though and ignore it, so nothing happened. Here the part splits again.\n\nVagabond: As the two opponents move away, following the trail of the trader, she got up soaked in shit and moved onwards finding a door. Politely, she knocked....... After the first knock, the voiced went silent inside. She knocked again, maybe she was not heard? The door slightly opened and she was let in. Finding 5 people inside, 4 of those literally throw up when smelling her. The 5th, however, was just confused and nauseated by the smell. Explaining that she just happens to pass by and were looking for the thief guild, she was knocked out. \n\nTrader: The trader managed to hide from the Followers and got back to the tavern. Cleaning up, he approached the Witch and explained the situation, imagining that the Vagabond is probably caught by the Assassin guild, considering how fast the guy was killed. Being unclear how, and profoundly confused by this dumb situation, the Trader explained that they may be able to use the thief guild, for which he has the notes to know when and where they meet and use them against the Assassin guild. Considering the tired mind of the Witch had no better idea besides waiting, she agreed. Both went onwards to the meeting in the Tavern and waited. The Tavern owner definitely a bit nervous, waited before everyone else left besides a few individuals. Those gathered at the table and discussed what happened in the past, loot placement and guild matter. Without suspicion, the Trader and Witch joined the conversation, even made suggestions and behaved like guild members, all good so far. It looked like though there was already hate between he Thief Guild and the Assassin guild. So knowing where their potential Headquarters was, they suggested going for it. The others agreed mostly, but the elders decided to council first. So while people were chatting among themselves, happy, the trade wanted to leave the establishment. He realized then, that the door was locked. Oh dear! He called out and all other areas seem to be locked too. What now? Looking out of the window, the Witch finds a person, covered in a hoody in front of the door waiting. Using a Charm spell, she manages to cast and then opened the door. The first response of the person was to headbutt the Witch. On the floor, the lights go out, rumble happened and people call out in agony. All of the Thief Guild members are dead. The hooded person walks in and then reveals, its the Vagabond! The other members are confused. Why?\n\nflashback After the first adventure, the members found a skull, with a Ribbon. They found out that the Ribbon is actually cursed and allows the Skull, thinking they are still alive, take over someone else's body if they lose control. Additionally, the Skull is indestructible, or at least to the adventures\n\nflash forward Looking at the Vagabond, the party members realize, that the vagabond is wearing the Ribbon of \"Skully\". Aware of the potential, they are looking at her and say \"Hey Skully\" and Skully answers back \"So good to see you guys\". To cut a long conversation short, Skully made them an offer they can not refuse and made them join the Assassin Guild. People which previously misbehaved to her did not get the tattoo on the underarm, but on their ass cheek. \n\nFlashback When the Vagabond was out of order, Skully took over, talking to them and challenging the mightiest of the Assassin to break the Skull. If they can not, their lost and lose their life, if they win, they can kill the Vagabond. Intrigued a guildmember tried and fails. Having a talking skull which seems indestructible seem pretty impressive, so they decided to let the Vagabund, Skully, join the guild. Having the current impression, Skully suggested to the Assassin guild to take on the Thieves Guild, as she knew they would have a meeting today, from the lost note. They take her opp on the opportunity.\n\nflashforward Now the Witch managed to get from coming back reading from books to joining the Thieves guild thanks to the other members, and then Strong Armed into joining the Assassin guild. Trying to process this the next morning, she was discussing with the other members what to do? Meanwhile, the Vagabond was back to normal, was Skully was \"asleep\". \n\nThis all happened within 4 hours of in-game time, after coming back from the Library. I do hope you enjoyed the read and our misshapen. The adventure was entirely made up and not prepared for the GM. It was very well told and a lot of fun, so respect for him.",

        "text": "Twas the day after Christmas    \nAnd in the game store    \nThe players assembled    \nTo role play some more    \n\nMore rapid than eagles    \nThe players they came    \nAnd I waved them over    \nAnd called them by name    \n\nIt's LuvLock, it's Midir,    \nIt's Sir Richard Burns    \nIt's Sir Elvenbeard    \nAnd Damien’s turns    \n\nAnd, of course, me    \nThe game’s own dark god    \nThe DM himself    \nAnd vampire, Strand    \n\n**The Party:**\n\nDamien, the LG Paladin - Decided to spend time with his mom instead of playing games. That’s a very honorable action. It seems he’s now staying in character out of game. \n\nLuvLock, the NN Warlock - He bought me a Christmas gift. I am now the proud owner of a folding dry-erase grid. I forget the exact size, but I think it makes like a 3ft x 3ft square. I can’t reward out of game behavior with in game benefits, but I do really appreciate it. This’ll be good for a battle map if we ever do IRL playing in the future.\n\nMidir, the NG Gladiator - Has hopefully learned why splitting the party is a bad idea. It’s a good thing I don’t like deviating from the book too much. If I were the mean, leaving the safety of the party would be an auto-kill. This is, after all, a horror game.\n\nSir Elvenbeard the Vast, the CN Pirate - Very concerned about the status of the wine. When he enters a new room, it’s the first thing he looks for. I think he may have a problem.\n\nSir Richard Burns, the LN Cleric - Currently the most observant person in the party. He has the apparently mystical ability to remember where doors are and that stairs generally allow people to traverse between floors.\n\n**The Story:**\n\nPreviously, the party visited the Wizard of the Wines winery to fight some druids. The Fighter went upstairs and is now surrounded by two Vine Blights. The rest of the party is downstairs in the fermentation room with a dead druid. After the druid died, the party began investigating the room. The Pirate rushed to the wine vat to see if the druid had tampered with the wine. He discovered a nearly empty bowl with the remnants of some foul smelling liquid. He doesn’t know much about potions, but it was clear that nothing this foul could be medicinal. He was about to taste the wine before the Cleric warned him that if the wine was poisoned, the Pirate would be poisoned by drinking it. Meanwhile, Ismark noticed a small form skittering across the floor towards one of the fermentation vats. He investigated and found a small hole in the side of the vat. A quick glance inside revealed numerous small figures inside the vat. Ismark jumped back in surprise and called a warning to the Warlock, who cast Shatter on the vat. It, well, shattered into pieces revealing the broken bodies of some twenty-odd twig blights who had been hiding inside. A quick sweep of the room revealed no other enemies, so they resumed their investigation. \n\nUpstairs, the Fighter was in a fight for his life. One of the vine blights caught him in its vines while the other got in some free hits. He used Second Wind to restore some health and lost it by his next turn. He broke free of the blight and stood there panting. The vine blights were injured, but not as badly as he was. The Fighter resigned himself to his fate and swore to take one of his foes down with him but before he could act, the Cleric walked into the room. Seeing his wounded friend, the Cleric cast healing magic on the Fighter. Now that his hit points were (mostly) restored, the Fighter resumed his offensive. The Cleric called down the hall and soon the Pirate and Warlock joined the fray. They made quick work of the vine blights and went back downstairs to finish searching the main level of the winery. \n\nThey found a staircase in a glass blowing room that led to a cellar. Ismark, the Warlock, and the Pirate went down while the Paladin, Cleric, and Fighter made their way to another staircase they’d seen. Ismark stopped his group at the bottom of the stairs to listen at the door they presumed opened on the cellar. He heard several things moving but couldn’t determine what they were. So they devised a plan. The Pirate would open the door, run out into the room, get the attention of the bad guys, and run back in. So that’s what they did, or at least tried to do. In reality, the Pirate rushed through the door and immediately ran into a needle blight that attacked him. A druid in the back of the room yelled and produced a deafening shockwave that shattered the wine bottles stored in the cellar. Then more blights of the vine and needle varieties stepped out of the shadows and converged on the Pirate. The Pirate was able to disengage from his attacker with only minor injuries and retreat to safety behind Ismark. \n\nWhile they were fighting, The Fighter, Cleric, and Paladin were exploring the other set of stairs leading down. They too emerged in the cellar, but this room was devoid of enemies. They could, however, see enemies in the next room over. Thus began the world’s most accidental pincer attack. At first they didn’t even realize that the rest of the party was there. It wasn’t until the Paladin heard the Warlock casting spells that they realized that the enemy was pinned between them. The full party defeated the blights and the druid and then began looting the room. There wasn’t much loot to speak of. Only two bottles of wine survived the druid’s spell and none of the fallen enemies had anything of value on their bodies. So the party decided to keep exploring. They spied a ramp in one corner of the room and followed it up, only to run into the horde to needle blights from the previous session. While the players had been running around the winery, the needle blights had massed outside of the barricaded door. And the ramp had an exit 5 feet from said door. The Cleric, Paladin, Warlock, and Ismark stayed to fight the needle blights and the Pirate and Fighter ran past them (luckily taking no damage) and continued up the ramp.\n \nOn the ground floor, the four party members started picking off needle blights one by one. The Paladin stood in front with his shield and sunsword. Behind him, the Warlock used Eldritch Blast. The Cleric blessed the Paladin and Warlock and provided healing where needed. And Ismark… provided emotional support? I don’t know. He just kind of stood there “in case he was needed”. This tactic worked well and over the next few rounds they were able to kill several needle blights. \n\nUpstairs, the Pirate and Fighter  emerged from the ramp into a room that overlooked the loading bay where they had entered the winery. They could see the needle blights through a large hole in the floor and, sitting on a winch above the hole, a druid. He garbled something at them in some druidic tongue and promptly dropped through the hole. The Pirate jumped down after the druid and landed on a cart in the loading bay. He saw the druid run out of the bay and round the corner of the house and followed as swiftly as he could. And just like [Han Solo in *A New Hope*](https://media.giphy.com/media/3oFzmb0gt1xyLJk3vy/giphy.gif), he immediately ran into another group of needle blights. Unfortunately, he was at the end of his movement and the needle blights had all of theirs. The Pirate turned and tried to escape but the needle blights were able to catch him. They surrounded him and dropped him to 0 hp. The session ended with the Pirate unconscious and bleeding, the Fighter trying to figure out a way to save him without dying, and the rest of the party killing needle blights, unaware that one of their number may soon perish.\n\nIt was a lot of fun playing in person. I’ve missed it since moving away. I got a couple odd looks at the game store while setting up the TV and laptop, but once I explained what I was doing people got interested. One gentleman even loaned me his Curse of Strahd DM screen. A couple players, the Cleric and Pirate, have only ever role played on Roll20 so it was entertaining to see them react to all of the different shapes of dice. I caught them looking at the store’s dice display after we finished. I think they might be well and truly hooked. Busy work schedules have pushed our next game to mid-January so until then I’ll be prepping CoS and working on a new setting I’ve thought up. What is it? Two words: Catholic Werewolves. Anyway, may your 2018 be full of many memorable game tales.\n",

        "text": "HOLIDAYS IN DANTOOIINE : A NULL PERSPECTIVE. \nTravelling and radio signal. Faint. Summoned the nerdy fleshbag. He pushed some buttons and cleared the signal. Dantooine has some diplomats we need to rescue. Sounds like we could get some destruction in. Land beautifully a couple of clicks from the source. Outbound to source suddenly soldier's attacked by a feline beast. He hits it pretty well for a neck queefer and that hacky chap finishes it off. Guess I am not needed there.\nWe approach the base. Sadly these are not the people I can shoot at but they promise to lead us to some that I can shoot at. \n\nAs we approach I spot 2 defensive turrets. I sneak up to one and it's oddly empty.. except for the dead guy I made there. I take a seat and revel in the controls and the destruction at my fingertips. An imperial fleshbag asks me what I am doing .. I tell him maintenance and he returns to whatever unimportant dross he was doing before. The base itself looks pretty quiet. I summon hackysack on the radio. Hackysack pushes some more buttons disables the other turret and gets a floor plan. Hackysack and the soldier go into the base and get in reasonably easily.\n\nThere's complete silence for a while - the fleshy guys are taking their sweet time luring dudes to my turret. Suddenly it's on .. 4 guys run out and engage the soldier. I get a nice shot off and that guy's pretty much mist. I guess the other guys are fighting, I ca not get them on my visor. Fire another shot and off 2 rounds .. 2 more clouds of red. This thing is THE SHIT!!!  More troopers come out and some dude in the base looks to be on our side, he's fired a few shots and not at us. I tag him to make sure I do not smack him. There's some chaos at the entrance and some ungodly noise. Sounds like Jabba's fattest relative queefed. More guys run out and a Sith takes on Hackysack. I fire at him and he takes a big hit. A rocket glances off my turret and I pick off another pair.  [EOF] \n**\nShit's goin' down homie. New dude in the base lays another few shots off, I smite another 2. I want one of these things for home. Suddenly Hackysack has 2 sabres. Another rocket comes in - this's a solid hit and it's going down. I dive out and just make it before it's destroyed. [EOF] \n**\nNewbro's chasing some guys in what looks to be pilot suits. They are a good 150m away and he's waving a grenade, the fuckwit. Anyway he falls over. I line one of the pilots up and he's nullified. Some more activity at the base, but the other pilot's closing. Another round, another still target. The base looks empty but our guys are out and heading to the ship. \n\nThe ground starts to shake - something big's coming and we are not clear yet. I get the codes from Hackysack over our radio and enable the other turret and hop in. Over the hill come 2 ATSTs. I get one shot off and hit the leader in the knee but it will not go down. The Tie Fighter takes off.. Newbro got it up after all. I get another 2 rounds off. Nice solid hits on each ATST, both in the legs but they are still up. In comes a rocket and the turret's gone. Again I get lucky and escape. I hide and manage to evade the walker as the fighter comes in and fires a couple of shots. I sneak up and almost get trampled then place a C4 charge on it's leg and set a timer. I then nope out of there. The Tie keeps going but I make it to the ship.",

Veetoo forgot how to talk. Then the assaults started. Random attacks on innocent villagers, by Warforged who subsequently forgot what they'd just done. There was something seriously wrong with their mechanical bodies. \n\nFlamer had taken up residence not far from the village of Karu Sampur. For the preceding months people from all over the island had journeyed to his humble cave to seek guidance and wisdom. Learning that his brothers in arms were going haywire worried him greatly. But there wasn't much he could do; when he inspected the few that had displayed the abnormalities, he didn't detect anything wrong with them. No curses, no brain damage, no nothing. They seemed completely fit and healthy. He eventually departed for the plane of steam to seek out Lundal's help in diagnosing the problem. \n\nThe turning point came when the Elkore elder's daughter was killed by a rampaging Warforged. The smokefolk are normally a peaceable, artistic race, but when angered they show a completely different side. They called for another council at little Orthraze, the first one since the rise of the dragon cult. All the elders gathered to discuss what to do. \n\nIt didn't go smoothly. The villages were divided; the Elkore wanted the Warforged to be put down, and they were backed by the Humans, Dwarves, and Gnomes. The Warforged wanted to wait and see how things developed; Flamer was working on figuring out a cure, and it was only time before he found one. Advocating for their right to live were the Aaracokra, Aasimar, and Golath. The Elves and Merfolk stayed neutral, preferring not to side with one or the other. They also forbade Tikka and Inalak, their respective Tsethem, from getting involved in the conflict. \n\nBecause conflict was inevitable. The Elkore were on the warpath, and those rallying with them agreed that the Warforged had become a threat big enough to warrant their eradication. They formed an army, much smaller than the one that had taken on the dragon cultists, but still large enough to overcome the metal men with ease. In return, the Tharth sent holy warriors, the Aaracokra sent their griffon riders, and the Golath spared their best muscle to stand in defense of the fire race. \n\nI used the UA mass combat rules for this battle, and they worked fantastically. As the attackers charged they were ambushed on both sides by the Golath and Aaracokra. The maneuver was ineffective however, as the former were crushed by the golems brought along by the humans, and the latter were all but destroyed by the arcane cannon wielding Gnomes. \n\nBut the villagers weren't the only players on the field; the Tsethem had been called on to aid their villages. Pekeski had been given emergency Tsethem status by the Icefolk, and now stood alone against the golems. He fought bravely, and managed to decimate the constructs before having his lower half crushed under their weight. The golems marched on with the attackers, leaving the loyal dragonborn near death. \n\n* * *\n\nVindicus had led the charge across the tidal causeway to Karu Sampur. He had always distrusted the Warforged, and their malfunctions were now proof to him that his wariness had been justified. On the opposite side, Korena Ionu defended the Warforged. They met halfway down the volcano and engaged in battle. Korena had secretly been waiting for this moment ever since she and Vind had met. This was the ultimate test of her powers: Tsethem of Light against Tsethem of Smoke. And while they fought, while elemental energy crackled through the air as their blades clashed, they duelled with words. \n\n&gt; Ionu: They have a right to live! They are creature of this world, just like you and I! \n&gt;\n&gt; Strell: They threaten our lives, so their own are forfeit! \n&gt;\n&gt; Ionu: How can you say that? You fought side by side with them! They won the Great War for you! You would have your own soldiers' blood on your hands? \n&gt;\n&gt; Strell: Your compassion blinds you, Korena. They are machines, built for a purpose they no longer serve. \n&gt; \n&gt; Ionu: They have souls! They have a right to live! You should be ashamed! \n&gt;\n&gt; Strell: I will not be ashamed. Not for making the hard choice. For protecting my people. For this bloodless war!\n\nThe weird thing is; I can't remember who won. The battle was brutal, that I'm sure of. Vind's incredible speed and crippling eldritch blasts clashed against Korena's powerful smites and defensive fighting style. But I cannot for the life of me remember who came out the victor. A part of me remembers Korena smiting her opponent into the dust, but then the other half remembers being thankful that she fell before Vind's soul-stealing blade crit her. \n\nThis was a monumental occasion, two Tsethem fighting each other. You'd think that I would have remembered it. But I can only assume that the insane events that followed wiped their little combat completely from my mind. \n\n* * *\n\nFive hours before the attack. \n\nVanella Thane Liadon was scared. Her memory was a mess already, so knowing that the Warforged were experiencing amnesia and attacking people gave her serious cause to worry. She and Aelar had been married earlier that year, and the thought that she could suddenly turn and try to kill him drove her crazy. \n\nThey'd visited her \"parents\" in Cosapai to try and figure out what to do. Michael Thane was one of the main advocates for the destruction of the Warforged, but his \"daughter\" was a different matter; he suggested that she and Elo should be locked up until they found a solution, and they agreed. \n\nBy \"find a solution\", Michael meant \"kill the Warforged\". He and Marianne headed out to Karu Sampur shortly after, with an army of golems in tow. \n\n* * *\n\nThese same golems proved highly effective on the battlefield. It took the combined efforts of half the Aasimar forces to take them down. But the real conflict wasn't in the battle between men and machine, it was in Callie Longstrider's conscience. She was reluctant to fight against the Warforged but her duty to the Dwarves as earth Tsethem demanded that she do so. It was only when when the griffon carrying Kilmorn crashed not a hundred feet from her that she stood up for what she believed. She helped her best friend up, and called to the Dwarven Chieftess; she was on the side of the Warforged now. \n\nThe Dwarves turned on her and Kilmorn, which was a mistake. These two were part of the team that destroyed half of the Mirling contingent that had attacked Pernep. They were used to taking on large groups. Soon the Dwarves were running back down the slope with fear in their hearts. \n\nCallie and Kilmorn stood side by side, and undivided. The Aasimar knights sent the rest of the attackers scurrying along with the earthfolk. It seemed like the Warforged were safe for now. \n\nAnd then Marianne rose up from the shore on mechanical wings that cut through the skin on her back. She soared over the battlefield and rained destruction down on the fleeing Warforged. Everyone knew she was powerful, but just how much was displayed for all to see as she systematically picked off her own creations. She was nigh impossible to hit from such a distance. The Warforged never stood a chance. All of them had gathered there to defend their kind, and every single one of them was slaughtered.\n\nFlamer took that moment to drop back from the plane of Steam. Lundal had promised to bring Turf and Della back to Tirkosu to look into the issue, so Flamey had returned ahead of him. He saw the carnage before him. The metal husks that had minutes earlier housed his brothers were strewn across the volcanic rock. Above them flew Marianne Thane, like an angel of death over slaughtered lambs. \n\nFlamer went berserk. I hadn't seen him fight like that since the battle against Imix's shard. He was a mass of pure molten rage. But Marianne was ready for him; she trapped him in a *Forcecage* and left him no option but to plane-hop out into Della's palace. Flamey was out of spell slots. It would take him several minutes to locate Dell and get her to hop them back down to Tirkosu. For a moment it looked like Marianne would escape.\n\nBut the danger duo weren't going to let that happen. As Callie turned her arrows on the mad scientist, a wounded Michael staggered towards them and yelled for them to leave her be. Before Kilmorn could even start to take him on, Callie shot the former Grand High Commander straight through the head. He crumpled to the rock, dead.\n\nThere was a stunned silence before Marianne exploded with wrath. Anger doesn't even begin to describe it. She'd spent eight years trying to bring Thane back, only to have him snatched from her grasp just after they had been married. She viciously attacked Callie and Kilmorn, and had she been in a better state I'm sure she would have killed them. But the battle against Flamer had taken it out of her, and after several rounds she was forced to flee. \n\nCallie nocked an arrow to her oathbow, marked Marianne as her sworn enemy, and shot her in the back. She hit the ground and didn't get back up. \n\nThe Warforged were dead, and the attackers had lost a serious percentage too. Neither side had won the battle. \n\nDella plane-hopped Flamer back down to Karu Sampur, and Lundal followed with Turf soon after. If Warforged could shed tears, Flamer would have wept bitterly. His race, his fellow soldiers, his family, were gone. \n\nTurf and Lund did their best to comfort him while Dell rushed around trying to heal the wounded Aasimar. Eventually, she found Pekeski's body and called the danger duo over. In his last moments, Kilmorn's clone had drawn something in the grey sand. Callie's name, enclosed in a heart. \n\nThis really got me in the feels, I don't mind admitting it. I'd known that Pekeski had a thing for her since way back in 4 AFO, but it had never come to anything so far because he was such a loyal warrior. Callie and Kilmorn were very close, so much so that Pekeski thought they had *feelings* feelings for each other. And he would rather die than do anything to betray his master. \n\nIt was like an unfortunate love triangle, although there really was no triangle at all because Kilmorn honestly didn't feel the same way about Callie. It was only in the final moments of his relatively short life that Pekeski had plucked up the courage to confess his love. And now he was gone. \n\nFlamer approached the mourning duo and started to cast a spell on their fallen friend. There isn't any proper heaven in this campaign yet. When worthy people die, their souls go to a \"waiting\" space where they relive their favorite moment of their life, again and again without it getting tiresome. While resurrection magic allows them to return, most choose not to. Exceptions are people who haven't had the greatest of memories, or people with unfinished business. Flamey guessed that Pekeski was one of the latter. \n\nAnd he was right. The spell brought his soul back to his restored body. Callie and Kilmorn were overjoyed but also rather awkward, as was Pekeski himself. Kilmorn was about to take him aside and explain the situation, but all thoughts of love triangles went out the window; the virtual DM had called for a random event, and this one turned out to be another pivot-point. \n\nA booming voice shook the mountain. \"TSETHEM. YOUR TIME HAS COME.\" A planar rift opened further up the mountain, through which stepped a vast army of... \n\nTiseo. A mass of individuals looking exactly like the burned, eyeless villain. They swarmed down the volcano towards the Tsethem, who rallied the remaining Aasimar forces to fight back. \n\nBut it was no use. Despite the Tsethem fighting valiantly, Tiseo had become too powerful. Each one was CR 13, and with roughly three hundred all working in unison it was a miracle they even survived. The holy warriors were wiped out, and the Tsethem decided to retreat soon after. \n\nOnly to find out they couldn't. Della's plane-hopping spell wasn't working. Neither was Turf's, nor Flamer's. \n\nYou see, the ruler of a plane can mentally close off their kingdom to disallow planar travel to and from it. What defines the ruler for this purpose is rather loose, but it essentially boils down to \"the most powerful being on the plane who claims the title\". Tirkosu had never been plane-locked until now, so someone more powerful than the Tsethem had declared themselves ruler. And they were about to reveal themselves to the world.\n\nThe Tsethem watched in horror as a gigantic claw reached up over the volcano's rim. The rocks quaked as a huge, whiskered snout rose from the crater, followed by another, then another still until five massive dragon heads stared down at them from on high. One for each prime element, and the middle cloaked in shadows. \n\nTiamat's roar reached every corner of the island. The living weapon had returned. \n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\nLooking back, it was less of a war and more of a single battle, really. But that was all it took to wipe a race out, when it had power players like Sterling fighting in it.",

        "text": "In the month of Duscar, on the 29th day.\n\nAs I sit writing this, next to the glow of the dying campfire, I am ill at ease. Back home, in the Harbor, I am comfortable. I make a modest living, and know my place in the world. Out here? Everything’s topsy-turvy, and violence is the order of the day. Magic was ever meant to serve man, not to be used for destruction! And yet, that is what my mage craft has been shown to be: A weapon with many shapes, and one singular purpose. I will recount the day’s events, both for record’s sake, and to occupy my restless thoughts.    \n\nWhen I finished my last entry, two days prior, we were in the carriage on the road to the open country, southwest of Candlelight Harbor. None use these roads save rangers, foragers, hunters, and outlanders, so the trail was lonely, though decently maintained. As the sun was high in the sky, I inquired with some of my companions about their personal lives. Vorogoth was guarded, informing me that he hailed from an area near Port McPort, a rather eyebrow-raising name for a major shipping destination. He didn’t go into much further detail, only stating that his mentor had been requested as a member of this unit. After an accident had crippled her, she had sent him in her stead.\n\nSister Astrid was similarly resistant to my attempts at conversation, though this may be due to her personality, rather than any effort to remain secretive. Her answers to any question rarely register above a whisper, and never more than a sentence. It strikes me as I write this that her conservation of words may be due to her profession; I recall reading in a tome about the practices of monastic traditions that certain sects of Hel worshipers practice the “Silence of the Grave”, a respectful absence of words while attending to the hallowed dead in their halls. Although I may not respect her deity, I do respect Astrid. Her efforts saved my friend’s life within the day of my writing this, which I will elaborate upon further in this account.\n\nAfter a few hours on the road, Gideon gave up the reins to Torinn, and went to sleep in the carriage. The carriage had its top removed after the first hour, so the vehicle resembled more of an open wagon. Vorogoth and Torinn had both expressed gratefulness for the room to stretch. As dusk approached, I maintained my position at the front of the wagon, when Torinn brought us to a halt: A large tree had been felled before us, preventing us from moving any further.\n\nAlthough I was not terribly experienced, as I have pointed out before in this journal, I have read countless stories that describe such a scenario as a prelude to an ambush. My peers had apparently also gotten this idea in their heads, as we all put hands to weapons and wands. Nobody moved as we waited with baited breath, but the ambush we were expecting never came. After a handful of tense heartbeats further, Torinn and Vorogoth jumped off the carriage to attempt to move the tree. \n\nAs they argued about whether to use a fulcrum and lever to move the mighty redwood, or to shatter it into firewood with axes, I climbed out of the carriage myself, accompanied by Astrid. Gideon, now awakened, watched our backs with crossbow drawn as we set about our separate tasks: Astrid tended to the horses, making sure they were fed, watered, and maintained, while I sketched a summoning circle in the dust with a bit of stick. I felt Gideon’s eyes on me as I worked at my ritual. I get the feeling he doesn’t like mages very much, though he’s been polite to me so far. I may ask him about it if I feel it’s not too blunt, another time.\n\nA few minutes later, the giants among us had settled on Torinn’s idea of using axes to carve a section into firewood, and we would move off the road to camp tonight. The sun’s light was just starting to fade as they bantered, so the idea of traveling further was not a popular one. Finishing my spell, I summoned my familiar, a hawk that I fondly refer to as Kain, and sat cross-legged in the carriage while I saw through his eyes. Soaring high above the treeline, I enjoyed the sensation of feeling above it all, lighter than air and in command of the skies. I watched as Kain obeyed my mental orders, darting through the trees looking for enemies as we established a perimeter. Satisfied that we were alone for now, I returned to my senses. Kain landed in a tree-preening himself in a way that suggested he was most pleased with himself. \n\nMaking camp as the stars became visible, Gideon and Vorogoth went hunting. Meat for dinner would be most welcome. Having spent my whole life residing in a tavern, I have learned the trade of a chef by both volition and necessity. A set of kitchen knives are the only blades that I consider myself proficient with, so I set to work sharpening them in anticipation of their return. An hour passed, and I heard a far-off noise that reminded me of the noise on the beach; Vorogoth’s pistol had a signature retort. I kept my eyes peeled in case he was in trouble, but my vigilance was unnecessary. He had shot a ten-point buck, and thus we had venison for the evening. Lest I neglect to mention, my own familiar contributed to the evening’s meal as well, tearing though the sky after pigeons and doves, piercing their breasts with his talons and bringing them to my cooking pot with a proud sqwak. \n\nGideon returned empty-handed, miffed that Vorogoth’s shot had scared off the other prey. The two jokingly postured about who was the better survivalist, but there was no venom in their words. Truly, it was a comfortable environment at the cooking fire, as we all enjoyed each other’s company. Getting to work, it took me a bit of time to skin and dress the deer for creating venison. A whole deer would normally provide a host of meals, but with the portions that Vorogoth and Torinn required, I had to use the whole deer for all five of us. \n\nAfter I had seasoned and cooked the venison, I piled it with some herbs and roots that Gideon had foraged. I intended to make a stew, but we had made a seemingly fatal flaw: We were without a source of water, and only had enough water rations among us for drinking. Fortunately, and to my chagrin, Astrid came through. Moving her lips in silent prayer, the cooking pot began filling with clean, cold water. Those who know me know that I am not fond of divine magic. The gods of this world prove themselves to be fickle, childish, and in my opinion, unworthy of worship. And yet, their power demands to be acknowledged, as their servants bear it in their name. Astrid may serve the goddess of the grave, but at least she wields her miracles in the service of the living. \n\nWith our bellies full, the others set about setting watches through the night as I plucked and cooked the small birds Kain had caught. After roasting them and chilling them with magic, we made idle conversation as the cooking fire smoldered. We spoke about what we’d do with all the copper and silver that we’d received from the chests, let alone the gold. For historical record, the average family in the Harbor of middle class standing may expect to spend between two and five gold pieces each week to maintain a comfortable lifestyle. With the gold that we had been given as “operational funding”, each of us could live comfortably for a lifetime, and lavishly for years if we wished. We laughed and joked about bringing Udeyon’s technological and magical progress to the shores of the new world, and it’s something that I can honestly see myself doing some day in the future. But, back to the account.\n\nI was not selected for watch that evening, so I retired to my tent and bedroll for the evening. I dreamed of the smell of fire, and blood. Rising with the sun in the morning, my eyes opened to see Torinn shaking me with an expression on his face that I did not witness often: Uncertainty.\n\n“Tobias, I’ve had a vision.” His typical brash growl was subdued, frustration and curiosity mingling.\n\n I listened as he described his dreams to me: A tall cliff, rising above him. Dark figures in various shades of peerless armor, and at the forefront, a figure in armor of pure white. Above them all loomed a colossal blue dragon, which spoke to him: “So, you survived? Most interesting.” \n\nTorinn relayed these visions to me as I pondered their meaning. “And then I awoke. You divine the future, right? Tell me what this means!”\n\n I was cautious in my reply, as dreams were beyond my measure. “Mayhaps it means nothing, Torinn, and is truly just a dream. Or, it could be a premonition of a meeting to come. The future is written in mercury, not stone, my friend. I wish I had more to offer you, but try not to let this trouble you over-much.”\n\nI did my best, but it seemed like he was unsatisfied. Gritting his large teeth, he sighed and thanked me for my advice, then went to stretch and chop more lumber. Each axe blow conveyed his frustration. Astrid as well emerged from her tent with circles around her eyes, as if she had not slept well. I didn’t inquire, and she didn’t share. Not that I have any issues talking to women, mind you, but I was occupied with my morning divinations.\n\nI assembled my runes as Gideon and Vorogoth rose, heading in opposite directions to the bushes as nature called them. As the art of divination is a mystery to many, let me enlighten any readers of this account to how I practice my art: As the mage is connected to the Weave of magic, so too is the Weave connected to the flow of time. In layman’s terms, a diviner learns to “read” the threads of fate that form the tapestry of the Weave, and catch glimpses of where those threads may lead. The average mage can only alter the Weave in the present, whereas the diviner can follow the threads further. For myself, the maximum that my insights may reach is around a day.\n\nAs I let the runes fall where they may, the random patterns began to speak to me. I knew that if the opportunity arose during the day, that I could pull the strands of fate for better, or for worse. Collecting my effects, I joined the others as Gideon picked up the tracks again, and we maneuvered the horse-drawn carriage through the hole we’d carved in the fallen tree.\n\nHours passed again, and noon approached. The fowl meat I’d prepared the previous night served as a traveler’s breakfast, with hard tack rations for lunch as we could not afford to stop. We continued in relative quiet, eyes on the road as Vorogoth slept. He had taken the second watch, and hadn’t gotten as much consecutive sleep as the rest of us. As my own eyes began to tire of the endless green woods, Torinn’s voice rang out. “Stop the wagon!”\n\nEveryone came to alertness as Torinn grabbed at his belt. One of his coin-purses that he had lashed to his belt was missing. A swift check in the carriage to make sure it hadn’t just come loose revealed nothing, and we all had the good grace to avoid accusing each other. Seeming to hear some sound that the rest of us missed, Torinn leapt off the carriage, swinging his axe around as if seeking to dislodge something under the wagon wheels. Hitting nothing but wood, I was about to suggest he leave it be, when I felt the faintest of pressure tugging at my own belt. \n\nIn an uncharacteristic display of reflex, I grabbed for my belt… and instead found a short, thick arm. The halfling man who had been invisible until then materialized before me, and in an instant the others had drawn their weapons. He struggled in my grip, and most likely would have escaped, had Torinn not grabbed him by the throat. \n\n“Please, I only wish to feed my fam-urk!” The small man gurgled as Torinn’s clawed fist clamped down on his windpipe, stopping all but the most forced of speech. \n\nIn my admitted naivete, I urged Torinn to release him, as he had my pity. We had so much gold, and he was clearly only stealing to feed his family, why not give him a pittance and send him on his way? My lack of experience ended up costing my friend Torinn dearly, and I shall need to apologize to him soon to ease my conscience. The brass dragonborn eased his grip, and the scruffy, olive-clad halfling smiled gratefully at me. “Thank you, lad. As I said, I seek only to feed my family: By obeying the will of my Master. Now, Lo-Kag!”\n\nIn an instant, my world turned upside down: An astonishingly huge warhammer slammed into the center of the carriage, shattering it down the middle. The wood splintered, and metal buckled as the rest of my team were thrown free. I ended up face down on the dirt road as I was thrown free, standing just in time to see the halfling sink his blades into my friend’s belly. I cried out in horror as Torinn dropped to a knee, the rogue’s blades laying him low as he turned to face the rest of us. \n\nGlancing over my shoulder, I saw the wielder of the warhammer: Lo-Kag, a heavily tattooed goliath with a lazy eye. He was hefting his hammer again, and with the monstrous strength he’d used to ruin our carriage, he’d make short work of us if we weren’t careful. Gideon drew his rapier with his typical speed, launching a thrust at the grizzled halfling, whose name we heard Lo-Kag say was Tarrin. The short man’s knives whistled as he parried the piercing strike aside, grunting as the tough leathers he wore beneath his cloak caught the stealthily fired crossbow bolt that followed. The loud -CRACK- that followed Vorogoth like a persistent echo bellowed forth, and Tarrin yelped as he spun, blood spurting from his shoulder. A clean wound, through and through. Astrid set about channeling a spell into Torinn, and I watched the scales begin to knit themselves, and the blood begin to staunch. \n\nThe warhammer rose again as Lo-Kag lumbered towards Astrid and Torinn, and I knew I had to act. My hands moved on instinct as the charm came to my lips. “Lo-Kag! We’re friends, yes? You wouldn’t hurt a friend, right?”\n\nI could see the poisoned words rattling around in his brain, and for a moment it appeared as if he’d be able to resist my enchantment. But, I chose that moment to reach out, tugging on the thread of the Weave I had seen in my portents: Lo-Kag’s will unraveled, and I was in his head. He lowered the hammer, brow furrowed in confusion as he wondered why his friends were fighting. The cognitive dissonance would keep him out of the rest of the fight, so I considered it a spell well spent. \n\nThe rest of the fight is a blur, with the other combatants moving too quickly for me to keep track of well: The halfling and Gideon were exchanging blows evenly, the human’s slender blade scoring a shallow stab one moment, Tarrin’s dagger tracing a bloody line across his thigh as he tumbled between the tracker’s legs. Vorogoth maneuvered to fire his six-barreled pistol, but a loud -CLICK- and a fizzle were all that happened this time when he pulled the trigger. He snarled as he returned his primary weapon to his belt, struggling to bring a simpler, single-shot model to bear. The horses were screaming, one bolting at this point, as Astrid’s war horse sprinted to her side. \n\nI took stock of my tactical options as Astrid drew a longsword from a scabbard strapped to the horse, hacking at the halfling assassin’s back. I had never cast a mind spike before, only preparing the spell as a weapon of last resort. I chanted the words, my hands evoking the dagger of pure psychic force, before directing it at the snarling halfling. He froze in his tracks as I concentrated on driving the invisible spike of pain between his eyes, knowing the psychic link would let me track him if he were to make a run for it. A vengeful axe cleave to his collarbone from Torinn dashed any hopes of his escape, though.\n\nLo-Kag sheepishly stood by the trees, looking back and forth between us as if utterly torn as we surrounded the broken, bleeding rogue. I offered mercy, if he would lead us to his master. Tarrin spat at my boots, shakily grabbing his broken shoulder with the opposite hand. “I have pledged myself to the Master, boy. Even unto death.”\n\nThe others looked at me expectantly as I raised my hand, ready to use magic to end his life. But at the last second, I hesitated. Killing a man when he’s actively attacking you is natural, but executing him as he’s on his knees? With magic, no less, the same magic I had sworn would aid mankind! The thought stayed my hands, and the darts of force I had been conjuring faded as my will wavered. The assassin’s last word stays with me even now as his olive eyes met mine. “Coward.”\n\nHis head snapped back as Vorogoth pulled the trigger on his backup pistol, allowing the devoted highwayman to die for his master, as he wished. I didn’t meet any of their eyes, so I don’t know how their faces looked as the shot’s echoes faded. Lo-Kag looked downcast, his wandering eye viewing his departed comrade. I pulled myself together, for at least a moment. The charm was still in effect on his mind, and he considered us to be friendly acquaintances as he muttered and groaned. \n\n“Lo-Kag, there’s been a terrible accident,” I said calmly, keeping my eyes locked on him and applying as much charisma as I could muster in that moment. “I need you to take us to your master.” My stomach churned at the deception, but I soldiered on. \n\nLo-Kag nearly drooled as he mustered a sentence. “But… you no take pledge! Cannot take to master if no pledge.”\nI furrowed my brow at his response. “Well, can we see him to take the pledge?”\n\nHe merely shook his head violently, sorrowful noises coming from his throat as he beheld his dead comrade. I pushed him a bit further. “Okay Lo-Kag, you run and get help. Err, leave the hammer, it’ll just slow you down.”\nLo-Kag nodded one last time, then stumbled off down the road, picking up speed as he lumbered up the past. I looked back to see Gideon making a note of the goliath’s tracks, and he nodded at me as he caught my intentions. We would follow him right back to his master.\n\nLicking our wounds, Astrid continued to tend to Torinn, sweat glinting off her brow as she poured more energy into Gideon’s wounded leg as well. No one said a word, only going about their work. Torinn frothed with rage as he rose, drawing a long knife from his belt. I wanted to look away as he savagely carved his name into the halfling’s still-warm flesh, but I couldn’t. I’m not sure if it was for Torinn’s sake, or my own, but I couldn’t. If Torinn was fire, then Vorogoth was ice, calmly hefting the war hammer and appraising it. Made of mithril, by the weight of it. Torinn took it after he was… done with the corpse. \n\nWe scavenged gold and another bag of holding, as well as a few other odds and ends. After the mood had stabilized, we discussed our next move. Clearly, we needed to follow the goliath’s tracks, but our wagon was totaled. I could mend it with magic, but it would take me the better part of a day. Time was of the essence. We managed to find the other horse, a half-hour up the trail, and that made life a bit easier. For me at least, as I rode it. Vorogoth and Torinn were too large, and Gideon was more used to travel over long distances. It was quiet again, and we didn’t speak again until we made camp. \n\nAs dusk fell, we once again camped off the trail some ways. A deer was hunted, a fire was made, and Torinn volunteered for first watch again. Gideon took second, and I volunteered for third. As the moon shone over our camp, I closed my eyes, just wanting the day to be over. Unfortunately, I would have no such luck.\n\nAbout a half hour into my sleep, I was awakened by Torinn’s hand over my mouth. My first instinct was fear, but the concerned look on his face dispelled my worries. He motioned for me to follow him, and I emerged from my tent, wrapping myself in my cloak against the cool night air. Pointing with a brass-scaled digit, I followed his gaze and saw the glow of a distant light against a rising rock face. It looked like a cave, set into the side of a rock cliff. Sitting cross-legged, I summoned Kain to my side once more, allowing myself to see through his eyes and hear through his ears.\n \nFlying close to the cave, it became apparent after a few minutes of reconnaissance that orcs inhabited it. The silhouettes I witnessed against the cave wall, cast by firelight, suggested there were many them. Their raucous chatter was in orcish, a language I have not learned more than a few phrases in, but I managed to piece a few words together. Victory, hunt, feast, drink. The reason for their celebration was self-evident. I advised Torinn to add it to the map we had carried with us, to mark it as orc territory. Hopefully, when we picked up the trail, we could avoid them entirely. \n\nNow, as I sit restlessly by the firelight until my eyes feel tired enough to close once more, I put my thoughts on paper once again. Hopefully, tomorrow brings a better day, and with it, a renewed sense that we’re doing the right thing by embarking on this journey. I’m finding things out about myself that I’d honestly rather not know.\n\nYours,\n\nTobias V. Redwing, Wizard.",

Michael had started it up in the hope that it would become Orthraze mark 2, and so far that plan was working out quite well. It was definitely attracting a lot of the stragglers from Gokapu into the fold, and a surprising amount of Warforged too. \n\nIt had been four years since Marianne had brought Michael back from the dead. Vanella had kept her questions to a minimum while the dust settled, but eventually she'd picked a moment to ask; why had she been created? Why had extreme detail been given to making her appear human? \n\nThe answer was a weird one, and I'm not quite sure if I believed it. They told her she was supposed to be a martyr. The \"enemy\" (no one ever used the name Valkeesh) had been capturing the islanders and storing them for some sick purpose. All attempts to find out what were thwarted. They needed someone on the inside, someone who would fit in with the other prisoners but resist the psychic powers of the enemy. Vanella was supposed to be that someone. \n\nBut they never got around to it, because Michael wiped them from existence before she could be sacrificed. He jokingly said that he wouldn't have had the heart to give her up anyway, and V'nell believed him. She was just happy to have some sort of family to belong to. \n\n* * *\n\nNews spread across the planes: Empyrus, the Colossi of light had returned. \n\nAasimar and Lightborn were torn, some believing that this was a sign of the peace, and some saying that the end times were near. The Archomental ruling the plane in her stead immediately stepped down, and let her continue the reign interrupted by the planar war, one thousand years ago. She immediately sought a council with the four non-elemental princes; the original Tsethem.\n\nThey gathered at the grand Tharth on the plane of light, the first team back together again. They were truly one with the elements now. Della's knee-length hair swayed in the wind as she floated several inches off the ground at all times. Lundal was blinged out in the most insane costume. He wore a lopsided crown in which sat Nora the octopus, a gaudy pair of winged welding goggles, and a red cloak trimmed with kingly white fur over his leather jacket. Turf's eyes glowed yellow, and veins of crystal seemed to run through her muscles. \n\nFlamer... Flamer had come full circle. He fit perfectly with the image that had inspired his creation. Eight foot tall, intricate plating now gleaming gold, with a chainmail cloak affixed over his shoulders. He was the epitome of regal. \n\nEmpyrus welcomed them and explained the situation. A week earlier her fellow Colossi were awoken from their recouperstive rest by Visrithis, the Archomental that had been prince of Steam until Lund had kicked him out. He'd apologised profusely for waking them ahead of time, but also said he had no choice: four evil imposters from Tirkosu had taken the thrones from some of the Archomentals, and more would surely follow if they weren't made an example of. \n\nHe stirred up the Colossi against Flamer and Co. until they were dead set on bringing them down. The only problem was that they were all at a third of their usual power, due to not being allowed to finish their beauty sleep. \n\nSo they decided to destroy Tirkosu. By collapsing the plane they would be able to absorb the residual elemental power, and shoot back up to full power. Then no Tsethem, no prince or princess of the elements would be able to stand against them. \n\nIt would also kill every single being still living on the island.\n\nIt wasn't an easy choice for them. The Colossi weren't intentionally evil, they were scared. And Visrithis manipulated their fear, making them choose between the end of the elementals' reign or the sacrifice of a few thousand; a tiny sum compared to the vast masses living on the planes. So with heavy hearts they decided to bring down what they had built. \n\nMost of them, at least. Empyrus didn't trust the steam Archomental's story, and she was more than reluctant to kill innocents, even for the greater good. So she had called for a meeting with the original Tsethem to hear their side of the story. She believed the people still living on Tirkosu were worth it, even if she was killed in the process. \n\nThey didn't kill her, of course. They explained the situation about the evil reign of the Archomentals, the harmony that had come after their eradication, and their own willingness to abdicate in favor of the Colossi (even Lundal agreed it was the right thing to do, though somewhat reluctantly). Empyrus was overjoyed, but also worried. Visrithis had riled her brothers and sisters up so badly against them that they might not have a chance to explain themselves. \n\nIt was when Empyrus refused to come along to help smooth things over that it really clicked: the Colossi weren't going to listen to them. Empyrus realized that, and she didn't want to be part of the inevitable fight. So instead Della gathered the rest of the Tsethem from Tirkosu to take the fight to the Primordials. \n\nThey plane hopped to the plane of dust, which was where the Colossi and Visrithis were hiding out. Empyrus was right; the Colossi were too fired up to talk things out. A massive battle took place, elemental protectors vs elemental embodiment. The Colossi and Visrithis gave no quarter and neither did the Tsethem. When the dust cleared a little bit (it never truly clears on the plane of dust) the only Primordial left standing was the Colossi of fire, who Flamer had managed to restrain. The Colossi of smoke had fled halfway through the battle. The rest of them, Visrithis included, had been slain. \n\nFlamer explained to Ignamix, the fire Colossi, that the Tsethem posed no threat. He abdicated there and then, and the action earned Ignamix's trust. The new ruler of the fire plane apologized on behalf of his fellow Primordials, and over the next week worked with Empyrus to bring the Colossi of smoke to his senses. \n\nOnce again, the Tsethem had averted the end of their island home. But the virtual DM couldn't let sleeping dragons lie, so to speak. Not one year after the three remaining Colossi had taken up their thrones again, a problem reared it's head on Tirkosu. A problem that would forever change the lives of those it affected.\n\nThe Warforged started malfunctioning. \n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\nThis was a bit of a short one. I actually have the next chapter written (and boy, is it a smasher), but I'm going to pace it out because I'm annoying like that. [:3]",

        "text": "In the month of Duscar, on the 28th day.\n\nI suspect that the task that my new companions and I have undertaken is one that will not only be fraught with peril, but may also bring some new discoveries about this continent of Lyeron yet unknown. So, I have begun this journal. Should our ragtag group succeed in our task and return to Candlelight Harbor as heroes, then this shall serve most useful for a chronicle of our efforts. If we should fail… Well, then should my body ever be recovered, there will be at least some record of our mission. If some ink smudges make certain words illegible, you will have to forgive me. I’m writing this in atop of a carriage on a bumpy road, going farther away from the Harbor than I have ever been before. My hand is not at its steadiest.\n\nOne familiar with me may know that last month, I joined the Harbor Militia as a scout. I have little skill at arms, and do not delude myself into thinking that I can protect my town with a blade and armor. However, I have been studying magecraft in secret since the age of fifteen, and consider myself a passable cook. Let Torinn wield a great axe, and I shall keep him and the other militiamen safe from unseen enemies, as well as heartily fed.\n\nAs furtive as I am with my magic, many of my fellows in the barracks don’t even know that I practice magerie. Which is why it surprised me when my commanding officer approached me two days ago with a letter of invitation from the Council. I was summoned to a meeting, to occur two days hence, concerning the defense of our colony. At the time of this writing, the Divinity Citadel, the only great city on Lyeron, has cut off diplomatic relations with us over taxation disputes two months ago, and our town has had monster and beast attacks increase in frequency even before that. With no other towns or cities to speak of on this continent, overseas trade with the old-world continent, Udeyon, has kept our ailing port town afloat. \n\n Perplexed by the invitation, I made my way across town to the Gilded Rose, to consult my brother Marko about it. Any who may be reading this and are unfamiliar with my family, the Redwings run the best tavern in the Harbor. I may be biased, but it’s objectively a good little inn.\n\n My reasoning for seeking Marko out was that, with his connections in trade, that he may have heard something. My brother helps my mother run the Rose, and has been the “man of the house” since father died. He was as in the dark as I, but knew that the Council had been very secretive about its overseas commercial ventures as of late. Perhaps we would be receiving foreign aid? I could only speculate. \n\nFortunately, at that hour I was in the tavern when my eldest brother, Jayk, returned from his voyage. We caught up about his journey over the previous weeks; he seemed in good health, though his spirit seemed troubled about something. When I inquired, he informed me that the weather on the voyage home had been perfectly peaceful, with nary a cloud in the sky. To me, the thought is comforting, particularly when I think of what harm storms have brought our family in the past. But a sea dog like my brother sees persistent fair weather as an ill omen. \n\n“All the bad luck will spill over at once, just you wait.” He sounded for all the world like an old fishwife telling tales, so I laughed him off. Given the events that transpired earlier this very day, perhaps I should not have laughed at his premonition.\n\nHaving said his piece on ill fortune, Jayk regaled Marko and I with tales of an odd pair of travelers who had accompanied him on this voyage. A goliath, taller than the ceiling of the cabin he inhabited on the good ship Redwing, and a rare beauty of a half-elf woman. From his words, they stood out quite a bit by appearance, though they kept to themselves mostly on the voyage. I note this only because their persons become relevant later in this chronicle.\n\nThe two days passed, and I reported to the address given on the letter of invitation. It was a stately house, on the nicer side of town. I did not frequent the area often, as such accommodations were above my means before I enlisted in the militia. The manor was large, with a pair of guards standing with crossed halberds at the entrance. I am not a mage of profound experience yet, but the high-pitched whine of a magical ward made itself known to my senses as I approached. Whomever owned this place had taken great pains to keep it free of intruders. A splendid war horse also caught my eye as it was lashed to the post outside the house. Normally, a horse is a common sight, but in the past few months, they have become a rarity as disease and monster attacks have taken their toll.\n\nAs I approached the house, I spotted two other figures approaching as well. One was a familiar sight to me, as well as to any who grew up in the Harbor. Torinn, standing a full head and a half taller than I, wearing no shirt or jerkin, only his too-short breeches and a battle axe slung across his back. I like Toran greatly, and we have been friends since our days at the schoolhouse. He thinks first with his blade, and there is a place and time for such people. I have met few as strong as the great muscled dragonborn, of both body and will. Utter conviction and sheer bloody-mindedness are the hallmarks of his personality, and when Toran sets his mind to something, only a fool would bet against him achieving it. \n\nThe other figure was unknown to me, and his appearance did little to educate me on his identity or profession. He moved as if lightly armored, soft-soled boots making barely a sound on the cobblestone street. I could see the hilt of a slender blade at his belt, and I would learn later that he had a hand crossbow and belt quiver under that cloak as well. Gideon Vasher, as he was introduced to me, was apparently from out of town. A tracker of monsters and men, he looked a few years my senior. Human, with tanned skin, dark hair with stubble, and the look of a man who had spent some days on the road, he was ever-ready with a grin and a quip. His wicked sense of humor would prove most deadly to enemies of ours, which I will elaborate on later in this journal. \n\nAs the three of us were ushered in by the guard, it appeared that we were not the first to arrive. In the foyer of the resplendently decorated manor, a servant stepped forward to take our cloaks, and usher us into the great hall. There, three people stood in silence, looking up to see us come through the door. The least prominent of the three was Councilman Ephut Kee, a man of very few notable features. His face was so uniformly common for his age, so lacking in charm, it was as if the universe itself had deprived him of a personality. He fidgeted nervously, and looked as if he had a great deal on his mind.\n\nThe other two figures waiting struck me as familiar by description, as my brother had told me about them just the other day. Vorogoth Stormraid, as the Goliath was named by Ephut, was slightly taller than Torinn. I had scarcely believed such a thing possible, and by the look on his face, neither had Torinn. Pale after the manner of his people he moved with a grace that belied his large frame. His dark eyes were always moving, and you could almost feel him looking at people and objects alike with a mind as to how to take them apart. I’d wager the goliath is much, much smarter than he looks. \n\nLastly was the half-elven woman that my brother had described. Ever-quiet Sister Astrid was as pale as Vorogoth, but while his pallor was owed to his race, Astrid’s (I would come to learn) was due to her days spent in the crypts of the Temple of Hel, on Udeyon. Both she and Vorogoth hailed from those distant shores, and I shall enjoy asking them both about their homeland if the chance presents itself at some point in our travels. \n\nAstrid’s lack of exposure to the light of day did nothing to stunt her beauty, with raven hair and ruby lips bringing her appearance together nicely. Let the reader note that I merely include such details for historical posterity. She wore a dark green tunic, with a brooch of silver in the shape of an albatross glinting against it in the morning light. Candlelight Harbor was not a particularly religious settlement, and we had no temples, only the occasional shrine on the outskirts. Still, I was educated enough to know a holy symbol of the Clerics of Hel when I saw one. \n\nEphut Ki seemed relieved that we had all arrived, and proceeded to inform us that we were the members of a new, independent defense squad for the Harbor. I was puzzled as to why a priestess and a “engineer” (read: tinkerer) would enroll themselves in a military unit, particularly one from an entirely different city-state and continent. I will have to ask them when the time is right, and present my answers in my next journal entry. To be honest, I was puzzled as to my inclusion as well; I am no mighty warrior, or even an accomplished scout. \n\nEphut Ki revealed that he was aware of my wizardry, something that took me aback considerably. How had he known? I wasn’t a registered member of the Mages’ Association, nor was my tutelage with the sage Agrippa known to be anything more than traditionally academic. As I interacted with Ephut, he seemed to display a casual use of incredibly high-level magic, and I suspect that he is a much stronger mage than any give him credit for, being able to manipulate items and people at what (I suspect again) are great distances. I will leave my speculations on him for another day. \n\nTorinn and Vorogoth seemed to immediately begin posturing as to who was the alpha male, which left me cringing. Astrid said not a word the entire time, and Gideon seemed to have been in some sort of trouble at one point by Ephut’s insinuations. I decided not to push it. After all, I had just had my secret laid bare, and I didn’t like the feeling very much. \nWhen I enquired about who would lead us and the chain of command, Ephut sort of just shrugged, saying we were all equally responsible for the group’s success. I frowned, as this seemed incredibly unwise to me, but I suppose that a natural leader will emerge soon enough. Hopefully until then, we can operate under our makeshift democracy. The manor was to serve as our base of operations, so I hope our interactions (which are sure to be frequent) remain positive. \n\nAt least we would have a reliable source of military intelligence from Captain Roxhan, the battle-scarred blue dragonborn who served as the town’s Chief of Military Affairs. He arrived shortly after we did, and got some of the more martial types equipped with better armor. In what I suspect was a stroke of pride, Toran refused any armor. I believe he will pick some up on his own later, to his own specifications, though the lack of armor almost certainly was painful for him earlier today.\n\nWe had each received a chest from the Temple of Hel, as advance payment and equipping for our services. When I opened my chest, I scarcely believed my eyes. The amount of gold and magic items that we received was enough to outfit an army apiece, and there were arcane items in that chest that could quite literally alter the fabric of reality. I am not one to feel overwhelmed often, but the sheer enormity of what I was carrying hit me all at once, and my knees shook with excitement and dread. Handing a mage like myself, one who can barely cast a charm of invisibility but once before needing to rest, a spell that could affect the entire world… The thought of my own inexperience is enough to scare me. I will keep the magic scroll safe in my bag of holding, and ponder my worthiness to use such a weapon. \n\nWe were interrupted in our mission briefing by the Harbor’s alarm bells. The town was under attack! We all raced to the nearest gate of the wall, near this side of the Harbor, to see a group of cloaked figures cackling madly. The leader’s features were obscured by his hood, as were all of theirs, but I could tell he was a tiefling. Devil spawn, it appeared that he was the one commanding the monsters that were assailing the walls!\n\nA cloud of smoke concealed the shadowy figures from our view, and as they slipped away, our chase after them was interrupted by the apparition of twenty or so raiders. They came from the cloud of smoke, as if summoned by magic. They wielded knives, swords, and crossbows. It was the twenty of them against the five of us, and they assembled on the beach head in a practiced manner. Having very little military experience, I stood frozen in place as I saw them, trying to come up with the best spell or stratagem for the occasion. \n\nIt was Gideon who moved first, the blood hunter striking like greased lightning. He closed the distance quickly, slashing at one and shooting his concealed crossbow at another before they had a chance to respond. As one took aim to run his spear through the blood hunter, a loud -CRACK- rang out across the sands. Vorogoth’s pistol (a small wood and metal tube that, as far as I can surmise, cooks a bit of black powder to a point where the reaction propels a projectile) spat fire and smoke as its payload punched a hole in the raider.\n \nAstrid had mounted her horse, I noticed as she moved to support them. She took aim with a short bow, but the sand under the horse apparently was not what the beast was used to, and I believe that is what threw off her aim. The arrow fell short, but it was followed quickly by Torinn, racing across the beach to target the bandit leader. I admired Gideon and Vorogoth’s strategy as I saw it play out: The raider that was shouting formation orders, an officer of some sort, was behind two of his men. Those were the ones my allies had targeted first. \n\nTorinn closed the gap and engaged the hostile leader, and all Hel broke loose. Vasher channeled some sort of energy, I couldn’t tell what sort of magic it was, his weapons glowing with a crimson light. Torinn grit his fangs in pain as several of the attackers brought their blades to bear on him, though in his rage he shrugged off the blows like rainwater and tore chunks into men with his axe. One raider had to duck as Astrid flung a bolt of silver fire at him, almost knocking him off his feet. I could see that the battle was joined, but our allies would be swarmed and outnumbered in the next ten seconds if something wasn’t done about it; there were simply too many enemies to deal with at once. One bandit moved to strike at Astrid, the others menacing Torinn and Gideon as Vorogoth fired into the crowd. \n\nRemembering the incantations that Agrippa had taught me, I moved my hands through the arcane patterns, emerald light playing between my fingertips. A trained eye could tell that it was illusion magic and not abjuration, but thankfully, the bandits had no such education. To them, it appeared as if a wall of iron, fifteen feet tall and just as wide, had sprang up out of the earth at the perfect angle to cut them off from their targets. \n\nA temporary measure, I knew, but one that made them pause, giving the beleaguered Gideon and Torinn a chance to withdraw without provoking opportunistic attacks. I could smell blood and hear the shouts of the raiders as they yelled in surprise, and other sensory details come to me now as we regrouped: The soft thud of Astrid’s horse as she moved away from the swordsman who had slashed at her before the illusion blocked her from his sight, the smell of the burning powder as Vorogoth reloaded his weapon, and the pulsing sensation that accompanies evocation magic. \n\nAt this sensation, I looked to see Gideon rip a bead from a necklace he gripped, a dark amber pearl that seemed to glow as he muttered a word. He had received this necklace in his chest, and I wondered what sort of enchantment it held. “Thanks for the breathing room”, he said to me, as he hurled the glowing bead over the illusory wall.\n\n I could see through the wall, so I saw the blooming flower of flames that exploded from the Necklace of Fireballs’ pearl, scorching the group of men in front of me. The heat wave was far enough that I wasn’t injured, but the blast of thermal air was painful on my skin as the enemy soldiers burned. \n\nOnly one remained when my illusion faded: Their leader. A grizzled man, putting out the flames on his tattered cloak as he faced us, enraged. I called out for him to surrender. “Never! The master is all powerful, I shall not betray him, even in death!”\n\nUsing another spell, drawing on the cold void of negative energy, I reached out a hand, pulling the shadows to his eyes. He fought, but it was to no avail. I had blinded the man. I sweat with the effort, maintaining my concentration on the spell as the raider leader cursed and howled, swinging his blades like a madman at any who would approach him. I was of a mind to interrogate him, but I realize now that he would have revealed nothing. He was a fanatic follower of the mysterious tiefling, to the very end. \n\nStealthily, Vasher put a finger to his lips as the others and I watched him in bemusement. A small paint pot and brush were in his hands, as he painted a large black circle around the raider with a wicked glee. It must have been a magical paint, for where once on the sands he stood, a hole materialized under him, and he fell. The -SNAP- of his bones took some time to reach our ears. This was my first taste of Gideon’s perverse humor, and I feel it will not be my last. I can’t tell what the others thought about this act of unusual execution, but I found it… distasteful. \n\nWith the battle won, we knew that we needed to pursue the tiefling and his minions. The battle to defend the other walls was being cleaned up, and the militia had won the day. Consulting with Captain Roxhan as Astrid’s faith magic (though I detest calling it such) stitched Gideon and Torinn’s wounds closed, we learned that scouts had sent word that they were headed southeast. We took off in hot pursuit, attaching Astrid’s horse and the only other horse in the town to a carriage, and making our way in that direction.\n\nThis leads me to where I am now, writing this account as I sit next to Gideon, who holds the reins as he scans the trees for our quarry. I will chronicle more in the coming days, if I am given the chance. My blood still has not calmed from my first taste of battle, and I fear that writing is the only way to quiet my thoughts. Still, as this account ends, I am optimistic. My companions are all competent, strong individuals, and we may survive this yet.\n\n\tYours,\n\t\tTobias V. Redwing, Wizard. \n",

The four original Tsethem were living it up in their respective kingdoms: Turf was ruling from her giant stone castle in the underground earthen plane, Flamer's benevolence spread all across the plane of fire from the city of brass, Della had successfully converted the Dukes of the air into Hopefuls, and Lundal was now captain of a massive flying Gnomish city. The latter had overcome his depression, and he now spent his time acting as a kind of matchmaker. Sometimes his pairings didn't work out, but so far he'd been pretty successful.\n\nBack on Tirkosu, Jaques Torrem was looking for a way out. The desert village of Gokapu needed their protector a lot more often than the others, which cut into the time he could spend with his family. Tikka had to act as chieftess to the Elves, so she didn't have much time to look after their children. Eventually Jaques found a good replacement; an urchin girl named Luna. She had a flair for conjunction magic and an instinctively technical mind. She agreed to be trained as the next Tsethem of Dust.\n\nVanella Thane became a Hopeful around this time. Her death back in Barovia had made her question her beliefs, because seeing tormented souls trapped in a demiplane tend to have that effect on people. She also found a boyfriend, by extreme luck. He was a talesman, a traveling bard who acted as a kind of news-carrier to the more remote villages. He met Thane while she was surfing, intending to learn the story of her recent adventures. The two became good friends, and eventually ended up dating. I was suspicious that he had ulterior motives, what with her being a Warforged and all, but the vDM assured me that he acting in good faith. \n\nThings were quiet own in Pernep. Callie and Kilmorn were hiking in the hills, and Angelica had set up a support group for veterans for the Great War. Things were generally looking up, all over the island. \n\nSo of course the virtual DM went and ruined it. Tiseo broke out of his prison in Orthraze, and made his way out of the ruins to shelter with a confident in D'Okai. He used illusion magic to pass unnoticed among the Elkore, and learned about the events following his incarceration. Eventually he pieced together that the Elder Eye had been himself; or at least, a version thereof. He gathered his resources and formulated a plan. \n\nVindicus was part of the plan. The ex-Grand High Commander had been searching for a way to become mortal again, after learning from Flamer that Charlotta Veil was still alive. He wasn't having much luck until Tiseo came along, offering to lead him to a captured genie. This was the same one that had tempted Lundal back when the dragon cultists were on the rise. Vind fought through the tower's defenses, clearing the way to the genie who offered them the \"three wishes after you release me\" deal. Tiseo used his charm against the genie's desperation, and reversed the deal: he'd let him go free, but only after he was satisfied with the wishes granted. \n\nThe genie agreed. Before Vindicus could speak, Tiseo wished for the Tsethem of Smoke to be teleported to his patron. Vind found himself hurtling through the planes into the abyss itself. He stood in a pillar  facing a fiery, skeletal being that towered over him. And in that moment, he realized what he had to do to regain his mortality: he had to destroy his patron. \n\nMaster vs slave, demon against undead. The fight was brutally quick, but so, so close. They were perfectly matched for each other, the demon's raw power equalled by Vind's speed and stealth. When they entered the final round, each combatant's HP was in the single digits. The demon ran. And that was his final mistake. \n\nBecause you can never run from the Vindicus. \n\nAn eldritch spear hit the fiend in the back, and he disappeared with a screaming swirl of ashes. Grayson Strell felt his soul return to him, and his powers (miraculously) stayed. The legion of lesser demons that had witnessed the battle reluctantly bowed their heads; demon hierarchy is ordered with the strongest in command, and Vind's destruction of his patron meant he was now in command. \n\nHonestly, for all his comedic moments, Vindicus was probably the most \"metal\" character I've ever played. Think of it: he was the Grand High Commander, he died in battle, returned as a revenant, got his revenge, cheated death with the Forever Stone, *killed his own patron*, and inherited his demonic army. All while looking like an elderly, fantasy batman. \n\nHe didn't particularly want a demon army, so he just sort of dismissed them before sending himself back to Tirkosu. He immediately started looking for Tiseo, but there was no sign of him in the abandoned tower. The genie was gone, too. Vind would have probably been more worried if he'd been fully focused. But as it was, his desire to see Charlotta Veil again made him dismiss the implications. \n\nIt was a strangely bittersweet reunion between the two. Both had changed so much since they'd last been face to face. Grayson still looked a lot older than his years, because despite regaining his soul, his time as an undead had taken its toll on him. Charlotta was a completely different race, having been resurrected as a half-orc by Flamer. Seeing each other made them happy, but it also brought attention to how much had changed. And how much could never be reversed. \n\n* * *\n\nFive years after the fall of Orthraze. \n\nPeople were disappearing. Golath and Elkore seemed to be the primary targets, but there were a few Gnomes and Dwarves too. They all had something in common: they had innate magical abilities. The pattern was there, but it was very faint to most people. Not so to Naliko Lakumathala. \n\nThe youngest Tsethem stalked a few magic users until she witnessed the kidnapping of one; and the culprits were Mirlings. Winterbrough tracked them back to a tunnel leading deep underground, but she told him to stay on the surface while she pursued them further; the Dark Mirror was no place for a wolf. \n\nAhh... This hurts to write about. Things went south, and badly. Naliko stumbled into a much bigger Mirling party than she was prepared to deal with, and was forced to flee deeper in the cave. The Dark Mirror is a lot harder to navigate than the surface of the island, and she was soon hopelessly lost. Eventually she ran out of luck. A small bunch of Mirling bandits attacked her, and killed her. \n\nNaliko Icestalker Lakumathala died miles from her home, alone and scared. Her glaive, Black Icicle, eventually wound up in the hands of Tiseo. He was living in the Mirling capital, amassing magical energy for one big coup. When he heard the new that Naliko had fallen to his warriors, he smiled; the Tsethem were not invincible, after all. \n\nIt was at this point that I truly started to hate Tiseo. \n\nWinterbrough was discovered, starved and frozen to death on the mountainside. He'd refused to leave the tunnel entrance Naliko had disappeared down. A statue stands in that spot today, in memory of the wold who waited. \n\nThis made a few more of Tirkosu's heroes realize that something was wrong. They formed a party and descended into the Dark Mirror. From memory, there was Callie, Kilmorn, Jaques, Tikka, Pekeski, Angelica, and Jaques' apprentice Luna Lightstep. \n\nThe Dark Mirror is what would happen if someone crossed the underdark and the shadowfell. It's a hideous place that would send heroes of lesser fortitude out of their minds. Everything wants to kill you down there. There's a theory that a new plane can only be created when all the elements combined are channeled into it; including Shadow. The Colossi wanted the Tirkosu to be a safe haven, so they buried that particular region. And with the horrors the party found on that trek, the theory seems perfectly plausible. \n\nThey were attacked by Black Puddings, and one killed Angelica Mayvern.  It was a sudden as that, one critical hit and she was dead. The half-vampire that had slain Strahd Von Zarovitch, gone. I was playing on the ferry at the time. I didn't have a bunk, so D&amp;D was my way of keeping awake. But after that, I was too crushed to play further. Two of my favorite characters had died in the same week. It really highlighted how fragile these characters were; yes, they had incredible powers. Yes, they'd faced insane odds and won. But they were still mortal. One turn of fate, and they were gone. \n\n* * *\n\nTiseo was still disguised when they broke through what little defense remained of the city. They never even had a chance to understand who it was they were facing, before he ran like the wind. They returned to the surface with heavy hearts, but satisfied that the threat had been neutralised.\n\nThey couldn't have been more wrong. \n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\nHappy new year everyone! I can't believe I started writing this two months ago. I'm only 1/3 of the way through the campaign, which is also continuing as I write! I kinda need to speed it up a bit, but I don't want it to degenerate into a history book style of text... Gotta find the balance.",

Our cast of characters includes a Half-elf keleshite Psychic who is a scholar of the Dark Tapestry, a Human Unchained Monk from Jalmeray with a bad temper and a mastery of Dragon Style martial arts, a Human Investigator from Ustalav who serves as the lone voice of sanity in the group, a Half-elf Swashbuckler ~~former pirate~~ ship captain, and a Half-orc Fighter with a big damn axe.\n\nWe had just gotten out of a jaunt into the Dreamlands and woke up onto the Swashbuckler's ship, and our Fighter, asked the Psychic to explain why his physical prowess mattered in a plane of pure thought.  The Psychic explained in his long-winded and needlessly esoteric way of why he believed it was such, and the Fighter, out of nowhere, punched the poor middle-aged and physically unimposing Psychic in the face(for 17 damage with his spiked gauntlet) and walked away.  \n\nThe UnMonk took offense to this and went to confront the Fighter- she hated seeing elders abused, and was fond of the Psychic in her own way.  A verbal conflict turned physical, and while the UnMonk tried to use her incredibly powerful fists nonlethally and disarm the Fighter, the Fighter whipped out his butchering axe and hacked at her, knocking her unconscious.  The Psychic and the Investigator came up after the two, and the Psychic used Hold Person to try and stop the fight while the Investigator tried to stabilize the bleeding-out UnMonk.  He warned the Fighter that if he tried that sort of thing again, he'd kill him.  What did the Fighter do as soon as he broke free of the spell?  He hacked the Psychic down to 3 hit points.  The Swashbuckler captain strides out and demands the Fighter either drop his weapon or swim to shore.\n\nCue all hell breaking loose.  The Psychic retreats into invisibility to heal and buff, while the Investigator, the sane glue of the party, tries to reason with the Fighter.  The UnMonk, now determined to take down the Fighter, tries to fight him.  The Fighter kills her with a single blow, and the Swashbuckler and his crew start hailing arrows onto the Fighter, who is focused on killing \"the mad mage\".  The Psychic pumps all his strength into two beefed-up Mind Thrust IV's, turning the Fighter's brains to soup.\n\nWe stopped into Razmiran to pay those kooky cultists to raise our UnMonk back from the dead for a tidy sum of 6,000 gp and a \"favor\".  The Fighter's player left after that session.",

        "text": "A little game backstory: I DM a homebrew world where dragons have all but been forgotten to time. My players have been working for a society of now extinct dragons and searching up ancient draconian artifacts throughout the world. They’ve made some excellent allies with the king of the city after defending it as it was surprised sieged by an unknown force. After returning to the city they helped to defend, to find nothing destroyed or misplaced, except a few dozen citizens, the intrigue has been piquing. \n\nThe party consists of an oracle who is rather pessimistic and unkind to any who would deny him his freedom and his own desires, and denies his power as an Oracle because he doesn’t believe in fate or the power of gods.\nA barbarian turned Paladin of Bahamut after meeting with one of the last, powerful ancient dragons, was reborn in the fire of the dragon god. And lastly a wizard who was part of an old aristocratic family who’s estate was burned down 10 years ago and name was removed from the cities records for unknown reason.\n\nAfter returning to the city with a new NPC adventuring comrade, a bard, the party made way to his uncles home within the city, only to find his uncle had made enemies within the local thieves guild after borrowing too much money for gambling debts. The party found their way into a meeting with the organization, The Ring if the Jackal, and were given the task of acquiring a unique stone from a powerful aristocratic trade family. They were told the family was having a party in the next few days as a chance to get close to the stone.\n\nThe party decided to attend the party as surprise guests sent by the king, the wizard using his name to assure a connection to the aristocrats, the bard would pose as a present of entertainment for the party, the Paladin as the wizards head of guard, and the oracle as his court mystic.\n\nThey secured a rented carriage and made their way to the party, presented the Wizard to the guards and showed his familial signet ring, as well as two rings presented to the Paladin and Oracle as gifts from the king for bravery in defending the city. They were let into the party and quickly made talk with the aristocrat, knowing he was of an adventuring nature as well, about his exploits and made time to speak to him.\n\nThe party made their way into his office, filled with magic items and trophies of his adventures. At this time he pulled out a small box, explaining he found this on an altar in a cultist lair surrounded by blood and death, and was told by an accomplice to never to look. The Wizard opened the box to find a small pouch containing a deck of cards.\n\nThe Oracle made note of observing the cards and asked to perform an identification of it, casting Legend Lore. The aristocrat agreed and the spell was cast: \n“You see an old monk in a dimly lit room, elaborately inscribing sigils, runes, gilding, and imagery of each card individually. You see him place it in a pouch and tie it with a string as it travels the land in the backs of carriages and backpacks though the ages. You stop at one point as an old man takes the pouch in his hands and slowly draws a card from it.... and begins to play solitaire.”\n\nThe Oracle was perplexed, he spoke to the aristocrat, “I’m not sure who told you about this, but I have some news for you... this isn’t what you think it is.” The aristocrat was confused as well, “Why would my colleague lie to me?” The oracle replied, “What do I have to gain from lying to you?”\n\nThe aristocrat pondered this for a moment, stood up, took the pouch, opened the top, and held it out to the oracle. The player too a looong pause as he stared at me with my hand out toward him.\n\nHe pulled a card.\n\nNothing.\n\nThe aristocrat was furious, threw the cards on the ground and sat at his desk. The party explained that it wasn’t as bad as he imagined, that if it was what he had described, it was better that it was false. The aristocrat agreed, and was glad to have found out that he was lied to. The oracle had noticed the small stone they were looking for in a display case and explained his interest. He also removed a small crystalline necklace from his pouch and explained what it was, a magic item called a Mind Vault, that gave the benefit of a long rest while taking a short rest, but after using it too often, his mind was sealed inside it. (Though he was released by a reverse planar binding ritual) The aristocrat asked “Can you force someone to use it?” with malice in his tone. “I would be interested in something that unique.” The oracle explained that it was just as dangerous, but the aristocrat said, “I appreciate all your help, the stone I may give for such an object. It will have its uses. I pray not to deny you your intrigue of the stone, as I pray you wouldn’t deny me vengeance.”\n\nThe trade was made and the party made an ally of a powerful aristocrat. They brought the stone to the thieves guild and they were cleared of their involvement with them as well as the debt of the uncle.\n\nThe single moment when I held a hand out to have the oracle draw from the deck was one of my favorite moments of my DMing career.",

During this time I'd been planning out the next Big Bad Evil Guy, who this time was gonna be a BBEGal. Marianne Sterling was incredibly fun to play; she was a psychopath, a whirlwind of emotions driven by a single fixation. Any sense of conscience she might have had was long gone by the time she made an appearance in the game. Nothing mattered to her except Michael Thane, former Grand High Commander of Empai Tirkosu. \n\nShe was the definition of obsession, and that made her such a fun villain to play. She wasn't the gloating villain type like Tiseo, or the unstoppable force of evil like Tiamat or the Archomentals. Her motive, in and of itself, was love. But it was love taken to the Nth degree, to the detriment of everything else. It had become something less pure, and more warped. \n\nAnd she was out there in the vast astral plane, searching for a way to bring back the object of her desire. Only problem was, as Vanella put it: \"If she duzzat, then a heqtonne o' squid aliens are also gon' be comin' back.\" \n\nSo while the rest of Tirkosu continued its time of peace, Vanella worked tirelessly to create a machine that could allow her to pursue her \"mother\". It was slow going, but she eventually succeeded after about six months and many failed attempts (which the Gnomes of Little Orthraze didn't mind; explosions and excitement are something they welcome). \n\nAt long last, then APT was created; an Astral Plane Traverser that could carry a pilot through the weird physics of the plane. Most of it was salvaged from the few airship wrecks still left on the island, which was partly why it took her such a long time; the elements had reclaimed most of the wreckages to their planes. \n\nThane launched her pod-like craft with Elo on board, and flew up into the sky. Day became night, and night gave way to the astral plane, the vast expanse of black nothingness punctuated by the multicolored portals leading to other lands. The vehicle could trace other elemental propulsion engines, so it wasn't long before Thane locked on to Sterling's trail. The APT was fast; very fast. It wouldn't be long before they caught up with her. \n\nThey traveled through the stars until they reached a huge citadel floating in the void. There was evidence of a major battle scattered about the structure. Warforged and weird sparkly Dragonborn floated lifeless in the void. It was when Elo and Vanella reached the heart of the building that they found their quarry. \n\nMarianne Sterling stood facing an astral dragon. The thing was enormous, with wings that seemed composed of the stars themselves. Thane had never even heard of such a thing, but it was pretty clear how powerful it was. She called out to her \"mother\" and pleaded with her to stand down; that trying to bring Michael back would result in the Valkeesh returning as well. But Marianne wasn't having any of that. She said that even if what Thane warned of was true, nothing would stop her from bringing back her fiancé. \n\nThis was news to Thane. Her \"parents\" weren't actually married. But there was no time to dwell in semantics, because the astral dragon took that opportunity to attack. \n\nMarianne turned toward the mighty beast as it charged, reaching out and tapping its forehead with her finger. A burst of light, and it collapsed in a quivering heap. She'd scrambled its brain. With one gesture she'd reduced the majestic dragon to a shambling oaf. \n\nI was rather worried at this; the fight had been balanced for Thane, Elo, and the dragon to fight side by side, but with him out of the picture it was a CR twentysomething enemy against two level eight-ish PCs. It was a fight doomed from the start; just the way I like it. I was imagining that Thane would pull something out of the bag and save the day, just like how the original Tsethem would have.\n\nTurned out, she was owned within six seconds. Elo followed soon after, a slave to his obedience inhibitors. \n\nMarianne chose to keep her alive, which I was supremely thankful for. She woke up onboard the ATC that her \"mother\" had used to travel the astral plane. Marianne expressed surprise to see her there, and explained that Thane was only still alive because of her unique construction; She had been modifying her own body with mechanical implants, somewhat like a self-creating robocop. Thane had a few pieces she could use, once she swapped them out for inferior ones. She performed a live operation on her own \"daughter\", leaving her hit points extremely low. She also revealed that she was now in possession of the reality-changer; and she intended to destroy it, reversing Michael's sacrifice. \n\nShe journeyed back to Tirkosu and landed in the middle of Little Orthraze. She was rather surprised that Orthraze proper had been destroyed, but at that stage she didn't particularly care. All she could focus on was her quest. \n\nNaliko and Pekeski were there to check up on the village in Thane's absence. They watched as the ATC descended from the sky, Marianne at the bow. She held the reality-changer in her hands. Vanella, with crazy dice rolls that could only be interpreted as desperation, fought her way through the remaining warforged and onto the deck. \n\nBut she was too late. Blades tore themselves from within Marianne's arms like claws, which she stabbed deep into the device. Michael Thane materialised opposite her, a stunned look on his face. Elo and Vanella looked to the sky in fear of seeing the Valkeesh descending upon them already. \n\n* * *\n\nNothing. \n\nNot a single blot among the greying clouds. No colossal warships, no alien invaders. Whatever Marianne had done, she had somehow managed to resurrect her fiancé without unleashing the horrors from the Great War. The island was safe. \n\nShe was overjoyed, as was Michael. Thane was... Confused. She felt guilty about having tried to stop her \"mother\", when the danger had apparently been nonexistent. But at the same time, she had also been trying to save the world; it wasn't as if she'd been acting out of malice. Thane couldn't figure out whether she'd been right or wrong, and it bothered her. \n\nShe didn't bring up the torture she'd been put through on the ATC, and neither did Marianne. I think she felt like it was her punishment for messing up, in some way. Despite this, she kept a close eye on Sterling throughout the proceeding months; the woman was clearly unhinged, even jealously accusing Michael of spending too much time with Vanella. Marianne was becoming a yandere. I swear I'm not a weeb, that's just what the vDM was portraying her as. \n\nAnd in a way she was right; Michael and Vanella enjoyed each other's company, just not in the way Sterling obsessed about. Whatever Michael truly felt, he never showed any attraction towards his creation. He still wouldn't speak about the creation of the Warforged, and neither would Sterling. What was weirder is that Thane also showed a disinclination to lean about how she functioned. It was the same willing ignorance that most of the islanders had about the Valkeesh. \n\nBut for now they put these dark thoughts aside, and spent many a pleasant hour living on Tirkosu. Marianne and Michael were wed, and bought a place in Little Orthraze. Thane visited them occasionally. She also died her hair blue, which I think she later regretted. She visited her \"parents\" from time to time, and they came to resemble a real family. \n\nA happy, if somewhat dysfunctional family. \n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\nSorry if this chapter is a bit shad, it's been really hard to write for some reason. Maybe because this was a particularly painful time for me, as my own mother kinda turned out to be evil shortly after all this went down. I think I must have subconsciously known, and was projecting it onto the game. Or something. Anyway, next chapter is gonna be better, and hopefully quicker: We're coming up to my favourite adventure from the campaign.",

        "text": "Master Wei Chi was in the great hall, listening and occasionally speaking to the the South winds. The high domed chamber seemed to almost sing in harmony with the breeze, the nodding trees that lined the amphitheater dozing as if in lullaby. \n\nHis afternoon meditation was broken by the patter of a student's footfalls. He begged forgiveness for the interruption and gave thanks for the communion with the winds, bowed twice and rose to his feet, turning to face a year seven male, Grelleck, the young boy's face showed fear and shock. Something had happened.\n\n“Master Wei, honored teacher, there are visitors in the Grove!”\n\nThe old monk scowled as the boy's excitement chased away the last of the visiting winds, a rumble of wings went with it, starlings and an old owl. The boy scrunched his shoulders and winced.\n\n“Forgive me, Master”\n\nThe old man suddenly headed towards the doors and Grelleck scrambled to follow, but Master Wei said, “Food for our guests. Quickly, now.” and heard the boy change direction behind him, heading for the cavern stairs. The monk moved upwards, a vast flight of polished maple risers enscribed with prayers of protection, harmony, peace, and reflection. The warm springtime sun lit the whole in a honeyed light, and at dawn and dusk you could watch the light slowly pour down or rise up the six-hundred metre staircase and become entranced. Master Wei had no time for reflection today.\n\nHe crested the staircase and stepped into the mass of gardens and fields that surrounded the Circle of Reflection Monastery, which itself was a granite plinth rising like a giants leg-bone out of the earth, with caverns and tunnels hollowed out in the rock beneath the surface. \n\nMaster Wei headed across the outer gardens, seeing students at work, or rest, he spoke to none of them, his mind turning over recent events, sorting and sieving, but no visitors were due for many months. \n\nHe was not troubled. Trouble would not come knocking. \n\nThe outer grove was a stand of cherry trees, flaming pink in the springtime breeze. As he neared, he spoke a phrase in his native tongue and many dozens of spirit creatures suddenly sprang into view, clustered in the trees and throughout the ground cover of the old cherry stand.\nHe smiled to see them, calling out to them as friends - and the birds, and squirrels, and rabbits and more, started chattering to him all at once, of two strangers, come to petition for an audience with Master Wei. \nOne of them was old and sick. The other was young and afraid. Neither posed a threat, at least not that the kami could sense, and they could do no harm in the Grove anyway.\n\nThe old monk thanked them for their help and reassured them of his friendship and gratitude for their guardianship. The kami did not answer, but scattered away and disappeared - even to his enchanted-eyes.\n\nHe stepped across the threshold, knowing he was welcome in this sacred place, and immediately sensed the presence of the other two, as he knew they were now sensing him.\n\nAnyone entering the Grove is always a friend come to visit, or an ally come to trade goods or trade gossip, but none of those were expected, and strangers in this part of the Emerald Hills are rare, as there is nothing but hostile monsters and miles of confusing-to-navigate, endlessly rolling green hills, dotted with the occasional cavern, cave or sinkhole, and teeming with clans of orcs and hobgoblins and many warring ogre tribes.\n\nThese two were not known to Master Wei, but they were very far from home. The dark skin and angular features of the Ashaarian people were hard to miss. Their dress was simple and functional, with minimal weaponry and few possessions. He saw the young one had a crowd of kami gathered at his feet and sitting atop his head and his shoulders. Truest sign there was that this boy was to be trusted. The older one was very old, he saw, and was indeed sick with some wasting disease, but a fire lit his eyes and he looked ready to maybe take on a few orcs before he died.\n\nThe elder Ashaarian turned and spoke quietly to the boy, who then sat down where he was, the invisible kami snuggling into his lap and cuddled all around his legs and torso, and the elder Ashaarian stepped forward out of earshot of the young one and much to Master Wei’s surprise, spoke in the quick, clipped cadence of a long-time speaker of the monk's native tongue, Rokugan.\n\n“Honored Teacher and Wisest of the Ka, forgive my intrusion into your solitude and work, but I have come to you on the orders of a shadow thought long dead. He has shown me much that I wish I hadn’t seen, and sent me thousands of leagues to find your hidden sanctuary.” \n\nThe man stopped and looked pained, and Master Wei stepped forward to place a steadying hand on his elbow, when the elder stranger whispered, in Common, “We are all lost if he ever finds the truth.” and then the elder swooned at that moment and Master Wei quickly asked a permission, received a near-instantaneous answer of \"Yes\", and then eased the frail old man into a seated position against the trunk of an old cherry tree.\n\nHe looked around and saw Han Xu, his family kami, currently in the shape of a feline, waiting nearby.\n\nHe smiled and asked if the Wise One could give entrance to his students, and felt the Grove admit two of his older students; a year 15 named Fenner, who walked quickly to Master Wei’s position and laid down a basket of food and drink, and a year 17 named Ainosh, who stood back and waited, hands behind his back.\n\nMaster Wei returned his attention to the elder man and asked him softly in Rokugan for his name. The man’s eyes fluttered open and fought for focus but whatever burden he was carrying proved too much and he sank back into unconsciousness. \n\nAt this, the young stranger, watching nearby, rose and walked cautiously forward and said in Aqaba, the city-tongue of Akbar, “He never eats, and he sleeps too much. He is dying, but he won't tell me why.”\n\nMaster Wei looked up at him and gave him a reassuring smile and spoke to him in Al’Ishi, the only northern Ashaarian language he knew, hoping the boy knew enough to get his meaning, and said, “He is near to his end, it is true, but his winds still blow. Please rest, and let me tend to him.”\n\nThis seemed to placate the young boy because a smile touched his face and nodded and he replied in Al'Ishi “Many thanks. I would share salt with you and be honored to do so. Wet winds for your help, Master.”\n\nClearly the boy understood him perfectly and Master Wei said no more for the boy went back and sat down near their meager belongings and only watched with curious eyes. The crowd of kami around him had thinned with only three or four cats loafing near his feet.\n\nNone of the guardians would come near the old man. He had not been warned of any threat, but while the kami were wise beyond measure, they were not infallible and he felt a wisp of caution drift through his awareness. That part of him that has kept him alive for far longer than he wanted, that part of him spoke in whispers was whispering now, and this colored his decision to force the strangers to tarry here, where it was safe, where they could be watched, where they could be *repulsed*, if necessary. His eyes darted to the kami asleep on the boy's lap.  \n\nThe Master felt conflict within him. He could feel the discord churning through his essence, clouding his reason and the revulsion of his weakness sickened him, and he took six short cleansing breaths and focused.\n\nThe frail old man was still unconscious, and a quick pass of the Master's expert hands and eyes revealed that there was no hope. Comfort was all that could matter now. He used his own cloak as a blanket and rearranged the old man on the ground, and with a few words, asked the four Winds for a blessing to ease his passage.\n\nThe old monk's mind then turned to this man in his care, and grappled with several questions: Firstly, how does an Ashaarian come to speak his native language when it was forbidden to teach it to non-natives? He was not known to Master Wei, nor had any of his spies in the many places of the Realms alerted him to such a man. \n\nHis mind turned to anyone who could have taught this man the language of his homeland, and thought of no one who would be in a position to reveal themselves so openly. No, there could be no one. Even if that were somehow possible, who would gain from it? \n\nMaster Wei’s enemies were all vanquished. Out of habit, he quickly searched his mind, replaying details of battles past and found no flaw, no risen enemy to torment him or deceive him (again).\n\nThe Master was ever watchful, ever vigilant of the comings-and-goings of the Hills and the Realms. “Strange”, he thought, “how all my time is spent thinking of the darkness we all worked so hard to obliterate. Its absence causes us to conjure it now more frequently than when it was still a present threat.” \n\nHe frowned. The insidious persistence of evil gave him a cold shiver.\n\nThe more he pondered this the more he began to worry that poor planning and shortsightedness had blinded him. \n\nAlarms started to ring in his mind and he thought, “Am I being deceived even now? If not treachery seen, then perhaps unseen? I have stayed and watched. I have watched and waited and it has been quiet. If not, then death and the next cycle, but I have seen *no* signs, no shadows of doom creeping in silently to strangle and blind us. No signs *at all*. Perhaps that in itself is the sign!”\n\nMaster Wei frowned and clamped a firm grip on that nonsense and pushed it away. Hard.\n\n“It will not do to puzzle and brood,” he thought, “I need to act. Could this instead be an ally helping from afar? Unseen? Unspoken? There are a few of those I can think of who would, who could do this thing. Yes.”\n\nHe nodded unconsciously, and over across the grove the boy waiting worriedly for the fate of this old man saw this slight nod and felt better somehow, even though he had no idea why.\n\nHe returned to the old man and rummaged in the basket the students had delivered. He brought out a carved wooden box, opened the box and used the herbs inside to infuse a cold tea. After a few moments he eased the elderly man’s head up and got him to drink, the man's eyes fluttered open and he drank greedily, using his own hand to tip the cup upwards, some of the tea spilling down across his chin and robes. The man lay back, gasping, wiped his hand across his mouth and spoke again in Rokugan.\n\n“Ah, that was refreshing. Many gentle winds for your help, Honored Teacher.” He stopped again, panting slightly, still regaining his wind. \n\nWith help from Master Wei he sat up a bit, and he wiped some drool from his mouth and said, “There is much we need to speak of and I haven’t much time. My name is Elder-Master Ikshir of the Quluthane and over there is my apprentice, Moham, and we have traveled from the Aqaba Conclave to speak with you. I'm afraid much of what I have to say will not be pleasant. Please send Moham away, he has a quick mind and I don't want to worry him.” He stopped and took some more tea, smiling at the taste.\n\nWithout having to ask, the kami near Moham revealed themselves to the boy. Delighted, he began to play and romp around with them, and the kami led the boy away from the quiet scene.\nWhen it was silent again, Master Wei looked closely at this strange druid from the South and waited for him to begin.\n\nWhen Ikshir began he spoke in quick, low tones, the jumbled singsong of Rokugan, the native tongue of the Empire of Clu, and again the Master was struck at how eerie this man’s accent was. He spoke as if he had walked the dusty streets of Mishima personally! It was flawless, and that was what troubled him. It was too good, too perfect, no outsider would ever be able to develop a homegrown bent to his daily speech unless he was born there, unless he ate and slept there! Master Wei’s mind raced to keep up with what the old man was saying and strove to drive this troublesome distraction from his mind.\n\n“Master Wei, I bring word to you from an ancient friend. He-who-was-Lord-Deshthen. He is coming. You cannot win. You cannot resist. You should compose your death poem soon.”\n\nThe monk looked away. A minute passed. “When?”\n\n“Come the Plantings. A few weeks, perhaps.”\n\nMaster Wei turned away from Ikshir and stood. He then paced a few yards among the falling blossoms and the kami of the Grove started to reappear near him, their presence lending him strength as he felt the shock of this wash over him, testing his will.\n\nIkshir said, “He says he is called Dreadcircle now. He says he is the servant of the Unmaking.”\n\nMaster Wei snorted and almost laughed, an ugly short sound, and barked, “I know what he is now. I know whom he serves. I was there!”\n\nThe elder Ashaarian took the last of his tea and leaned his head against the old tree. He said, very simply, “I am an old man now. I have walked the endless dune seas of my home and seen the shattered Pinnacles of the Anasazi. I once advised Rama Narali about improvements to the palace gardens and was honored for my knowledge and hard work. I am dead in a few hours, and there is nothing anyone can do. My part is over now. I should tell you everything before Moham returns.”\n\nMaster Wei kept his back to the old man and waited for Ikshir to continue, his mind calm again, and focused.\n\nIkshir said, “When Moham was a baby his parents were savaged by the beasts of the Dune Seas and their caravan was lost. The boy was found only hours after the attack by some good folk, the Al’Ishi of T’Taan, whose swift horses carried him north to Akbar to deliver him into the care of the Holy Circle of Swords, as agreed by an ancient compact.\"\n\n\"He was looked at by the Shining Light and deemed worthy to join the Quluthane, stewards of the sands, we who wage constant war against the beasts and raiders of the Scorching Winds, we accepted his nomination.\"\n\nWhen I carried him through the circle of our most holy and sacred place of worship, the ancient ring shook with a mighty tremor and all of my order were thrown down and badly shaken. When the violence finally stopped, the head of our order, a wise and ancient druid called Ahen’ichep’ukatt, suddenly cried out in a loud voice “The prophecy of the Codex has come true! The Llanyr is broken!”\n\n\"A gasp escaped us as we stood and saw it was true! The truly ancient stone ring built by the first of the Quluthane was now slanted at a sharp angle and two of the plinths had sheared off and the lintel of the trilithon had dislodged and lay vertically resting against one of its supporting collumns. The Llanyr Aatma, sacred circle, was lifeless and our order had lost a vital link with our gods and with the rest of the Realms.\"\n\nOur Arch Druid, Ahen’ichep’ukatt was looking at Moham with a most intense stare, and spoke again pointing at the boy and said “It is said in the Codex that when the Aatma is broken a child of the Faith will travel far from these lands to wake the Kala Jaandra, the Dawn Arrow, and the child will wrestle, and lose, with the many tentacles of the Void.\"\n\nBefore any of the druids could erupt with questions, the Arch Druid plunged on, saying “I have heard from the Chaos Hunters that female twins have been taken into the Forge, as prophesied in the Codex! They are the shaddar-kai, the Catalysts, and there is no mistaking that these are truly the end times, and the Void’s fell wrath will soon darken all the lands unless we prepare this boy!”\n\nThe old man stopped and asked for more tea. Master Wei did the labor himself, his hands were sure and steady and Ikshir seemed to gain some comfort from this quiet ritual. The cup smelled of mint and ginger.\n\nAfter he had drank, dribbling a little down his tunic, Ikshir began again, his voice stronger, and said,\n\n“The Arch Druid pulled Moham out of my arms and held him up for all to see He shouted, “We show the Beacon his true path or we are all lost! We must protect him at all costs!”\n\nThe Arch Druid handed Moham back to me and said to me in almost a whisper, his voice hoarse with emotion “Keep him and train him quickly, Ikshir, for we don’t have much time, three decades, maybe less. Make him strong and smart and tell him nothing of his true destiny. Nothing must prevent him from waking the Arrow.”\n\n\"Moham learned quickly and soon grew into a faithful follower and defender of our ways and our people. I told him nothing, as Arch Druid Ahen’ichep’ukatt instructed me, and 6 months ago we left Ashaaria on our trip, ostensibly to deliver a gift to you, Master Wei, from the Arch-Druid himself, and Moham was told that he was coming to study the domains of the northern realms, so different from our own.\"\n\n\"Now we are here, and now you have been warned, Kala Jaandra, and now I can die knowing I played my small part in the defense of our home, our Drexlor.” Ikshir slumped a bit, his face draining of energy, his eyes dimmed, and his demeanor visibly paled. Ikshir managed a weak smile at Master Wei, he tried to take The Master's hand.\n\nMaster Wei returned the smile and took Ikshir's bony hand in both of his own. “I thank you for the warning, but I am not the Kala Jaandra of your prophecies. I am called the Prava’chaan, the Archer, or have you not read the second Kaand of the Codex?”\n\nIkshir's eyes flew open. “But how? Only the most powerful of our order are allowed access to the holy kaands. It is not possible!”\n\nMaster Wei smiled and said “I am privy to secrets you could not dream of blessed defender. I am one of the Ka, and know my place in the grand cataclysm to come. Do not doubt me, for I have been to the outer realms and I have seen the face of evil incarnate.”\n\nIkshir, unable to rise to his feet, nodded his head in the most reverential manner he could manage and spoke humbly to Master Wei, begging his forgiveness and assuring him that he would do nothing to interfere with his dharma and did not mean to offend the wise, powerful and ancient monk.\n\nMaster Wei softly, “I will aim the Arrow true, blessed defender, but no man or god can predict where it will land.“ and the master smirked and said “He’s dwarven you know.”\n\nElder-Master Ikshir, 5th circle of Renewal, Aqaba-Quluthane, smiled back one last time at the kindly face of Master Chi and breathed his last in the Grove of Harmonious Reflection, 436 miles inside the borders of the Emerald Hills of Gemseed. \n\nIn exactly 16 days the Monastery would be razed to the ground and Master Wei and his students murdered. Only one survives. A one-armed hill-dwarven student monk named Klemgathed Shalecott. The Dawn Arrow. Fated to save the world, it all began here, in this place, with the Monastery in flames, his master and friends butchered and the face of a former paladin, now called Dreadcircle, etched in his mind.\n\nDreadcircle is a servant to Okotarg-the-Deformed, a necromancer of unmatched power, known to the world as The Unmaking, or The Void.\nIn exactly 27 years, 15 months, 2 weeks and 1 day, The Dawn Arrow and The Void meet.\n\nFor the first and last time.",

        "text": "During a family visit, my 10 year old cousin and I found ourselves on the couch playing mobile games. We started comparing mobile games we were playing, and he was constantly bemoaning how boring all the games were. \"Final Fantasy: Brave Exvius\"? Looks like a boring \"Summoner's War\". There was simply no pleasing this kid, or maybe he was posturing, I can never tell.\n\n\"So what games do you normally play?\" he asked me as he continued swapping through games.\n\n\"Well, my favourite game as of now is Dungeons and Dragons. It's a storytelling game, where I make up a world, and you play a character in it,\" His sparkling eyes told me I had his attention.\n\nMe: So the important thing to know about this game is you can be absolutely anyone you want to be. Would you like to be a brave knight? A knowledgeable mage? A sneaky ranger?\n\nKid: I remember playing Dungeons and Dragons in a park once with nerf guns.\n\n(... what?)\n\nMe: Sure! You could be a fast-talking, wise-cracking gunslinger! Anything at all! I once ran a game for a girl who became a dragon and saved a seaside village from bandits.\n\nKid: I wanna be a galaxy!\n\n(... what?)\n\nMe: A galaxy? In a universe of... Sentient galaxies?!\n\n(He's nodding his head. He's laughing at me. Is he... challenging me?! ACCEPTED!)\n\nMe: Sure, so you are a galaxy now, with your own 9 planets orbiting yourself. For simplicity (and my sanity), I'll say you are the Sun.\n\nKid: I want to be a freezing sun!\n\nMe: Sure you can, in this universe there are suns that freeze and sofas that sing, it's a big universe! So, you are a gigantic sphere of ice. Now what would a powerful sun like you like to do? What would you like to accomplish?\n\nKid: I want to destroy the universe!\n\nMe: Well. For a sun of your size, all you would need to do is sit back, wait, and die. Then you'll become a black hole, and you'll suck up the universe. The end!\n\nKid: (laughing)\n\nMe: So this game could be us just twiddling our thumbs waiting here. Or we could try conquering other galaxies! There's more than one way to ruin a universe!\n\nKid: I'd like to try eating up another galaxy!\n\nMe: Sure. As you turn your awareness to the galaxy, you stretch out with your senses and feel 3 solar systems nearby. One is a smaller white star, still young and burning powerful and bright. Another is a sizeable star with a green hue, surrounded by 12 enormous planets. The final system looks a lot like our own, a yellow sun with 9 planets orbiting it.\n\nKid: I go for the white star! I try to gobble him up!\n\n(I grab a coin and hold it up to him)\n\nMe: Good plan, so this is how we make it a little random and add some fun - This coin will determine if you succeed or not! This is heads, this is tails, now for this attack, I need you to flip heads to determine if you gobble up the system as planned!\n\n(flip, tails)\n\nMe: As you approach the solar system, your planets swirl and crush each other, a galactic vortex of chaos! (he squeals at this point, lots of fancy words) and you are now close enough to consume the star and its' systems. However, just as you stretch out your mind to begin, you feel... A presence? A voice! The star speaks to you.\n\nStar: (cooking up an accent on the fly) H-Hello? Who is this? I'm sort of... New around here.\n\nKid: (giggling) A talking star? That doesn't make sense!\n\nMe: Kid, you are a talking star! Come on, he wants to know your name! What is the name of your star, it doesn't have to be a real name!\n\nKid: Oh. Hmm. Hello! My name is... Jar Jar!\n\n(oh my child how I weep)\n\nStar: Jar Jar? I see, what a lovely name! My name is Eli! I really don't know what's going on around here, all the other systems seem a bit far off...\n\nMe: As the star chatters, you think you seen an opportunity to attack if you wanted. You're nodding? Cool, flip for heads to see if you get to successfully sneak up and consume him.\n\n(flip, tails)\n\nMe: No problem, flip again to see if your attack lashes out anyway.\n\n(flip, heads)\n\nMe: You stretch your mind out, and as your psychic tendrils begin to tug and pull at Eli, he panics and uses his sizeable power to thrust you away, pulling his own systems towards him. You notice that he now has 2 planets orbiting him instead of 3, as one has crumbled into space dust. You still hold 9 planets in your orbit!\n\nKid: Space dust? There's space dust around? I want to create a new planet!\n\nMe: Flip for it.\n\n(flip, heads)\n\nMe: You stretch your mind forth and with an effort of will, the space dust swirls and gathers, revolving and solidifying, until finally it becomes a sphere ready to become a planet! It still has no true form though, so what...?\n\nKid: Now I want to eat this planet!\n\n(we just fed this kid so I'm not sure where this hunger is coming from)\n\nMe: The planet is drawn close to you through your power, and as it strikes your surface you feel it begin to meld into yourself.\n\n(his mom walks to us, looks like playtime is up)\n\nMe: And with that, your character, a powerful ice-sun with a solar system, has attacked another system and partially consumed it, thus growing in power! That's where we'll end our story!\n\nKid: I want to attack the yellow sun now!\n\nMe: Time's up, we'll play another time!",

We're on the trail of a guy who stole a powerful illusion-creating device from the Society and is using it to con a village into believing that he has a \"process\" for turning one type of fuel into another.\n\nWe start asking questions and it turns out he's been conning the church of Abadar into buying expensive Faster Than Light fuel that's actually smelly normal fuel, so before we go to ask around at the local bar, I change out of my Abadar robes.\n\nSo far so good.\n\nWalking in the aforementioned bar, we see another shirren space cleric of Abadar together with a couple of gun-toting vesk. He hasn't been so subtle and is in his full religious regalia. The rest of the party chat to the locals and order food and drink while we use our Bug Man telepathy to chat discretely. Turns out he and his minions are investigating the same thing.\n\nSuddenly, there's a banging at the door. Turns out the local militia have heard that someone's been asking questions about the awesome guy who's been breathing new life into this dead old town. The crazy militia people aren't too happy about this and are about to kick in the door and start shooting anyone who doesn't look like a local.\n\nI tell the carbon copy of my character who happened to be in this prewritten adventure that they're probably looking for him, so he and his minions should stay and help us fight.\n\nHe disagrees, telling me that he'll head out back and lead them away if they're looking for him. Coward.\n\nThe locals flee as well, leaving the bar empty, so we take cover behind the bar and wait for the militia to kick the door in.\n\nFirst militia guy is a little ysoki with a big gun. He steps in and takes aim. I'm next in initiative, so I hold my hands up and try to reason with him. \n\n\"Hey, you're looking for those Abadar guys, right? They went out back!\"\n\nGM tells me to roll diplomacy.\n\nNat 20.\n\nLittle bastard shoots me anyway and crits, chewing through most of my stamina and setting me on fire. Turns out the roll didn't matter since he was looking for us, the guys who had actually been subtle, rather than the really obvious guys.\n\nGuess that's prewritten adventures for you.",

        "text": "A couple years ago, I used to play Minecraft a lot (as 12 year olds do). There were these really popular brazilian servers called \"Hunger Games\", that pitted dozens of players againt each other, in a normal procedurally generated Minecraft world.\n\nThere was no scenario, no special loot boxes (in the beginning): only you, the others and the environment. About 20-30 minutes into the game, the server spawned the \"Feast\", which was a large circular arena with a bunch of chests filled with good loot, and an Enchanting Table, which you can use to improve your items. Around that same time, the server also spawned \"Mini Feasts\", that had less loot. Usually, around that time, most people were dead, and only about 10 players remained.\n\nI usually played by myself, BUT it was common to find teams, who played cooperatively until they killed everyone else, and then fought for the win.\n\nEdit: I know this story has a lot of (parentheses), you don't need to call me out on that.\n\nSo, our story start with me coming out of a cave, with full iron gear (second best in the game, behind diamond) and a bucker filled with lava (yes). The feast's location was announced in the chat, and was due to spawning in a couple minutes. There was also this dude (I will call him Tim) screaming coordinates in the chat, saying he was standing in a hole in the middle of the snow, almost starving and with little health, also no gear. He was asking for help, and said he would team up with whoever helped him. I ignored that, and went for the feast.\n\nOn my way, a mini feast spawned, right between me and the actual feast. I took that opportunity, and looted it, collecting an ender pearl (an item that can be thrown to teleport you), an enchanted diamond sword, and one piece of diamond armor. Also, I found a couple monster in my way, which dropped 4 arrows. Tim was still screaming in the chat, and overall there were about 8 players left.\n\nI made it to the big feast, and found some teams of 2 fighting. I used the opportunity to loot some of the chests, and managed to grab a bow, 2 strength strength potions, and lots of armor. Then, the winning team came after me. I used one of my potions and the lava, but was beaten. I ran away, and decided to team up with Tim.\n\nEven though he was clearly stating his coordinates, I managed to go the complete opposite way. I ended up in a swamp, where I collected healing materials and lots of wood, because I knew we would have to build a tower in order to beat the other team (they clearly had way better gear, and by hiding high up in a tower, we could throw them off while they tried to climb it, using my arrows to knock them out). When I got closer to him, I went past a cliff, high enough to kill someone who fell off of it. I figured it would be a good place to build the tower, since we could try to shoot them off the cliff, if they were stupid enough to stand by the edge.\n\nSo, I reached Tim, gave him some weapons, armor and heals, and we built the tower where I had decided. The other team came short after.\n\nI don't know at what point in the game I learned that Tim was a stomper, a class that had the ability to kill other players by falling on them from high altitudes, and didn't take fall damage.\n\nThey complained about our tower (it was widely considered a noob strategy), and I told Tim to stomp them, right as he was trying to convince the others he was another class. They somehow didn't realise they were standing *right at the cliff's edge*, and I took the opportunity to fire an arrow at them, since you can't move when you are typing.\n\nI missed, but much to my surprise, their reaction wasn't to just go somewhere else, but to **build a scaffolding over the cliff**, which gave me even more opportunities to knock them off. I fired all my 4 arrows, and managed to kill one of them. Despite all that, the remaining guy didn't realise their mistake, and kept building. I threw my ender pearl in front of him, and kicked him off. During all that time, Tim just stood on top of the tower, but quickly moved in to loot the bodies after I was done.\n\nI made sure I got the better, enchanted loot, but didn't stop Tim from obtaining a full diamond set, and tons of heals. We then went on to a \"fair\" duel. Even though I had better gear, a bucket of lava, and a strength potion, I still lost.\n\nSo, I guess the moral of the story is... to never help other players in a competitive match?",

        "text": "The fates were conspired against us this week. Illness, road construction, and technical difficulties threatened our game. But we pulled through and got in a couple hours of solid play time.\n\n**The Party:**\n\nDamien, the LG Paladin - Has taken command of Ismark’s character so I wouldn’t have to hold a conversation with myself as two NPCs. \n\nLuvLock, the NN Warlock - Helped Elvenbeard level up to level 4. In addition to making sure our Pirate was up to full strength, he created some additional personality traits.\n\nMidir, the NG Gladiator - Not much has changed with him. Still likes swording things and encouraging Sir Elvenbeard to misbehave.\n\nSir Elvenbeard the Vast, the CN Pirate - Accepted LuvLock’s help leveling up and came away with the following: Bonds - Beastiality bond. and Personality Traits - Always looking for adventure. Secretly gay for dapper men. \n\nSir Richard Burns, the LN Cleric - The party mom. Makes sure everyone is taken care of. They’re ready to go on an adventure and he’s making sure they have food and can get back before dark.\n\n**The Story:**\n\nAfter being kicked out of the circus, the party decided to visit the Vistani camp that lay of the outskirts of town. The last time they visited a Vistani camp, Madam Eva told their fortunes and gave them a magical sword so they were hoping for similar results. They approached the leaders of the camp, a pair of men whose names were quite silly so I renamed them Bill and Ted. Bill and Ted weren’t too talkative, although that may have been because I was fighting to keep my ability to speak. In a croaking voice, Bill suggested that if they wanted information the party should get some wine for the Vistani camp. The local winery, called The Wizard of the Wines, had fallen behind on its deliveries leaving the camp doomed to drink… water. The situation was dire. The party accepted this mission and, after sending a protesting Ireena back to town, set off for The Wizard of the Wines.\n\nThe journey was uneventful. The party passed some peasants and attempted to engage them in conversation, but the peasants didn’t reply. The just plodded on down the road. The winery was situated in a small valley. A large two storey house sat in the middle of a vineyard with a grove of trees to the north of the house. As the party approached, a hooded figure stepped out of the trees and beckoned for the party to come over. They went, but cautiously. They were wary for a trap. And wouldn’t you know it, more people stepped out of the trees as they got close. But it wasn’t an ambush. Instead, it was the owner of the winery, an older man named Davian Martikov, and his family. Davian told the heroes that druids had taken over the winery and asked the party to clear them out. The party accepted. They hadn’t killed anything today and were ready for a fight. They got a basic layout of the winery from Davian and went to kill some druids. \n\nAs they walked towards the building there was a rustling in the vineyard around them. Six groups of [needle blights](https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/avatars/16/462/636376286057911052.png) rose out of the grapes and started advancing. The party debated fighting, saw they were outnumbered 5 to 1, and decided to run. They went inside the winery and the Cleric locked and barricaded the door behind them. Then they started searching for druids. The Pirate found a room full of barrels but sadly they were all empty. The Fighter went upstairs to explore while the rest of the party stayed on the lower level. They entered a large room with four fermentation vats and surprised a druid who was mucking around with one of them. Taken by surprise, the druid could not react before she was struck down. On the upper floor, the Fighter encountered another druid and two [vine blights](https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/110358/assets/474366/Vine_Blight.jpg?1435178248). In a flurry of blows he cut the druid down. With his dying breath, the druid ordered the blights to attack and they closed on the Fighter.\n\nAnd then we stopped for the night. It was a shorter session, but a fun one. One thing that gets me is how everything in Barovia is close together but no one in the game acts like it is. The Wizard of the Wines is like 8 miles from Vallaki. And they have horses. Instead of hiding in the woods, they could go get help. Of course, it would mean the party has nothing to do, but it would make more sense. Anyway, rant aside, the plan is to meet up and play in person next week. So that’ll be fun. \n\nAnd to those who read and enjoy these recaps, thank you. \n",

        "text": "**I am king Halfdan Ragnarsson, and I came to England to avenge my father Ragnar.**\nMy father Ragnar was a legend, yet we, his descendants, affected the worlds in ways he could not even dream of. Ragnar discovered the way vest, opening a new world for all vikings.  He honored the the Allfather by waging war against Christians in England, created a Northman stronghold in Normandy and sacked the city of Paris held by the son of the great Charlemagne.\nRagnar was a great man, but Ragnar was betrayed by King Ælla of Northumbria who he showed mercy to. \n\nÆlla threw my father into a pit of snakes, and doing so sealed the fate of his kingdom. I came to England with my brothers Ivar, Hvitserk and Sigurd to bring down the full force of Odin’s loyals on the Christians in revenge. \n\nWith the great army of Odin, we carved our kingdom into the heart of England, and during my life I conquered most of what used to be England. To pay tribute to my father, I destroyed the kingdom of England and created the kingdom of Jorvik, the name of the land where his sons landed to avenge him.\n\nI conquered the kingdom of Ireland, where I wasn’t met with more resistance than a few jarls more busy with fighting their equals, leaving them to be easy pickings for my great kingdom.\nMy concubine Bozislava, a catholic woman, blessed me with many sons, whereof my second eldest, Gudfrid became the heir to my kingdoms of Jorvik and Ireland. My son showed signs of being a brilliant strategist and I had full faith that he would finish what I started. My son would be known as the man who united Britain, and through him I would never fade from memory of man.\nI drew my last breath at the age of 54 knowing I had avenged my father. I had left behind a legacy that would stand the test of time.\n\n\n**I am Emperor Gudfrid the first, The butcher of Britannia**. I am the son of Halfdan Ragnarsson and Bozislava, and I created and an empire. I finished what my father started and destroyed the lineage of Ælla the deceiver, and all those who supported him. I expanded my kingdoms to the north and conquered the scots. I created the empire of Britannia in honor of my grandfather Ragnar. \n\nIt is ironic that king Ælla and his rivals fought their whole lives to unify the kingdom of England under their rule, but the grandson of the man they wronged ended up ruling all of Britannia. During my rule I saw my rivals in Scandinavia murdered, earning me the title of “Butcher”. \n\nThe common folk did not see the greater good. The common folk did not see the benefit of a single ruler of Scandinavia and Britannia. The common folk are idiots. \n\nThe kings of Sweden and Denmark swore fealty to me, their emperor. Some holdouts where my emperorship wasn’t accepted existed, but the majority of Scandinavia would pass down to my heir.\n\nI married four times, but no love was as great as the love I had for my second wife Grasus, the priestess.  She blessed me with two sons and two daughters. My favorite was always Halfdan, named after his grandfather. Halfdan would inherit me, and he would be the man to finally unite Scandinavia. He would be the one to create an empire strong enough to almost rival that of the Basileus and the Holy Roman Emperor. My beloved son Halfdan would be their equal. \n\nI am not sure if I made it to Valhalla, for I did not die in battle. I died from gout, at the age of 67. With my last breath I pleaded to Thor to let me into valhalla for the battles I had won in my youth. Despite the uncertainty of my afterlife I died in peace, knowing Halfdan would have an easy succession. \n\n\n**I am Emperor Halfdan the strong.** I was blessed with genius intellect, ambitiousness and great martial prowess. I was handed the emperorship of Britannia, and the kings of Sweden, Norway and Denmark paid me tribute. I was among the greatest men to walk the earth.\n\nDuring my rule I solidified my hold of all of Britain, crushed the last of the Scandinavian jarls refusing to bend the knee, and I got a foothold in northern continental Europe.\n\nI could have done so much more, if it weren’t for my idiot wife, and my useless son. \n\nI married young, to a woman name Astrid. She was beautiful, but not deserving of my greatness. I fell for her beauty, and married her against the will of my father while he still drew breath. Looking back, I realized she was fully average. A suitable wife for a peasant, or at most a jarl. I curse her name to this day, for she cursed me with a mediocre son. I burnt her at the stake at the age of 23, and married someone more suited for my stature. My second wife, Tekay, bore me such wonderful children. Rögnvaldr the genius, Eilif the clerk and Hjalmar the strong. \nOh how I wished Rögnvaldr would inherit, and with the support of his brothers rule the empire of Britannia to a new golden age. How I wished Gudfrid was never born. \n\nGudfrid, the mediocre son.\n\nGudfrid was the heir to the empire of Britannia according to Danelaw, and against my hopes and wished, Gudfrid lived. Gudfrid lived an average childhood, taught by acceptable mentors and raised in court. Gudfrid had none of my genius, none of my strength, and none of my love. Gudfrid was my mediocre son.\nI joined the fellowship of Hel, begging Loki to help me where Odin had failed. I begged Loki to kill my firstborn so Rögnvaldr could inherit, but I was not granted my wish. \n\nWhere my mediocre son lacked my love, he had the love of the Gods.\nThor cursed me with a wound in battle, and Loki the trickster God made sure it was infected. I failed my son Rögnvaldr, and died at the age of 52. The glorious kingdom my grandfather had carved in honor of Ragnar Lothbrok, the Empire my father left me. All in the hands of my firstborn son.\nMy mediocre son. \n\n\n**I am Gudfrid, and I was the mediocre son to a great man.** \n\nMy father held little love for me, and I don’t blame him for that. I was an average student, I was an average combatant and I was an average son. However, if my father hadn’t despised me so, I would never had become the man I am to day.\n\nEvery decision I made for the first 50 years of my life were to prove my father wrong. I would not be known as the ruin of Britannia. I refused to be remembered as the mediocre son. \nThe mediocre son of the emperor of Britain, the uniter of Denmark and Sweden under the Britannian viking banner. The great viking Halfdan. \n\nI was left an empire in shambles. My vassal kings and jarls would had expected Rögnvaldr to inherit the emperorship, and if I’m being honest, so did I. I would had been a great jarl, a decent king, but emperorship was beyond my skills.\n\nAt the rare moments when my father was kind to me, he said I was blessed by the Gods, and that was the only thing that made me accept the challenge. The Gods had put me on this throne, and I would not dishonor the Gods by failing them.\n\nConsidering how the Gods were responsible of my emperorship, I thought it only appropriate to honor all of them. \nI made it my great goal to reform the Viking religion, making those who worshipped the allfather safe under the Britannian banner. \n\nIt was an idiotic goal. It was a goal that asked me to wage war against the great empire of Middle Francia, who as many troops as I did. It was also a war that left me open to aggression from my Rus rivals in the east, and the other sons of Charlemagne in the south. \n\nYet somehow I triumphed.\n\nThe Viking faith was now openly practiced in all of Britannia and Scandinavia, and it was seen to be an equal religion to that of Christendom. No viking would have to bow down to a christian king anymore, and no viking would have to change his religion to appease a foreign conqueror.\n\nThe mediocre son I was would had been ecstatic with this, and seen it as a great addition the legacy of my forefathers.\n\nBut I was no longer the mediocre son.\n\nI had paid tribute to the Allfather by defending the Viking faith, but I had another God to thank for my position in life as well.\n\nLoki, the trickster, and Hel, the Goddess of death. I had Loki to thank for infecting my father’s wound, and Hel for accepting my father before he could send me to her.\n\nI figured Loki would be pleased if I joined the fellowship of Hel, directly opposing the Allfather. The irony of the head of the Viking religion, me, also being the head of the fellowship of Hel would make the trickster overjoyed.\nSomehow, this played out in my favor and none of my Gods revoked their favor.\n\nThis became abundantly clear when Cleopatra asked to join my court. \n\nCleopatra, the most significant person in my life, first approached me when I was almost ready to be content in life. \nShe came all the way from Egypt, and if I had to bet I would guess Loki sent her. Cleopatra claimed to know the secret to eternal life, and I was willing to listen. \n\nHad I been my departed brother, Rögnvaldr the genius, I would had been intelligent enough to not listen. Thinking back I realize my chances of survival were low. \n\nI was not Rögnvaldr the genius. I was Gudfrid, the mediocre son, and despite my accomplishments the despise of my father still pushed me to do more.\n\nI risked my life many times over, and was rewarded with a life safe from age. I can still die from wounds and illness, but age can not kill me.\n\nWith my newfound eternal life, I created the sister empire of Scandinavia, conquered all of France, and I control the coast from Bretagne to Finland. I say this in a sentence, because it did not take a big part of my life. It has not defined my life, and it has not been my crowning achievement.\n\nI do not know what my crowning achievement is. \n\nI am now 154 years old, and I am the emperor of Britannia and Scandinavia. I rule over France, Frisia, Saxony and Pomerania. \n\nI have 242 direct descendants, and I am tutoring my grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grandson in matters of the court. I have outlived all my sons, and most of my grandsons.\n\nI have summoned an old God, and I have slain him in honor of the Allfather, Loki and Hel alike. \nI have defeated the crusades of the pope, and I have lead holy wars against all who oppose my Gods. \nYet I live. The mediocre son of a king. The average man who became the greatest emperor.\n",

        "text": "Some context: The system we are using is a Homebrew implementing Final Fantasy Classes and Races  \n \n\nSo a player asked me if he could change classes inbetween sessions and I told him that Im not sure how I would be able to write that into the story. He simply replied \"Just kill this character off and i'll have a new one ready\". I agreed because he was set on being a Time Mage and not a Dark Knight. Now the thing is, His character is written as \"A normal guy that just looses it because his cursed family sword is telling him to\" and that he is the only one that can control the sword.  \n\nHere's where the party fucked up, they take their now dead party member to the resistance leader to explain what happened and the Blue Mage told me \"Im going to start to take his armor off his corpse\" I ask, \"Does that include his sword?\" And the party member said yes. So I ask the Dark Knight what would the sword do if it was grabbed by another player? He told me that the sword would probably tell them to start murdering everyone. After the blue mage failed miserably to resist the cursed sword, he walks right up to the underground resistance leader (Who was eating a bowl of oatmeal at the time) and beheads him, head falling into the bowl of oats. Now realizing his mistake, he wraps up the sword in a bedroll and throws it into a river.  \n\nI later added the Dark knight's new character into the story and they all are on the run from the local Underground Resistance. Moral of the story is, dont grab a cursed sword, or you might just behead the leader of a group you were supposed to be helping.",

Sure, more the merrier.\n\nHe proceeds to question every roll, nitpick details, meta game... fifteen minutes into him joining and we all were miserable.\n\nThen, he overhears a description of another players character.  They were Nosferatu-- grotesque vampires.  This character was described as having no flesh on most of their head, the skin of their face clinging to a bare skull.  New guy has issue with this.  Because, he says, the character wouldn't have a skull anymore.\n\nHe points out an in-book description of vampires as having atrophied organs.  Following that logic he said that vampires also would lack all bones.  We initially argued that boneless vampires was silly, and a ridiculous argument followed.  Finally he said he would drop the issue but said he wanted it cannon that HIS character was boneless.\n\nWe agreed.  Then we spent the rest of the session taking every oppprtunity to describe his character as flopping, flailing, jiggling, holding items with his forearm wrapped around it like a tentacle, suggesting he attempt to ooze under locked doors, and saying we could hear the seallike slapping of his feet on the pavement. My character got to punch him in the face before the night was over, and said it was like slamming your first into a water balloon.\n\nHe didn't come back to the next session.

        "text": "Copypasted from my mispost on /r/dndnext.\n\n-----\n\nSo [last time on Lost Dragons of Phandelver Ball Z](https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/7j1j4w/the_worst_party_comp_you_have_ever_had/) Whifflebat and co. attempted and failed to capture a fort full of goblinoids, but also inflicted numerous casualties and made good a tactical withdrawal.\n\nDRAMATIS PERSONAE (the names have been changed to protect the innocent and the stupid):\n\n* Half-Elf Bard, henceforth known as Ninja due to making very good use of Invisibility\n* Dwarf Cleric/Wizard, henceforth known as JUGGERNAUT due to having major tankiness and once shrugging off an ambush barrage of arrows with only one or two piercing through\n* Something Ranger, henceforth known as Ranger\n* Tiefling Rogue and/or Warlock (had eldritch blast and thief tool proficiency so I can't remember which), henceforth known as Tiefling\n* Shrine maiden archer War Cleric a.k.a. my character, henceforth known as Idiot-chan\n\nSo this time they attempted to lockpick their way in the side door from last time while I tried to distract attention to the front gates with sniper harassment. This failed for two reasons: One is that I didn't make clear that I was trying to overwatch for a shot on the tower guards to Sharpshooter them through their own arrow slits, and two is that B Team managed to cock up their collective stealth roll on their approach rendering the whole plan FUCKING MOOT anyway.\n\nB Team manages to breach the side door with brute force under fire via use of Fog spell just in time for Idiot-chan to finish sprinting to their location from 320 feet away and presumably working up enough of a sweat to qualify as a water elemental.\n\nB-Team is sweeping through side passages to the center of the castle when an owlbear breaks out of a side room, leaving Tiefling in a corridor between Idiot-chan and the owlbear. Idiot-chan casts Guiding Bolt to damage the owlbear greatly and Tiefling eldritch blasts it, then immediately ducks into the main hall slamming the door behind her, leaving the owlbear to violently peck Idiot-chan in the face and put her in bleedout. DM narrates that the crew in the next room over hear a shout of agony that for reasons I will explain has become our team motto, hence the AUUUUUGH in the title.\n\nWhile this is going on, the rest of B-Team is fighting about 7-8 hobs and gobs, kicking ass and forgetting names, and JUGGERNAUT just basically lives up to his name of no-selling most of what comes at him.\n\nTeam is holding the side-door shut until it won't hold no more, at which point the owlbear breaks through to be met with a metric piss-ton of firepower and finally fucking dies, ***THANK FUCKING GOD.***\n\nB-Team is scouting the area courtesy of Ninja, while one of the group rezzes Idiot-chan, who makes her way down the initial corridor and decides to enter the center of the castle from an opposite-side door from B-Team, with player-me being dumb and reading the center map as one big room instead of 3 small rooms, and entering an uncleared room and receiving approx. 7 hob-gob arrows in my direction and going into bleedout AGAIN. Another scream of agony and the team motto is born.\n\nI nat20'd my death saving throw and thus come back to life with RIGHTEOUS ANGER AND FURIOUS VENGEANCE (and 1 HP) which I then somewhat take out on a grick that crawled down from the ceiling and which attacked me but MIRACULOUSLY DID NOT HIT ME THANK FUCK and the rest of the team finishes it off along with mopping up the hobs and gobs in the room. Since I couldn't sheathe my sword, unsling and fire my bow, move AND shoot in the same turn, much debate was had on whether to drop the sword or just move into position for next turn as last time I dropped a weapon bad things happened as you can see in the link at the start of this post. Dropping weapons and especially bows is now a group joke, as is a belief that Mountain Dew addiction is making me irrationally psychotic. (The store was out of sodas besides Mt. Dew.)\n\nAfter that we went to the last unexplored areas of the castle, found a way in that would have been MUCH NICER TO FIND AT THE BEGINNING, cornered the boss and won by DM fiat as we were out of time and just wanted to end this.\n\ntl;dr: My char kept using a bow when a sword would have been better and a sword when a bow would have been better, owlbears are the worst news, my character probably has PTSD now, I have shitty luck with this hobby and enjoy it greatly, HOW DO I CLERIC, I should have just cast Bless on the party, I DON'T HAVE A MOUNTAIN DEW PROBLEM, and lastly, to paraphrase Generation Kill once again: Gents, we just seized a castle. That was pretty fucking ninja. \n\nAnd speaking of Ninja, they were the only party member never to get hit/hurt this session.\n\nI love this hobby and it hates the fuck out of me back. &lt;3\n\nEDIT: In case you're wondering why Ranger isn't mentioned much, it's because as far as I can remember they just basically did their job competently and thus I can't remember any screwball shenanigans from them.\n\nEDIT2: I just realized I lapsed out of 3rd-person and used \"me\" and \"Idiot-chan\" interchangeably at some point. OH WELL.\n\nEDIT3: What the Hell *is* an archer supposed to do in a room-clearing scenario, anyway? I was...Kinda not at all in my element the past few sessions. Granted, I was also a tactical idiot, but also definitely not in my element.",

        "text": "This is my first time posting here so apologies for any formatting errors. This story takes place about two years ago when I first started role playing. I’ve only played Pathfinder and at the beginning, my GM would just run Pathfinder Society scenarios to get him and some other players ready for PFS games at Gencon. \n\nThe main star of this story is Grok, a half-orc barbarian played by, let’s name him Jeff. Jeff has, the most polite way to put this would be, a short attention span and is kind of impulsive. Grok was pretty much Jeff in a loin cloth. Jeff’s a great roleplayer, gives his character a voice and everything. But just to give you an idea of the kind of character Grok was, I’ll give a quick example.\n \nOne session we had concerned dealing with a lot of Kobolds. Right near the start, Grok says he wants to eat one. So sure enough, the very first time we fight a small group of Kobolds, Grok kills one and on his next turn, starts building a fire to cook it. Now we’re low level, 1st or 2nd, but there were only two other Kobolds to fight so it wasn’t that big of a deal. Jeff would always do funny stuff like that but only if it didn’t endanger the party. Now on to the main event.\n \nThis story happened during maybe my third time playing. I’m playing a human rogue but since it was my first time playing, I didn’t want any of my stats to be below ten so even though I have a bunch of skill points to use, none of my skills are that great. I can basically do a lot of stuff kind of okay.\n \nFor this session, I can’t remember the main objective but part of it included getting in to a guarded mansion. Grok, for some reason, had bought a set of noble’s clothes to wear. So Grok puts them on and when we get to the front gate, I tell the guard that, “Sir Grok is here to speak with Lord Fancypants, let us pass.” The guard gives us the run around saying he wasn’t informed and blah blah blah. All of the sudden, Jeff goes, “I wanna ram him through door.” The GM goes silent for a second and Jeff rolls either a charge or bulrush, can’t remember which it was, and fails. So Grok basically just body checks this guard against the door and knocks him over. I have my character rush over and help the guard to his feet apologizing profusely. The guard looks at my character and asks what the hell that was.\n \nThinking quick I say, kind of bashfully, “I don’t know quite how to say this but Sir Grok has taken a liking to you and, well, he was initiating an Orcish mating ritual.”\n \nThe GM has me roll a bluff check. Nat 20. The guard gets a disgusted look on his face but says, “Well tell him I don’t feel the same.”\nAnd that, to this day, is my best piece of role playing.",

The apocalypse had been canceled, they'd been able to share their story of Barovia with people who believed them, and two thirds of them had become Tsethem in place of the new elemental princes. It was like they'd met their heroes, and then been offered a job. They were pleased as punch. \n\nSo, naturally, things went downhill fast. They decided to split up and make their ways back to their new villages on foot, as both the flying tower and airship were unusable. However, a couple of them weren't as well received as they'd have liked. Kilmorn had it easy, as he had grown up with the Aaracokra he was now sworn to safeguard. It was both Callie and Elo who drew the short end of the stick.  \n\nThe former got a like-warm reception from the Dwarves in Sovu Vapohu, as they weren't all that happy with having an outsider as their protector. Turf had been different. She was an earthborn, and that made up for her lack of Dwarf. Due to this distrust Callie spent little time in the earthen village, becoming akin to what Jaques was to Gokapu; they were Tsethem in name, but only when they needed to be.\n\nElo never even got a chance to prove himself. With Flamer out of the picture, the magitek wizard and ex-dragon cultist Veetoo wasted no time in gathering her kin to her side. She would lead them into a new era of prosperity, one in which protection was not needed. Especially from a clunky, outdated prototype model. Elo was dismissed from his title of Tsethem after less than a day of receiving it. \n\nRather than moping about it (because \"Elo does not understand the concept of moping\"), he decided to help Vanella find out more about her origins. She was pretty sure that the dreams she'd been having weren't just fragments of jumbled memories, and were an actual clue as to why she was who she was. \n\nRemember that none of the islanders actually knew why the Warforged had been created; they knew they'd been built to win the Great War, but the specifics of who they were winning it against seemed to have been erased from existence. Thane couldn't figure out why she'd been created to look like a human, and neither could I without any context. \n\nIf there was one thing clear, it was that Orthraze held the key. That was where she had been in her oldest memory, waking up as the city celebrated the end of the Great War. Elo had found a loophole in his behavior inhibitors; he wasn't forbidden from showing her where she'd been created. So they set off for the zombie infested ruins, with Angelica and Pekeski in tow. \n\nThe ruins of Orthraze were no challenge at all compared to the wilds of Barovia. They quickly found the place Elo was leading them to: an abandoned laboratory kept safe from the destruction due to it being located in a pocket dimension. Inside they found a bunch of magitek and some inactive, soulless Warforged.\n\nThe fragmented memories started to piece together. Thane remembered her awakening in the laboratory, watched over by a man and a woman. He had a shock of white hair and a boyish face, and she had a narrow, sharp look about her. Mom and dad. They were her creators. She remembered learning how to walk and talk, taught mostly by her father. Michael Thane. The name rang in her mind along with all the kind and comforting words he'd spoken to her. \n\nThey went further into the lab and discovered a clunky spellpunk record viewer. This was the logbook her \"parents\" had used to chart their progress. The process of creating a Warforged was simple enough up until the key component; that being a soul. It was unclear from the records where the souls came from. I assumed they were from the feywild, or from ghosts. Apart from that the creation of a Warforged was relatively easy, at least for Thane's standards.\n\nOne of the notes contained an image of a mind flayer. These creatures weren't native to Tirkosu, and they hadn't cropped up in any history books before. And yet in this secluded extradimensional laboratory there was a detailed drawing with bullet points noting the weak spots and vulnerabilities. Thane, Pekeski and Angelica believed it to be a record of the missing antagonists in the Great War. Elo was avoiding the subject; as the only one native to Tirkosu who hadn't gotten his memories pried open, he was still trying to block out any mention of the creatures. The record was titled: \"Tactical disadvantages of Valkeesh armor\". \n\nAnother flashback: her father prepping her for a memory modification, similar to the times he'd filled her head with speech patterns and magitek systems. This time she was crying. He was saying goodbye, telling her he was going to give her a normal life. There were explosions outside. He said he was going to save the island, to end the war by erasing the enemy from existence. She remembered him pulling a lever, and then... Nothing. Nothing until she woke up under the sack in that alleyway. \n\nAngelica and Pekeski comforted Thane as she tried to piece together what had happened. Her father had sacrificed himself to end the war. He'd erased the Valkeesh from existence, somehow. Skimming through the next few records showed schematics for the device he had used to rewrite history, and confirmed that it needed at least one soul to work. Michael Thane was a hero.\n\nBut if he was accounted for, where was her mother now?\n\nThey reached the end of the records. The final one contained a blueprint for an airship-like device, but one that was so complex that even Thane couldn't wrap her head around it. They read the notes on the design which stated it was intended to allow people to travel through the astral plane. The craft had a bunch of divining magic rigged up to it too. The last entry read: \"ATC launched 1 year after EGW. Mission objective: retrieve Michael.\"\n\nShe was still out there. Vanella's \"mother\" was searching for her father among the stars. But there was a problem; they checked the blueprint for the reality-rewriter and confirmed it; bringing back Michael Thane would also bring back the Valkeesh. The \"squid aliens\", as Vanella called them, would once again threaten the island. They had to stop her mother before she doomed the island to a second Great War.\n\nTime was of the essence.\n\n* * *\n\nSo of course, Thane spent six months trying to build a replica of the astral traversal craft. \n\nThe problem with Thane is that she'll never ask for help with anything that has a personal edge to it. She's all too happy to give help, but she won't ask to be on the receiving end even if it means the potential end of the world. So for half a year she fiddled around in her new garage in Little Orthraze, settling into life among the Gnomes. As a Tsethem she was required to attend certain events, which forced her to be social now and again, but for the most part it was just her and Elo tinkering away and trying not to blow up the whole village. \n\nThings were busy for the rest of Tirkosu, and even up on the elemental planes; Turf, Della, Lundal and Flamer had all settled into their roles as princes of the elements, and were demonstrating that by going on a wild adventure across the planes to kill Orcus. The first modron for the campaign was sighted, but it was unclear as to where it had originated from. \n\nMeanwhile on Tirkosu, Callie, Kilmorn, and Angelica were lured to Barovia again by one of the Vistani. Strahd had rejuvenated as per the book, but with only a shadowy remnant of his head; his physical one was still in Tirkosu, although it too had awoken and was now flying about the southern forests like a vampire flameskull. Strahd had brought them back to his realm because he believed Angelica might be a fitting heir to his curse; she just had to prove it by beating him in single combat. \n\nThe danger duo weren't having any of that. They might be crazy, but they're not insane. They helped Angelica kick Strahd back to the grave, and asked the people of Barovia to call them when he resurfaced. \n\nIt was also around this time that I began using online chatrooms to \"train\" my characters' personalities. Playing solo can create fantastic stories, but it can be difficult to really get the *feel* of a character. Going onto random chatrooms such as Omegle (before it got invaded by bots) really helped me flesh out their mannerisms and personalities. \n\nAll in all, it was a time of peace, despite the constant threat of the returning Valkeesh. The island thrived, and the heroes took their time to relax and enjoy life. Christmas rolled around in real life, and Flamer took that meta opportunity to fly around the island delivering presents to everyone. Thane started breaking the 4th wall to me in chat rooms, and we struck up the same love/hate relationship most puppeteers have with their puppets. It was a really nice, comparatively gentle time for Tirkosu.\n\nAnd it was all about to change. \n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\nLittle bit of a shorter part today, because the current events in-game are hotting up right now.",
