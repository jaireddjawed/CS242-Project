I never drive without wearing a seatbelt.\n\nWill this effect my chances of getting a delivery job?\n\nThanks.",

He proceeds to tell me it's an order for his mom and that he's going to get a slice real quick.\nIt's paid for with a card and I think no problem. Dude gets a slice and I head up to the apartment to drop the pizza off with mom.\n\nIndeed a lady does answer the door and I smile and tell her that her son couldn't wait and got a slice on the way up. She opens the box, looks back up at me and says \"I ain't got no damned son.\" \n\nI apologize profusely, explain what happened and call the store to get a remake started. As soon as I had the customer settled I took off to find the scammer but never did. Probably just went to his apartment with a free slice. I couldn't really knock door to door looking for him.\n\nI definitely learned my lesson and I need a signature or cash before anything changes hands.",

I also almost got arrested becuase I was stuipd and left my little dabbing kit in my backpack so when the cops searched my car they found it along with my rolling papers and the smallest amount of dabs.

In the interest of painting a picture for you, imagine a gentleman of about 6'4 in stature weighing about 240 lbs. Now imagine him in a white Hanes T-shirt, red basketball shorts, and sandals. You get the idea.\nBrandon didn't strike me as a terrible guy, but I've only been at this shop for a few weeks now. Other than in passing, I've only had one real interaction with him, which was last Thursday, my first day off since starting the job. It went as follows:  \n*Phone Call*  \nMe: This is SaltyLeave  \nBrandon *Unintelligible garble.*  \nMe: I'm sorry, I'm having trouble understanding you.  \nBrandon: Garble  \nMe: I'm sorry, I'm really having trouble understanding you.  \nBrandon: THIS IS BRANDON FROM PAPA JOHN'S. CAN YOU WORK MY 3-8 SHIFT TONIGHT?  \nMe: Oh hey, no, sorry man. I picked up some part time work from Craigslist and I'm not sure how long it's going to last today.  \nBrandon: Oh, okay. Well, that's cool. Hey, if (boss's name) calls just tell him you got caught up in some stuff.  \nMe: Uh, alright. Gotta go. Talk to you later.  \nI wasn't done working on the side job until about 8 pm, didn't hear from Brandon or my boss, and didn't bother calling either of them as I told Brandon I couldn't promise to cover his shift.  \nFast forward to the next day, at work.  \nBoss: Everything cool?  \nMe: Yeah, how's things been with you?  \nBoss: Not bad, Brandon mentioned you were going to cover his shift yesterday and crossed his name off the schedule and wrote yours in.  \nMe: What?! I told him in no uncertain terms that I was doing some sidework and couldn't promise to work the shift. If I am scheduled to be here, I will be, and if I can't be, I will contact you as soon as possible.  \nBoss: I figured something along those lines. That guy's a jackass.  \nI'm still kind of on the fence at this point. I mean, fuck this guy for fucking with my job and my money. However, I'm new at this shop and I'm not looking to make any trouble. However, over the next few days, it becomes quite apparent that everyone at the shop can't stand him and are expecting him to be terminated extremely soon. This includes the boss.  \nFast forward to today. I show up at 10:45, half an hour before I'm scheduled, because we have a corporate inspection next week and there are some cleaning projects I've wanted to get accomplished, and it's Boss' day off, so I want to help keep an eye on things.  \nToday, 3:10 pm.  \nMe: (To shift supervisor covering from another store.) Hey Rob, who's supposed to be here at three?  \nI wander over to check the schedule and see who hasn't shown up yet. Surprise, surprise, it's Brandon.  \nMe: Looks like it's Brandon. Not a big surprise, honestly.  \nRob: *Rolling eyes* Good god, we're better off without him.  \nAgreed!  \nI cut the next pie coming out of the oven and leave on my next run.  \nAnd you guys...  \nYou guys....Guess who I spot while I'm on this run.  \nYou guessed it.   \nBrandon.  \nLess than six blocks away from the store, driving around without a care in the world.  \n\"But SaltyLeave, how could you know for sure it was him?\"  \nWait for it...\nBecause that dumb motherfucker was driving his maroon nissan around, six blocks from the shop, after not showing up for a shift he was scheduled for, with a Papa John's car topper on.  \nBalls.   \n  \nStay tuned for my next installment...\"The Tale of the Delivery Driver Who Got Arrested and Didn't Know When To STFU.\" \n",

I do love this sub and have been entertained by it for awhile now.\n\nSo tonight I am a little tipsy, but was craving some pizza. I ordered from a rather large chain (starts with a D) for delivery and started playing some PS4 until it got here. Now, I live probably 2 miles away from this place and have ordered there quite a lot. I live in a somewhat nice apartment complex and make sure I always tip well as I'm always too lazy (or tipsy) to drive 2 miles to pick it up.\n\nTonight started normal. Driver got here and on my $28 order I wrote a zero and filled out the slip for my card, and handed him back the receipt. I did however take a $10 bill out of my pocket and hand it to him and let him know its him for his tip. Everything went well and he left.\n\nNot even 5 minutes later I receive a call from the manager saying I can no longer have deliveries received at my address. I asked him why but he wouldn't tell me. I feel kinda offended as I always tip well and I'm nice. This is my favorite pizza chain and they have always been so nice to me so I'm super confused. I almost always tip well with deliveries being around $7+ yet I feel like I've been shamed by this call.\n\nIs this normal? Could crossing out the tip have something to do with it on the receipt? I don't understand what I did wrong.",

        "text": "I work as a delivery driver for a small, local joint relativley unknown and substantially poor. Like, in the 3 months or so I have had this job I have legitimatley thought we were going to go bankrupt. Our place makes pizzas with fresh ingredients made in store daily. Despite our prices being relativley higher than other places our main demographic is the financially unfortunate population. I have quite a few stories and experiences from the past few months.\n\n1. \"Please use back door\"\n\nWhenever we take a delivery, we check the ticket to see if there are any special requests or instructions when delivering. As I said before, a large portion of customers are not in the best financial situation. I was about a week into my job when I got a delivery with special instructions to use the back door. It was getting pretty late and the sun was no longer out. I got to the house and found that it looked basically abandoned, trash all in the front lawn, furniture piled high on the porch. I approached the front door to see a crude sign made of cardboard saying \"PLEASE USE BACK DOOR\". I was pretty scetched out and tried to walk as quietly as possible. I got to the back yard fence and peered over, not seeing anyone but a large amount of trash and broken toys/furniture. The house lights weren't on either, and at this point is was about 10:00pm, pretty dark out. I decided I valued my job more than my life and opened the fence and looked around, and in the darkness there was just a middle aged lady in a lawn chair in a bikini smoking a cigarette. I was actually pretty terrified that she was a distraction for some sort of mugging from behind but nothing of the sort happened. She appologized for the mess and promised to \"tip me much better next time\". She never ordered again to my knowlege, but there have been several other instances of delivering to run down houses requesting back door service. I get kind of worried every time.\n\n2. Old man lure\n\nI am only 18 years old and appear much younger than every other delivery driver. I had a delivery to an apartment complex on the top floor. When I arrived it was an older man, maybe 60 or 70. I told him his total and he insisted I come in. I stepped inside and he motioned me to the kitchen, which was compact and also a dead end (counters on either side of me and a wall at the end). He then stepped in the way of the entrance, blocking me off from leaving. He gave me a sinister grin and looked at me while counting out his change slowly and making sure to tip me. After he gave me the money he leaned both his arms on both counters essentially closing me in even more. My head was pounding because he just kept staring at me and smiling. I was unsure what he was going to do next but I knew I had to get out of there. So I gave the whole \"Enjoy, have a good day\" speel and made it clear that I was leaving. He moved out of the way as I walked past but continued to look at me, and even peered his head out of his doorway as I walked down the hallway. I would like to think he was just a kind old man in need of company but judging by the way he was looking at me I doubt he had good intentions, but that could just be me. \n\n3. I was faster than the drunk guy\n\nI got a delivery around 1:00am and it was super cloudy out and essentially pitch black out. The duplex I was delivering to had a broken street light, and also a broken porch light, so I had to use my phone flashlight. I ended up sitting on a dark porch waiting for this guy to answer thinking that it was just a prank. I eventually called my pizza place calling it off and headed back to my car, when a taxi pulled up right beside me and a large man stumbled out and shouted something like \"Pizza's here!\". He brought me to his porch and paid me in a bunch of small bills and then asked for exact change back leaving me with no tip. Was kind of pissed as I waited for 20 minutes for a delivery with no tip. \n\nI have a lot more I might share later on. Phone is low so gotta go",

        "text": "These are some stories from when I was a pizza guy back when I was like 16 years old...\n\nI worked for this greasy pizza place for a bit and if someone ordered the works there was a good chance the pizza would slide (The toppings slip off the pizza and end up in a pile on the side of the box). When I was just starting I didn't know about slid pizzas, but I found out. I slid a pizza for this guy who ordered every Wednesday on my shift, and he obviously called and complained. Next week, he literally invited me into the house (I knew it was the same guy). \"So, wanna bet on whether the toppings are on the pizza, or next to it in a pile? Open it up\" He said like a mob boss... I was scared shitless and slowly opened the box. The pizza was fine and he gave me a $5 tip. This turned into me literally showcasing his pizza every week for a free $5 tip.\n\nDelivered to a sex toy party for elderly women. Also was invited in and sexually harassed, but I liked it.\n\nDelivered to a drunk guy who could barely walk. He asked me to find his dog. I pointed to my left, \"He's right there, tangled in the bushes,\" the guy was so happy he gave me a $50 dollar tip. I'm sure he regretted that the next day.\n\nMy coworker paid me in nickels, I ripped the bag open and threw it back at him making a huge mess. We laughed about it for months.\n\nHad to slam the brakes and a calzone ate the floor. Had to go back to HQ and get a new calzone.\n\n20 garden - no tip. 13 years later and I still remember.\n\nUsed all of the cleaning agents at the store. To do the floors real good one night. Literally melted the glue holding the tiles down and also made the black tiles gray.\n\nQuick and easy driver dinner - meatballs in a pita. How they gonna charge u for that?\n\nUsed my bosses truck for a delivery once and he had an ounce of weed in the glovebox. Wtf, doesn't he know we speed?\n\nHalloween 2004 I made something like $35 an hour from tips. Got yelled at by skeleton.\n\nDidn't participate in coupon scam (turn in a bunch of $2 off coupons at the end of the night for extra money when cashing out).\n\nAlways forgot people's soda.\n\nNowadays, I am the orderer. I tip $5 typically. Sometimes more. But. But. If you don't have change I will short you noob. \n\nMe-\" I'll have 4 back\"\n\"Uh I don't have change\"\n\"Why not?\"\n\"It's my first delivery of the night\"\n\"You couldn't ask your boss for a $20 bank? A 10, a 5, and five 1s?\"\n\"Naw man\"\n\"Ok here's $20, bring me change and you can get a tip\"\n\"The order is 21, old man\"\n\"Learn to do your job and you can get paid kid, I'm not giving you a $9 tip for sucking at your job now get lost,\"\nHe burns out in my driveway and I smile dreamily. \n\nThis kid and I have the same conversation all the time. He rolls without change to dupe people into giving giant tips. I would have never resorted to such lowly tactics as a proud pizza delivery driver. He STILL doesn't bring change so I started ordering with a card... also, I know his boss, I used to work there Hahahahaha.\n",

Our pizza order runs between $35-$50; depending on what we order.  I always tip $10 on that amount.  Hubby thinks it should be $5.  My logic is simple - what is it worth to me to not get in the truck, fight traffic, find/possibly pay for parking; wait in line; fight traffic back home and possibly deal with kids/animals/etc. all wanting to come along for the ride.  I could be at home doing other things.  That is easily worth $10.  Also, because our pizza guy knows us, and how I tip, our items are always hot/fresh/etc.  I won’t tip less if the order is less but I wouldn’t bump it to $15 unless it was a large order.  Am I doing this right or am I over tipping?   Thanks in advance for your thoughts!",

I have since moved on and am so far enjoying my new job. In all of my stories, I never mentioned one of the managers that worked there: Regina George. She was one of those people that thrived on being in power. It gave her a high. She told stories about how when she would go out to eat and if she received what she believed was less than stellar service she would talk to the person in charge and tell them something along the lines of \"I'm the manager of a restaurant, and I would NEVER let any of my employees giver terrible service like what I got tonight!\"\n\nShe was a bloody shift Lead. Not even the GM.\n\nShe had quite the way of making herself feel good, too. When I first started, she would take every opportunity to belittle me and it got to the point where even coworkers were treating me the same way she did. She would even go as far as belittling me in front of customers and chewing me out for something minor. If things weren't done HER WAY she would take pictures and send them to the owner or the GM on their days off. She also would deny meal breaks that employees were legally obligated to (ratted her out on that one). It was emotionally taxing, but when I asked to switch shifts to where I'd pretty much never see her, it got a LOT better.\n\nFast forward to when I got made a shift Lead. That meant we were at the exact same level. She started trying to make changes to things (policies, procedures, you name it) and still tried to act like she had authority on me. Luckily, I'd grown a spine and would either ignore her completely or I'd call her out on her BS. So she found a new employee to bully and that was a 16-year old boy. This poor kid got so much crap thrown at him. She intimidated him, would yell at him, and start telling all the other employees how bad of a worker he was. One night it was so bad that I sent a message to our GM telling her what was actually going on and how Regina was treating him. I also had a few talks with the kid letting him know that I was seeing what was really going on and that I'd help him if I could (she wasn't even trying to train him to do the job right. She was just yelling at him). Even one of the other managers tried to talk to Regina George about how she was treating him. Nothing changed.\n\nNow here is where it gets REALLY interesting. GM gives her notice. Regina George automatically thinks she'll get the position and is the only one not torn up about our really awesome GM leaving. Regina George was NOT EVEN ASKED to take on the role. It went to a newer higher with more experience and less of a superiority complex. This is when she started doing the equivalent of the cat peeing on the carpet. That 16-year old kid I told you about? He told me he noticed she wasn't even giving him tips, and when she did he was being shorted. Or they weren't even being recorded. New GM also noticed she was stealing tips from another employee. Not only that, but everybody else's tills were suddenly off, yet hers was perfect. One day mine was a very specific number off (if my tills were off it was by like dollars and cents. This was a rather big, specific number). It didn't take Sherlock Holmes (lol) to know she was stealing from everybody's tills. She was the only person there who truly had a motive. She also began sabotaging everything else. Training newer employees wrong, training the new dough person to make the dough in a way that would sabotage the pizzas and make the product inconsistent with what we had been doing for years. It was bad. She got talked to, and was originally going to be fired...but they only talked to her about the improper training. NOTHING about the stealing. \nIt was stressing me out, knowing what she was doing could affect my reputation too (I was known for having borderline perfect tills). I left and she's still there. I'm a lot happier, but a part of me really wishes Regina George had gotten what would normally happen to any other thief.  ",

I delivered to a house where It was obvious that the parents weren't home. So the kid opens the door and if I have to make a guess he's around nine years old. He hands me like 17 dollars for a 16.18 dollar order and then stops me and pulls a five out of his back pocket. I was relieved because that meant the parents actually left him a tip. But as he's pulling it out, I can see him thinking super hard. Like very, very hard. He slowly reaches his hand out to me before the bill is literally an inch from my hand, then audibly goes, \"Hmmmmmm. Nah.\" And puts it back into his pocket at light speed. After getting over the fact the kid played me, I thought it was kind of funny. \n\nI have a decent amount more stories from over the past year, if anyone wants any.",

        "text": "So I haven't delivered pizza in a few years but I just discovered this subreddit and I figured I would contribute one of my many tales from pizza delivery world. I worked at Dominos all through high school and college and this is the craziest one I could remember. \n\n\nI had a delivery to House 1. An older guy maybe 50 or 60 answered the door and he was confused. He said, \"we didn't order pizza!\" Looked back at his wife and asked her if she ordered pizza and she said no. Now I start to get concerned but it wouldn't be the first time I went to the wrong house so I checked my delivery info. I confirmed I was at the right address and his name was on the order. But he was adamant that he didn't order the pizza. \n\nUsually at about this time I would try to deduce what the problem is. Is there anyone else in the house who might have ordered? Did the CSR get the address wrong? What is going on? But this guy knew exactly what the problem was. He stepped out of his house and said follow me, and we started walking over to the neighbors house across the street to House 2. In my head im thinking, \"oh maybe his son ordered pizza and is hanging out across the street. \" \n\nBut then the guy says \"This motherfucker is playing games.\" Which really threw me. And then he said \"this fucking guy keeps fucking with me. He stole my wife's social security check out of my mailbox. And now he's ordering pizzas to my house. We had a Pizza Hut guy and a hungry howies guy already\" Right then I knew this was not going to end well but I was too curious to not see where this was going. \n\nWe start walking over and if I can set the scene real quick: it's a cold day in Michigan with maybe a foot of snow covering the grass and the sidewalks are a little slippery from a little snow/rain from the previous day. And I'm also in a neighborhood where people aren't as diligent about picking up snow / mowing their lawns. (Speaks to the character of the people involved in what's about to happen)\n\nSo I follow this guy over to the door of House 2 and this tall skinny dude maybe 19 or 20 years old answers the door. Immediately I could sense the tension and knew the situation was not going to be pleasant. The old guy from House 1 starts screaming and bitching him out saying \"you better stop ordering pizza to my house\" and \" I know you stole my check asshole!\" The kid is just yelling back things like \"You're crazy!\" and \"Get the hell off my property!\" \n\nAt this point I realized that I'm probably not going to get paid for this pizza. So I start backing up and out of this conflict but I couldn't look away. Things were heating up and I wanted to hang out and see what happened. \n\nThats when the magic words every man recognizes were uttered. \"I'll kick your fucking ass right here,\" said the old man owner of house 1. The kid stepped out from behind his screen door and did the ol 'yea what are you gonna do move and stuck his chest and face right into the old mans. Then the old man threw a sort of halfhearted punch/push and this kid dodged it and starts wailing on the old man. He threw a quick one-two and the old man started stumbling backwards and lost his balance in the snow but he got back up and rushed him. Probly not a good move cuz the kid caught him with a couple more, but I admired the old man's tenacity. \n\nI was struggling with whether or not to jump in and break it up because I felt bad for the old guy but there were a couple things stopping me. 1. I'm not much of a break it up kind of guy. I'm more of an egg-on and watch guy. 2. Neither of these guys were actually my customer so I didn't really have a dog in the fight. The one guy didn't really order and the other guys order was fake so in my pizza delivery mind I was thinking \"fuck em both\" 3. I didn't want to risk my job or criminal charges if I got involved and ended up hurting someone by accident or not. 4. At this point I had backed up pretty far and it was really slippery so I was not about to run back over there. \n\nLuckily for my conscience, the kids dad had heard the commotion and came out to break it up. The dad was clearly a pussy who let his son get away with murder because after it was over, instead of apologizing to his neighbor for the crazy behavior of his son, he was like, \"you better get out of here before it gets worse.\" And the son was like \"yea I fucked you up you fucking pussy.\" To an old man. Fucking loser kid stealing from his neighbors and acting like a badass all while still living at home. Fuck this guy. I felt bad for the old man but he probably shouldn't have started shit with a way younger kid like that. \n\nI got in my car and went back to the store with a great story to tell. The old man ended up calling the store later and asking me if I would back him up that the kid threw the first punch. I wasn't going to lie to the cops if I was questioned but I told him I would back him up because I felt bad for him. Luckily nothing ever came of it. \n\nIf I can remember any other stories, I'll post more!",

        "text": "So PJ's finally spent millions to purchase their new state of the art \"Drivosity\" gps topper system.\n\nIt is the biggest mistake I think this company has ever made. I never minded them using gps to make sure our drivers aren't stopping to do sketchy things, however these toppers do MUCH more than just track your gps location.\n\nEach morning we start off with a 100 score. Each delivery also has a 100 score and deducts points during your run for pretty much anything you can imagine!\n\nSpeeding is classified as going a whopping 3 miles an hour over the speed limit...no I'm not making this up. You lose points for going 3 miles an hour over the speed limit. 10 miles an hour over is grounds for termination! \n\nYou also lose points for hard breaking...so if a deer runs out in front of you, you will be penaltized for not destroying your car and stopping too fast. Same issue goes for yellow lights...you either run the red or get points deducted for stopping too quickly. Now would be a good time to mention that the system doesn't have any way of detecting stop signs or stop lights...so it doesn't penaltize you for running those.\n\nThen we have \"hard cornering\". Not quite sure how the algorithm flags this...since I've gotten flagged for it even when I practically stop traffic flow so that everyone can wait 5 minutes for me to turn. If you turn too sharply or too fast, you get points deducted.\n\nNot only is speeding an issue...but even accelerating too quickly gets your score flagged. Had this happen when purposely trying to accelerate slowly...so unless you literally have a feather for a foot, you will get flagged for this.\n\nOverall, my first day with the new toppers in place went fine after I learned how to cheat the system. It's really pretty easy...the system rewards you for driving slowly. No really, if you drive 5 mph under the speed limit the system is rumored to add points back on to your score. This seems to be true, since my last few attempts resulted in a 100 score on my run. \n\nMy worst score was a 75/100. I scored this low because I drove the way I would have without following EVERY speed limit perfectly on EVERY road in town. \n\nOverall my score for the night was a 91. I would be worried about my job if I hadn't literally drove at a snails pace all night. When I say snails pace, I mean so slow that it is unsafe to drive at those speeds. \n\nSo basically, the only way to get around the \"motion tracking technology\" is to purposely drive 5 mph under the speed limit the entire run. Say goodbye to customers, say goodbye to good tips, tell time to screw off...because our drivers are now rewarded for being slow.\n\nWho would've thought a major delivery chain actually put a system in place to forcibly make drivers take longer on their runs...overall lowering customer satisfaction?! I'll give it a few months before the dipwad who sold PJ's these Road Nanny devices gets sued for his \"virtual dmv\" causing accidents or worse. \n\nIn fact...i'd love to see an actual driving instructor try to throw one of these toppers on and see how he scores...I guarantee at that point it would go viral...",

I ask him why he stopped me and he tells me that if I hadn't gotten there before him he would have written me a ticket and called the cops on me for terrorist activities.

Do ya got any sandwiches?\n\nCW: We actually stop serving them after 3 pm. \n\nWL: *buzzes once again* STRIKE TWO!!! Do ya got any specials tonight?\n\nCW: since it's a Saturday, we actually don't.\n\nWL: *buzzes AGAIN* THATS STRIKE THREE AND YOURE OUT! \n\nThen she hangs up. It was a bit odd but we all had a pretty good laugh about it afterward. ",

Sometimes, the people will tip me cash, and write nothing on the receipt or vise versa. Now to the main story. I took a delivery to this woman who's total was like $18 or something. So I give her the receipt to sign, and she gives it back (I didn't look at how much she tipped me.) and then she hands me a dollar. A single fucking dollar, when I usually get $3-$5 tips. So I head back to my car, and noticed she also wrote a dollar tip on the receipt. I didn't go back and say anything to her, and don't know if it was a mistake, or on purpose. I think that because she originally only gave me a dollar, I'm just going to let it slide. Is this wrong? \nP.S. Don't get me wrong though, a $1 tip is better than nothing, so I am appreciative for that. I just feel a $2 or $3 tip would have been more appropriate. \n\nTL;DR A woman tipped me in cash, and wrote the tip on the credit card receipt. I didn't say anything to her because it was a $1 tip for both and I'm a greedy bastard. Am I wrong?  ",

But with this guy whenever I saw the address I got upset, not because he tipped like garbage, he wasn't rude, actually a really nice guy.  But whenever I delivered to him, all he had on were boxers.  And this man was probably 6' tall, 400 pounds.  Just a massive wall of a man, just hanging out with his underwear.  Like I understand that it's your house, and you can literally do whatever you want when you want, but c'mon man, just put clothes on for the 30 seconds that I'm at the door.\n\nBasically just added him to the list of customers we would talk about at the store.  He was still a nice guy.  My manager would joke about how he was waiting for a female driver to show up and it would turn into a porno. \n\ntl;dr: I delivered to this guy plenty of times.  He was in the big and tall section.  He answered the door with just his underwear on.",

        "text": "I used to order from this one place in a town where the people that delivered were always a bunch of pretty decent guys.  My gf and I would always tip even if the pizza was a little late and we honestly didn't mind because everything was always hot and well prepared.\n\nNow, I am not sure how common this still is as this was a few years ago, but this particular pizza place had the typical \"40 mins or it's free!\" type of deal.  We never adhered to this clause, as again.. everything always showed up in fine condition and we knew the delivery guys were always at the mercy of so many other variables on the way to getting us our cheesy goodness.\n\n-The Lesson-\n\nI had a buddy from out of town over for a night of beer infused gaming and we all know that a couple of hours gaming and only chugging beer results in some pretty serious desires for \"The Good Stuff\", so we decided to go for it and order Pizza and Wings.\n\nHalf an hour later...\n\nMy friend and I are just chilling out in our respective recliners and watching some boobtube.  The pizza and stuff is due in the next 5 or so minutes and we are awaiting the inevitable knock on the door, that's when I felt a rumbly in my tummy signaling I had to run to the can.  Before heading up to the resident lavatory I hand my buddy the cash and tell him to give the guy the tip and to get whatever change back and I will of course.. be down in a couple.\n \nSo I'm just sitting there in the bathroom, daydreaming about my future goodies and how tasty they will be when I hear the glorious sound of what can only be the doorbell.  A few moments later I hear some talking, the door close.. then the unmistakable sound of a car peeling the f*** off and laying a serious patch on the street in front of my house.  \"wtf?!\"\n\nI finish up in the washroom, head back downstairs and I am all like, \"What the hell was that man?\"\n\nMy buddy proceeds to say, \"They were 3 minutes late so I didn't pay and we got everything for free!\", with a big sh*t eating grin on his face. \n\nI honestly couldn't believe it, and the moment my girlfriend upstairs heard what had happened we both collectively yelped, \"OH MY GOD DUDE!\" and were cringing so hard.  The worst thing is that the delivery driver wasn't one of the regular guys and was a newbie, so the burn from my buddy was extra real.\n\nWe were honestly so stunned by the whole thing that we didn't order from that pizza place again until we moved to our new place a few months later.  Thankfully the newbie showed up one of the first times we ordered and we were able to show her how we roll.\n\nEither way, be wary of letting your dumbass friends answer the door without educating them on your household pizza delivery/receiving etiquette! 😬",

She called me at the store, I tried calling the customer, and got a voicemail with a full mailbox (aren't they always?) Her shift was almost up, so I told her bring it back and we would wait for the customer to contact us since we didn't have a working number.\n\nAbout 10:00, the customer calls us from a different number asking about the order.  We let them know what happened and that they didn't put the correct phone number on the order.  We got a new number from them, and told them we would send it out.  Order was an hour old but I wasn't going to remake it because this wasn't our fault.\n\nThen we got a short rush, as is common late at night, and because the order had already been clocked out, it wasn't on the driver screen and no one took it. I was busy with other things so I forgot about it myself.  \n\nCustomer calls back about 10:30 asking for the order.  At this point I have two drivers left, two or three orders going one way that are still being made and this previously delivered order going the complete opposite way.  I had no real choice so I sent a driver to drop off the order real quick so we could get the other deliveries out.\n\nThen while this is going on, we had a customer place an order online with one phone number on it, then a few minutes later placed another order over the phone, identical except for an extra garlic sauce.  \n\nWe didn't notice until one of the drivers was out at the house trying to get in touch with the customer, and once again this person also put a bad number on the order online. This number was someone who said they didn't place an order. The driver is calling me when we noticed the second order with a different number but same address.  Called that number from the store, no luck. \n\nAs this is happening, the driver finally gets in touch with the lady, who just ordered the same order twice because the first time she forgot extra garlic, but didn't bother to tell us when she placed an order on the phone, so we have a fully wasted order.\n\nThis is when the first driver gets back from the old order, returning with the pizzas because he got out there and they decided it had been too long and they didn't want it anymore. \n\nMeanwhile, orders were backing up because my driver was on a wild goose chase for a customer who put the wrong phone number on the order to begin with and ended up just wasting our time, a couple of pizzas, and backing things up for the other orders we had to go out.\n\nI don't understand what is so hard about ordering a fucking pizza online.",

I worked there for about half a year and had no real incidents happen until I take this horrible delivery on a slow as hell day. \nSo, I'm driving to this house that's in a pretty nice suburb. Nice cars and big houses. I go up to the door and give it a solid knock (people have issues hearing in their huge houses). Next thing I know this huge boxer runs up and hits the door and scares the he'll out of me. I laugh it off and just wait for the owner while this dog barks his head off at me (pretty common for a dog to lose it when a stranger knocks on a door so w.e.). The customer opens the door and i had him the receipt. As soon as he hands it back to me signed the dog slowly circled behind him and lunges at my arm! I just try to protect the pizza and keep this dog from biting my crotch. The guy then pushes the dog out into the yard. I stand there dumbfounded when he tells the dog to go inside while I'm still standing my the door and guess what? IT ATTACKS ME AGAIN! He then pushes the dog inside. Here's our talk after (M = me, Dc = dumb customer)\n\nDc - \"I'm sorry he's never done that before\"\nM - \"Yeah that was a little crazy huh. Well here's your pizza. I hope it's okay.\"\nDc - \"here let me get you something \"( he leaves and comes back with a $5 Bill, smiles and apologizes again. \nM - \"thank you have a good night\" \n\nI get back to my car and see that he only gave me a total of $10 tip on a $40 order after his dog ripped into my arm. I head back to store and explain to my manager who is just shocked as all hell about what happened. I ended up going to the doctors to get the bite looked and a tetanus shot for good measure (hell yeah workers comp).\n\nTLDR - got bit by a dog and only got $10 for not making a big deal about it.\n\nMonths later I went back to the guy who thankfully locked his dog up this time and only got a $3 tip on a $40 order so screw him.",

        "text": "Little background: I was 20 years old at the time, engaged and this the first job I had ever gotten in my life. This incident happened nearly 2 months after working at the store. This happened a little over a year ago. (Just finding this sub)\n\nIt's 10:30 at night and I was on my last delivery run, which happened to be a double delivery. I take my first delivery with no problems at all, if we are gonna overlook the fact that it was literally a weed hotbox (but I'm delivering pizza, what did I expect?). So once I get done there I realize that the next delivery is an apartment complex in a rather wealthy part of town and I was just glad my last delivery was going to hopefully be good with the tips.\n\nSo I get there and since they are enclosed apartment buildings (meaning you have to go inside to find the apartment), I had to call the woman to come get her food due to our store policy. So I call and it goes to voice-mail which isn't a surprise given the fact I have an out-of-area area code. So I call again and the woman answers and I can instantly tell she had been crying. I ask her to come outside and she comes out to sign the receipt. She has eye-liner and other assortment of make-up crap streaking down her face from all her tears and it's obvious something was REALLY bothering and had been for awhile. With-out all this going on, she was a solid 8/10.\n\nI freeze because I instantly knew that something seriously wrong was going on. So being the caring person I am, I say, \"Hey. I know it may not be my place, but is everything alright? It's OK if you don't want to tell me, but I'm just concerned.\" She looks at me with a thousand yard stare, breaks down a little more and says, \"About 30 minutes ago I found out my husband is cheating on me with some 18 year old bitch and I am a little distraught right now.\"\n\nI DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO! So I told her the usual, \"It'll be alright. He seems like an asshole and he doesn't deserve you anyways...\" and other things to kind of make her feel better. She asks for a hug and it was one of the best hugs I ever had and it carried on for awhile considering she was glad to have someone there for her. When we got done she thanked me very much and ended up giving me a $7 tip. I wasn't too mad considering I'm lucky if I get $2 tips. Here's where things get weird, I turn around and start walking towards my car and I hear her ask \"Do you want to have sex with me?\"\n\nInstantly a lot of of thoughts go through my head. 1) You're engaged, 2) Nobody would ever know about it, 3) This is literally the epitome of most online porn openings, and many other \"20 year old sex-driven\" thoughts. Considering she was one of the hottest girls to have ever offer sex to me before, it took all I had to turn around and say as sincerely as possible, \"Look, given any other circumstance I would say yes in a heartbeat. But as of right now, you are not in the right state of mind and I would rather you not make any decisions you would regret later after you calm down. Plus, I am engaged right now and the last thing I would want to do is put my girl in the same situation. So I am going to have to say no and I hope you respect my decision.\"\n\nShe looked at me and motioned me to come over and to hand her the receipt back. I handed it to her and she said, \"There aren't too many more guys out there like you anymore and I really do appreciate it. I admire you for saying no even though I'm not going to get laid tonight. So here you go.\" That $7 tip ended up turning into $30 and I tried to convince her to bring it down but she refused and walked right back into her building. I was befuddled the entire drive back and had both the angel and devil shoulders arguing back and forth but I was proud out what I did.\n\n **tl:dr**: Ended up turning down sex for a distraught customer after she found out her husband cheated on her and got a much bigger tip than I could ever imagine.",

That way they don't have to look you in the face while they stiff you.\n\nAnd the kid is just so happy because they're acting like a grown up and a pizza delivery is still the highlight of their week. So you gotta smile back at them while you take your eleven cent tip. \n\n---\n\nOnly thing worse is when a parent clearly left cash for their older (teenage) kids to pay for the order, it's in a neat little pile on a table by the door. You tell the kid how much it is and they count out the money, hand you exact change and then pocket the leftover money that was obviously meant to be the tip. ",

        "text": "So at our store, we \"had\" a policy that we don't deliver to a certain area after dark. It is a high crime area, and a few years back one of our drivers got carjacked in the area. The problem is, management were always pushovers about the policy...and the online system never updated this sector info...so online orders still came through in areas we are not supposed to deliver to. If the order was made...managers would make you take it anyways.\n\nNone of our drivers ever liked delivering to the area and some even refused entirely...as it is a waste of gas...and literally no one out in the area ever tips.\n\nA few days ago, a complaint was sent to our GM and DM. The lady in question complained that because she was African American we did not deliver to her area...and she even went as far as saying that we should hire an African American driver for the purpose of delivering to her area. Keep in mind, we used to have one driver who was black...and just like all our drivers, he hated taking deliveries out to her area because it was dangerous and not worth wasted gas and no tips.\n\nSo basically in response, our DM immediately bends over backwards for the lady...who IMO seems more racist about the fact that none of our drivers are black than the fact that we don't deliver to the high crime area that she lives in. He immediately tells us that we must deliver to this sector at all times. Our policy was reversed and now we get deliveries to murder central all times of night...ESPECIALLY in the last few minutes before close. \n\nLast night was one of the scariest deliveries i've ever taken. Wrong address. So I pull up to an address with a bunch of guys selling drugs on a street corner and walking up to car windows to sell their supply and get money. After walking up and down the street praying none of them are short on cash...I finally call the customer and find their address. Pretty sure one of our drivers is gonna end up robbed here soon...hope it's not me.\n\nMoral of the story...if a pizza place ever won't deliver to you...just call them racist and you immediately get whatever you please.",

Me and the other two drivers are finishing up our dishes, floors, putting stuff up. Guy calls around 12:45AM to order. Naturally I answer the phone as I am the next driver up on the screen and I don't mind taking and order on my way home. A dollar is a dollar.\n\nCustomer requests a large sausage pizza for delivery to his home address. Proceeds to wish to pay by card, and his card is declined and the following conversation pursues.\n\nI ask the fellow \"Do you have so and so bank?\"\nCustomer: \"Why yes I do, how did you know?\"\nMe: \"Well so and so bank has been declining any transactions related to pizza delivery here for some god forsaken reason. Do you have another card or cash?\"\nCustomer: \"Well I have a 50$ bill will that work?\"\nMe: \"Yes, that is fine the order total is 17.40$ I will likely be the one delivering your order. Being as we are shutting down it may be a little longer than normal approx 30-45 minutes.\"\nCustomer: \"Okay! Just have them bring me 30$, the rest will be for their tip\"\n[Behind me his pizza is already being put in the oven, we finish up the conversation and I finish up all my chores and head out on my way home with a coworker in the car with me as I was to take him home also.]\n\n\nGet to the guys house at around 1:20AM, dark, no lights on. Cute little heel biters yapping at me as I approach with my handy dandy flashlight. I go and knock on the door a few times pretty damn hard. No response. Dogs still barking, go back to car, try calling him once, twice, starts hanging up on me immediately. Hmm... maybe it's cause I don't have a car topper on?\nCall store, have them try calling him, nothing. So I decided to be a twat and honk my horn for a solid 10 seconds. No response. Yet the TV is on... I would say he likely fell asleep but the fact my calls started declining rapidly to him with no option for voicemail I'd say he blocked my number.\n\nDecided to nope the fuck out of there. Try calling store again and start heading back to it, and in that short 10 minute period everyone left so I was out 17.40$ for the night.

I understand that things can be confusing, especially if you're not used to apartment complexes and such, but sometimes it even happens when he's going to houses. But that would be okay if it was just that, because I know that people take time to learn these sorts of things, especially on their first few weeks.\n\nBut that's not just it.\n\nThe second major issue is that he literally doesn't fucking do anything. I don't mean like, he dicks around on his phone and is lazy or anything.\n\nI mean, he literally will just sort of stand there.\n\nRight by the computer screen.\n\nNo matter how busy it is, no matter how much shit there is to do.\n\nAnd you think I might be exaggerating, but let me tell you the kind of shit that happened.\n\nSo it's closing time, and it's me, new guy, the closing cook, and the closing manager. Closing manager is taking a smoke because idk everyone fucking smokes nowadays i guess, closing cook is in the bathroom, so it's just me and driver man.\n\nI'm mopping, and he's just sort of standing there.\n\nI hear the phone ring, and take the order. It's some fucking shitty ass little kids that like want some weird shit on their pizza (Like, half of it no cheese, every half with different toppings, took like 5 minutes for them to figure out everything), so I'm not really excited about this delivery. However, it's his, not mine. \n\nThe cook comes back, and makes the pizzas, but then gets busy with cleaning and such. I'm still working on my mopping, and new guy is standing like the best god damn tree around.\n\nThe pizzas soon come out, and sit at the end of the oven.\n\nAnd I stare at the pizza\n\nand the cook stares at his work that he's finishing up because he has to get all of the toppings put away properly\n\nand the manager is smoking\n\nAnd new guy is just stares at those pizzas.\n\nAnd then the thoughts of these dank ass little kids go through my head. So I decide that I'm not going to give a shit, and do a little experiment.\n\nI will see what can take down the immovable wall.\n\nSo I keep mopping. I'm a fucking god at mopping, these floors are so god damn clean, the floors are shining like a vietnamese brothel.\n\nThis goes on for like... probably about 5-10 minutes, and this man doesn't move at all. I see him look at the make table, but he makes no sort of attempt to do anything, even though he knows that that's his delivery. He actually does end up walking towards the dishes and puts away some stuff, but still.\n\nAs I see my order coming out, I decide it's time to end this battle.\n\n\"Hey man, is your order up yet?\"\n\"oh yeah i think it's sitting right there\"\n\"oh.... uh... well.... im mopping right now, do you wanna go ahead and make that?\"\n\"might as well\"\n\n\"might as well\" boy this is your delivery and money lmao come on stop this.\n\nSo he goes to make table. I assume that he's trained on make table enough, because he hasn't said anything on the contrary, plus he's been here for a few days so I'd assume that was part of his training.\n\nHe starts off by retrieving the pan from the oven. However, someone threw the tongs (or whatever the name of the grabber thing is?) in the dishwasher. At this point, someone would ask \"where are the tongs.\" Additionally, seeing that he put away some of the dishes, I could assume that he placed the tongs somewhere that wasn't the make table.\n\nSo he's balancing this pan on his spatula. Somehow he makes it onto the make table, and then takes the pizza out of the pan in the correct way. Afterwards, he then proceeds to cut the pizza.\n\nBut the pizza doesn't really get cut. The pizza is still a solid circle. I actually thought he didn't cut it until I looked in the box and saw the indents of cuts. This composition of pizza is crucial.\n\nAfter doing this, he lifts the pizza up with the spatula, and tries to put it in the box. The spatula that is like, no more than a few inches wide, trying to put the entire pizza inside of the box.\n\nHe repeats this process again, except the second one went even worse, because either he cut it deeper or something, so the thing refused to move as a single unit.\n\nBut he somehow got it in.\n\nAll I could do was just look and just die in my mind. I could tell that he was at least TRAINED because he knew the entire process, knew how many slices went in the pizza, and knew the tools that he might have needed. It was like on the cusp of \"i have been trained but oh my god i have forgotten crucial steps\"\n\nOf course he didn't ask for help, so this entire order is just a mess, and probably got to the people's house super late.\n\nThe real kicker is at the end of this, he takes like 2 minutes before actually putting the pizzas in bag and leaving. I'm on make table now making my delivery, and I see two large boxes sitting on make table. These can't possibly be his order, can they? Because his order was two medium pizzas!\n\nIt was a tiny ass medium pizza in a large box.\n\nHe did this twice.\n\nHe is a delivery driver\n\nHe knows how big pizzas should be and what boxes they go in.\n\nOn top of all of this, he messes up orders all of the time. I'm not entirely sure if he forgets sides and whatnot (generally our manager will put all sides in the bags, including sodas and cheese/peppers), but I've had about 5 deliveries that he either tagged out as me, grabbed the wrong order, or just did something astronomically wrong, and other people have said they've had issues with him too. \n\nWhich is incredibly unfortunate, because it's frustrating when I have to figure out his mistakes, especially when he takes so long between him tagging out and him actually leaving. It sucks when I'm about to leave on a quad but then I see \"oh he took one of my fucking orders that's the complete opposite direction of his delivery.\"\n\nOn top of all of this, he complains that he doesn't get that good of tips. I didn't hear him complain about this, but I overheard a different driver and the manager talking. His numbers did sound horrible, but I kind of want to grab him and tell him \"if you take forever to do deliveries and forget shit and have a lot of issues, your tips are going to suck\", because it's definitely NOT the delivery area, considering I average between about $90-$120 a night in the exact same area.\n\nPlus this dude showed up to work in sweatpants lmaoooo.\n\nHas anybody else had experiences with like, insanely bad new people?",

        "text": "Growing up, I was a picky eater, as many kids tend to be. When it came to pizza, not only did I demand plain cheese, I also did not prefer sauce, opting instead for white pizza. As I aged, I eventually grew to enjoy other toppings (and yes, tomato sauce), but pretty much only stuck to the common ones like pepperoni and sausage. Eventually I'd branch out a bit more to include others, such as onions, bell peppers, diced tomatoes, but still disliked many others, such as olives and mushrooms.\n\nPineapple, though? I never even considered it. Who the hell puts fruit on a pizza?\n\nFast forward to my undergraduate days at university. I started delivering for Domino's to make some money. It really was quite a good job to have as a college student. Better than minimum wage, lots of easy deliveries to campus, and free food! Yeah, the free pizza was probably the real reason I wanted that job.\n\nHere's the catch though: most of that free pizza was cancelled orders or mistakes. I didn't get to choose what was on the pizza, and I quickly learned to not care. Who was I to argue with free pizza, no matter what was on it? \n\nThe first few times I had pineapple on a pizza, I didn't think it was good, and I think most of the pineapple haters are in the same boat. They tried it once, didn't like it (and can you blame them, really? It's a lot different than any other topping), and gave up on it.\n\nFor me, though, pineapple was the one topping that really grew on me during my time delivering. I'm still not a fan of olives or mushrooms (though I will eat them), but pineapple is now something I quite enjoy. So that's it really. If I hadn't worked at Domino's, I'd probably still be in the anti-pineapple camp.\n\n**TL;DR:** Give pineapple a chance! Maybe it will grow on you, too.",

We broke all our stores records and by the time the storm got so bad people had to get off the road we were nearly out of everything. I made about 250$ in tips as we were enforcing a 5$ minimum tip for the weather and every driver was paid an extra dollar per delivery. We ran out of wings, pizza dough, brownies, many pizza boxes. We pulled in supplies from one of our other stores that closed early. It was only me and 4 other drivers crazy enough to drive in it. \n\nI knew this would happen and installed a snorkel on my car for this day. I even helped a few other drivers install snorkels as well. Only had to use it once thankfully. The only reason we closed is our power finally went out. Crazier than the superbowl and Halloween combined and my best night as a driver.\n\nBy the time I headed home I had a quarter of a tank with nowhere to fuel up and both sides my home road was on was blocked by a tree which I was able to squeeze around. Somehow the drive way wasn't covered yet. Next morning though after the storm passed 3 trees are blocking it and I'm stuck here with no power. Breaking out the chainsaw in the morning so I can get to work. \n\nI wish every night wasn't so busy and all these nice people were out like this more regularly. I'll happily deliver in a storm any time. ",

        "text": "So hear me out.\n\nFor some reason this bullshit always happens when I have a double going to the dorms. Luckily though the first one went as fine as it could. Called while entering the parking lot, they came down within like a minute, signed for the pizza, stiffed me, business as usual.\n\nThis second one, though. First off, the parking for this place is horrible. Mind you these buildings are like, 20 stories tall, so there's a LOT of people living here. However, there's like, no parking. It's a decent enough walk to go from the road to the dorm, and I don't even see a parking lot anywhere. Somehow they make it work but whatever.\n\nI actually called these people right when I finished the first delivery, so that bought me some more time. However, as always, when I get there, the people aren't there. That's fine, I don't care anymore, I've accepted that life is hell.\n\nSo after like 3 minutes these two girls walk down, and walk towards me. Nobody really says hi to me when they're in the dorms, they just kind of walk towards me and stare at me. No \"Are you here for [name]\" or \"hi this is probably for us\", just this weird sort of \"You should somehow know that it's me\"\n\nSo this is about average, I sit at the table, I pull the food out, and then I give them the total. So their total is something like $22.44.\n\nThis is when hell decides to show me its true wrath.\n\nI'll try to accurately explain this.\n\nSo the first girl hands me a wad of change. She says something to the extent of \"This is $2.44\", but I wasn't really paying attention since I usually don't count the change unless they need change back.\n\nThen there was a sort of silence. Not like, deafening, but it reminded me of a previous delivery that I've done, where I had to deliver a group of kids. They handed me a wad of change and were like \"This is all we have.\", before I just kind of stared them down and they gave me the rest of the money, saying \"oh that was a prank\"\n\nPreparing to get pranked, I simply say \"You're gonna need to give me more than that\"\n\nThe second girl enters the game. She hands me another wad of quarters, not saying anything. I'm hoping at some point that someone pulls out some bills or something, or I can just go home and take the pizza with me.\n\nAnother moment of silence. I look obviously annoyed so this one is slightly shorter.\n\nThen the first girl hands me a $10 bill.\n\nThen the second girl hands me a $20 bill.\n\nI'm befuddled. I have no clue what to do at this point, I'm handling like a fuckton of change and crumpled up bills, but I'm not really in the mood to try to piece things together.\n\n\"do you guys need any change today?\"\n\nThe classic \"what the fuck?\" look came from both of them, as if I was stupid for asking them for change, and I should just automatically give it to them.\n\nDecent enough.\n\n\"How much change do you need today?\"\n\nAnother look of confusion before they look at each other, and look back at me.\n\n\"Okay, so I need $9 and she needs $3\" one of the girls says.\n\nI look at them. Then I look at the pile of change on the table. Then I look at them again while they really emphasize their resting bitch face. \n\n\"Oh... okay... so I can probably give you back this change then...\"\n\nI attempt to hand them the change.\n\nTheir hands do not accept.\n\nI was tempted to just kind of force it into their hands on the side of their body, but I don't feel like getting screamed at.\n\nSo I pull out my bank, divvy out their change, and just kinda stand there. Looking at this fucking mess of change and bills all over this table. \n\nI've never screamed in my car but im sure the entire campus heard a relatively muffled \"WHAT THE FUCK\" as I sat in my car, trying to process this entire situation\n\nWhy do people do this lmao\n\nWhy do people stare at me like I'm retarded when I can't figure out their stupid fucking payment system.\n\nWhy can't people figure this out BEFORE I get there.\n\nI don't know if this is just a new thing. When I was in my undergrad and people wanted pizza, we usually would all sit down, go online, look at the price, group all the money together, and give it to one person and either tell them how much change we need or give a decent tip. \n\nEspecially BOTH of them had change! If they split it between them, it would be $11.22.\n\nThe girl with the $20 gives her $20 to the girl with the $10, while getting her $10, and then they both contribute a stack of quarters and the change.\n\nI hate to use cliches but honestly how do people get into college like this aaaaaa",

I make my delivery and am short 2 dollars due to being hit with a large bill right before this delivery. Of course I was not going to get a tip he wanted all his change. I explain I'm short 2 bucks and tell him business is few blocks away can come back with short change.(2 fuxking dollars) he said it's all good don't worry.. I said \"thanks for the tip\".. I go finish drop offs and return to place of business.  Upon returning this mans lady called, complained and wanted her two bucks back. So I return pull car halfway in alley and see same 3 hood rats.. \n   \n   I give the dude 2 bucks and upon returning to my car in alley/street i am punched in the right brow and cut due to wearing glasses .. I then realize other 2 have semi surrounded me and one has a knife pulled on me. (Basic assisted opening pocketknife with 4-6 inch blade) they try and run my pockets so I step back and hand them cash (less then $200) they ask for wallet which is empty besides i.d and a snowball stand punch card worth a free snowball those bastards.. I hand it over: they strut off, not even run, as I scurry to my vehicle, get in &amp; drive to my job bleeding from the punch.\nI return and tell them what happened all shooken up from anger as they call cops me and owners son drive back to the spot where it happened and find no one (big fucking sarcastic surprise) so cops come bring me back to scene of crime do their song and dance were I explain to 6 different cops what happen they shine their flashlights around make me fill out report and bring me back to restaurant.\n\n Cops are gone and it's just me and the mom, pop and older son are now being aggressive towards me.

I've taken older son to football games while on shift, tutored their younger children in reading and spelling, given them rides to the store, rides home.. Even planned to see older son play a football game and they turned on me like fucking animals.\n\n  Not sure what my options are guys I live in baltimore county if that means anything.

        "text": "Fuck dorms\n\nWhen I was delivering in California, the closest college with dorms was about 30 minutes away, so I never had to deal with this. However, I heard stories. Now that I've moved out to Texas, I live within walking distance to school, so I deliver to the dorms.\n\nI hate them so much. \n\nI'd hate to pull the \"ohohoho im a graduate studente these silly undergraduates are so silly\" but like come on.\n\nHow are you guys 18-21 and don't know how to do this shit.\n\nLet's me explain this shit point by point.\n\nSo first of all they're all annoying as fuck to get to. The ones I deliver to aren't HORRIBLE once you know which one is which, but  when I covered a store by the other local university, these dorms were all screwed up. The address means nothing. You just HAVE to know where Pepitos Hall is because the address takes you to the fucking Recreation Center and the kid on the phone is just going to be like \"uhhhhh yeah so uhh just go to Pepitos hall\" like where the fuck are you man.\n\nThen I can't just go to the dorm rooms. Because I'm a student there I think I might be able to access some since we use an ID card system here, but I haven't tried it. This kind of makes things less shitty because I don't have to learn dorm layouts like I do for apartments. Usually there's someone down there that will at least let me inside the lobby, so that's pretty nice, but there's no guarantee.\n\nBut then that creates a new problem. This problem being that IT TAKES 10 YEARS FOR PEOPLE TO COME DOWN.\n\nI try to combat this. I'll usually call them as I'm entering the parking lot, which won't have them DOWN by the time I get there, but it should have them on their way and I should only have to wait a minute.\n\n\"uhhhhhh okayyyy give me like 5 minutesss\"\n\nyou bitch\n\nI really can't expect people to understand our jobs entirely and wait 20 minutes in the lobby for us to arrive, but if I'm arriving on time +/- 10 minutes, people should at least be somewhat ready to pick things up.\n\nWhen it comes to orders, dorms literally order what I call \"meal deals from hell.\" These consist of three things\n\n1) A single pizza with very conservative toppings. Usually a medium too. Usually also with no coupons.\n2) A personal pan pizza and wings.\n3) Wings and Fries since that's a meal deal we have here and it's pretty cheap.\n\nThese are deals where I can pretty much expect to not get tipped at all. They're from people who won't tip because \"oh haha im a poor college student :-)))\" but want to have the convenience of hot food being delivered to them.\n\nThis would be enough, but in my experience, they're also probably some of the rudest people I've ever seen. College kids in apartment complexes? half and half. I've had people who act like their girlfriend broke up with them, and I've had people who are happy and understanding of the business and will tip really well and make friendly conversation. But with dorms I pretty much feel like they see me as a servant. There's a certain look that they give you, a look of \"ugh why is this guy making me walk down here, just give me my food, slave\"\n\nThere's two stories that I think demonstrate why I've developed such a hatred of these places\n\n1) So it's a relatively busy day and I get a double going to the dorms. I figure that it's gonna be annoying but at least it's quick and easy hopefully. So the first one is to the closest dorm to us. I go ahead and try to call them to let them know I'm here.\n\n\"This number is out of service\"\n\nAt this point, I should have left. Tried calling twice, no pick-up, I go back to the store and let someone else deal with it.\n\nBut I don't, because I am a terrible delivery driver. So I walk inside and make my way inside of the lobby, leaving my other order in the car.\n\nThese dorms are weird because they actually have consistent staff that sits in an office and manage shit, so I go up to them\n\n\"Hey, can you contact [name]\"\n\"no we can't contact residents\"\n\nI don't particularly have time for this shit, so I talk to them for a little and see what I can do. I sit at the desk and try calling again, and then just leave, because I literally can't do anything. I can only type in the same phone number so many times and walk around the lobby a few times before I can leave (Additionally the staff also said \"yeah I guess if she's not here you just have to leave and well tell them that the phone number didn't work and you left\")\n\nSo I drive over to the other delivery, which is just across the street. Call once.\n\n\"Hello?\"\n\"Hi, this is CDFReditum from [P I Z Z A Z O N E], I'm here with your order, can you go ahead and meet me downstairs?\"\n\"... *hang up*\"\n\nWorld is a fuck, i am trash man.\n\nI wait for a bit, thinking maybe he just was kind of a douche and him hanging up meant \"yeah im coming down\"\n\nSo it's been like 3 minutes and I decide to call again.\n\nSame conversation, except the guy actually replied. \"okay I'll be down\"\n\nTurns out he didn't answer because I have a California area code and I live in Texas. Mind you that he placed an order from that exact store and that he could have at least said SOMETHING like \"oh where are you delivering to\" or \"uh is this for [name]\"\n\nHe delivered and didn't tip, but fuck it, the food's out.\n\nSo I drive back to the store, ready to cancel that other order.\n\nSometime while I was out, the Wildlife Conservation Fund I guess brought in a Manatee to manage our store because this 400 pound woman in the dirtiest shirt I've ever seen is just yelling at me. \"HEY, THOSE PEOPLE JUST CALLED, THEY SAID YOU JUST CAME AND LEFT, AND YOU DIDN'T TRY TO DELIVER THE FOOD\"\n\n\"Their phone number didn't work and the staff couldn't contact them\"\n\n\"WELL YOU NEED TO YELL AT THE STAFF AND YOU NEED TO TELL THEM THAT AT EVERY OTHER DORM THEY'LL ALWAYS DO THAT AND ITS UNACCEPTABLE THAT YOU DO THIS AND I CAN\"T BELIEVE THAT YOU...\"\n\nAnd this kind of was just going on, but I fazed it out after a while, while one of the CSRs came up to me.\n\n\"they said they were sitting outside\"\n\nGREAT, TAG BACK IN, GRAB SOME ORDER GOING IN THE SAME DIRECTION, RUN.\n\nThe university is super close, but it doesn't make it any less annoying that I have to deal with this shit. So I come back, walk to the dorm, STILL not having a valid phone number, but at the very least they ARE sitting out front.\n\n\"Hey there! Sorry for the issue, your guys phone number didn't work! There must have been a typo or something!\"\n\nThey both look like I had taken a fat shit inside of their pizza. It's the kind of thing that I thought was reserved for angry elderly women. It's as if they believed that I personally just didn't want to deliver their pizza. \n\nI show them the receipt, and I try to explain to them the phone number, trying to figure out what was wrong, but they were just both dead silent, glaring at me.\n\nNo tip, once again. A classic case of crossing out the tip line and writing the total on the total line.\n\nAll for a 8 piece of wings and fries.\n\nI have another story but im too lazy to write it so uh get ready for it eventually\n\nfuck dorms",
