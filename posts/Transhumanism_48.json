        "text": "I've thought on the subject of transhumanism and the future of all the species of this planet extensively.\n\nAn interesting question I would like to put to you is this \"Since embracing transhumanism, do you find you have less appreciation for nature?\"  I'm finding this is so with me.  Without getting into the nitty-gritty, let's say I was a thoroughly brainwashed religious fundamentalist with a science streak until about 5 months ago, when I suddenly awoke and a repressed ultra-liberal scientific mind took precedence.  Before I thought that nature was some incredible masterpiece, a brilliantly constructed work of art from the mind of \"gawud\" himself.  Now I just see the product of millions of years of trial-and-error to find a balance.\n\nHow does this relate to transhumanism? I can't help but feel that transhumanism is concerned with elevating only the *human* species, and balls to any other form of life that is not immediately useful to us.  I'd rather we considered it our moral duty to protect all life regardless of its use or potential, but that doesn't seem to be the central creed of transhumanism.  When I go jogging, I marvel at the beauty of the grass, trees and plants. But I also think how it could all be replaced by a perfect brain simulation or intelligent self-arranging nanobots in the future, and I worry that the inherent species-selfishness will not only lead to the destruction of plenty of life on this planet, but the moving away from the beauty of nature and preferring \"synthetic\" and human made environments.\n\nSo what do you think /r/transhumanism? Has the focus on uplifting humanity dulled your appreciation of nature? If so, how do you think we can change this paradigm? And do you think that the future of our self-evolving species allows for \"deep connections\" to our environment and nature?",

        "text": "Premise - Human wants are infinite.\n\nIt will override all current wants and desires and make them redundant.\n\nIt makes individuality and libertarianism natural and default.\n\nThe project, if realized, is a sure-shot way to make Enlightenment deals a reality for everyone.  \n\nPost Scarcity/Schole Primary Conditions:\n\nIf Post-Scarcity is not realized in its totality, humanity really has no hope whatsoever.\nTill the time this becomes a reality people would be hand-to-mouth at some level or the other.\n\n1. Energy - Nuclear Fusion for endless electricity production with sea-water being the source, High capture solar power, harnessing the power of Sun in space and beaming the energy back on the planet. \n\n2. Fuel - Hydrogen, Air, Nuclear Fusion.\n\n3. Raw Materials - replacement of mining, produce raw materials like the universe literally produces them. Molecular assemblers, atom by atom assembly of elements. Nuclear Fusion and artificially reenacted celestial mechanisms of elemental production. Clever and ongoing materials research. All the products could be narrowed down to only a few raw materials (eg. Carbon Fiber) and those materials can be abundantly produced. \nEg. Replicators in Star Trek\n\n4. Food - molecular manufacturing, clever agriculture, meal replacement pills, in-vitro meat, biofermenter. \n\n5. Geoengineering - Human control over ecology and environment.\n\n6. Full understanding of Human Brain - for Transhumanism.\n\n7. Full understanding of Human Genome - for Transhumanism.\n\n8. Full Understanding of Human Sexuality - for Transhumanism\n\n9. Desalination. For clean water.\n\n10. Strong Artificial General Intelligence - for ridding ourselves of most work and aiding in research. Automate all research, organization, creativity, construction, manufacturing, and services. Then ‘download’ these capabilities into enhanced human brains. ‘Upload’ the advances from human to human-assisted brains. This Superintelligence should always be slaves to human desires, and never the other way round. \n\n11. Constant up-gradation and/or creative destruction.\n\n12. Easy population control measures. Eg. RISUG, artificial wombs. If needed, a fast and painless way to wipe out populations. Eg. Nembutal. This is probably the only area where production/consumption would have to be limited. World population should be limited to around 200 million people. \n\n13. Common lingua franca for all the people to communicate, emote and express in.\n\n14. Entertainment, Education, and Social Hub in every population cluster.\n\n15. Operations, Maintenance and Innovation - for maintaining the utopia and making it better with more tools.\n\n16. Infrastructure. Hard and Soft. Efficient design of human population centers - well connected highly urbanized big cities, cultural infrastructure to foster creativity.\n\n17. Reconstruction of the forest cover and the wildlife.\n\n\n18. Transport - extremely efficient design of vehicles, systems, and infrastructure - commute from one hub to another (anywhere in the world) should take only an hour.\nEg. ‘The Bat’ from The Dark Knight Rises, Elon Musk’s concept of Hyperloop. \n\n19. Hygiene\n\n20. Education, Research, and Creativity: Education is guarded by gate-keepers (competitive admission requirements, tuition fee, culture, lack of educational infrastructure). In a scarcity world making something 'highly selective' may increase it's value, but it's immoral and stupid. Post Scarcity would not need to keep these facades. Open Admissions, Free Education, Free Research, and Accessible Courses for Skill Transfer based on cutting-edge, sound, pedagogical principles. \nNo more budget-fights on whether Arts or Pure Sciences is worth anything, or if education is 'necessary' (off-course it is, it has an intrinsic value). Academic disciplines would not be judged with their financial futures, finance has become irrelevant. No stress on examinations, more stress on learning.\nMeritocracy is as bad as Red-tape or aristocracy.\n\n21. Hedonic-Transhumanism. For freeing people from the genetic limits and curse.\n\nEtc.\n\n\n\nHedonic-Transhumanism First Generation Goals:\n(Future - post first generation - goals might be inconceivable by non enhanced humans).\n\n1. Learning, Learning for the sake of learning, Data Acquisition, Skill Acquisition, Knowledge, Education, and Cerebral Augmentation (Download and Upload): come up with a way for humans to take in, process and interpret ALL the available data, in any form, and to give a unique perspective on it, without restricting data production. This would be a prerequisite to a transhuman life.\nInstant unconscious competence.\nThe thumb-rule of 10,000 hours to mastery becomes redundant. This is too much time invested in a thing which offers a very narrow perspective. It makes people heavily ego invested in old-established ways and gives a serious inertia to necessary creative destruction.\nThis needs to be overridden.\nEveryone can, would, and should know everything about everything with a unique perspective.\nEveryone should be able to absorb the plethora of complex data, indulge in creative and systems thinking, and make sense of it all, faster than are more able minded and able bodies slaves, The Robots. \nA natural in-born ability to comprehend and make sense of complex and abstract mathematical and philosophical problems, and espousing new answers based on that understanding. \nA heightened sensory awareness that in no way compromises the regular workings of the organism. \nEg. Martial Arts download in The Matrix, the positive effects of NZT in Limitless, heightened situational awareness and on-the-feet complex problem solving in The Bourne Trilogy. \n\n2. Sex: ridding jealousy, increasing relaxed confidence, getting the libido levels of both genders to be of the same (and high) level, no more alpha masculine - hypergamic feminine games, innate polyamory as a norm.\nThis would be true even if real biological androgyny becomes a norm.\nRewiring the attraction-arousing circuitry to make non-procreative sex egalitarian, baggage-free, jealousy-free, taboo-free, enjoyable, and environment independent. \n\n3. Age/Youth: ageing to physically stop after 25 years of age, people are free to annihilate themselves if they so please.\n\n4. Cognition, Curiosity, and Creativity: enhanced. High neural processing. First acting on individual minds through pills etc but ultimately to be encoded in the genome. Everybody is a born super genius with the above-mentioned capacity of data acquisition. Creativity will help to take this wagon forward which might be inconceivable at this juncture.\n\n5. Hedonism and Invincibility (Guaranteed, by Default): innate everlasting baseline euphoria with further gradients. Depression, sadness, envy, jealousy (NOT aggression) is biologically eliminated. Creativity, drive, sexuality, strength-of-character, and general well-being would benefit the most from it.\n* This is the most urgent point in the project; a pharmaceutical solution followed by a genetic one would be the post prudent way to achieve it. It is urgent because the aims and goals are big and will involve a lot of frustration, but a guaranteed sense of bliss and invincibility will help people to keep looking till they can achieve the goals without becoming melancholic.\n\n6. Birth Control: be judicious with popping out children. Ideally each individual to have one child only. Non hormonal, reversible, fast, easy fixes which do not interrupt with the libido and the physical manifestation of it.\n\n7. Fitness: disease free, super-strong, super-athletic, super-solider. \n\n8. Aesthetics: why not? Fit bodies, designer changeable skin etc.\n\n9. Food: food pill, In-Vitro meat, highly efficient and clever agriculture and animal husbandry, minimum reliance on ingestable  substances, so deriving copious amounts of energy from sun or artificial suns alone, in a very short  amount of time.\n\n10. Pharmacology and Genetic Medication: to fix regressive mutants.\n\n11. Mathematics: Instinctive understanding of Mathematics hardwired in the brain (cerebral cortex).\n\n12. New Frontiers: To explore new frontiers for (post)humans to capture and understand, this should keep boredom at bay while giving birth to an amazing stock of knowledge for humans and post-humans to implement.  \n\n13. Post Scarcity. For freeing people from the need to work/extort/cheat/fight/enslave.\nFor freeing people from alliances of blood, family, kinship, race, tribe, or nation.\nFor freeing people from any kind of tyranny.\nBecause if necessity is the mother of all invention, it is also the mother of all tyranny.\n\nEtc.\n\n\nThis would be a good place to start all future (post) human endeavors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBibliography: \n\n1.\tThe Best Money Can’t Buy – Jacque Fresco \n2.\tThe Hedonistic Imperative – David Pearce \n3.\tThe Zeitgeist Movement Explained \n4.\tThe Prince – Nicollo Machiavelli \n5.\tPropaganda – Edward Barneys \n6.\thttp://www.futurefood.org/consumers/index_en.php\n\n",
