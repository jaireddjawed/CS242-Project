We're journalists Amy Yurkanin and John Archibald — we co-hosted an investigative podcast for Reckon by [AL.com](https://www.al.com/) called Greek Gods - on [Stitcher](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/alcom/reckon-radio) and [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/reckon-radio/id1420215603?mt=2).\n\nThe podcast tells the story of a powerful secret society at the University of Alabama called 'The Machine,' which has controlled campus politics for more than a century and whose power extends to the State House, Washington, and beyond.\n\nThe Machine — known to members as Theta Nu Epsilon — serves as a training ground for Alabama politicians, schooling them in the political dark arts. It has spawned numerous governors, senators, and others. Even those who have opposed The Machine, including MSNBC 'Morning Joe' host Joe Scarborough and current Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill, go on to political careers.\n\nIn the podcast, we delve into the organization's methods — including threats of violence, wire-tapping, boycotts, voter coercion, and more — and speak to those who've reported on the Machine and the people whose lives were affected by it.\n\nAsk us anything!\n\n**A few useful links:**\n\nJohn's column introducing the podcast: [Climb inside The Machine](https://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2018/08/climb_inside_the_machine_at_ua.html)\n\n[The Makings of UA's Machine](https://www.al.com/opinion/index.ssf/2018/03/the_makings_of_uas_machine.html), including the organization's constitution\n\nAmy's [guide to the characters in the 'Greek Gods' podcast](https://www.al.com/expo/news/erry-2018/08/67dfbd9c981535/a-guide-to-the-characters-on-r.html)\n \n**Personal bios:**\n\n**John**\n\nI’m John Archibald, a columnist for the Alabama Media Group, which includes the Birmingham News, the Huntsville Times, the Mobile Press-Register, [AL.com](https://www.al.com/) and the social phenom [Reckon](https://www.facebook.com/ReckonAL/).\n\n[You can read my stories here.](http://connect.al.com/staff/jaarchib/posts.html)\n\n I’ve covered everything from crime and punishment to Birmingham City Hall, which is not always the same thing. I grew up in Alabama, went to the University of Alabama and found my life and my wife at the student newspaper there. I have three grown children who left me with their three dogs.\n\n**Amy:**\n\nI’m Amy Yurkanin, co-host and producer of Greek Gods. I live in Birmingham, Ala. with my husband, two kids, cat and lizard. We moved to Alabama from Las Vegas, where I wrote for an alt-weekly and also produced a talk show for the local NPR affiliate.\n\n[You can find my stories here](http://connect.al.com/user/AmyYurk/posts.html).\n\nAfter I recovered from the culture shock of moving from Sin City to the Bible Belt, I began to become interested in the Machine – the secret society that shaped the careers of my colleagues, John Archibald and John Hammontree. Greek Gods was my first foray into podcasting, but hopefully not my last.\n\n**PROOF:**\n[From AL.com's verified Twitter account](http://www.twitter.com/aldotcom/status/1042443722804350976)\n[From John's verified Twitter account](https://twitter.com/JohnArchibald/status/1042433513713283073)\n[From Amy's verified Twitter account](https://twitter.com/AmyKingsley4/status/1042444347998957574) ",

My team and I recently [published research](https://elifesciences.org/articles/37001?utm_source=Reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=AMASept2018) showing how the processes involved in hair and feather development are similar to the way scales develop on fish, suggesting they may all have the same ancient origin. Ask me anything!\n\nMy proof: r/[https://twitter.com/eLife/status/1040242507974680576](https://twitter.com/eLife/status/1040242507974680576)\n\nI am interested in understanding why animals look the way they do. We know that the shapes of animals and their organs are genetically encoded; after all, animals tend to resemble their parents. We also know from the fossil record that the shapes of animals and their organs evolve and change radically over long timescales. So, if we can understand how genetic instructions are decoded during development to shape adult animals, we can test hypotheses regarding the evolution of form. To this end, we study the zebrafish, a small minnow that is easy to keep and easy to breed.\n\nI’ll be here to answer questions about a [recent paper](https://elifesciences.org/articles/37001?utm_source=Reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=AMASept2018) we published in the journal eLife, where we found that fish scales and mammal hair rely on similar genetic mechanisms, suggesting a single origin of skin appendages in ancient fishes. It also puts forward the zebrafish and its scales as a good model for scientists to study, so they can understand better how certain hair and teeth disorders arise in humans. I’m happy to discuss these findings and our research more broadly. AMA!",

I started what would be a terrible business but a great social project to give kids in Detroit free scooters.\n\nI recently signed up as a charger for Bird scooters. You might know that when a scooter is super lost they increase the bounty paid out to charge that scooter up to $20. I went into the neighborhoods in Detroit to try and find some of these \"high bounty\" scooters and what I found kinda blew my mind.\n\nI came into a big housing complex and found about 10 kids pushing around 4 dead Lime and Bird scooters. I got to talking to the kids and they were super friendly but didn't have much of an idea why someone dropped off these scooters in their neighborhood. Scooters that light up totally look like a toy, and so what is an eight year old to do?\n\nThe trouble is that kids and lots of adults in Detroit don't have the required drivers licenses, bank accounts or money on hand to take part in this \"big cool future.\" It must really suck to be a Detroit kid in the summertime and see these cool looking scooters with the lights sitting out on the street corner but you're technically not allowed to touch them unless you have the means.\n\nSo I started Play Free Bird [www.playfreebird.com](http://www.playfreebird.com) where people can send us electric and manual scooters from Amazon and we'll assemble, charge and distribute them to Detroit kids who need them. It's a small project designed to make things better. If anyone is going to drop off scooters in an urban environment like Detroit they should be accessible to everyone.\n\nI'm open to your feedback if you have any on our project - and we'd love the support if you have the time.\n\nPS: We got a front page story in The Detroit Free Press about our project. You can read that here: [https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2018/09/18/bird-scooters-take-off-detroit-one-guy-wants-make-them-free/1333342002/?utm\\_medium=twitter&amp;utm\\_source=dlvr.it](https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2018/09/18/bird-scooters-take-off-detroit-one-guy-wants-make-them-free/1333342002/?utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=dlvr.it)\n\nProof of identity here: [https://imgur.com/a/SafN0Ps](https://imgur.com/a/SafN0Ps) (Compare to picture in the Free Press)\n\nThanks!!",
