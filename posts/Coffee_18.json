The last ten years, I used an old, shitty drip machine that was handed down to me from my family and made my coffee with the cheapest filters and cheapest preground coffee I could get at the grocery store. \n\nYesterday, my Moccamaster KGBT arrived and I did the two rounds of \"just water\" as instructed in the manual. This morning, I tried my \"old\" way of making coffee with the new machine and the Moccamaster filters. I also weighed my coffee for the first time, and I have apparently been using about 30g for about 750ml of water all the time. \n\nI poured myself a large mug and noticed two things while drinking:\n1. Wow, my homemade coffee can actually taste like something!\n2. Man, the coffee I've been drinking for years is *awful*.\n\nThe only taste my coffee had was very, very acidic and not much else. It was to be expected, but I did not expect that the new machine would end up making my stomach a bit upset.\n\nHas anyone had similar experiences? I've been drinking the same coffee on an empty stomach for years, so it can't really be a health thing in at of itself. \n\nCan the improved extraction really bring out the worst of cheap coffee? A hand grinder and decent whole beans are already on their way, will they make a difference?",

I’d like to keep the cost down as much as possible and ease of use for my partner as she’s very busy, so I think those kind of rule out bean to cup. \n\nI’ve been looking at pod machines. I like the variety you get with the pod flavours and strengths, I also enjoy an americano before training so this would be a nice feature but I can easily stick with the French press for that as I have been doing. \n\nThe nespresso vertuo looks great but is limited to only their pods which also seem on the more expensive side?\n\nLavazza have a good deal where you get a machine and frother for £1 when you subscribe to their pods but I’ve no idea on the quality of machine or pod? \n\nL’Or Barrista also looks good and you can then use any pods including their own and the old nespresso style but seems limited in that you don’t get the larger cup sizes for Americano or flat whites? \n\nI’m a bit lost in it all and hoping for some insight or what would be best trying to keep the initial cost around the £100 mark and monthly cost as low as possible. \n\nThanks!",

We have connections to soccer and baseball tournaments occurring all summer long and could also stake out at a moderately busy park on non event days. \n\nWe are making a business plan and scoping out what this might look like with a startup cost maxing at $4000.\n\nThe plan would be to have a tent and generator and sell both hot and iced coffee, lemonade, and basic iced teas. \n\nThe financially wise choice for coffee would probably be cold brew, iced coffee, pour overs and drip. But would it make sense (or how horrible of an idea) would it be to get a used commercial espresso machine or a prosumer machine from a very reputable company. Also if it’s just a summer project what equipment would be satisfactory. Although I’m a fan of shitty coffee nothing is better than a nice espresso, we are running the economics and it doesn’t really make sense but I would love to hear general opinions of mass producing cold brew, prepping for moderately busy crowds and general advice. FYI we do have food service/minor barista experience. \n\nAny thoughts are appreciated, who knows if we will do it but we got a little money and an entire summer to do something rewarding.

        "text": "My Baratza Encore died a few weeks ago, so I saw it as a great opportunity to upgrade to the Fellow Ode gen 2. So far though I feel that even the coarsest settings are too fine? My main brew method is single cup V60 for which I aim for a 2:30ish brew time. That usually seems to give me the best taste. Currently I only drink decaf, which I've noticed you have to grind coarser than regular pourover beans. At setting 11, I get a 4:10 brew time. The coffee doesn't taste awful, but there's room for improvement. [Here's a photo](https://i.imgur.com/9cUW327.jpeg) of the grounds at setting 11.\n\nEven when using regular beans for my girlfriend at setting 9, it seems too long of a brew time, although I don't have exact numbers.\n\nI have already redone the burr calibration according to Fellow's video instructions, but that doesn't seem to have improved things. So I was wondering: if I feel it's too fine overall, should I just calibrate the entire range a little bit coarser? Or is that not recommended?",

In this weekly thread, industry folk can post upcoming deals or other promotions their companies are holding, or promote new products to /r/Coffee subscribers! Regular users can also post deals they come across. Come check out some of the roasters and other coffee-related businesses that Redditors work for!\n\nNote that this thread will be weekly at least for the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak, since many roasters are running more specials than usual to drum up business.\n\nWe encourage everyone to post deals here especially since many roasters are holding specials to drive business affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. However, note that there will be zero tolerance for shady behavior. If you're found to be acting dishonestly here, your posting will be removed and we will consider banning you on the spot. If you yourself are affiliated with a business, please be transparent about it.\n\nThere are a few rules for businesses posting promotional material:\n\n- You need to be active in /r/Coffee in a non-self-promotional context to participate in this thread. If it seems you are only here to promote your business in this thread, your submissions will be removed. Build up some /r/Coffee karma first. The Official Noob-Tastic Question Fest weekly thread, posted every Friday, would be a good place to start, and check out what is on the Front Page and jump in on some discussions. Please maintain a high ratio of general /r/Coffee participation to posts in this thread.\n\n- If you are posting in this thread representing a business, please make sure to request your industry flair from the mods before posting.\n\n- Don't just drop a link, say something worthwhile! Start a discussion! Say something about your roasting process or the exciting new batch of beans you linked to!\n\n- Promotions in this thread must be actual deals/specials or new products. Please don't promote the same online store with the same products week after week; there should be something interesting going on. Having generally “good prices” does not constitute a deal.\n\n- No crowdfunding campaigns (Kickstarter, Indiegogo, etc). Do not promote a business or product that does not exist yet. Do not bait people to ask about your campaign. Do not use this thread to survey /r/Coffee members or gauge interest in a business idea you have.\n\n- Please do not promote affiliate/referral programs here, and do not post referral links in this thread.\n\n- This thread is not a place for private parties to sell gear. /r/coffeeswap is the place for private party gear transactions.\n\n- Top-level comments in this thread must be listings of deals. Please do not comment asking for deals in your area or the like.\n\n- More rules may be added as needed. If you're not sure whether or not whatever you're posting is acceptable, message the mods and ask! And please, ask for permission first rather than forgiveness later.",

I’m in NYC so there are good options available.  \n\nHowever, I still use a Keurig-style (Ezbasics) single serve machine with my own ground coffee. The machine does its job and it’s well rated on Amazon, but I notice that the coffee is just too weak and thin, and when I remove the filter I can see a well defined hole in the middle of the coffee bed.\nDoes that mean I’m not getting enough extraction? The K-Cups can only fit 2 tablespoons of coffee, so I wonder if there’s any solution to that at all.\nDo you recommend moving to an Aeropress or something like it? Ease of use and speed are a priority but I’m thankfully becoming more demanding with the coffee I drink.\n\nThank you very much!",

Above the caffeine meter, it recommends as a default to use 4 fl. oz. concentrate and 4 fl. oz. of something else (e.g., water, milk). Is this then a \"serving,\" which would make 4 fl. oz. of concentrate, not 8 fl. oz., have 230 mg, yielding 58 mg per fl. oz.? Then, on the nutrition label, it says that a serving size is 6 fl. oz.  Yet. above the label it says that it makes 8 servings when prepared as directed, with an asterisk that appears nowhere else; if the box makes 8 servings (instead of the 5 stated on the nutrition label) and the box has 32 fl. oz., this part reinforces the idea that the 8 oz. serving of the caffeine meter is meant to be 4 fl. oz. of concentrate, not 8.",

        "text": "I recently made a calculator to help with figuring out coffee to water ratios. I created this tool because I found it a pain to convert back and forth between the different units of measurement used in coffee brewing, such as grams per liter and coffee to water ratios. Some recipes call for one, and some for the other, and I wanted a tool that could easily handle both. I am new to making coffee and pour overs so the added headache of math in the morning was not welcome.\n\nThe calculator takes two inputs: the desired strength of the coffee in either grams per liter or a coffee to water ratio, and the desired amount of water for the brew. The calculator then outputs the corresponding amount of coffee in grams required for the desired strength.\n\nAdditionally, the calculator provides a table of common strength percentages to assist with following recipes. \n\nYou can access the calculator by visiting [https://brewmath.com](https://brewmath.com/) and you can find the source code on GitHub at [https://github.com/cgbur/brew-math](https://github.com/cgbur/brew-math).\n\nThis tool is all about simplicity, there's no need to download an app or navigate through a complicated interface. I hope it proves to be helpful for your coffee brewing endeavors. If you have a chance to take a look, I would appreciate any feedback or suggestions for improvement. I only brew pour over (poorly), so if there are any other useful calculations you'd like to see, let me know and I'll be happy to add them.\n\nThanks!",

        "text": "I’m newer to the coffee game. I have been grinding beans from a local roaster and have loved their offerings. However, 1/10 cups, there is just a cup that is…wow. I can smell it after grinding the beans and before I place them in the filter…I know I’m about to have one of those “wow” cups.\n\nI am confident it is the grind that is maximizing my experience. So question:\n\nFor drip…what grinder or process should I follow to get that “wow” cup more often/consistently?",

For example, I heard that Yemen coffee is top tier, but since there's an ongoing war in the country there's just no way to export it. Can anyone confirm or deny it, or maybe someone tasted it? \n\nAlso today I stumbled upon Jamaican coffee online. Is it any good? \n\nMaybe there are other countries that you know which have coffee but it's not so widespread around the world for some reason?",

        "text": "I just got a bag of anaerobic natural process Ethiopian from Red Rooster.  I really like most of the flavors. It’s super fruity and a little chocolatey and unlike any coffee I’ve had before. I’ve been using an Aeropress. The first few brews had a distinct balsamic vinegar flavor, but I’ve since gotten rid of that by adjusting the recipe. Now I’m getting good cups, but it has a red wine note that I’m not a fan of. Is there anything I can try to mellow it out a little? Maybe resting it for a few more days?",
