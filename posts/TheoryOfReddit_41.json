        "text": "Every time Reddit decides to step in and take action against a subreddit (or network of them, in this case), the reactions are typical: \"This goes against Reddit's principles of free speech.\"; \"This is just an effort at increasing the marketability of a failing website.\"; \"Why haven't you taken action against [other subreddit]? Hypocrisy at its finest.\" While I think all of these complaints have a ring of truth, I also think everyone making them is missing the point - hard. Why are people mad at the fact that Reddit chose to ban FatPeopleHate and its ilk? That's not a rhetorical question. Really think hard about this one, because it's the same underlying reason they're mad at every change Reddit has made.\n\nIf you said, \"Because it's a slippery slope!\" or something similar to that, I'm sorry, but you're not approaching this the right way. At this point in your 'Reddit career', you've been trained to spot gradual changes and call them out, especially if you're the kind of person who subscribes to meta subreddits like TheoryOfReddit or Circlejerk/broke. You're rewiring your mind to analyze situations with the critical eye of an anthropologist, always looking at the big patterns in community changes and asking questions: \"How does a subreddit degrade in quality?\"; \"What makes a circlejerk so fervent?\"; \"Why does Reddit love this topic and hate that topic?\"; et cetera. And while this is a great way to figure out what makes Reddit tick in 'the big picture', it ignores a much bigger picture: the culture of the West and how it relates to free speech.\n\nYou're currently looking at Reddit policy like this, in a chronological order:\n\n* Baseline: Free speech as long as it's not illegal. \n* Modification 1: Free speech as long as it's not illegal or as long as it's not trampling on the rights of other subs to free speech - brigading, essentially.\n* Modification 2: Free speech as long as it's not illegal, brigading, or borderline illegal to the extent that it threatens the existence of the rest of the platform, and thus threatens other free speech.\n* Modification 3: Free speech as long as [see above reasons] but with a special emphasis on the sharing of illegally-obtained nude pictures being a bannable offense. Note that this is essentially the same thing as Modification 2, rephrased because of where media attention lies at that moment.\n* Modification 4: Free speech as long as [see above reasons] and as long as it's not harassing specific people. Note that this is actually a shift back to the baseline, because cyberbullying actually is illegal. Reddit admins found themselves stuck with a network of subreddits that essentially acted as hives for organized cyberbullying against specific individuals.\n\nThere's a fundamental error in looking at it this way, and it's easy to miss when you're caught up in the modifications: the very foundation of Reddit, that aforementioned baseline built on personal responsibility and freedom, has never existed in the way you imagined it did, and not because Reddit is a company that strives to make a profit at the end of the day. Sure, Reddit (the userbase, not the company) values free choice and personal responsibility, but only because it knows that it doesn't really have either. That's because every user is working under the (correct) assumption that they wouldn't be allowed to make truly dangerous, harmful choices (like posting child porn). And the userbase realizes that since it doesn't have *complete* autonomy, it doesn't have to accept *complete* responsibility since they're still abiding by rules set in place by the system, i.e. Reddit. Thus the anger when the system seems to turn against them. What I'm saying is that even though the baseline is technically true, it ignores the fact that by ever setting up a system, even one bound just by national law, the userbase unconsciously treats the boundaries that exist as the work of someone omnipotent.\n\nThat's right. If you think \"personal responsibility\" or \"freedom\" are reasonable rallying cries when the admins ban something, it's because you think of Reddit as an omnipotent entity. I know that sounds silly since you're criticizing their actions, but it's true. \"If FatPeopleHate were such a bad subreddit, Reddit would have never allowed it to exist in the first place, right? If FatPeopleHate already exists, it must be okay by whatever standard is in place!\" Thus the problem with screaming \"slippery slope\", a problem rooted in the way the West approaches the ideal of free speech: you think the slippery slope is what happens when the ambiguous entity of 'free speech' is slowly restricted by a system of people. But it's really just the opposite: a system of people are slowly being restricted by 'free speech' and are pushing back. Let me explain.\n\nIf all the FPH mods simultaneously had a change of heart and decided to delete the subreddit, no one would be angry. But when Reddit decided FPH was a threat that it somehow 'missed' initially before it banned the subreddit, we were pissed. But not because of 'corporate intrusion' or because we think our free speech is being threatened - rather, we're pissed because the system showed it wasn't infallible. We want Reddit to be reliable because, like any large system, we unconsciously treat it as a God, some kind of equilibrium-restoring law of nature. And even though Reddit is clearly not the perfect God we want it to be, it still maintains the appearance of an omnipotent entity because it has the three telltale characteristics:\n\n1. It sees everything.\n2. It's constantly shifting towards a state of 'order' (because it's always being moved around).\n3. It protects you from yourself.\n\nIf you're having trouble understanding this metaphor, replace the words 'Reddit' with 'free market' and 'FPH/subreddit' with 'dangerous toy/product'.\n\nI realize I'm getting abstract, but I promise this is relevant to the situation. Let's go back to the FPH ban. Is it Reddit intruding into what users are allowed to do? Should we be allowed to mock whomever we want? Important questions, but here's the question you should have asked:\n\n**To what extent am I free on Reddit?**\n\nThat is to say, what makes a choice a choice? Well, you don't get to make choices about everything in life, and especially on Reddit. You only get to make the choices that have been deemed safe enough for you to make. You can choose whether you want to subscribe to a subreddit. You can choose whether you want to engage in a discussion with a troll. You can choose whether you want to mod your subreddit with an iron fist. In the real world, you get to decide what kind of phone you buy, or whether you buy one at all. You get to decide what clothes you want to wear. You get to decide what books you want to read. You don't, however, get to decide whether the local power company can install power lines around your house. You don't get to decide whether airplanes can fly over your airspace. You don't get to decide whether your government will invade a country. (Whoa, better rein it in, I'm sounding political. I hope you got my point, though.)\n\nWhen you cry \"freedom of speech\" or \"personal responsibility\" or \"Laissez-faire!\", what you're really saying is, \"This is an issue of minor enough importance that I get to make it.\" Who told you this was (un)important enough for you to decide? The omnipotent entity: Reddit. The Reddit userbase collectively acts like the stereotypical teenager who is content to live under the roof and rules of their parents, entirely dependent on their provisions (food, water, bed, shower, TV, phone, internet, car, etc.), yet complains and cries \"Oppression!\" when the Xbox is taken away. The trick is that Redditors thought the Xbox was a sign of independence, as if every other aspect of their way of life (on Reddit) wasn't entirely out of their hands. They have no freedom and think they do, which makes the userbase much harder to deal with than one that always knew it didn't have that freedom in the first place.\n\nThis might sound like it's becoming a rant against the nanny state, but I'm honestly trying to place Reddit's collective illusion into a genuine theory, one that's always subject to change, like any proper theory should be. Reddit is a microcosm of Western society, and it suffers from the same flaws, namely the ideal of freedom usurping pragmatism, e.g. libertarian principles being trotted out when /r/jailbait is in the news. Please keep this mind the next time you get in a debate over free speech with a Redditor: *both of you want essentially the same thing: for that fictional baseline to exist.* If you blame FPH for harassing people, it's because you value the rules set in place by the system - don't break the law, and that includes cyberbullying! If you blame the people harassed by FPH, it's because you value the rules set in place by the system - you have the right to free speech, even if people get their feelings hurt! Either way, you're validating the system by presuming that the baseline existed. And that's a problem when both sides agree that the system has huge flaws.\n\nTo summarize: Redditors are not 100% free. The fact that they know this influences how they behave, even if they weren't going to break the rules anyway. This is because they now operate under the assumption that there's something looking out for them, something that protects them from their own bad behavior. Knowing this, they look at what choices are placed in front of them rather than what non-choices are all around them. The choices are provisions that they overvalue and credit themselves for because they're the ones making the choices. The non-choices are provisions that they take for granted because they didn't have a role in their creation. This results in a collective doublethink where Redditors must be aware of and enjoy the regulations imposed on them (e.g. admins prevent spam and virus links from being posted) while simultaneously applauding their sense of personal responsibility (e.g. they don't click spam and virus links). Never mind that the reason they don't click those links is because of the regulations. The whole point is that the regulatory power is supposed to be invisible so Redditors can disavow it. When the powers that be make themselves known, the illusion shatters and people get angry.\n\nReddit is making pretend choices, but that doesn't mean they're not proud of them.",

        "text": "I want to preface this post by saying that my focus is to pose a question for discussion rather than provide any immediate answers. Here at ToR I find a committed group of individuals discussing the mechanics and processes instrumental to reddit's success, as opposed to personal sentiment or otherwise blatanly subjective opinion. \n\nMy question assesses the recent administrative decision to curtail the support or establishment of potentially inflammatory behavior through a fundamental theory of reddit itself. I therefore ask: what is Reddit? In answering this definitionally, I believe that Reddit is first and foremost a company that features a management system responsible for major decisions sitewide. In this sense, from the very top, it is _not_ democratic. I take no stance on democracy either way, but I do believe that reddit's current management structure validates its decision.\n\n______\n\nFollowing a [string](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/06/10/these-are-the-5-subreddits-reddit-banned-under-its-game-changing-anti-harassment-policy-and-why-it-banned-them/) of [recent](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/10/reddit-bans-five-subreddits-harrassment-concerns) [events](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-32749408), the site's apparent leader has been elevated in the [spotlight](http://www.reddit.com/r/punchablefaces). Interestingly, there has been far-reaching community backlash elsewhere, with [numerous](http://www.reddit.com/r/FatPeopleHate5) [attempts](http://www.reddit.com/r/FatPeopleHate6) to circumvent the current action.\n\nMy question to ToR over recent events is this. Should Reddit™ have any claim over the conduct of its members and communities independent of how our government establishes and protects regulation over speech?\n\nIn the case of Reddit [or, COMPANY] vs. user base [or, CLIENTS, et al], which theoretical argument holds supremacy. \n\nMy belief is that as a company, reddit is free to do whatever it wants, with the understanding that its choices affect things like user experience, loyalty, and exclusivity. At the same time, all conduct in this country, regardless of intent has an unregulated status until otherwise questioned.\n\nRecently, an [issue](http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/01/politics/supreme-court-elonis-facebook-ruling/) of [comparable](http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/supreme-court-case-tests-the-limits-of-free-speech-on-facebook-and-other-social-media/2014/11/23/9e54dbd8-6f67-11e4-ad12-3734c461eab6_story.html) relevance was brought before the Supreme Court, in which they ruled in favor of speech and conduct protection.\n\n____\nPut simply, should Reddit abide to a _community of users_ consensus standard (not universally, instead on a case-by-case basis focusing solely upon subreddit communities i.e., if the community wants the sub, the community gets the sub), or is it justified in its taking an active role in limiting what it considers or allows as acceptable as it pertains to speech and conduct on its sites and communities?",

        "text": "(I wrote this post for a meta discussion subreddit but realized it also belongs here. I have edited it from its original form to be more fitting to the rules and spirit of this subreddit.)\n\n---\n\nThe recent [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/39bpam/removing_harassing_subreddits/) on r/announcements, even only 2 hours in, has been heavily downvoted and has started a firestorm of controversy.\n\nTo me, the bannings and the post they made were a very strange decision. There have been rumblings and dissatisfaction all over the site. There is a perception the admins, especially Ellen Pao, are taking an editorial role in reddit's content, removing and discouraging things they think to be offensive, censoring things critical of them, and are unduly influenced by SJWs and SRS.\n\nSo with those sorts of comments and sentiments being highly upvoted and there being all sorts of conspiracy theories, why would the admins do something like this which is likely to be ill received and fan the flames? I saw zero attempts to address user concerns in the body of that r/announcement post. My theory:\n\n**The current crop of admins is hopelessly out of touch**\n\nThe community management side of reddit has been poorly handled for a long time. The people who dealt directly with the community were not the people who seemed to be making policy decisions, and there were never enough community managers to answer user mails in a timely manner, if at all. Yishan caused a big shakeup in the reddit workplace. His insistence that all reddit employees be in the same office caused a lot of great people to leave the company, including veteran community manager cupcake1713. Then he left too, and reddit scrambled to find a new direction and a new CEO. (And a new head of community management).\n\nI have no idea how or why Ellen Pao was chosen as CEO. She seems to have had zero interaction with the reddit community. The blog post says she worked for two years in the company before stepping in as interim CEO, but it's not entirely clear what her role was. As far as I can tell, she never had experience dealing directly with the community. \n\nEllen Pao became controversial on reddit once people began chattering about her lawsuit. The conspiracy theories underlie deeper concerns: Who is this person? Does she understand the community? If she doesn't, is she fit to lead?\n\nPao has responded to zero these concerns. I don't even know if she's aware of them.\n\nThe other two names signing that post were Jessica Moreno (5days) and Alexis Ohanian (kn0thing). 5days was an employee of the redditgifts division. She was never a part of the r/reddit.com community management team that directly interfaced with the community. So when she was appointed to head that team, it was a department she had zero experience in. She was appointed in favor of people that were already there and had experience, and became their boss.\n\nAlexis Ohanian was one of the founders of reddit. iAfter reddit was sold, he stepped down from his (informal) role as the head and started a new project, breadpig. He left the company in 2010. When the board was formed, he became a member, but did not return as an employee. He rejoined the team once yishan left. He is less of an outsider than 5days or Ellen Pao, but still an outsider.\n\n(If I got any of these details wrong please correct me)\n\nSo the people who signed this post, the people in charge of making decisions, have not had a finger on the pulse of the site's community. They don't seem to understand why the team's recent actions aren't going over well, nor do they seem to care. \n\nI believe they are trying to carry the userbase, kicking and screaming, into a new direction.\n\n**Is this a bad thing?**\n\nI'm not so sure. For such a popular and highly trafficked site, the amount of hate, abuse, and awfulness on reddit is unprecedented. Twitter and facebook and the like also have a lot of awfulness, but what set reddit apart is that such awfulness is allowed. (Where as other sites will deal with it as it is reported, depending on their manpower).\n\nUnder the new team, this is changing. [This](http://www.redditblog.com/2015/05/promote-ideas-protect-people.html) blog post of kn0thing says\n\n&gt;TL;DR: We are unhappy with harassing behavior on reddit; we have survey data that show our users are, too. So we’ve improved our practices to better curb harassment of individuals on reddit.\n\nThe question is, what users? Who really is the reddit userbase? This whole time I've been talking as if it is the commenters. But most redditors lurk. The commenters were quite unhappy with the blog post, despite kn0thing saying he was acting on behalf of what usesr want. Is it the lurkers, (who make up the majority of the userbase anyway) he was pleasing? Is the dissent on reddit artificial because most people visiting the site don't read it, let alone participate in it?",

        "text": "I am actually quite astounded by the, in my opinion, massive hypocrisy that a huge amount of redditors show.\n\nUsually when you call out a subreddit or a thread for spewing a lot of BS then you are quickly slammed down. Someone really edgy will near instantaneously creep up with a comment that is essentially a copy-paste of\n\n&gt; This is a huge generalization, reddit is not one person.\n\nThis will then skyrocket in upvotes because the statement is not a terribly bad argument until you consider the actual dynamics of this website. \n\nPosts that are on the frontpage have obviously been lifted up there by a big amount of voting people. Thus you can say that they reflect commonly held opinions. \n\nOf course those opinions aren't shared by everyone and reddit is also divided into partially antagonistic communities (SRS vs ...anything for example). But the opinions appear to be shared by enough people to push it to the frontpage. What cements my opinion that the reddit community is hugely hypocritical (again, not a statement about individuals) are posts like the following:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/393rfd/redditer_complains_about_neighbors_having_loud/\n\nThis was /r/bestof mind you. And on the frontpage with 2600+ upvotes. At the same time you go into any news, gaming or tech sub and all that you hear is lamenting about privacy invasions. ",

        "text": "We've all seen users delete or edit content for 'damage control' or similar reasons related to karma (some of us might have even done this ourselves). But has anyone ever seen someone deleting or editing their comments when they are supposedly 'winning' the karma war?\n\nI recently posted a [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/390ppr/i_am_dr_claire_simeone_of_the_marine_mammal/crzhfe6) in /r/science/ on an AMA and the user who responded to me gained more support than I did, but then deleted their comments for some strange reason. It can't have been because they were losing karma, because they weren't, but I suppose there's a possibility that they thought their comments were wrong in some way or otherwise no longer wished to stand by them. I can't think of many other good reasons, but I'd be interested to know whether others could share any further insight into why someone would wish to delete/edit their content.\n\nBeyond this I have begun thinking about the general philosophies people have behind editing and deleting content on Reddit. I, for one, use my real initials and surname, and can't remember ever deleting anything. I do this because I consider privacy somewhat archaic and would rather have a public record of bettering myself through debate and discourse than a pretending I have a flawless record and have never, ever been mean or nasty or wrong in any way, etc.\n\nI'm probably in a minority in holding this philosophy, however.\n\nSome questions:\n\n* What editing/deleting philosophy to you subscribe to?\n* Which should Reddit technically support or favour (keeping in mind that it can't avoid supporting or favouring *a* philosophy - currently I would say it supports/favours a 'literal retraction/correction possible without record but not always effective' philosophy)?\n* Should or does using your real name incur some benefits?\n* Should anonymity be the status quo (I noticed that YouTube now prefers users to show their real name, and from anecdotal evidence it seems people are less likely to engage in petty name-calling when using their real identities)?\n\nFor a backlog of discussion on these general topics:\n\n* http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1jveiy/ive_been_a_user_for_almost_3_years_now_should_i/\n* http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/iuptc/problem_negative_karma_encourages_people_to/\n* http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1ao3zf/should_uneditreddit_be_allowed_and_does_its/\n\n**EDIT:** As it turns out, it was not actually the user who deleted their posts but a moderator of /r/science/.

        "text": "This seems to be the implied view of a lot of people. You've probably heard a line like this before:\n\n&gt; lol, you spend your time arguing on the internet\n\nBut I don't think this is a defensible viewpoint, because:\n\n1. The act of arguing is essential to discovering truth anyway. Critical thought (aka argumentation) is the act of arguing with yourself and/or others, so you're going to argue with *someone* if you're going to examine a belief in some way.\n\n2. The structure of in-person conversations is insanely ill-suited to argumentation.\n\nThe first issue with in-person arguments is pragmatic: discussions in-person tend to be really trivial, because very few people are okay with being confrontational in real life, and most people would rather discuss agreeable things like the weather or what you had for breakfast or what your plans are for the evening.\n\nIn-person discussion also have a temporal issues: you can't actually go back and check what was said. I've jokingly abused this in discussions before, like this --\n\n&gt; A: Well, 20% of our brains are made of hormones.\n\n&gt; B: What? No they aren't.\n\n&gt; A: Aren't what?\n\n&gt; B: Made of hormones.\n\n&gt; A: Where'd you get that from?\n\n&gt; B: You said that earlier.\n\n&gt; A: No I didn't. Where did you hear that?\n\n&gt; B: You just said 20% of our brains are made of hormones.\n\n&gt; A: I don't remember saying that at all, honestly. Can you prove that?\n\n&gt; B: Well, no.\n\n&gt; A: Okay, I really think you should just keep the discussion to things we can prove. Anyway, 20% of our brains are made of hormones.\n\n&gt; B: There!! You said it again!\n\n&gt; A: Said what?\n\n&gt; B: That 20% of our brains are made of hormones.\n\n&gt; A: I honestly don't remember saying that.\n\n&gt; B: What?!?!?! That's so dumb.\n\n&gt; A: I know, I'm kidding. It *is* really dumb, isn't it?\n\nAnother issue in real-life discussions is that relevance is time-based; something you discussed 5 minutes ago might not be a subject of conversation now, because people tend to discuss things that are relevant to them at any given time. This is an issue because conversational relevance does not determine epistemic relevance -- something does not cease to alter a claim's rightness or wrongness because it was made too late or too early. And if you try to import this model to the internet (that there is some kind of time limit that determines the epistemic relevance of a claim) you look as stupid as someone saying that copying files is 'stealing' them, because you're trying to import a model of physical interaction that simply doesn't exist in this medium. \n\nAnd yet another issue might be that you cannot pursue multiple conversations or claims concurrently. In real life your statements need to be linear and you can only talk while someone else is not talking. On the internet there is no limitation to this; you can make a post while someone else is making a post, and you can respond to multiple claims at the same time. If someone makes fallacious reasoning in a real-life discussion, I need to take up conversational time to point this out, *then* proceed to the point I am making. On the internet this is merely a detour and doesn't affect much.\n\nThe only medium for in-person discussion I could see a person defending is classroom discussions, but I don't think those are of much merit. They still face temporal issues as internet discussions do; further, I remember having classroom discussions at fairly selective colleges and most of the time people who dominated these discussions were people who would prefer to argue on the internet anyway, because they were people with a lot to say and as such would take up a lot of conversational time. Most students went along with it because they just wanted to get the discussion over with and didn't actually care.\n\nI think the view that internet discussions are superficial, or trivial, or whatever and should be disregarded on the basis of their medium is based on assumptions that are indefensible when challenged.\n\nBut the view that the internet is a horrible place for discussion persists. I think it does so because if you look at any discussion on the internet, most people tend to revert to \"u r a fag\" levels of disagreement pretty quickly.\n\nIf they're doing that on the internet, I suspect most people think something along the lines of \"u r a fag\" in-person and translate it into socially acceptable speech. In the event that they are uncomfortable with confrontation, they will merely say something like \"you don't know what you're talking about\" or \"I don't have time for this, bye\" even if they clearly do have time for it. After all, if someone is having an in-person discussion with you it means you are actually in some physical location and have a reason for being there, so most avenues give you a socially understandable reason for opting out of a conversation. In the least-avoidable scenario (an argument at your house) you could just say you're tired, or put off the discussion, or whatever. There are countless avenues for avoiding any kind of substantial discussion.\n\nSo, it may just so happen to be the case that the internet is a place where we can engage our more controversial viewpoints, and since people never engage controversial viewpoints to begin with, they don't know what happens when they have to give their actual defense of their viewpoints.  Anecdotally, when I used to tutor college writing and make very average college students defend their views on paper, they would have not even the slightest idea of where to start with a sincere defense of what they believed. If they were writing a paper on abortion for example, they would say something like \"abortion is murder\" and that would be the extent of their argument. I have no doubt that if this person went on the internet, they'd merely translate this into \"abortion is murder u r dumb &amp; a fag!!!\" or something. The addition of \"u r a fag\" makes their argument more rude, but they'd still have a horrible argument if they weren't being rude.\n\nSo, most people think that the internet is bad for discussions because most people on the internet look like idiots when discussing things. But those are people who would look like idiots in real life anyway; they're just more upfront about what they think, and you probably aren't in many situations where regular people are forced to give actual defenses of their beliefs, since very few scenarios in real life actually require that, and when they do it's very occupation-specific (\"why did you believe x that led to mistake y at workplace z?\")\n\nIn actuality, the internet might be thoroughly superior for substantial discussions, and bias against this medium might only exist because people in general are horrible at having discussions about anything substantial whatsoever and this is more evident on the internet; in fact, it might be one of the best media we have.",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/388gs7/why_democratic_policy_making_cant_work_a_response/",
        "text": "[Source Link] (https://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueOfMeta/comments/388g6n/why_democratic_policy_making_cant_work/) Credits to our head moderator for making this post /u/BuckeyeSundae\n\n***\n\nLately we've been having a lot of discussion (internally and with the community generally) about trying to make the rules a closer fit for the needs of the subreddit.  I think that discussion is good and healthy, but one argument keeps popping up that i think needs to be treated in critical detail.  Primarily: the argument that we should rely on \"what the community wants\" to be rules.\n\nTo be blunt: there is no coherent entity called \"the community\" that we can rely on for making any rules.  The face and makeup of the community varies too rapidly from a day-to-day basis. Trying to rely primarily or exclusively on the people who come to the subreddit to decide what should be our ruleset is a recipe for disaster or political gamemanship.\n\nTo the evidence.\n\n---\n\n###How to figure out what a majority wants\n\n(tl;dr: Most users don't care; fewer still will tell us what they think.  Assuming that the vocal minority reflects the majority is ridiculous and will change rapidly from day-to-day based on the climate of the moment.)\n\nBefore I get too far into more abstract thoughts, I'll run right into the statistical reality of the impossible task that is figuring out what a \"majority\" of the community wants.\n\n[Our subreddit gets about 9 million unique visitors every month](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/about/traffic).  We see about 8-10% of our total monthly users every day.  Over a week period, we see about 30-40% of the entire subreddit's monthly users (the estimated range here is because this stat is harder to suss out without coming back on the 7th of every month to check the total monthly uniques tally).\n\nOne week is not enough time for a \"majority\" of the monthly uniques to see the poll.  One week is enough time to get about 3 to 4 million users through the subreddit.  Of those 3-4 million users, how many do you suppose will vote?\n\nThe answer for our mod-free week poll: 24,000.  That **response rate was 0.6-0.8%** (depending on how many uniques came through).  Barely 1% of all users that could have seen the poll even clicked the googlelink to see what the poll contained.\n\nSo who are these 1%?  We'll see a few power users, and a few more regulars, but the largest group will be emotionally-driven voters.  That last group should draw some attention. \n\nWith self-selected polls, the biggest problem that undermines their ability to reflect the population as a whole is the fact that people who are emotionally attached to the subject of the poll are far more likely to respond than people with neutral views (creating bias in the net result that differs from what the \"majority\" believes).  If the subject changes, so does the population that would respond to the poll.  And when we're already dealing with less than 1% of the total userbase, you can bet your ass that opinion will change pretty rapidly based on the biggest news of the day.\n\nWhat's more, **time matters.  A lot.**  Every poll's curve will look a [lot like this](http://i.imgur.com/7aOEzGw.jpg).  About 70-80% of the total responders will have responded in the first 24 hours.  Most of our users are NOT daily visitors.  They are casual forum goers looking for some league-related news, discussion, or entertainment.  So the population that responds will be different based on what day of the week we put it up, too.\n\nThere is no way to randomize the poll to give it to all of our users in a way that we can hope we'll get a reasonable cross sample of the userbase.  We can't time it.  We can't control the emotional variant.  We can't hope to get a random sample to extrapolate what the community wants.  The best we can do is hope the emotional reaction reflects what the majority thinks--which we know is a farse because an overwhelming majority doesn't care enough to notice or vote (99.2%, for those counting at home). \n\nTherefore, there is zero way to logically argue that the \"majority\" wants any singular policy change.  Nobody can know that without jumping into the minds of millions of people, the overwhelming majority of whom don't tell us what they think unless they are emotionally invested in the topic.  No vote can adequately account for the opinions of millions of users that use our subreddit.\n\n---\n\n###Good luck designing polls to match the range of views\n\nThe most common protest in the comments thread [of our announced vacation](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/376fe2/psa_community_sprayed_a_major_can_of_modsbgone/) was a reprise of something we saw in the initial poll: the options were shit compared to what some people wanted.  \n\nThe critics of the mod-free week protested by arguing that they wanted only slightly less strict rules, not for us to leave entirely. They might also have wanted only RL's content to be unbanned, or for whatever their pet topic is to be changed (I saw a lot of people complaining about the \"no jokes\" rule, some were complaining about \"relevance,\" others still complained that server status threads should be allowed).  The point is, many users argued for only slight changes to the current ruleset, any many different small changes were being argued for.  They were loud and prominent in the comment section of the initial poll with the same criticism.\n\nYes, in our poll about whether or not we should take a break from moderating, people were upset that they couldn't tell us in the poll that we were doing a shitty job.  These are people who wanted to subvert the purpose of the poll we provided to give feedback about a different topic.  That attribute won't just go away as we continue using this meta sub.  It will happen any time an emotional issue explodes regarding the subreddit.\n\n---\n\n###Complexity Will Not Scale\n\nFor a really long ass time, our rules have been made as specific attempts to address specific problems that we saw popping up in the subreddit, as they popped up.  Images as self posts, Acronyms in titles, front page edits, Server Status threads, etc.  The net effect was a complex set of rules that were specifically tailored to address specific issues that almost no one reads and even fewer people understand.\n\nWhat happens when the mods try to simplify those rules?  We disagree about how far the rules should go, and so we keep the more complex set because we each have different visions for what the subreddit should be.  This is the reason for why every time we talk about reworking the rules it seems like it takes forever for us to move anywhere on the topic.  Different people think differently about what the ideal ruleset should be.\n\nWe mods kept the complex set because we could at least agree to that, even if we all know it is full of clarity and consistency problems.  All of this notion of relying on the what the community wants is shifting the burden from what SHOULD be the moderator's domain to what is impossible to divine and will constantly change.  The moderators would be running from our internal disagreements to try to let someone else deal with them.  That rationale is irresponsible.\n\nThink about that disagreement scaled up to the millions of users that come to the subreddit.  How the hell are we supposed to find a suitable way forward if the rationale for our making policy is \"what the community wants\" and the community very visibly disagrees with itself? (Remember that polls aren't really an option because emotional investment changes with every news cycle.)\n\nWhat is likely to happen is two big camps will form around most issues: the camp that wants something to be done and the camp that doesn't.  The middleground where reasonable people do work is likely to get crushed by the scale of how many people involve themselves.  And if we are clear enough about relying on what the community wants as a motive for policy making, more and more people will try to use that fact to their advantage to try to inflate the number that hold their position.\n\n---\n\n###What is the alternative?\n\nThe primary alternative to this farcical attempt to read tea leaves is to try to do what we think is best for the subreddit (and to be humble enough to recognize when we might be wrong about what is best).  Of course feedback from the community is absolutely crucial to improving the subreddit.  The more people looking over a policy trying to improve it, the better a fit that policy should be for the subreddit as a whole.  Programmers use this theory all the time when they make code open source.  But let's not confuse that for uncritically relying on what the community wants to be policy.  That is impossible to know and even worse to pretend to know.  We should be looking for the highest quality feedback, not the feedback with the highest quantity.  There can be no replacement for critical thinking when it comes to policy making.\n\nThe main group of people who will use this argument seriously to argue for specific policy changes are people who have deluded themselves into thinking that the community supports what they personally believe.  It is a politician's trick to use democracy to try to enact policy when there is no evidence to support the notion.  We are not politicians and the LAST thing I want is for this subreddit to become *more* political in how we decide what content belongs and what content does not.\n\nI want us moderators to be listening for compelling arguments, not for what \"the people\" think should be policy on the heels of some vasilli shirtless thread reaching the front page.  The best way to improve the subreddit is through careful consideration, not mindless adherence to the will of the masses.",

If i'm totally honest i was expecting either no responses or a bunch of snarky messages from users that didn't want to give up their sub that they haven't touched for 3+ years. \n\nSo anyway now that i've got a subreddit to work with it got me thinking and so far this is the concept i have come up with for a subreddit dedicated solely to recommendation questions with the 3 possible tags to add to your title, RMA, DYR and IRY.\n\n***\n\n**It's quite a simple concept:**\n\n* RMA = Recommend Me A\n* DYR = Do You Recommend\n* IRY = I Recommend You\n\n***\n**Examples of such titles could be:**\n\n*RMA good sci-fi book* - a quite broad request.\n\n*DYR the book Ender's Game?* - a more direct request.\n\n*IRY read the book Ender's Game.* - a direct recommendation.\n\n***\n\nMy questions to /r/TheoryOfReddit is what do you think of this idea?

This makes sense as reddit becomes more popular and users of a particular product want to communicate with each other. These users can discuss the product, share related content, and help each other with support questions. Any smart business would encourage this, unless they are in the business of screwing over their customer.\r\n\r\nA lot of brands have noticed their own subreddits and are even sending representatives to participate in the community. /r/XboxOne and /r/GoPro are two examples that come to mind. Reps from each community will respond to questions and suggestions in their respective communities and I think if you polled each community, they would have a positive experience with this. But just like [pressiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/pressiquette) for journalists, do we need a broader set of guidelines for anyone that is representing a brand in an honest and authentic way?\r\n\r\nI think this has been overlooked because reddit has this attitude that no one should be marketing on reddit, but I would argue that this is a narrow-minded view of marketing. Marketing is fundamentally about listening to your customers and that is a good thing that reddit facilitates very well. It's funny because some companies will spend thousands on building a community for their customers and many brands have gotten that for free via a grassroots-created subreddit.\r\n\r\nI wonder if the reddit admins recognize how valuable these communities are to the brands and their customers. I'm not sure how reddit could leverage that value or profit from it, but they should protect it by recognizing it and encouraging it. Encouraging it with abandon would be dangerous, so it would be wise to create some type of document that explains to brands what is and is not kosher.\r\n\r\nI'm interested in anyones thoughts on the subject of brand subreddits and brand reps participating in their subreddits. If you have an example of a brand rep doing something really cool or not cool in a sub you subscribe to, please share it.",

Opposing views that are supported by an abundance of empirical evidence tend to do well, or at least for the the subs that I follow. Reductive (oversimplification) arguments, sweeping generalizations, obv. logical fallacies, grandiose claims, immaturity (that isn't funny or clever), too much idealism, and overuse of superlatives are often met with downvotes. Not getting a joke or missing the point of a post will also result in many downvotes. Before hitting submit, ask yourself, how can my post be countered? Do I understand the OP completely? (it always helps to completely read the article if one is attached) You have to write and think like a lawyer, weighing both sides and writing a cogent level-minded response; writing like an ignoramus/ideologue/talking head will probably get you negged.

        "text": "I may turn this into an actual article somewhere (if I do, it'll be [here](http://www.alfredmacdonald.com)), but until then this is just a dump of my thoughts. If you want to help me revise this, feel free to disagree or tell me whatever you think about this subject period, whether it's \"I agree\" or \"I disagree because x.\" I'm helped by criticism as always, but I'm not a mindreader, so if you disagree or think I suck please say why.\n\n---\n\nLet's start with a very basic question. What is karma?\n\nIf you said \"internet points\", you are technically correct, but here's a more important question: what does karma *do*?\n\nVotes determine what gets seen and what doesn't. I submitted a YouTube video of my friend playing a video game and it got 30 upvotes, but 5,000 views. I've used 1 upvote = 100 views as a rule for a while, and it's been fairly reliable. Views determine what kind of content gets circulated, which determines who makes money. Views also determine what ideas people are exposed to and influenced by, which in turn determines how they will attempt to change the minds of others concerning those ideas. Karma is the currency of attention and influence.\n\nThere is a huge incentive to game websites like this one, and pretending otherwise deliberately weakens your voting strategy. I've been using and commenting on reddit for about 8 years and have used other vote-based discussion forums like Disqus for a few years also. I'm extremely aware of how systems like these are gamed, and want to share this knowledge with you. I'm reluctant, because the presumption is that if I know how this stuff works, I've done it. However, I think it's better that we know the flaws inherent in vote media than to ignore them because people who point out these flaws might be vote manipulators.\n\nMy most absurd accomplishment concerning planned frontpaging (without any vote manipulation involved) was when I made a bet with my friend Ryan that Obama was going to win the 2012 election. I had predicted Obama was going to win 2008 as well under the reasoning that the public wanted something as superficially different from Bush as possible and Obama was about as superficially different as you could get. I was right about this, but got no credit for it, so I wanted to make sure my prediction was memorialized. My friend Ryan thought Perry was going to win the 2012 republican nomination because of his economic background. I argued that this assumes the public is capable of doing active research, nevermind weighing pros and cons of something like economic growth, and that there's no way they're that smart -- witness how insignificant foreign policy is in voting decisions, even though it should be a bigger issue all things considered. Additionally I argued that Perry was going to lose because, well, he's made careless mistakes in the past. I argued that Romney was going to win the nomination, because he's the only candidate so boring that no one can find anything wrong with him and *this* is also why he'd lose to Obama, because his boring flavor does not evoke excitement from people who aren't diehard republicans and during presidential elections people tend to vote for the incumbent president anyway unless they're a total disaster -- but Obama has the \"first black president\" handle and voters are obviously going to want to keep that running, because ultimately identity politics trumps everything else.\n\nSo, I made this account -- \"MittRomneysCampaign\" -- and waited a year. [This is my top comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/12rv4e/congratulations_to_barack_obama_the_44th/c6xmczi).\n\nPeople who know me personally think I can engineer this stuff out of thin air. Let me be clear: **you cannot push dogshit to the top of reddit.** I knew this type of joke lands with reddit's crowd because after enough exposure to an audience you can see the audience as a single entity and get a sense for what it likes, as a blob. The comment rose organically. I did not manipulate it.\n\nHowever, you can push kind-of-good-but-not-great stuff to the top of reddit. This happens all the time. There is a lot of money in it. A frontpage spot can mean 300,000 views. I interned at a marketing firm that hired people to write blogs maximizing SEO; this is called \"content marketing.\" Their *entire company blog* was filled with SEO and they barely broke 200k views after months if not years of writing it.\n\nRedditors are often shocked at the dishonesty that goes on in the corporate world, but I think that's because so many redditors work as programmers, which is comparatively way more honest than most professions. If you deal with people for a living, you're usually dealing with bullshit, because most people are bullshit factories.\n\nIf you think vote manipulation is bad, check this out: one writer (content marketer) in particular would google scientific studies in favor of some product he was hired to promote for a client and use the uncertain language common to scientific studies (\"may do x\") to say, effectively, \"you should take [product], it couldn't hurt.\" He was paid something like $60,000/year to do this, and this is in a city where you can rent a single bedroom apartment for $500. At one point I tested the values of this company by making a fake Facebook account to promote content, which was \"dishonest\" (I agree, and I'm glad they opposed this) -- but apparently it wasn't dishonest to make up quotes for a press release and attribute it to a person. If you've read [Paul Graham's article](http://www.paulgraham.com/submarine.html) about PR firms generating stories for newspapers, like the \"dad bod\" craze, this is truer than you could ever imagine. Wikipedia overwhelmingly considers articles from organizations \"reliable\" and articles from individuals \"not reliable\" -- note that these are the same organizations where a PR person calls up a friend and contrives a story. There is nothing reliable about this. As an aside, this is when I realized I didn't want to work in marketing.\n\n**Forced frontpaging** is when you do exactly that: get a shit ton of people to force something to the frontpage. This is extremely obvious, and smart people will catch on to its obviousness.\n\n**Vote nudging** is perhaps the most common type of vote manipulation on reddit. I'm hesitant to call it \"manipulation\" because I don't think it is; the submission is still very much vulnerable to dying. Vote nudging happens when someone arranges themselves or a few other people to give a link a boost of upvotes during its initial appearance on a subreddit, and then leave the link to grow organically.\n\nVote nudging is extremely successful because the first five upvotes are the most influential portion of a link's lifespan, because when a link has one vote you can kill 100% of its votes by downvoting it. However, when a link has five upvotes a new downvote might knock it off by a few positions. So, the vast majority of links will die in the first few upvotes. You might think of it as surviving infant mortality -- once children *don't* die from the vast majority of death-causing things, their life expectancy rockets forward. They can still die, but they've survived most of the things that would kill them.\n\nThis effect is even greater once you get to the top 50, and even further once you hit the top 25. The vast majority of people do not browse to the 2nd page, and even less to the 3rd, so this arrangement severely determines what links will stay on top once they *are* on top. A link on the first 25 has such an advantage over the second 25 that once a link gets to the top 20 it's unlikely to drop from that spot until reddit's vote fuzzing takes effect.\n\nVote nudging is difficult to call manipulation because (a) it's very easy to organize and (b) this is undoubtedly common practice at countless marketing firms that promote their content. I have organically gotten content to the top of /r/politics and /r/funny, but have never broken /r/videos. I would be surprised if the majority of successful links on /r/videos and /r/pics *weren't* nudged in some way -- there is enormous incentive for marketing firms to do so, since even 30 upvotes on your link can mean 5,000 views.\n\n**Reverse-nudging** is more insidious and it's when you vote negatively to all content blocking your link's position to a higher page. So let's say your link is 40th -- you'd downvote the 10 submissions above 40, with a few selective upvotes here and there so that your votes are not obviously in one direction out of self-interest. This would probably rise you to the 35th spot, and all you'd need is a few lucky votes to push you to 25th and then you're golden.\n\nI used to suspect the reddit engine would catch on to this, but I don't think it does, surprisingly. Reverse-nudging is to my knowledge allowed under the normal rules.\n\n**Visibility manipulation** or **puppeteering** (whichever you like better, I'm just making up terms to describe stuff that doesn't have terms to describe it) is vote manipulation in a different way. It's usually the product of a brigade because it's difficult for a single person to pull off. Most brigades will just downvote something, but the more intelligent ones will manipulate visibility in a way that bolsters the marketing of their view.\n\nLet's say you have this discussion:\n\n&gt; A: What happens to Anita Sarkeesian is an example of the harassment and misogyny that occurs so often in the gaming community.\n\n&gt; B: Get raped, you dumb bitch.\n\nNow, \"B\" would be downvoted in any normal discussion. This is either an angry irrational person (among other things) or a troll. I suspect actual trolls are far less common than people think. But anyway, the point is \"B\" would be downvoted.\n\nNow, say you are A. There are several ways you can take this interaction.\n\nIf you think like most people I know, you will see your discussion as an interaction with you and another person and that's it. I've heard so many people say \"well, you can't convince that person, so there's no use.\"\n\nBut if you are smart, or good at this, or both, you will see this as public speaking. You are interacting with one person, and you have hundreds (potentially thousands) of people viewing your interaction. In other words, you are not writing or voting for B, you are voting for **every person who views the discussion** and how they view the discussion determines what they're going to think when they walk away from reading it. So, as A, you actually *have an interest in receiving replies like B* because they are the types of comments you're saying are extremely common. So, instead of downvoting B, you will keep B right at -3 or -4 and upvote A as much as possible so that A's comment (with the reply from B) is the first thing people see. For added effect you can make a third commenter, C, to make the claim more explicit:\n\n&gt; A: What happens to Anita Sarkeesian is an example of the harassment and misogyny that occurs so often in the gaming community.\n\n&gt; B: Get raped, you dumb bitch.\n\n&gt; C: Wow, you couldn't have proved A's point more. This is disgusting. The gaming community needs to do something about this or it won't have women in it for long.\n\nThe ideal vote distribution to maximize A's point would be something like --\n\nA: +200\n\nB: -3 (just above the downvote threshold)\n\nC: +100\n\nTypically, you need to have a few people who (1) understand this phenomenon, and (2) are all willing to vote this way, so this is much harder to pull off. I suspect this happens in **many** private subreddits across reddit -- way, way more than you realize. But how, when brigading is banned? Well, brigading is only banned to the extent that the bans are enforced. Plus, you don't need to tell people to vote this way on reddit, and if you aren't explicitly saying \"go downvote this\", brigading is harder to prove. Further, people only need to internalize this voting lesson once and once they do, they know the routine well enough where they don't need anyone to repeat it to them. Once a lot of people understand *how* to vote, you can just link them a discussion and they'll vote this way.\n\nWhy does this work?\n\nHere is something you need to understand about reddit:\n\n1. The number of people who don't read the article and \"skip to the comments\" is immense, and people who do this register upvotes as some kind of truth rating (as opposed to \"content we want you to see\" rating). This viewpoint could not be more erroneous, but vote manipulation exploits people who think this way.\n\n2. People use upvotes as an \"I agree\" button -- they do, and they will continue to, and no amount of telling them to do differently will change this until you actively micromanage voting privileges, and people who vote this way also tend to *read* votes this way.\n\n3. People are influenced by content they see, and are very lazy readers. As such, when they are only exposed to a few viewpoints, they'll just go with whatever they know.\n\n4. In conjunction with (3), people don't tend to read the whole discussion, so a completely crushing counterargument could be at +1 or +2 forever.\n\n5. [Asch conformity experiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments). If conformity pressure can delude someone about the size of lines right in front of their face, they can be influenced by a number telling them that they're disagreeing with 1000 people.\n\nIf you think this is not true, let me tell you a story from 8 years ago. I hope the admins or reddit staff will not take issue with me telling this story, because this happened eight years ago and this is longer than the statute of limitations on some real crimes people can go to jail for.\n\nI was about 18. I was very new to reddit, and vote manipulation wasn't acknowledged by anyone. I am familiar with psychometrics, and I am familiar with how psychometrics is perceived by other people. The default cultural position is that you have complete control over your intellectual destiny, which psychometrics contradicts, and that this has nothing to do with heredity, which psychometrics contradicts, and that IQ is meaningless or just a test of pointless puzzles, which psychometrics contradicts. But it's very difficult to convey these positions over reddit, because the default cultural position is extremely attractive -- why wouldn't it be, since you're telling people they have *more* agency and capability? No one wants to hear \"actually, you might be extremely limited in some respects. Also, don't have babies with an idiot or they'll be dumb babies.\"\n\nSo, to see if I could get reddit 'on my side' I used a proxy to get a comment to the top. This is eight years ago, so forgive my memory for being blurry, but I think it was something along the lines of:\n\n&gt; \"Wow, redditors are usually pro-science so it's shocking that they'd be so anti-scientific on this issue. None of the experts...\"\n\n...and so on. The point is that this was framed from the angle of a jaded insider criticizing a community out of disappointment for its lack of scientific literacy, and people care more about being scientifically literate here than they do about anything else, because to the average redditor being scientifically illiterate might as well be synonymous with low IQ anyway.\n\nI got the comment to something like +20 manually. Keep in mind, any time I posted this it was at -2, -5, or even -10. One person said I had a \"fucked up worldview.\" And so on.\n\nIt stayed at 20. Actually, it rose to 45. It never broke from the top position.\n\nI've seen feminists do similar things with their ideology. \"Wow, don't redditors like to think of themselves as educated? This is basic stuff. I'm shocked they'd be so ignorant.\" (It's a massive rhetorical advantage to call something 'basic', even if it's actually not basic, because the average person is going to treat knowledge as a sequential thing and infer that if someone doesn't know this basic thing then they must know nothing.)\n\nSo, this story brings up an important question: \n\nHow many people are uninfluenced by votes? In other words, how many people think for themselves?\n\nThere is no way to know for sure unless you have access to data a normal user does not, but I'd suspect it's something like 20-30%. That's low enough that fudging the initial votes of something will still dramatically influence it, because the rest will go along with whatever the dominant voting opinion is.\n\nSo, takeaways:\n\n- I won my bet with Ryan\n\n- Don't work in marketing unless it's a truly exceptional firm or you want to hate your life. If you do in fact want to hate your life, you could get a better return on your self-hatred by doing investment banking.\n\n- There are several kinds of vote manipulation you should be aware of: forced frontpaging, vote nudging, reverse-nudging and visibility manipulation.\n\n- The initial votecount (the first 5-10 votes) of submissions matters a lot\n\n- You might think that voting means organic content is going to rise to the top. This is probably true for subreddits that have &lt;50k subscribers. For very large subreddits (200k+) you could not be more wrong.\n\n- Comment manipulation happens everywhere, and probably happens even more often in controversial subreddits.\n\n- No matter how much you say \"don't downvote this way\", people always will\n\n- Most redditors are extremely influenced by votecounts and do not think for themselves.",

They have the *temerity* to ask a question, when they know full *fucking* well that Google exists.\n\nOr whatever. **They get downvoted.** So:\n\nThe problem is, while they may be getting downvotes from **people who do in fact disagree** with them (or at least agree with the other guy more (or are sheepling with the guy who already had more upvotes when they got there)), **the context reddit has insisted on** shoving down that new user's throat tells them that each and every one of those downvotes is saying, \"***BOO!*** Get that shit outta ma house! Your opinions are *nothing* to us! Begone from this place, and never darken this doorstep again!

But to the rest of us, the ones who are *not* necessarily salivating for the end of humanity as we know it: where does that leave *us*?\n\nIt seems like reddit needs to **at least acknowledge this dichotomy** between the two ways people use downvotes. They need to at least try to let newbies know that there's what we'd *like* and there's what *is*, and that they (noobs) should keep that in mind as they case the joint, as it were.",

Personally I just realized how popular /r/fatpeoplehate has become on this site, and it seems to me that Pao's remarks are in some way related to this kind of activity here. \n\nI've seen some meta-dustups on reddit before, but it looks like this could be a game-changer. If the admins do take on a greater role in moderating these kinds of extreme \"witch hunts\" or whatever you want to call them, could it be effective at radically altering the overall character of reddit? Or is reddit just \"too big to fail now\", and are efforts like this inevitably fruitless? \n\nI'm not trying to make any personal judgements about who's right or who's wrong. I'm just interested in how this will play out.\n\nIs the quality of reddit a real issue at all, at this point? If it is, as an alternative to censorship, are there more constructive actions the admins could take to improve the overall quality of reddit? \n\nOne issue I would argue for is modifying the voting system. This has always seemed like the greatest weakness of the site to me. For one thing, the voting algorithm promotes the [fluff principle.](http://www.paulgraham.com/hackernews.html) (The initial description of the fluff principle specific to reddit came from a comment on /r/circlebroke which is now inaccessible, and I also can't find the ToR submission that I'm pretty sure is what led me to the other comment. Some discussion of \"fluff\" [on r/TR](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/nhlku/the_fluff_principle_on_a_uservoted_news_site_the/) which was linked from [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/o69yb/lets_compile_an_faq_for_theoryofreddit_with_stuff/))\n\nI also feel like the voting system on reddit acts to discourage dissenting opinions, and therefore to promote circlejerks. Ideally the simplest ways to address this problem would be the best. Assuming that the ease of downvoting contributes most to this, what would be a good way of discouraging downvotes somewhat? Well, one good idea that I'm pretty sure has been proposed before but apparently never taken seriously by the admins is deducting downvotes from the voter's karma. This would limit the number of downvotes users are able to give, and it would discourage \"drive-by\" downvoting. Anyway, just a thought. Sorry if this is a tangent, but hopefully I'm managed to include something valuable in all these random thoughts. Thanks for reading. The reddiquette is dead! LONG LIVE THE REDDIQUETTE! \n\n*typo",

[Here is a complete history of it's score.](http://i.imgur.com/dzr1t16.png)\n\nAs you might already know, 1 upvote does not mean 1 point. Similarly, 1 downvote does not take away 1 point. \"Points\" are a calculation that includes at least two things along with upvotes. 1) The time the post was created, and 2) The typical number of upvotes for a community's size.\n\nThe reason for including time is so that reddit will show new content on a regular (e.g. daily) basis. A post's score is automatically reduced after a long enough time which can be seen when a post gets a lot of upvotes in a short amount of time, then rapidly loses points when it's a few hours older. \n\n**Edit:** After 4 more hours (6 total), the displayed score was adjusted to 5000 points and the \"future score\" is [expected to be about 4100](http://i.imgur.com/R6pOZek.png)\n\nThe reason for including the size of a community in the score is so that when you sort by \"top\" you will get relatively accurate results based on the fact that newer posts should always get more upvotes since the userbase is always increasing. This is harder to prove directly, but is generally assumed to be true if it hasn't already been confirmed.\n\nBased on these assumptions, and my past experience, I predict that by tomorrow, the AMA's score will be around 4500. Probably more (around 4650 maybe), because people will still be upvoting it as the day goes on.\n",

I thrive on reading :)_\n\n\n---\n\n\nA while ago, I acquired the /r/substarter subreddit, closed it down (it was basically a spam sub) and [published a general proposition](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubStarter/comments/31gn2j/announcement_a_vision_for_rsubstarter/) for my idea for it - a subreddit focused on starting up \"initial communities\" to go with new subreddits - meant to address both the problem of 'activation energy' required for new subreddits, and the problem of subreddits not being discussed before creation with regards to what the community should be like.\n\n\n\nI've partnered with a bot creator to help me develop a bot to make these \"kickstarter-like\" campaigns on reddit a reality, and in the meantime, have done plenty of navel-gazing with regards to the ideological decisions to be made for such a subreddit. \n\n\n\nI'm convinced there's a place for something like this. Just in searching this sub's latest posts for thoughts, I came across two posts asking about how to get past the initial 'tiny subreddit' issue and grow a community. \n\n\n\nAt the same time, it's time for me to assess others' thoughts on the idea, see what you guys have to say. \n\n\n\n(I'm thinking of opening up /r/substarter for some beta testing as well, soon. If you've tried creating new communites before but run into the \"dead town\" problem, trawl up those ideas again, and have them ready :) )",

        "text": "I have noticed a very disturbing trend on Reddit: the userbase wants to read lies because the truth is too boring and not lulz worthy. Recently I found a very blatant example of this, on a thread in askreddit thread which asked: \"What is the best way you've seen a guy hit on a girl?\"  A user [made up a story that got 3900+ karma, and admitted he made it up earning another 2900+ karma.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/344x8w/what_is_the_best_way_youve_seen_a_guy_hit_on_a/cqrcuo0?context=3) You cannot make shit like that up! Like most well adjusted people, I get mad or lose respect for people who lie for stupid reasons like to earn insignificant internet points. But based on the expression of the hivemind according to votes, most the userbase actually rewarded that liar, showing approval both for the initial lie and the later admission that he fooled them. It is like they don't care about the truth at all, infact you could say most Redditors want it murdered. This related thread askreddit thread explains what the userbase here wants:\n[Liars of askreddit, what is the lie you got the most karma for?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1my7p5/liars_of_askreddit_what_is_the_lie_you_got_the/)\n\nThe most revealing [response perhaps to be found there](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1my7p5/liars_of_askreddit_what_is_the_lie_you_got_the/#ccdredq) also netted considerable karma, this time 1060 points:  \n&gt;I pretend that askReddit is like a never ending short story collection. They may be all fiction, but the responses, the occasional glimmers of empathy, those are what's real. I come here to be entertained by story-tellers, not for real world events.  \n\nAskreddit appears to exist for people to solicit real life advice and experiences from their fellow posters, but as the hivemind illustrated above the real hidden purpose is purely for entertainment and lulz. \n\n[In a Ted Talk, Pamela Meyers describes](http://www.ted.com/talks/pamela_meyer_how_to_spot_a_liar/transcript?language=en) how commonplace lying is, especially among strangers:  \n&gt;On a given day, studies show that you may be lied to anywhere from 10 to 200 times. Now granted, many of those are white lies. But in another study, it showed that strangers lied three times within the first 10 minutes of meeting each other. (Laughter) Now when we first hear this data, we recoil. We can't believe how prevalent lying is. We're essentially against lying. But if you look more closely, the plot actually thickens. We lie more to strangers than we lie to coworkers. Extroverts lie more than introverts. Men lie eight times more about themselves than they do other people. Women lie more to protect other people. If you're an average married couple, you're going to lie to your spouse in one out of every 10 interactions. Now, you may think that's bad. If you're unmarried, that number drops to three.\n\nYou have to factor interacting with people on the internet is worse than with strangers in regards to the prevalence of lying, because of the anonymity factor of the internet. Even more so on Reddit since people learn quickly adapt to a hivemind that rewards lying with karma and punishes people trying to expose liars by downvoting them below viewing threshold. \n\nOne of the most blatant lies I came across in my Reddit browsing was when a military member [concocted this blatant lie](http://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/2uxdr2/after_befriending_family_and_their_neighbors_and/cocx1sf?context=3) earning 3541 karma in /r/news:  \n&gt; PETA were our biggest enemy in New Orleans after Katrina hit.  \n\nAfter confronting him he eventually edited that to mention a qualifier of his squad, but that was a minor backtracking from a lie. \n\n\nAnother very recent blatant lie I encountered again rewarded by the Reddit mob was this improbable tale on another default sub /r/funny:     \n&gt;... Miguel responds with a look on his face as if his puppy had just died or something with, \"I was with my mom and I just found out I'm Mexican.\" ... \"What, I always thought I was Brazilian.\" ...\n\n&gt;... Funny thing was everybody knew he was mexican, as everybody knew everybodies family in our little town.\n\nBut the only way that could be possible is if Miguel had a developmental disability that does not allow them to have full adult cognition, in other words if he could not function as a normal teenager easily playing soccer and communicating with others like he was in that tall tale. Or if their biological mom and dad wasn't in their life to tell him he was Mexican. Yet in that pathetically constructed lie everyone in town knew his Mexican family.\n\n[Pamela Meyer](http://www.ted.com/talks/pamela_meyer_how_to_spot_a_liar/transcript?language=en) on how lying requires two parties -- the liar and co-operative receiver of the lies:    \n&gt;... look, if at some point you got lied to, it's because you agreed to get lied to. Truth number one about lying: Lying is a cooperative act. ...\n\n&gt;...\n\n&gt;When you combine the science of recognizing deception with the art of looking, listening, you exempt yourself from collaborating in a lie. You start up that path of being just a little bit more explicit, because you signal to everyone around you, you say, \"Hey, my world, our world, it's going to be an honest one. My world is going to be one where truth is strengthened and falsehood is recognized and marginalized.\" And when you do that, the ground around you starts to shift just a little bit.\n\nI feel like Reddit is becoming some kind of asylum where you have to pay for your own walls and housing and have to enter remotely via an internet connection you also have to pay for, to experience the type of behavior that most the rest of the non-reddit internet and society frowns upon. When I confront Redditors about the negative aspects and behavior on this site, I always get **but this Reddit,** as if the normal decor expected on the rest of the net and real life should be abandoned. In the bizarro Reddit world, you receive massive positive karma, for your bad karma -- for your blatant lies. If you try confront liars, you will be massively brow-beated and down-voted badly, especially in large, default subs. As long as the karma system is intact, it will continue to give perverse incentive for this type of negative attention whoring. ",

        "text": "I submitted a post to /r/bestof yesterday highlighting a comment that someone made 6 years ago in regards to the reddit user base. The comment can be found [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/82uj2/for_all_of_reddits_antiestablishment_posturing/c0838bw?context=3), but here it is reproduced in full:\n\n&gt;I find it funny that so many here sit around on some high horse as if this place was a bastion of reason, intellect, and logical discourse when in reality it’s got huge hive-mind problems on many topics (anything negative about cops is a perfect example), a constant flow of down-modders ready to pounce on unpopular opinions (and the lemmings that follow suit), 10 minute reply limits on those who hold unpopular opinions (effectively regulating unpopular opinion to second-class status and forcing people to not put forward their true views), pun threads at the very top of serious stories, etc.\n\n&gt;Yeah, you guys are so great.\n\nFor context, the rest of the thread is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/82uj2/for_all_of_reddits_antiestablishment_posturing/).\n\nYou could take that comment, replace 'mod' with 'vote', put it in a thread on reddit and get many people to agree with you. Not that I necessarily agree with it - I'll get to that later - but many people take a dim view of the reddit hive mind.\n\nThe key point I'm trying to make is that I have heard from many people on this website - and on other websites in general - that the internet was much better 'X' Years in the past. Usually, many people point to the Digg migration as being the event that 'ruined' reddit, but this comment predates it, and obviously many people agreed with it.\n\nSo what does that say about the reddit user base? Has it always, well, sucked? I would like to point out a few other similarities/differences that I have noticed when browsing /r/reddit.com and the Wayback Machine:\n\n- The hive mind's tendency to panic has never really changed. Go to /r/panichistory, search for '/07' or '/08' and you will see articles highly up voted that claim that Bush would implement martial law, or even cancel the 2008 election.\n\n- I was surprised by how many infowars posts were up voted, but this mostly predated the subreddit system. But even so, I was shocked that these posts were even getting attention.\n\n- I thought that the Ron Paul stuff had been exaggerated. I was completely wrong.\n\n- Some memes have been replaced with others as time goes on. You never really see bacon references on reddit anymore, or references to 'how is babby formed'. Up vote parties were also a thing.\n\n- Often, the top comments in news articles were explaining how the article was completely wrong - a lot like today.\n\nSo to sum up; I believe that the hive mind of the user base of reddit has not really changed that much. There are many similarities between the content then and the content now, and the comments have not really changed in general as much as people think that they have. There may be more racism and sexism (although I do wonder how much that is down to the users of reddit rather than external influences, be it 4chan or Stormfront) but I can't really support the claims that the user base of reddit was much smarter then as it is now, as I have not seen much evidence of a change.\n\nI don't really think that the users of reddit are that bad either. I do wonder if people are maybe seeing change where there was none. Besides, you could probably go back through the history of the internet and see early reddit being described as 'terrible', and whatever came before that as 'terrible and ruining the internet'.\n\nOh, and in 2009, most of the defaults had just under 100,000 subscribers. /r/politics had 80,000 subscribers and I saw many people warning to stay away from it even then. In fact, many people warned other to stay away from /r/politics since its inception. Go figure.\n\nFor a final summation, see a humorous reply made to a post I made earlier [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDramaDrama/comments/362rsn/has_srd_gone_downhill_is_it_srss_fault_for_having/craouni).",
