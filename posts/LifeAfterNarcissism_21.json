        "text": "I feel so lost and confused. Do you remember that feeling when you felt so much self-hatred and blame within your Narc relationship? Do you remember when they would gaslight you and you believed them? And now afterwards, do you do what I do and constantly have to reality check everything, to be sure you don't \"sound crazy\"?\n\nA bit of background...I've been broken up with soon to be ex-narc abuser/husband for nearly 11 months, going through the divorce and child evaluation process. I have NEVER lost friends in my life but over this last year, three of them (mainly my friends but eventually grew to become his friend once we got together) have slowly crept away. I've recently confronted all three asking why they've been distant, and each of them either told me that my life was either \"too dramatic\" for them or they would say things like \"It sounds like it's been a hard year for BOTH of you\" and \"I care about BOTH of you\". This was AFTER I told them he strangled me (when I was pregnant) and had been abusive for quite some time. Granted, I never told these friends just how bad it was during our relationship...only afterwards. So, I can see why they would feel confused or shocked...but it feels like they don't believe me. Why on earth would a friend say to me that they \"care about us both\" and \"we've both had a stressful year\"...It feels like they are trying to put us in the same category. Meanwhile, in my mind, we're talking about a **criminal** (my ex, who recently was arrested on felony charges by my reporting btw) and a **victim/survivor**.\n\nAnyway, I just feel like they just don't \"get it\" and I feel like shit about it. I'm hurt, I'm angry, I'm shocked by three people, all of whom I thought were dear friends, have chosen to either put me and my ex in the same category or can't handle my \"dramatic\" life. This same feeling I'm experiencing feels like the same dismissal I felt throughout my relationship with my ex. I'm tired of it.\n\nAm I being irrational or jumping to conclusions here by feeling hurt/angry/dismissed/invalidated?\n\nThanks for letting me rant. And for the excessive use of quotes for emphasis. (Also, I posted this on another subreddit. Please let me know if I'm not allowed to do this).",

So it seems like the best course of action is to empower the \"victim\"my mother in this situation to stand on her own 2 feet and coach her how not to be a victim anymore.\n\nBut I am confused about some of the concepts in TED though. The Empowerment Dynamic talks about how the \"persecutor\" needs to become the \"challenger\". ok, but how is this achieved ? Is this something I have to tell my bully brother to grow into? That doesn't make sense. If that's not the right course of action then am I to expect him to make this change on his own? I am extremely confused. I understand my new role - to become a coach and my mother's - to become a creator. But who in their right mind can talk to a persecutor to change because some book on Amazon said so. Hope that made sense. I am not sure how the \"persecutor\" will become the \"challenger\". \n\nIt seems like the rescuer talks to the victim and the persecutor is left on his own in this new dynamic since he is after all the bully and should be kept at a distance. Do I have the right understanding in regards to this ? Just wanted to make sure.",

I know if I try bringing it up again, I'll be told to \"suck it up\" and just enjoy myself.\n\nI got DW a few gifts, most of which she has specifically hinted towards: an inexpensive ring with our names engraved on it, a nice foot soaking/massage tub, a large dutch oven, and I had a coworker make a pencil and charcoal portrait of her cocker spaniel and had it nicely framed (the house is littered with pics of him too).  As for me, I'm honestly fine with not receiving any presents; while the gestures are appreciated, I don't really have desire to ask for anything specific, nor would I be heartbroken or angry if I didn't get anything.  I can't tell them that though, or they'd get mad at me, maybe even call me ungrateful.\n\nIn-laws bought me a winter coat as a gift.  It is very nice, I appreciate it a lot.

When giving it to me, they apparently saw that I \"needed\" one because I always wore lighter coats.

Today, I sent the same message to my mom after receiving yet another guilt trip about coming over to visit for Christmas.  \n\nIt honestly doesn't feel great. It's like I know intellectually that they are abusive people and that it's detrimental to my own healing to be around them, but I still have a deep rooted sense of responsibility for their wellbeing. It's fucking tragic how poorly they take care of themselves, and how much pain they are in. But I know it's not my responsibility to take care of those problems, even if it feels like it is. \n\nFor the first time ever, I'm off my medication. I'm seeing a therapist who understands what happens to individuals who are abused by parents during childhood. I'm going to college, which I never thought I would be able to manage, and I'm actually pretty good at it. I'm living with a man who supports me and makes me feel good about myself. \n\nGoing NC is the natural next step, and while it didn't feel great, I do feel like some weight has been lifted off of my shoulders. I feel like I'm free to breathe and work on my issues at my own pace and without fear, knowing that my parents are at a distance now and they can't hurt me anymore. It's so hard, but I'm trying to tell myself it gets easier. It does get easier, right?\n\nAnyway, I hope others out there are practicing plenty of self-care during the holiday season. This time of year is particularly hard for me. Thanks so much for reading. I just wanted to get this off my chest. \n\n\n\n",

        "text": "NC with my Ndad for several years now, enough that the furor has died down in the family and mostly they take it for granted that events are largely me or him. (Encouraging for those in earlier stages: it can be done! I'm still alive!) I'm mostly in a place where I just don't think about him and over holidays I focus on the people I do spend time with and enjoy and that's enough. \n\nI guess I'd been rolling along pretty confidently until my birthday, which was a milestone one recently, and my Ndad texted asking if I wanted to have lunch. I mean, I know the answer to that and so should he if he's been following along, and I grey rocked him with \"can't sorry\" without too much trouble....but then I guess it got to me afterward and I've been revisiting all the old stuff. \"Does he not realize...I should say...I'll tell him if he x then y...\" This is the age-old song and the reason I'm NC: it's too tempting to think he might change and long experience shows he.will.not. And I just can't stand the hoping and gyrating and planning and analysis involved in trying to get my feelings across to him and the requirements I'd have for a new relationship. And it takes so little too trigger all this hope, idk whether because you just never give up wanting parents or the allure of FINALLY airing your frustrations...but I'm annoyed to be thrust back into this headspace where I'm unsure about things again and hopeful and disappointed and just stirred up. I wish I didn't have his trigger.\n\nA few days later I spoke to Egrandma (his mom). My son has a holiday performance coming up (and is not exactly enforced NC himself but as a result of the situation basically NC too. I wouldn't *forbid* them speaking but if it went much beyond occasional I would step in. Which, as a teenager he probably gets and seems fine with.). Egran says \"I mentioned the performance to your dad and he's interested in coming, would that be ok? It's up to you.\"  I grey rocked her too and just said, \"you asked me this last year too and nothing has changed. So no.\" She moved off the subject and I'm not afraid they'll come anyway since everyone knows by now that I will cut even gran off if that happens.\n\nSo I don't feel threatened, I feel...sad. Guilty? Mean. It suuuucks because I feel like I'm still playing in the narcissists' game. That whenever you don't give them what they want you're unreasonable, vindictive, uncaring, destroying the family, heartless, etc etc. And because I AM a reasonable person, that all makes me think of ways that I *could* compromise- if he sat in the back, if I didn't have to talk to him...logistical compromises leads to the bigger emotional issues: if he agrees to xyz, if I tell him that, if I make it clear, if he stops (whatever)....and ultimately I have to circle back around to, do I want to get back on this merry-go-round? Do I believe there is some cheese at the end of this tunnel? Or am I, just reflexively, just trying to give someone else what they want while it runs contrary to what I want?\n\n I'm fine without him. I've accepted things are impassable, my life is good without him in it, better than with him. I've learned a lot about pursuing what I want, and that that can include the people I want and don't want *as well as* HEARING about who I want and don't want. Which, weirdly was its own struggle, for a long time I thought, \"ok I might have a right to go NC, but I don't have a right to insist everyone stop talking to me about him; they're just expressing their feelings!\" Eventually I realized how ridiculous that is- if my happiness is important, then it doesn't matter whether a cookie, a person, a person's absence, or a conversation will make me happy, it makes sense to pursue the good ones and avoid the bad ones. I guess I got pretty complacent having things the way I want them and didn't expect to have \"feelings\" again about this holiday season. \n\nI guess it boils down to what I told her- nothing has changed just because she brought it up or he wished me happy birthday. My choice to revisit all this stuff, allow myself to doubt and feel guilty and conflicted is just my choice- there's no actual need. And probably, I'm mad at my gran, who should know by now that this is a painful topic for me, but chooses to put herself first and bring it up anyway. It sucks bc I feel for her, I understand that she has pain because our family can't be the way she wants it to be, and I don't want to be the one withholding her happiness. But unfortunately I just can't give her what she wants. So I guess I'm mad and sad and guilty all over again like I said, and there's no way out so I'd rather not be reminded of it all. You know? \n\nI know this is pretty philosophical navel-gazing. But that's the level it bothers me on. Would love any reassurance or analysis or just \"me too\" if you've gotten this far. Thanks so much for being here, LAN. It's so invaluable to know people will understand!",

Before I had blocked him, he would call me off blocked numbers, send me texts via fake numbers and the Anonymous Messages Sarahah app and would send waves of endless Facebook messages and calls until my phone would freeze. And then when I DID block him, I still had to deal with him contacting my family until most of them were forced to so the same. \n\nHas anyone elsw gone through something similar? Any tips or advice? My dad thinks I should get a restraining order against him, but he's thousands of miles away and I'm not even sure where exactly. I also highly doubt he'd heed it or if it would even help, since he is still contacting my family to get to me instwad of through me directly.\n\nUgh. So frustrating. I just want to be left alone. It has been almost a year since the breakup and I'm still being tortured....... ",

        "text": "Hey guys, \nI’ve been thinking about this for a while now and I’d like to hear your opinion and/or advice. \n\nI’ve gone NC with N parents. My dad didn’t accept this at first and harassed me at my house (I never told him where I live). Among a lot of other things, he said it might be better for my grandma if I didn’t tell her that I cut off contact with them. She’s 84, and he said she probably wouldn’t understand and it would just upset her. It would be better if I just told excuses why I wasn’t on her birthday or at Christmas, I wasn’t around that much anymore any way (I’ve moved abroad). \n\nFair enough, she is old and she probably won’t get it. My grandma is a good woman but previous responses to all sorts of things have made it clear that she is limited in her ability to understand or feel empathy (not in a mean way, she just doesn’t seem to understand). I know my dad said these things to get himself of the hook, and so that I seem like the bad guy for never coming around anymore. It would make it so easy for them to blame everything on me and I’d have to have the painful talks where I tell her why suddenly I’m never there for her birthdays etc anymore (eventhough I’ve never missed one). So I know he’s just saying it for himself, and I don’t want to give them that easy way out. \n\nThe other side is that if I do tell her, she probably won’t understand. Every personal thing I tell her, or send her in a card (she’s hard hearing, so talking on the phone takes a lot of effort) she will tell them. I don’t want them to know anything about me anymore. She will most likely tell me every time we talk that it’s so painful and why I can’t just make up. She loves me, but I don’t think she will let that go. \nAside from that I’m worried how my parents will react when I do tell her what’s going on. I won’t do what they say (narc basics) and they’ve already come by and harassed me. I’m sure they’ll do it again, eventhough I told them that I have taken measures to make sure they aren’t let close to me. It has given me nightmares because I don’t feel like I can judge how far they’ll go, and that telling my nan might prove to be a trigger. \n\nI sometimes feel like the pain of having to go through telling her, being confronted with the consequences, and perhaps having to tell her that I can’t talk to her anymore because I can’t get closure, is too much. Maybe I should just tell her that I’m cutting everyone off, including her and that it’s not her fault. My grandma would be the only person I’d talk to anyway. I wonder if still talking to my nan and saving her grief outweighs the lack of closure and constantly having to be careful about the info I give her. I love her and giving her up would hurt, but the other option seems stressful and probable to end painfully too... ",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterNarcissism/comments/7ihtp7/possible_tw_experience_with_narcissistic_ex/",
        "text": "Hi everyone,  I am particularly nervous about posting, mainly due to the fact that I feel like a terrible person when I talk about my past with my ex since I didn't come to terms with him being a narcissist until after the relationship ended. A large part of me feels like I'm making it up to validate my own hurts (even though the other part of me knows that's not true), especially since he denies any *real* abuse within the relationship--but then again, do abusers ever truly admit their abuse? Anyway, I do tend to talk about it to others, but not in detail due to the fear I'll be told I was the terrible spouse he told me I was or that I deaerved it (I do, however, admit that I made my mistakes in the relationship too, which I take full responsibility for). So, here goes:\n\nA tiny bit of back story: I grew up in an emotionally and physically abusive home and my mother was not a good caretaker due to various factors I won't get into. I am used to abuse. Perhaps this is why I was so blind to it with my ex and why I took it for as long as I did.\n\nI first got with my ex when I was only 15, he being 17; he was my first serious relationship so his presence is basically all I really know (and I guess not having any other [prior] healthier relationships to reflect on has made it extremely difficult to cope). From the start, the relationship never had it's relaxing moments--fights were common within the first few weeks we got together. And, me being the naive and inexperienced teenager I was, didn't see the obvious red flags. Here are a few things that lead to arguments:\n\n• My friends were a huge issue for him. If he saw me walking with a guy friend after class, he would show visible signs of being uncomfortable. I took note of this, and made an effort to show him that I was 100% committed to him by spending more time with him and talking about him with my guy friends. After he progressively became more possessive and angry, I stopped hanging out with said friends entirely, females included (they were probably \"gay for me,\" after all, as he said). This lead to me basically shutting down around anyone we hung out with even together as a couple because I was afraid he'd get upset with me. One time in particular, our mutual friend came by while he was at work and we'd decided to watch a movie on my phone. When my ex (obviously then boyfriend at the time) came home, the friend was sitting exrremely close to me to see the movie and my ex lost his shit on the both of us. He was angey with both of us for a few days, even though nothing ever happened. \n\n• Never being \"happy\" for him. After about 8 months into the relationship, I had moved and I only saw him on the weekends.  He got a job and specifically requested to work through the weekend. I showed that this upset me and tried explaining why, to which he told me I was unappreciative and ungrateful, rather than assuring me that he'd make time for the relationahip (which he didn't). After a brief breakup, I made an effort to see him on school nights. I was still deemed as ungrateful and a brat during our arguments. \n\n• I never did enough. He graduated high school before me, so my time was consumed with classes, after school activities I refused to give up, homework and my remaining time was spent with him. I often stayed with him on school nights after he moved out of his parents' house; I made a conscious effort to clean my own messes and do what I could to help since he worked long hours 6 days a week. But I never cleaned enough, cooked enough or gave him enough attention even though I was exhausted too despite making a conscious effort to makw him feel valued and appreciated by me. \n\n• I never wanted to be intimate with him enough. He was my first everything, so it took me awhile to realize what I liked and wanted out of sex, and when I did, I found he was completely unwilling to do basically anything I wanted unless he liked it too. After awhile, I stopped asking for things and eventually my sex drive hit rock bottom; when we did finally do the deed,  it was after being pressured into doing so and it always felt like a chore. I would avoid it often (especially since I tended to dissociate during). He never cared about the WHY, refused to acknowledge my struggles with sex and would be openly angry if I showed disinterest in the act.\n\n• I was attracted to other people--which wasn't true. I was madly in love with him and desperate for his attention, to which I tried avoiding all interactions with the opposite sex when I could. However, I do admit to getting emotionally involved with someone else after he was extremely cold and unwilling to give me the affection anyone, let alone a teen with an abusive childhood, needs. My actions were in no way justified, but once this happened, he refused to break things off with me but also refused to talk it out (which, generally, is what led to the emotional cheating to begin with. Again though, I am not justifying my actions).\n\n•His drinking. He was in fact an alcoholic and he would always get upset when I vocalized my concerns or refused to partake in it with him. He would always say, \"work is crazy and we fight a lot, so it makes it easier to deal with so I don't yell at you for whatever I did this time.\" Despite this, he would often be livid with me and I never knew what I did and he was always unwilling to explain.\n\nNow, some things that quickly became a pattern in these fights:\n\n• It was always my fault. I was always the crazy one with wild emotions and had no reason to be upset over the things he did.\n\n• He would become extremely cold towards me and shut me out,  ignoring all of my efforts to communicate until I gave up; then it would turn into him being desperate and getting upset with ME, now that I had decided I was too exhausted to continue fighting with him on the issue and being given the cold shoulder. I am now the cold and unfair one.\n\n• After much miscommunication and me being confused as to what else to do, if he did not give me the space I asked for and then demanded, I would become the crazy teen I was and throw a few things (not okay, I know, but I did adress this issue of mine later on). This led him to pinning me down and shouting in my face (often these were insults and about how ungrateful I was, etc.),  which eventually progressed to physically shoving/tossing me; later on came threats of actually hitting me, raising his fists to me and putting his hands around my neck, and, on rare occasions, actually leaving bruises (and though I know this doesn't justify his bebaviour, he never *actually* hit me). He would always apologize afterwards with promises of change that would never come. He said I just made him crazy and he couldn't help it.\n\nAfter about a year into the relationship, he said he wanted to marry me when I was still in high school. Me being the person I am and never wanting to get married, I skeptically agreed after his incessant badgering on the matter. I told no one until I moved out of state, to which he breaks up with me out of the blue because \"I was too crazy.\" Eventually we got back together and he treats me extremely well and I moved back home a few months later. Again, he abruptly breaks up with me, allegedly for the same reason, and he admitted to cheating on me (funny thing, he changed it from \"I just kissed her for a dare,\" to \"I willingly made out with her,\" and then to \"I just kissed her on the cheek.\"). After begging and pleading only for him to use me for sex and then treating me as if I meant nothing to him afterwards, I eventually gave up and entered a rebound relationship. I also began seeing a therapist regularly for my anxiety and depression. After a couple months, he forced himself back into my life and begged for me to take me back and when he finally convinced me to break things off with the other person, he then reverted back to being cold and distant and only took me back when he was positive, I'm sure, that he had the power to decide it was his choice to *hesitantly* take me back. Afterwards, he was the perfect partner--he gave me all the love and affection I wanted, and treated me like a queen. I had told him I did not want to marry him, at least not for awhile, to which he agreed and we broke off the engagement. Fast forward  a few more months, fights returned, but since I was convinced I was the crazy, erratic one, I stopped breaking things and throwing fits and even stopped pushing him to his limits (though now I now know his bwhavior was not my fault, as he always reverted back and he had changed very little despite my efforts to deescalate arguments by offering us both space followed by clear communication). I also stopped seeing my therapist and my anxiety and depression returned. He started pressuring me into marriage again by saying if we love each other then there should be no reason not to, so I marries him. Afterwards, fights began to escalate again and he startes drinking more, despite my efforts to communicate more and keep the house clean because he refused to let me have a job. My family and friends tell me it was a bad idea, I shut down their concerns and stop talking to most of them on a regular basis. On holidays when we'd visit my family, they all adored him and my mother even said that I was too hard on him. My step mother told him he deserved better than me, whereas my dad couldn't stand his presence for the most part, so there was wuite a bit of conflict from all angles. I spend the next two years feeling invalidated and underappreciated, but keeping it to myself because maybe he was right and I was being ungrateful for all he does for me, even though he chose to work on and not acknowledge both the anniversaries of when we got together and our marriage, as well as my birthdays(which were spent alone, where he had gotten me nothing each year). When someone angers him, he tells me he vividly imagines killing them in the most detailed,  gruesome ways. I shake it off and convince myself he is just saying it out of anger, but wonder if he thinks about me that way when he's mad at me.\n\nFast forward a few more months, we have moved in with my sister and her boyfriend. We get into a disagreement while out doing errends, we both say hurtful things. I tell him I need space to cool down and he leaves me there, as requested. When I return home, all of his things are gone and he refuses to reply to my texts or call back for an entire week--the same exact thing he pulled the two previous times we broke up. When he finally contacts me after all my desperate attempts, he says I am always mad and he never undeestands why, and he is unhappy but wants to be happy with me. I tell him I am sorry and that I'll do anything he wants me to do. This goes on for two months before, once again, he only skeptically takes me back once he's sure it was all his idea to do so. He is back to being the very definition lf the perfect partner, all the while I have promised myself and vocalized to him that if he pulls the same shit one more time, we are through. Over the next few months, I feel extremely distant and unsure about our relationship. Fights are kept at a minimum as I hold my tongue and give him what he wants. His possessiveness returns and I again shut all of my friends out. I have nightmares almost every night for the next two years that he is extremely angry with me and is leaving me.\n\nFast forward to a year; I have had a full-blown mental breakdown from my anxiety and depression and I returt to therapy where I start taking medication--which he is 100% unsupportive of. My time is all but used up with college, therapy, trying to be a good wife and not causing him any stress. Through all my efforts to better myself, he is still drinking and becoming more physically violent with me for reasons I didn't understand. The breaking point comes around the end of December last year when I am irritable from lack of sleep and probably inadequate food intake, and I snap at him. He then drinks a heavy amount and follows me around the house calling me every insult and degrading name in the book, telling me I am a terrible wife and overall human being who can't do anything right. I lock myself in my room because I am more afraid than I have ever been that he would physically hurt me. And that was the very last time I ever saw him in person. \n\nAbout two weeks later with little to no contact, he finally tells me that he wants a divorce after my begging and pleading to work things out. After a few more days of the same thing, I remember my promise to myself and I tell him I respect his choice but fall into a very deep depression nonetheless. I find out from mutual friends that he openly admitted to cheating on me numerous times (which actually makes sense, as we would sometimes see girls at the store that he would avoid at all costs saying \"she had a crush on me,\" but I merely shook it off and took his word for it); I confront him and he denies all of it,  then gaslights me by saying \"well I was always convinced you were cheating on me,\" even though I had no friends and rarely left the house without him in toe. At this point, I'm finally seeing the years of abuse.\n\nMy 21st birthday rolls around about three weeks later without hearing much from him other than a \"you deserve better than me\" and a happy birthday. I actually really enjoy my birthday for the first time in years and I even reconnected with a friend I've known since before I got with my ex, and we develop romantic feelings for one another over the next few month. My ex somehow finds out, calls me incessantly until I answer and insinuates that he wants me back, to which I shut him down. He then makes me promise that we will stay friends and not to EVER block him because \"I am still important to him.\" During this time, he keeps saying he wants us to hang out and talk so there's no hard feelings,  blah blah blah. I then find out that after a week of his disappearance before he even says he wanted a divorce that he had left the state and gotten a new girlfriend. I stop contacting him after this and kept our communication short when he contacted me. He then sabotages the potential relationship I had with my friend, calls me from blocked numbers and on facebook and continuously messeged me until I had to block all unknown/blocked numbers and him on facebook. He then starts harassing my family to get me to comtact him, who then had to block him as well.\n\nIt's been about a year since we broke up, and about 6 months with absolutely no contact. I have since moved but I still fear him showing up at my doorstep. I see cars the same color and model as his and I get panic attacks even though I know he's thousands of miles away. I still have reoccurring nightmares about us getting back together and having this dreadful feeling or of him leaving me all over again. I cannot communicate for the life of me to my new boyfriend, and I go from hot to cold 24/7; like, one minute I feel so fucking in love with him and then I think \"I really shouldn't be with him,\" for no apparent reason. I am significantly more happy with him than I ever was with my ex. Hell, we haven't even had an argument yet, he rarely irritates and I genuinely smile and laugh with him. Yet I cannot open up emotionally, vocalize my needs and wants and I am constantly terrified he is going to realize I am a shit person the way my ex did and leave me. I thought I would die alone. I thought I would never find anyone better than him, and yet here I am with someone significantly better, here I am with someone I probably don't deserve.\n\nBut everything seems to remind me of my ex. I am over him. In fact, I think I fell out of love with him months before we broke up for good; I even broke the pattern of rebound relationships and only got with someone I genuinely connected with when I felt I was ready to start a new relationship. But I STILL cannot get him out of my head and I hate that, especially because they are all associated with terrible experiences and feelings, none of which are nostalgic in the slightest. I still get nightmares and this anxious feeling like a rock in my stomach. I felt racked with guilt--and still do--for thinking of his as abusive and narcissistic. A part of me feels like I'm justifying my own actions by blaming him for abuse. I mean, I KNOW it was abuse... But it feels like it sounds much worse than it actually was when I explain it to others or even myself, if that makes sense. I guess maybe a part of me is still in denial.\n\nHonestly, I just want to be able to heal and fully move on from my past and have a healthy, functional relationship with my current boyfriend. I have been able to heal from my past abuse and forgive my abusers, fully capable of moving on with my life and giving them and those memories little thought. But I cannot seem to do the same with my ex.\n\nAnyway, if you took the time to read through all of my venting and rambling... Thank you, I appreciate it. I just felt like maybe talking about it with others that understand would be a good start since I no longer have access to a therapist until further notice. I'm not even sure if he is a narcissist or a full-blown sociopath or both. Sigh. Again, thanks for taking the time to reach such a lengthy post you guys! Keep on keeping on and all that jazz.",

        "text": "So, I dated my ex for about four years. We had what I'd mostly consider a good relationship, and mutually broke up. We were friends for about two years after that. We recently decided to mutually end our friendship, deciding it was toxic. I'm coming to terms with stuff that has me all fucked up.\n\nSo, a continual dynamic in our relationship was that I was insensitive, and despite having good intentions, would frequently accidentally hurt my ex. This continued into our friendship. When we'd discuss these things, it never felt like my perspective mattered. Frequently around things that would be deemed my deeply hurting him, I would have tried to have checked in with him before. Some examples:\n\n- We were non-monogamous for part of our relationship, one time, I slept with another person after having not wanted to sleep with him on the same day due to feeling weird about that. He had also been acting very clingy and I was turned off. He felt rejected. I ask him if he is okay with me still going out with this person/hooking up with him that day. He, despite seeming distressed, tells me \"I'm not going to tell you what to do.\" or something like that, and also sends me a text later that day telling me he hopes I have a good time. I take him at his word and I do I sleep with my friend. It becomes the lowest point of our relationship and something we never recover from even though I ASKED HIM IF HE WANTED ME TO NOT DO IT and he could have just asked me to not. My perspective on the events never seems to matter. We never fully move past it. He feels weird about the person for years. Says it was traumatic.\n\n- He lived with his mom and was unwilling to get a retail job, but would complain to me about not being able to find work. When I, who was working retail at the time, suggested that he was privileged by not having to, it was a problem.\n\n- Had cripplingly low self-esteem and would often be confident \"at\" me. I tried to be supportive.\n\n- Was bothered that I didn't Like more of his Instagram posts when it wasn't really how I used the tool. Like it came up multiple times. He brought this up recently to a friend. Years later.\n\n- There would be lots of instances of me accidentally saying something he found hurtful and then it becoming a huge thing. I concluded that I had major issues with insensitivity and tried harder.\n\n- Me mentioning *facts about his life* to other people, things that were *fully in his control* was a problem. Such as the idea that his mom did his laundry.\n\nI think the context of our dynamic post-breakup makes this a lot clearer:\n\nWe break-up. It's mutual. And kind. I'm still super in love with him so I ask him to promise to stay best friends with me (I was a stupid 26 year old, I'll own it) He gets super weird post-breakup and is frankly a giant jerk for months after. Something even he acknowledged. I try very hard to be supportive, he pushes me away and complains a lot. Ton of drama. By the time he starts feeling better, I'm burnt out. We enter into years of drama. \n\n- One time we stupidly sleep together post-breakup. He tells me how feeling the loss of our relationship was like having a phantom limb. I, because I'm a shitty 12 year old go \"Haha, a phantom *dick*\" What I thought was a stupid pun was apparently a castration joke and something he is traumatized by.\n\n- One time I come over to his apartment when I have a cold (because me canceling on plans was a huge issue so I was determined to keep to the plans so he couldn't get mad if I canceled, I refuse to cancel even when he offers me an out) but when I get there I'm in a bad mood. We smoke. I get sleepy and high and complain about him and his mom to him. He gets super weird (valid, I was being a dick) and the experience is apparently so upsetting he no longer feels comfortable with having me in his space.\n\n- I at some point develop resentment issues that I acknowledge are not healthy and try to work on. This is a huge problem for him. I think they stem from how I had to always be accepting of stuff even when I thought it was stupid/frustration from our dynamic.\n\n- He decides me having them is terrible for his mental health and chooses to end our friendship. On my end, I'm just tired of the drama and hurting him.\n\n- I return some tshirts of his that I have and a poem he wrote me at the end of our romantic relationship. He says returning the poem is the \"single most hurtful and offensive thing anyone has ever done to him\" before seeing the small note I'd left but even after still say I threw him away, ignores any context I provide (he's a talented poet and I thought he deserved to decide what happened to his art, keeping it felt weird to me) or apologies I make. Says he meant nothing to me. That I threw him away. That's our last communication.\n\nA friend of ours, who grew up with a narcissist, is interacting with him and begins to think he sees signs of it. Digs further. Becomes convinced. It's a super weird revelation for both of us. I realize that maybe I'm not some low-empathy asshole, something that has never come up in any other dynamic I've had with folks as an adult.\n\nI find this: http://www.9types.com/movieboard/messages/13679.html It reads like a description of him.\n\nMy perception of myself for YEARS is thrown into question. I now have to begin the work of figuring out where I was actually wrong (because I'm not denying for a second that I made hella gaffes) and where things were blown out of proportion and my intent was never important. He's also done some gross stuff in terms of interacting with my friend and asking the friend to say stuff to me and saying all this stuff about me that seems unbelievably harsh in the context of my actions. \n\nI'm going to stay away from him. Bleh.\n\n\n",

        "text": "My mother is a covert narc. She is highly manipulative, frequently lies, and is fundementally selfish. But she  is obsessed with the idea of being a good mother and has a masters degree in counseling. That means she knows all the things she is SUPPOSE to say and do. But it's all a facade. Everything has strings. \n\nI'm 24 and have had some health issues , I dropped out of college and had to move back home several years ago. So I was/am dependent on this toxic and manipulative person for several years (again). I'm currently in therapy and finally able to work a job again. In about a month I'm going back to college and will live on campus away from her insanity. \n\nHowever. This is where things get really tricky. I'm pretty religious. OK I'm REALLY religious. I spent the past 7 years trying to figure out what I believe and why, and trying to find a church I felt I felt had integrity and was trustworthy. I spent 7 years searching, reading, researching, and at the same time also focusing on self improvement. I finally came across the eastern orthodox church. I wasn't interested in first but long story short eventually I came to believe that given the evidence that they are the fullest most correct form of christianity. \n\nThe closest parish was about an hour from my home, I couldn't drive at the time so my dad drove me. What I found was a church where people where honest and sincere. Far from perfect but I finally after all these years found what I was looking for. My family had said I had been looking in vein, that no church was perfect, and at times tried to pursude me to just find any church, but I wouldn't I kept looking for something with substance. \n\nAt first my nmom was against it. She was Baptist after all and we pray to saints in the orthodox church. But when she realized she couldn't stop me from pursuing it she started reading into it and eventually attended and at this point is fully intending to join the church. \n\nHowever she is self righteous about it, always indignat about something. She has done what she always does, she gets in the middle of anything important to me in such a way where she controls it. Because it's an hour away and we live together we (and sometimes my father) go in one car. She just decides \"we are going early/staying late/whatever\" with no consideration to anyone else. Then the whole way there and back she put on this persona which is complete bullshit. When she talks to people she makes me out to be some sort of cripple and plays the martyr and out how much she does for me. I wish she had been AGAINST  me joining the church because her approval is even more toxic than her dissaproval. \n\nI'm angry the entire time I'm there. It's one thing to use me to to feed her ego, it's one thing to use the church to feed her ego, it's one thing to do \"good deeds\" to feed her ego (at least then SOMEONE is benefiting). But I draw the line at her using my very personal very important very PRIVATE practice of my faith to feed her ego. \n\nWe are suppose to be accepted as catachumens soon and I absolutely do not want to come into the church with her, I'm not sure if I'm capable of doing that without puking. She disgust me on a fundementally level. She constantly tries to decide what it would be \"good\" for me to go to at church. It's not her fucking place to try and control my life. \n\n she has gone and taken the most valuable thing i found in the entirety of my life from me. I can't focus on prayers because she is constantly watching me waiting till I do something for her to critique. Or she is looking at me with that stupid arrogant smile that says \"tell me how amazing I am, tell me how I'm better than everyone else\". Her entire persona when she is there is a fiction, there isn't a single genuine thing about her. \n\n7 fucking years. And she comes in and ruins the most valuable and Constructive place in my life. And she infest it with her selfishness, her narsassism, and her controlling bullshit to the point where I hate going, because it's no long a safe place, it's no longer a place for growth, it's a place for her to USE everyone and everything to feed her fucking ego",

        "text": "I'm the youngest of five, with a 14 year gap between me and my oldest sibling. I constantly wonder and have even asked my mom before: why did you keep having kids if you knew it was bad? I suppose I've answered my own question, because my mom said she wanted to have her own family. I just don't think it's fair. My NDad has been the same way his whole life, so how could my mom see that and think \"I'll just keep popping them out, and things will be fine\"? I think it's selfish, and I can only hope with this new knowledge of narcissists that I will never enter a relationship with one. \n\nMy mom came here (the US) with nothing. She met my father and became financially dependent on him for the rest of her life, including present time. They've been divorced for most of my life, but they still live together and she still lives in his shithole house living by his bullshit rules. She's tried to remove me from the situation many times when I was younger, but as a result I was alienated from my four siblings and didn't get as much time to bond with them as they did with each other. Like many others, I don't remember my childhood but my brother always says it's not fair that I didn't get much time with them. She also always ended up back in the house. My brothers, older now, have spent so much money on her- paying her rent for an apartment, buying her brand new furniture to decorate the apartment, anything to make her comfortable, and she always goes back. She doesn't love him. Her mom was a N so I guess it's what she's comfortable with. I'm the only girl in my family, never knew my grandparents (probably for the best, a grandparent on each side was a N) and my only female role model has been my mother who stays with this abusive POS and made us suffer the consequences all our lives. I think I would have been happier if I grew up poor (without my father's financial support) with just my siblings and my mom in my life. Why did she have to keep going back to him? Did she really think it was the best life for us? I've spent almost all of my life resenting my mother for putting us through this, now she's getting older and I feel insanely guilty for recognizing any of her faults. I'm so jealous of other girls with strong relationships with their mothers, because every time I get close to my mom it hurts too much and I have to be distant again. When I was 9 years old there was an incidence where my mother flew me across the country to hide from my father, but I didn't see him as a bad figure yet so I found our host's address on an envelope and emailed my dad to come get me. To this day my mom brings it up and blames me for the reason \"we didn't get out.\" I was also supposed to move out with my mom and two of my brothers about four or five years ago and ended up not going with (I would have been taken out of the school district I was in my whole life) and my family ended up having to move back into the house. My mom still blames me for the entire thing. My whole life I grew up thinking there was a good parent and a bad parent and that she was the good one. It's so hard to think about the grand scheme of things when I subconsciously put people in boxes.\n\nI feel very guilty for recognizing my NDad's faults as well. He can be so fucking nice to me sometimes that the other side of him seems like an illusion. Just the other day he texted me to check up on me and I said \"appreciate it\" and he said \"I’m your daddy you don’t have to. To me your PRICELESS\" He brags about how smart and successful I am in my career thus far and even tells me he's proud of me, but none of it feels real. When I'm far away, he is so nice to me. Then I come home, after weeks of him saying how much he misses me and wishes I was home, and he ignores me the entire time! What's real and what's not? Does the bad outweigh the good and make the nice things false, all lies? I think one day after I'm no longer financially dependent on him (college) I'll have to go LC-NC but it will kill me, thinking about his nice act. He's getting older like my mom, and thinking about his eventual death makes me extremely emotional, thinking one day I will regret avoiding contact with him and speaking out against him in times where he was bad to us. \n\nDoes anyone else get these guilt trips? How do you overcome them?",

        "text": "A little bit of background:\n\nI’ve been NC with my family for a little over 2 years. I live only about 15 minutes away from Nmom, so my biggest fear was running into her randomly when I would be caught off guard and not expecting it. This is the main topic of almost every nightmare I’ve had since then. \n\nThe reason I was so afraid of it was because I didn’t know how I’d react. Logically I know that being NC is the best thing for me and is what I want, but i worried that if actually face to face with her, I would feel wistful or sympathetic. \n\nI tend to freeze when I panic, so I was worried I wouldn’t be able to react rationally and she would guilt me back into contact.\n\nFor the first year of NC I didn’t leave the house much at all and rarely went anywhere I thought she also might go.\n\nLast week my daughter and I decided to do some shopping in a nearby town, we hadn’t been there since going NC and it’s a place we commonly went with Nmom so we kind of thought of it as “her” territory. \n\nAt first my guard was up, but eventually I relaxed and was really enjoying myself, so when it finally happened I was about as off guard as I could have possibly been. \n\nI was coming around the corner of an aisle to go down a different aisle and there was Nmom right in front of me, like 3-4 feet away. \n\nI don’t really even remember the exact moment I saw her, but I literally stopped dead in my tracks and jumped back, I sort of flew up in the air a little when I jumped. \n\nPicture a horse running full speed and then rearing back when it suddenly reaches the edge of a cliff. Or the way a basketball player’s shoes screech when they stop and change direction suddenly.\n\nShe didn’t look up or notice - which I find interesting. Because of my CPTSD, I’m really sensitive to sudden movements, so if someone did this near me it would have scared the crap out of me and I would have looked up. \n\nI grabbed my daughter by the arm, turned her around quickly, and we headed to the front of the store to check out. She said as soon as she felt me grab her arm, she knew why without me even telling her. \n\nI’m glad it finally happened, partly because now I won’t fear it as much and because it happened in the best way it possibly could have. She didn’t see us, we were able to leave without any contact. \n\nI didn’t have a panic attack and neither did my daughter, we both had expected we would if this ever happened. My heart skipped a beat when I first saw her but that was it, it didn’t race or anything. I used to have worse reactions even just thinking of her.\n\nLastly, I find it really interesting to finally know what my reaction would be so that I don’t have to fear it anymore. \n\nI didn’t feel wistful, I didn’t feel nostalgic. My feeling was not one of love or anything you might imagine when seeing your own mother. Instead it was an instinctual and very visceral “get the hell away from this person and protect your daughter” kind of thing. \n\nI guess I still fear a situation where she sees me and tries to talk to me, but at least I’ll be better prepared now.",

        "text": "For the past week or so, I've been spending most of my free time reading about the effects of growing up with narcissistic parents. Although I knew my family was seriously dysfunctional and that my siblings and I were all emotionally abused as children (even now. It doesn't end.) this is all completely new to me. I've thrown around the idea of a narcissist in my head before, but I never really knew the details. Who knew that after a lifetime of terrible loneliness, hopelessness and feeling as though I was the only one who'd been through this I would find articles, subreddits, lectures, and more on the abuse that happened to me and my family?\n\nI'm in a state of shock and taking this all in. The first thing I stumbled upon was complex PTSD. Well I've been diagnosed with PTSD for two years now, but everything surrounding complex PTSD made it so much more real. After a life filled with shame, it can feel incredibly bad to see the hardest things you deal with as symptom bullet points on a webpage. Then I discovered dysfunctional family roles (I am the Lost Child) which really hit me. As a child, I often locked myself in my room for hours, only leaving to go to the bathroom. It was simply the only way to avoid the chaos. I've written journal entry after journal entry wondering why out of my five siblings, I feel so ignored and left out. Why is it everyone... and then me? Why do I feel like this in every facet of my life? For me to feel invisible, isolated and ignored within every group I'm in, that must to have been my fault. One of the worst feelings was ducking my head to go to the kitchen and QUIETLY get myself something to eat. My NDad, the one with the money, almost consistently restricted my eating habits. There were weeks where he would not go to the supermarket, or when there were very few things in the household to eat (and they were all things he liked to eat, exclusively.) HE could get by because HE was the adult, HE was the one with the power, he was the one with the money who could buy food or take out as he chose. I spent a great portion of my teenage life staying at friends' houses and later boyfriends' houses. Was I codependent on them? Yes. But it felt like a means of survival- why would I stay home with the living trauma when I could be with someone I love, in an environment where I know I'm safe? It felt good then, but it took me years to realize those friends were abusive towards me and bullied me greatly. All of my close friends know that I do not have people over my house. I just let someone from my past come over to watch a documentary and cuddle. Over the years, my house has become absolutely trashed and they know it, so this was a big trust thing for me.\n\nIt just feels like a pattern I can't get away from. I'm always questioning my relationships with people, especially the people closest to me. They are the people who I am the most comfortable around, but after a while with no contact (this could be hours, days or weeks and could be easily explained; they've been busy / nothing's wrong) I constantly wonder if there's something I did wrong/what I did to deserve their silence/what I can do better to avoid this hurt. My father has probably been using the silent treatment against me since the day I was born. I go to college a few hours away now and very conveniently when I'm \"far\" away from him he is extremely kind to me. It's like he's putting up a facade because he seems me doing so well, he wants to benefit from that positivity and tells himself (and me) that my greatness is all thanks to him in some way. I can't legally drink yet, but I have achieved a decent amount of success in my career so far. My dad posts about me on social media, brags about me to anyone he meets, and always tells me he's so proud of me when I'm far away from him. Despite all of this bullshit facade, whenever I'm home he ignores me and treats me as though he honestly hates me. My whole life I've felt like he hates me, which made me hate myself. I've asked myself so many times \"Why doesn't my father love me?\" The way he treats me publicly or when I'm far from home makes me feel like The Hero of the family. It makes me think.. don't use to me to pretend the way you treated us was fine just because we turned out well anyways! Dad, I may be successful, but I see challenges just trying to communicate with people both in the workplace and my daily life. The hateful, controlling, erratic side of him is an entirely different person compared to when my dad is in a \"good mood\". Now that I think about it, the whole world feels so much kinder, warmer, and overall comfortable when my dad is in a \"good mood.\" \n\nI feel so many of the effects. \nSelf care was never taught or emphasized, one of the results is that all 5 kids in my family have pretty bad dental issues, after never being taught the importance of self care/hygiene. Didn't care about brushing my teeth until I was 15, now at least half of my teeth are rotten. Haven't been to the dentist in years.. the list goes on.\nCommunication problems, so afraid of confrontation. \nAnd the memory problems.. like others, I do not remember almost all of my childhood. However I wonder if I regularly block everything out, because it's hard for me to remember big things that happened just a year or a few ago, or things that happened just a few weeks ago. I feel like this makes my relationships with new people harder because it's like we form memories, then I forget about them, so it feels like the bond isn't even there. I have such trouble connecting to new people.\nMy biggest disdain for myself, the way I freeze in public or in social situations when I'm uncomfortable/have an emotional flashback. I get so filled with shame sometimes out of nowhere that I completely freeze up, stop talking, and stop responding to the people talking to me. It feels so impossible to speak at times like this, sometimes people will say \"her\" when talking about me or even say my name and I say nothing because it does not even feel real that they're trying to talk to me.. I feel invisible. \n\nI don't have a therapist for a few reasons (I wish I had one, and I'm working on seeing a trauma therapist when I'm home over break) so I have no idea who to speak to about this. I feel like talking about it to my closest sibling would trigger him, because he's told me he's never read about narcissism. I feel like speaking to the rest of my siblings would yield mixed reactions as well. \n\nIf you read through my vent, thank you. There have been very few times in my life where speaking about all of this has been validating.",

I really care about my mother even though she does not understand what's going on.",

I was unfortunate to have had a relationship with a covert bully of an ex boyfriend (26/M), he is very psychologically and verbally abusive, and, I only found out too late: a pathological liar. \nWe split in April 2016.\n\nI had issues with ex's friends getting 'physical' with me and intimidating me, so I enrolled in a self defence class in January 2017. \n\nI ended up joining the people there regularly as they are all so supportive and friendly. They helped me gain a bit of confidence again and were the first friends I made after my ex turned EVERYONE against me. \n\nEx keeps expanding his story since we broke up. Its escalated to me now cheating on him and abusing him, whatever he fancies and whatever gives him most attention it seems. \nHence why I have problems with his friends \"teaching me a lesson\". \n\nEx also began stalking me, although I may be paranoid. He appeared in the car park of self defence class with his mates and shouted at me. He followed me around a nightclub which was noticed by a few other people. He also tried to block the road when I drove past him (he lives locally) but I got away. \n\nI have reported it btw, but just got told \"its in public places, it's probably coincidence, how can he be stopped!?\"...fair enough I guess. \n\nAnyway in summer 2017, ex and a load of his mates decided to book in to attend Self Defence class. Someone warned me so I avoided that particular session. Bit unnerving but thought it's just coincidence again. \n\nNext week, ex's even more thuggish brother (22/M) turns up, and starts attending regularly!\n\nEx-Brother of course acts charmingly at class, but I was still recovering from everything so I still feel so intimidated. \nIt also just plain ruined it for me. It was something I was doing for myself on the quiet, for my confidence going about my life with these idiots still trying to make trouble...plus I really liked my new friends \n\nI asked not to ever be put with Ex-Brother for practice, and the leaders agreed, but I think they don't realise the extent of what the situation was. \n\nI've told them a very brief version, because I don't want to be seen as a bitch ex-girlfriend making trouble. That's what I'm painted as! \n\nI was so worried that Ex-Brother would turn everyone against me and spread the old disgusting and false rumours (plus I did not want to be anywhere near him or anyone else he may bring along) that I gave up the class, quit the What app group and vanished. \n\nI feel much better these days, I've joined a couple more clubs and have a lovely new social circle. I still miss the SelfDefence people like mad though. \n\nI have two friends that practice a martial art with me, and they booked a place to practice....Ive just found out the place is the same place SelfDefence go to, and it will be the same time and room, everything...\nSo I'm going to definitely bump into the old group tomorrow evening.... I'm nervous as hell. \nWhat do I say if they have been turned against me and are horrible? What do I say at all, actually? \nHow can I cope hearing/seeing Ex-Brother showing off and staring at me the whole time? \nThanks for reading. Its gonna hurt seeing them training, I so want to go back but too scared.\n\ntl;dr: Left a group of friends in a self defence class due to lying narc ex and his smear campaign, I will be forced to see them tomorrow and need advice on what to say/stay calm",

I had struggled with employment for most of that time but finally have a great job with benefits that gives me everything I need and I can afford my own things now.\nNmom has a contract with Sprint (that ends next year) and uses the Location Services on me and my younger sisters to track where we are. When I ran away at 19 she used it to chase me to where I went (my friend’s house) but we called the police on her and they got her to leave. I did move back in, and then back out when I was 24 to my boyfriend’s house. I cannot be added to the lease bc of tax reasons so I have to keep going to Nmom’s house to get mail. Getting a UPS box soon though so I won’t have to go over there as much :)\n\nI am now 26, pay my own car and healh insurance, my car is paid off, I contribute to the utilities in the house, I am almost fully independent.  But my mom wants me to let her pay my phone bill. AND she wants me to pay my student loans AND the PP loan that was her decision to get, and is not eligible for income-based repayment. The loans under my name ($42,000~) are deferred until late next year, but the PP loans (19,000~)were not deferred and I have made two monthly payments on them (with some help from Ndad)\nI just don’t understand her logic..if no payment is made to the PP loan, she’s fucked. And I know that she took it out for MY education. But she absolves herself of any responsibility and dismisses the terms and conditions of the loan which she should be aware of honestly, since it is negatively affecting her credit. My conscience doesn’t allow me to leave her hanging, but I don’t understand why she has a problem with putting money towards the loan instead of: paying for the line, which if I got dropped and paid for own line, would save her $50 dollars; “remodeling the kitchen”, which she’s always talking about doing; going on trips and vacations; going shopping with my Nsisters..etc; \nShe wants to do “fun” stuff while I make payments to make her credit better for something I didn’t even ask for. If I was less naive at the time,  I would have told her to NOT to take out that loan. I will continue to make payments on it until next year, and hopefully Ndad will assist and it won’t be as hard on me. It’s better than trying to reason with her bc that would be an enormous headache. \n\nI’m trying to just dip out on having to deal with her as much while still remaining civil, and she’s making it really hard.\n\nP.S. I’ll be paying for the phone I already have and switching to Verizon :)",

She’d search and search for the tiniest flaws in my work and shove it in my face and act like it was a natural disaster and an emergency. I’d hang thousands of tags per day in my job and if something was mis-tagged she’d bring it to me and shove it up against my chest and tell me “it’s you’re job to make sure these tags are accurate and YOUR responsibility. You need to go check all the tags out there and make sure they’re right.” Checking all the tags is an hour task for each aisle that i can’t exactly squeeze into my day. I think she knows how ridiculous of a thing she is saying considering she had been in the business awhile. Anyway, I stuck around, kept doing my job and ignoring her insulting comments. When my anger was dangerously high i’d practice meditation when I got home from work. And finally three months later she announced she had accepted a job a few states away. I thought, thank god. I felt like she was fleeing because she knew she wasn’t going to “take over” this store with her negative behavior. So she went looking elsewhere, perhaps, for Nsupply. ",

        "text": "Hi guys,\nI’ve recently gone NC by writing my folks a letter and changing all my contact info. My dad showed up on my doorstep 3 days later, after finding out my address from a company I’d hired. He seemed genuine the first time we talked and then went back to his old tricks when he was invited back to talk. It’s made it clear that NC is definitely the best, and only, options. \n\nI feel relieved the worst had been dealt with (told him if he ever came by again I’d call the police, talked to security at work etc) but ever since preparing for NC I’ve been struggling with emotions of helplessness, inadequacy and just generally feeling bad about myself. I think the rubber band (of my mental health) got stretched too far too long and it’s started to have impact on my daily life. I felt this way before, when I was a teenager/early twenties and I lived with them. I hoped I’d never feel that way again and here we are. \n\n\nI feel like I don’t deserve the friends I have, or my partner, and feel like a weirdo and a fake when I try to talk to people. I feel like I have nothing of substance to offer them and it’s only about me. It feels lonely, and it keeps going in circles. \n\n\nI’ve just started a phd and I feel like I shouldn’t be there. I feel like I’m doing a terrible job, that my supervisor doesn’t like me, that he wishes he’d picked someone else. Part of it is that I am suppose to read papers and be critical to design a new experiment with the things they didn’t do (well enough). But with how I’m feeling and what has been going on, I can’t focus. And I also keep doubting if I’m critical enough, if I’m reading it well enough. If I’m really understanding what it means (which sounds a lot like gaslighting side effects). There’s a general fog in my head that makes me forget almost everything in seconds after, and I feel like I do know certain things but can’t reach them. It makes it hard to convey what I’ve done in meetings. \nMy partner says I worry too much and am not doing  badly, that my supervisor is there to guide me and that I’m too scared of him. But I feel anxious before our meetings because I  feel like he thinks that I shouldn’t be working with him because I don’t know enough about the topic and don’t read well enough. I spoke to him a bit about it before and he said he was happy with the direction we went in, but said that he felt I was unprepared the past week (right after my dad came by) and said that I should write a proposal for this week to give me some direction. Somehow I feel like others must know more and do better... \n\n\nI know that it’s probably depression, I’ve noticed that I have almost all of the symptoms and I’ve had it before. I’m worried that it will further impact my life, and specially the job I have dreamed about for years. I’ve told my supervisor some of it, and have applied for a counselor at the uni, but I feel like I’ve not been doing well since I started and I should really do better now. \n\n\nCan anyone give me some advice, or help?

Basically klonopin made not care about the little piece of artogant, spoiled that supposedly, I am. \nI don't take klonopin anymore because it also made me unable to study, read or learn anything.  \nNow I'm off medication (through I've been trough a couple since that long year with klonopin) and none had work.  \nBut honestly, I'm afraid. In this particular case, I'm afraid of therapy.  \nTo make matters worse, I'm afraid of failing or therapy not working and falling back to that really scary dark place. \nTo make matters even worse, I live in a rural third world country where family is everything.  \nBasically, what I'm saying is that I'm shit scared. Anyone else? ",

Which is quite strange because my nmother was a clean freak. But, if I didn't, she would acuse me of \"stealing\" food ir hiding my apparent gluttony.  \nThis would often lead me to wait for her to come home, in the kitchen, so I could announce that... I was hungry, therefore I made a sandwich. To which she often would reply with sarcasm, or grudge or anger about bothering her again.  \nThose answers were always better than the humilition show she would put me trough though, have I not \"confess\" I had eaten.  \nSo I made a sandwich a couple minutes ago. My so is coming home shortly and I caught myself standing in the kitchen just... Waiting. Waiting for him to come home so I can start cleaning (basically put the bread away and wash my plate). Me standing there is something that came naturally. I didn't thought of it, It was just the \"right thing to do after eating\". But it started to bother me after a couple of minutes and a voice popped inside my head: \"wtf are you doing standing there?\". And, just like that, a wave of memories washed trough my mind.  \nI stood there for a couple of minutes, still, but this time because I was too shocked to move. It was like I was in the movies, watching a tape unfold scenes of the past, starring me, nmother and food. Huh.  \nI put the bread away and washed my plate. ",

I was right, unfortunately. His text concluded that the 4 characters were \"in their own way\" looking for the same thing: a meaning of life without a god, generalizing it to all Bergman's art. (I wonder what it did add to the perspective of the film).\n\n\nDavid, besides the disappointment and sadness which his selfishness causes in his daughter and son (who sadly still have a reverence to him as \"father\") is caught up and confronted by his son-in-law.  \n\nHe invented a word salad mental gymnastics about his existencial crisis, but is immediately confronted by the SonIL that IT'S STILL ABOUT HIM, not his daughter (who is suffering from a illness in progression with no perspective of cure).\n\n\nHe tries to keep his image intact: that's all he cares about, despite the crying in the beginning of the film (as all narcs, he cries and suffers only for/about himself).\n\n\nThere's a moment in which David asks his SonIL if he had wished that Karin (daughter/ wife) was dead - it would solve all the problems. SonIL is astonished and realizes and says that he, David, doesn't understand anything, he's a robot.\n\n\nPretty sadly, the young son, keeps his illusion of his father as a normal person (at the end, this really did sting me at this time, it totally reminds Alice Miller's analysis of artists and their abusive parents, and the idealization that is kept at the highest cost).\n\n\nTL; DR QUESTION: Am I wrong in that interpretation? I'd be grateful to have your honest and direct feedback.\n\n\nPS.: Maybe even the director, Bergman, didn't portray the character David as a Narc - he's evil, but to portray an extremely \"bad\" person would be seen as immaturity.

I'd like to share my story to get it off my chest.\n\n I used to work with a coworker in a small family run bakery who wanted me to leave for months and tried some silly mind games to upset me. Incredibly intitially I really liked them, they were quite charming and fun to work with.\n\n I dont want to go into specifics. They dont even matter. Just to say they were ongoing and obvious but subtle enough If I was to address it like \"whats your problem?\" I would look like I'm the one over reacting. \n\nAnyway they didnt like me, so tried to mess with me. Their behaviour and antics was like clockwork, a very obvious pattern. I spotted it early on but reserved judgment but damn it became apparent they were on a mission.\n\nThey would be pretending to be friendly , and then go and do something or say something that they thought would unsettle me, and then they would observe my reaction , watching me with a smirk. \n\nSometimes it was like holding out something they thought I wanted or needed and then taking it back ,letting me know that not today, but tomorrow you can or  might get it.\n\nI never took any of the bait and something in my gut told me not to believe anything about them.\n\n\nIt was very curious to me at first. The first time it happened it sent up a little red flag, and then it happened again I knew they were intentionlly playing mind games.Trying to unnerve me, belittle  me, sometimes passive aggressive bullshit to let me know they think I dont belong.  It happened many times after.\n\nSomething told me not to react or even let on that I knew what they were trying to do. Give them nothing, dont let em see me get pissed off or even become passive aggresive back, dont even roll your eyes at their efforts to unbalance you.. I continued like I didnt know what was going on. As a matter of fact I was fairly polite and friendly with them the whole time.\n\nA few years earlier and maybe they would have made me a nervouse and emotional wreck, thankfully I matured a bit and am less naive now than then. Now even more so after encountering this fucker.\n\nThe pattern was so obvious I knew there had to be some sort of label or description for this type of behaviour and thats how I found out about manipulative narcisists. \n\nThat fuckin smirk man, observing, looking for any sign of me being upset , angry or anxious.\n\nAnyways I did eventually leave, and I never gave them the drama they were probably looking for, no argument, no accusations , no asking for gods sakes why? Or telling them Haha I know what your up to and listing all the bullshit they pulled. Thats what they wanted, It would have made me look crazy. \n\nso there thats my outline of dealing with someone who went out of their way to mess with me. I was a no-one, polite quiet factory worker,  probably an easy target for them. What made it worse was that i actually really liked them in the beginning. I guess I am naive after all.\n\n\n",

        "text": "Nparents were harder on me when I was dating her. Way back 6 years ago we dated. After the first time we had sex (three months into the relationship) the relationship started to die. Mostly because afterward she would distance herself emotionally from me for like 2 weeks. It felt like it was my punishment or something. She generally would give me the cold shoulder. This lasted a few months until Nparents finally convinced me to leave her. Dunno if that was the right decision...\n\nRecently we talked and she was working as a stripper. I actually visited her at her strip club which was really taking me out of my comfort zone. It was a cool new experience. When my Nparents found out they freaked. Told me she's never allowed at the house, etc, etc. This just pissed me off because they took a super righteous high ground about it like they're so above me and her. It just pissed me so bad. And the past repeated... i dumped her again, for my Nparents.\n\nI remembered her Snapchat name which is also her stage name for her stripping. Well she started doing porn as well... actual intercourse and everything. I don't know why but i keep going back to looking to what she's doing now. She was my first (and only one i'd had sex with). When I see her in these videos it just really makes me sad. I don't know why. I mean I watch videos like that. Should i be ashamed? I dunno. But for some reason watching her makes me want to cry. **I was hers and she was mine... and now she's everyones...** It just... is hard. Am i just jealous? Not sure what's happening. Is this related to my feelings of codependency brought about my Narcissism... ? I have no idea. \n\nI just know since I dated her I haven't been able to date close with anyone. And that was five years ago. I just feel nauseous still after seeing her twitter page filled with nude pictures of herself. Also i feel judgmental and a hypocrite. Blegh. \n\nI've dated once since, it lasted seven months and that girlfriend was super distant. We worked together at the same job and she wouldn't even talk to me at work or look my way. Would agree on a date once a week but didn't really connect with me. I want to connect with people again.",

I added a second letter that replied to an earlier letter my Nmom sent me in which she wrote why she had done what she'd done (it really missed the point and was actually rather mean).\n\n\nI was starting to feel better until I got home from work and my Edad crossed the street towards me. He broke down and asked if we could talk. When I let him in, he cried profusely and said he was so sorry for me after reading the letter. He said my mom admitted to all of it and asked for his forgiveness and how he wasn't sure it was going to work between them anymore. After a longer talk, in which he apologised for not seeing it before and for what had happened, he asked me if there was any way he could stay in my life.\n\nAfter talking to my partner, I called him back over because I hadn't been able to say things I wanted (how I didn't understand that he didn't see it, why did he not stop her in certain situations). It felt like my dad's attitude changed when he came back again, like he felt he was let back in my life. I tried to talk to him about narcissism and explained the symptoms (almost all my mom has). He listened, and talked about his experience with her, but it didn't seem to hit. When I told him how I asked her if she liked me and she didn't reply with more than 'a good sense of humor', his mouth pulled into a weird smile. He also said that he thought we were very different people and if we weren't, the talk would've meant something different in ways of interpretation. The lies he previously told me he was so angry about, he now called little lies. He said that he wondered if it had to do with her childhood, that she says was lonely and loveless. He had previously said that he wasn't sure he could stay with her anymore if he'd lose me because of what she had done, but I felt his tone change to pity and sympathy for her. Something that he has always used to 'solve' our fights.\nI gave him my only option: I can consider letting you in, if you are not tied to my mom anymore.\n\n\nHe had a hard time coming to terms with this and asked me in several different ways if it couldn't be different (he could get a secret second phone, could he not just come over on his own). I answered no and tried to explain why. After he left I broke down and cried. I felt violated. He had been here for 2 days waiting outside my door, and said he considered going to my work if he hadn't seen me. The second time he was here my gut tells me something was off, but my head questions it and wonders if I am too harsh on him.\n\n\nThis morning he texted me again, saying he had more questions for me and if he could come by again. After the meltdown last night and hardly sleep, I texted him no. That I didn't want to wait and see what would happen between them, and didn't want to put that choice on him. How he's tied to her and she clearly influences him, and that I don't want her around in any capacity. That it means I won't ask him to divorce her, but that I will also not be in contact with both of them. That I understand he came by, but to never do it again. And that I wished him the best, because I did care about him. He replied and said he would respect that, and asked if they could send a joint letter for closure.\n\n\nI feel horrible. I feel like I can no longer leave my house without worrying if he is somewhere, if he will show up at my work anyway. I wonder if I made the wrong choice to cut my dad off too, and if I interpreted his second visit wrong. I felt like my letter was a good call, but seeing him this upset and asking to be in my life has made me wonder if I am giving my dad up while he could still be around. I'd like to think he could be, which is why I even considered giving him the option I did, but I do know that Eparents, like Nparents, hardly ever change because they're too entangled. And I am not sure I could deal with that level of stress again.",

        "text": "**TL:DR I was treated poorly by my Eye Care facility (located in Nparents town). I posted a Google Review of 1 star and commented how I felt about their service to me (they act like passive aggressive narcs which triggered Nparent memories). They found out I posted the review because I had just got off a call with them and they get alerted about new reviews. I switched to a much better Eye Care facility in my current city. I did not tolerate abuse like a scapegoat is taught to... I was “caught” being authentic.**\n\nSo, after going NC with Nparents I have been trying to spot and remove toxic pieces of my life that cause me stress. One of these, oddly, is my old town’s Eye Care facility. I purchased my glasses from them and recently have been trying contact lenses...\n\nEvery time I go in that place the recepetionist looks at me like im some freak, wide eyed, then starts looking at the ground (or anywhere but my eyes). Mutters something like “what are you here for” or “did you need something” irritably. She is this way on the phone too. Well after a call recently I was so pissed. She sounded rude and unavailable on the phone as if she had better people to be talking to... instead of asking if i could be put on hold she said “im gonna put you on hold” and just did it without waiting for a reply. Then she was asking me to supply her with random information that i don’t have... their computer system has it. Things like “what is your insurance” ... when I’ve been registered with them for nearly two years. Or about what my lens prescription is. Honestly i’d let the incompetence pass if there wasn’t a huge condescending manner about her along with meanness. Her dismissiveness and shortness with me triggered memories of how Nparents act toward me. When I talked with her about when I could pick up my lenses she said “uh it usually takes about a week. Ive gone ahead and ordered them. We might not be able to get them but since we sampled you a pair last week im guessing we will probably be able to. So we’ll call if there’s a problem but if you dont hear from us youre all good.” Im like wtf. How about “we’ll call you when youre contacts arrive so you can fucking get what you just paid $100 for.” Even though i was angry and frustrated i ended the call with a pleasant goodbye and she muttered a “uh huh” or something. \n\nSo after that i was stewing for a bit while trying to get my mind off of it. Then i started feeling like this place has made me their bitch... i mean i’m paying them for a service. Why would I spend my hard worked for money just to be treated like shit? Why do that when I actually have options? There are tons of other Eye Care places that are actually nice to people and are in my city (instead of my old town 40 minutes away).\n\nSo i was mad so i decided I’d log into my Google Account and place a review online for the shitty customer service i’ve been getting. Their ratings so far had been near perfect 4.8/5 stars. I put a real dent in it by giving them a 1 out of 5 stars. I spoke briefly, in the review, about my constant poor experience with the girl at the greetings desk (the one who also answers phone calls).\n\nWell i think they get alerts when a review comes in. Because soon after i got a call back from the Eye Care place. I recognized the voice as one of the Eye doctors there. She sounded really sympathetic and almost whimpering. She was talking about how she could have my new sample contact lenses for me to wear until my new contact lenses came in. I felt that she definitely knew about the review i posted online. \n\nThis is when i said “Actually i was wanting to go ahead and cancel those contact lenses I just ordered. I have recently moved towns and it’s kind of out of my way to have to drive so far. I was wanting forms about my prescription information so that I could switch to an Eye Care location in my new town.” \n\nThen she sounded heartbroken. She was like “.... so you want to cancel them...?” I’m like “Yep.” She’s like “We could order them and mail them to you...” And i was like “I just want to cancel that order.” Then she’s like “okay... i will have your prescription information and sample pair for you to pick up..” I said a nice thank you and by. And she let out a sobby “bye.” Im like lmao this is someone with a college degree in a professional setting, acting like a fucking Narcissist. She’s acting passive aggressive... acting like this matter is personal. Lol no i pay for your service and your people cant manage a smile or making eye contact so youre not getting my money... it’s that simple.\n\nSo i felt awesome just sweeping by, picking up my free sample pair of contacts and prescription information (with the mean receptionist who probably knew about my review post, standing right there). Someone other than the receptionist brought my contacts to me... as if the receptionist was too hurt by my Google Review to serve me. Though, the receptionist was with a normal client, but usually they have me wait.\n\nIt’s just baffling to me how they start acting nice after i call them out on their shit. Had i not said a thing it would have just kept happening. Now im with a new Eye Care place in my new town and the place has a new modern beautiful look to it and very efficient work ethic ... and patient and caring employees. \n\nI made a move for me. I treated myself good with this move. I stood up for myself; i knew i didnt HAVE to take someone’s meanness.. This is real progress for me. A scapegoat like me finally being okay with protesting wrongful behavior.",

I believe the article I posted about Armisen and what some of the scandals going on in Hollywood aren't so different... they share a deeply rooted misogyny that has been normalized.\n\nBut what really bothered me was how people were diminishing his misogyny, his emotionally abusive and predatory behavior into a \"womanizer\", someone in a \"dysfunctional\" relationship, or simply an \"asshole\"\n\nThere are many assholes like him and it would be a disservice to their community and to the real victim of abuse (sexual and child abuse) \n\nEmotional/ Psychological abuse not being considered as much is such a huge double standard I think...\n \nMaybe I feel heated, wasting my time in this because I relate to the victims pain so much... and should confront my own demons. But I don't think guys like Armisen should roam and feel *too* comfortable out there. \n\nI wish I knew about them and knew how to protect myself against these people sooner. \n\nI would like to know what other narcissists victim think about this... is it far fetched?\n\n(English isn't my first language, I apologize ) ",

        "text": "Hello all! I’ve posted a bit on RBN in the past but the TL;DR is that my mom is an NMom and I’ve been fully NC for two years now, three with the exception of one phone call. \n\n\nI was the GC growing up and my sister the SG. I learned early on that the key to a peaceful life was agreeing with/doing whatever mother said. I had to push down my own opinions and personality because me being a functional human was not the goal. I was supposed to be a little doll. \n\n\nI’ve dealt with physical, emotional, financial, and sexual abuse. I tried for several years to talk to her, to try to work through our issues so we could have a healthy adult relationship. I’m sure you all can guess how that went. Gaslighting, saying she doesn’t remember, getting her boyfriend to try to guilt-trip me, all the usual tricks. I finally just gave up after she refused to apologize for a single thing and only wanted to double down on how she’s always the victim. \n\n\nI’ve tried my best to keep my sister and my father and the rest of the family out of it. I feel like the issues are between me and mom and it’s no one else’s business. I know she has spread a bunch of stuff around about me but luckily most of my family is either firmly on my side or staying out of it. Ive had some longer talks with Dad (they’re divorced) and it helped him understand everything that I went through while he was away at work (military) as well as continuing issues through college and on. He finally put serious boundaries in place and refuses to be a FM for Mom anymore. \n\n\nThe issue now and what I need advice on has to do with my sister. She’s pregnant and I’m over the moon excited. I am firmly childfree (terrified of becoming my mother as well as of her ever being near a child) and this will most likely be my sister’s only child. She and her boyfriend are coming to my place for Thanksgiving and we’re surprising them with a cake and tons of presents for my little soon-to-be nephew. She’s having her baby shower in February. I really feel like going would be a mistake since Mom will be there. No matter what, Mom will be drama, but I feel like “excited grandma” drama is better than “sitting in a corner while weeping loudly yet heroically soldiering through” drama. My sister really wants me to be there and wants us to talk about it. I just want this day to be all about my sister and I know that my presence there will disrupt that because of how Mom will react. I know eventually we’ll have to be in the same room together for a funeral or wedding or something but my sister’s baby shower just doesn’t seem like the place. \n\n\nSo do I just lay everything on the line and tell her about all the stuff Mom did to me so she understands why I went NC and why that’s not going to change? She’s made a comment about how we need to just move past everything and get over it but to me that means mom just once again gets away with everything and I just have to suck it up and rug sweep to keep her happy. Just like I always have, all my life. I want sis to know how much I love her and how excited I am to be an aunt. I don’t want to drag her into the middle of things and I don’t need her to pick a side. I just need her to understand why things are this way and why they’re not going to change. \n\n\nThere’s so much more but I’m trying to not get too mired in details here. If there are questions or anything I’m happy to answer them. Thanks in advance for all advice! And if this isn’t the right subreddit for this, please let me know. ",

        "text": "I'm a Nina Simone fan and I've had \"Feeling Good\" on repeat for 15 minutes. Don't judge. LOL \n\nMy mother is a abusive narcissist. My father enables her out of fear. Since I was twelve, my mom used me as a counselor for their marriage even though she made it clear that I wasn't good enough for her. I am the only daughter out of four children and I believe that my mother was very envious of how doting my father has been to me.\n\nThe physical and emotional abuse from my mother led to severe mental health issues and I left home at 21 to get away from her. I was living in poverty but I didn't care. I have had a total of 4 years of therapy and I will be on medication for the rest of my life. I have Complex PTSD, Bipolar disorder and OCD. I spent my late teens and early twenties engaging in self harm. I also was also in and out of hospitals. I've been in toxic relationships with men and I endured very unhealthy friendships. Therapy helped me find my self worth again and now I'm very selective about whom is in my life. \n\nI'm 35 now and I'm living a great life. I'm married to a loving and supportive man who spoils me. I don't even have to work. We choose not to have children. We bonded over having batshit mothers who were honest about disliking us. In fact, we eloped because we didn't want their controlling and toxic behavior around us on our wedding day. My husband and I enjoy travelling the world and spending time with each other. \n\nI've come to realize that whenever I talk to my mother, she is either insulting me or demanding that I buy her something.  This woman has closets full of clothes that she doesn't wear yet she always wants more. My mother is jealous of my happy marriage because she and my father hate each other. She has told me that she wishes she had a husband like mine. A few months ago, she said \"I respect your husband for taking you because not a lot of men would.\" That comment made something click in my head. I  accepted that my mother will never be kind to me. I also gave myself permission to start a low contact relationship based entirely on my terms. My husband believes that this would be best since he's seen the effects of my mother on me. He can't stand her because she is rude, cruel, demanding and she has bad manners. \n\nThis morning, I blocked my parents' phone numbers. I will speak to them a few times a year and it will always be on speakerphone with my husband present. The conversations will not last longer than 5 minutes. I haven't felt this free since I left home. I should have done this a long time ago but I wasn't ready. \n\nThanks for reading. ",

Of course, it is important to treat others kindly and mindfully, paying deference to their autonomy, thoughts, and feelings. That's common decency and especially important with your loved ones. I feel that I do this the best I can with my husband, and he with me, though any time we have small tensions or things to work through, I get this obsessive feeling that anything I say that is in any way disapproving or disliking of his actions is great disrespect, even after we have a calm conversation and work things out. I frequently tell him of my worries that I don't treat him well enough, much to his bewilderment - he gently tells me that he feels very loved and respected.\n\nSo I asked myself this morning - why am I still having these thoughts? Then it hit me:\n\n*In order to survive my mother's narcissism, I had to have these thoughts. My treatment of her was never kind enough or respectful enough for her.*\n\nHuh. It's like I've been trained to be on high alert for possible blow-ups about not getting enough respect or gratitude. /s\n\nDAE have obsessive thoughts like this?

That triggered an episode where I ended up stewing over how my nmother would nag and complain about how we never compliment her cooking (she _literally_ and I mean that in the correct sense of the word-- would start this nagging and complaining as soon as the food hits my tongue. She doesn't even give a chance for anyone to naturally give a compliment it's like she needs us to instantaneously cream our pants like we've never creamed before in order for her to feel validated so obviously she never got a whole lot of it but it always triggers me into thinking about how if she actually cooked amazing food and give us some fucking space to compliment her on our own accord she might actually get some validation instead of complaining all the goddamn time. And she would never look up a recipe because according to her she can \"figure out\" any recipe just by looking at it so we would often eat food that looks good but tastes at best bland--and she also forbid me from using any of \"her\" kitchen equipment and would pack the fridge so full of \"her\" ingredients that I couldn't ever buy or cook for myself reliably while living with them.\n\nSo how do I stop feeling like \"goddamn if she/he/etc would just take care of their personal issues then they could get what they want\"?

        "text": "Hi everyone.\n\nI'm on mobile, so I can't read the rules, but to be on the safe side I'm adding a trigger warning for alcoholism, and attempted murder.\n\nI posted about this in a thread in RBN, but it's still lingering on my mind.\n\nI'm not sure if this is the right place, since I'm not 100% sure if my mum qualifies as a narcissist. She was definitely manipulative though, and due to her alcoholism my childhood was a mess until my much older sister took me in.\n\nI lived with my mum for a year when I was 12, as she had been sober for a while and I was entering high school so I was leaving friends behind anyway. I was a kid, but my sister wanted me to have the choice to have a relationship with her.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since the end of that year.\n\nMy dad passed away when I was a baby. Throughout his life, he developed asthma, sleep apnoea, and lung cancer. This is relevant because I was discussing this with my fiancé when he was complaining that my snoring has been worse while I've had the flu. \n\nI don't know why my brain decided that this was the moment, 12 years later, to make the connection.\n\nMy mum tried to kill me when I was 12 from suffocation with a pillow. I think she simply planned that method because to her it would be the easiest and cleanest. I doubt she intentionally chose it because of how it relates to my dad's breathing problems and eventual death. It's a sick, twisted irony that has left me shattered.\n\nI'm sure there are some who may be horrified that I can speak about this so frankly. I guess I've kinda disassociated the last couple of days. I've been avoiding telling my siblings because I don't want to mess them up with this either. I told my fiancé, but he can't relate and I think he feels like I've gotten over it by now. He doesn't really know what to do, and neither do I. \n\nSo I'm here. And I don't really know what I want to gain from this, but I'm just tired of feeling so emotionally drained. And I know that may sound off alarm bells for some people, but I can promise that I'm not suicidal or self harming. Just struggling to wrap my head around it.\n\nSo yeah. Sorry for the long post.",

So anytime I cook a meal it takes like two hours after to calm down.",

        "text": "So two days ago I declared myself done with my ex who along with having NPD also has BPD.  During the year and a half i was with her I've went through tons of abuse in the hope she would see that I love her and would be there for her no matter what.  Obviously I was wrong and massively ignorant to what these people do to others with no remorse.\n\nDuring all this time I kept thinking to go to the lefty side of Facebook to look for advice but had the feeling I'd be marked as \"demonizing NPDs\" which is not what I wanted to do at all.  Instead of taking that risk I stayed silent about my abuse, which I knew wasn't good, outside of my friends list.\n\nFast-forward to yesterday.  I mentioned in a theoretical anarchist society what would become of NPDs.  I wasn't trying to nor did I give the impression I wanted harm to come of them, but I said near the end \"I personally wouldn't want to live with them\". Apparently that means I'm a genocidal monster, a narcissist, and various other things.\n\nToday, after getting banned from said group I decided to go to a mental health group on Leftbook and after asking \"What would be the right sort of treatment for someone who has been the victim of a narcissist for more than a year? (verbatim)\", I got chewed up by two people, another posted a link to help out only to yank it down minutes later, and another suggested writing about it and a few other things.  In short I ended up giving up not even an hour into it.\n\nWhere can I go for help? I'm done with the partner so there's no need for help on that part.  I'm looking for advice that will work instead of being treated like shit because I'm asking about something which comes specifically from people with NPD.  It wasn't just one thing that happened, but rather a gamut of things.  I'm not looking to mistreat them, just to heal from the trauma of what happened.",

To compensate, I'm taking community college classes for my senior year (I still grad. high school, just no high school classes). \n\nI'm writing my college applications right now, and I know I need to talk about what happened between my mom and I in order to explain my junior year grades. I don't know how to talk about her and what happened, because I'm still really conditioned to make the situation sound like nothing happened. How can I safely open up while making the focus of my statement still on me? \n\nLove you guys.\n\n(I have gotten some questions about this from other people - I'm applying to U. of WA, Western WA U., Brown U., Carnegie Mellon U., Reed College, Santa Clara U., U. of Pittsburgh, and Stanford. Stanford is on a dare, but I'm going to put my all into it.)",

        "text": "The voice of my narc parents lives on as a sector of my mind (subconscious/conscious) that whispers criticisms to me. Sometimes it’s hard to notice it but it’s there. The most effective way of me fighting it seems to be visualizing it as a separate thing and telling it “No” and “Stop” and “Shut up” when it starts telling me that people don’t like me or that i’m not strong enough... or something else. I talk to it and tell it it’s going to dissolve into nothing and that it can protest all it wants but in the end I will win. It’ my mind and i’m ordering the critic to leave for good. It’s hard work...\n\nAlso i battle the critic that projects the way my narc parents treated me onto others... i constantly fear that who I’m talking to is going to be just like my parents and use/abuse/neglect and not appreciate me. So im battling that critic with positive thought substitution. I acknowledge the positive traits of others and remind myself that i’m not in danger and that most people are peaceful and kind and that it’s okay to trust.\n\nOf course battling the critic causes emotional flashbacks. When this happens I just lay in bed and play my favorite music and grieve about some of the abusive things that happened to me.\n\nUsing this site for help currently http://pete-walker.com/shrinkingInnerCritic.htm",

        "text": "I still need to elaborate, and maybe the therapist I am currently seeing is going to help me in this, and on the long run. But I feel so good and great and free, that I have desire to go outside and do things! Wash my car! (what the heck?...weird...) Go see friends, go to cinema, travel, walk, learn new things...\n\nI am finally fine.......\n\nSince I was a child I was in toxic relationships, and I spent more than 30 years in feeling I had to care about who was giving a lot of love to me, I had to be always over careful about what I was doing, how I was, how I acted. I killed my self, I allowed doubt inside me, and I became what these people wanted me to be. I put myself aside. But I finally sufocated, and eventually everything was my fault, and I tended to see everything as my fault. The truth is \"something\" is my fault, that I exist as well.\n\nUnfortunately I understood this only with a therapist, and I started to see what a friendship, or a relationship involving any sort of love, meant. Freedom. And that my feelings were right. I felt sick all this time, and I was not getting why. I felt that the relationship I was having with some people was extremely unhealthy and was suffocating me.\n\n**I want to share what that therapist said to me, and that changed my life for the good:**\n*\"Imagine that you, like an house, have an enclosure, a containment, and a door that gives access to your space. Until now people entered your space as they want, doing what they wanted. Now it is ok to close the door and let in only the people you want\"*.\n\nAutomatically, I wanted a bunch of them to be out, and I could not understand why. I felt guilt, and blamed myself. Then I started reading about toxic relationships and narcissistic behavior. And then I started my journey in **create boundaries** I didn't have, and having healthy behavior in relationships.\nAnd at the end discovered I was and have been victim of abuses and toxic friends.\n\nYesterday I cut off a friend since we were children, and that I always felt there was something not ok about him. He destroyed me. I terminated our relationship. He is out of my life. And I feel finally fine.\n\n**I want also to thank all the people that, here on these subreddits, helped me, with energy and their time. I really appreciate it. I will never forget it.**\n\n**Thanks a lot...**\n\n\n*Edit: thanks really a lot for your messages and support! Everyone is worth being loved! No matter what!*\n\n\n*Edit 2: I realized that this will to live is not \"per se\" but related to a desire of living again with other friends with which I grew up really, and with which we never talked about friendship so much. People with which it just happened, and with every of them I share a particular kind of relationship and friendship, maybe only unconditional love, with very rare moments of sharing something. Maybe friendship is only another cage. Maybe there is people, and us, and maybe we should love ourselves, our shell, our soul, and share this with others, giving more than receiving, cause it feels good!*",

However, she continues to find ways to manipulate and do things to make things difficult. I've been researching narcissism and reading some self-help blogs and books.  So much of what is said to describe the narcissist are things that my ex would accuse me of doing, but her accusations were usually baseless. For example, she accused me of caring more about my friends than I cared about her. In truth, after we got married, I rarely saw my friends—going months at a time without even interacting with them, because I knew there would be problems if I did. But she would go out with her girlfriends every weekend. Things like that. \n\nEven though time has passed, I can still hear her in my head, telling me how disappointing I was to her. Those thoughts show up in the least opportune moments. How do you control those thoughts and feelings? Does it just take time? Therapy? Does anyone else hear their N in their head all the time?\n\nEdit: cleanup",
