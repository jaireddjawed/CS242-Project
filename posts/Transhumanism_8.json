The rats were trained in an enclosure with two levers and a light above each. The left- or right-hand light would flash, and the rats learned to press the corresponding lever to receive a reward. Then they were separated, and each fitted with electrodes to the motor cortex, connected via computers that sampled brain impulses from one rat (the “encoder”), and sent a signal to a second (the “decoder”). The “encoder” rat would see one light flash—say, the left one—and push the left-hand lever for his reward; in the other box, both lights would flash, so the “decoder” wouldn’t know which lever to push—but on receiving a signal from the first rat, he would go to the left as well.\n\nOf course we're a long way from being able to do this with humans, but it's exciting research! And relevant to Elon Musk's wizard hat idea. ( [https://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html](https://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html) if you're not familiar.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/transhumanism/comments/9ghp1r/on_major_markets_for_cybernetics_and_other/",
        "text": "This came to mind tonight while I was mulling over the possibilities of technologies we could see developing in areas like cybernetic enhancements, body modifications, and the outgrowths we could see coming from Bright Green Environmentalism to improve the condition of Earth's current environment. Almost everyone I've talked to in the past five years since I first began to actively follow Transhumanism has never heard of it, and those who I've explained it to are normally less than enthused to learn about it. That in mind, while I see the potential benefits of developing these technologies, I'm wondering when or even if they will actually prove to be successful. \n\nI'd like to go over some of the markets where I believe transhumanism has the potential to gain some ground and develop, as well as offer a few concerns I have about the challenges that we may see as we move forward.\n\n_________________________________________________\n\n**Military Technology**\n\nWhat I believe to be the most profitable market for companies developing cybernetic technologies is that of the military market. This is also a pretty big concern of mine because regardless of the performance of cybernetic enhancements in the global market, various nations will see the potential in purchasing and/or funding the development of these technologies to make their military capabilities far greater than currently possible. So I could see the various Governments of the world paying a lot of money to companies developing Cybernetics, and thus ending up with a situation akin to Lockheed-Marten where the vast majority of that company's annual profits comes from governments paying for their products. \n\nIf this is the case, which realistically I believe that this could indeed be what ends up happening, some of the more significant cybernetic enhancements that could be developed would be restricted only to military and police personnel. Much like how several military vehicles and military technologies are prohibited from being owned by civilians. \n\nThis concern is worthy of an entire discussion on its own because of the potential implications of major world governments weaponizing cybernetic enhancements and other transhumanist technologies could have on the future of our civilizations. I would love to hear some thoughts on this, but there are other markets that have potential as well that could become highly beneficial to everyone that I'd like to go over as well.\n\n________________________________________________\n\n**Environmental Technologies**\n\nArguably my foremost concern in today's world is that of the Earth's environment. I believe in Biological Immortality over Mind Uploading/Digital Immortality and want to spend a lot of time on Earth before exploring other parts of our planetary system. The development of Bright Green Environmentalism as a movement has given me a lot of optimism about the future of our world's environment. \n\nThe increasing concern for the environment by both ordinary people and large companies within the past several decades leaves a lot of potential for profits to be made by companies developing advanced technologies designed to improve the Earth's current environmental conditions. \n\nThis one seems to be gaining a lot of ground in recent years with more and more advanced water purification technologies and growing interest in cleansing the world's oceans of pollution so that more people around the world have access to clean drinking water. No real concerns here from my perspective, but I'd like to hear if any of you are worried about advancements in this area that I'm not aware of. \n\n________________________________________________\n\n**Medical Technologies**\n\nPerhaps where I'm the most optimistic about transhumanism is in the realm of medicine. The potential developments we could see in the realm of medicine within the next decade alone are exciting and give me a lot of hope for the future. \n\nOne of the most often discussed subjects I see on this subreddit is that of the developments of advanced prosthetic limbs for amputees or other disabled people. Which I think is an area, alongside the more recent work in the development of artificial organs, that could lead to a more positive perception of developing cybernetics. \n\nFurthermore, and of more personal interest to me as a Biological Immortalist, is the developments in the fields of anti-ageing and regenerative medicine to perpetuate one's life as long as one desires. While I doubt that the market for immortality would be as large as I would like it to be, I imagine that the market for anti-ageing and regenerative medical products would be quite profitable and something that could lead to a more positive public view of the transhumanist movement.\n\nThe greatest concerns I have in this area are the potential ethical disagreements people could have over the concept of people being able to live well past their natural lifespan, either for religious or personal reasons. Could lead to a lot of social tension between those who choose to pursue a longer lifespan or even immortality, and those who disagree and believe we should only live as long as we were naturally meant to. Regardless of the logic for either side, the probability of serious ethical debates about this when the possibility for biological immortality comes into the picture is very high. \n\n_____________________________________________\n\n**Reflection and Concerns on the Public Opinion of Transhumanism**\n\nWhile these areas have significant potential to be profitable for companies developing technologies for these markets, this rounds back to my original concern: \n\nThe lack of attention and/or interest in the potential developments in transhumanist technologies by the general populace. Furthermore, ethical and cultural disagreements over the extent to which these technologies could and/or should be developed could stifle development and sour public opinions on transhumanism as well. \n\nIt's natural for our brains to focus on what we perceive to be threats and respond accordingly with apprehension and skepticism, it's built into our most basic drives for survival. Recent research from people at prestigious universities like UC-Berkeley have come to compile substantial evidence in favor of the view that people value closely-held opinions and the influence of strong emotions over concrete facts and logic. So if the general public comes to view transhumanism as antithetical and/or threatening to their worldviews and personal values, it could lead to the entire movement being painted negatively as a result. Regardless of the definite benefits that could result from pursuing further development of these technologies. Such a reaction would discourage potential businesses from developing such technologies because of the controversy, hostility, and/or potential loss in profits or reputation that could be incurred from pursuing such things. \n\nWhat this boils down to is this - How people respond to the gradual development of increasingly advanced technologies and the integration of those technologies into everyday life will determine the fate of transhumanism as either the start of a new chapter in human history or if it will be rejected and relegated to obscurity.\n\n____________________________________________\n\nWhat do all of you think on these things? In what markets do you think Transhumanism has the potential to receive a lot of attention and develop? What concerns do you have about the future of technology, and what challenges do you think transhumanism will face as we move forward? ",

        "text": "TLDR near the bottom\n\nAnother way of putting this would be: if one were aiming to make progress towards the goal of immortality, should they study a biomedical related field or artificial intelligence?\n\nAt the moment, I see two options for achieving immortality. Immortality will become possible only after we have advanced significantly in many different fields, so the first option is for humanity to make considerable breakthroughs in numerous fields, such as gerontology, epidemiology, and many others.\n\nNote that by achieving immortality I'm talking about achieving it through trans-humanism and overcoming our mortality either by making fundamental changes to our biology, or becoming non-biological altogether. I'm not talking about mind uploading or other theories. Whether or not mind uploading counts as immortality is a topic for a different post (and it's been discussed before).\n\nThe second option would be create a super intelligence. It's safe to assume that once the super intelligence was created, it would take a trivially amount of time for it to make immortality possible in humans. Although, something to note is that there are many many implications and concerns when it comes to the creation of an AI that is more intelligent than us, such as whether we'll have control over it or whether it'll result in a revolution/singularity. Immortality will only be one of a myriad of doorways it opens for us, assuming that it'll be serving us and not the other way around. But that's not what this post is about.\n\nWhat I'm wondering is: which of these two things will happen first? Will humanity make enough progress in the fields of biomedical technology to make immortality possible before we create a super intelligence? Or is it more likely that the AI comes first?\n\nAs far as I know, there are many people working on advancing both biotechnology and AI, but I don't think this question is as simple as which option has more researchers dedicated towards it.\n\n**TLDR** Which will happen sooner:  we are able to achieve immortality (likely as a result of advances in many different fields), or we create a super intelligence?\n\nAll opinions are welcome.",
