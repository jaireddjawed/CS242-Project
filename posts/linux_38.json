I want to now take the external drive and do analysis on the data on my more powerfull (hardware wise) machine that runs windows 10.\n\nWhat are my options? I thought about just downloading the files over the network via ftp from the pi, it's like 250gb worth of data so might be do able, looking for a fairly quick and easy way to get around windows not seeing the drive because of the fs. Alredy tried wsl and some other stuff on windows 10 but no joy and it's kinda a pain just to get the data off. \n\nAny ideas? Cheers",

        "text": "I know this is two questions in one, but I think the two are related. I'm just not sure how. I've been using Linux for a couple decades. While I've done a lot with configuration files, this either covers something at a deeper level than I've used or it's just new material for me.\n\nI've gone through the man page and a few other pages on udevadm and udev rules and I'm still not clear what the KERNEL and KERNELS keywords are specifying when I do an attribute-walk or when used in udev rules files. What I'm trying to learn now is how to specify, in udev rules, how to point to whatever device is plugged into a particular USB port. It looks to me like the KERNEL keyword is part of thi. When I look at the attributes for one USB camera, I get the following attributes under KERNEL or KERNELS:  \n\n\n`KERNEL==\"ttyACM1\"`  \n`KERNELS==\"1-1.1:1.0\"`  \n`KERNELS==\"1-1.1\"`  \n`KERNELS==\"1-1\"`  \n`KERNELS==\"usb1\"`  \n`KERNELS==\"0000:01:00.0\"`  \n`KERNELS==\"0000:00:00.0\"`  \n`KERNELS==\"pci0000:00\"`  \n`KERNELS==\"fd500000.pcie\"`  \n`KERNELS==\"scb\"`  \n`KERNELS==\"platform\"`\n\nI've seen examples, including some questions and answers on Stack Exchange that seem to use something like `KERNELS==\"1-1.1:1.0\"` to specify the physical port, but I'm not sure just what to search for to get a breakdown on what each number means. I've done a number of searches on this, but can't fill in the gaps in my knowledge on it. I do see the `KERNELS==\"usb1\"` attribute, but this is not what I've seen any examples use to specify a particular physical USB port.\n\nHow do I specify to use a device at a specific physical USB port and, along with that, I'd like to know just what the other attributes with the various numbers mean.",

But nobody seems to be talking about the power draw disparity on desktop computers. Between the latest CPU/GPU power requirements and the cost of electricity getting to the point where people are starting to take their power bills into account for the first time, this concern is fresh in my mind. Can anyone confirm whether or not a desktop PC uses more power on Linux than Windows? Like, if you're gaming, does it use more power, or is it only using more power when running at idle or lighter tasks? I'd do it myself but I don't have a desktop. This seems like a pretty important topic nobody is talking about. I understand this is sort of a big ask, especially if you don't dual boot.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/zqls7o/linux_security_secure_computing_mode_seccomp/",
        "text": "“Secure Computing Mode” (seccomp) is a Linux kernel feature that allows restricting system calls that applications can use, by doing that it reduces their attack surface. With seccomp a process can perform a one-way transition to a “secure mode”, in that mode the process can just run the following syscall: read, write, sigreturn and exit. It was merged into the Linux kernel in version 2.6.12 (released in March 2005). \n\nWe can configure seccomp by the libseccomp ([https://github.com/seccomp/libseccomp](https://github.com/seccomp/libseccomp)), the prctl([https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/prctl.2.html](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/prctl.2.html)) system call and/or the seccomp syscall ([https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp.2.html](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp.2.html)) and/or other CLI tools (like [https://github.com/david942j/seccomp-tools](https://github.com/david942j/seccomp-tools)) . \n\nDue to its capabilities seccomp is commonly used in sandboxes like in Docker, LXC, systemd’s sandboxing, kubernetes and even within internet browsers (like  Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox) as an additional layer of security. By that, seccomp can help prevent malicious applications from exploiting vulnerabilities or gaining unauthorized access to resources. Also, it can be used to limit an application’s ability to access the network or access the file system ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seccomp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seccomp)) . \n\nIn the example shown in the screenshot below we can see how we can block a syscall (mkdir) by passing the relevant parameters to docker which uses seccomp (https://miro.medium.com/max/1100/0\\*wz0ilbMy8kr6t30y).\n\nSince kernel 4.14 there is also a “/proc” interface for seccomp  located at “/proc/sys/kernel/seccomp”.  There we can find “actions\\_avail” (a read-only list of seccomp filter return actions supported by the kernel) and “actions\\_logged” (a read-write list of filter actions that are allowed to be logged). For more information about that I suggest reading the following link [https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp.2.html](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp.2.html). Also, since kernel 4.14 we can log actions returned by seccomp in the audit log. \n\n Lastly, there is an extension called “seccomp-bpf” that I am going to detail in the next writeup. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ https:\\/\\/miro.medium.com\\/max\\/1100\\/0\\*wz0ilbMy8kr6t30y ](https://preview.redd.it/qv9g1ebod17a1.png?width=1186&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f4c604db67378e9e65660982f0890cb7dd54f62b)",

        "text": "Hey all,\n\nLast months I've been working on a graphing and data manipulation tool (just a hobby, won't be big and professional like Origin Labs ;-) ).\n\nI've mainly been working on this application because I'm a PhD student in physics, and I've feel like an application like this has been lacking. Either it's convoluted and non-intuitive like SciDaVis or Origin, or you're left to using Python scripting with Matplotlib. The goal of Graphs is to be able to easily import a data file, plot it how you want to, and to do simple operations on it. There's a number of preset operations to use, as well as a custom transformation button, which allows for arbitrary transformations using numpy notation. If I want to take the sine of the X axis, I can just easily till it to apply X = sin(X) on the X coordinates. I can also use the Y coordinates, so Y = Y/X divides each Y value by the corresponding X value in the data file.\n\nAnother neat feature I'd want to highlight is the ability to insert a new data set from an equation with a click from the button. Here too Numpy notation is used (with the exception that is does accept ^ as power operator as well as **, since I felt just ** is too unintuitive. This is also true for the transformation button). The resulting data set gets treated identical to regular data sets and can be saved as text file as well.\n\nI've released Graphs on Flathub last week, and by now I've implemented most of the core functionality. There's still some interesting features planned, and I'm very open to feedback of any kind.\n\nHopefully some of you find it useful. Here's a link to the Flathub page if anyone is interested: [link.](https://flathub.org/apps/details/se.sjoerd.DatMan)",

        "author": "Emotional-Top-200",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/zpyymo/beginner_guide_for_understanding_whonix_vs_tails/",
        "text": "Hey everybody! As a beginner, it is easy to get confused when you hear about Qubes OS, Whonix or Tails. You may ask which one of the three is better? **The answer is, they are made for different use cases and Qubes OS can leverage a Whonix Virtual Machine.**\n\n**Virtual Machine**\n\nFor anybody who doesn’t know, a Virtual Machine is basically another operating system in the one you use as your daily driver. So say you use Windows 10, and you open a program say for example Virtual Box that allows you to have a Linux based operating system inside your Windows installation.\n\nIt is like owning two computers and install on one Windows 10 and on one the Linux based operating system. The benefit of the two computers is they are isolated, and what happens in your computer with the Linux based operating system, stays in there and does not influence your Windows 10 computer. Now a Virtual Machine is a bit more convenient, you can have as much “computers” with as many operating systems as you want on one computer. No, why would you have an isolated operating system? There are security and privacy benefits. The Virtual Machine can be used to open a file, which you suspect is malicious. If it indeed is malicious, only your specific Virtual Machine installation will be compromised, not your main operating system. You can also have a Whonix Virtual Machine, which has the benefit that all network traffic is run through the Tor network, instead of just your Tor Browser on your main operating system. This brings me to the three – Whonix, Tails and Qubes.\n\n**Whonix vs Tails**\n\nWhonix only runs in a Virtual Machine, so you can’t download it and install it as your main operating system. Tails on the other hand is designed for the sole purpose of not leaving any trace on your hard drive, and instead it runs using your RAM. The latter means it is a live operating system, which in turns means every session in Tails will be reset when you visit Tails again. Both Tails and Whonix route pretty much all their traffic through the Tor Network, but Whonix has better defense against a lot more attack vectors (see [https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Comparison\\_with\\_Others](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Comparison_with_Others)), in that regard it might be better for you, if that is what you seek. On the other hand, you could have a USB with Tails OS and plug it into a computer and do your stuff, and then turn off the computer and take the USB out and leave without a trace. Thus, Whonix and Tails are made for different use cases, albeit both run through the Tor Network.\n\n**Qubes OS**\n\nQubes OS is Xen-hypervisor and can be used as your main operating system. The thinking about Qubes is as follows - the guys at Qubes realized that no matter how secure of an operating system you try to make, it is always easier to attack and find weaknesses in the system, than it is to defend it. A single mistake can compromise the entire operating system. So they let you run everything, from a Wi-Fi, USB and application in different virtual machines. Your virtual machine where you only browse the internet gets compromised? It doesn’t affect any other virtual machine. The Virtual Machines you have in Qubes can be Windows, or various Linux distribution, such as Whonix for increased privacy. Qubes divides all your things in compartments and isolates them from each other (check Qubes if you want to know how they do it, while still allowing you to maintain usability of the system for the user).\n\n**In conclusion**, if I was a complete beginner I would start messing with Whonix and other Linux distributions to get the feel of it, and I would be cautious to immediately jump to Qubes OS (it is far from beginner-friendly). Qubes OS also needs like 16 GB (it is pretty much a collection of different operating systems), so not everybody can install it.",
