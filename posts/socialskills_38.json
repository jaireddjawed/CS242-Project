        "text": "Hi guys, I've questions regarding friendship. So ya I feel quite overwhelmed recently due to friendship issue. There's this one guy I don't like in my class, as he often said something disrespectful towards me or made bad things up about me. I really don't like how he always make things up and tells others about it, and said in a tone that made most of them believe it's true, and it's difficult for me to explain or clarify. And from what I heard, he did the same things to other friends closer to him as well behind their back, which further strengthen my thought that he's not a good friend to hang out with. Plus, he always talks in a way to prove that he's above others and wants to make others think he's very capable. So, I try to avoid talking to him and set up the boundaries as it affects my emotions. \n\nHowever, I've other friends in class who I consider as my good friends are also mutual friends with him. Since I don't want to hang out with that guy anymore, so I'll normally leave the group if he's joining any conversation or outing. And recently I notice that after he realized I establish distance with him, he started to do the same thing as well (which is not wrong imo). But he'll always try to make plans with our mutual friends ahead so I don't have chance to hang out with them anymore since he is there. And I'm not sure why I notice our mutual friends also not talking to me much lately.. And I can feel the awkwardness between me and those mutual friends as I still need to see them everyday in classes, but we are not close anymore, and it's only me being alone.\n\nThis semester is full of academic stress, and losing my friends in class definitely adds additional stress to me. I feel kinda alone. Even though deep down inside me, I know I've made a right decision to have the boundaries set up, but at the same time I'm losing other mutual friends as support. Finding new friends are hard since most of the people already have their own group of friends and it's difficult for me to join in.\n\nAt one point, I started to think whether it's my problems that good friends left me at the end. But my besties (we've known each other since high school) reassure me that I'm a very thoughtful and nice friends, so it's not my fault. But I've not much close friends in college and I'm far away from my family, plus I believe most people have some kind of trust issues so it's difficult for us to bond more. I tried joining some clubs before, but it's difficult to join in since they all know each other for a long time. I cry a lot lately due to the rejections I face from those friends mentioned above, and I started doubting myself every now and then. It's tough to force myself to think positively when I need to face them everyday in classes. My negative mind just can't stop reminding myself that I'm friendless and I'm unable to find good friends again.\n\nJust wondering if anyone has faced this issue before? And may I know how you deal with it?",

        "text": "Dear friends, \n\nI’ve been dealing with a rather tricky problem at work recently and I would be happy to receive some input on how to handle it.\n\nBackstory:\n\nA while ago, I started a new job in a medium-sized non-profit company (about 800 employees), which prides itself for its inclusiveness and tolerance. Work has been great and I feel very comfortable there.\n\nThere is one guy, let’s call him Alex. During my first weeks, he appeared in front of me during a company event and informed me that I had missed his presentation that morning. That was the first time I met him, I had no idea who he was or what presentation he was talking about.\n\nTurned out he is an employee of another unit in the same department as mine. His unit processes some of my unit‘s paperwork, but in my role, I don’t really have anything to do with him.\n\nEvery other day, Alex stops by my office for the usual office small talk. I’m usually happy to chat, but since we don’t work together, there isn’t overly much to say. Every single time, Alex seems to miss the right moment to leave. I’ll say thing like ‘Alright, I better get back into my stuff’ and turn to my screen slowly, but Alex will still keep standing and looking at me like he expects me to keep talking. It’s a nuisance for me, but not too bad.\n\nThe interactions with Alex made me think that maybe he has some autistic traits. It seems like he doesn’t really understand basic social interactions very well.\n\nThe real problem:\n\nThere is another coworker, let’s call her Kim. We’re work friends and she recently came to me twice to vent about Alex’s behavior. Alex and Kim work directly together on some projects.\n\nThe first incident was that Alex brought her a plate of cookies. It’s very common in our office to bring cookies of cake for everyone, but an individual plate for someone is weird by our standards. \n\nAlex asked Kim if she liked the cookies, to which she politely said she did. This prompted Alex to say that he will bring cookies to Kim regularly now. Kim responded that she appreciates the kindness but that she would gain a lot of weight and doesn’t wanna eat so many cookies. I’m turn, Alex said that Kim has a great body and doesn’t need to worry about her weight. This comment crossed a line for Kim and she felt very uncomfortable.\n\nThe following weeks, Alex kept sending Kim appointments in Outlook to discuss work-related stuff that was really not necessary at all. It seemed like he wanted to find reasons to spend more time with Kim.\n\nLast week then, there was another such meeting. Kim told me that Alex was waiting for her in his office with two champagne glasses filled with water to ‘toast to the great performance of last year’. Kim just chugged down the water and left Alex’s office without saying anything.\n\nSince then, she feels very uncomfortable at work. She says she’ll always be wary of being in the shared kitchen and even in the hallway because she does not wanna see Alex. Obviously, ihr office is not an acceptable working environment for Kim right now. \n\n——————\n\nKim and I have been talking about this a bit and we struggle to find a solution. Obviously Alex has some issues with social interactions. We both care about inclusiveness at our workplace and know that Alex only means well. However, this is not an acceptable situation for Kim either. We thought about talking to our manager, but also don’t want Alex to get into any trouble.\n\nHow would you handle this situation?",

E.g. last year I was scared to ask them to let me buy a PC (with my own money) and when I did build up the courage to ask they let me. I currently am thinking about starting a YouTube channel (learning things, a bit like Mike Boyd) because I think it would be a fun and productive way to fill my time and you can even possibly make some money. I want to let them know because I want to be transparent with them; I dont want to hide it and try record videos only when they're out. However, whenever I start thinking about asking them I suddenly get really nervous and decide against it. I have a good relationship with my parents, I'm not a bad kid and I revise get good grades etc. I know this fear is irrational but I just dont know what to do. I am also an extroverted, confident person in real life so I dont know why this happens, maybe I'm afraid they will say no because they didn't used to let me do things on the internet like talk to strangers or play shooting games. Any advice?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; I don't know why I get nervous when asking for certain things from my parents and get too scared to ask.",

They kept whispering to the capt, and she proceeded to scold us. I admit I wasn’t at my best but the two weren’t any better. They have no right to do so. I don’t want to be friends with them but there’s very few ppl in the team and they’re very likely to stay. Not to mention they can actually play. We get along fine usually but I can see that I’m not their friend. And it’s not only me, the others feel it too. The three of them tgt are sometimes insufferable. Somehow they think they’re superior. They’re my teammates however and we have a lots of matches ahead. Should I just be the bigger man and let it go? \n\n\n\np.s.I’m a bit of an introvert but I do have friends.

To say the least, I always feel like I am in his space or annoying him. He barely sits in the same room I am in. The only communication is “Hi” and if it t is something about the house. All my previous roommates are now somewhat friends and we always hung out and got close. But with him, I can’t seem to do that. \n\nI want to clarify that I wasn’t expecting to be close friends with him, but at least do some activities together to make it “less awkward” living together like cooking together once a week or something. Right now, he is playing video games in the living room and I am sitting in utter silence which as an extrovert, is driving me crazy a bit lol.\n\nHence, my question is, how can I make sure I don’t become too suffocating to him, but also find common ground between us?",

I still want to be close just the 3 of us. If my 2 friends want to be friends with the other girls, sure they can, but I just dont want ALL of us to hang out together. I want small separate groups . If my 2 friends want to hang out with the 2 girls, then they can hang out without me. And if they want to hang out with me, then they can hang out with me without the 2 girls. If the 2 girls want to get to know me, i'm willing to entertain them to chat over coffee without my other 2 friends.\n\nMy feelings are kinda confusing rn. Hope it made sense.",

I am respectful to everyone and maintain my own sense of individualism while not treading on others opinions and feelings. I try to join in on work conversations at the right times with self-awareness and not take over the conversation, but just contribute to the cycle, or help push it further. I've been told all my life I'm extremely good-looking and tall. I laugh, I smile, I compliment others appropriately. I have my own interests, and knowledge I can talk about and I ask others, when reasonable, about theirs. I also find things in common with me and others and try to spark a moment of bonding over it (again, within reason and not forced. Just putting as much or as little effort as feels appropriate given the feeling of the moment.) \n\nBut it feels like people treat me as if they covertly believe they're above me while being nice, just entertaining me for a second for the sake of it, or sometimes are willing to possibly ignore me and play it off hoping I'll think they might not have heard. One girl I work with is COMPLETELY disinterested in me. I don't mean romantically. I mean she has literally zero interest in my existence and it's like I'm a ghost she knows how to talk to, but it also like \"ooh, a ghost, whatever\". Our interactions can be summed up with \"-\\_-\". Keep in mind, I don't force conversations or interactions with her, I haven't flirted with her, I haven't been rude to her or bragged, or done ANYTHING BAD to her or around her. But her patience with me seems to be limited. \n\nIt's like I either give it my all, just to be treated mediocrely, or occasionally give in to negativity and be openly disliked. I am perfectly capable and willing to accept when I'm doing something wrong, but this whole thing has me in a twist.  I feel physically and mentally uncomfortable and unsettled a lot of the time, but I don't portray this to others, at least not on purpose.",

Since day 1 when I was introduced to everyone, everyone was friendly n said hello at least but this 1 girl was straight staring daggers at me. I'll say good morning n no response lol. I was new n my work was slower getting done, literally I hear the girl \"omg he's still doing it\" n another coworker was saying \"well to b fair hes still training\" (defending me). The group has a group message at work set up. I was added into the group chat...then the girl removed me from the group chat lol. Everytime she c me I always c her mentally rolling her eyes. Honestly I get alone with everyone at work great, but man this girl has it out for me n I honestly cant think of what I did. I swap shifts with another coworker, n when I came in she said \"thats a nice surprise didnt expect u\". Still say good morning n good bye, then just dont interact with her unless professionally require? I dont want to cause drama, only want to get bills pay. To top it off they had n escape room plan, I could hear other coworkers saying send out a mass email to include everyone n I could c her begrudgingly do it. \n\nOn another note, everyone was on vacation leaving just her n me in the office n she went to talk to another employee saying \"Im gonna cry\" as if being stuck with me...n another time when she say me at my desk just when she was walking in I could hear her say \"sh\\*t\". I mean Im not being paranoid right?",

        "text": "It probably sounds stupid because I’m two weeks away from 23. I was bullied in high school and never got invited to any real parties (I used to go to/organise picnics in the park for drama club but that was it). I moved to a different country for college and about 3 months into it my last friendships from back home blew up. I have never held a consistent friendship for more than 3 years (my longest running friendship is with my friend I met in early 2019). I went to clubs maybe 4 or 5 times in 2019/early 2020 and was kind of learning to socialise. Then the pandemic hit and I didn’t really socialise at all until a few months ago. I completed most of my degree online and now work for a 100% remote tech start up. I live in my city’s entertainment district but I’ve only been out a handful of times for things that weren’t a sit down dinner with my partner. \n\nMy partner has a lot of friends and is in contact with people he knew in high school regularly. One of his friends invited us to her birthday party for which she rented a venue and invited 15 other people. I knew 1 of the girls there from game nights my partner has hosted for his friends but I really struggled to make conversation. Some people were dancing but I felt too clunky and too exposed to try dance. My partner recommended drinking but I’m currently in the process of losing weight so I don’t drink anymore or eat any party snacks. I had one drink but I saw the calorie count and couldn’t justify continuing to drink. In the end I found a chair in the corner and sat on the sidelines feeling more and more like I’m broken and I won’t ever be able to connect with people and have fun. Eventually I left my partner there and walked back home alone. \n\nI tried bumble bff when we moved to the city but never really made it past two meet ups and following each other on sns. I feel like at this point I’m entirely hopeless. My birthday is in 2 weeks and I never had a big 21st birthday because of the lockdowns and I was thinking of doing something this year but I simply wouldn’t have anyone to invite except my best friend and her boyfriend. It’s sad to be this young and stuck having to live like I’m an old woman.",

But I am not socializing in that time frame of paranoid thinking, and thus i am removed from the conversation and isolated into my own thoughts. it feels like a positive feedback loop where internal thoughts get louder and louder even though i don’t want them to.\n\nAs for delusional. My thoughts are so loud and so rational to my own head that I am convinced  they are correct. But that other voice in me is saying, whoa, hold on, all of this that you’re thinking about your social skills aren’t real. You actually have good social skills, you’re thinking is just wrong, i.e paranoid. There’s nothing wrong with your actions, you don’t have to grade them.\n\nThen i go back to wondering why i’m alone and i have no friends to hang with on friday night and im back to believing my thoughts, that i do need some work in the social department.",

        "text": "I feel like I put more significance into interactions and feel closer to people than they do to me. An example is a tutor at the school I work out. We worked together on assessments for a period of time. I thought over those few days we got along really well and I developed a bit of a friend crush on her (we’re both women, and talk about all sorts of unrelated-to-work stuff). One day she just didn’t show up to the usual place we meet to prepare the assessments. Later I found out she just decided to go back to tutoring for a bit and save assessments until later….but she didn’t let me know. So I kept checking that room throughout the day to see if she was there. Then a few hours later she approached me later and asked if I would help her with assessments, like everything was normal.  I was surprised she didn’t let me know about changing her mind….like the fact that she usually met me at that time was something she didn’t remember. Another example is this guy in my class I used to sit next to every day for a semester. I thought we had grown somewhat close as class friends. We spoke about some personal subjects. But this semester he has chosen to sit on the other side of the room and not sit next to me. Occasionally he will come over and sit next to me again and he still talks to me and acts super friendly a lot of the time, so he doesn’t seem to have a problem with me. \n\nThere are other examples like this. It’s embarrassing that I get up in my feelings about such tiny things but I guess it makes me feel kind of pathetic, like I am interested in keeping a consistency in the relationship they have no desire to keep. I think I process these as mini-rejections in a way. I know I should just chill and accept these are just casual relationships and I am not close to these people, but I guess I get attached too quickly or something? Maybe I have a clingy personality I need to work on? I don’t know if others feel this way.",

        "text": "Hello! Sorry if this seems like a pity party. I am a female under 18. My whole life, I have been struggling with making friends and had terrible anxiety about it, even as a little kid. When I was in elementary school, I didn't have any friends. Sure, there were a few kids I talked to occasionally but I would never call any of them friends. I did have a best friend growing up but honestly, I don't know how we were. We had very little in common &amp; would always get into arguments over the stupidest things. Yet somehow, we remained friends until the end of middle school.\n\nAfter I went to high school, I've been making a huge effort to get over my social anxiety &amp; branch out. It's been amazing! I've been making a lot of progress and even started my own club at school. I make an effort to sit next to new people &amp; strike up a conversation but there's something just wrong with me. I don't know what it is. I see others instantly click all around me, but despite trying &amp; being persistent, I can never form any relationships with others my age.\n\nI don't understand. Is there something I'm doing wrong? I don't think I act inappropriately or strangely around others &amp; I have never been told I do so either. I work well with others &amp; have a lot come to me for help with academic things. I used to think I just couldn't click with anyone my age because I don't understand their jokes or have much in common with anyone as I'm so busy working after school that I don't have much time for hobbies or anything anymore. Despite my efforts, I still feel so isolated from everyone. There are some people that initiate conversations with me occasionally &amp; we always have a nice chat but we always remain acquaintances only.\n\nI recently stopped going to therapy since my therapist believed I didn't need it as we never have anything to talk about in sessions anymore. We have worked on this for about a year now and have definitely made a lot of progress. I don't believe that I'm worthless without having friends or feel so afraid of talking to others anymore. However, even though I kind of accepted it that this is how it is, I still always wondered. I know some people have a really hard time making friends, but I almost feel like there is something in the way. Some kind of unknown glass wall making it so hard. I don't know what it is though &amp; it frustrates me. \n\nAgain, sorry for the pity party. I just wanted to see if I can get some advice. Thank you",

It wasn’t objective advice either, it was really just a preference. Why would I follow his preference when it was something I cooked for myself? It felt like when people give unsolicited advice about clothing choices. \n\nIf I wanted to be mean I would say something along the lines of “I didn’t ask what you would do” next time this happens, but he’s a very close friend and I like him a lot so I want this to be productive.. I just can’t think of how to say this in a non snarky way or a way that makes it seem like I only want him to say good things about my cooking. This is definitely a smaller issue but I’d appreciate some help! Thanks in advance :)",

It's currently Friday night and I'm eating a sandwich on the couch and browsing the Internet. \n\nI'm not going to lie, I love being alone. Being around people takes so much energy. Yet there's a part of me that craves social connection. I know deep down it's good for me. \n\nSo for a couple years I've known I need to start making some changes and getting out more. At least on the weekend nights. I feel a bit stuck as to making this happen. Part of it is lack of motivation. Part of it is not knowing if I should. Part of it is just not knowing who to hangout with. \n\nIf anyone wants to start a small group chat, it would be cool to encourage each other and offer advice. Sometimes talking about issues you feel stuck with can help. If you're interested PM me",

After years of abusing myself I learned about self-improvement. I started going to the gym again, made many attempts to quit weed for good, be more positive in life, etc. I outgrew a lot of people and it’s been a little lonely. Some people I had to cut off because they didn’t know how to set boundaries with my time. I started cutting people off when my best friend developed psychosis. Long story, but I realized I can’t really help people who don’t want to be helped. He was out of state and no one knew he was going crazy. I think I’ve matured a lot during this time but I still have a longing for connection. I got no one to talk to besides my parents. I keep thinking what if I meet a girl and she thinks I’m weird for not having friends. Anyways thanks for reading",

I saw notifications next to my friend, who I also befriended, that were saying things like ‘Do I know him’, ‘I dont even want to accept his friend request’. My first showed me the messages. At first I laughed at it, so I sent her a message ‘you disappoint me’. She said ‘??’ ‘What’. Turns out she was serious. I never expected someone to be so rude and sick minded in my life. I also don’t want to be rude, but realistically she isn’t beautiful and I think that attention made her feel a beauty. I only wanted to make friends, 0.000001% interested in her romantically. At least I have some attention with beautiful girls in my uni because of my looks. Now in my country, I never partied nor danced. I felt so lonely so I decided to go to a party and dance even if I was questioning myself if I am myself or not. I am feeling sick and I don’t think foreigners will ever feel alone in a place like France, especially if he is the only one in the class. Now there was an Erasmus guy who is Italian, we connected really quickly and that’s how I knew that maybe the problem isn’t totally from me but from the people there. I’m sorry but I didn’t know where else to express myself, I’m feeling really sick because I was planning to stay for the next 3 years, and now I feel forced and not enjoying. I always tell myself it is my fault. I would like to hear your opinion and advice please. Thanks",

I really love talking to people, gossiping, making new friends, etc. However, I HATE hanging out with them outside of forced environments( i.e work, school, events). No matter how much I like the person or event we’re going to, I always would prefer being home. I want to go, but I also don’t.\n\nIs this okay? I feel different about it because my family/friends thinks I leave them out intentionally.. that’s just not the case.",

        "text": "There’s no way this is normal. If I’m at a social gathering, no one will be interested in talking to me. I know the easy response is, “just talk to them,” although people don’t want you to approach them when they avoid eye contact with you. I’m well aware of when I am unwelcome, and have found out the hard way many times.\n\nI’m literally just talking about friendships, and starting normal interactions with new people. At gatherings and parties, even shy people aren’t that invisible, someone eventually comes up to them, but never me. \n\nThis is all appearance based as I never even get the chance to talk to people most of the time. I’m nothing to look at but I don’t think I’m THAT repulsive to have everyone avoid you. I just don’t know what could possibly be so off-putting. \n\nIm I’m good shape, my clothes fit well, I don’t see why I have any trouble. For me it’s like I have a 1 in 1 million chance of even being able to interact with someone who actually also wants to talk to me. How can I practice my social skills when everyone pretends you’re not there? What about me could possibly convey that I have nothing to offer.",

We sometimes spend hours texting (our work allows us to text while working) and that's all fine and dandy but he never reaches out to me outside work for some reason. \n\nWe hanged out during the weekend only because I suggested it but he never reaches out to me to hang out outside work. Why would he be super interested to talk to me while at work but once we finish work I'm a nobody. This sort of behaviour just baffles me.\n\nPS. There is nothing romantic between us I just consider him as a really good friend.",
