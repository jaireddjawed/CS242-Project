However, I've noticed that sometimes I tend to forget some vocabulary and verbs even though I've seen it with my tutor, so it limits my conversation. \n\nMy question is : what is the best way to learn Kiswahili considering the factors above ? Should I do more reading/listening/practice? And how?\n\nAsanteni sana!",

It is an extremely difficult language to learn, let alone master for foreigners, so I am glad I possess a skill that most people in the world would probably be never able to obtain. Of course, I've been surrounded by Polish since conception, so it is not really any kind of amazing intellectual achievement, but still.\n\nHowever. Polish is not a particularly important or relevant language worldwide. Aside from Poland and its neighbouring countries, it is pretty much irrelevant. It is not taught in schools or universities, it is not a working language of any major internations organizations (like the UN or the UE), is it not an official language anywhere outside of Poland, and so on.\n\nLike, I love Polish, but I kind of wish my native language was a little bit more relevant.\n\nSay, if you are a Mandarin Chinese native speaker, and you move to the USA, you could always use that to you advantage and maybe even get a job. There is surely a lot of demand for fluent Mandarin speakers. Even if you never set your foot in China, being a native speaker of Mandarin is an EXTREMELY useful skill.\n\nNow, by comparison, were I to do the same and move to the USA, literally nobody would care about me being a native speaker of Polish. Meanwhile, I would always be an inferior English speaker compared to native speakers.\n\nI hope you understand what I mean. I envy native speaker of Spanish, Chinese, French or English, as those are languages that are actually somewhat relevant and people respect them. I think that natives of those languages do not appreciate their gift enough.\n\nThoughts?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/105xgmm/my_new_years_goal_to_achieve_b2_proficiency_or/",
        "text": "Hey all, long-time lurker of the subreddit. I have made my plan to learn Spanish by the end of the year and actually be able to use it and set myself up for success. I work at a high school as a Government teacher, but I am next door to 3 of our language arts teachers and they all agree my plan is a really good one for any language, so I wanted to share with you all what I am doing this year and maybe help give someone direction if someone needs help on how to study or at what pace. \n\n**DISCLAIMER**: I am attempting to learn Spanish, but you could use any language for this study guide. Some might fit better than others. For example, Japanese might need extra work so that you could figure out strokes for Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji. I, however, don't need those. Thus, feel free to add or subtract whatever you would like from my study methods. \n\n**MY BACKGROUND:** I speak no Spanish. I have studied Hebrew and Greek a bit, but that's all. I have completed 16/211 units on Duolingo last year, but that's the most I have ever done. Anyways, on to the study guide. \n\n# Methodology\n\nMy methodology is 3 fold: \n\n* Vocabulary\n* Speaking\n* Listening\n\nWhile I understand learning a new language can develop all 3 simultaneously depending on what curriculum you are using, I believe that certain curricula favor one or two of these 3 skills over the other one or two. Thus, If I focus on each one individually, consistently, and equally, I could get the results I want. \n\nHere is how I am studying via all 3:\n\n# Vocabulary\n\nFor vocabulary, I am using Duolingo. While I understand Duolingo might not be the best in terms of getting people to be comfortable in language conversations, it DOES help with word recognition and context recognition. Sometimes I listen to audio in Spanish and I am amazed that I could pick up a few words. Duolingo's gamelike feature for learning languages is second to none when it comes to attractiveness and making the learning process seamless. Again, this is just for vocab though. While it does have listening and speaking activities and lessons, they pale in comparison to other apps and curricula. I want to have all 211 Units of Duolingo finished by December 31st. \n\nAlso, Duolingo has an adoption program in its Deluxe edition of the app and curriculum. It costs $7 a month, but you can get into a family plan for free through adoption. It has an entire board for people looking to adopt strangers for free. Don't let money deter you from language freedom. \n\n# Speaking\n\nFor speaking, I am using Pimsleur every day. Pimsleur has Spanish in 5 levels, with each level having 30 audio lessons to complete. Again, just like Duolingo, Pimsleur has reading lessons to be completed after every audio lesson. However, the bread and butter for Pimsleur are its audio lessons. It forces you to listen to a Spanish conversation and then say each word in the conversation slowly but ensuring the quality of speech. Also, at the end of every lesson, it throws you in as one of the characters of the conversation and gives you an opportunity to show yourself everything you learned in that lesson. You will speak throughout the entire lesson, and that's certainly very helpful. I have spoken more Spanish on Pimsleur than I have on Duolingo, and I am just getting started on Pimsleur. I want to complete all 5 levels of Pimsleur by December 31st. \n\nPimsleur is $20 a month. No sugar coating it, I'm gonna have to bite the bullet on this one. But, I think the lessons are worth it. **Also, if I do a lesson a day, I can finish all lessons by the start of June.** \n\n# Listening \n\nSo I would argue that using both Duolingo and Pimsleur does give you a gracious amount of language listening. In fact, the Spanish teacher at my school told me that learning Spanish to understand students and people in my community was doable with just these two sources. However, it is also important to listen to native speakers and tune my ears to the way they speak Spanish as well. Thus, I will watch 5 movies that were filmed with Spanish dialogue. It is important that it is not an English movie with Spanish dubbed over it, but that the actors and actresses actually speak Spanish so I can see lips move and become familiar with the way they carry themselves within the Spanish language. This will help me work on my pronunciation and perfect the accent I am aiming to receive (I'd prefer to have a Mexican accent, as I live in a state that is close to Mexico). Hopefully, by December, I can have watched over 100 movies in Spanish. \n\n# Updates\n\nThroughout the year, I will give updates on my progress and how I am doing. My goal is to read and write one day on almost the same par as a native speaker. I believe I can do it, but it starts with determination for me! Good luck to everyone with their language-learning process!",

So I would be learning these languages just for the sake of it. It‚Äôs hard to get the motivation and if I ever do get decent I feel like down the road I would end up abandoning the languages therefore making it a huge waste of time.\n\nI personally don‚Äôt even have a particular interest in the countries that speak the Romance languages I just enjoy the idea of one day being fluent in all of them. I think Russian or Japanese would be cooler and more fun but they seem way too hard and even more impractical.",

Now, I'm spending the next 6 months in Paris. Do you have some tips for me? When I'm learning french (vocab or grammar) I always try to think of the Spanish counterpart. Maybe you know some comparative learning materials? I would be interested in a vocabulary trainer which allows learing multiple language at the same time if that exists. Also a comparative grammar guide would be cool. Of course I will try to speak as much as possible here but I will also take some time for just learning by myself.\n\nThanks in advance and greetings from Paris!\nNiklas",

When people talk to me in Dutch it's like too fast and my brain can't catch up - if I saw the same words written on paper I would be able to understand, but when it's only listening, it's like gibberish and I can only catch a few basic words. It's really discouraging and causes me to start conversation in English (which most people here speak easily). But it's very important to me to get more comfortable conversing, for my career and social life. Happy to hear any advice if you've been in a similar situation!",

Someone told me Portuguese sounds like a drunk Russian trying to speak Spanish and until three weeks ago, it sounded spot on.\n\nThen out of curiosity I started Brazilian Portuguese on Duolingo. I only got a 12 days streak before getting bored and giving up, thinking I'd never learn Portuguese.\n\nI did realize a few things though.\n\nThough Portuguese shares more vocabulary with Italian and Spanish than I expected when listening to it, the more common a word the further apart they seem. \n\nCommon verbs like *olhar* (to look at), *brincar* (to joke), morar (to live), achar (to think), esquecer (to forget) or escolher (to choose) have little to nothing in common with Italian and Spanish and have to be learned from zero. I downloaded a list, had a look and that was it. I didn't feel I had the time or mental fortitude to try and learn Portuguese as relatively easy as it might be.\n\nA few days ago though, I was about to download an audiobook on audible and realized they had it in Portuguese too. I figured I might as well give it a try. \n\nAnd yeah, I guess I know Portuguese. \n\nFor the first half of the book I absolutely needed the ebook to read what the narrator was saying as the accent sounded like complete gibberish. But I guess I got used to it quickly because I've just been listening it to it without the text and I understand it just fine. \n\nEvery now and then I have to look for a word or an expression that causes me to not understand the sentence but that happens for English too and I have at least a C1.\n\nHas it ever happened to you? Just skipping the actual studying part and learning with books and shows? Which language was it?\n\nI'm honestly over the moon. Over the next six months I'll try reading/listening to a few books and watching movies and then I'll try taking a test. We'll see how it goes.",

They've told me that many tutors from the US (also based there) charge $18-25 an hour, but they consider it a bit pricey. Therefore, they've been trying to hire tutors South American tutors that are based in Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, etc but speak both English/Spanish and seem to charge less. Apparently, South American tutors charge from $10-15 an hour for an online lesson, which seems pretty reasonable, but my friends are still trying to negotiate those rates. I've told them that there are way cheaper options in websites where they can find tutors from all over the world, but they say many of them are \"too cheap and probably they're not as good at teaching\" (smh). \n\nUltimately, I've told them to just use duolingo or pay $300 for one of those pre-recorded courses if they don't want to spend too much money on language learning. Or just to learn like I did: on my own and 100% free but with a lot of struggles. \n\nHave you had to deal with people like these? How much would you say it's a reasonable rate for an hour of English lessons?",

        "text": "I was talking to a multilingual friend, and I asked her if she ever experienced what I call the \"gibberish problem\" when learning a new language. Simply put, my brain often shuts down when it hears someone speaking in my target language, even if I know every word and grammar point. My brain decides, \"this is gibberish, so I'll just ignore it.\" I have yet to find a method to convince my brain that, no, this is actual information that someone is trying to pass on to me.\n\nMy friend said she didn't know what I was talking about, which led me to wonder if this is an issue that's unique to me. I've been studying my target language for about five years now, and no amount of immersion or comprehensible input seems to shake me out of it. And yes, I know it's common among language learners to ask the question, \"is there something wrong with me?,\" and just as common for polyglots to tell them, \"no, what you're experiencing is normal. Stop trying to be special and just keep at it.\"\n\nSo, is anybody else experiencing this, or does anyone have any suggestions to get past it?",

Now however I find myself understanding what people say to me here okay, but I suddenly feel incapable to string a sentence together of more than one clauseüò≠I just wondered if it is really just so much harder putting language skills in practise in the culture for everyone, or I just have some serious confidence issuesüòÇ",

I learnt french in school and consider myself alright at it, enough to read and write but I definitely didn't get much speaking and listening practice so I can't say fluent at all which is something I definitely want to be good at in the next one I learn. \n\nI like textbook exercises and such as a way to learn, and I have tried Duolingo a few times with some different ones to have a quick look but feel it doesn't help give the foundations for learning.\n\nI've heard good things about memrise and with their current half-price offer, I'm tempted but don't know if it's worth it.\n\nI'm considering dutch, maybe German? but using Duolingo have found I gravitate to dutch easier so I'm planning that one first unless any advice says otherwise.\n\nAnyway, I was hoping for site learning recommendations or textbooks. Potentially any google chrome extensions for Netflix and such will help my immersion.\n\nThis is my first post here and I know its a lot but I'm really interested in learning! Thank you in advance!",

        "text": "I recently got an internship which will be entirely in German, starting in about a month, and I am not sure whether or not to also enroll in evening German classes at the local university. My level is about B2/C1, and I can get by but I often make mistakes and find I speak pretty basically most of the time. \n\nIt's really a priority of mine to get to a good smooth conversational level, and I'm afraid if I don't have some sort of structured class forcing me speak in a more accurate and complex way, I might fall into speaking habits that let me get my point across but are pretty basic or even mistaken. But on the other hand, it's 40 hours a week of basically immersion, maybe the constant exposure will help me improve more than a class can.\n\nI would just wait and see for a month or two of my internship, but the only suitable class in the city starts around the same time my internship, and follows school semesters so wouldn't start up again until next Fall, and I don't want to miss my chance if this is something that would genuinely help me improve more quickly.",
