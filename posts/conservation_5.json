We've made the decision not to return to any SeaWorld so long as they have whales in captivity for human entertainment, but I'm wondering if Shedd is different? I see on their website that they still have whales as well, but there's information on trying to restore belugas to the wild so I'm wondering if it's more like a zoo situation where they have animals in captivity but are trying to increase the wild population, or if the whales are mostly just there for shows. We don't want to knowingly support any place that stresses and mistreats their animals, and we don't want our son growing up thinking it's OK to have places like that. Just want to do due diligence before going. Thanks!",

        "text": "I graduated from university with a conservation degree in mid 21 and since then have been volunteering long term in a number of sites in the UK, living on nature reserves. I recently accepted a 6 month internship with the RSPB where I will get training in heathland ecology and maintenance as well other qualifications, such as brush cutter, chainsaws, felling etc. However, I have also been offered the option of choosing some additional training that would ideally benefit the reserves and I‚Äôm struggling on what to chose.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRight now, my aim over the next few years is to find my first paid position as a warden or ranger in the remotest parts of the country, ideally highland Scotland, while I organise European citizenship for myself. Eventually, I‚Äôd like to move to France and work in high mountain ecology, in habitats where there are large terrestrial predators. With that in mind the options I‚Äôve come up with are as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Pine forest ecology, maintenance and plantation regeneration. Luckily our sites are old plantations, however they are being converted to heathland, and not back to pristine forests.   \n\n\n\\- Conservation grazing. I know a fair bit about this already, having worked with my brother who is a shepherd in the Pyrenees, along with having worked in sites with free roaming sheep. The site I‚Äôm on also has some ponies and seasonal longhorns, so it would be beneficial to them.   \n\n\n\\-Peatland and marsh ecology. Peatland being one of the areas of chief concern in Scotland would make this option more beneficial short term, however I‚Äôm not sure how useful it would be to the reserve. While certainly marshy in parts, there are no peat lands.   \n\n\n\\- Soil ecology. Generally transferable and a topic I find quite interesting, this could be useful as a whole, however I wonder how applicable it is in everyday life.   \n\n\nAny and all advice would be very welcome.",

        "text": "I had just realized that many have been misinformed about the asiatic cheetah as many articles have fallen into the woozle effect of getting misinformation. A example of this was that article that said the asiatic cheetah had only 12 left in which all other news websites started copying that article not knowing that original article made a error as the 12 were actually in captivity and did not represent the actual wild population. According to Tehran times which is the only other source that gets info from the asiatic cheetahs directly have stated 48 recorded exist and within those 48 are 30 adults with rest as subadults. There is of course the two 1 month cubs found and put into captivity to hopefully have them grow as adults and release into the wild. I just want to point this out as misinformation like this can hinder conservation and bypass certain conservation actions that should happen. I know Iran isn't in a great situation for asiatic cheetah conservation(iranian protests still going and might get bloodier in the future.) but it is not to give up the asiatic cheetah and continue to help this species in hope to have them be in their former ranges once more.",

Everyone is welcome, even if you‚Äôre just curious about it. \n\nI‚Äôm hoping to join one myself this summer and use the opportunity as a stepping stone into the conservation/environmental field. My current job is in tech but I‚Äôm ready for a change, even if it‚Äôs more physically challenging and with slightly less pay. I actually did a lot of environmental work as an AmeriCorps NCCC member servers years ago but life took me in a different direction and away from nature.\n\nAnyway, hope to see some of you on the other end!",
