        "text": "Stolen from a FB post:\n\nBeto is that dude who’s dating your ex-girlfriend who you hate so you get drunk and decide to vandalize his car because you know you can’t really compete with him in any category. Then when you pull up he’s in the front yard teaching your ex’s nephew how to throw a spiral and this kinda hurts because the kid never even talked to you at family functions so you lose your nerve and go to walk away but Beto sees you and sees the pillowcase full of spray paint cans you brought with you to spray paint “gay” on his Dodge Charger and he’s like “Ted?” (Because you’re Ted Cruz in this scenario)\n\nAnd you’re like “Oh hey Beto... I was just.... I had to... I was gonna paint a...wall....nearby.”\n\nAnd he starts to put it together in his head what’s happening so he tells your girls nephew to go inside and do 20 push-ups to get his throwing arm big and strong and then he high fives the kid and the kid runs inside without even saying hi to you. \n\nSo you’re like “What’s up man?”\n\nAnd he walks up and shakes your hand and pulls you in for a bro-hug and then looks you in the eyes and sincerely asks you how you’re doing. \n\nIt takes you a few seconds to answer becasue nobody has asked you that since the break-up. Your friends haven’t even asked you that. You try to give a fake platonic answer and for some reason you get this lump in your throat. You can’t force any words out and before you know it you’re crying for the first time in years and Beto brings you in for another hug and locks it in, holding you close while you sob uncontrollably.\n\n“I was gonna spray paint ‘gay’ on your car because... I hate you so bad for taking her from me.... but I’ll never hate you.... as much.... as I hate myself”\n\nWhen you say that last part the waterworks really kick in. You’re a mess, you’re weeping into Beto’s chest because he’s like 7 inches taller than you and he just keeps patting your back and saying “You gotta love Ted, man. Ted has to love Ted.” \n\nHe’s even crying a little too because he’s a genuinely good person and this is a sincerely emotional moment. \n\nHe stands there for as long as you need him to and after a few minutes you feel better. You end the embrace and take a step back. You look him in the eye and tell him thank you. And then you ask him to take good care of her and he says he will. Then he tells you to take good care of yourself. Y’all hug one more time and you walk away sheepishly with your pillowcase full of spray paint cans. \n\nBeto watches you leave and then goes back inside and your ex is like “who was that?” and he says “Nobody” and then blows her back out twice before falling asleep watching your Hulu account.",

And #3 killing Jews.” He said this openly, unmasked, directly to mainstream press outlets, on camera. I don't remember all of his exact words but \"number three: killing Jews\" is a direct quote I do remember. \n\nWould the Democrats *ever*, **ever** dream of using this goldmine of footage in attack ads during an election? Of course not, they’re far too timid for that. It would be demagoguery to do that. It might be misleading, perhaps that guy was talking about some kind of small-r republican values that have nothing to do with the Republican Party.\n\nMeanwhile, the Republicans will run every misleading, demagogic, completely exaggerated smear in the book in their attack ads. Pelosi is black bloc. Antifa is the armed wing of the Democratic Party. Keith Ellison is in the Nation of Islam or better yet he’s in ISIS.   Hillary Clinton had the ambassador to Libya whacked. The Republicans do not give a single solitary *fuck* about decorum, about civility, about not being demagogues.\n\nIt’s fucking pathetic to watch. ",
