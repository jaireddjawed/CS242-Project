        "text": "What are everyone's thoughts on **why new religions emerge in the world from time to time?**  I'm interested in hearing an *anthropological* or *sociological* perspective on this, not just a religious explanation (e.g. \"God sent the messiah or a new prophet, so it was divinely ordained\").  I am thinking of religions that were explicitly founded or inspired by some prophet, guru, or teacher, not religions that grew organically without a founder (such as Yoruba and Shinto).\n\nSome religions that were once 'new' in ancient times include: Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, and Catharism. New sects also emerged in each of these religions after the founder(s) had passed away, such as Ismailism within Shi'ite Islam, the Religious Society of Friends in Christianity, Swedenborgian church, and Zen and Pure Land Buddhism within Buddhism.\n\nSome religions that emerged in more recent times include Sikhism, Wicca, Scientology, Raelism, and the Baha'i Faith.  Sikhism emerged in India, and Baha'i in Iran in different centuries; others listed emerged in the West.",

        "text": "NOTE: This in not a proselytising post. Hindus in general do not proselytise. This is a post about my observations and discussion. \n\nDespite not being a proselytising religion, Hinduism has spread to many countries, including the West. Hinduism is very popular outside of India. Countries where Hinduism is popular outside India include Nepal, USA, UK, Guyana, Fiji, Singapore, Mauritius, Indonesia (in Bali Island), Pakistan and Trinidad and Tobago. There are also many more places I did not list. \n\nHinduism is also spreading indirectly in Western countries among non Asians. For example, yoga, meditation, mindfulness, crystals, cremation, vegetarianism have become very popular in recent years in the West. Also, pantheism and belief in reincarnation is becoming more common. Hinduism is taught in UK schools (I don't know about other Western countries) and inscense is popular. Murtis are being sold in the West too. \"New Age\" is becoming more popular. Lots of \"New Age\" ideas are just Hinduism under a new name.  Bhagavad Gita is also being sold in mainstream bookstores, along with many books about yoga and meditation. The Colour Run brought Holi to the West and Leicester in the UK has the biggest Diwali celebrations outside of India. \n\nYes, in many places in the West, yoga is being practiced for non spiritual reasons, but I am happy that people get to experience this ancient wisdom. Lots of Westerners are aware of \"Om\" and that makes me very happy. \n\nAll of this without proselytising and evangelising! Shows that you don't need proselytising/evangelism to spread your culture and beliefs. \n\nThoughts on my thoughts?",

        "text": "I genuinely think that after years of being raised in a religious household, having parents of faiths, being around people in churches, different spiritualities and having done brief research into different types I have come to the conclusion that all religions are just a crutch for humanity‚Äôs biggest insecurity: mortality. It seems like religion and spirituality is just a huge coping mechanism in order to deal with incomprehensible events or experiences and phenomena that we cannot fathom at our level of existence as humans. To me it makes sense that we are all just looking for ways to justify, reason, relate and cope with mental health and illness, ‚Äúsupernatural‚Äù experiences, extreme views of lifestyle and cultural background. Even death, the after life (if there is one) and the idea of having a higher power (god, multiple gods, spirits/spiritual connections, the universe, etc.) all seem like abstract ideas that have been developed for the sake of taking an objective response to reality due to a subjective disposition. Thus usually resulting in a personification of said ideology in order to make connections between ‚Äúdivinity‚Äù and people. It‚Äôs thoughts like this that make me wonder: Is religion, spirituality and so on and so forth really all that necessary or does it just perpetuate a non existent portrayal of life in order to function as some form of archaic escapism from the reality of our monotonous lives? What is the true essence and value of human life without the sugar coated blanket of astronomical value blown out of proportion?",

Many atheists have told me that if someone is brought up in a religious family from being a child, they are likely to follow the religion of their family as an adult. \n\nThis is very interesting to me, because the majority of people I interact with currently who were brought up in religious families are now very strong atheists.\n\nFor example, my mother. She was raised in a Roman Catholic household and went to Catholic secondary/high school. She is now a very strong atheist. My maths teacher and therapist are both in the same situation as my mother. \n\nThe theists I interact with currently were all either raised in atheist families and converted, or they started believing in a different religion from the one they were exposed to in childhood. \n\nCan anyone show me any studies that state there is a connection between upbringing and current religious belief? I don't want to just accept a claim because loads of atheists told me it. That would be an argument from popularity fallacy and bad reasoning. \n\nDo you think upbringing/family can influence current religious belief?

        "text": "It seems Near Death Experiences (NDEs) are ignored as delusions by both non-believers and even most religious people, but even if they are delusions, they are indeed life changing experiences. \n\nThere is now an abundance of NDE because medicine allows people to be saved from death more than ever, not to mention the many drugs that may induce or facilitate these experiences.\n\nI thought it was just an experience as using LSD or a psychedelic drug, and there seem to be an overlap, but people who experience and NDE claim stuff such as the following:\n\nI noticed these things are often claimed by most people who experienced NDEs during the experience:\n - It seems most of them claim to be \"judged\" (for a lack of a better word) by their good deeds and good intentions rather than their beliefs or lack of.\n - Most of them would prefer that peace over returning to life, but they are somehow convinced by an entity to return.\n - They often meet diseased family members who guide or explain them stuff about the afterlife that they often forgot anyway.\n - Most of them claim some kind of \"life review\", where they feel the pain they caused, but also the love they gave. However, there is no punishment, just some guilt and shame that is strong but not lasting.\n- I find weird most of them claim Heaven have a Greco-Roman style. I think the reason is that often psychedelic experiences are full of fractal patterns and Greco-Roman styles of columns seem to also have a fractal structure. Anther hypothesis is that maybe these experiences inspired Greek style, maybe though psychedelics.\n\nAfter the experience, they also notice stuff is different:\n - Some depressed people claim they finally found the purpose of life and started loving it after their NDE, even being 60 or 70 years old.\n - It seems most religious people relax their dogmas, and most non-believers start believing in God but in a very non-dogmatic way.\n - Many of them claim to re-negotiate life conditions, which if true, that would imply humans have some leverage on their destiny. For instance, many of them claim to be healed or life-long issues suddenly fixed.\n - Most of them claim they are very lucky now and seem to \"attract\" fortune and good things, find love or find a way to make money doing what they love.\n\nRegardless, even if NDEs are delusions, I find it interesting how deep and beautiful the mind can be, and how deep these experiences can be for these people.\n\nHere is a [compilation of these experiences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1La-8uHbV6Q&amp;list=PLTpFZVpQ7M85G6QSVZJYrloDY8BpBK3CG) for people interested.",

        "text": "This is mostly a shower thought so treat it lightly. \n\nMany societies have posited that gods exist who are interested in humanity and that these gods have preferential ways of organizing human society. Every such society, a theocracy, I have learned about has been administrated by humans in the name of separated deities. Whether priests, shamans, divine kings, caesars or otherwise, there's always a visible human being to which civil and political authority flows back to, allegedly backed by an invisible supernatural element. Gods don't collect taxes, pronounce judgment, create civic projects, erect or even hold personal audiences in their temples without a human intermediary. In Judaism it was the priests and prophets, and even now in Christianity organisation and evangelism of the church is done by men in the name and under the authority of the divine.\n\nThe argument is that there are no deities with the a record of effectively contact and organize human groups without a need for agents, perhaps because they are impotent or perhaps they don't exist outside of their supposed agents claims.",

        "text": "OK, here is the Biblical Drama as I understand it: \n1. God promised a Son to Abraham.\n2. Abraham's Wife was too old, like 75 years old. Way old to have any children.\n3. Therefore, Abraham tried to \"help God\" by having a Son with a surrogate mother, Hagar. [Ishmael](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishmael) was born.\n4. It happens that Sarah was fertile after all and she had a Son too, Isaac.\n5. Now Abraham got scared and sent Hagar and Ishmael to the desert to avoid a conflict for inheritance. The Bible does not say it, but probably wanted them to die.\n6. God regardless cared for Hagar and Ismael, and from them come the Ishmaelites, fathering many nations, including many Arab nations. Apparently, they founded Mecca or established there or something.\n7. Regardless Isaac had Jacob, and Jacob is the patriarch of the 12 tribes of Israel.\n8. In a twisted way, [apparently Ishamel also had 12 sons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishmaelites#Hebrew_Bible), so he also founded 12 tribes or something like that.\n\nSo, after all this, centuries later, came Islam claiming Ishmael was the legitimate descendant of Abraham, yet also they kind of accept the prophets and revelations to Israel.\n\nI don't get it, what I am missing here? Islam claims that Ishmael is the legitimate descendant of Abraham, but also the tradition of sons of Jacob are recognized as religious authority.",

When He said \"you will surely die\" is He actually referring to the removal of imortality? Because the phrasing sounds more like sudden death, not dying in a couple hundred years. Did He just use something scary in order to test their obedience?¬†\n\nI have more problems with this passage, like: why is the serpent evil if it just pointed the truth? Why doesn't God want Adam &amp; Eve to know good and evil? Why put the tree in the middle of garden if He knew for a fact that they would disobey Him? But mainly it's the lying that nobody questions that bothers me, because right from the get go it seems as though God really can't be trusted, especially with the heavy punishments He applied. Sudden death would have been a much easier punishment.",

Of the state of the world. Of the constant misinformation and manipulation. \n\nwho is genuinely happy with this existence anymore? Sure fleeting moments of happiness are abound‚Ä¶ but those moments feel so fleeting in comparison to the constant dread of the next day.\n\nI really think no matter what belief you have or religion you have‚Ä¶ surely we all just want eternal peace and happiness at this point.",
