(Montana Institute of Technology), as well as many other hat historians, believe it all started with the Mongol Hordes. This is not as bizarre as it sounds. The Mongols rode small maneuverable horses; they were expert riders and could do anything on horseback they could do on foot. They thrived on the bare necessities, had little use for luxuries or liars, and—until the cowboy—were the greatest horsemen who ever lived. So, like the cowboy, the Mongol needed good boots, a good saddle, and a dang good hat. (Of course, cowboys had better manners and except for Saturday nights, did not tend to make war on the civilian population.)\n\nNaturally, this is a little difficult for me to believe, doubly so because Bender is a humorist (he is better known for authoring *Don't Squat With Yer Spurs On*). While this means that the very short answer to my question in the title is \"no,\" I am still curious: what exactly is the origin of the cowboy hat, if not from fictitious 13th century Mongolian cattle rustlers?",

        "text": "I read today about Honore de Balzac, a French writer who lived from 1799 to 1850 and who supposedly drank 50 cups of coffee a day. This got me thinking about how the strength of our coffee nowadays compares to what we drank in the past. Now, anything more than four or five cups at a time of normal, generic Starbucks branded coffee from the grocery store gives me a headache and racing thoughts, so I can’t imagine drinking fifty in the course of a day. Was the coffee back then that much weaker than what we drink now? If so, what would Balzac’s fifty cups be equal to nowadays?\n\nI’m primarily interested in 1800s France, but I’d also be curious about coffee strength comparisons to other time periods and would welcome any answers related to those.",

        "text": "I'm deep down the internet rabbit hole. Recently read Fredrick Engle's \"Origins of Private Property, the Family and the State\", and his book is based on research by the anthropologist Lewis Henry Morgan. I cannot find counter arguments to Morgan on the internet with his conclusions on polyandry in early human evolution - I suppose apart from the self explanatory idea that men are physically stronger and so have always been the dominant sex. What evidence is there to support/rebut Morgan? \n\nTo summarise the evolution of relationships and family outlined in OOPPTFATTS:\n\n1. Early hunter gatherers didn't have societal structure. There were only a few people who knew each other. Relationships were most likely incestuous. \n2. Once family groups became large enough to form clans, the women biologically were tied to the home (only ones who can nurse a baby) and so men had to go out and hunt/gather for food. This means that the women ruled the household, since they got to choose which man stayed. Females were the dominant sex. Families were polyandrous. The household property was inherited through maternal lineage, with the female children inheriting the household and the clan. \n3. Farming was developed. This meant that the men worked the fields, and thus had property. It became apparent that who inherited the field after the man died was unclear. He didn't know who his children were (polyandry) and so it became relevant for men to remember who their children were. Therefore, men would pair up with women at least for a time so they could remember who their child was, to then hand the property to them when they died. \n4. This system was too clunky. Temporary fidelity of women and therefore clear lineage became impractical for a man. They essentially demanded to have a woman swear loyalty to them, so that they could have clear-cut property inheritance. And with arguments over property rights - (without a group of matriarchs clearly occupying a single household, property boundaries became unclear. Who owned exactly what land wasn't clear. Fights broke out, alliances formed, and thus states were born. Along with this came dominance and blood, slavery, then feudalism and finally capitalism.\n\nBasically, I'm asking for counter arguments. And if there is any substance to these claims. I have never read a historical book that clearly defines the origins of the state in the way that Engles does. But historians of Reddit, I'm sure you can help.",

How, for example, did the people living in France in the years before the French Revolution see society? I mean in terms of its stability/longevity and the likelihood of revolution. I was inspired to ask this because I wanted to reply to a comment that said:   \n\n\n&gt; Americans are way too domesticated to start a revolution at this point.  You're far past the point where it was warranted, and are still just fighting amongst yourselves.   \n\n\nI expect the answer is some variety of 'it's complicated', but what are the main strands here? My hunch is that, for most people, society seemed very stable: perhaps it had an air of finality - 'always been this way, always will be'. Revolution, for the people in my hunch, would seem totally impossible, right up until it wasn't, by which time it had already become seemingly inevitable (whether that's *really* the case, I guess, is another question). Another hunch would be that maybe there were already some perceptive/pessimistic prophets of doom early on, but... I dunno really? Wondered if any of you had any actual insight here!   \n\n\nThanks!",

I am interested in examining three tenets, which he calls \"astrategic,\" \"impatient,\" and \"sensitive to casualties.\" I provide his definitions for these terms below.\n\nCould you please provide examples of articles or book chapters that examine these three tenets during the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the wars in the Gulf from Desert Storm until the present? \n\nThanks in advance for your help!\n\n\\----\n\nDefinitions and reference:\n\nAstrategic: \"Strategy is, or should be, the bridge that connects military power with policy. When Americans wage war as a largely autonomous activity, leaving worry about peace and its politics to some later day, the strategy bridge has broken down.\"\n\nImpatient: \"Americans have approached warfare as a regrettable, occasional evil that has to be concluded as decisively and rapidly as possible. That partially moral perspective has not always sat well with the requirements of a politically effective use of force.\"\n\nCasualty-Sensitive: \"In common with the Roman Empire, the American guardian of world order is much averse to suffering a high rate of military casualties, and for at least one of the same reasons. Both superstates had and have armies that are small, too small in the opinion of many, relative to their responsibilities. Moreover, well-trained professional soldiers, volunteers all, are expensive to raise, train, and retain, and are difficult to replace. Beyond the issue of cost-effectiveness, however, lies the claim that American society has become so sensitive to casualties that the domestic context for U.S. military action is no longer tolerant of bloody ventures in muscular imperial governance. The most careful recent sociological research suggests that this popular notion about the American way of war, that it must seek to avoid American casualties at almost any price, has been exaggerated.\"\n\n1.

For example: Mamoru Oshii's works, Akira, Steamboy, the Metropolis remake, a Wind named Amnesia, Ninja Scrolls, Macross, the Vampire Hunter D movies, Venus Wars, Perfect Blue, Green Legend Ran, Evangelion, Monster, etc. Whereas contemporary anime, with the exception of Attack on Titan and Chainsaw man seems to be sillier, with exaggerated cartoon faces, \"chibi\" type expressions (I'm thinking in particular Full-metal Alchemist which while definitely a serious and dramatic show still has exaggerated tear-drops, stinky lines, ridiculously flailing arms, etc. Basically just an exaggerated cartoonish-ness).\n\nI've asked the question of some anime subs and there answer was that these were just the things that were considered appropriate to the US audience so that's all I saw, which I think is certainly a possibility, but I still feel there was just *more* dark, serious, dramatic animes during that time period than there have been since.\n\nOn a related question I'm really curious about animation quality during this time. I remember when digital animation started to be incorporated into anime and I feel like during the period immediately preceding and shortly after digital animation being widespread, there was an incredibly high quality of hand drawn animation, even when it did incorporate some digital effects. I'm specifically thinking about the Spriggan movie, the Patlabor and Ghost in the shell movies, Perfect Blue, Akira, Metropolis, and Vampire Hunter D: bloodlust. I'm aware that all of these movies had incredibly well-respected people attached to them so is it just that they got a dream budget?",

I knew soldiers would switch from Territorial Forces to the front-line regiments but not the other way around.  Another question I have is why might a medal card not state a \"theater of war\" as I have seen that my great relatives' WW1 medal cards state the theater of war whilst the medal card for the medal I have purchased does not state a theater of war. This is what makes me think they were in the Suffolk regiment at home and then transferred to the territorial forces because the medal card states the Suffolk regiment at the top o the list (making me think its the first regiment they were enlisted at) than in the collum bellow it says labour corps. (leading me to believe they were transferred there and not sent abroad to the front lines)\n\nI hope this is okay to post here.  it's just a burning question that's been bothering me a lot and it all seems so confusing.  \n\n\nThank you all for reading!  \n\n\nChloe155.",

The battle of Waterloo started at 11 am, and only around 4 pm the Prussians arrived (With the final Imperial Guard charge at 7pm.). The battle of Wagram lasted for two days. In battles like Austerlitz, even local engagements around Sokolnitz and Telnitz started at 8 am and lasted pretty much the entire battle until ~2pm. \n\nSo why did these battles last for so long? Despite, what I imagine, the incredible stress of the battlefield: the terrifying sound of gunfire, cannonballs flying around, men dropping like all around you, etc. etc.",
