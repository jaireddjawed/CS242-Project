After doing some research, I found out that EMPs don't actually work the way games and movies make it seem. In an effort to keep what I'm writing at least somewhat plausible, I come to you all with a question.\n\nWhat are some possibly realistic ways technology can evolve that would allow the disruption of electronics in the same way that EMPs disable electronics in video games/movies?\n\nI tried posting this on AskScience but the post was locked.

It would be inconsiderate to decide to get gene therapy to increase one's intelligence by getting as many genes as possible linked with higher intelligence.

(I know the latter is already going through testing and experimentation but the fact that it is still very new and somewhat crazy to be true, it somehow looks like a pseudoscience)\n\nWhat about patterns that are not actually there?\n\nEven scientists make mistakes and seek patterns in the wrong ways or think that they found a pattern that does not actually exist or it is analysed in the wrong manner ('post hoc, ergo propter hoc') like scientific racism was actually a thing which eventually turned out to be something that people rationalised instead of trying to be rational about.\n\nThere were also new \"discoveries\" that turned out to be discoveries done wrongly (what we would call \"pathological science\") like they once thought that they found a new X-ray called the N-Ray, or they thought that they found a new structure for water called Polywater but repeated experiments showed different results.\n\nThere were even pseudo-sciences that eventually led to more refined sciences like phrenology eventually led to the more refined neuropsychology which is heavily supported by advanced brain screening technology.\n\nI know that in order to make sure that you have a good science, you must have good and standardised tests and measurements which are both valid and reliable (which take a lot of time to make sure that are actually accurate), repeatable experiments that will provide the same results (which is tough to do in some sciences like psychology or sociology, or even paleontology because most of its research involves examining fossils that are millions of years old), and experiments that can be peer-reviewed by people who are more proficient or have some expertise in certain areas, or the most important one, that can be disproven (which is also a difficult thing to do because you cannot accurately disprove the existence of gravitational pull, for example, or perhaps disproving the existence of the unconscious because the unconscious is something that you can only observe or deduce via other people's behaviours and can never actually be seen directly or physically)\n\nBut this is something I think is very difficult to do whenever there is something relatively new like a new discovery or a new sub-discipline of a certain science.\n\nSo how can one definetely or accurately make the distinction between a pseudo-science and an actual science? Can something eventually transform from a pseudo-science into an actual science (like for example, psychology has been around for a long time but was mostly tested in a more \"scientific\" manner when Freud was around but you cannot rely define his case studies was scientific as they were mostly about personal clients and not exactly quantitative or did not involve large sample sizes)",

Just how small can we make an atomic weapon, and what materials would it use? Could we make a hand held atomic rocket launcher, or perhaps a tiny atomic grenade? Granted, it seems like suicide to use, but I'm very curious to what is the smallest possible atomic explosion theoretically possible. What materials would be used to reach critical mass? Thank you.",

As a software engineer you are trained (and generally operate) in the business space - private sector, with the odd electrical or mechanical engineering government project thrown in for good measure.\n\nIt seems to me that the majority of environmental work (software-based and otherwise) that can actually make a difference to our world must necessarily be either government-driven or university-driven. This is not a problem in itself (though some might disagree), but it does make \"finding work\" and \"understanding what is actually going on in this space at a practical level\" significantly harder.\n\nSo to my question - what are software engineers doing in the environmental and ecological conservation space, and what can we do to make a difference?",

        "text": "/u/panchoop replied to a comment on a question in this subreddit concerning abiogenesis with a a link to an interesting bit of math he did. He essentially posits that the chances of a biomolecule of 100 atoms spontaneously during the lifetime of the universe is 1/10^293.\n\nI have insufficient statistics knowledge to explore his math deeply, but his conceptualization of the problem is rich for exploration:\n\n&gt;it doesn't matter, the probability can be smaller.\n\n&gt;There is no good argument, that I know, for this probability to have a lower bound that would be anywhere significant with respect to the \"trials\" you propose.\n\n&gt;Edit: there are many downvotes so I will sketch an example of why this probability could be so small so you can imagine why this is not just mathematical bullshitting.\n\n&gt;Say there are M particles that can only be allocated in a discrete grid of N times N locations (we also completely neglect orientation)\n\n&gt;Say the cell is composed of M =100 particles in this grid and can be formed with one specific configuration. also we consider the grid size to be N = 100.\n\n&gt;So, the number of possible configurations is:\n\n&gt;(N2 )(N2 -1)* ... *(N2 - M+1)\n\n&gt;that is about 10^400\n\n&gt;So, assuming all configurations have the same probability, the possibility of the cell emerging spontaneously is 1/10^400\n\n&gt;Now, let's see the number of trials, there are an estimate of 1080 particles in the observable universe\n\n&gt;So, just to exaggerate and to capture all the possible places where a cell could be formed, let's assume there are 1080 NxN patches in which the cell could be formed.\n\n&gt;Now, the universe is 13.7 billion years old, that is a bit less than 10^27 nanoseconds. So, assuming that there is a trial each nanosecond and these trials are independent, there has been an amount of 10^80 * 10^27 = 10^107 trials for this cell to emerge.\n\n&gt;So, the probability of a cell appearing at least once in the whole history of the observable universe is 1- (probability of not emerging)number of trials\n\n&gt;In the first order (approximating by Taylor expansions), this gives\n\n&gt;10^107-400 = 1/10^293.\n\n&gt;That, unimaginable small number, would be the probability of this hypothetical cell to have emerged out of nowhere.\n\nMy argument here would be that the simplest building blocks of biology are much smaller than 100 atoms. A glycine molecule is only 10 atoms for instance. Using these 10-20 atom molecules with defined reactivity, spontaneous reactions (such as polycondensation) between them could give the dimers/trimers/polymers which life is made of.. We see virtually everywhere that biology starts with a defined subset of basic structures (guanidine, ester, amide, certain alkyl chains lengths, phenol, etc) and converts from there.\n",

So if I got an oxygen generator or tank, and a mask to make sure that I don't re-breathe any CO2, would this reduce the burden on my lungs, and result in less misery?  My heart would still have to work just as hard, of course.   \n Ordinary air is only \\~20&amp;#37; oxygen, so pure oxygen is up to 5x better.  Or would I still have to breathe just as hard, in order to get rid of CO2?\n\nSurely someone has tried this?\n\nMore details, if interested:\n\nSo I've been trying to lose weight.  In the last few months, I've got to where I can run a 5K in \\~30 minutes (6mph), burning about 500 calories per 30 minutes, according to the treadmill.\n\nBut I know that I won't be able to keep this up in the long term.  Running (or elliptical, stair climbing, or any activity that burns calories at that rate) is just too miserable, too painful, too torturous.  I dread it all day.  And I've noticed that the discomfort is mostly with my lungs, not my legs (which is why the exact activity doesn't make much difference, if it's burning calories at the same rate).  Not looking to run farther.  Just run the same distance, with less discomfort.\n\nProbably would be too good to be true.  If there was a real way to burn calories quick, with less discomfort, so you can eat more, then I suppose everyone would be doing it.  Every gym would have oxygen by the treadmills.\n\nPosting in asksciencediscussion, as I never have any luck getting posts approved in regular askscience.",
