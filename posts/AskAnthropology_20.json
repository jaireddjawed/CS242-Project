        "text": "For example, let's say that, for the sake of the question, someone was able to go back in time, kidnap me as an infant and put me into an entirely different environment than that in which I grew up, where I would be raised by different parents in a different country with a different climate, a different culture and different beliefs. Would I be an entirely different person? Or is there a certain \"blueprint\" inside me that defines basic aspects of my character regardless of what environment and under what influence I would eventually grow up? If so, has there ever been a way to proof or at least estimate how much of it is ingrained in a person beforehand and how much comes from growing up in a certain environment with the influence of other people and their culture?\n\nMy best guess it that probably some sort of rough, basic behavioural pattern is imprinted in us through the DNA of our ancestors, kind of like some inherent potential to turn out certain ways, and then environmental influences like how we are raised by our parents or more general whatever we experience and whomever we interact with shape this potential into more concrete forms, but... Yeah, is there any scientific research on this?\n\n(Just in case you're interested in the background that lead me to this question: The reason I am asking myself all this is that, although I am not really religious and do not believe in reincarnation, I find the concept very interesting and suddenly had this thought pop up: Since ‚Äì to the best of my knowledge of this concept ‚Äì a person that has been reincarnated does usually not remember his previous life and also grows up under entirely different circumstances than his previous life, wouldn't that mean that it usually makes no difference whether or not you are reborn, since you would be someone entirely different, anyway? And that then made me think about the above topic of: what exactly defines someone's nature to begin with, and to what extent is it present before external environmental influence happens?)\n\nAnyway, I hope this is the right place for that question, and thanks for your time!",

I'm studying for my final in physical anthro, specifically about human evolution, and I'm having trouble understanding the differences between the three items in the title.\n\nMy understanding is that all primates have a postorbital bar, which connects the frontal bone to the cheekbone. This makes sense. Postorbital plates are only found in haplorhines and are found behind the eye socket, sort of closing them off from the back of the skull. This too makes sense, but in the practice questions for my final, I'm finding references to a postorbital septum, which I can't find in my textbook at all, and can't really find much information on online. I'm suspecting it's just another word for the postorbital plate, but want to be sure‚Äîare they the same thing? If not, what is a postorbital septum, and in what species can it be found?\n\nThanks for the help.\n\n",

Then expanding into what is now know as italy could have it be isolated by the mountains and sea from any other civillization. Although I can imagine that settlements near large rivers within a large region of infertility could attract a lot of people and would make for isolation too, which reduces any external risks.

One where the parent devotes all of time and energy into raising just a small number of children, with a large chance that they all survive (a giraffe). And one where the parent spreads their time and energy over a huge number of offspring, where most of them do not necessarily need to survive (a spider). And I know that there are many mediums in between these two extremes. \n\n(This is known as r/K selection theory.)\n\nI also get and understand from a cultural perspective that many rich people in developed nations choose to hold off on having children because they want to focus on their career or education, or \"enjoying their youth\". And end up having fewer. \n\nBut, from an evolutionary perspective it is *counter intuitive* that a population with an overabundance of resources, such as Germany and United States would have such a low birthrate. There is so much food, space, energy, and wealth to take advantage of, yet it also seems like they choose not to. \n\nLooking at an individual in a country such as the United States, from an evolutionary perspective, it seems like they would be in the perfect position to have as many children as possible. Because of the strong social structure, it doesn't matter how poor you are, or how many children you have, the chances that each one doesn't live to be at least 40 years old is really slim. And since violating a person's reproductive rights is considered akin to eugenics, there's pretty much nothing to stop each individual from having dozens of children. And if they did so, they'd end up with a much stronger and bigger clade than the people who chose to only have 2 children. \n\nObviously, if every person did this, then society would collapse. But it's still hard to wrap my head around why the average *individual* in a place like Germany, one of the most secure and safe places in the world, would choose to have less than 2 children. \n\nFrom an evolutionary perspective, it seems like people in developed nations would be thinking \"Damn, we're living in a place with more food than we can ever hope to eat, and almost nobody dies before reaching old age? Time to get those clade numbers really high!!\"\n\n-------\n\nEDIT: By the way, I'm not a white supremacist. Sorry you guys have to deal with those guys so often. \n\nI actually got the idea for this thread after discussing the overpopulation themes of Infinity War. ",

        "text": "I‚Äôve thought a lot lately about the fact that humans as a species have effectively removed ourselves from the natural course of evolution. Culture and society have been built up to collectively insulate us from hunger, disease, etc. which would otherwise be encountered in a population without luxuries such as modern medicine, industrial agriculture, and others. People who ordinarily wouldn‚Äôt have been ‚Äúselected‚Äù in nature instead survive due to modern amenities and technology. \n\nSo, given that we are now reproducing and existing almost entirely within the confines of the protective bubble that is society and culture, what could we look like in 10,000 years? Or more broadly, what potential long term impact could the creation/progression of society and culture have on our longevity as a species? Or is this even a concept which is recognized as legitimate amongst those in the anthropological community?",

Specifically in his career, he wants to be a CSI guy \\(sorry for the crude description, but I am not familiar with the anthro language, and he isn't here while I'm writing this to tell me the right title\\). \n\nHe has some \\(\\~ a semester\\) research experience, but more in archeological anthropology, so it might not count for a lot. \n\nGraduated with a 3.2 GPA but a higher major GPA, I think. He has not taken the GRE.\n\nWe would really like to bulk up his CV, but there are not a lot of anthropology related research assistant jobs. I do see some for biology and read that a biology background can be helpful when applying for grad school, but I want to make sure.\n\nAny help would be appreciated!

As a forewarning, I apologize for how shite my terminology is about to be with this question... But like half of my family is from the British isles, and that's a very obvious difference than the other half that's from North Africa. But I'd assume that if you looked at my genetic make up you could clearly pinpoint the genetic differences by which family tree they came from. But at some point all humans became what we currently are in Africa and then spread across the globe. What's the time frame difference between \"beginning\" as a species to inhabiting all of these incredibly diverse region? And then from there, how long did my family have to stay in the British Isles to mutate the specific traits that still present as different to other ethnicities to these days? And if someone looked at my DNA (like the 23andme stuff) could they literally tell me \"you got X quality from your ancestors living in the British Isles\" or is it more like \"you have X quality, which people from the British Isles tend to develop, which leads us to believe your ancestry is from there\"? \n\nI absolutely understand how genetic descent works, but like you're saying, there's a huge disconnect between how it actually works and how we (especially Americans) discuss our ancestry. How long did it take these large phenotype differences to arise, and how specifically can we pinpoint what regions of the world these differences happened?",

        "text": "Hey guys, im trying to better understand prehistoric sexual relations/gender roles by looking at several different view points. Iv heard some say that life was more communal and egalitarian while other seem to hint towards a kind of \"proto-patriarchy\" where men dominated and controlled women.\n\nThis article points to the latter http://www.radicalfeminism.co.uk/heterosexuality.html\n\nMy question is more or less the following, is their presentation of prehistoric sexual relations based on factual information? Do you agree with their view points in their comparison of prehistoric humanity to other primate societies? Were these relations Egalitarian or oppressive in nature and do we even have the means of knowing if it was either?\n",
