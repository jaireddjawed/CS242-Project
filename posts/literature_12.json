        "text": "Years ago I was forced to read this abysmal waste of paper and it didn’t even count for anything in the end. I never got around to finding any literary expert or enthusiast to explain how anyone could ever respect this kind of writing, so now I turn to you all. If there’s anyone out there that is familiar with this book or author, I’d very much appreciate it if you looked at the VERY short version of my MANY complaints about this book and tell me if I’m in crazy town for thinking this book should NEVER have left the cutting room floor.\n\nBut first a disclaimer: I read this over 5 years ago and deleted the notes I kept, thinking that I’d never get around to doing a review like this, but I decided I couldn’t let it escape my rage anyway. Rest assured, any inaccuracies I display in this review accurately reflect the confusion of young Largicharg during and just after completing this mind-numbing chore of a read.\n\nBeginning with the first impression, Als must’ve taken the old phrase “don’t judge a book by it’s cover” as an excuse to lie to anyone who looked upon his. The title “White Girls” honestly sounds like a joke as the majority of the book is made up of stories about black guys. This disparity is never explained. The back cover, which is normally where you put a blurb to help the reader understand the contents (something this book needs more than any other) is pretentiously littered with positive but extremely generic review quotes which I was convinced had to be either mined, bought, forged or speaking of a different work entirely. \n\nFor anyone who does decide to ignore the cover, Als decides to hit you with even more unnecessary confusion with the title of the first story: “Tristes Tropiques.” I don’t know why Als expects you to know or even recognize French out of the gate, but it took a visit from my friend who took French to do so. I vaguely remember him translating it as “sad stories,” although DeepL translates it to “Sad tropics” or “sadness of the tropics.” Pick whichever name you want, but to me it will always be how I originally read it: “Tris-tee’s tropic-queues” which became synonymous with “torture” within the first few pages. \n\nHowever you pronounce it, Tristes Tropiques takes up nearly one third of the book, and it is by far the worst story in the book, if not the world. Whatever plot this abomination was supposed to convey is distorted beyond recognition in ALS’s incoherent babble which I hesitate to call a “style.” All I could gather from those 97 pages was that the story centers around Als himself and his love interest “SL.” SL gets an introduction and some exposition at the start of the story, but you can’t point to where said introduction ends because the narration blurs the lines between a character’s physical actions and the metaphors that describe their traits. This can be poetic in moderation but Als made the terrible mistake of maintaining this ambiguity through the entirety of the story. By the time anything of real importance to the plot has happened, you are left wondering where you are, who Als is talking about and why you should care. 97 pages in, and said questions in my mind were still unresolved. \n\nWhat follows the most incoherent biography ever written are the most incoherent biographies of the book’s represented figures ever written. They are all plagued with Als’s insufferable overuse of metaphors. That is not to say that all of them are as much of a slog to get through as Tristes Tropiques. For one thing, these successive biographies are mercifully shorter and may tell the tale of interesting celebrity such as Micheal Jackson or Richard Pryor. Here in lies the problem, Als’s writing is only bearable when you have enough information and/or personal investment on the subject beforehand to provide context to Als’s attempts at metaphors. By this point in the book, you have no reason to trust what Als says and plenty of reasons to distrust him, but are at least able to project his endlessly redundant imagery onto an otherwise accurate image of the well-known figure in question. \n\nThat said, a biography that requires knowledge and personal investment in the subject is no biography at all. Amongst the subjects of this book, Pryor and Jackson have the privilege of their time in the limelight and many infinitely better biographies to tell their stories, but the poor individuals, whose stories are less often told, were introduced by this book in the worst way possible. All of the figures in these books have the displeasure of being represented by a man who is either too pretentious or incompetent to do so with the slightest attention to coherence. The one thing that was clear in Hilton Als’s White NOISE is his attempt to make me pity these figures he writes of. In that alone, he succeeded, because it’s a pity that most of their biographies couldn’t have a better author.\n\nAnd with that, I can finally put this horrid thing to rest. I originally planned to use it as a fire starter, but decided instead to donate it in hopes that someone out there will value it more than the frankly generous $0.74 offered by the bookstore. If that describes you, I am genuinely curious as to why you place a dollar’s value in this book. I welcome you to share any explanations or corrections about it that you can. All that I ask is that you make your responses more detailed than the words on the cover of the book, and more coherent than the words within.",

        "text": "Point of view: Ren \n       I am in the midst of a battle with my hand on the trigger of my sniper. Readying myself, I take a deep breath and take the shot. This was the turning point of the war. After I took that shot I felt a hand on my shoulder, it was the vice commander Roy. Roy is a very bright man who is very uplifting and has a very safe aura to him. He is an average height man with short white hair.\n       “That was a good shot, but we have to go. They have more men than we anticipated.” says vice commander Roy\n       “Yes sir.” I grab my sniper and prepare to retreat back to our bunker. As I turn, I notice only a few of us are still alive. With the enemy getting closer, I start running so I do not fall in combat like my valiant comrades. As I get back to the bunker, I hear the sound of  tanks rolling over trees. Then, I head into the bunker with the few allies I have left.\n         “That was disgraceful soldiers!” yells commander Arwel  “We should have won that battle! I took everything into consideration; the amount of men, resources, ammo, supplies, how long reinforcements would take. EVERYTHING I SAY!”\n       “They just had more men than us, that is it. None of what happened was your fault.” reinsures Vice commander Roy.\n       “That is not important as of right now. Men, prepare to fight for your lives.” Says commander Arwel. \n       I grab my sniper and get on the ground to prepare for an attack. Before I can look through the scope, I see a bomb flying through the sky, targeted at our bunker.\n      “You have been reborn into a world of swords and magic.” says an unfamiliar voice.\n     “Who’s there?\" I say confused. \n     “Welcome to the afterlife, Ren.” says the unfamiliar voice\n     I regain my sight and look around. I see Commander Arwel, Vice Commander Roy, and Zack, another average soldier like me.  “Who’s there?” says Commander Arwel. \n     “You have all died and have been brought to the afterlife. I am Selene, goddess of the moon. I will give you guys two choices.” says the goddess.\n     “What are those choices?” Asks the Vice commander. \n     “To either be reincarnated into the world of swords and magic or sent back to your world as an upper classed citizen of society. I will give you guys a little bit of time to think about it, then I will take each of you in a room alone and ask for your final decision.” says The Goddess. \n    “How much time will we be given?” I ask\n    “Approximately thirty more seconds until I question you all individually, so some of you have more time than others.” says Goddess Selene.\n   “What the hell that's barely any time.'' I thought to myself. \n   I looked around and could tell everyone was thinking the same thing as me.   \n“Time is up,” announces The Goddess “Roy you will be the first to be questioned”\nSays the Goddess. \n   I see Roy follow the Goddess down a long hallway that when I look at it, it makes me feel like I am looking into the vacuum of space itself.\n\nPoint of view: Roy\nI was chosen first to make my decision of either being reincarnated into the world of swords and magic or to be sent back to my previous world as an upper class citizen. When the goddess first chose me I was frozen with because I did not believe she was serious. “Hurry along now we haven’t got all day.” Says the goddess, a little agitated. I then regain my composure and follow swiftly along what appears to be a deep pink and light orange hallway. When we get to the door I hear The Goddess whisper “aperi ianuam” and the door opens instantly. We enter and I take a seat in a chair that was fit for a king, it was made out of gold, silver, bronze, and many other precious metals that looked unworldly.",

Let’s say at the end of a book, a character’s skill in chess comes in handy to solve a problem, and earlier in the book he was depicted as playing chess very well.\nDoes this HAVE to be foreshadowing? To me, it’s foreshadowing if a CLUE is given either through dialogue or setting that this is crucial. Otherwise, I would say this is just context given by the author. The author isn’t OMINOUSLY setting the scene to show the importance of chess, but merely giving the reader knowledge of  the characters credibility as a chess player for the climax of the story to be more believable.\nAm I wrong here?",

        "text": "So, recently, my brother finished his college math final and ended the class with over a 100% (as a junior in high school). I’m incredibly proud of him, but can’t help feeling… Upset. I took the same class as a junior last year and got a much lower score, but it makes sense since math isn’t one of my strong suits.\n\nNow, onto the main point: every time I see one of my friends do well in a STEM class or academic related endeavor, I’m proud (obviously) but can’t help but feel like a bit of a failure. I don’t do as well as them. But when it comes to English, I do better than all of them. And yet, everyone around us praise them, and never me.\n\nMaybe I’m just being selfish, maybe it’s a problem with me and not English literature, but it’s got me thinking. Why does it seem like people don’t value English as much as STEM? How do I combat those feelings of disappointment when people gush over my friend’s science fair but push my national writing competition to the side? \n\nReally, it’s so discouraging seeing things like this. My entire family is texting my brother saying congrats and all that, but when I got the highest score on the ap lit test, my parents didn’t even make me feel like they were proud of me. \n\nI’m sorry if this seems like a bit of a rant/vent, but I guess in the end, that’s what it is. I’m frustrated, exasperated, and somewhat angry. Thanks for taking the time to listen.",

(1968)](https://youtu.be/EXhh7wxovxA) \n- [The V.I.P.s (1963)](https://youtu.be/dC3JZoYhGmA) (here’s the trailer, and the Warner Bros Archive channel offers some clips; although, I suggest to buy the DVD.\n\nBeing my parents divorced, there’s a two-episode series (always starring Elizabeth and Richard) telling the story of an American couple living in Rome in the 70s, through the eyes of both the husband and the wife: \n- [EP. 1: Divorce His (1973)](https://youtu.be/QoJ6HwcK0TM)\n- [EP. 2 Divorce Hers (1973)](https://youtu.be/PPJy4eLUI1I)\n\nThen I read The Richard Burton Diaries (published by Yale University Press) and found them beautifully written, an insight on the troubled personality of a successful and nonetheless talented, tragically ironic Shakespearean actor, who also happened to be an acculturate avid reader, an alcoholic, and a nicotine addict. Which we love, don’t we? \n\nJoan Didion would collocate him among the “keepers of private notebooks, a different breed altogether, lonely and resistant rearrangers of things, anxious malcontents, children afflicted apparently at birth with some presentment of loss” ([from “On Keeping a Notebook”](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0Bzn29x7d157GYWRNS0VkcDlwT0k/edit?resourcekey=0-6-hrDwLXnRPI4wF2zHODUg).\n\nHave you read the diaries or happen to know about RB?\nWhat do you think?

It's almost uncanny how perfectly the author shows how tragedy, habit, or just the physical process of aging changes the way the characters behave and interact with each other--the father, for instance, softening towards his children while his submissive wife begins to allow herself to show previously suppressed emotions. \nAny other great examples of this?",

Women are only of worth to the protagonists if they provide them with sexual pleasure. In Serotonin the protags girlfriend is praised only and especially for her behind-stuff. I often laugh when I read Houellebecq writing about women, because the ideas and thoughts are so ridicoulous I can't take them seriously.\n\nI wonder what you think about this? Is Houellebecq just writing from the male gaze? Even though I despise this man, I still think he is culturally important (in capturing the emptiness, hopelessness and depression in modern times).",

I’d especially love suggestions that will help me with both my major and minor. I also like poetry.\n\nAlso, if anyone has any other advice or tips for an incoming English major, I am deeply grateful. Even if it’s books or discussions on literary theory or anything that’s not the book itself (if that makes sense). I’ve been scrolling through this sub looking at conversations lol.\n\nI don’t exactly care all that much on how difficult the book or story is considered. I passed the AP lit test last year with a 5, and enjoy a challenge that will make my brain turn. If it helps, some of my favorite writers right now are Plath, Kafka, Camus (I love The Stranger), and Wilde.\n\nThank you so much for any help!",

I can recognize the craft, and the painstaking attention to detail involved in such a creation, but I have trouble actually imagining what the words seek to convey.\n\nSo I usually read over these passages in sort of a daze and promptly forget the details, except for those I glean are of symbolic value. \n\nBut I’m starting to think maybe this difficulty of mine isn’t universal like I’ve always assumed. It seems to be such common device of literature, maybe even crucial to literature, and maybe my brain just doesn’t work like that?\n\nWhen you read do you have clear and unique images in your mind for what a character looks like, how they dress, etc?",

Jack is the protagonist we’re meant to root for, yet he has no ethical justification for stealing the giant’s things. What one needs to understand is that good would not be perceived as good if there were no antagonizing factors. There are cases where balance is necessary to make one feel human. Take the case of Villains like Loki and Snape and why it is that watchers sympathize with them and why they relate to them, It is because they seem human though meant to be portrayed as evil. it is the slightest of vulnerability they show and the reason for their ‘evil’ that allow people to see them as people of reality. Unlike heroes or ‘good protagonists’ who seem to have not even a spec of a bad quality or past in them. Again, that is why ‘grey’ protagonists, or as defined by google, Morally grey characters aren't quite villains, but they are too twisted to be traditional heroes” like Deadpool have a huge popularity rate. ",

This book awakened great self compassion within me. The way he allows no wrong answers in his dialogue with himself while tying in philosophical concepts. he seems so human and at the same time such an egoist. I feel so empowered by focusing on the present where we can control and I feel relieved of my self judgement when I release myself from rehashing my past or attempting futility to predict my future.",
