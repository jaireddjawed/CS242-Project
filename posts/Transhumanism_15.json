        "text": "I read that some transhumanists do not believe in cryonics because (they say) if someone's brain is \"turned off\", when is \"turned on\" again a new \"ego\" is created, not the old one. Some are so extreme to say that this would happen even in an general anesthesia [source](http://www.benbest.com/philo/doubles.html)\n\nWhat do you think about that? I'm not a materialistic (nor a transhumanist, only like to search about), but this seems to be a very flawed and incoherent concept of materialism. \n\nIf the person does not believe that there is a soul and believes that the mind is completely generated by the brain, one cannot believe that there is an ego beyond the brain. This thought seems to me what Dennet (don't like him, but I think he was right there) calls \"Cartesian Materialism\", a position that nobody open defends but Dennet says is common to scientists implicitly maintain, that there is a \"center\" of consciousness in the brain, like a little person inside your head\n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Cartesian_Theater.svg/600px-Cartesian_Theater.svg.png\n\nBut, people (neuro scientists and philosophers) who defend mind materialism say that conscience isn't experimented by a fixed subject generated by the brain, but every moment a new subject is generated (well, even that they disagree, most of them say that even the subject does not exist, what exist are sensations, with no subject to experiment them). \n\nSo, if a brain is turned off, and after that turned on, there will be no change of the subject different from the change of subject of every moment, according to the mind materialism theory. So would be no difference in cryonics or even mind upload according to a materialistic personal identity concept.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n\n",

His tombstone appears to be quite expensive.\n\nHe was the 9th of a generation of executioners. In other words, he was bred to be completely unsympathetic and feelingless towards his victims, whom he just numbered in his journal of every execution he ever performed. In his house after the war, the name of Sophie Scholl and her friends were forbidden; they had to be referred as the number he gave to them.\n\nTranshumanism is to breed such feelingless people. \n\nUS Police are trained to feel nothing about the people they kill. After a few years on the job, they do feel nothing, and even after retirement they just blot that part of their career, and their family members, often succeeding their parents to the job, do the same, breeding a new race of people who do not feel anything about killing potentially innocent people. \n\nAs far as the Elites think, it's just 'too bad'.\n\n==\n\nConquering space is not an easy job. \n\nWe need people who can feel nothing, including pain, suffering, etc. \n\nIn a lot of space operas, aliens have feelings too. Which will make them weak.\n\nA race of Transhumans without any feelings, but only acting with what is beneficial or not, is what we need to conquer space.\n\nWe don't fully understand how the brain works, but if we can eradicate feeling and replace them with digital thought process, which could be done in maybe 10 years if enough money is invested and all restrictions against human experiments are dropped,\n\nwe will be able  to develop a race of feelingless, empathyless transhumans who will feel nothing about slaughtering lots and lots of aliens, while enduring all the rigour , difficulties and hardship of space travel.",

Pretty much running with the Atlantis being an advanced isolationist society set about 10,000 years ago who were obliterated by a high energy experiment that wiped them out except for a handful who were off the island at the time.\n\nI want these Atlanteans to be correctly advanced as much as possible with an accurate transhumanist approach and no goddamn glowing crystals.\n\nSo far I want them to have advanced integrated bio-tech. In full control of their own genetic code either with nano-bots in their system to heal or slowly modify their body to easily incorporate into different societies and of course relative biological immortality. \n\nI want them to have brain enhancements to allow a sort of short range telepathy between survivors, perfect recall and essentially a built in hard drive of all of the Atlanteans knowledge. Possibly an integrated AI and perhaps being able to manipulate anything wi-fi based with a thought. Being enhanced they will probably have to deal with time perception being slowed as well so need something to balance that.\n\nBasic premise of the story is an ongoing conversation with one who tells of how they've acted throughout history by acting in leadership roles or advisor roles to build a civilisation that has the infrastructure of home. I mean you could walk around with information on how to build a fusion reactor in your head but unless the resources and infrastructure are there its essentially useless knowledge.\n\nProblem is everytime they start to get somewhere their society goes to war either because people are stupid or another Atlantean disagrees with their approach. Or whatever reason history provides.\n\nSo my questions are.\n\n1) What aspects of advanced tech would you like to see that I haven't included. \n\n2) How do you think someone whos at least 10,000 years old and enhanced would think? Would their personal philosophy lean towards extremism over time or perhaps apathy?\n\n3) What sort of cultural pressures do you think would cause such an accelerated technological growth in a society at a time when agriculture was considered new.\n\n4) How would someone so advanced behave with people throughout history? I kind of love having them take up roles of famous people throughout history and have everything they've done be wildly misinterpreted. \n\n5) Could having nano-machines integrated in yourself have some fun effects? Could you run a mesh under your skin as a form of armor? I kind of love the idea of one of them being executed but having an axe unable to break their skin. \n\n6) What is possible to an individual with an advanced AI in their head in modern times?\n\n7) What do you think gene editing yourself consciously would feel like?\n\n8) Please hit me with anything you think could be helpful.

Currently we walk around with almost no insight into the real-time details of underlying biological processes occurring in our system. Sure, we have some basic wearables that measure heart rate etc. What if we could monitor in real time what populations of neurons are firing, what genes are being expressed/regulated, notice if DNA damage is occurring, etc?\n\nI’m imagining you’d have the ability to turn on/off the monitor as needed.
