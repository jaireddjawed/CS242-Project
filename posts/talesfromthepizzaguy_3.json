        "text": "So I've been working at a small local chain for 3 months now, long enough to get to know everyone in the restaurant really well. We're located in a remote town that's basically in the middle of nowhere. We deliver to 6 towns in total. Of course there's a few well populated areas, but a lot of the land around here is secluded woodland or farm country.\n\nI must say, driving down those pretty backroads and enjoying the scenery is great, especially during susnet. It's even better when you're listening to music and smoking a joint. It's a great time for me to be alone and appreciate the scenery I'm surrounded by, all while contemplating life and enjoying a nice high. What's better is that because the towns are so small, I even have friends smoke me up on deliveries, and it only takes an extra 3-4 minutes, no more than a gas stop and really an inconsequential amount of time for a small business like us. And, of course, getting smoked up means I'm not always paying for new weed.\n\nDoes anyone else experience this? I know around here, smoking on deliveries is somewhat common among the drivers at the two local pizza joints that deliver. It might sound minute, but really just enjoying the wonderful scenery at night while smoking a J and playing my music is a wonderful experience, and I get PAID to do this every night! ",

        "text": "So the majority of my posts are just sort of negative stories (made in a lighthearted manner, but still), but idk I feel the need to post a positive story.\n\nSo a while ago our store was in the fucking shitter. It wasn't too bad when I first started, but then the GM kind of had a \"I can't live my life like this\" moment and just quit. After this, we were kinda fucked. We didn't really get another GM for a while, so one of the shift leads was made to do the GM stuff. Our Area Coach was no help either, and actually made it HARDER because she didn't let the interim GM do hiring (but then got mad when he hired nobody). Employees had a really bad case of \"I can't stay past 10 but I never put it in my availability so I'm just gonna get pissed when you schedule me to close\" or \"I'm going to call off every other day\". It was essentially me running the store with another driver.\n\nA few months later, we got a new General Manager. She'd had like 15+ years experience in the industry working at various stores, and sort of got thrown to our store to save it.\n\nThe first month was still hectic. We lost a LOT of people for various reasons. However, none of these people were particuarly... GOOD. We fired a CSR who begged for more hours but always ditched, we fired a Manager with a hell of an alcohol problem, a driver who we suspect stole a fuckton of money, and just some other shitty college kids that had a habit of \"never showing the fuck up\"-itis. \n\nIt sort of culminated by me sort of breaking down in tears as I was forced to work a sunday shift entirely by myself. Because of the issues with staffing, I'd spent the last 4 sundays working 14 hour shifts. I was in my 2nd semester of grad school at the time, and I was getting behind on homework because i literally had no time to do homework. The other driver just... didn't show up, and our wait times were 3 hours. People just kept on ordering, the orders didn't stop. I set up an interview with Domino's and told my boss I was quitting. She practically begged me to not quit and just sent me home and told me not to worry.\n\nSlowly but surely things started getting better. We hired a bunch of drivers that actually showed up for things. By March, we were doing good. We had an AM, all of the old management was gone (minus 1 who was the newest manager and didn't really have any issues), all of our drivers were reliable, I didn't have to keep worrying about who would and wouldn't show up, and it was smooth sailing.\n\nThese past few weeks things seemed to have fallen apart.\n\nA bunch of drivers and all but 1 cook quit (Nothing really BAD. 2 wanted more hours at their other job, 1 got accepted to school somewhere far away, 1 moved back home, and 1 had his car break down like 5 times so my boss fired him), and 2 drivers had pre-scheduled long-term vacations planned. We were essentially fucked beyond belief, and I took the stress very seriously. I was ready to have to do some crazy bullshit to save the store again.\n\nMy boss kept on telling me to not stress out, and that it wasn't my job to worry, and that it was her job. I felt especially bad since I needed 4 days off over the weekend, so it made her job even harder.\n\nThe days keep moving as she's telling me that nobody is applying to the store.\n\nSuddenly, we hire a new person.\n\nHe didn't show up on his second day after asking everyone \"yo r u working tomorrow im working tomorrow\" so we fired him. I personally would have given him a second chance but meh I'm not the boss.\n\nSo we hired another person. Who worked for a total of 3 days, before an old lady rammed into her car (no serious damage), and then her brakes stopped working.\n\nAnd then we realized... two of our drivers were developing a very particular kind of flu. The kind of flu that conveniently only appears for a single day with no symptoms. But we couldn't really fire them because, well, we were already fucked.\n\nI was stressed out as fucking shit but then\n\nThen randomly I get a text from my boss.\n\n\"You're training someone tomorrow\"\n\nI train him. He's really good. Next day\n\n\"You're training another person tomorrow, also I have 2 more interviews coming up\"\n\nI train her. She's really good.\n\nThen new girl who I honestly expected to quit comes back with fixed brakes.\n\nThen my boss shows me 3 more applications on top of the 2 that she mentioned before.\n\nAnd suddenly things are looking really fucking stellar.\n\nSure, we'll be kind of overstaffed when the 2 other guys come back from vacation, but there's only 1 way to deal with overstaffing.\n\nCue the people that continue developing the \"short-term flu.\" I don't think I'll be seeing them much after next week.\n\nPlus I work in a college town so we NEED more employees once school starts.\n\nSo I'm writing this to say thank you to my boss, who was able to save our store against all odds and really put my mind at ease. The secret to a good store isn't just good employees and a good location, but good management that can solve any crisis that is put in front of them. She constantly would thank me for everything I did (covering shifts, not having days off, double-checking her schedule to make sure any issues were fixed before they actually happened, etc), but I never really got a chance to thank her for what she did in such great detail, so hopefully this expresses that enough.",

        "text": "As a driver for the Hut, I've had my fair share of fuckups leading to a bad outcome in a delivery...cold pizza, knocking on a random door a block over for 3 minutes before calling a confused customer who is sitting outside...\n\nTonight I ordered BiteSquad to bring some food from a brewery a few miles away to the nerd game store where I was running nerd games for my nerd game group. I ordered around 4:15, app said expect delivery around 5:20, which is fine. They don't have the restaurant start cooking till they have a free driver so it should only be about 10 minutes from pickup to drop off.  I pretipped 5 for the driver and 2 for the staff at the brewery. \n\n Eventually I check the app around 5:20 and I see that the driver has my food. He got it at 5:12. The app has a tracker so you can see pretty close to real time where they are, and I am surprised to see that he is totally unmoving, in a parking lot on the other side of the main road from the restaurant.  This remains the same until about 5:35 or so when he suddenly starts moving, but now he's on the wrong side of the road and needs to wait for a left turn at a long light. \n\n   Eventually I refresh and I see he's in the parking lot of the shopping center where I am. Then I notice he leaves it again, and ends up on a nearby road on the next corner up where he turns around and has to do 2 more lefts to get back in. Then 3 more minutes while he putters around the parking lot looking for the store I clearly named in my special instructions. Finally he pulls up and I see he's got a woman in his passenger seat, no uniform, similar age. Dudes delivering with his wife in the car.  I'd bet he had her picking up food for them while he grabbed my order and she had to wait.\n\nThen he pulls my food out of the nifty little insulated carrier they give them and says sorry he's never been here before. I asked him if he'd ever been to this city before.  Then turns out he put my cold salad on top of my hot entree so my salad is now warm on the bottom and the entree box and food is soggy as fuck with congealed sauce.\n\nI ended up complaining and getting a 5 dollar credit and withdrawing my driver tip.\n\nAnyone else in the industry had bad service where you could easily infer what happened? Were you unforgiving like me, or do you just write it off?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/95wh0d/i_spent_three_years_climbing_the_ladder_from/",
        "text": "As said above, I worked for the 11th largest pizza chain in the country on and off for three years. I started as a driver and was damn good at it. I loved all of my coworkers, and for a long time the management was fantastic. Transparent, with open communication and clear reasons for every decision that was made. Our old GM, let’s call her K, was great at her job and extraordinarily passionate. She had been there since she was 16 and had spent 10 years busting her ass to make sure the store ran smoothly. Then in December of last year it all went to shit. \n\nOur owner calls an emergency meeting and tells us the store’s been sold. It’s a shock to all of us, including my GM. Within 24 hours, the new owners come in and essentially tell K that she’s been doing everything wrong and we’re going to need to make some drastic changes. Within two weeks, half of the old management staff is gone. Including K, who stepped down from her position, and then quit soon after. In comes A. \n\nA is one of the most headass motherfuckers I’ve ever met. He started around the same time I did but worked his way up to management faster (I was told by my old GM this was only because I had come and gone a couple times, which is fair.) so at a (very) young age, and as one of the only managers left and someone who kissed the new owner’s asses from the moment they walked in the door, A is promoted to GM, and things turn into a god damn shitshow. \n\nA is sporadically motivated. A rarely shows up to his shifts on time. A attempts a romantic relationship with two drivers, succeeding at one for a short time and does things like stand in the back with her doing dishes on Fridays and Saturday nights instead of working the line or answering phones. A and this driver both like reptiles, so on their own time one day A and driver go to a reptile expo and A buys a lizard. A lets it out in driver’s car (as one does, of course). The lizard crawls into the dashboard of driver’s car, resulting in her having to take the car to a shop and get half the engine removed to get the poor thing out. It’s dead when it comes out of the car. \n\nA frequently makes it the whole store’s problem when he doesn’t get his managerial bonuses, and talk to the employees like they’re idiots. A moves the store around during business hours instead of working the line. He acts insecure, and no one is allowed to question or have even slight problems with his decisions or his management style. A defends the new owner’s desire to short topping measurements, not to recommend customers cheaper deals, and to fire any employee who speaks out in even the smallest instance. A supports the new owner’s tendency to make arbitrary, garbage decisions without explaining to anyone what their reasons are.\n\nDespite this, I foolishly thought that working my way up to management would be able to help move things in the right direction. I wanted to bring back the transparency. I wanted to help build a better relationship between employees, management, and the new owners, and eventually I was promoted, and I worked hard. \n\nI went in two hours before open every time I opened, working for free to make sure a good portion of my dough and prep work were done. I cleaned more thoroughly than any other closing manager on my closes to make sure opening the next day was as easy as possible. I developed the relationship with my employees I wanted to, a good relationship that was friendly but firm when it needed to be. I worked the line with minimal help on weekends, especially from my GM, who would see full screens and say “it’s only 5 orders, you can handle it.” Yeah, 5 orders with 5 pizzas and two breads each, dick. \n\nThis work was appreciated for a while, but I also spoke out. I questioned new decisions made by upper management. I asked my boss why we were making the changes we were “less dough for him in the mornings, more for us. Less menial labor for us, more “paperwork” for him (he was writing scripts for youtube videos). It was safe to assume that if he was making a change, it would be less work for him, more for us. \n\nHalf the management staff was looking for new jobs. I had interviews lined up and my eye on the door. Then last week I went on vacation, camping in the woods. I was in the middle of nowhere with garbage service so I left my phone in my tent for a while. I come back to it later with a message from one of my drivers asking if I got fired. She said she heard it from another driver. My service is bad so I text my GM from my girlfriend’s phone and he confirms I was fired. \n\nBut hey, I have a second interview for another management job making more money in about two hours. So hopefully it buffs out. Fuck that store, and fuck GM\n\ntl;dr I found out from a delivery driver, who heard from another driver, while I was on vacation, that my garbage GM fired me. ",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/95rzzi/i_deliver_through_a_small_midwestern_chain/",
        "text": "I always see horror stories about delivery drivers working in chain pizza places and how horrid  some of these places are but I thought I’d share some of my insight/stories about how I’ve managed to make a living wage off of slangin pizzas.\n\nSo we are a standalone store that is located just outside the twin cities and is a franchise. Normally, our restaurants/banquet halls are attached to a hotel or something but the place  I’m at is it’s own entity which sort of makes in unique in its own way. \n\nSo we do dine in, delivery, carry out, and catering. Ever delivery has a $3 delivery fee and we have a 10 mile range around our store. Some orders have $25 minimums in case they live far away. We also only deliver during lunch and the evening. (11am-2pm, and 4pm-10pm)\n\nSo this means no matter what, I am always guaranteed a $3 tip, I can’t really be “snubbed” but a snub would basically be no tip on a $80+ order. \n\nAs an aside, most people I deliver to are rich white people. Our town is pretty gentrified but I would say more often than not it’s wealthy people ordering delivery or working class people. I’ve also delivered to section 8, and low income apartments and almost everyone there are actually fairly nice and genuine people. I try not to be judgmental of people’s financial situations and what not because I’d rather be humble and thankful for the fact that these people are helping me make a living and not take these things for granted.  \n\n\nSo on a busy night I’ll average anywhere from 15-20 deliveries and I’d say the average tip is anywhere from $5-10. I report credit card tips for taxes, and cash is rarely claimed. I get $6.25/hr as a driver. \n\nMy last shift I worked, (Monday) I made $128 closing from a 4-10 shift. So that’s nearly $25 an hour over a 6 hour shift. I would say working the night is more consistent in deliveries compared to the day. However,  during the day we usually have one or two big catering orders. \n\nI’ve delivered $1200 worth of food before and made nearly a $200 tip from it. I’ve taken hundreds of dollars of food only to get nothing from it, \n\nThere are downsides to this type of work.  Like the inconsistencies in between busy rushes and downtime. It also puts a strain on your car if your constantly driving. \n\nHow do you guys fair with delivery? Not everyone is in the same environment as me, I’d like to be curious about other parts of the world that do delivery. \n",

What's the story here, you may be thinking. The kicker is, John isn't a new driver for our store. He's just here to learn the ropes.\n\nSee, we are a training store. When someone needs to be trained to be a manager, they get sent to us. We almost always have someone getting trained, and at this moment, it is John.\n\nWhy am I telling you this story about John? Because John isn't learning to be a driver and he isn't learning to be a manager, either. He is NPC's new top guy over the central region! \n\nTalk about pressure! Never trained any one, but get to show the newest VP what driving is like. It went well. He seems like a good person.\n\nHe's since spent a few days in store doing other hands on activities. I think it's great that he's working the trenches to help him understand the company. He is in no way new to operating large franchises (including PH), be he lacked experience at the customer/employee level. \n\nTL:DR I trained the new VP of PH to drive.\n\n",

That is the only discount we get, UNLESS I'm missing something. \n\nI can't seem to get or find any other discount for any other food items on the Pizza Hut menu unless I'm looking at the wrong place. \n\nThis came to mind when I told my friends I got a job at Pizza Hut and they asked if I could get discounts on Pizza and Wings for us. I told them yes, but in reality, I am not entirely sure.",

Apparently a concerned citizen called in just after I left, and my manager was just waiting for me to notice. We remade the pizza and I made the drive of shame back up the freeway... no tip, rightfully so. We never found the other bag either, we figured maybe some homeless dude picked it up and had a nice (if a bit mangled) lunch.\n\n\nIt's definitely not the worst time I've fucked up, but I'm cringing just thinking about all the folks in our dining room watching me drive off with the bag up there... And I thought I was so cool with my tunes and my new tires and freshly washed car. Shit. ",

I work for a non-corporate (thank the gods) pizza joint in a very scummy/poverty ridden city on the outskirts of LA. This one just happened tonight:\n\nI’m walking in from a delivery and notice one of the local bums wheel chairing himself in the parking lot, he’s seems kinda drunk- typical. He ends up coming in and I give him his walk-in (err.. wheel in) order for wings where he mumbles some gibberish. “Say that again?”, “why can’ts Pokémon plays hide n seek?”, “because they’re stuck inside Pokeballs?!”, “they Pikachu!” And then wheels himself out. Apparently he then complained to a co-worker that his wings were pink, so we throw in another 10 piece well done. I’m the lucky lad to be closest to the register when he comes in for that so I grab em and attempt to hand them to the guy. This fool can’t grab the box and he pulls a bunch of menus off the counter attempting to lift his arm. It’s at this point I realize this bum is blasted on heroin, eyes bouncing around his skull, can barely hold his head up, slurred speech, big goofy smile. Haha I laugh to myself and ask him if he wants another ranch and hook him up, no biggie it’s just entertainment for me. I hand him the goods and he says something along the lines of “I’m sho shorry I’m nots feelshing too goods”, I’m like “yeah man I feel it, we’ve all been there” he’s like “I haves bladder infection”. I notice this guy is reeking of urine baddd and and step into the lobby to help him out the door. “Jesus sir you need to leave the store! You’re urinating yourself!” There’s a goddamn puddle in the lobby  soaking the menus he pulled off. He throws this rag he has onto the puddle and I wheel his ass out like no way this is happening... Thankfully some coworkers were willing to clean it since I took care of the bum. \n\nLater when I’m taking the trash out I notice a lot of the bums are fucking on one (there’s a group of 10-20 at all times congregated in our parking lot). I fist bump a smiling shirtless bum with a shopping cart who spoke absolute nonsense to me, I see another star-fished shirtless in the grass, and others wandering ecstatically. My theory is they passed around a new batch tonight and were all on cloud 9. Bums be peaking!",

His address I wrote down was 5735 55 street as an example. \n   So pizza is cooked and I go to deliver it and the freaking address DOESN'T EXIST!!  Now I know this cat wanted pizza as I didn't think he was messing around so I called a more experienced driver and relayed what was happening.   He figured out that the address was 5735 65 street instead.   I must have heard it wrong.   So I drive to the address and sure enough, front door is open and lights are on. \n    I knock on the front door.  Twice.   No answer.   I'm stuck with 2 pizzas I already paid for if I can't get rid of these so I open the door and yell inside\" HELLO!  YOUR PIZZA IS HERE!\".no answer..... walked in..... constantly repeating that their pizza is here... I went up the hall to the kitchen and living room. Still no answer.   Start heading towards the bedrooms, only one light on in only one room.... I walked to that room still hollering out that I'm here for their pizza.   No answer.   I get to the bedroom door and look in at some dude with his pants around his ankles, laying on the bed with his hand on his schlong.  Apparently after he had hung up the phone on me, he needed to pleasure himself.  That was awful to see. \n    He had the money on the end table by his bed.

Usually the gate guard calls the resident to confirm that they ordered pizza if the resident hasn't already called the gate guard to let them know, but their policy is that the gate guard can't call residents after 11pm. So I call the number myself on the delivery slip, twice, but no one answers. I've been at this gate for five minutes now. The gate won't let me in so I drive back to the store. As I walk into the store one of the insiders is on the phone. It's the customer that I was trying to deliver to. I take the phone and explain to them what happened. She said she didn't receive any phone calls. I check her phone number on the caller ID and it's one digit different than what is on the order. It was her mistake since it was an online order. She entered the wrong phone number. She realizes I'm very annoyed and she apologizes several times and I tell her that I will re-deliver the order to her, but it may take a little longer. I wait around to see if there is another order I can take near to her address so I can make it a double, but all the orders are going in the opposite direction. So I just go and deliver her order. The gate lets me in this time because I told her to call the gate and let them know I was coming. I get to her place, I'm noticeably upset, she apologizes again, I make the transaction, and she tips me $1.17. This one delivery was 16 miles total, 40 minutes, problems that were all out of my control, and all she gave me was $1.17. When I get back to the store there were 2 orders near her neighborhood ready to be delivered. The thing that made it worse was that she was really really cute. Like top 5 among all the customers I've had. It made it hard to be angry at her. Damn it.",

I am burned out, pissed off, and beyond fed up. \n\nFirst be careful this job can really screw you up physically.  Two months of my time on this job was on workman's comp for breaking my wrist.  An unpleasant daily reminder that will hopefully eventually go away. Make sure you have good shoes and when in doubt go slow.\n\n\n Try to find out how bad the management is at your store before you start this can make all the difference.  I have watched the store I work at descend from nightmare to beyond hell level.\n\nThis job is not for people who take pride in their work unless maybe you get lucky and have good management. If you work hard your coworkers will take advantage and leave you to do all the work.  They will hide from the phones and expect someone else to get it no matter what they are doing.  Most importantly try to find a place without smokers they tend to be the laziest, in this profession at least. \n\nAttendance, also not important. Find a bad store if you do not like showing up and you won't every really get in trouble.  In fact if you find a manager who likes you they will continuously make excuses for you. Also there is not benefit for being reliable.\n\nExpect to never get a break on this job unless you are lazy, see above. Also do not expect to leave when you are supposed to it will either be earlier or later.  \n\nAll in all with the injury I can say this is the worst job I have ever had. Maybe with a good manager the job could be better but given the pay rate for managers I see the good ones being few and far between.  The money isn't bad on average but the cost is high. \n\n\n\nEdit: So for those who disagree I have a few questions.\n\n1. Do you like your management team?\n\n2. Do you make minimum wage and have you ever gotten a raise?\n\n3.If you have worked in multiple chains or local places what did you like or dislike about them? \n\nEdit 2:\nIt sounds like people who had a better experience either had good management or were at much busier stores.  Alot of comments say you spend most of your time in the car.  Maybe that makes all the difference. At my store it was usually about 50/50  in store and driving.  I'm curious what the average is.\n",

Can you not wait 20-30 minutes after you get home for pizza? Then there are those other people who order delivery and know they won't be home but ask to leave it on the front porch and collect the cash that they leave out or add a tip yourself on the CC slip. I don't mind this because it doesn't waste any of my time. Actually it's faster than if they were home. But I don't understand why they would want cold pizza instead of just ordering it later. ",

        "text": "For ~6 months I've been a driver for a major international chain that specializes in delivery and carryout. I work in a medium-large Midwestern town. Last night about 10 minutes outside if town there was a country music festival that brought people in from all over the Midwest. \n\nLast night not once, not twice, but **three** times I would get an order for delivery to a hotel and then get there only to find they were not at their hotel yet and were still 10-15 minutes away (found this out by calling them). The first time I waited in the lobby for a little before leaving, but after that I just left immediately. \n\nWhy do people think it's okay to waste our time, gas, money, and wear on our cars like this? On all of them we left the order as a delivery so they had to pay the delivery fee even though they ended up picking it up. \n\nEdit: some people are commenting about a 45 minute wait time being the default at their places so that's what people expect. We're a pretty slow store business wise, so our expected time is 20-30 minutes. I was the one who answered the phone and took the order for all of these people. All of them were the only orders on the board at the time, so minimal delivery time, which I told them. ",

Unfortunately, I can't seem to find any good info on currently operating unions! I remember at one point around 2015 or so some folks from a union dropped by and left some contact info, but I never followed up, and wikipedia reports that \"In the United States, two labor unions have been formed specifically for pizza delivery drivers: the now-defunct [Association of Pizza Delivery Drivers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Pizza_Delivery_Drivers) (APDD) and the [American Union of Pizza Delivery Drivers](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=American_Union_of_Pizza_Delivery_Drivers&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1) (AUPDD)\".  Seems to me like both are defunct.\n\nSo, any information (or opinions) on unionizing in 2018? Was anybody here a part of APDD or AUPDD and willing to share thoughts on what worked and didn't work with those organizations? Seems like there are a lot of drivers here on this reddit...this could be a good place to organize, or at least compare and contrast our working conditions.",

None of this was with any real \"training\", more the manager barking orders at me now and then. Lol it was no big deal though, my other job is very high stress so this felt easier.\n\nI might have fucked up during the course of this. I took a ladies money and I'm 90% sure I washed my hands afterwards, but its possible that I didnt. My mind was on a ton of things. I wasnt on food service then, but we have to be doing something at all times. I made some bread bites while waiting on customers, and then washed my hands to return to stickers/counter. Around this time a woman approached me and said something about \"eating while making pizza is unsanitary\". There was no eating, so I can only assume that she might have seen my food/money potential fuckup. About 5 minutes later someone called asking for a manager and shortly thereafter I was sent home (but told to come back tomorrow).\n\nIs it normal to only work a few hours for your first day? Did I get myself fired? I'm still pretty sure I washed my hands, but maybe I'm just being paranoid. \n\nThis is my first food service job if you cant tell. ",

        "text": "One of the first pieces of advice I was given when I started delivering was to keep a supply of plates, napkins, and other non-perishable items in my car in case the unexpected need for them presented itself. \n\nI mindlessly kept the supply in my trunk until a couple of years ago when I purchased a new car. I thought back and realized that I seldom needed these items and decided to just do without them moving forward. I didn't mind telling customers that these items (mostly plates, red pepper flakes, and parmesan cheese) weren't included unless specifically stated at the time of ordering, on the rare occasion someone asked. \n\nNo problems until this past week with two different encounters. And when I say problem, I mean customers that don't accept a simple no, and want to argue over something that isn't going to change. \n\nThe first guy comes into our restaurant and orders a couple of pizzas to be delivered to his hotel. This seems like an odd request to me because he chose to wait an hour for me to deliver the food instead of the 15 minutes it would require us to make them while he waited in the store, but I figured it was easy money. \n\nI get to the hotel and drop off the pizzas. He hands me $5 and I'm on my way down the hall, when I hear him call back to me, \"Did you put any plates in there?\"\n\n\"No sir, not unless it's requested when you order. I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"I told the lady that I was staying at a hotel. \"\n\n\"I can see that sir, that's how I was able to find you. However, we don't assume that because you're staying in a hotel, that you'll need plates with your order.\"\n \nHe kept a dumb look on his face as he retreated back into the hotel room. Honestly, if we provided plates and napkins with every order to a hotel, our costs would go through the roof. Roughly 70% of our business is to hotels and resorts. \n\nThe second encounter happened earlier this evening. I get to the resort and find the wrong room number has been provided. I call the number and hear someone in the unit next door remarking something about a phone going off and decide to take my chances knocking there. Sure enough, an elderly lady opens up door and exclaims her delight at the speed with which I was able to deliver her food. She calls her son in from the next room after realizing she doesn't have enough cash to cover the bill. He hands me exact change and then asks if I've got any red pepper flakes in my car. \n\nIn my head, I've already moved on from this delivery: stiff = minimal extra effort on my part. I tell the guy no, and know that even if I did I'd be making no effort to go retrieve him some. He doesn't like my answer though. \n\n\"Really? I figured you'd keep some in your car.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry if you were banking on that fact sir, but we're also banking on the customer being able to accurately convey what they'd like to be delivered.\"\n\nI then saw myself out. \n\nIf you know that you like something with your food, then I don't understand the difficulty in telling the people who are preparing your food that you'd like that item. I also understand that people forget, but that's also not something a quick phone call couldn't fix. The way he said it made it seem like his intentions the entire time were to wait until I arrived and test his luck, which just seems like a silly thing to do in my opinion. \n",

So, I got there around 5:55 to clock in and get my bank for change, since I am one of the drivers. \n\nThen just a short while after, one of the managers (that I don't think I have met yet) came to me and asked me do I want the day off. Then, I asked why. She said that currently, there are too many drivers that are scheduled to work right now. \n\nSo, me, that manager, and the rest of our team members started talking about this as they was doing their thing (dishes, cooking, etc). Apparently, some of the others was shocked about this too. One of the other drivers offered to let me take his shift for tonight but I told him to don't worry about it. Maybe next time.\n\nPart of me wanted to work that shift but part of me also did not want me to work that shift. I wanted to work tonight because obviously I would have gotten paid for it and I do not mind working nights, but I did not feel like taking that 30 minute drive home from this Pizza Hut while in the dark and super tired from doing deliveries. Like, I just legit stood there and talked to them for about 10 minutes thinking on if I should stay or go. I actually love this job.\n\nIn the end, I just decided to give the bank back to the cashier and clock out since I had a project due for my college class on tomorrow and stuff to do for my startup anyway, so I went home.\n\nNot sure who creates the schedule or how they create it, but it blows my mind as to how would they schedule that many drivers knowing that the shift may be full. My only theory behind this is the management at this Pizza Hut is not the best and/or because I am fairly new to this job. If I worked tonight, this would have been my 3rd day doing deliveries on my own and it would have been my 2nd night shift. Which I was okay with.\n\nBut anyways, has anything like this happened to you guys?",

This particular house I've never been to before but I pull into the driveway, get the order out, and ring the bell, nothing weird. \n\nAn older dude answers the door looking pretty upset for some reason, I give him his food then hand him a receipt to sign since he paid with a credit card. The dude looks at the receipt like it's written in a language he's never seen before and hands it back to me before walking away from the door into his kitchen without saying a word. \nStanding there pretty confused and uncomfortable I hear a female voice say, \"I got it\" then a woman, probably in her late 20s, walks up to the door and gives me the most fucked up, ripped $5 bill I have ever seen and whispers to me \"this is my weed money\". Okay? I'm thinking to myself but at this point I'm too weirded out to say anything so I just smile and laugh. I noticed her eyes looked saggy so she was probably baked as a snake but whatever. I walk back to my car when I'm about to get in the door flies open again and the girls runs out with 2 more crumpled dollar bills and says \"here's more money, use it wisely cause weed don't cost nickels and dimes no more\". \n\nThis was honestly the strangest interaction I've had on a delivery and I've been working for a little bit more than a year now so I guess I'm lucky in a way. But why was this one woman so persistent on letting me know that she smokes? I don't know pretty strange tbh, $7 tip from the weird potheads is cool by me though.",

I'd normally take it, but there's a ton of construction going on in his neighborhood that forces me to take an extra 20 minute (one way) detour.

        "text": "I work for a chain, and our delivery area is set by corporate. Recently they shrunk it a bit due to delivery times being so bad, and a lot of regulars had to order from somewhere else. However, a manager could allow us to deliver outside the new radius, and they'd have to personally adjust mileage. \n\nAnother driver took an order for a delivery outside our area, and he informed the customer that they weren't in our area but he was making an exception. I ended up taking the order, and when I got there, the customer was busy powerwashing her driveway. She signed the CC receipt, took the pizza inside, and went back to her work. She did not tip, so when she tried to order again a week later, the manager told her no. She launched into a tirade about how the manager was racist and she would be calling corporate. \n\nA while later, a manager took an order for a home in a fancy neighborhood, explaining they were outside our delivery area and she was making an exception. I took the order to the customer, they tipped 3 bucks, and I glared daggers at the Lambo in the driveway on my way out. Well, the customer decided her pizza was wrong and she needed to complain. Most people who complain call the store, ask to speak to the manager, and either get a remake delivered, some store credit, or both. Not this woman. She personally drove down to the store and made a huge scene in the lobby, screaming at the manager about how there was CHEESE on her pizza, and she ordered pepperoni, not pepperoni and cheese! The manager had to explain that cheese comes on pizza by default, and if you don't want it you have to ask to have it not be put on.  \n\nAfter that, the general manager banned us from taking any more orders outside our area since the manager from before had been driven to tears. That solved the problem for the most part, but customers are always looking for ways to cheat the system, and that's what this next guy did. \n\nThis guy lived on a road that goes through our area, but two miles outside it, deep inside another store's territory. The customer was high as the moon, so when he ordered online, he put his apartment number instead of the street address, which the system interpreted as being in our area. He listed the name of the apartments on the ticket, so we knew where he was. I was up on the rotation to take it, but after looking it up on my GPS I refused because it was so far (and in a poor area), so I suggested we transfer it to the proper store. The manager said to go ahead and take it since his food was ready to leave, and I was overruled, so I told another driver to take it instead. Well, that customer wanted a remake, so as soon as the driver returned, he had to leave again, and he was NOT happy about that since it was at least a 15 minute drive one way with no traffic. But the guy was so high he actually tipped good, $7 the first time and $5 the second, so at least it was worth it for the driver. ",

        "text": "Had a shift last night which involved delivering to what is known around the shop as “The Hoarder House” which got me thinking about others experiences with them. \n\nFor back story I work for a pizza monopoly in Australia and in our area we have this one house that is definitely owned by a hoarder. The place is barely maintained (like theres a sort of trampled path to the front door because the only part of the front yard that’s mowed regularly is the council nature strip because it’s in a sort of suburban area), there’s piles of rubbish bags all throughout the home and it reeks, like comparative to the local tip bad when you get to the door. \n\nSo how I typically go about a delivery is to approach the front door, greet, read out the delivery, hand over said delivery (thankfully they pre pay for the order so no mucking around with change), ask if they’d like the receipt (best part is them feigning thinking about whether or not they’d like the receipt, which for all ~6-8 deliveries they’ve kept) then get out of there in as inoffensive manner as I can, all while forcing a smile to not gag from the smell. \n\nAs an aside, there’s technically 2 hoarder houses in our area however the second one only orders maybe once a month and typically meets you at the gate (somewhat rural area, 5-10acre blocks sort of thing) where you can’t get a good look into the house and it’s piles of rubbish. Like to think of it as a really crappy IRL easter egg as I’m not sure if anyone/many other people have delivered to their front door and not the gate.\n\nSo I was just wondering whether many other places have (or places similar to) them and what sort of reputations they have.",

He yells to me and tells me to come inside which threw me off a bit but I obliged as this type of stuff doesn’t really bother me or creep me out HOWEVER as I step inside he proceeds to shut the door behind me and lock it with a key which he then puts into his pocket. Guys when I say I almost shit my pants I mean it. He had a murder television show on, an unbelievably messy home, and several large knives on the walls. This guy then wanders around a bit mumbling to himself and after a couple minutes signs my receipt, tips me $5 and let’s me out a different door in the back of his house. I really couldn’t tell you what he was thinking, but the whole time he was wandering I was planning my escape. Creepiest delivery I’ve ever taken! \n\nWhat are the creepiest deliveries y’all have taken?",

        "text": "Did my first ever delivery yesterday, then immidately had to start taking double orders with one trip. Every drive I'd have to drive to two separate apartments usually 6-10 minutes apart.\n\nWe were only staffed all day with 2 drivers, including me. 90% of my orders on my 9 hour shift were apartments.\n\nNeedless to say I was like a fish out of water! I don't know how to use the phone and computer pizza prep system well, I don't know the area, I had trouble finding most rooms at the apartments, and I had one really weird customer experience.\n\nSo basically on one of my last orders, I was on my second delivery of the trip, and I could not for the life of me find this guy's apartment. The complex was not lit up, I couldn't read the building or apartment numbers, and there was no map to guide me because this complex was just built.\nI was very late. I couldn't call him because the receipt had a printing error on some parts.\n\nSo I'm running up and down three flights of stairs on every building until the customer walks out looking for me, and whistle me over. I say \"hello I'm so sorry for the inconveniences, I couldn't seem to find your apartment.\" The guy ignored me, gave me a dirty look, and didn't speak to me the whole time. I shuffeled around and gave him his stuff in a desperate fashion (lol).\n\nFinally I need him to sign my receipt, and I lose my pen for the first time. The guy starts tapping his foot while I run to the car and still can't find it. I say \"you know what that signature is for my own copy, let's not worry about it. Have a good day sir.\" Ok! He finally speaks as he turns around and walks away then says \"you know what? Actually I'll sign it for ya walks back over to me, takes the receipt, goes all the way back up to his apartment and comes back down with a pen.\n\n\"Thank you for being patient with me sir I really appreciate it.\" He then walks down, signs it in front of me, and i see that under the \"add tip\" line he put one single dollar. \n\n\"Thank you again sir\" as he turns around and walks away without another word. Idk if he did this to spite me, or if he thought he was a hero for tipping the shittiest delivery of his entire life.\n \nNot gonna lie, I strait cried a tiny bit in the drive back. I didn't eat but a finger nail tip that entire day lol, musta been stressed.\n\n",

My only issue with it being my first week is that, I don't have a good process set in stone yet and thought maybe I could get some advice from more seasoned drivers from the reddit community. Not really sure if this subreddit is meant more for stories or not though.\n\n\\-\n\nMy main issues are getting in and out of the car, those few precious seconds that can easily turn into minutes.. what do you guys do to make it easier and quicker? Some of my coworkers leave their phones in the car so they don't have to pull them out of their pockets constantly, I've opted for a half apron to hold my phone, bank, cheese and peppers, and pens even. My phone overheats and I'm not very trusting to leave my phone out in open view, especially in some of the neighborhoods I go to.\n\nI've also learned that I'm just short enough it makes it difficult to pull the hot boxes out with me through the driver side, so I pull my seat back a click or two while I'm on the clock.\n\nWhat's the easiest way you've figured out to pull the pizza's out of the hot bags? Sometimes I feel like I need three hands, and I've almost dropped a couple orders of wings and/fries.\n\nWaze or GMaps? How do you have your phone set up while you're on the clock?\n\nWhat do you guys hold your banks in? I use a half apron for now, a coworker uses a fanny pack pouch, and another uses a zippable coin purse/wallet thing.\n\n\\*\\*Edit: I forgot to mention, I use a clipboard.. mainly cause I suck at counting money, and it has a calculator on it, holds pens and extra cheese and peppers which allows me to let the customer not only get a new pen, if the one I hand them isn't working but it also lets them snag as many packets as their heart desires. I've been looking at waist packs that hold clipboards in them because it makes things bulky at times, but still gets positive compliments regardless because I'm the only one in my area that brings one along.",

        "text": "During summers while I was in college, I worked as a delivery driver for a particular pizza establishment. During the actual school years, I myself relied on certain food establishments for late-night food delivery while I was studying. Even as a relatively poor college student, I always tipped the delivery guys 10 dollars (or more, if my budget was doing well at the moment), because I understand the struggle. I would like to thank delivery drivers for the following things:\n\n1. Dealing with unreasonably impatient customers \n\nMany customers absolutely LOVE to complain about every little thing. \"It took 45 minutes to get my food! I want a a refund!\" Yeah? How about you learn your place? Have you ever worked a damn day in your life? I hope y'all have managed to deal with that stuff without much difficulty.\n\n2. Traffic\n\nMy God -- traffic was sometimes unbelievable for me. If you've been late to a delivery because of traffic, don't feel bad! It isn't your fault.\n\n3. Customers who lie for free stuff\n\n\"I ordered an extra sauce cup worth 50 cents! I want a full refund on my 60 dollar order!\" Actually, sir, you didn't order an extra sauce cup -- and it wasn't OUR mistake, because you ordered online rather than over the phone. \"Screw you! I did! I know I did! I want to talk to your manager!\" \n\nThese customers appear every once in a while.\n\n4. Weather\n\n\"Why did it take you an HOUR to get here?\" Well, sir, there is 5 feet of snow on the ground. \n\nSometimes, weather makes delivery insanely difficult. Certain customers don't understand that (often despite the fact that they specifically ordered delivery as opposed to carryout because they weren't willing to drive in the snow).\n\nIn summation, delivery driving is often a rough job. I've done it myself, and I've also depended on delivery drivers when I've been hungry. I thank you all for the work you do, and I hope the tips that I have given are generous!\n\nP.S.: If any customers wish to comment on this post and refute what I've said, go for it! Just know that I won't take you seriously!",

        "text": "Mobile user so sorry for formatting\n\nFor some background, I work at Daddy Racist's Pizza, and it covers about a 6 mile radius, so we get a lot of customers of various socioeconomic groups. Tips vary widely, but most of the time we get $2+ in the less expensive areas, but most tips are around $4 or $5. This will be important later. \n\nMost of the things I'm going to complain about are fine, when there's only one or two issues. However when they check all the boxes, it's a problem. \n\nOne of the customers (IC for idiot customer from now on) I've had the misfortune of delivering too, is probably the worst customer I will ever have to deal with, for many reasons. The first reason is that he tips a whole dollar. One single dollar every delivery, without fail. He doesn't live in a bad area either. He lives in a gated community (more on it later). \n\nIC is also a regular, as in he orders a pizza everyday. So not only do you waste a potential good tip, you could also get him multiple times a week (2 of my last 3 shifts I delivered to him). Normally, I love regulars. They're people you can talk to and can count on giving a good tip. \n\nRemember how I said IC lives in a gated community? Well the whole points of the gates is to only let in people who you want to be in there. So to be sure you want those people there, you give them a code. Problem is IC doesn't know the code. Ok no big deal, just call him and ask him to let you in or come out to get the pizza. He doesn't pick up the phone. Seriously I've called him twice on each delivery to him, and he's never picked up. I'm convinced he's too dumb to remember where his phone is. \n\nIC also clearly never learned basic manners. I'm pretty sure the only thing I've heard him say is \"Before you ask, I dont know the code. I live here and I dont know the code\" or some variation. Here's a suggestion: fucking ask someone. You live there, ask a neighbor, ask the people who run the place, ASK SOMEONE. For the love of God, do something to give the pizza place you buy from EVERYDAY something to help them out a bit. If he at least said \"thanks for waiting\" or something along those lines that might make it better, but he never says anything other than he doesn't know the code. \n\nI love my job, I make a lot of money and work with some cool people, but delivering to this asshole ruins my day everytime I see his address. Fuck you IC. Fuck you",

Sometimes this can mean that the doorbell doesn't work, so I knock. Still nothing. I repeat that process and after continued silence I call the number they left. They only left initials as the name on the order and it was something very basic like J.B. or K.C.. I left a message that I was a driver with x company and I was trying to reach whoever about their order because I was outside their house.I rang the doorbell again and when I got nothing I called the store and talked to the manager. \n\n\nAs I was speaking to him a light turned on in the house. I quickly said \"Woah, never mind. They're coming to the door\" and I hung up. An attractive woman in a bathrobe answered. I remember that she was speaking on her phone. She looked puzzled and said, \"I didn't order pizza.\" I double checked the address with her. She said it was the correct address but that she hadn't ordered a pizza. I mention the initials and she says it is not her. I tell her I'm sorry for the inconvenience and wish her a good night. \n\n\nAs I drive back to the store I get a phone call. It's my manager and he tells me that the customer called the store. He gives me a new address. I get there and the guy apologizes and tells me the woman I spoke to must have been his ex-wife. He used to live in that house and he forgot to change the address for on-line orders. Pizza Delivery is full of weird things like that. ",

        "text": "My first official day (minus the day for the training videos) as a Pizza Hut Driver was today. So far, so good. I really like it. There has been a few stuff that I had to do that I wish was mentioned in the job description, but I’ll get into that in a sec. I’m okay with washing dishes, mopping, folding boxes, etc. But I hate answering phones. \n\n——-\n\n**How to avoid answering phones?**\n\nI draw the line at answering the phone. Hell, I do not like answering my own phone most of the time unless it is someone that I am familiar with. \n\nSo far, me trying to avoid answering them has worked. For example, I usually fold 10 boxes at a time to make myself look extra busy when the phone rings so I do not have to answer, but someone else took the call. But does anyone else do this? How do you avoid taking phone calls if this applies to you as a driver?\n\n**How do you handle multiple tickets while on a delivery?**\n\nToday, was the ride along for me. It’s all good but I didn’t think about me having to possibly have more than one ticket during a single drive. She had 3 tickets that she had during my ride along. \n\n**What was your first delivery ALONE like?**\n\nIf I get my military ID tomorrow (aka Friday), then I will be fully able to take deliveries alone. For this Pizza Hut, drivers need a military ID to enter the base because the Hut is located near the military base in my city. So, military personnel and families that lives there too likes to order pizza. But besides that, I’m talking about in a general sense. What was your first alone delivery like?",

        "text": "**I wanted to share this moment from earlier this week:**\n\nI was out with two deliveries that were in office buildings next to each other.  Having arrived in the first office, I ask for the person who ordered.  I had my clipboard with both receipts out along with a pen.  Both receipts clearly have the customers name IN BOLD on them and highlighted to make it easier to find the name.  The customer walks over to me and the exchange as follows occurs:\n\nMe: \"I need you to fill out the receipt on your right, which has your name on it.  Your copy is in your bag.\"\n\nSaid customer proceeds to sign the wrong receipt while i am looking at their bag of food, and getting it out of the insulated bag.  As I hand said customer her food, she tries to take the receipt with her name on it, and give me the clipboard, pen, and receipt that was the other customers receipt.\n\nMe: \"Excuse me, but you signed the wrong receipt.  The receipt you are taking is my copy that I need signed.\"\n\nCustomer (As she signs the correct receipt):  I'm sorry, but that wasn't clear to me.\"\n\nMe (trying to be nice, but clearly frustrated): I'm sorry if I didn't make that clear.\"\n\nI got to the second customer, and explained the mess of my copy of her receipt.  Said second customer starts laughing, and has a few choice names for said first customer.",

Yesterday I was given a document when I showed up to work that told me that all 20 of the locations of the restaurant I work at will be switching to using a 3rd party delivery service for all deliveries under $100. This starts next Monday, so I have very little notice in terms of finding out another job. All the drivers will be insiders/counters now except for the occasion of an order over $100. \n\nHas anyone else had their job just spring something like this on them? Less than a week of notice seems really unfair. For the entire company to just cut out the main duty of a good fraction of their workers and give that work to random untrained 3rd party gig economy drivers is unacceptable.",

I went and got it and then came back. When I got back, the other worker which is one of the other drivers, was about to leave to deliver some pizzas (at least, that is what I assumed since she had pizzas in that container in her hand). And that is when I left too to go home because that is all I had to do. I was not needed anymore, until my ride-along on tomorrow. \n\nSo, all this brings me to the big question: Will I be bored doing this job? It just seems like there was nothing to do.",

He worked at a typical mom and pop suburban pizzeria (which had two locations: our town and the town next to ours). We're Indian. My brother has medium brown skin, but he has smaller facial features than the average Indian person, which is why few people mistaken him to be Saudian Arabian, Egyptian, etc. Due to this, people might think he is a Muslim as well. We are Indian and not religious\n\nMy brother was working at the location in our town. He delivered pizza to an old white man. While my brother was driving back to the pizza place, the old man called the pizzeria and the main worker (Not an owner or manager, but he was popular and great at managing the pizzeria) happened to answer it. The old man called and lied saying a brown guy delivering pizza peed on his landscape. The main worker believed it at first. My brother explained himself to the worker that it was a lie. Then, the worker banned the old man from having pizza delivered to his house. The pizzeria has a list of addresses and phone numbers to never serve.",

What's your gender, have you been asked to run errands for others, either work-related or a boss's personal errands and how would/do you feel being asked to stop somewhere \"right on the way\".  I'm okay with it once or twice from someone but if it becomes a pattern, I'll kindly inform them of UberEats, Postmates, or other apps to use in which people are being paid specifically for these things.  \n\nI've been asked to run to the convenience store a few times, twice by managers and once by a coworker in which they were short up to a dollar of what they asked me to get would cost.  The last time with a male manager bothered me  because he clearly waited until I got to work to ask me to do it, despite a male driver having been there all night.  \n\nAlso, I was stuck running to other shops for vegetables on my busiest night of the week a few weeks ago which ticked me off, and I told the manager working that night that under no circumstances would I be doing that again on that night.

However, I am ready to work tomorrow and I know that on tomorrow, I will at least be getting my Pizza Hut shirt and hat. \n\nRegardless when I start tho, what can I expect on the first day? What is life like as a driver? Stuff I need to get used to? Some of the other daily duties and clocking in/out? My list of questions can go on, but any tips for what to expect would be great. \n\nThanks! ",

Cost me $400, easy to work on, tons of cargo space, and deceptively quick with the 5 speed manual. Fuel economy isn't the best though (I average about 21), but with how little it cost me, that isn't that big a deal.\n\n2. My 1997 Toyota Tercel CE Coupe. Picked this up just under a month ago for $1500. Decent cargo room amd excellent fuel economy (I average 35 with this one). A bit slow, but it handles like a go-kart and has a short enough turning circle to easily navigate busy streets. \n\nI use the Tercel most days amd keep the Camry on standby for when I expect bigger orders or less traffic.\n",
