Women have been oppressed by theocracy for thousands of years. The women and men of the Free World must remain strong and maintain our democracy so we can continue to fight for those who have no rights.

That said, the current climate around sexual misbehavior has me thinking about my own behavior in the past. We‚Äôre not taking rape or serious assault here, but in high school I definitely took liberties with woman friends (butt grabbing, things like that) in attempt to be flirty, but now feel ashamed of now as an adult.\n\nMy question is: Is there anything I could/should do to address said behavior I now regret? Should I write to the women to apologize? Or would that do more harm than good? Any and all advice is appreciated.",

        "text": "I'm a college graduate with my bachelor's in criminal justice as well as psychology. I work in private security and have been making a concerted effort to be as physically lean and mean as possibly while also honing my forearm skills. \nI'm a serious candidate for a LEO position in a local small city. \n\n\n\nCut to a wedding I have to be in. High school friend is getting married, asked me to be her MOH. Cool, I can do that. All goes fine setting up her space for the reception, painted Mason jars in place, fake flowers and chocolates sprinkled on the tables. Then the BM strides in. \n\n\nEverybody's friend, quick with a joke, super helpful with a side of sass. Haven't met him until now.  Okay. Whatever, he seems a little \"try hard\" but whatevs. Night of rehearsal goes on and he's glued to my side making negging comments all night. \n\n\n\"It's good you're wearing flats tomorrow, you're too tall in heels. I hate women being taller than me\" \n\n\n\"Oh, *you're* going to be a cop?\" Looks me up and down painfully slowly before smirking disapprovingly. (He's a slightly heavier set cop from BFE. ) \"Really. Hmm.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh, you didn't buy me a drink? Kind of a shitty MOH, aren't you?\" When I went to get a drink at the bar. \n\n\n\n I was caught off guard and froze when he \"adjusted my necklace\" the first time without permission. Full on brushing up against my chest. He did this all night, me swatting his hands away and trying to keep things quiet and focused on my friend.  At one point it got to the degree of what the fuckery that another bridesmaid called him out.  \n\n\n\"IF YOU'RE GOING TO UNDRESS HER WITH YOUR EYES ALL NIGHT, AT LEAST BE SUBTLE. WE ALL SEE YOU BEING A CREEP.\"\n\n\nThe wedding party took shots bought for us by the BM. As the night went on there was quite a bit of alcohol so I made as good of choices as I could. I locked my car, put my keys in my purse, and let my sister (who lived three blocks away) know I was crashing on her couch. \n\n\nMind you, I'm not blackout. I don't drink that much. I'm just not safe to drive, but I'm pretty aware. Enter BM catching me trying to leave. \n\n\n\"Hey, where are you going?\" (Note, he wasn't with me two seconds ago. Where the fuck was he creeping from?)\n\n\n\"I'm leaving, I'll be back tomorrow for pictures.\" (Serious Fuck Off vibes)\n\n\n\"You've had a bit to drink, why don't you stay in my room?\" (Note: the bridal party has a suite if I'd wanted to stay)\n\n\n\"No, I'm not doing that. I'm going to my sister's. \" (He's ignoring my 'no' vibes and still getting closer with a wolfy grin)\n\n\n\"C'mon, I'll sleep on the couch. Stay in my room. \" Queue puppy dog eyes and getting WAY too into my space, touching my arm. Enter the bride. \n\n\nBride: \"What *the fuck* are you telling her? Go *away* BM!\" BM sulked away protesting that he was \"just looking out for me\".  The bride and groom walked with me to my sister's. \n\n\n\nFound out from the bride the next day the BM had taken bets with a groomsman that he could fuck me before the reception ended.\n\n\n\nI guess I just wanted to share this with a crowd that might get why I feel skeeved out, and a little shitty about myself.",
