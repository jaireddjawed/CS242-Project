Finally, once we start actually implementing tariffs, this other countries will no longer be able to freeload off of the US\n\n[Here's an article that goes into it](https://bigjolly.com/how-united-states-subsidizes-world/)\n\nAt a glance, the math does add up and I'm not sure how to counter this.

All selected comments are from their Kavanaugh megathread\n\n&gt; Democrats should let this one go. They look so desperate and push many independents to the polls. At this moment, Brett K confirmation is certain. They got nothing against him\n\n&gt; Am I the only liberal who thinks the correct answer here is still to confirm Kavanaugh? He is an objectively good judge. If the senate democrats somehow succeed in this quest to obstruct his nomination, won't we end up with Amy Coney Barrett instead? I'm a much bigger fan of Kavanaugh's writings than Barrett's.\n\n&gt; I have seen a recent trend by accusers and their supporters to label their accusations as \"credible\" without ever actually defining how or why the accusation is credible.\n\n&gt; If this exceeds the evidentiary basis for similar cases that were \"found to be very credible,\" I'm really curious about their definition of \"credible.\" Normally something's credibility is determined by the evidence in support of it, and that must have been basically zero in those previous cases.\n\n&gt; I don't think this is changing any minds, and more so, as a matter of procedure, I am at least onboard with the \"you need evidence, not just allegations\", otherwise this becomes the tactic of choice for both sides and literally nobody can be confirmed again.\n\n&gt; You have to admit, that this past week is destroying the national conversation like nothing ever seen. I bet this period is going down as the worst week of the Trump era. Worse than Sandy Hook.\n\n\n\n",

While I of course believe you can separate art from artist, I also do not think we should ignore the unfortunate realities surrounding creators we admire.  Simply put, Boots Riley is *not* the man you think he is.\n\nCase in point: [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acT_PSAZ7BQ) is the music video for the song \"The Guillotine\" by The Coup. As you can see, Boots portrays the Scarecrow character from the film *The Wiz*, an adaptation of *The Wizard of Oz*.  What is wrong with this exactly?  Well, early on in the video we see three actors playing Dorothy, the Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion approaching Boots.  *However*, as you can see in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dk3BfcWrx8c) clip, the Scarecrow is the first companion that Dorothy meets and so the inclusion of the Cowardly Lion and the Tin Man is completely inaccurate.\n\nI'm sickened to see so many of you supporting a man with no regard for canon.",

        "text": "So I've been working at an archive and doing primary research on [The Red Summer of 1919](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Summer). I came across a scrapbook kept by the governor of Arkansas during that time (because of his own involvement in the [Elaine massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elaine_race_riot)) and came across this editorial that was published in a Little Rock paper towards the beginning of 1919. \n\nIt reminded me of what they say about the Reading Series on Chapo, that these ghouls are worth paying attention to because you will see them tell on themselves. I'm obsessed with this stupid editorial because of how *reasonable* you can tell the author thinks he's being. Some of it is overt and vile white supremacy, but some of his arguments we still hear echoes of today, 100 years later, from our very own Flag Respecters, who think that black people should \"shut up and be grateful.\" It's all in here. Anyway, I've posted excerpts from this elsewhere in the sub, but I finally transcribed the whole godawful thing so it's in one place. For you. Here you go:\n\n*From Little Rock Daily News, Friday, May 16, 1919*\n[no byline]\n\n**RACE AGITATION**\n\n\nSome agitation started in New York is calculated to injure both the white and negro races in the south. These eastern negroes are starting a movement that is not needed and spreading propaganda that is misleading.  Here are the demands of the new organization: \n&gt;“A vote for every negro man and woman on the same terms as white men and women. \n\n&gt;An equal chance to acquire the proper kind of education. \n\n&gt;A fair trial in the courts for all crimes in which he is accused, by judges in whose election he had participated. \n\n&gt;A right to sit upon the jury which passes judgment upon him. \n\n&gt; Defense against lynching and burning at the hands of mobs. \n\n&gt; Equal service on railroad and other public carriers, including sleeping/dining and pullman cars. \n\n&gt; Equal right to use of public parks, libraries and other community services for which he is taxed. \n\n&gt;An equal chance for a livelihood in public and private employment.”\n\n\nThe propaganda is starting in Little Rock and other southern cities. It is not having wholesome effect, because the intelligent negro knows he is securing right now in the south all possible consideration as a citizen, and that the demands which are made by the eastern aggregation have already been granted as far as it is humanly possible.\n\n The negro has the ballot in this country and his vote is always counted as cast. Particularly is this so in Arkansas. He can’t vote in a Democratic primary election if he is not a democrat, but he votes in the general election, and his vote is given the same legality as a white man’s vote. \n\n* [“An equal chance to acquire the proper kind of] education,”* God save the mark! The negro child gets the same apportionment of the school tax as the white child; and notwithstanding the white man pays four-fifths of the school tax, it goes to the negro at the same per capita as to the white child.  Is that equal enough? \n\n*“A fair trial.”*  The fact that because of the negro’s status he is given more leniency than a white man is established in every southern section, and the negro lawyers in Little Rock are the best witnesses that they never have any fear of getting a fair trial in the courts of this country.  \n\n*“A right to sit on the juries.”*  There is nothing in the law that prevents a negro sitting on the juries; but there is much more in custom that will prevent it and there is more in sentiment that will forever prevent it.  \n\n*\"Defense against lynching and burning by mobs. \"* He has the same defense from that as any other citizen has, and he has the same protection in the south that he has in the north. This fact will be amply authenticated by the records of the two sections.  The surest safeguard the negro has against inhumanity and brutality is to desist from inhumanity and brutality himself. \n\n* “Equal service in dining, Pullman and sleeping cars:”*  The white man of the south is willing that he have all the service he is able to pay for and obtain.  But the southern white man will never consent to ride in Pullman, dining and sleeping cars with the Ethiopian. \n\n* Equal rights to use the parks, libraries and other community service for which he is taxed: * He has all the rights to parks on which he pays a tax.  The city government maintains a negro library now out of a special fund. There is no reason why the negroes of Little Rock may not enjoy their library. \n\n* “An equal chance for a livelihood in public and private employment:”*  This is a misleading demand.  There is no avenue of activity closed to the negro in this section. He engages in every trade, in every profession and industry in which the white man is engaged, and his rights and privileges are safeguarded by the same laws that safeguard the rights and privileges of the white man. \n\n Having disposed of these questions, the News sees in the propaganda that is being spread a demand for social equality and it wants to say that it is impossible and unthinkable.  The negro can no more dream of such a thing than the monkey of mating with the swan.  A law of nature cannot be repealed by a law of congress.  The negro is to the American social organization what a pound of putty would be in an angel food cake. It were as wise to make the crow and the turtle dove tenants of the same eyre as the white and black man social equals; as sensible to yoke Pegassus with a plow horse as to make the Causasian [sic] and the Afican [sic] co-rulers of the same country.  \n\nThe negro is here, the slave ships first sailed from New England ports, and the first slaves landed on New England soil. The sagacious men of that section are not to be blamed for wanting to get rid of a bad bargain, but they sold the negro to the southern white man and to that extent are responsible for his being here.  Up to the present we have gotten along better than any two separate and distinct races ever got along in the history of the world on the same soil; especially so when one is an alien and inferior race and the other the crowning glory of God’s handiwork.  \n\nWe have closed to the negro no avenue in which his feet are fit to tread. He is encouraged, aided and helped in every way by the white man of the south. To such an extent that this race, in slavery and servitude a brief generation ago have acquired farms and homes and property in the south, until today the negro who has been thrifty is a landlord instead of a tenant.  \n\nIn no other section on God’s footstool has ever an alien and slave race attainted to such dizzy heights as the Sambo of the sixties has attained in the land of his serfdom, in the home of his former master.  In “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,” he is absolutely unrestrained. In viciousness and lawfulness, he is restrained and God forbid there should ever come a day in this country when he is not so restrained.  He works side by side in the field and by the furnace with his former master, and his pay envelope Saturday night is often more bulky than that of the white laborer, because he is capable of doing more hard work.  The Almighty sends the same rain and sunshine to nurture and warm and water his crops, and the white man furnishes him his seed, his stock and the land whenever he wants these to promote the cultivation of the soil. \n\n On no other continent has ever a slave race risen to such place and respectability. \n But there is a line beyond which the negro never can go.  \nThere is a mark beyond which his black feet may never tread.  \nThere is a social circle in which his voice will never be heard.  \nThere is an aristocracy he can never reach.  \nThe God who fashioned and formed him of dust, had a different lump of clay to what went into the Causcassian [sic] making, and nature does not change. \n\nWe have nothing except the kindest and most tolerant sympathy for the black man in a black man’s place; to freedom and political equality we are glad to carry him; to citizenship and the higher life he has our co-operation. But into the life and home of the white man he will never enter; into the inner circle of the white man’s fireside he must never come except as a servant.  \n\nTo liberty and enfranchisement we have brought him; in education and civilization we have been his ever present help; in industry and man labor we have piloted him, but when he dares to cross the threshold of a white man’s home, whether that home is a lodge in the wilderness or a palace on Long Island, if he presumes to come on equality with the white man, he faces a shot gun at the very threshold, and that shotgun will always be kept loaded. \n\n Let the negro be satisfied with his present status, teach the ignorant and vicious of his race that he must respect the seclusion of the white man’s home and the virtue of the white man’s wife and child, rather than to instill into his feeble brain the hope that he can ever tread in the same sphere.  If the negroes of the north and east will let the southern negro alone, with the aid of the white man, he will work out his own salvation; and this claim is amply borne out by the progress the negro has been helped to make in the south in the last fifty years. Interference on the part of northern and eastern people simply retards the progress the negro might make, because it poisons the negro’s mind, and puts vain and foolish ambitions into his kinky head.",
