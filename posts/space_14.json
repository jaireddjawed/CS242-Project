        "text": "I'm no Stephen Hawking, nor do I have any degree or any education related to physics, but I have a theory with black holes when it comes to light.  \nMy basic understanding of a singularity is a point where escape velocity of that black hole exceeds the speed of light. An object flying by a celestial body is supposed to get faster the closer it is to that celestial body, but because c is the speed limit of the universe, a black hole's gravity can't accelerate an object that has crossed the event horizon, thus, it is forced into an orbit around the black hole. Again, I am not sure if this is right, and I am completely fine with being told otherwise, because I am asking this to learn.  \nThat also begs the question: Would you be able to see light orbiting inside the event horizon when you cross it? Or would crossing the event horizon look more like how Kurzgesagt described it?",

(Obviously it's just hypothetical you wouldn't be able to see anything at all as you would be dead before your mind can even process anything.)\n\nSo in contrast to that, would the black hole look almost still if you observed it from far away?

The gravity would be higher, and if something went wrong, a mission could be dispatched fairly quickly. What do you think?",
