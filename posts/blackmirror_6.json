I really enjoyed how minimal and simple the ringtones and text tones the characters had in the show were and was hoping to get my hands on them. I already found the ones from Nosedive and Hated in the Nation, but I'm hoping someone has access to the other ones (especially any text tones). Let me know.",

        "text": "Just recently binge watched every season. It seems like the earlier episodes focus more on current technologies (particular social media) undermining social cohesion. E.g., the pig fucking episode shows how social media and the twenty-four hour news cycle can manipulate the state and the trolls in Shut Up and Dance undermine our trust in each other by exposing monsters among us.\n\nThis culminates with The Waldo Moment, when a uniquely appealing political entertainment product is wielded by media executives who neither care about nor understand the real world implications of what they're doing. They exploit the existing tears in the social fabric and ultimately enable the rise of global totalitarianism.\n\nI think the remaining episodes explore the fall out of that societal break down coupled with continued exponential technological sophistication.  Maybe the timeline splinters so different futures may be more or less dystopian.\n\nI haven't looked closely at all the episodes in order, so I'm not quite sure if this idea completely holds up, but I think it's interesting.\n\nEDIT: Yeah, the sequence that the episodes are released in doesn't seem to matter at all. Shut Up and Dance is season 3 and The Waldo Moment is 2. Still, the in-universe chronology works.",

I actually really enjoyed this, and always liked seeing a lot of talented actors/actresses that I had never seen before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut in season 4, I feel like I'm seeing a huge spike in actors/actresses that I recognize from other movies and shows. At first, I thought they were just doppelgangars to more popular actors, but after looking up on IMDB, I realized that they actually *were* the actors I was thinking of. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHas anyone else had this revelation? Or did I maybe just not recognize the early season actors out of chance or because of disconnect from their markets?",

Anyways I decided to  re-watch 15MM and I never realized that when abi and bing talk after he gets her stuck apple, he says your a new person Ive not seen you, she replies Well I just turned 21 last week, and she wanted to go to \"air down\" as her sister's there but it's full. To me this completely changed how I thought of 15MM. To me it seems like going to that facility is a choice you make when you turn 21 but that makes me ask Where were they before, what were they doing before, were they just at different part of the facility, why would you want to go there, why don't you talk about your time pre 21. Also she says she wanted to go to \"air down\" as opposed to biking so that means that there are many other jobs at the facility we don't know about, I am not sure if air down is full because it requires getting passed hot shot and is like full like they were with the singers or not but it could also be another menial labour job. If it is a menial labour job, how many other of these jobs are there? I kind of thought it was like Hang the DJ where they couldn't remember how they got there because its a simulation or some sort of cookie jail, but now I don't know what to think, What do you guys think?. I did try and see if any else talked about this but I couldn't find anything. Sorry if has all been said before! \n\n\n",

I mean we don‚Äôt know if there was any technology available to be able to know the father without DNA test after birth so maybe Beth was holding the block until she found out who was the father and had joe been the father she would have unblocked him and made up a story about her reaction without ever revealing the affair. I know even in our world there are ways to find out paternity of foetus but this involves a risky procedure that many people would rather avoid. \n\nI read a few posts about that episode and i never saw any mention about the fact that her behavior which seem irrational could have had a different explanation (why not just telling him? Abortion or taking the risk that joe never finds out about affair if the child turns out to be his?) \n",

        "text": "Of course, not as bad a Black Museum, but it's when I realized the show was going downhill. S3 is not as good as The last two seasons, and S4 is unrecognizable as Black Mirror. But Playtest has endured to me as the mark. The sudden shift in tone and the direction was obvious, and it didn't feel inspired as the other episodes were. It didn't seem to try to make any points about anything, it just felt like spectacle for the sake of spectacle. It was the first episode I watched that felt Hollow and didn't have any meaning to it besides trying to shock whoever's watching. I expected more people to feel the same way but I guess I'm the only one. The biggest problem is the ending, that just destroys everything that episode tried to build. \n\nBlack Mirror for me was always about how a good technology could go wrong, how our obsession with information and self image could destroy us. But this episode didn't seem to care about any of that. In the end, it's a guy that dies, the end. \n\nTo be honest, I'm not sure why I dislike it so much, I just know it doesn't feel like I the same thing anymore. It didn't have what hooked me into the series in the first place.",

Stripe starts crying and gives a heartfelt speech explaining what he has found out about the genocide and all. Then it is revealed that it appears to Hunter as if Stripe has been infected and is turning into a roach, his skin changes colour and his voices starts to sound like the roaches voices to her. She shoots Stripe midway through a sentence. Later,  Stripe's death is mourned greatly and he is remembered as a faithful soldier who loved his cause and fought bravely. It is used as propaganda to make people fight harder to exterminate the \"roaches\". In fact, nobody thought that the roaches would actually he able to inflict casualties on the army, so his death becomes an international news story, and he becomes the figurehead of the latest recruitment campaign, which uses his image and the slogan: HE would have wanted it!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(idk i randomly thought of this idea this morning after i awoke from my nightmare)",
