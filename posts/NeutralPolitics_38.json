For perspective, the banking and real estate industries have profit margins that average over 20%, and major drug manufacturers average profit margins of nearly 22%.\n\n&gt;The ACA implemented MLR guidelines that require health insurance companies to spend the bulk of what they collect in premiums on medical claims. That automatically limits their administrative expenses - including executive compensation and profits - to no more than 20% of premium revenue.\n\n&gt;But there's no similar requirement for hospitals, device manufacturers, or drug manufacturers.\n\nSeeing as (anecdotal statement) hopsitals can charge $100 for a single Tylenol is somewhat ridicules.\n\nSo what can be done via market solutions (or command) to reduce the costs to consumers placed on them by providers.\n\nThings to think about that are costly: labor, legal, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment.\n\nEdit: mods could you let some comments without sources stay, economics is one of those conversation topics that simply require a specific type of philosophical mindset and less source porn.",

        "text": "A [study](https://evans.uw.edu/sites/default/files/NBER%20Working%20Paper.pdf) released 6/26/17 from the University of Washington revealed the following about the results of the Seattle minimum wage increase:\n\n&gt; Using a variety of methods to analyze employment in\nall sectors paying below a specified real hourly rate, we conclude that the second wage increase\nto $13 reduced hours worked in low-wage jobs by around 9 percent, while hourly wages in such\njobs increased by around 3 percent. Consequently, total payroll fell for such jobs, implying that the minimum wage ordinance lowered low-wage employees’ earnings by an average of $125 per month in 2016\n\nA $1500 annual reduction (or 6.6%) in pay for someone making ~~minimum wage~~ less than $19/hour seems like a big hit. Did this policy end up hurting a demographic of society that it was intended to help?\n\nHere are additional commentaries on the study.\n\n[538](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/seattles-minimum-wage-hike-may-have-gone-too-far/) commented on the advantage of the level of detail the data they used had:\n\n&gt;The Washington study has one big advantage over most past research: The authors had access to detailed data on the hours and earnings of nearly all employees in Washington state, allowing them to measure the effects of the minimum wage much more directly than is possible with less complete datasets.\n\n[Seattle Times](http://www.seattletimes.com/business/uw-study-finds-seattles-minimum-wage-is-costing-jobs/) mentioned a quote from one of the researchers who conducted the study:\n\n&gt;“If you’re a low-skilled worker with one of those jobs, $125 a month is a sizable amount of money,” said Mark Long, a UW public-policy professor and one of the authors of the report. “It can be the difference between being able to pay your rent and not being able to pay your rent.”\n\n&gt;The report also estimated that there are about 5,000 fewer low-wage jobs in the city than there would have been without the law.",

Most of those savings would come from a drop in spending on Medicaid, which the CBO expects will fall 26 percent by 2026, relative to current law. That deficit reduction is higher than the estimated $119 billion saved by the House plan.”\n\nTo put this in perspective what other ways will similar amounts of tax dollars be spent during that time period?",

It has been informative, but likely a lot less \"Neutral\" than the sub dictates.\n\nLessons learned:  \n\nClarify Volksverhetzung.  \"Hate speech\" is grossly simplified as translation, as that term carries connotations far outside what the German law rather clearly specifies as Volksverhetzung.\n\nProvide more sources than the recent sweep.  German Law enforcement is not acting on fresh regulation.  Restriction, fines and arrest on internet postings have context going back decades for those found in violation and the public is not yet in Orwellian dytopia.  Having a bit of history might have avoided so much \"slippery slope\" discussion.\n\nNarrow the scope.  This has been an amazing free speech discussion, but I think I was a bit shortsighted in how easily this could be derailed from my initial request.",

Since I've heard many claims that most of them are these so-called opportunists [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/migrants-are-disguising-themselves-as-syrians-to-gain-entry-to-europe/2015/09/22/827c6026-5bd8-11e5-8475-781cc9851652_story.html), [here](http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/09/economist-explains-4) and [here](http://www.ibtimes.com.au/syrian-refugee-crisis-being-used-opportunists-cory-bernardi-1465187) but I'm not sure if there is any merit to that claim.\n\nThank you for reading my questions.",

The goal of this is to reduce the time between repeat purchases of a product from the same manufacturer. One example of such a product would be smartphones, with emphasis on iPhones. \n\nWith the recent Supreme Court case, [Impression v. Landmark](http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/impression-products-inc-v-lexmark-international-inc/), could be seen as a step towards mitigating planned obsolescence. A Right to Repair could be seen as a [precedent for similar cases](https://www.wired.com/2017/06/impression-v-lexmark/), such as the one involving farmers repairing or modifying their tractors.\n\n\n[France has recently passed a law aimed to mitigate planned obsolescence strategies by manufacturers.](https://www.fastcompany.com/3043252/this-new-french-law-is-designed-to-make-products-easier-to-repair-so-th) This law requires manufacturers to label their products with how long spare parts for that product will be available, and they must repair or replace the product if it breaks within the first two years of purchase.\n\n\nWhat other strategies have been proposed to reduce planned obsolescence?",

        "text": "...*If* you wanted to eliminate the deficit.  There's obviously lots of debate on whether you only need to keep a healthy ratio of spending to GDP.\n\nBut *if* eliminating the deficit is your goal, would some legislation similar to the GOP Healthcare bill be necessary?  The US spends $1.2 Trillion on Medicaid + Medicare.  From [cms.gov](https://www.cms.gov/research-statistics-data-and-systems/statistics-trends-and-reports/nationalhealthexpenddata/nhe-fact-sheet.html)\n\n&gt;* Medicare spending grew 4.5% to $646.2 billion in 2015\n\n&gt;* Medicaid spending grew 9.7% to $545.1 billion in 2015\n\nThe new GOP Healthcare Bill makes changes to Medicaid spending.  [CNN:](http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/22/politics/senate-health-care-bill/index.html)\n\n&gt;* The bill would continue the enhanced Medicaid expansion funding from Obamacare until 2021 and then phase it out over three years. This is a concession to moderates, who weren't pleased that the House version would end the enhanced support for new enrollees in 2020.\n\n&gt;* The Senate bill would keep the House plan to send a fixed amount of money to states each year based on enrollment or as a lump sum block grant. But it would shrink the program even more over time by pegging the annual growth rate of those funds to standard inflation, rather than the more generous medical inflation, starting in 2025. This would likely force states to cut enrollment, benefits or provider payments.\n\n&gt;* The Senate bill would also largely maintain Obamacare's premium subsidies structure, but tighten the eligibility criteria starting in 2020. Fewer middle class folks would get help because only those earning up to 350% of the poverty level would qualify, rather than the 400% threshold contained in Obamacare. But it would also open up the subsidies to enrollees below the poverty level so those living in states that didn't expand Medicaid could get some assistance.\n\n***\n\nSo is this a good step *if* you want to cut the eliminate the deficit?  [Here's a graph](http://www.thinkadvisor.com/2013/04/03/health-entitlement-spending-a-story-in-6-charts?page=3) showing a CBO projection of Medicaid/Medicare spending.  The total of the two items in six years will be about 3 times our defense spending, which is our second largest budget item.  The current annual federal deficit is about equal to our annual defense spending.  The remaining big ticket items are interest payments, pensions, and welfare which are each about half the deficit/defense amount. [This](https://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/4/15/1292380/-Federal-Spending-In-One-Beautiful-Pie-Chart) seems like a good pie chart summarizing federal spending.\n\nSo is there a spending/revenue plan that could eliminate the deficit without Medicare or Medicaid?  If so, what would that plan look like?  If not, is the GOP bill effective?\n",
