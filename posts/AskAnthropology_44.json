        "text": "I was thinking about this the other day, languages are incredibly different. Like how English is a great language for puns (is this the reason English has Twain, Shakespeare and Carrol?), while Spanish seems to me more flourish and prone to more being more sonorous (could this explain old romance novels? And what about magical realism?). And though I can't speak any Russian, I can tell that Russian literature also seems pretty distinct.\n\nOr what about Bahasa Malaysia for example? They have no gender and no infliction for tense or number, but they do have a lot of voices. Is this reflected on their literature?\n\nSo my question is, to what extent do languages themselves influence literature? Is there anything I could read on the subject or am I just seeing things with confirmation bias glasses?",

        "text": "There seems to be some dissatisfaction with this sub lately, and this thread is an attempt build constructive dialogue around these general feelings of discontent.\n\nTo start things off, I think it's prudent to ask the question: **what is the overall goal of this sub?** In other words, what are the people who makeup this sub trying to accomplish?\n\nFor me (and others may disagree), the purpose is to bridge the gap between academia and the public realm. Anthropology (and academia in general) is problematic in the sense that the knowledge it produces is not communicated effectively to the public at large. Heavy theory and jargon (among other barriers) dissuade many casual observers from understanding and attempting to understand all the great knowledge that is produced in this and related fields.\n\nAnd while this sub is currently hit-or-miss with regards to questions asked and answers given, I have seen inspiring dialogue result – and I think this is what we should be after. There are many intelligent students of anthropology who participate in this forum, and many of their answers are nothing short of amazing.\n\nThis brings us to the **sticky idea** that was recently proposed. If public-academic dialogue is a main goal of this sub, I think we need to be careful with this idea, as it could potentially shutdown debate. Not everyone has the tools or 'expert' jargon at their disposal when formulating questions, and this shouldn't dissuade them from asking questions that are important to them. I'm afraid that a permanent sticky that pre-emptively attempts to 'correct' errors in thought/language before they are even made may be perceived as elitist and turn some users away.\n\nIt is for this reason that I agree with [brigantus](https://www.reddit.com/user/brigantus) who brought up the idea of a [stickied thread reminding people to be patient and assume good faith when answering questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnthropology/comments/54jsug/meta_do_we_have_active_mods_anymore_ive_been/d83fvdv).\n\nThat doesn't mean that people couldn't create some type of resource that educates others about the use of out-dated terms (such as primitive, advanced etc), I just  think this resource shouldn't necessarily be tied to (or in any way limit) the questions that people are trying to formulate.\n\nThis sub has tremendous potential, and through a process of consensus-building I think that we can really turn this into a remarkable resource for anthropologists and non-anthropologists alike.\n",

You're meant to be able to figure out the word based on what you know. Similarly, I've heard many people say that western education is focused on problem solving and ingenuity. \n\nIn the east, many languages are character based and tend towards memorization of how the word sounds; you either know it or you don't. The education style as I know it leans more on memorization of facts than problem solving. \n\nHas there been any research on the subject? Does this idea have any potential merit, or is it just coincidence?

They reported that they commonly would not eat for four days. They also reported that the males of the tribe would stay up throughout the night in order to protect the women. Lastly, they reported that they were quite afraid of predators (e.g. snakes, big cats, etc.).\n\nIn the end, this tribe was happy to leave the jungle, live with clothing, and essentially abandon much of their old way of living.\n\nMy question is, do most tribes report feeling this way? That life is extremely hard for them as hunter-gatherers, that it's commonplace to go most of the week without food, and so on?

It's also satisfying to know that humans can hold their own on the earth with nothing but the skin on their backs.",

You can't really just get up and walk out of the water, go into a forest and start hunting, and cutting down trees. You're restricted to the ocean, and sometimes rivers that feed into the ocean.\n\nThe major aspects that need answering/research are\n\n1. Food. What food would you have realistic access too if you're a relatively slow swimmer, but capable of tool use at a modern human skill level. Shellfish, crustaceans and Fish are obvious, but what non animal food sources could a hominin also eat?  \n\n2. Tools: Without reliable or widely distributed access to wood and metals, what kind of tool building materials can you rely upon? Shells, stone and bones are obvious answers, but rope/string, and other tools are also important.\n\n3. Fire/cooking: Fuel for fires so you can cook foods on the beach. What kind of sources for cooking fire fuel can be relied upon?\n\n4. Fresh Water: This aspect seems fairly difficult without some serious adaptation to your kidneys, fresh water is paramount to survival, so what prehistoric behaviors could result in effectively acquiring some fresh water for drinking.(Not needed for bathing)\n\nI've been looking at the  Bajau people as some sort of reference, but they're obviously more modern than the limitations that I'm working with.\n\nSorry if this seems a bit cryptic, ask questions if you'd like to help and I can explain as much as I can without breaking copyright/NDA.",

        "text": "Hi everyone, I'm a current undergrad studying Anthropology but since graduation is coming up in May, I've recently been having second thoughts about my focus and I'm wondering if anyone has any advice.\n\n\nFor some background, I'm a senior at an Ivy in the US. I'm majoring in Anthropology with a concentration in archaeology and a biology minor. I chose the archaeology concentration because it's the only one available in the department, and I do really love it. However, my studies have been primarily focused on bioarchaeology and human evolution. This summer I went to an amazing field school and got incredible bioarchaeology/human osteology experience that's allowing me to write a really cool senior thesis that I'll hopefully be presenting at the AAPA. I was also a TA for a zooarchaeology class last semester. So, I have experience in my field, as well as some archaeological survey experience. \n\nSince before applying to college, I knew I wanted to pursue a PhD in Anthropology (Physical) immediately following graduation. I've been sticking with this plan up until a few weeks ago when the semester started. I've always had a broad range of interests within the sciences and social sciences, and recently I've been realizing that a PhD may not be for me. I feel like the work I've been doing and would continue to do on this path is pretty limited to within academia. I don't mean in terms of employment (although that is true and important), but rather that the work I'd be doing isn't really having an impact on anyone except for academics. I kind of feel like it doesn't *matter* because it's so restricted, so it's only available to certain people. And that sucks to realize because this entire time I've been defending what I study when people ask why it's useful, and I still love and defend it, but I'm starting to see their point. \n\nI think that what I actually want to do is something that will have a tangible impact on people. I've been seriously considering public health, public policy, health policy, or something involving advocacy or related fields because I'm very passionate about research and people and would love to combine the two. Unfortunately, I don't have experience in any of these areas because I've been so committed to biological anthropology. I've taken coursework in evolutionary biology but haven't taken any chemistry, calculus or physics that are recommended for careers in public health. I'm taking intro to statistics and also data analysis with Python this semester, and plan on taking more stats and computer science next semester since I've finished all of my other requirements. The public health courses at the university are only available to the MPH students so I cannot enroll in any of those. So, I've been thinking about applied anthropology because of my anthro experience but I don't see many programs for it in the US.\n\nI've recently become very interested in health policy, but this lack of experience thing is really bringing me down. I'd hate to commit to eight years of graduate school for something that I love so much but don't want to do forever. But I also don't want to act on a potential impulse resulting from a senior year crisis. I'm sorry for the long post, I guess I'm just looking for any advice at all. Thanks for reading!\n\nTL;DR: undergrad senior passionate about physical anthropology, have done lots of work towards it. Possibly considering a career change that has more of a community impact like public health, health policy, or applied anthropology, but don't know where to start/feeling lost.",

During this period of time, remarkably little evidence is shown that the Jomon people ever innovated much beyond clay pottery. The earliest indications of a more advanced technology comes from various burial mounds in which likely early Chinese imported iron swords were found. Then, as time progressed Japan seemed to \"skip a stage\" in technological innovation (e.x. never really developed the use of bronze tools or art, with some exceptions). In most anthropological evidence that I have seen, cultures follow a pretty similar \"tech tree\" to use a gaming term. Was this jump in technology the result of heavy importing from their mainland neighbors, due to a lack of resources, or just due to a lack of pressure to innovate? Thanks!",

Expansion, especially to such a degree, is usually explained by some geological, ecological, or sociological context. But, considering the relatively low population in North and South America at the time, and the overwhelming prevalence of flora and fauna, even mega-fauna, for hunting, the likelihood that societies could be driven farther south due to resource scarcity seems slim at best. Therefore, what drove such a far expansion to the south? Did the prevalence of resources provide an excess in which exploration could be considered a worthwhile use of the cultures time and effort, or was necessity the driving factor?\n\n;tldr; I can't think of any reasons for such a dramatic expansion south that there seems to have been?

Now, to an extent, that is good, though I think often the best ideas come out of conflict, and criticism can lead to the development of nuance or even to discarding bad ideas.\n\nBut my biggest concern is that this was written in 1984, over thirty years ago. So my seeing similarities between what she says and what I'm aware of may be less because the situation is similar and more because I'm less than aware of the major discussions going on in present-day anthropology.\n\nIf it's the latter, this is something I want to rectify since I'll be starting on my thesis soon.\n\nThe only thing I'm aware of, really, is controversy over to what degree anthropologists should be involved in political advocacy or other such things. For example, I'm told there was serious conflict over whether the AAA should take a stance on the Israel/Palestine situation.\n\nAnyway, in general, what are the biggest controversial topics and disagreements in the field of anthropology (particularly cultural anthropology) today, in 2016?",

Before I dash off to the professor (I'm worried about sounding like an idiot), does anyone have any information on what this type of diagram is?\n\nThank you all for your time.",

        "text": "Hi all,\n\nDo anthropologists ever advocate for the people they meet and the things they see and encounter in their fieldwork experience? Do they ever try and push for policy or Law implementation(s)? I was curious because I can imagine they would see a great deal of corrupt and unethical/illegal activity when engaged in some of their research. Depending on the topic this can vary, but something like refugees, indigenous/Natives etc (you get the idea). Im curious to know if this happens and/or if this is this frowned upon? Are anthropologists supposed to take a bipartisan stance? Also, wouldn't this defeat the purpose by having a vested interest? If anyone could offer me any information regarding this and any anthropologists who have done similar work that would be great. \n\nThanks! ",

They probably recognize one another, but just go by \"you\" for the most part.\n\nWell, humans are also animals. So is it possible that at some point--and maybe even now--there are some primitive human cultures who simply do not assign names to people?\n\nActually, calling them \"primitive\" is really quite ethnocentric. Even the idea of having a first name and a last name is ethnocentric; some cultures don't do this. Well, I'm taking it a step further and asking about people with no names at all.",
