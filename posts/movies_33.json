I'm a big fan of IMAX for films that take advantage of the taller aspect ratio, but my understanding is that *JW4* does not. Is that right?\n\nSo we are definitely leaning Dolby this time around, assuming *JW4* was not shot with IMAX cameras. However, does anyone know if it will be shown in the standard 2.40:1 aspect ratio in an IMAX theatre, or will it still have a taller format? We also prefer the reclining seats in Dolby theaters vs the smaller ones featured in IMAX theaters.",

        "text": "Before I get started... Yes, I am touching on a potentially sensitive subject, but the mindset here isn't to present myself as unruly or racist, nor do I think anyone commenting would approach the subject from that point of view. I'm just looking to observe what others on Reddit think about some of the ethnically diverse casting choices that have been surfacing lately.  \n\n\nI'm going to reference Disney here because they are (for better or for worse) a prime example of what I'm talking about... Reimaging a classic character such as Ariel, Peter Pan, Tinkerbell, or Belle by swapping their ethnicity... HBO is doing the same thing with pivotal characters in The Last of Us, or Warner Bros playing into the realm of LGBTQ+ in Hogwarts Legacy because of some well-known statements made by She Who Shall Not Be Named...\n\n  \nExcellent. Hollywood is broadening the perspectives of well-known characters by playing the what-if-they-were-black card. Is it because the Actor had the best take on the role? Is it a choice that effectively serves the story? Are we putting a character with a disability into a film or series to serve the story, or mainly just to show the production is politically diverse?  \n\n\nI'm all for ethnic diversity in casting. I think iconic characters need to be developed that don't just cater to your classic 90s-style white, blonde male model, but more importantly, I think those choices need to come from the heart, not from politics. If you put some of Hollywood's most brilliant minds in the writer's room, I am certain the team would build an instant classic. And would those same ideas be appreciated if we swapped this perspective?  \n\n\nIf Arnold Vosloo was cast as T'Challa, or Charlize Theron as Princess Tiana, or Matt Damon as Finn (Star Wars), or if A24 took the film Moonlight and redeveloped it with an entirely white cast... Would it be equally accepted? Opening up casting diversity is a choice that needs to be recognized both ways, but I'm curious about what others think of the subject.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/11l8c2o/is_the_message_of_toy_story_2_flawed/",
        "text": "In Toy Story 2, the antagonist, The Prospector, argues that toys should not engage with children. He insists that these relationships are superfluous because they are doomed to fail. The rest of the Roundup Gang comes to the conclusion that they should engage with these relationships, because it's better than sitting behind glass at a museum.\n\nBut my question is, is the Prospector really wrong? Of course, he was wrong to force his beliefs onto the toys. And it makes sense. Sitting behind glass at a museum sounds like a miserable existence. And I get the metaphor. It's preferable to take risks and open your heart even if you're scared of being heart.. versus rotting in seclusion.\n\nBut my question is, is this message flawed at all? While yes, it's certainly better to open your heart and engage with people, despite the risk of being hurt - would you really want to enter a relationship that is absolutely certain to end? The relationship toys have with their owners is not just \"oh, this might end one day, but I'll take the risk.\" The children \\*will\\* outgrow the toys and leave them. It's a certainty and they know it. Can you imagine entering a romantic relationship with someone who tells you upfront they're going to leave you one day? It just sounds like a horrible cycle for the characters.\n\nA possible rebuttal is that the toys don't always revolve their lives solely around the owners and have each other. Showcased especially by Woody telling Buzz he can handle Andy growing up because he'll still have Buzz afterwards. Perhaps it's okay and healthy if the person knows and accepts the relationship is finite. You can argue relationships don't always have to mandate permeance.\n\nSo, what do you all think? I'm not necessarily stating if it's flawed or not, but I'd like to see a discussion about this.",

Especially considering I love pretty much anything Ridley Scott touches. \n\nFantastic movie. \n\nThere was one thing that just didn’t make sense to me though. Deckard is a hardened Blade Runner who’s seen it all and seems to “retire” replicants with little or no thought certainly nothing that would weigh on his conscience. Then all of a sudden he meets a cute robot and he switches to “we gotta get you to Canada!” Did I miss something? I really thought I was paying attention haha. Like was his revelation just that Rachael thought she was human? That was enough for him to throw it all away? Oh, this one *thinks* she’s human so that changes everything (?). Was it because she saved him when she retired Leon? It just felt like the relationship went from point A to point C. Were there any details or scenes that maybe I didn’t notice that make the change of heart? The scenes of Rachael and Deckard in his apartment come off as kind of aggressive and awkward. I just don’t think I took the relationship as seriously as the film wanted me to. Am I way off here? It’s my first time seeing it so hoping some actual fans can enlighten me 👍",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/11l6jmj/why_does_nina_not_have_regular_nail_clippers_in/",
        "text": "So I watched Black Swan for the first time last night. I really loved the movie, and I think that it represented what being in the performing arts can be like well since there is so much pressure to be the best or be “perfect” while also trying to outdo tons of other people who are reaching for that same goal.\n\n\nIn the movie, it is shown that Nina has a nervous habit of scratching her upper right back. Her mother helps her with this by giving her boleros to wear to cover it up, but also by cutting Nina’s nails super short to prevent the itching and marks on her back. \n\n\nThe scenes where Nina is shown getting her nails cut or cutting her own nails, a pair of (what seems like) beauty/brow scissors are used instead of regular nail clippers. There are also scenes where Nina is shown filing her nails with the nail file that she took from Beth’s dress room. Nina’s itching issue/nails are a symbolism of her need to be perfect, which is why it arises many times throughout the movie. \n\n\nMy question is, is there any particular reason why they chose to use scissors instead of regular nail clippers? The movie is set in 2000’s/2010’s New York City, so obviously they had them. Are the scissors meant to make the nail trimmings seem more unnecessary and brutal, since Nina *could* use regular nail clippers but still opts for the scissors that her mother uses to cut her nails? Or because it’s easier for her to hurt herself with them?\n\n\nI don’t know why this detail in the movie bothered me so much. Every time there was a scene with her getting her nails cut, I was just like *does the gigantic ballet company you dance for not have normal nail clippers just laying around in dressings rooms there or something? Using scissors is going to make them more uneven and scratchy.*",

        "text": "Trying to branch out in my movie knowledge and have been exploring a wide variety of films from the 1990s, which was the decade of my birth and comprised my early childhood. I suppose it's a way of living vicariously/an act of sheer nostalgia, but I also believe that movies then were made differently than they are now: casting, color grading, pacing, special effects, scores, you name it. Even the types of movies that get made have drastically changed: almost never do you see what I call \"middle-class movies,\" e.g., romantic dramas and inoffensive studio productions that people my parents' age would have seen on a date night back in the day. I often miss this era of filmmaking and hugely prefer it to our modern CGI spectacles that all too often end up looking the same and feel more like rollercoaster rides than they do motion pictures.\n\nI've been exploring a wide swath of movies made during this time (blockbusters, comedies, thrillers, indie films, foreign films, sci-fi, the aforementioned middle-class movies), but am seeking more to add to my list and eventually check out in time. So, what might you recommend? Lesser-known titles are preferable, but feel free to champion big-name movies as well.",

        "text": "Wow! It definitely earns the classic status that it holds. The sweeping cinematography, the excellent performances (from Peter O'Toole and Omar Sharif especially), the tremendous and instantly recognizable score. \n\nMy high school history teacher, who taught us a lot about the Arab-Israeli conflict, said that this was his favorite movie. I can see why, as while it's not 100% historically accurate, it's steeped in real history and makes you want to learn more. \n\nOne thing I will note is the use of brownface. I understand that it's a product of its time, I'm well aware of hollywood history in that respect, but it's still distracting to me. Like, Alec Guinness didn't do anything egregiously offensive, but I couldn't get around the idea that this is just another British guy with brown makeup on. \n\nThat said, it's an excellent film. Definitely an epic of proportions that just aren't made today. What do you think?",

Common themes include Biblical stories, mythology, and legend.*\" I don't know if this will help a lot, but I hope it does.\n\nIf you can think of any movie that fits this description I'd really appreciate it :)",

It is to me is what makes movies entertaining in the business. However, trends tend to come along and oversaturate the market for better or most of time worse. It can be your typical horror movie with a predictable plot and terrible character actions or a drama filled thriller with an interesting plot but tends to fizzle out during the second part of the movie. But it comes a time where trend can be so positive that it can bring out the better part of the movie business.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIts has probably been talked about before but Into the spider-verse really changed the way animation can be creative and but also drive a hard hitting story as well. After viewing the new Teen age mutant ninja turtles trailer, I can see the huge impact that movie has had and how other studios aren't Moreso copying the animation page for page but aren't definitely taking their inspirations. Also movies like Mitchel's vs the machine , Puss in boots last wish, Bad guys  are the driving impact of Into the spiderverse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat movies trends do you see having a positive impact in the industry?",
