The famous twin paradox states, that if one of the twins stays on earth and the other goes on a spaceship journey to another star and returns, the twin on earth will be much older than the one on the journey. Now in this experiment you could consider the twin that went on the journey to have time traveled into earths future.\n\nPractically however to timetravel any significant amount into the future the traveler would have to be able to accelerate to a speed near the magnitute of speed of light, otherwise the effect is negligible. This means at the moment we could dedicate our lives timetraveling into the future by going on a 50 year long space journey, only to come back to an earth that aged 50 years and a few extra seconds.",

([physics.stackexchange](https://physics.stackexchange.com) and [physicsforums.com](https://www.physicsforums.com) specifically)\n\nIt also seems like the physics forums want to jump to the conclusion that I am \"putting forward my own theories\" or something when I am just asking WHY something doesn't work like how I would guess it does. I mean I know that physicists are sick of hearing every idiot's ideas on how things should work, but can't we just have a discussion about the universe without some sort of \"gotcha\" every three seconds! (\"Oooo! You don't understand how that works - let me just call you an idiot and close the thread!\" Or, \"What? That's not how it works. How dare you propose a new theory in this hallowed sacred forum?!?\")\n\nI don't want to propagate some sort of  un-scientific theory or anything, I just have some questions I would like to discuss and would like someone to explain to me. \n\nDoes anyone know a place like that?",

Car A has low speed, high torque (due to lower gear). Car B has high speed, low torque. Why does Car A need more torque to run at a constant lower speed and why do you need less torque at higher speeds?\n2. Suppose, we provide more gas/power to Car A and crank it to 3500 rpm. The engine provides more force to the gear and the gear/car accelerates. After some time, Car A reaches 40mph at 3500rpm and maintains a constant speed. On the other hand, Car B is running at 40mph as well but at 2200 rpm. So, both cars are now running at same constant speed but Car A is at higher power/higher torque and car B is at low power/low torque. The torque \"T\" provided by Car B was enough to overcome the resistive forces at 40mph and keep the car running at a constant speed. Since, Car A has more torque than T now at same speed, what is that \"extra\" torque being utilized for? Car A is not accelerating as well.\n3. The above situation is similar to downshifting we do while overtaking. See [this](https://youtu.be/sR-4dpuZcIk?t=261) for example. We're running at 3rd gear 40mph but we crank our engine keeping the speed same (holding the clutch), lower the gear to 2nd, and release the clutch. Now, at 2nd gear and same speed, we have more power and higher torque. BUT the car doesn't accelerate until we press the gas pedal again. Why? The torque we had at 3rd gear was enough to keep the car at constant speed but as soon as we increase the torque by lowering the gear, shouldn't the car accelerate without needing to press the accelerator again?",

But, just like riding a big wave, understanding quantum physics can be a real rush.\n\nSo, let's talk about hot chicks. In the quantum world, hot chicks, or electrons, behave in a way that's totally different from how we expect them to behave in the macro world, you know, like how a hot chick is different from a regular chick.\n\nFor example, in the quantum world, hot chicks can exist in multiple states or locations at the same time, like how a hot chick can be in multiple parties at the same time. This is known as superposition. And, when you try to measure or observe a hot chick's state or location, it collapses into one definite state, like how a hot chick can only be in one place at a time. This is called wave function collapse.\n\nAnother gnarly concept in quantum physics is entanglement, brah. It's like when two hot chicks are so connected that what happens to one hot chick affects the other one, even if they are far away from each other.\n\nFinally, quantum physics also talks about the uncertainty principle, which states that it's impossible to know certain properties of hot chicks, like their location and momentum, at the same time with complete accuracy, like how a surfer can't predict the exact moment a wave will break.\n\nSo, in summary, quantum physics is all about understanding the gnarly behavior of hot chicks in the universe, and it's a wild ride.",

I'm not a physicist, but I've had an interest since I was a teenager and read Michio Kaku's Hyperspace.\n\nAnyway, I've read up on pilot wave theory as well, and found it fairly compelling, and way more easy to reason about than pure statistical models, and had a lot of hope for future developments. But, my understanding is that the recent discoveries by, Aspect, Clauser and Zeilinger seem to throw a wrench in the whole thing.\n\nIs there any hope for PWT? Any researchers working on updating PWT to account for these recent experiments? I know I'll probably get a lot of responses just telling me to give up on PWT, but I'm really interested to hear if there's been any response from the PWT advocates in the physics community.\n\nThanks",
