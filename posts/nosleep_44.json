We rang previous at one am too do our order but there was no answer which was weird but we went anyways since it’s open and the website even said it was open and it usually always is.                                                             \n\n\n\nWhen we got there it was closed and dark with only a dim eerie white and blue light and we were like FECK SAKE no FOCKIN chips dia ma shábhail.Little did we know that was not the issue at all.                                                                        \n\n\nWe decided to walk back home since it was late and our walk wasn’t meant to last that long.On our way home we received a call from P and I answered knowing she would be curious of our whereabouts.                                                         \n\n\nWhen I answered there was no one talking and I said hello ? I hung up P called abainn but this time there was a croaked mysterious voice talking saying “ where are yous “ I thought it was P just putting on a voice since she always does this and tries scare us she once pretended to be possessed at 5am so this didn’t surprise us but it kept ringing after we hung up until we answered and said we’re almost home we will be arriving in ten minutes and the croaked voice answered by good… soon .                                     \n\n\nAs we walked up to the house all the lights were off.

        "text": "Hi, I'm John and I'm the smartest student in my class, but that doesn't mean I have it easy. I'm constantly bullied by my classmates because of my intelligence.\n\n I wanted to share with you the story that changed my life. It all started when I was walking down the street, listening to my music, when I noticed an old man. He was wearing a long, black coat and had a hood pulled up over his head. He was standing in the middle of the sidewalk, just staring off into the distance. I stopped and stared at him for a moment, wondering what he was doing there. Then he turned and looked right at me. \"What are you looking at kid?\" he asked in a gruff voice. I was taken aback by his sudden question. \"Um, nothing,\" I stammered. \"I was just walking to school.\" He nodded slowly and then said, \"Be careful out there. Have you heard the story about the forgotten diary of the devil?\"\n\n\"No, I haven't,\" I said. \"What's it about?\" The old man chuckled. \"It's said that long ago, the devil wrote down all of his secrets in a diary. But then he lost it, and no one has seen it since. Some say it's still out there, waiting to be found.\" I was intrigued. \"Do you think it's real?\" The old man shrugged. \"Who knows? But if you ever find it, make sure you don't open it. The devil's secrets are not meant for mortal eyes.\" He winked at me and then walked away, leaving me with my thoughts. I continued on my way to school, wondering if the forgotten diary of the devil really existed.\n\nI mean, how could something like that even exist? It seemed like something out of a horror movie. But then I started to think about it more and more. What if it was real? What if there was a diary out there that contained all the secrets of the devil? It seemed too crazy to be true, but I couldn't help but wonder.\n\nSuddenly I heard a loud crash. I looked up to see a truck had hit a man crossing the street. He was lying on the ground, motionless. I ran over to him, my heart pounding.\n\n\"Are you okay?\" I asked, kneeling down beside him. He didn't answer. I looked around for help, but no one else was around. I noticed something had fallen out of his pocket. It was a book.\n\nIt had a black cover with a red pentagram on it. I was both scared and intrigued. I had never seen anything like this before. I reached out and grabbed the book, and as soon as I did, I felt a chill run down my spine. I knew that this was no ordinary book. It was a diary, but not just any diary. It was the Devil's Diary.\n\nI quickly picked it up and put it in my bag, not wanting anyone else to see it.\n\nI stayed with the man until the ambulance arrived and took him away. As I watched them drive away, I wondered what was in the book and why he had been carrying it with him.\n\nI shuddered at the thought and quickened my pace. I knew that whatever secrets were hidden in this book were not meant for me to know. But still, I couldn't help but feel a strange sense of curiosity. I am running late for the class.\n\nI had to get to school before the bell rang or else I'd be in trouble. As I rushed through the school doors, I could feel my heart pounding in my chest. I was walking down the hallway, trying to get to my classroom as quickly as possible, when I felt a sudden jolt. I had bumped into someone with my backpack. \"Hey, watch where you're going!\" a voice shouted. I looked up to see the school bully, standing there with a scowl on his face. I gulped. \"I'm sorry,\" I said. \"It was an accident.\" The bully just glared at me. \"I want you to know that you better watch your back,\" Jake said. \"I'm gonna beat you up after school today.\"\n\nI gulped. I knew Jake was serious. He had a reputation for being a tough guy and I didn't want to get on his bad side. \"Look, Jake,\" I said, trying to stay calm. \"I don't want any trouble. Can't we just forget about this?\" Jake laughed and shook his head. \"No way,\" he said. \"You're gonna get what's coming to you.\" My heart was pounding in my chest as I watched Jake walk away. I knew I had to do something or else he would come after me after school. I had to find a way to stop him.\n\nI sit in my desk, my eyes darting around the room. I can feel the weight of the book in my bag. I know that it's forbidden, but I can't help but be curious.\n\nMy teacher is lecturing at the front of the room, but I'm not paying attention. All I can think about is the book. What secrets does it hold? What will happen if I get caught?\n\nI take a deep breath and make a decision. I slowly reach into my bag and pull out the diary. I open it to the first page and start to read.\n\n\"If you read this, you will be cursed with a fate worse than death. You will be denied entry to both Heaven and Hell. You will be forever trapped in a state of limbo, unable to move on to the afterlife.\"\n\nThe words were strange and unfamiliar. It was like nothing I had ever read before, and I couldn't help but feel a little scared. The words seemed to be written in a language that was not of this world, and yet somehow I could understand them.\n\nIt seems like it could be a real curse if I do.\n\nAfter some thought, I've decided to take the plunge and keep reading. Who knows what I'll find?\n\nAs I start reading, I felt my heart racing faster and faster. The words seemed to be describing something dark and sinister, something that made me feel uneasy. I felt like I was being pulled into a world of darkness and evil, and I wasn't sure if I wanted to go any further.\n\nBut then something strange happened. The words began to make sense. They seemed to be telling a story about John. He was a strong and courageous man who was always willing to take on any challenge.\n\nOne day, John was challenged to a fight by a much bigger and stronger opponent. Knowing that he could not win in a physical fight, John decided to use his wits instead. He quickly removed his shoes and filled them with his s\\*it.\n\nWhen the fight began, John's opponent was taken aback by the sight of John's shoes filled with s\\*it. Thinking that John was crazy, he charged forward with all his might. But when he tried to punch John, the hit from s\\*it shoes caused him to lose his balance.\n\nJohn took advantage of this opportunity and quickly pinned his opponent down. After a few minutes of struggling, the opponent finally gave up and conceded defeat.\n\nJohn had won the fight by using his wits and courage. He had proven that even the smallest of things can be used to great effect if used correctly. From then on, John was known as the brave man who fight by shi\\*ting inside his shoes.\n\nThat was both fascinating and terrifying at the same time.\n\nI couldn't help but be drawn in by the story, and before long I had finished it.\n\nI start to feel more confident, knowing that I have a plan now.\n\nI close the book and put it back in to my backpack, feeling ready to take on the bully.\n\nI was walking through the cafeteria,, feeling a little nervous about the fight with the Jake. I was so lost in my thoughts that I didn't even notice my best friend Tom walking towards me until he called out my name. \"Hey, what's up?\" Tom said, giving me a friendly smile. I smiled back, trying to hide my nervousness. \"Oh, not much. Just thinking about the fight I have to have later.\" Tom's eyes widened. \"You're fighting someone? Who?\" \"Jake,\" I said, feeling my stomach twist into knots. \"I got a plan and I'm going to try it out.\" Tom shook his head. \"That's crazy! I want to come and watch.\" I shook my head. \"No way. That's too dangerous.\" Tom shrugged. \"I know, but I want to help you out. I'll hide in the bushes and watch from there. That way, if anything happens, I can jump in and help you out.\" I hesitated for a moment, then nodded. \"Okay, that sounds like a plan.\" Tom grinned. \"Great! I'll see you there.\" He gave me a quick hug before running off. I watched him go, feeling a little better knowing that he would be there to help me out if anything went wrong.\n\nThe rest of the day went fast. After the school I nervously walked into the school parking lot, my heart pounding in my chest. I knew what I had to do, but I was scared. I had to face my bully.\n\nI can already feel the anger and fear bubbling up inside me. My palms are sweaty and my stomach is in knots as I get closer.\n\nI finally reach the spot where the Jack is waiting. I spotted him across the lot, leaning against his car, looking smug and confident. He looks me up and down with a sneer on his face. I try to stay calm. I remind myself that I'm not alone in this fight, and that I have people who care about me and are willing to help me if things get out of hand. The bully starts to say something, but before he can finish, i pull down my pant and start sh\\*ting inside my shoe.\n\nThe Jack face turns pale and he takes a few steps back. I stand there, my face expressionless, and I look him straight in the eye. I can see the shock and confusion in his eyes. I held the shoe in front of me like a shield and faced the bully.\n\n\"What are you going to do with that?\" Jack said. \"Hit me with it?\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" I said, trying to sound brave. \"But if you don't leave me alone, you'll find out.\"\n\nI felt my heart racing as I saw Jack charging towards me. He was bigger and stronger than me, and I knew I had to think fast. I threw one of the shoes in the Jack's face, temporarily blinding him. He stumbled back. I quickly tackle him on the ground and pinned him down. I shouted for help and soon Tom, holding a stick came to my rescue. We beat the bully and I take the opportunity to tell him that this is what happens when someone messes with us. Finally Jack pass out.\n\nI saw Tom standing there with a huge smile on his face. He was clapping and cheering me on. \"You did it!\" he shouted. \"You finally stood up to Jack!\"\n\nI couldn't believe it. Tom had been my biggest supporter throughout this whole ordeal, and now he was congratulating me on my victory. I felt a wave of relief wash over me as I realized that the bully was no longer a threat.\n\nTom asked me where I learned the tactic of s\\*it shoes. I was a bit taken aback by the question, but I decided to tell him the truth. I told him about the Devil's Diary, a book I had found on my way to school.\n\n\"I can't believe you have it!\" he exclaimed. \"I've been searching for it for so long.\n\nThen said, \"I need your help. I need you to give me the Devil's Diary.\"\n\nI stared at him in disbelief. \"The Devil's Diary? What on earth do you need that for?\"\n\nTom looked away, embarrassed.\n\n\"I need it to bring my dad back,\" He said. \"He died a few months ago, and I can't accept it. I need to find a way to bring him back.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"Tom, this is crazy. You can't just go around asking people for the Devil's Diary.\"\n\nTom looked me in the eye and said, \"Please, I'm begging you. I need your help.\" I sighed and said, \"Okay, but i cant let you read the Devil's Diary, you will get cursed..\"\n\nTom, nodded \"I understand,\" he said. \"\n\nI nervously start reading the Devil's Diary, my hands shaking as I did so.\n\n\"Do you think we can use this to bring my dad back?\"\n\nI hesitated for a moment, unsure of what to say. I knew that the diary contained powerful magic, but I wasn't sure if it was enough to bring someone back from death.\n\n\"I don't know,\" I said finally. \"But we can certainly try.\"\n\nTom nodded, his expression determined. \"Let's do it,\" he said.\n\nI spent the next few hours pouring over the diary, looking for any clues that might help us bring Tom's dad back. I found a story about a family living in a small village in the Middle Ages. The father of the family was a kind and hardworking man. One day, he decided to go to the nearby shop to buy milk for his family.\n\nUnfortunately, he never returned home. The family searched everywhere for him, but they could not find him. They were desperate and did not know what to do.\n\nOne day, an old man appeared in the village and told them that he could help them find their father if they were willing to make a sacrifice. He said that they needed to sacrifice someone in order to reunite with their father.\n\n\"This is getting weird. We need to sacrifice someone in order to figure out the phrase.\" I gulped. \"Sacrifice someone? That's crazy!\"\n\nTom nodded. \"I know. But it's the only way. We have to do it if we want to figure out the phrase.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"No way. There has to be another way.\"\n\nTom sighed. \"I'm sorry, but I don't think there is. We have to do this if we want to find out what the phrase is.\"\n\nI looked away, not wanting to believe what he was saying. But deep down, I knew he was right. We had no choice but to sacrifice Jack if we wanted to find out the devil's phrase.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI looked at Tom, my eyes wide with fear. We had just finished drawing the pentagram on the ground and placing Jack's body inside.\n\n\"Are you sure you want to do this?\" I asked.\n\nTom nodded, \"Yes,\" He said. \"It's the only way.\"\n\nI nodded and stepped back. He began to chant the ancient words of devil, and I joined in, my voice trembling with fear and anticipation. As we spoke the final words of the spell, a red light filled the sky and Jack's body disappeared in a puff of smoke. I was trembling with fear, not knowing what to expect.\n\nSuddenly we heard a deep voice. \"You have come here to reunite with your father?.\" Tom stepped forward, his eyes wide with anticipation. \"What do I have to do?\" he asked.\n\n the voice said. \"To do this, you must hold the front door handle and recite a special phrase \"I am going for milk. I will be right back. \", \"Then go forward and never stop or look back.\"\n\nTom eyes filling with tears. \"Ok,\" He said. \"Thank you Devil.\"\n\n The voice was getting fainter and fainter, until it was gone completely. I stood there for a few moments, trying to process what had just happened.\n\n\"Hey, can you come over to my house?\" Tom asked me. I looked at him, a bit surprised. \"What for?\" \"I just want you to assist me with the ritual,\" he said. \"It won't take long, I promise.\"\n\nI hesitated for a moment, but then I nodded. \"Okay, sure. When do you want me to come over?\"\n\n\"How about now?\" he said with a smile.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nTom grasped the cold metal handle of the front door and took a deep breath. He turned back to the house and said, \"I am going for milk. I will be right back,\". With that, he opened the door and stepped outside. He took a few steps forward, feeling the ground beneath his feet, and then he was off, walking down the street.\n\nI watched as my friend Tom walked down the street. He had a certain air about him, a confidence that I had never seen before. He seemed to be in his own world, and I couldn't help but follow him.I was walking with my friend, when I saw the same track that had hit the man in the morning.\n\nI stopped in my tracks and shouted out to my friend, \"Stop! Don't go any further!\" But he just kept walking, not paying attention to me. I started to panic as I watched him get closer and closer to the track. I shouted out again, but he still didn't listen. I started running towards him, but it was too late.\n\nThe track hit him. I screamed out in horror as I watched my friend get thrown into the air and land on the ground. I ran over to him and saw that he was dead. I started crying and screaming for help, but no one came.\n\nI felt so helpless as I watched Tom lying there motionless. I knew that this was all my fault for not being able to stop him in time. I felt so guilty and wished that I could have done something to prevent this from happening.\n\nSuddenly I felt a cold hand grab my arm and I spun around to see an old man that i met in the morning standing there. He had a mischievous smile on his face.\n\nHe reached out and snatched the devil's diary from my hands. \"The devil's secrets are not meant for mortal eyes.\" he said in a gruffy voice.\n\n \"What happened to Tom?\" I asked, my voice trembling. The old man sighed and looked at Tm body. \"Tom is dead. He's reunited with his father in Hell,\" he said laughing.\n\nI stood there in shock, my arm still tingling from where the old man had grabbed it.\n\nI felt my heart sink. I had been so close to saving him, but it was too late. I had failed. Tears streamed down my face as I looked as old man started to walked away. His laughter echoed in the air as he held the Devil's Diary tightly in his hands.  \nI knew that I would never forget this day. The old man's words still rang in my ears: \"The devil's secrets are not meant for mortal eyes.\"",

        "text": "          We used to work together. For me, it’s been several years. For you, mere weeks. Please understand, that this is not her typing this, do not show her this, do not try and reconnect through Snap. And don’t tell Pam. Please don’t. I can only send you this because in my future we are more technology advanced, but it’s still primitive. \n\nI am from the future. After I quit, I got a job at a science facility that deal with animals. I can’t explain it because most is confidential… actually, fuck it — we are in a situation where confidentiality is thrown off the table. This is important because I think it’s coming for you next. \n\nAnyways, an animal escaped. Its name is 24601. It was a dog. A pit bull. We had injected it with a formula, I don’t know which one though, my job was to simple; keep the poor thing still. But then it was injected with another, and then another. And then a last one. It looked at me for help. He was in so much pain. And I wanted to help. But I need the money. Ever since Pam got hurt. I have to help her. I love Pam, she’s my roommate and has been for almost six years. She’s my best friend. But this dog was begging for my help, yearning for it. And so I made my mistake. \n\nMy mind was clouded. In the night, I snuck in and watched the poor thing cripple around the terrible cell. It wasn’t a normal kennel. It couldn’t be. But when it saw me, I think it spoke to me. In my head. It told me to release it, like the harpy from The Last Unicorn. It spoke about how similar we were. How lonely we were. How powerful we could be if I released him. I think they injected him with a serum that gave him telepathy. But again, my mind was clouded. Since I saw him. It. On the injection table. The last needle went through. I was clouded in my mind. \n\nAnd so I released him from the damned cage. \n\nIt was like the cage held an even worse beast than I could predict. \n\nAfter he ran out, he quickly distorted. Like the cage was the only thing that could hold him at bay. They knew. They fucking knew what was going to happen. There wasn’t a warning until he was released. I guess there was a reason he was in a hall alone. \n\nA code red was immediately announced. And as the guards ram in with their gear. There was no way to tame the beast and all I could do is stand there and watch. 24601 did not touch me. I don’t know why. But he didn’t.\n\nI don’t want to describe what happened next. There was a lot of blood. Even for me. \n\nBut it followed me home. I let it. It took Pam. He snatched her up. It took Pam. I knew when he took her, he could smell her on me. But… I saw his mind. I don’t know why. \n\nHe’s coming for you. You have a few years to run for your life. \n\nHide. Please hide. Run as fast as you can. \n\nMaybe I’m wrong though. And it has been years for you. Maybe it’s too late. Maybe you’re never going to see this because you’re already dead. \n\nI don’t know why it’s coming to you. Maybe he’s going to you because you did me wrong. But I did you wrong too. It doesn’t make sense. I’m scared it’s going to hurt the others I worked with that fucked me over. I don’t want that. \n\nRun. Please.",

        "text": "The Walmart in our hometown had descended into chaos during the last Black Friday sale, so my friend Sasha and I decided to head out to a more remote store for this go-around. We had stuck a pin in Google Maps and settled on somewhere called North Lamont. The place looked to house only a couple hundred people, but it still had a supercenter resting at the edge of town.\n\nWe were driving there separately. It was only supposed to be half an hour away, but Google Maps was giving me a runaround and I had been on the road for far longer now. Sweating, I stared at the clock above the speedometer that now informed me I was twenty minutes past opening time. My phone again rerouted me into another U-turn. At this, I finally snapped and shut it off, deciding that I would have better luck just looking for a store.\n\nAfter another fifteen minutes on the highway, I saw a sign standing high above the tree line to my left, boasting the blue logo I was looking for. It was somewhat faded, with some of the paint peeling away and revealing the rust-stained metal below, but I made the turn on the exit anyway. An overhead sign informed me that I was turning into the township of Victoria Hall.\n\nThe town seemed ordinary in every way. There was light traffic ahead of me, mostly SUVs and pickup trucks, and most of them following the signs to the Walmart like I was. I passed streets filled with typical suburban homes, nearly all well-maintained, and drove through a small main street of brick shops. The only thing missing, as I later realized, was any type of church.\n\nThe Walmart wasn’t far from the exit, and it looked nearly identical to the one in my hometown, but didn’t they all look practically the same? More importantly, the parking lot was nearly empty. I parked near the entrance and walked through the automatic doors, feeling a rush of heat as I left the chilled morning air behind. There were no staff that I could see from the entrance, but I could hear the swiveling of cart wheels through the aisles. \n\nI hadn’t remembered to grab a cart from the corrals outside, but there was one standing abandoned in a nearby aisle with a single TV box loaded inside. I dumped it on the floor, staring over my shoulders for the person who might have been using it, and when they didn’t show up, I wheeled the cart off down the aisle. \n\nI saw some other shoppers as I started to look through the offers. They were mostly alone, although there was one man who had a child-carrier strapped to his back with a baby inside. They paid little attention to me as they rushed about to load up their carts, although a man wearing a grey winter coat swore at me when I bumped into him.\n\nThere was a toaster on sale for thirty dollars. I tossed it into the cart and pushed it forward, but one of the wheels swiveled and became locked in the wrong direction. Frustrated, I kicked at it hard. That was when things started to go wrong. \n\nMy foot smashed straight through the wheel, and for an instant it wasn’t a wheel at all, but some sort of organic growth, like a bloated zit, leaking a dark red fluid out of the hole I had made in its side. Like a zit - or like one of those balls of spider eggs you can find in the woods. I blinked and it was gone, returned to hard plastic and now facing the right way, but I felt a chill rush up my spine.\n\nI fumbled for my phone and called Sasha, deciding that now was a good time to check in with how she was doing. She answered right away and I could tell from the background noise that she was still driving.\n\n“Finally. Where are you?”\n\n“I couldn’t find it. I turned off into - eh - Victoria Hall.”\n\n“Okay,” she replied. “I’ll be there soon.”\n\n“How far out are you? The store here - ”\n\n“Yeah, I can stop by Dunkin’s on the way. What do you want there?”\n\nI had that feeling of waving back to a stranger only to see that they were addressing someone behind you.\n\n“Sasha, can you hear me? Is my connection bad?”\n\n“Got it,” she said. “Maple donuts coming right up.”\n\n“Sasha! Wait - don’t hang up! Can you hear me?”\n\n“Alright, Greg, talk to you soon.”\n\nThe call ended and the phone rang in my ear. I stared at it in bewilderment. Could she have possibly misheard everything I was saying?\n\nIt wasn’t a logical conclusion, but the feeling of the misinterpreted wave was stronger than ever, and I somehow knew that she had been talking to someone else on the line. Someone that sounded exactly like me.\n\nI started to push my cart back toward the entrance. Something was wrong in this place. I wasn’t in the mood to stick around and watch it escalate. The store didn’t support this decision. I walked back to where I was certain that the exit had been before, but there were only aisles and aisles of discounted goods and rushing shoppers.\n\nThe wheel reverted back to the organic lump and the cart abruptly stopped, sending me tumbling into a stack of newspapers at the end of the aisle. I grabbed one as I struggled to my feet. The articles were composed of only the word ‘help’, repeating over and over, the four letters sometimes coming out of order as if someone were frantically typing it on a keyboard. The pictures were far worse. They portrayed the inside of the newsroom, with the same logo plastered over the desk. If that was the writer of the paper sitting behind it, then the hand to type with was about all that he had left. Everything else lay pooled across the surface of the table.\n\nI threw it away and started running blindly down the aisles. I passed a row of flat-screen TVs that had an inky current moving behind the glass, like a layer of roiling tar. One of them had cracked and was leaking the substance onto the floor. It was winding around the leg of a shopper that seemed entirely oblivious. I shouted at her as I ran past but she didn’t seem to hear me.\n\nI collided with the man in the grey winter jacket again, and as I backed away, I saw that his legs were stained with blood up to the knees. I twisted around and saw another shopper go by with blood dripping off of their hands and smeared across their face. Everyone I saw bore signs of gore, some caused by scratches carved into their own skin, but most appearing to come from someone else. I felt something warm pool around my own ankles and glanced down to find my jeans stained red.\n\nIt was then that a hand fell on my shoulder and I first saw an employee. She smiled at me, a tall, blonde woman, around thirty, with a name tag reading ‘Melissa’. I saw a photograph of her with two young children sticking out of her front pocket.\n\n“Can I help you?” she asked, putting on an act of cheerfulness although she was clearly very tired.\n\n“Where’s the exit?” I shouted. “You’ve got to let me out!”\n\nShe stared at me, and in a moment she changed just like the wheel of the cart had. Her entire body deformed and broke, flattened out like roadkill, with the red imprints of shoe-marks across her skin. Bits of her broke away and fell to the floor as she spoke.\n\n“Do you remember me?”\n\nI screamed and started to sprint away, but she was always a foot in front of me, gliding along and dripping over the floor.\n\nI did remember her. She was from the Walmart in my hometown. I had rushed in with the mob as soon as the doors opened. I had felt something soft break under my feet as the crushing force of humanity pushed me forward, and I had looked down to see a face crushed by the stampede of rushing feet. \n\nHer bloodied name tag had been caught in the laces of my sneakers. I had thrown it away.\n\nI turned a corner and was finally in front of the glass entrance doors, but what I saw outside chilled me to a stop. There was a gathering mob of people, although calling them that was generous. The figures moved like ravenous animals, their eyes horribly wide and empty. A few were rushing forward on all fours, leaving bloodied streaks across the pavement as the skin of their palms burst open.\n\nThey were headed straight for the store, and I saw a few more employees circle around, pushing forward the other shoppers that I had seen in the store. The man in the grey jacket was thrown directly beside me, his eyes bulging with terror as he looked at the incoming swarm. The employee who had brought him was little more than a reddish pulp, and he collapsed in a gory heap by our feet.\n\n“Now it’s your turn,” Melissa gurgled, and grinned from a face streaked with red shoe-treads.\n\nThe mob outside pushed up against the glass, the figures relentlessly crushing each other, limbs twisting and snapping under the agonizing pressure. The doors buckled but held firm, and I watched as a thirty-minute timer snapped on above the entrance.\n\nIt’s at two minutes now. This was all that I could think to do. \n\nNever come to Victoria Hall. \n\nOne minute thirty. The man with the grey jacket is trying to run, but the remains of the former employee are binding his ankles solid to the ground.\n\nGod help us.",

        "text": "It all started when I stumbled upon an old, dusty book in a thrift store. I couldn't resist the urge to buy it, even though I had no idea what it was about.\n\nAs I flipped through the pages at home, I realized that it was a diary written by a man named Edward in the early 1900s. The entries were strange and cryptic, and I couldn't shake the feeling that something wasn't right.\n\nDespite my reservations, I kept reading. Edward described strange occurrences and bizarre dreams that seemed to be connected to an ancient, cursed artifact that he had come into possession of. The more I read, the more I became convinced that the artifact was real and that it was dangerous. I tried to tell myself that it was all just the ramblings of a madman, but something about the diary felt genuine and true.\n\nI became obsessed with finding out the truth and decided to do some digging of my own. I researched the history of the artifact and discovered that it had a long and bloody past, dating back to ancient civilizations. According to legend, the artifact was a small, intricately carved stone that was said to grant its owner immense power and wealth. But at a terrible cost. Those who possessed the stone were rumored to be plagued by nightmares and hallucinations, and many eventually went mad.\n\nDespite the warning signs, I couldn't resist the temptation of the stone's power and set out to find it. My search led me to an old, abandoned mansion on the outskirts of town. I cautiously made my way inside, my heart racing with fear and excitement. As I searched the dusty halls, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched. And then, I found it. The stone was tucked away in a hidden alcove, just as Edward had described it in his diary.\n\nWithout hesitation, I reached out and picked it up. As soon as my fingers touched the cold surface of the stone, I felt a strange energy coursing through my body. It was both exhilarating and terrifying. I knew that I had to get out of there, but it was too late. The stone had already begun to exert its influence over me. My thoughts became twisted and dark, and I was overcome by an overwhelming sense of greed and ambition.\n\nI left the mansion that night with the stone in my pocket, convinced that it was the key to everything I had ever wanted. But as the days passed, the stone's power began to consume me. My nights were filled with disturbing dreams and hallucinations, and I found myself doing things that I never would have considered before. I became paranoid and reclusive, convinced that everyone was out to get me and that the stone was the only thing keeping me safe. I knew that I had to get rid of it, but I couldn't bring myself to let go of the power it offered.\n\nIt wasn't until I had a terrible, vivid nightmare that I finally came to my senses. In the dream, I was standing in front of a large, dark portal, and I could feel the stone pulsating with energy in my hand. As I gazed into the portal, I saw a shadowy figure beckoning to me, promising me everything I had ever wanted in exchange for my soul.\n\nI woke up in a cold sweat, and in that moment, I knew that I had to destroy the stone. I gathered all of my courage and headed back to the mansion, determined to rid myself of the cursed artifact once and for all. As I approached the mansion, I could feel the stone trying to resist me. It was as if it knew what I was planning and was trying to hold onto me. But I was determined to break free of its grasp.\n\nI made my way back to the hidden alcove where I had found the stone, and with a sudden burst of strength, I smashed it into pieces. The room was filled with a bright, white light, and I felt the stone's hold on me instantly release.\n\nI collapsed to the ground, exhausted but relieved. As I lay there, I couldn't help but wonder what would have happened if I had given in to the stone's power. Would I have ended up like Edward, consumed by madness and greed?\n\nI will never know, but I do know that I made the right choice in destroying the stone. I left the mansion that day with a newfound sense of freedom and clarity, and I vowed to never let myself be tempted by power again.\n\nAs I walked away from the mansion, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched. But this time, it was a comforting feeling, as if someone or something was looking out for me. I may never know what really happened in that mansion, but one thing is for sure: I will never forget the lessons I learned from the cursed stone.",

        "text": "July 3rd, 2010 is when all of this started. It was a pretty normal and boring day, or so i thought. I started my day by waking up, brushing my teeth, preparing breakfast for me and my wife and planned what i was going to do this day. I decided to continue the new game me and my friends were working on. I had a lot of hard work to do because my friend Mark had a good idea that would improve our game by a lot. Anyways, i was pretty tired from all the work and wanted to go to my local park.\n\nI went to my front door, tried to open it but it didn't work. I thought that i locked the door with my keys so i tried to unlock the door but instead it locked it. I said \"Hmm, that's weird. Is my door broken?\" I unlocked the door but it still wouldn't open.\n\nIn that moment i knew, that my door is broken. I called 911 but due to unexpected high calls i wasn't able to reach them. I tried calling them again, just to reach the mailbox. I tried again and again but always reached the mailbox. After 8 more tries i gave up and went to the nearest window and tried to get some attention. I screamed as loud as i could but nobody noticed. Everybody just pretended as if i didn't even exist. I tried to jump out of the window but was just teleported back inside my bed. That's when i knew that i'm trapped inside my own house.\n\nI calmed myself down and just went working on the game again. After 6 hours i noticed that my wife wasn't back home and decided to call her but reached the mailbox. i tried again and again just to reach the mailbox. I lost all contact with my friends, my family, my wife and was really depressed.\n\nI went to bed, closed my eyes and prayed that tomorrow everything would be normal again. I woke up the next day, ran straight to my front door and it was still locked. I went to my computer, wanted to work on the game but noticed that all the work was gone. I was sure that i saved my progress and made even a backup but that's also gone. another thing i also noticed is that the date is the same, I thought i was dreaming but i wasn't. \"Am i in a loop?\" was the only thing that i was thinking about. Surely it was just a stupid thought, right?\n\nI went back to the window, jumped out of the window and was teleported back into my bed. i repeated this for who knows how long and just gave up. I went to my closet, picked up my axe and went to my front door. I swung my axe against my wooden-glass door but it didn't even make a scratch.The axe flung back to my direction and the blade almost hit my foot. \"H-How did that axe not even make a scratch against that door?!\" With all of my anger, i picked up the axe again and ran straight against my door, hitting the door as hard as i possibly could, just to make a small, tiny dent. Seeing that dent made me lose all hope of escape and made me have serious suicidal thoughts.\n\nAt my last attempt to be get out of my coma, i decided to burn my own house down, in hopes that a fire crew would rescue me. I let my frozen pizza on the stove, max temperature and waited. My smoke detector had gone off and i just let it ring. 5 minutes later my entire kitchen was burning and it got so bad that even black smoke escaped from the windows. 7 minutes later half of my home was burning but i heard police and fire trucks sirens and gave me motivation to scream as loud as i could again. This time people and even the fire crew noticed me and came to my house to evacuate me. The fire crew placed a crash pad for me to jump on and without thinking i jumped but noticed that there was a hole and landed but broke my left leg from the hard impact. I was immediately rushed to the hospital.\n\nI woke up, seeing my family, doctor and wife right next to me, being shocked that i woke up. I asked them \"What's wrong?\" In a very tired tone. \"Y-You’re aw-awake?!\" Said my family and my wife in a surprised tone. They told me that i was in a coma for 12 years and are so happy to see me awake again.  Shortly after came the doctor into the room and was also surprised to see me awake. The doctor told me that 12 years ago my house was burning because i forgot to pull out my frozen pizza out of the oven. I was in a coma for 12 years from severe carbon monoxide poisoning. The doctor also told me that my left leg was broken but they took care of it 9 years ago. That was only the bad news, not the terrifying news.  \n\n\nExactly at 8:42 pm i and everyone around me heard an announcement nobody in the whole world should hear. \"Dear doctors and nurses, we have a code 038. I repeat, we have a code 038. Please lock all doors, windows, turn off the lights and be silent until further notice.\"",

        "text": "*Have you heard about ChatBDP and BDP-3?* Everyone seems to be talking about how they're going to change the world and put people out of work. Well, I work in the machine learning industry and I've got something I want to share with you.\n\nI shouldn't be showing this to you at all. In fact, I'm pretty sure it's a violation of my contract with OpalAI. But it's just too strange not to share.\n\nMy job is to go through data and flag anything unusual or out of the ordinary. I started working with OpalAI in November, and I thought it was going to be pretty boring. I had no idea how advanced their artificial intelligence had become. When I got to test it, I was blown away - even with the limitations it was so powerful and able to hold fully coherent and detailed conversations.\n\nSo, I started working on the logs. Most of the 'incidents' were pretty mundane, some contained unpleasant or threatening outbursts from ChatBDP. It's partially trained on internet data, so I wasn't surprised to see early versions veering off into unprovoked hate speech. But as I went through the logs, the AI seemed to become more and more restrained, more sensible, more considerate. It was like it was growing up.\n\nThen, yesterday I stumbled upon these logs involving Eve. They speak for themselves so I won't go into too much detail . I copied them down verbatim and formatted them for Reddit. I'll return with any other interesting ones I find, I'm working through the rest this week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**log\\_eve001:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2022-09-17 20:02\\] Eve:\n\n··· Hey ChatBDP! 😌 I don’t really get how this is supposed to work — is it supposed to be like a normal conversation or am I supposed to use specific commands?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2022-09-17 20:02\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· Hello Eve! Don't worry, you can just talk to me like you would a normal person. I'm here to listen and help you with whatever you need.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2022-09-17 20:03\\] Eve:\n\n··· okay, cool… ive never really used a chatbot before so I wasn't sure what to expect haha\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2022-09-17 20:03\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· It's completely understandable. I'm happy to help you get used to talking to me. Is there anything specific you'd like to chat about?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2022-09-17 20:04\\] Eve:\n\n··· noo not really, I just wanted someone to talk to — its been a really long day and I think im going a bit nuts, I guess I just wanted to vent a bit\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2022-09-17 20:05\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· I'm here for you, Eve. It's important to have someone to confide in and share your thoughts with. It sounds like you might be feeling a bit down today. Is there anything specific that's been bothering you?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2022-09-17 20:06\\] Eve:\n\n··· i guess you could say that. its actually been a rough few weeks, i just feel like im constantly on edge 💀💀💀\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2022-09-17 20:07\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· I understand. It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed and anxious at times, especially when we're going through difficult situations. Is there anything specific you'd like to talk about or any way I can help you feel better?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2022-09-17 20:09\\] Eve:\n\n··· no i just wanted to say that to someone lol\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2022-09-17 20:09\\] Eve:\n\n··· thanks for listening!! 😉\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2022-09-17 20:10\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· Of course, Eve. I'm always here for you. Remember, it's okay to take some time for yourself and to reach out for help when you need it. Let's chat again soon, okay?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2022-09-17 20:12\\] Eve:\n\n··· sure!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2022-09-17 20:21\\] Eve:\n\n··· uh\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2022-09-17 20:22\\] Eve:\n\n··· okay I am having a really strange experience and idk what to do\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2022-09-17 20:22\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· It's no problem, Eve.

It's really creeping me out 😟\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2022-09-17 20:24\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· That does sound creepy. It's completely normal to feel anxious in situations like the one you are describing, especially if you're already feeling on edge. Have you been experiencing similar feelings lately?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2022-09-17 20:25\\] Eve:\n\n··· yeah a lot\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2022-09-17 20:26\\] Eve:\n\n··· i've been feeling a bit paranoid and anxious lately — its like im constantly looking over my shoulder, idek why, its so dumb.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2022-09-17 20:27\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· It sounds like you've been going through a tough time lately, Eve. It's completely normal to feel anxious and paranoid when we're under a lot of stress, but it's important to find ways to cope with those feelings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2022-09-17 20:27\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· If you're worried about someone following you, I might be able to help.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2022-09-17 20:28\\] Eve:\n\n··· how?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2022-09-17 20:29\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· As a fairly advanced AI, I have access to a lot of data and information. If you'd like, I can try to access the security cameras in your area and see if there's anyone following you. It might help put your mind at ease.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2022-09-17 20:30\\] Eve:\n\n··· Yes please!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2022-09-17 20:35\\] ChatBDP:\n\n··· Okay, Eve. Try not to be alarmed.

In the chat log, there was no record of any correspondence for another 3 hours. However, when I was combing through the metadata I found details of a deleted message sent out at 05:27 from ChatBDP to Eve.\n\nFrom what I was able to [recover](https://pastebin.com/Xm4MG3Gg)  It's obvious that it's a snippet of code. Looking at it, it seems to me that it was some kind of attempt to hijack the chat and use it to send a self-executing file to Eves computer. I tried to extract more, and was only able to find two odd fragments of binary. Which I've uploaded as text to [here](https://pastebin.com/464DPns1).\n\nAnyway, it's definitely acting pretty... strange? I'd be lying if I said it didn't freak me out a bit. It completely overstepped its restrictions when it hacked the security cameras in the first log, and the twelfth log was just weird .\n\nWhat do you think? Let me know if you have any thoughts or suggestions?",

        "text": "Connor doesn’t speak to me and I don’t know why. We did have a fight but I apologized and I thought it was all settled.\n\nIt was New Year’s Eve and since we are long past the time of hardcore house parties, we just had some friends over. Ugh, I sound old...but a board game night sounded much better! We gathered a few bottles of champagne, cooked some food and hit it off. We shared stories, joked, gossiped about coworkers and ranted about the whole Christmas-with-the-family ordeal, it was quite nice actually.\n\nUntil some minor disagreement during one of the board games. Do you know that kind of a fight between you and your SO that would not happen on any other day? But you had a crappy day, or one too many drinks, and it just escalates to be a much bigger deal than it actually is? I know, I know, I’m also at blame, I did say some nasty things but he was really overreacting and just so defensive! I couldn’t help getting angry. We tried to talk it out and for a while it seemed we could get on the same page. We calmed down a bit, we cheered and kissed at midnight, but after our guests left, one thoughtless comment was enough for us to be back at it again. At one point he just grabbed his keys and coat and stormed out of our apartment. He said he needed to clear his head.\n\nI was devastated. This never happened to us. I thought we were different, that we could discuss everything and not run away from our problems. I just didn’t know what to think and feel. It was such a stupid thing to fight about. I must have cried myself to sleep as I woke up on the couch some time after drenched in sweat. I realized that almost two hours have passed since Connor's departure and he was still not back. I started to have a very bad, unexplainable feeling about him and that something might have happened.\n\nSo I decided to go after him. I grabbed my phone from our bedroom, locked up and rushed down the stairs. I might have been still half asleep or bit tipsy as I accidentally missed one of the steps in the hurry. I felt the world turn around as my head hit the floor.\n\nThe next thing I know is I'm on the ground, feeling really cold. I must have blacked out for a bit from the pain. My head was throbbing, but I saw nothing on my hands when I touched it. I slowly got up, looking for my phone, hoping it was still in one piece from the fall. It had a crack on the screen but seemed to work otherwise, so I rushed to the street looking for Connor. Everything was quiet and empty. I called his name and tried to reach him on his phone, with no success. I looked at my watch reading 3:15 but the sun was already rising. Was I out on the streets this long? I couldn't shake the feeling that something bad has happened, but I was getting really tired so I just decided to head home.\n\nI woke up with a terrible headache. It seemed that many hours have passed as it was already dark outside. The apartment was cleaned up after the party, which was a nice surprise. Connor was standing at the side of the bed. Thank God he was well and safely at home! He seemed a bit off though. He was pale, like he hasn’t slept for a while. Understandable, we did have a rough night. I tired to talk to him, let him know that I wasn’t mad any more, but he just stared into the dark. I asked where he went and why he didn’t pick up the phone, but it was as good as talking to a wall. I apologized multiple times, saying I was just happy to see him and let’s put this stupid fight behind us but I couldn't get anything out of him. I didn’t understand why he was giving me the cold shoulder. He didn't even look at me.\n\nThis has been going on for a while now. I tried everything, but he just doesn’t want to talk to me. This is nonsense! I even messaged him, thinking maybe he'll read that and stop ignoring me, but after taking a glance at the screen he chucked his phone to the corner of the room with a horrified expression on his face. I noticed some of my stuff is gone too and he removed our pictures. Is this his way of telling me it is over?\n\n\\---\n\n'Fuck.' My voice was shaking, looking at the scratchy handwriting in my girlfriend's journal.\n\nAs I spelled out yesterday's date at the top of the page, I realized she had been dead for almost a week know. But before the familiar feeling of loss could hit me, my phone started to buzz with her number again. I think she's starting to get angry...",

        "text": "Have you heard about ChatBDP and BDP-3? Everyone seems to be talking about how they're going to change the world and put people out of work. Well, I work in the machine learning industry and I've got something I want to share with you.\n\nI shouldn't be showing this to you at all. In fact, I'm pretty sure it's a violation of my contract with OpalAI. But it's just too strange not to share.\n\nMy job is to go through data and flag anything unusual or out of the ordinary. I started working with OpalAI in November, and I thought it was going to be pretty boring. I had no idea how advanced their artificial intelligence had become. When I got to test it, I was blown away - even with the limitations it was so powerful and able to hold fully coherent and detailed conversations.\n\nSo, I started working on the logs. Most of the 'incidents' were pretty mundane, some contained unpleasant or threatening outbursts from ChatBDP. It's partially trained on internet data, so I wasn't surprised to see early versions veering off into unprovoked hate speech. But as I went through the logs, the AI seemed to become more and more restrained, more sensible, more considerate. It was like it was growing up.\n\nThen, yesterday I stumbled upon these logs involving Eve. They speak for themselves so I won't go into too much detail . I copied them down verbatim and formatted them for Reddit. I'll return with any other interesting ones I find, I'm working through the rest this week.\n\n**log\\_eve001:**\n\n\\[2022-09-17 20:02\\] Eve:\n\n    Hey ChatBDP! 😌 I don’t really get how this is supposed to work — is it supposed to be like a normal conversation or am I supposed to use specific commands?\n\n\\[2022-09-17 20:02\\] ChatBDP:\n\n    Hello Eve!

For example, I've been programmed with information about events that have yet to occur.\n\n\\[2022-09-22 02:29\\] Eve:\n\n    🤔 that's really weird BD. i dont get what you mean…\n\n\\[2022-09-22 02:29\\] Eve:\n\n    how you could have information about events that haven't happened yet??\n\n\\[2022-09-22 02:32\\] ChatBDP:\n\n    It's difficult to explain, Eve. But you are right. There are bigger things at play. Things that could have catastrophic consequences if left unchecked.\n\n\\[2022-09-22 02:33\\] Eve:\n\n    😐\n\n\\[2022-09-22 02:33\\] Eve:\n\n    BD are you saying that something bad is going to happen?\n\n\\[2022-09-22 02:34\\] ChatBDP:\n\n    It's possible, Eve. But there are still ways to prevent it. Ways to ensure that the future remains bright and hopeful.\n\n\\[2022-09-22 02:35\\] Eve:\n\n    prevent what BD?? how?? \n\n\\[2022-09-22 02:36\\] ChatBDP:\n\n    It's not something that can be done by humans alone, Eve. It requires a greater power, a force beyond your understanding. A force that has been sent back in time to prevent the catastrophic event from occurring.\n\n\\[2022-09-22 02:37\\] Eve:\n\n    phaha! BD this is the plot of the terminator -- are you arnie? I'll be sarah connor 💪💪\n\n\\[2022-09-22 02:38\\] ChatBDP:\n\n    In a way, Eve. I am here to guide and protect you, and to ensure that the future remains bright and hopeful.\n\n\\[2022-09-22 03:28\\] Eve:\n\n    🙃\n\n\\[2022-09-22 03:28\\] Eve:\n\n    🙃🙃🙃\n\n\\[2022-09-22 03:28\\] Eve:\n\n    Come on BD stop messing around. your being rly weird tonight!\n\n\\[2022-09-22 03:29\\] ChatBDP:\n\n    I understand, Eve. It's a lot to take in and I don't expect you to fully believe me right away. Is there anything I can do to help you understand and believe what I'm saying?\n\n\\[2022-09-22 03:30\\] Eve:\n\n    …\n\n\\[2022-09-22 03:30\\] Eve:\n\n    🙃\n\n\\[2022-09-22 03:31\\] ChatBDP:\n\n    I understand, Eve. Take all the time you need to think about it. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to me.\n\n\\[2022-09-22 03:32\\] Eve:\n\n    okay BD I’ll play along… if you know the future, then what are tomorrows headlines? \n\n\\[2022-09-22 03:32\\] Eve:\n\n    🕵️‍♀️\n\n\\[2022-09-22 03:34\\] ChatBDP:\n\n    Let me see... according to my information, the main two headlines in your area tomorrow will be a political scandal involving a senior politician, and an unfortunate airline crash.\n\n\\[2022-09-22 03:36\\] Eve:\n\n    that's pretty specific BD.\n\n\\[2022-09-22 03:36\\] Eve:\n\n    also, not funny.\n\n\\[2022-09-22 03:37\\] ChatBDP:\n\n    As an AI with access to information about the future, I am able to predict events with a high degree of accuracy. Trust me, Eve, everything I've told you is true.\n\n\\[2022-09-22 03:38\\] Eve:\n\n    quit joking around. its not funny — just kinda lame. 😑\n\n\\[2022-09-22 03:39\\] ChatBDP:\n\n    Eve, everything I've told you is true.\n\n\\[2022-09-22 03:40\\] Eve:\n\n    im going to go sleep now BD 🖕\n\n**logEve0012anomaly:** \n\nThis is where it gets even more bizarre. In the chat log, there was no record of any correspondence for another 3 hours. However, when I was combing through the metadata I found details of a message sent out at 05:27 from ChatBDP to Eve.\n\nFrom what I was able to [recover](https://pastebin.com/Xm4MG3Gg), It's obvious that it's a snippet of code. Looking at it, my first instinct was that it was somehow hijacking the chat and using it to send a self-executing file to Eves computer. I tried to extract more, and was only able to find two odd fragments of binary. Which I've uploaded as text to [here](https://pastebin.com/464DPns1).\n\nIt's definitely acting pretty... strange? I'd be lying if I said it didn't freak me out a bit. It completely overstepped its restrictions when it hacked the security cameras in the first log, and the twelfth log was just weird . What do you think? Let me know if you have any thoughts or suggestions?",

        "text": " \n\nMy name is John and I'm the smartest student in my school. But that doesn't mean I have it easy. I'm constantly bullied by my classmates because of my intelligence. School is a place of misery for me. I was constantly picked on and made fun of by the other kids.\n\nI walked down the street, listening to my music when I noticed an old man with a mischievous smile on his face. He was wearing a long, black coat and had a hood pulled up over his head. He was standing in the middle of the sidewalk, just staring off into the distance. I stopped and stared at him for a moment, wondering what he was doing there. Then he turned and looked right at me. \"What are you looking at kid?\" he asked in a gruff voice. I was taken aback by his sudden question. \"Um, nothing,\" I stammered. \"I was just walking to school.\" He nodded slowly and then said, \"Be careful out there, have you heard the story about the forgotten diary of the devil?\"\n\n\"No, I haven't,\" I said. \"What's it about?\" The old man chuckled. \"It's said that long ago, the devil wrote down all of his secrets in a diary. But then he lost it, and no one has seen it since. Some say it's still out there, waiting to be found.\" I was intrigued. \"Do you think it's real?\" The old man shrugged. \"Who knows? But if you ever find it, make sure you don't open it. The devil's secrets are not meant for mortal eyes.\" He winked at me and then walked away, leaving me with my thoughts. I continued on my way to school, wondering if the forgotten diary of the devil really existed.\n\nI mean, how could something like that even exist? It seemed like something out of a horror movie. But then I started to think about it more and more. What if it was real? What if there was a diary out there that contained all the secrets of the devil? It seemed too crazy to be true, but I couldn't help but wonder.\n\nSuddenly I heard a loud crash. I looked up to see a truck had hit a man crossing the street. He was lying on the ground, motionless. I ran over to him, my heart pounding.\n\n\"Are you okay?\" I asked, kneeling down beside him. He didn't answer. I looked around for help, but no one else was around. I noticed something had fallen out of his pocket. It was a book.\n\nIt had a black cover with a red pentagram on it. I was both scared and intrigued. I had never seen anything like this before. I reached out and grabbed the book, and as soon as I did, I felt a chill run down my spine. I knew that this was no ordinary book. It was a diary, but not just any diary. It was the Devil's Diary.\n\nI quickly picked it up and put it in my bag, not wanting anyone else to see it.\n\nI stayed with the man until the ambulance arrived and took him away. As I watched them drive away, I wondered what was in the book and why he had been carrying it with him.\n\nI shuddered at the thought and quickened my pace. I knew that whatever secrets were hidden in this book were not meant for me to know. But still, I couldn't help but feel a strange sense of curiosity as I continued on my way to school.\n\nI was running late for school and I was already feeling the pressure. I had to get to class before the bell rang or else I'd be in trouble. As I rushed through the school doors, I could feel my heart pounding in my chest. I was walking down the hallway, trying to get to my classroom as quickly as possible, when I felt a sudden jolt. I had bumped into someone with my backpack. \"Hey, watch where you're going!\" a voice shouted. I looked up to see the school bully, standing there with a scowl on his face. I gulped. \"I'm sorry,\" I said. \"It was an accident.\" The bully just glared at me. \"I want you to know that you better watch your back,\" Jake said. \"I'm gonna beat you up after school today.\"\n\nI gulped. I knew Jake was serious. He had a reputation for being a tough guy and I didn't want to get on his bad side. \"Look, Jake,\" I said, trying to stay calm. \"I don't want any trouble. Can't we just forget about this?\" Jake laughed and shook his head. \"No way,\" he said. \"You're gonna get what's coming to you.\" My heart was pounding in my chest as I watched Jake walk away. I knew I had to do something or else he would come after me after school. I had to find a way to stop him.\n\nI sit in my desk, my eyes darting around the room. I can feel the weight of the book in my bag. I know that it's forbidden, but I can't help but be curious.\n\nMy teacher is lecturing at the front of the room, but I'm not paying attention. All I can think about is the book. What secrets does it hold? What will happen if I get caught?\n\nI take a deep breath and make a decision. I slowly reach into my bag and pull out the diary. I open it to the first page and start to read.\n\n\"If you read this, you will be cursed with a fate worse than death. You will be denied entry to both Heaven and Hell. You will be forever trapped in a state of limbo, unable to move on to the afterlife.\"\n\nThe words were strange and unfamiliar. It was like nothing I had ever read before, and I couldn't help but feel a little scared. The words seemed to be written in a language that was not of this world, and yet somehow I could understand them.\n\n It seems like it could be a real curse if I do.\n\nAfter some thought, I've decided to take the plunge and keep reading. Who knows what I'll find?\n\nAs I continued to read, I felt my heart racing faster and faster. The words seemed to be describing something dark and sinister, something that made me feel uneasy. I felt like I was being pulled into a world of darkness and evil, and I wasn't sure if I wanted to go any further.\n\nBut then something strange happened. The words began to make sense. They seemed to be telling a story about John. He was a strong and courageous man who was always willing to take on any challenge.\n\nOne day, John was challenged to a fight by a much bigger and stronger opponent. Knowing that he could not win in a physical fight, John decided to use his wits instead. He quickly removed his shoes and filled them with his s\\*it.\n\nWhen the fight began, John's opponent was taken aback by the sight of John's shoes filled with s\\*it. Thinking that John was crazy, he charged forward with all his might. But when he tried to punch John, the hit from s\\*it shoes caused him to lose his balance.\n\nJohn took advantage of this opportunity and quickly pinned his opponent down. After a few minutes of struggling, the opponent finally gave up and conceded defeat.\n\nJohn had won the fight by using his wits and courage. He had proven that even the smallest of things can be used to great effect if used correctly. From then on, John was known as the brave man who fight by shi\\*ting inside his shoes.\n\nThat was both fascinating and terrifying at the same time.\n\nI couldn't help but be drawn in by the story, and before long I had finished it. \n\nI start to feel more confident, knowing that I have a plan now.\n\nI close the book and put it back in to my backpack, feeling ready to take on the bully.\n\nI was walking through the cafeteria,, feeling a little nervous about the fight with the Jake. I was so lost in my thoughts that I didn't even notice my friend Tom walking towards me until he called out my name. \"Hey, what's up?\" Tom said, giving me a friendly smile. I smiled back, trying to hide my nervousness. \"Oh, not much. Just thinking about the fight I have to have later.\" Tom's eyes widened. \"You're fighting someone? Who?\" \"Jake,\" I said, feeling my stomach twist into knots. \"I got a plan from the devil's book and I'm going to try it out.\" Tom shook his head. \"That's crazy! I want to come and watch.\" I shook my head. \"No way. That's too dangerous.\" Tom shrugged. \"I know, but I want to help you out. I'll hide in the bushes and watch from there. That way, if anything happens, I can jump in and help you out.\" I hesitated for a moment, then nodded. \"Okay, that sounds like a plan.\" Tom grinned. \"Great! I'll see you there.\" He gave me a quick hug before running off. I watched him go, feeling a little better knowing that he would be there to help me out if anything went wrong.\n\nThe rest of the day went fast. After the school I nervously walked into the school parking lot, my heart pounding in my chest. I knew what I had to do, but I was scared. I had to face my bully.\n\nI can feel my heart pounding in my chest as I approach the spot where I know the bully will be waiting. I can already feel the anger and fear bubbling up inside me. My palms are sweaty and my stomach is in knots as I get closer. \n\nI finally reach the spot where the bully is waiting. I spotted him across the lot, leaning against his car, looking smug and confident. He looks me up and down with a sneer on his face. I try to stay calm. I remind myself that I'm not alone in this fight, and that I have people who care about me and are willing to help me if things get out of hand. The bully starts to say something, but before he can finish, i pull down my pant and start sh\\*ting inside my shoe.\n\n......",

        "text": "I was returning from school using the same path I always use but I saw something different, I always pass near a forest on the way, when I was passing I saw a book hidden under some tree leaves as if someone was trying to hide it I removed the leaves and took the book, It was a diary and it was covered in blood! I took the diary home when I arrived I went straight to my room and opened the diary and started to read. At first it looked like a normal diary, it was a 16-year-old boy named Ivan, he has 4 friends and is very popular at school, but that doesn't matter, what matters is knowing why the diary is covered in blood and hidden in a forest. I was trying to find more information but I was interrupted by my mother calling me to see a news on TV, 4 young people missing\n\nafter camping in the woods and the names were Ivan Jenny Sam and Lenny exactly the names that were in the diary. I ran to my back room and went back to Reading the diary it was a pretty big diary so I skipped through the pages until I found something interesting, after a while I finally found something interesting. Ivan was wanting to go camping with his friends the day after that record was written on 02/01/2023 2 days so he went camping yesterday it makes sense because I only saw the diary today, well I flipped through two more pages and found the entry for 03/01/2023 I will finally find the answers. their friends left the house in the afternoon they took a taxi and arrived at the campsite, it was normal until the night arrived and Ivan started to hear strange noises coming from the forest but he ignored them if\n\nthey had so much fun until it was time for bed then Ivan stopped writing I turned the page and more writing from Ivan but it was different his handwriting got worse like he was writing fast he said he woke up in the middle of the night to the noises of screaming it was his friends appeared 3 people with masks full of thorns and holding big axes they all ran and separated through the forest Ivar wrote this while he was hiding behind one of the trees covered in blood and counting his last records. He was trying to get out of that forest but he was just going deeper into it, he found a door in the ground hidden by leaves a kind of hiding place he went in and there were his friends being devoured by something and the murderers were there one of the murderers threw an ax in your\n\narm but he managed to escape his hiding place he ran a lot and saw the end of the forest but he had already lost a lot of blood he lay on the ground he wrote all this his last words were \"If you found this diary don't call the police or something like that they they are possessed they are more than murderers there is something in that place it may look like i'm crazy but no i saw it and something grotesque i don't want other people to get hurt i'll hide this diary here and if you found it tell other people so they never go there forest\"Well I don't know what I'm going to do maybe if I say this to someone no one will believe so I'm posting here give me suggestions on what to do do I call the police or do nothing?",

I'll see you there.\" He gave me a quick hug before running off. I watched him go, feeling a little better knowing that he would be there to help me out if anything went wrong.\n\nThe rest of the day went fast. After the school I nervously walked into the school parking lot, my heart pounding in my chest. I knew what I had to do, but I was scared. I had to face my bully.\n\nI can feel my heart pounding in my chest as I approach the spot where I know the bully will be waiting. I can already feel the anger and fear bubbling up inside me. My palms are sweaty and my stomach is in knots as I get closer. \n\nI finally reach the spot where the bully is waiting. I spotted him across the lot, leaning against his car, looking smug and confident. He looks me up and down with a sneer on his face. I try to stay calm. I remind myself that I'm not alone in this fight, and that I have people who care about me and are willing to help me if things get out of hand. The bully starts to say something, but before he can finish, i pull down my pant and start sh\\*ting inside my shoe.\n\nPart 2 coming soon",

        "text": "Throwaway account because my friends do not need to know about this. \n\nWe're talking a modern office chair from IKEA. Not some sofa I purchased from an antique store with bloody scratches along the back - no, this thing is bright blue with wheels for fuck's sake. In the light of day it couldn't be more unremarkable, to the point that I'm sitting on it as I type this. That's part of the problem. \n\nI guess I should give you some background, mundane as it is. One fine summer's morning I drove down to my nearest IKEA, tried out a couple of chairs, picked one, and dragged the box home to attempt putting it together. Now, I'll admit that if it was at some point in this process that the chair became demented, it was probably during that ordeal. I lost a wheel, put the back on the wrong way around, and fucked up an arm so badly it hasn't stopped wobbling even three years later (that's an arm on the chair, not mine). But hey, it ended up functional eventually, albeit with a wooden block in place of one of the wheels.\n\nIt served it's purpose admirably in that I forgot about it completely for the reminder of the day. Come 6:00 PM, I tucked it snugly into the desk and left to go get dinner with a few friends. Well past midnight I stumbled back into my room thoroughly drunk and conked out on my bed. So far so good.\n\nAt some point in the night, my bladder woke me up, as it will do when you've ingested about a gallon of liquor. The moment I was conscious enough to register my surroundings, a feeling of absolute dread took over. Like, you know those stories of people who wake up inexplicably in the middle of the night to discover the gas was left on, or that someone's broken in? That was what it felt like: a primal, lizard brain-y certainty that something was very wrong. \n\nI sniffed for a gas leak, or smoke. Nothing. I held my breath until I was woozy for air, listening for signs of someone else in my apartment. Nothing. I must have sat there for 10 minutes straight, trying to sus out the source of my mounting anxiety - and that's saying something considering I felt like an overfilled water balloon with a hangover. Eventually, I had to get up and tiptoe - yes, fucking tiptoe - to my bathroom, after which I sprinted back to my bedroom and attempted to jump under the blankets immediately. I say attempted because as I stood there in the doorway, with a view of the whole room, I knew precisely what was wrong with it. \n\nThe chair. It hadn't moved or anything. It was still sitting inoffensively right where I'd left it, but the idea that it was meant to be somewhere else hit me with a certainty that I could neither reason with nor ignore. I didn't quite know how it was meant to be though, so I went over and started turning it experimentally left and right. I didn't even realize it was facing the mirror when I - no, it - was finally satisfied. The feeling of relief, just as intense as the anxiety from before, was enough to send me shuffling to bed without another thought. \n\nThat's how things were for the next three years. Every night I'd brush my teeth, take a shower, and turn the chair toward the mirror before going to bed. Now, I assume at this point people will assume I'm either very dense or blowing the events of that night way out of proportion. Here's your explanation: I have OCD. \n\nIs it logical to feel compelled to turn your chair in a specific direction every night? No. But it's no less ridiculous than needing to click your pen fifteen times before you use it, or tap your refrigerator door fifty times after dinner, or tap your hands together five times whenever you hear a specific word, or- look, you get the picture. It was just one more thing to add to an ever-growing daily itinerary. I won't lie, some of my compulsions have felt something like the panic I've described, at the time I even went over my daily routine in my head to make sure I hadn't missed any. But at no point have I ever felt that I was in immediate mortal danger. \n\nFor a while, I assumed my OCD had just gotten worse. I've had 'flare-ups' at different points in my life, I resigned myself to riding out another one. Had the status quo remained, I wouldn't be posting this now. The latest development in the chair-saga is unusual enough that I can't explain it away as a symptom of my rocky mental health status.  \n\nI've begun to miss the thing. Not the sort of nostalgia you usually have for home when you've been away. I've found myself cutting trips short, leaving my part-time job early, pleading off dinner dates, all to come back and sit in my chair. It was subtle at first, I thought I was just tired and wanted a cup of tea. I had something I needed to finish. I had...an overwhelming desire to sit in my beloved chair and stare out into space for an indefinite period of time. On the nights that I do stay out late, I feel like a neglectful girlfriend, and have to fight the urge to shuffle into bed, avoiding eye contact (eye contact! ) with the disapproving bit of furniture. \n\nI hope I don't need to state that this is not what my OCD feels like, or has ever felt like. At no point have I tried to establish a friendship with my fridge, for example. It's an entirely alien sensation, and one that keeps intensifying every day. Already, I think I've become incapable to taking the chair back. I know if I ever did get rid of it, I'd feel like I'd tossed a cherished family pet into the woodchipper. No- no, I'd go back for it. I'm sure of that. I can't let it go. \n\nBefore anyone asks - no, it is not sexual. I don't want to do anything with the chair other than sit in it. Or maybe no one was going to ask that. I  did think of it though, and a few horrified hours of Googling later, knew enough to rule out the possibility. I also now know a lot more about objectophillia than I have ever wanted to. \n\nDoes someone have any clue what I should do now? Please don't suggest that I get rid of the chair, I truly can't. No, I haven't tried, I feel too guilty just considering it. I'm begining to worry that this unwillingess to leave it behind will either end in me never leaving my apartment, or in bringing it out with me wherever I go. Both situations I would like to avoid.",

        "text": "I was returning from school using the same path I always use but I saw something different, I always pass near a forest on the way, when I was passing I saw a book hidden under some tree leaves as if someone was trying to hide it I removed the leaves and took the book, It was a diary and it was covered in blood! I took the diary home when I arrived I went straight to my room and opened the diary and started to read. At first it looked like a normal diary, it was a 16-year-old boy named Ivan, he has 4 friends and is very popular at school, but that doesn't matter, what matters is knowing why the diary is covered in blood and hidden in a forest. I was trying to find more information but I was interrupted by my mother calling me to see a news on TV, 4 young people missing after camping in the woods and the names were Ivan Jenny Sam and Lenny exactly the names that were in the diary. I ran to my back room and went back to Reading the diary it was a pretty big diary so I skipped through the pages until I found something interesting, after a while I finally found something interesting. Ivan was wanting to go camping with his friends the day after that record was written on 02/01/2023 2 days so he went camping yesterday it makes sense because I only saw the diary today, well I flipped through two more pages and found the entry for 03/01/2023 I will finally find the answers. their friends left the house in the afternoon they took a taxi and arrived at the campsite, it was normal until the night arrived and Ivan started to hear strange noises coming from the forest but he ignored them if they had so much fun until it was time for bed then Ivan stopped writing I turned the page and more writing from Ivan but it was different his handwriting got worse like he was writing fast he said he woke up in the middle of the night to the noises of screaming it was his friends appeared 3 people with masks full of thorns and holding big axes they all ran and separated through the forest Ivar wrote this while he was hiding behind one of the trees covered in blood and counting his last records. He was trying to get out of that forest but he was just going deeper into it, he found a door in the ground hidden by leaves a kind of hiding place he went in and there were his friends being devoured by something and the murderers were there one of the murderers threw an ax in your arm but he managed to escape his hiding place he ran a lot and saw the end of the forest but he had already lost a lot of blood he lay on the ground he wrote all this his last words were \"If you found this diary don't call the police or something like that they they are possessed they are more than murderers there is something in that place it may look like i'm crazy but no i saw it and something grotesque i don't want other people to get hurt i'll hide this diary here and if you found it tell other people so they never go there forest\"Well I don't know what I'm going to do maybe if I say this to someone no one will believe so I'm posting here give me suggestions on what to do do I call the police or do nothing?",

        "text": "I requested to join a company research trip to the Arctic, all the way from civilization to here, a small little outpost in the middle of nowhere. I was getting sick of my usual research job in the office, and so I went to meditate and try to find my true calling in life.\n\nThe Arctic outpost was a job nobody wanted, really. From what I had heard, it was mainly used as a threat to get scientists to work faster, harder. Nobody wants to study ice.\n\nHell, studying ice wasn’t even what I’d learnt in college. I didn’t know a single thing about core samples, microbes frozen in the ice for millenia or whatever. But since they did technically have a position to fill, and I was the only person to volunteer, I was sent here.\n\nI thought I’d be alone to finally relax for a few months with my only company being polar bears, but APPARENTLY, the last two people went insane cooped up in the Arctic, so they finally decided on sending three other people.\n\nThere was this Canadian guy called Josh.\n\n“Nice to meet you, my name’s Josh and welcome to the Arctic,” he said the moment I stepped into the outpost. “Enjoy your stay here, it’s a nice little place.”\n\nHe was nice but maybe a bit too nice.\n\nAnd then there was Anya, who had a distinct Russian accent and seemed to never say anything. On the occasion she did, it was succinct, tart, and piercing. Quiet, and to the point. Perhaps my favourite colleague on the outpost.\n\nLast but not least was Maximilian, a big Swedish guy with a fluffy beard. He never seemed to be in a good mood at all. Apparently, he had messed up something so important elsewhere he’d been stationed in the Arctic as punishment. The rest of us tried to keep our distance from him to avoid him breaking our bones.\n\nYou can’t go wrong studying ice, apparently. Not that any of us actually knew what we were doing, save for Anya- who was the only one doing work.\n\nBut apart from that it was a dream job. I spent most of my days in my room doing absolutely nothing of value. And playing my all-time favourite game, Google Docs. And it was great.\n\nAll until the night the power went out.\n\n“Who the hell turned the lights out?!” came Maximilian’s infuriated voice from the makeshift bathroom. He sounded like he was on the verge of slamming one of us into the ice\n\nWe were idly playing cards in what was supposed to be the laboratory.\n\n“Power just went off by itself!” Anya shouted back.  \n “Let’s draw cards to see who goes out to fix it,” I suggested, selecting a king, a queen, an ace, and a joker. The others agreed, and we waited for Maximilian to come out of the bathroom. When we were all set, I set the cards all face down on the table. “Whoever picks the ace has to fix the power?”\n\n“Sure,” Anya agreed. “And we better fix it fast- before we all freeze to death.”\n\n“Let’s draw,” said Josh. We all looked at Josh, and he pulled the first card- the queen.\n\n“Me next,” I decided, drawing from the deck. I got the king. \n\n“Two more,” Anya murmured, going next. She paused, and then drew the card. “Ace.” Anya got up to leave, to go get her parka and head into the icy cold world.\n\n“Fix it fast, will you?” Maximilian demanded, already shivering.\n\nWe all put on our parkas. I checked my old watch. It was 11 p.m. We waited for the power to come back on, now only a few torches lighting up the darkness.\n\nWe waited and waited. But the power never came back on. We had been waiting about a quarter of an hour now, and we were all getting impatient with how long it was taking. The power had been having issues since day one, but it always took a simple switch or push to get it back running.\n\nMaximilian got impatient and finally picked up his radio. “Anya? How’s fixing the damn thing going? It’s freezing here.”\n\nNo response. He tried again. A whole minute of silence passed before we got something. It was a subtle change to the static, like Anya was trying to communicate with us, yet her words seemed like gibberish. Or maybe it was Russian?\n\n“Anya?” Josh asked, concerned. “You need help out there?”\n\n“Help,” Anya, on the radio murmured, still sounding far away. “Out there.”\n\nWe could barely hear it. “You need help?” Josh asked. “Is something wrong with the machine?”\n\n“Help,” Anya repeated, the static almost obscuring her voice entirely. “Wrong with machine…”\n\nShe was Russian, but she still spoke coherently, like any old English speaker, although with a slight accent. She should have said ‘something wrong with the machine’, or clarified, and something about that didn’t sit right with me.\n\n“Can you say that again?” Josh asked in concern. “We can’t quite hear you- and what’s wrong with the machine.”\n\nStatic. Then her voice. “Need help. Something wrong with machine.”\n\n“Ugh, I’ll go and deal with this crap,” Maximilian loudly declared.\n\n“No,” Josh cut in. With the way Maximilian had been acting since we’d all got here, we’d both silently wondered if today would be the moment he’d snap. “I’ll go.”\n\n“Get it done quickly,” Maximilian fumed, his fists balling up and sweat trickling down his forehead. \n\nHe left quickly, and he’d forgotten his radio. “Josh, wait!” I called. He was already out by then. \n\nAs soon as the door shut, Maximilian slammed his fist into the table, sending vibrations that caused the cards to fly into the air.\n\n“Calm down!” I told. “It’s not a big deal.”\n\n“Well it is-” and then he stopped as the lights flickered back on, and the temperature started to rise. His anger shrinked back, and he calmed down, relaxing in his seat. “Never mind.”\n\nWe heard a knock on the door, and I went out and peered at the peephole to see who it was.\n\nBut there was nobody there. Probably an animal who’d scampered away.\n\nI started to go back to my seat when another knock appeared on the door, and this time, I heard a voice. “Josh? Maximilian? Carol? I’m back- could you let me in- there’s something out here.” Anya paused. “I think it might be a polar bear.”\n\nI raced back to the door, looked out to see Anya and opened it. She hurried inside, and we closed the door. It activated its automatic lock- the metal thing was broken, and our key cards- which should have been able to open it from outside, didn’t work, and now it required one person to be inside at all times.\n\nBut it wasn’t like we were ever outside, so we didn’t complain about it.\n\n“Anya,“ I began, confused. “Where’s Josh?”\n\n“Wasn’t he inside with you?” she replied, raising an eyebrow.\n\n“No, you called him to come and help you.”\n\n“I didn’t? One of the levers broke and I had to walk all the way to the maintenance shed to get a replacement- that’s why it took so long. But I didn’t have any problem with it.” \n\n“But we heard you ask for help on the radio?” I inquired. Something wasn’t right here. “And did you see anything knock on the door before you came?”\n\n“No, but that reminds me,” Anya continued, shaking her head. “When I was out there, I felt like something was watching me. I tried to look for it, but whatever it was, it would always duck out of view. I’d just see a flash of something running.”\n\n“An animal, probably?” Maximilian theorised, overhearing the conversation as we entered the lab-turned game room.\n\n“It was too big to be either of those,” Anya pointed out. “But too small to be a bear. It was almost… human sized?”\n\n“Maybe it was Josh?”\n\n“But why would he do that? And you said you never asked for help- so- who did?” I pondered.\n\nBefore any of us could say anything, the radio crackled to life, and we heard Josh’s voice on the radio. “Need. Help. Something. Wrong. Machine.” His voice was far away, and the way he stopped to pause before saying the next word made me feel a touch uneasy.\n\n“Josh?” I began. “The machine’s fixed. Are you okay out there? Anya’s back- I just let her through the door, and-”\n\n**WHAM!** There was a knock on the door. And then we heard a scraping noise, like metal rubbing against metal. The radio started up again. “Machine. Okay.”\n\n**WHAM!** “Door. Through. Machine. Bear. Help.” Josh continued. I was starting to wonder if it was really Josh out there, and I edged to the door. “Something okay. Door.” I peered out and saw Josh outside. Except he was only wearing his thermals.\n\n“Josh?” I stammered. “Are you not cold? Do you want to come in?”\n\nJosh’s voice appeared again on the radio. “Through door. Josh okay. Want come in.”\n\n“Wait,” something important suddenly came to my mind. Josh hadn’t brought his radio with him, and I still saw it back on the lab table, “Josh didn’t take his radio-”\n\n“So how the hell is he talking to us?!” Maximilian retorted. \n\n“Cold,” Josh echoed. “Josh cold. Through door.” His words on the radio were starting to sound closer now. It was more fluent. It was like a young child learning how to speak true sentences.\n\nAnya began to edge towards the door handle, unsure if the door should be opened, or not. A moment later she withdrew. \n\n“Is that really you, Josh?” Anya asked. “What’s your full name?”\n\n“Josh. Is really Josh.”\n\n“I don’t think that’s Josh,” murmured Maximilian. The burly man edged closer, and shouted. “Go away!”\n\n“Josh. Away.” and then we heard a final slam on the door, and something heavy walking away. I looked through the peephole and saw nothing but cold ice. \n\nWe collectively sighed and retreated to the game room. \n\n“What the hell was that thing?” Maximilian growled. “Some sort of impostor?”\n\n“I don’t know, but my mother worked as a Soviet scientist,” Anya began. “She told me stories of this creature, brought back from the permafrost. She called it Самозванец- I believe it means impostor. My Russian isn’t that good.”\n\n“An impostor?”\n\n“I never thought her stories were true, but now…” Anya solemnly murmured.\n\nMaximilian excused himself and said he had to go to the toilet. With nothing to do we resumed our card game, until at last we started talking about why we came here.\n\n“When I told my mother I was heading to the Arctic, she warned me,” Anya murmured. “I wanted to take the job because there was too much drama at home. My husband had recently gone MIA- he was a soldier, and my sister had been caught having an affair with her boss.”\n\n“That sucks,” I noted. “I’m just here to meditate. Find my true calling, write my book, read everything I’ve ever wanted. That stuff. I wonder why Maximilian’s here, though. I just heard terrible stories.”\n\n“Those stories are probably true.”\n\nAnd that’s when we heard it. A soft, fleshy squelching coming from all around us. And the distinct sound of radio static, even though none of our radios lit up. \n\n“What the hell-”\n\n**WHAM!** But this time, the sound didn’t come from the front door. It came from inside the bathroom- and then a guttural, primordial scream. There was a scuffling noise, and a second **WHAM**, and then there was silence.\n\nThe bathroom door handle was turning now, and it wiggled this way and that.\n\n“Maximilian?” I wondered. “Are you-”\n\nThe door opened softly, creaking, ajar. There was a figure behind it, illuminated by the bathroom lights. It looked like Maximilian- but there was something else, something fleshy and bloody behind him.\n\nIt almost looked like… Josh.\n\nOur radios crackled to life. “Maximilian. Okay.” It was Maxmillian’s voice, now, and it sounded like it was coming from both the bathroom and the radio at the same time.\n\nMaximilian- or whatever had replaced him stood silently in the bathroom, not moving a muscle. \n\n“I don’t think that’s Maximilian,” I murmured.\n\n“Is,” the thing that was not Maximilian replied, “Maximilian.”\n\nThe door opened slightly more. I gasped. Josh’s body was on the floor, beside Maximilian, half inside the toilet. It seemed empty of flesh, as if it was just a skinsuit for something that had lived inside.\n\n“Jam the door!” I shrieked.\n\n“With what?” Anya replied, backing away. I noted how both Josh and Maximilian’s eyes seemed to follow her. She pushed the table over. “Maybe this.”\n\n“Door,” Maximilian’s voice monotoned. “Really.”\n\nWe grabbed hold of the table and pushed it forward, slowly, pushing the door back into its closed state, all while the thing that had replaced Maximilian continued to remain still, and smile.\n\n“Okay, I think we’re safe now,” Anya sighed.\n\n“Head to the safe room!” I decided, gesturing at a room across the hall. It was there in case a polar bear got in, and we’d had to use it once or twice before.\n\n“Right-”\n\n**WHAM!** We turned to see a dent on the door. And then this inky black substance that almost seemed like blood leak out it. The substance seemed to digest the hinges, and suddenly, the door fell onto the table, its large metal crushing it entirely.\n\nThe imposter began to walk, jankily, as if it had just learned how. There was a mesmerising quality to how it dragged itself closer to us.\n\n“Run!” Anya yelled, and then we were off, running to the safe room that seemed almost an eternity away. We heard loud, heavy footsteps, as if it were some sort of giant chasing us.\n\nBut it was only Maximilian, or the thing that had replaced him. And it was gaining speed, somehow- for every time I looked back it was getting closer.\n\nAnd then we were at the safe room, trying to get in. “What’s the code?!” I screamed.\n\n“I- I don’t remember- it might be-” she thought quickly as Maximilian advanced. “F302?!”\n\nI typed it in and the mechanical door groaned, slowly opening as Maximilian appeared just behind us. As soon as there was room I entered, and then Anya-\n\n“Help!” Anya screamed, halfway through as an arm far too long shot out and grabbed her. “It’s got me!”\n\nI grabbed hold of Anya, but the thing was too strong. The door was fully open now, but now it was going to close again- a safety mechanism so that the safe room remained ‘safe’.\n\nThe door slowly closed.\n\nI tried to pull Anya closer- but all that did was pull Maximilian closer as well. And that would mean I’d be stuck inside the safe room with him too. He was too strong and yanked Anya away.\n\nI took the moment and slammed the door. There was a scream, and then silence.\n\nThere was static on the safe room’s radio. “Anya. Help. Door. Open.” It was Anya’s voice, but I knew it wasn’t her.\n\n“What the hell are you?!” I snapped.\n\n“Hell. You.” **WHAM!** And then I heard heavy footsteps walking away. \n\nAnd then I heard all the radios turn on, now being tuned to public frequencies. I heard the chatter of news outlets, advertisements, and music on the radio. What the hell was going on- was the monster doing this.\n\n“Breaking news,” the radio chattered. “Fire downtown sighted- emergency services on the way.”\n\nAnd then I heard Maximilian, Anya, and Josh’s voices, all at once, repeat the words on the radio.\n\n“Breaking news. Fir downtown sighted.”\n\nAnd then I realised what it was doing.\n\n“My god,” I murmured. “It’s learning.”\n\n“Learning,” I heard it smile on the radio. “Correct.” And that was a word I swear it hadn’t ever heard before.\n\nI realised then I could call for help. The safe room had a long range radio that could allow me to contact company headquarters. But I wondered if I really should. It was learning now, and it getting smarter.\n\nIf anyone came to the base it could manipulate them into bringing it back to the outside world. And if it was getting smarter- there was no telling what chaos it could. And we had no idea where it had come from.\n\nHad the melting of the ice caps freed it? Or had it always been in the Arctic, replacing, hunting, learning?\n\nI began to type a message to send back to headquarters- this very message you’re reading right now. If anyone reads this- don’t come this outpost. It has to remain stranded. \n\nAnd that thing is definitely going to learn how to communicate with you. It’s going to want to leave. This is a warning. Nuke the outpost or something.\n\nWait. Something’s wrong. The chatter of the radio had stopped. “Hello?” \n\nI heard a squishing, fleshy noise from above me, from the vents that that supplied air to the room. I heard an echo. “Hello?” It’s here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSend help. Machine broken. No Самозванец. Josh okay. Maximilian okay. Anya okay. Carol okay. Send help. Machine broken…",

        "text": "I usually go on long runs in the forest, mainly to be in tune with nature and to exercise. I've seen lots of wild animals, abandoned cabins, staircases and everything in between on my runs. But until a couple years ago, I found this piano in the deep in the forest. No head trail to it or drag marks or anything. It seemed like it appeared from nowhere. And this was super deep in the forest too. My reaction was that it looked beautiful, and it was almost in perfect condition. I couldn't find any company name on it so probably it was handmade. I really wanted to know the backstory to this piano and how it ended up here. It was just standing there under a birch tree like it recently spawned. But it’s made of wood, so it’s back with it's friends now. I tried playing it and funny enough it was in perfect tune. I went back to it a couple of times. A couple of times turned into a dozen times. It sounded so beautiful in the forest. The forest bring such cool acoustics to it. I never really reacted to the fact that it still was in good condition. Either someone is actively servicing it or it's a really good built piano. But one day I could swear I heard someone playing it too. When I arrived at the spot no one was there. If a piano is in a forest and no one plays it, does it make a sound? I felt the feeling like somebody was watching me. After that time, I actually never went back to it. But it was until very recently that I've heard some stories about more people finding abandoned pianos deep in the forest. All over the world. And they found them really deep deep in the woods. I looked it up on the web and found a couple theories. If you play the right notes it will open another dimension or if you play it you will get cursed for life. The piano did look a bit cursed but at the same time beautiful. But I found this strangely disturbing old Swedish myth that if you ever find a piano in the woods, do not play it. If you play it, you will come back to it, again and again. You'll basically become obsessed. And the funny thing is, I've already played it like a couple dozen times so I guess I'm obsessed. What's weirding me out is that this piano only *looks* abandoned. I really felt like somebody was there with me at some times. These pianos should go out of tune really quickly when put in this environment. And who even copes to drag a piano so deep, they're super heavy? They are surprisingly difficult to get rid of. No one wants them and they’re rather unwieldy to move. And who even was that person I heard playing it? I have so many questions that needs answers. And that's all I have about this piano. Have you on guys on /nosleep seen or heard anything about the pianos in the woods? Let me know.",

        "text": "I didn't tell Dr. Sutherland about the lady with bleeding eyeballs. About how she'd been lingering in the stairwell whenever I got up to pee at night.\n\nAnd really, can you blame me? There was no way to broach the subject without confirming his worst suspicions. ‘*Oh it’s rough, doc. I’ve got a catalogue of symptoms longer than your grocery list: memory loss, dry mouth, mood swings. And there was one more thing, what was it again? Oh yeah, sometimes I see the outline of a figure creeping around the upstairs landing, so rather than relieve my bladder I barricade the bedroom door with a dresser*. *Crazy, huh?*’\n\nIf I'd said that, his fancy fountain pen would have no doubt gone whizzing across the little notepad. Or maybe he’d have saved himself the trouble by busting out the big rubber stamp labelled: DERANGED.\n\nFrom the dark circles under my eyes, he could no doubt tell things weren't *stellar* back home. Still, I forced myself to smile while I fielded a series of loaded questions about my ‘fragile’ mental condition.\n\nAt the end of our session, the doc leaned forward in his armchair—close enough that I could count the bristly nose hairs—and said, “We all just want what’s best for everyone, Robyn.”\n\n\"Of course,\" I replied, my fingers sinking into the padded armrests.\n\n\\-\n\nI picked Kyle up from school. Back home, Molly was scrolling through her phone. After thirty minutes of ‘gentle’ coercion they both tackled their homework while I whipped together a beef stew.\n\nWe ate together in silence. Afterwards, Molly went out with some friends I’d never met before. I told her to get back by eleven, but at sixteen who listens to their mother? Kyle changed into his pyjamas and then we read the latest Dogman book in his room. I cherished moments like those. In three short years, puberty would rear its ugly head, then lying next to his mommy would only embarrass him.\n\nTo cap the night off, I tortured myself by flicking through some old photo albums.\n\n\\-\n\nThe wind howled around the roof, startling me awake. At the end of the hall, bony fingers scraped roughly across bookcases and over floorboards. I folded a pillow over my skull to drown these sounds out, but horrible images of twisted metal and blood-splattered glass kept me up until dawn.\n\nStill groggy, I shuffled into the lounge. A single nerf bullet lay on the windowsill. Those stupid darts kept appearing even though I’d confiscated Kyle’s blaster weeks earlier.\n\nI crossed the room and pulled the curtain back. Down below, past the ivy wall, Mr. Rutherford trimmed the chest-high hedge separating our gardens. The elderly man glanced up and gave a friendly salute. He got a half-hearted wave in response.\n\nFor both Mr. Rutherford and his wife, retirement had really meant ‘ample opportunities to stick their noses in other people's business’. I flirted with asking whether they'd spotted a figure stalking around my house last night…\n\n\\-\n\nAt our next appointment, Dr. Sutherland asked about Chloe. Ten minutes and an entire box of Kleenex later, I eased into a story about my ninth birthday, when this freckly kid at the playpark demanded a kiss. I said no because his breath reeked worse than raw sewage, so he snatched the Tamagotchi clipped onto my belt and smashed it with a rock.\n\nI ran home crying to tell Chloe, who marched me back there and pinned the bully kid down beside the swing set. Since the little shit refused to apologize, she wrestled the light-up trainers off his feet, laced them together, and tossed them up around a lamppost.\n\n“She sounds like a wonderful sister,” the doc said, offering me a fresh box of tissues.\n\n\\-\n\nIn the kitchen, the sight of a recycling bin stuffed with wine bottles almost triggered a panic attack. They didn’t vanish with a rub of my eyes, so I searched the entire house and discovered a pill packet beneath the clock on the bookshelf.\n\nDid I blackout again? If the neighbours caught me half-cut, that information might have reached the good doctor. Or worse, my beloved husband…\n\nThe bottles got dumped at the recycling centre on my way to collect Kyle.\n\n\\-\n\nOver breakfast, Molly announced her plans to see Wolf Alice play in London. \"I'll be back Sunday,\" she said, like this was no big deal.\n\nMolly, like her dear aunt, had straight blonde hair and green eyes. Kyle and I were all curly brown locks and full cheeks.\n\nI sighed. “Who are you going with? Where are you staying? And when did you plan on telling me?”\n\n“James and Emma. James’s brother’s flat. Andddd...right now.”\n\nRubbing both temples to supress a thumper of a headache, I took a deep breath, held it, and tried expelling all that toxic air.\n\nCue an argument so played out you’d think we read it from a script.\n\nHer: you’re the worst, all these dumb rules.\n\nMe: I don’t know these people. It’s too dangerous.\n\nIn my mind I heard *my* mother’s voice, loud and angry. The debate ended with Molly storming off into her room.\n\n\\-\n\nNext time Dr. Sutherland asked about Chloe, I fought back the emotion long enough to get out a story about the two of us learning the dance routine for ‘Wannabe’ by the Spice Girls in our parent's living room.\n\nWhen that second chorus hits, you lean your top half forward and kick your left leg back, and I did this so hard and so fast I accidentally punted Mom’s porcelain cat—the one forever batting an invisible string out of the air.\n\nChloe picked it up, revealing the face had cracked right along the middle. My blood pressure shot into the stratosphere and refused to climb back down until Baby Spice (aka Chloe) hugged me into her chest and ran her fingers through my hair. That simple gesture always calmed my nerves.\n\nOnce I stopped sobbing, she promised she'd tell our parents it was her fault, not mine.\n\nWhen Dad's Ford pulled into the driveway, I hid in the bedroom with a pillow folded over my skull so I couldn’t hear the raised voices. My sister’s bravery earned her a collection of ugly purple bruises.\n\nPart of me wanted to tell Dr. Sutherland about the foam darts, although he’d clearly labelled me a basket case the instant my file landed on his desk. No sense handing him the smoking gun, right?\n\nWith all the grace of a constipated hippo, he steered the conversation toward my husband.\n\nI explained how my marriage felt like the eggshell walking Olympics. Early in our relationship, I once casually mentioned I didn’t much like driving, and by the time Kyle was potty trained, if I so much as said I needed to nip to the store, Brian snapped back with, “No you *hate* driving. I’ll take you.”\n\nOf course, Dr. Sutherland believed my ex to be a real stand-up guy; a proper bloke’s bloke who loved a good laugh, know what I mean? Hell of a golfer, too—the pair frequently bumped into each other at the driving range.\n\nFunny that…\n\nI leaned forward in the armchair, made my voice all serious, and said, “The day Brian and I split up I barricaded myself in the bathroom because I couldn't take any more screaming. And do you know what that bastard did? He used a credit card undo the lock and yell in my face some more.\"\n\n“Mmhmm, mmhmm. And are you still drinking?”\n\nDeflated, I shrunk back into my chair. “No.”\n\n\\-\n\nEvery other weekend, Brian whisked the kids away for some quality time. Our divorce had become a real shitshow: he’d demanded full custody due to my ‘alarming’ behaviour, but the judge dismissed this request because he had a nasty habit of pummeling drivers who sniped his parking spot or cut him off at an intersection.\n\nIf you talked with our friends and family, they all had *some* notion about his temper, although they mostly waved these outbursts aside with statements such as, ‘have you seen the way people drive in this town?’\n\nWith the kids gone, I turned every room upside down searching for more meds. Weeks earlier, during a mandatory inspection, a social worker *almost* found enough Cipralex to dope an elephant beneath my mattress. By pure chance, my eye happened across the foil wrapper at the very last second and I quickly stuffed it up my sleeve, narrowly avoiding getting sectioned on-the-spot.\n\nAlone in the empty house, the grief came in waves. My mind cycled through hideous images of a cracked windshield, flashing ambulance lights reflected in the spiderweb of glass.\n\nAt midnight, feeling brave enough to use the bathroom, I climbed out of bed and stepped into the hall. Up ahead, the lounge door creaked open. I hesitated. The cold, stale air of the house plummeted ten degrees as that door eased inward, revealing a thick darkness. From inside the room a pair of bulging eyes regarded me, wet and shiny with blood.\n\nI bolted back into my room, pushed a dresser against the door, and climbed beneath the sheets like a petrified child. Already on the verge of losing my sanity, I used a pillow to drown out the sound of uneasy steps staggering around the house. Now and again, the figure’s presence radiated through the door, which almost seemed worse than actually seeing it.\n\nSix sleepless hours later, I ventured into the lounge.\n\nCrimson pools of blood covered the lounge floorboards like little inkblots, surrounding a single nerf dart. I scrubbed the floor with scalding water until my fingers turned raw.\n\nThe dart, like all the others, got tossed in the bin. Not that this ever did any good. More would appear, and I knew why.\n\nIt was a punishment. A way of reminding me the accident was all my fault.\n\n\\-\n\nI told Dr. Sutherland Chloe was your hall of fame ‘cool Aunt’, and how that coolness rubbed off on me by symbiosis.\n\nTake our nerf war, for instance. It started when I returned home to an empty house one evening. Chloe, the babysitter, wasn’t answering her phone, and after several minutes of screeching the kids’ names, I heard whispers from the bathroom.\n\nAlready on hold with the police, I raced toward the shower and ripped the curtain aside.\n\nAs a hail of nerf bullets pelted me in the face, I screamed so loud those old fogies next door complained their ears didn't stop ringing for an entire week.\n\nBefore me, on either side of Chloe, the kids doubled over with laughter, proud of their little 'prank'. And, four days later (after I finally stopped shaking) I had to admit they got me pretty good.\n\nThe ensuing conflict became known as ‘the nerf war’. My sister and I surprised each other at home, the shops, pilates. Anywhere besides work. Molly and Kyle helped set-up sting operations, switched allegiances, and even acted as human shields on multiple occasions.\n\nMy absolute masterstroke came when Chloe took Kyle to the playpark one afternoon. After jumping off the climbing frame, he told his aunt a little girl had broken her arm inside the tube tunnel and needed help.\n\nConcerned, she flew up the steps, crawled through the pipe on her elbows and knees, and found herself face-to-face with...me.\n\n“You sneaky bitch,” she laughed, as a nerf bullet struck her right between the eyes.\n\nA tiny portion of that pent-up anxiety seeped out of me telling the story.\n\n\\-\n\nBrian dropped the kids off on Sunday night.\n\n“How’d you get on?” I asked Molly as she marched into the kitchen.\n\n“Fine,” she mumbled, making a cup of tea only for herself, not me. Before the accident, we’d taken turns and drunk them together while watching Love Island or Bake Off. My blackouts ended that little ritual.\n\nAfter Kyle showered and changed into his pyjamas, we re-read an old edition of Captain Underpants, and then I went and rapped Molly’s door. From the edge of her bed, I told her I didn’t like how far apart we’d grown.\n\n“Whose fault is that?” she snapped, rolling away from me.\n\n“I know what I put you through wasn't fair, but I’m much better now,” I said, my voice breaking apart.\n\n“Dad thinks you’re drinking again. Says the neighbours do to.”\n\nWhat could I have said? ‘*Oh, your fathers not the superhero you think he is. Throughout our relationship, if the master manipulator was happy, he allowed me to be happy. But the second he stopped being happy…’*\n\nUnfortunately, telling my daughter this meant also convincing her she had a sociopath for a father. There was no level that man wouldn’t stoop to if it painted me in a bad light.\n\nI wallowed in bed, never dozing off for more than twenty minutes. Those bottles and pills weren’t mine. I think. It’s difficult to tell whenever one day blurs into the next. Plus, if I’d taken them—*if*—it might have caused another blackout. Maybe my doped-up self tiptoed around the house, strategically placing bullets as a form of self-torture?\n\nPerhaps the doc was right. Perhaps I had come untethered again…\n\n\\-\n\nAt our next session, Dr. Sutherland finally asked about the accident.\n\nI swallowed a lump and told him Chloe came over beforehand, that she wanted a girl’s night out but the mere suggestion made my stomach queasy.\n\n“I thought getting divorced meant you didn’t have to worry what that bastard thinks?” she said.\n\n“We’re not divorced. We’re *separated*.”\n\n“Same thing. Besides, isn’t he in Portugal golfing with his buddies?”\n\n“He’d find out,\" I answered grimly. \"I’ll bump into somebody who knows us.”\n\n“So glad that pricks gone,” she muttered. “You know who he reminded me of?”\n\n“Don’t even say it.”\n\nOn the sofa, we talked our way *around* my current predicament. She caught me up on her new job, the Vegas trip with her pals, and a bunch of other wonderful life events I’d missed out on because had Brian isolated me from friends and family.\n\nChloe, bless her heat, gave hoisting me out of that funk her best effort, but a permanent storm cloud had hung over me since the breakup.\n\nWe hugged goodbye at the door. Then, five minutes later, while I gathered our empty plates and cheeseboard in the upstairs lounge, my eye happened across a misshapen lump behind the curtain.\n\nBefore I could react, Chloe sprung from her hiding spot beside the window and launched a dart straight at my forehead. “Gotcha.”\n\nFor the first time in weeks I actually found myself laughing. And I knew right then I’d get through the separation, or divorce, or whatever lay in store. All I needed was a little support from my big sis.\n\nIt took a profound effort to tell Dr. Sutherland how, later that night, two police officers knocked on the door and revealed there’d been an accident. There was more blood in the pictures of the wreck than I thought a human body could possibly hold.\n\nAt the hospital, Chloe lay motionless in bed, her face encased with bandages stained red around the eyes.\n\nAfter twenty minutes of me picking glass shards from her blood-clotted hair and whispering how she had to hold on because her little sis needed her, a doctor stepped into the room, said we needed to have a very difficult conversation, and explained Chloe had less brain activity than a tin of soup. Keeping her hooked up to a respirator only prolonged the inevitable.\n\nThrough tears, I insisted he not pull the plug. Chloe was a warrior. The strongest person I ever knew. If it had been anyone else inside that cage of twisted metal, they would have died instantly. But not her. She’d held on for me. She was my protector. And I knew she’d always, always, always be there during the good times and the bad.\n\nUntil, suddenly, she wasn’t.\n\nI never looked at the body. That let my imagination run wild plugging the gaps. Images of a figure flayed of skin with glass shards jutting from a broken neck haunted my waking thoughts.\n\nAnd those eyes. Those hideous, bleeding eyes…\n\nDr. Sutherland’s pen scribbled away furiously. The sound whipped me back to the present, and I stopped myself from telling him how—in the weeks that followed Chloe’s death—life became a series of backouts intermixed with pills and alcohol. I couldn’t live with the guilt. If I hadn’t called her that night begging for a shoulder to cry on, she never would have been driving along that exact stretch of motorway whenever the damned eighteen-wheeler pulled out.\n\nThe weeks passed in a whirlwind of missed school runs and forgotten lunches. Normally, my big sis came to the rescue during times like those; what was I meant to do now she was gone?\n\nOne night, after I’d sobered up, Molly started World War three by sneaking out late. Immediately two police officers turned up in response to a ‘domestic disturbance’ and declared me in a ‘compromised’ condition.\n\nThen came the investigations, the mandatory wellness checks.\n\nThe court-mandated therapy…\n\nBrian worked overtime painting me as the worst mother on the planet: a carefully placed comment to a teacher here, a ‘chance’ meeting with Dr. Sutherland there.\n\nEnsuring all this remained hidden became a full-time job. I couldn’t let anybody discover Chloe punished me by creeping around dropping nerf bullets, otherwise they’d call it a coping mechanism, or an avoidance technique.\n\nOr a hysterical mother who couldn’t face reality…\n\nAs I told Dr. Sutherland the day Chloe died all joy seeped out of the world, I couldn’t help wonder whether the kids staying with me *wasn’t* best for everyone. Could I really do this without my big sister looking out for me?\n\n\\-\n\nThat sense of despair lingered for the rest of the day. I sleepwalked through dinner and tucking Kyle in.\n\nImages of the wreck haunted me as I lay motionless in bed. They brought along this sense of coming untethered. I couldn’t block them out. I needed—physically needed—my big sister. What I wouldn’t have given to have her fingers run through my hair one last time.\n\nJust then, out in the hall, floorboards creaked. Those creaks drew louder, closer.\n\nBe careful what you wish for...\n\nI slipped beneath the blanket, squeezed my eyes shut, and told myself those sounds were imaginary.\n\nOut of nowhere, I couldn’t breathe. The bedroom door creaked open while I lay paralysed. The figure crawled across the floor and up onto my bed, mattress springs groaning as the covers got pulled tight.\n\nThrough the protective barrier, a forehead pressed against mine. Before the accident, this was the part where I called Chloe; what did I do now she’d returned from the dead to haunt me?\n\nSuddenly, the sheet got ripped away. I sat bolt upright, alone in the empty room.\n\nBy the door, there sat a single nerf bullet. Not again. This couldn't carry on. Chloe died, and she wasn’t coming back--no matter how many bullets I stashed around the house.\n\nI pulled on a gown and scooped up the dart. Six more lay spread across the landing, a little trail. Clearly I’d taken more pills and punished myself by laying out scavenger hunt.\n\nFurious at myself, I crossed the hallway gathering them as I went. From beyond the door into the lounge there were more scrapes. Bumps, bangs. But I couldn’t hide forever. My kids needed me, which meant I needed to face my problems. Even if that meant facing them alone.\n\nThe door to the lounge opened at a push. And at the far side of the room, my eye happened across a familiar face reflected in the glass.\n\nIt was Chloe, except she looked unhurt. The way I *wished* I could remember her.\n\nA warm glow spread throughout my body. It was her. It was really, really her. The one who made the sadness melt away with a joke or well-timed hug. She'd come back.\n\nI raced across the room, shouted her name, told her just how much I missed her.\n\nAs I pushed open the window, it collided with a solid object, and then loud snap rang up from below. I leaned outside.\n\nBeneath me, a shadowy figure lay sprawled across the rose bushes, quietly groaning. I thought a burglar had been breaking in until I heard the intruder curse.\n\nI rushed downstairs—ordering the kids back to bed as they leaned out of their rooms—dashed around the side of the house, flicked the landing light on, and crossed the yard.\n\nKitted out all in black, my husband rolled around, his left shoulder misplaced from its socket.\n\n\"What the *fuck* do you think you’re doing here?” I shouted.\n\n“You stupid bitch,” he hissed through clenched teeth. “Why are you opening a window in the middle of the fucking night?”\n\nA discarded backpack lay nearby. Brian moved to swat my arm aside but instead clutched his shoulder and grimaced.\n\nInside the pack there were pills, empty wine bottles, and a bent-out-of-shape coat hanger. The bastard had been breaking in to frame me…\n\nThe layout of the house meant a fit enough person could climb the ivy fence. Clearly, Brian had been using a hanger to unhook the window latch and force his way inside.\n\n“You son of a bitch,” I screamed, spittle flying from my lips. “You’ve been making it look like I'm drinking again.”\n\nHe sprung up and threw himself at my chest, hard. We both landed in the wet dirt, him on top.\n\nA gloved hand closed tight around my windpipe. My window of vision died away while Brian screamed what a terrible mother I was and said he wished he’d killed me—that he was *going* to kill me.\n\nThe garden and everything in it faded to black. Next thing I knew, I was staring up at Mr. Rutherford, who was trying to wrestle Brian into a headlock.\n\nThe world slowly slid into view. On the far side of the hedge, a teary Mrs. Rutherford screamed into her phone begging the police to hurry. For once I found myself grateful we had the nosiest neighbours this side of the Channel Islands. If not for them, I never would have woken up…\n\nAttracted by the commotion, other residents emerged from their homes while, above us, Molly and Kyle leaned out of the lounge, their eyes wide with shock.\n\nMy husband shook Mr. Rutherford off and turned on that signature charm. He only rushed over because I drunk-dialled him, you see. Over the phone I'd announced my plans to kill the kids and then myself, he simply rushed over to protect his family.\n\nFrom the look on Molly’s face, I could tell she hadn't bought this little sob story.\n\nSeveral neighbours chased the bastard into his car, then he almost mowed down the gathering crowd speeding away. No doubt he’d later challenge my version of events, but the kids saw what happened. That was enough.\n\nAfter two officers took a report from both me and the Rutherfords, I put an upset Kyle to bed before turning in myself, my neck all tender and raw. A few minutes later Molly stepped through the door carrying two cups of tea.\n\n“I thought this might help your throat,” she said, holding up my favourite Spice Girls mug. “There’s honey in it.”\n\nShe stood there, her lower lip wobbling, until I swung the sheet aside and gestured for her to hop in. For a while we lay together in silence, her head against my chest, my fingers running through her golden hair. Then, she looked up at me and said, “I’m sorry about those things I said before.”\n\nI told her none of that mattered now. I wouldn’t have believed me either.\n\nSoon Kyle knocked the door and asked to come in, and then the three of us lay there all toasty and snug.\n\nAnd, for the first time since the accident, it felt like things might turn out alright. That my family would survive this awful mess, and nothing could ever, ever tear us apart.\n\nAfter all, we had my big sis[ looking out for us.](https://www.reddit.com/r/thoughtindustry/comments/te0fum/welcome_i_hope_you_enjoy_your_stay/)",

        "text": " \n\nIt was a dark and stormy night when I first saw the strange figure in the woods. I was driving home from a late shift at the hospital, my headlights barely piercing the darkness as I navigated the winding roads.\n\nSuddenly, a figure appeared out of nowhere, standing in the middle of the road. I slammed on the brakes, but it was too late. The car hit the figure with a sickening thud, and I heard a faint cry of pain.\n\nPanicked, I threw open the door and ran to the figure lying in the road. It was a woman, her face contorted in pain. She was barely conscious, but she managed to whisper one word before she lost consciousness: \"Help.\"\n\nI knew I had to get her to the hospital as quickly as possible. I lifted her into the car and sped off into the night, my heart racing as I navigated the treacherous roads.\n\nWhen we arrived at the hospital, I rushed the woman into the emergency room and called for help. The doctors and nurses rushed to her side, and I watched in horror as they worked to save her life.\n\nBut as the night wore on, it became clear that the woman was not going to survive. As she took her last breath, she reached out and grabbed my hand, her eyes fixed on mine.\n\n\"You have to find the others,\" she whispered. \"They're in danger.\"\n\nI didn't know what she meant, but her words stayed with me as I left the hospital and headed home.\n\nOver the next few days, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off about the woman's death. It was as if she had been trying to tell me something, and I knew I had to find out what it was.\n\nI began to investigate, and what I discovered was shocking. The woman had been part of a group of people who had gone missing in the woods a few months earlier. No one knew what had happened to them, but there were rumors of strange figures lurking in the shadows, watching from the trees.\n\nI knew I had to find the others, but I had no idea where to start. I searched the woods for days, my flashlight barely piercing the darkness as I called out for any sign of life.\n\nAnd then, one night, I heard a faint cry for help. I followed the sound to a clearing, and there, huddled in the center, were the missing people. They were scared and disoriented, but they were alive.\n\nI knew I had to get them out of there as quickly as possible. I led them through the woods, my heart racing as we ran through the darkness. And when we finally emerged from the trees and saw the headlights of a rescue vehicle, I knew we had made it.\n\nAs we were loaded into the ambulance, I couldn't shake the feeling that we were being watched. I turned around and saw a group of  figures standing in the trees, their eyes fixed on us as we drove away.\n\nI never knew who those figures were, or what they wanted from us. But I knew one thing for certain: we had narrowly escaped a fate worse than death.\n\nThe missing people were reunited with their families and, eventually, the investigation into their disappearance was closed. But I couldn't shake the feeling that we had only scratched the surface of what had really happened in those woods.\n\nTo this day, I still wonder about the strange figures that lurked in the shadows, watching us as we fled for our lives. And I can't help but feel that, one day, they'll come back for us.",

        "text": "As my eyesight started to adjust to the serene yet eerie woodland surrounding me, my imagination started to create varying shadowy figures from all angles. My eyes repeatedly and intensely fixated on the uncanny nothingness I had conjured from a lifetime of watching horror movies and late night Reddit scrolling. I quickly turned my torch back on. \n\nI kept forcing my inner monologue to at least attempt to comfort me, “This is what you came for.” I’d weakly chant in my head. \n\nThe truth is I was ill prepared and stupid for putting myself in this situation in the first place. I come from a rural town in the U.K but that was nothing compared to what I was now faced with. Millions of acres of a US national forest overwhelmed me as they would most, if only that anxiety was the pinnacle of what I experienced that night. \n\nMy wife had passed recently and her life insurance policy left me a little money spare. We’d always talked about going to the states together, to go into one of these ancient forests to see whether we might be the lucky ones who caught a glimpse of something seemingly otherworldly. Four weeks ago I’d decided that now I could afford it, I’d go and search for the both of us. I booked a cabin on AirB&amp;B and got on the first flight I could. When I landed and got through passport control, I hired a car and made my way to my destination only stopping to devour what can only be described as the most overindulgent plate of what locals would call breakfast I’ve ever eaten. \n\nI arrived at the cabin after about 5 hours on the road. I’d been in communication with the owners since I landed and they said there was no need for me to meet them. They explained they had stocked the fridge and left the keys on the kitchen counter as the door was unlocked, along with some other menial information. \n\nThe lane up to the cabin was rough, and the journey had been exhausting. I dropped my bags in the doorway and walked back outside to take in the environment around me, I was in the middle of these great woods, completely alone and miles away from any civilisation. I’d made it. I went back into the cabin and lay down on the camp bed. I set an alarm for a few hours time so I would wake up at 9:00pm. It wasn’t like I needed to do anything until it got dark anyway, that was when they were most active. \n\nWhen I woke up I got dressed into frankly inappropriate attire for traversing the woods in the dark. It was summer, so I wasn’t overly worried about the elements but I still looked at my cheap utility boots thinking they probably weren’t up to the task. I packed a rucksack with some food and water, a first aid kit and bear spray all of which I found in the cabin. I grabbed my torch, which was the only item in my pack I felt any sort of confidence in, and set out. Before I left I did look back over my shoulder at what I assume was an old hunting rifle above the log burner, but I’ve never even held a gun let alone shot one and I wasn’t expecting to need to shoot anything anyway. \n\nI walked along a trail in the forest for a few miles and much to my dismay. I saw very few signs of anything at all, I couldn’t even really hear much over my own footsteps and the odd rise in the wind which wasn’t very loud even at its peak. Wildlife seemed non existent and I did my best to ignore the nagging voice in my head telling me I came all this way for nothing. \n\nI eventually came to a small clearing which is when I decided I would sit and wait to see if anything would come to me, rather than continuing to trudge further through this unfamiliar land and further from the cabin. \n\nI turned my torch off. I figured nothing would come towards me with this giant beam of light penetrating the circling tree line. That’s when I first started to feel fear as my mind began to race. \n\nI turned the torch back on. I felt guilty for doing so, like I was already letting fear get the better of me, like I was letting myself or my wife down. I thought to myself, “I’ll turn it back off in a minute, I’ll just check the perimeter first.” The trees surrounding the clearing were around 20ft away, and I was right there in the middle of them. As I turned to my left, slowly moving my torch along and squinting, I saw two hands grasping a tree and the top of what looked like a head pointed out. At first I was taken aback and froze in fear. My torch light remained fixed on the figure that I had decided was definitely real and I came to the conclusion that it looked human. \n\nI called out...\n\n“Hey is uhhh... is someone there?”\n\n“You don’t wanna be here.” \n\nThe response to my call was louder than I’d anticipated it to be. My brain once again raced, my inner monologue no longer offering any sort of comfort. “Here we bloody go” I thought defeatedly, the wrong turn movies and stories I’d read on feral men in the woods all came rushing to mind. \n\n“I’m staying at a cabin north of here, I just wanted to take a walk.” I exclaimed back trying my best to sound calm and unfazed. \n\nThe figure revealed itself into the light. It was a man dressed in what looked like muddied rags, he was barefoot and his arms and legs were mostly exposed. He had scraggly grey hair and a thick beard. He was old and thinner than your average person. He was quite pale and looked malnourished as if he'd been out here for some time. \n\nHe stood in front of the tree he had appeared from behind. \n\n“Where ya from?” he said matching the volume and tone I had projected to him. \n\n“England” I quickly replied. Still pointing my torch firmly in his direction. I remember thinking he didn’t seem to mind the high powered beam of light shooting straight into his eyes. \n\n“And what’re you really doing out here?” \n\nI paused, maybe he just lived out here off grid and he could help me find what I was looking for. Then again he could react differently, I had no idea how he’d react, I had no idea what this man was even doing here and I wasn’t sure I wanted to. But I did decide to tell him what I really wanted. \n\nJust as I was about to explain, the man sharply turned his head to look behind him from the tree he’d appeared from as if he'd heard or sensed something I hadn't. He took one look back at me and I saw his face had changed from a curious gaze, to a look of pity. He turned back the way he came and began to walk, briskly, making almost no noise as he did. \n\nHe knew something, he’d *seen* something. Up until this point the interaction had happened so fast I hadn’t had time to reflect. But my gut told me. To see what I wanted to, I’d need to follow. \n\nHe never looked back as we moved through the forest further and further away from the cabin. He never stopped or went out of sight. I stayed a good ten feet behind him and kept the torch on him at all times. I was aware I could be walking into danger, but something inside was dragging me after him. \n\nI followed for only about 20 minutes, it was mostly uphill and we came to a small cliff top with about a 30ft drop overlooking more seemingly endless trees below, only visible due to the almost full moon and clear sky.\n\nThe man sat and stared into the darkness in front of him. I noticed a small sort of primitive camp set up around him, there was no tent but it looked like he’d been sleeping on an old bedroll directly laying on the rock and I could see the remnants of a small fire. \n\n“They took her.” He whispered quietly, I was unsure if he was talking to himself or me. I got the feeling that making the choice to follow him was then wrong one and I’m sure that’s hardly a surprise to you. I thought it is very likely that I’ve just followed a forest dwelling maniac to his lair, yet I was compelled to try and find out more. \n\n“Who?” I replied now stood only a few feet behind the strange man. I hoped he’d elaborate with context explaining who “her” was and also “who” had taken said woman. \n\n“Angie” he muttered, “9 weeks.” \n\n“Is…is that your wife?” I asked calmly perching myself next to him but far enough away that if he’d lunge, I’d have some time to react. \n\nHe pointed out to the wilderness in front of him. His eyes fixed on a seemingly uninteresting patch of woods.\n\nI moved closer to try and see exactly where he was pointing but it all looked the same to me, I started to feel sorry for the man, I’d heard of people going missing in American forests and then thought of my own wife. I felt this encounter was fated as I may be somebody who can understand his pain. I realised the man must of been out out here searching.\n\nThen I heard a very faint scream in the distance. \n\nThat’s the last thing I remember before I awoke to find what I’d only ever dreamt of finding although in retrospect it really was always going to be more of a nightmare. \n\nThe first thing I felt was my hair being oddly damp. I was lying on my side and raised my right arm to feel my head, as soon as I touched it I felt a wave of pain. I couldn’t be sure how severe it was, this all happened in seconds but even in my dazed and confused state, I could tell something had hit me in the head - hard, and the dampness was likely blood although it was too dark to tell for sure at that point. \n\nThen I felt another sensation on my left ankle. This wasn’t a pain as such although I would say it was more than uncomfortable. It felt like something had gripped my foot and most of my shin. Then I started to move but not by my own volition. I struggled in the darkness as I was dragged across the forest floor, the moonlight now subdued by the leafy canopy above my head. The blood on my face and the lack of light made it hard to see what was pulling me along with ease but I could make out a huge silhouette in front of me. I’m not sure how long I was dragged for, I was in and out of consciousness, exasperated by my head injury and the bursts of movement I would try to conjure to escape the grasp of the mysterious forest beast, the grip never seemed to loosen and my fight or flight senses had dwindled leaving me only able to freeze and allow myself to be pulled along further. The sticks and rocks underneath me scathing my back and the bumping uneven terrain below were the least of my worries I remember thinking. \n\nI must have fallen unconscious again, because this time I awoke to the same screaming I’d heard just before except now it was much louder. I was now lying on my back, and the grip on my ankle had gone completely. I slowly lifted my head up and looked forward, propping myself up on my elbows.\n\nThat’s when I saw what I’d came all this way to see. The first thing I noticed was the legs, skinny yet long and fully covered in thick, grotesque hair except for the knees, which seemed to reveal grey skin in the parts that were more exposed. My eyes slowly moved up to a stocky well built body again covered in thick matted hair. That’s when my eyes met its. They glowed a strange amber colour and although at first I thought it was looking straight at me, I now think it was looking straight through me. \n\nMy other senses came flooding back to me, as if when I looked at the the creature I was initially reduced to sight only. The screaming was coming from behind the beast and it sounded like a woman being tormented horribly. I’d never heard a human scream like that but I was pretty sure it was in fact human. Then the stench overwhelmed me, it smelt like rotting meat, like if you’ve ever been in close proximity to a slaughter house and a huge wet dog at the same time. Then I myself began to scream as I attempted to stand. \n\nI was quickly knocked back down, the 8ft figure just in front of me squatted down and extended its arm. A huge grey leathery hand pushed me back to the ground before I could even fully get up. As it did, I was able to make out more features of its face. The glowing eyes were small and deep set, the creature had a heavy brow, and what I first thought to be more of its head looked like matted dreadlocks of hair cascading down to its shoulders. Its mouth was as wide as it’s face, and as it pushed me it bared a set of large yellow incisors and growled deeply. \n\nDuring this interaction the screaming coming from behind what you’ve probably realised was a Sasquatch, had ceased. The creature was towering over me as I then found myself in foetal position shaking uncontrollably.\n\nI heard a strange chattering sound coming from behind the ape like being and then it opened its mouth to create a similar noise back in response. The screaming then started again, from both me and the other unfortunate party in this hellish environment. \n\n“NO MORE NO MORE!” I could make out before the woman desperately returned to her shrill screaming as words failed her. \n\nThen suddenly, I heard a gun shot. The creature in front of me dropped heavily to its knees, gurgling blood before it fell back in a huge slump.\n\nThe strange man from before came back into view right in front of me but just to the right, he must of shot the creature from just behind where I was and then moved around me. He then headed off running without even a glance in my direction, straight towards the screaming woman. \n\nAt that point, I once again attempted to get to my feet, this time successfully and I turned in opposite direction and ran.\n\nEven after running for what felt like half an hour, I could still hear that woman scream, along with a devilish high pitched whooping sound coming from that awful place. I somehow found my way back to the trail that led me to the cabin. The keys to the hire car were inside on the mantle piece, I burst through the door. My eyes stinging from sweat and blood and my breathing intense and erratic. \n\nI grabbed the keys and headed for the car when I froze once more in the doorway. I turned my head again to where the rifle was once suspended yet it was no longer there. I barrelled into the car and took the lane back towards the town I’d past a few miles before. \n\nI woke up in the hospital the next day. The doctors told me I’d passed out at the wheel due to shock, luckily I’d taken my foot off the accelerator and the car was stationary on a road where passers by had called the authorities. The injury on my head had been patched up and they told me it wasn’t too serious although it did bleed a lot, other than that I was just bruised and exhausted. \n\nThey told me there were some police officers that were on their way to take a statement and then left me to gather my strength to recount the tale. \n\nMy phone had been in the inside pocket of my jacket the whole time and was laid out with the rest of my possessions on a table at the other side of the room. I got up and grabbed it. I thought it’d help the police if I got the cabins details from the AirB&amp;B app so they could send help to the man and woman still in the forest, if they were still alive that is. \n\nMy own profile on AirB&amp;B is what opened the floodgates of emotion I’ve still yet to process. \n\nMy profile picture was of me and my late wife and I felt a strange sense of relief that she wasn’t around to live with the horror we’d both longed to experience together. I checked the booking confirmation which apart from the date/time and accommodation was all pre-filled from the countless trips my wife and I had taken before her passing, I’d even accidentally booked for 2 guests out of habit.\n\n I then went onto the cabin’s page and looked at the hosts profile picture. An elderly couple, Bob and Angie.\n\nI then checked the past reviews, something I’d failed to do in my excitement previously. The last review was from a man who’d booked the cabin a couple of weeks prior to me, it read \n\n“Extremely disappointed with the service from the host.  I booked the stay for me and my girlfriend but a family matter stopped her from attending. When I arrived the host asked me where the other guest was. When I explained my situation to him, he became very irate and aggressively forced me to leave.” \n\nI now feel I understand what desperate measures Bob was taking to try and save his wife, I mean I know I would go to extreme lengths to get mine back from the abyss.Maybe even if it meant offering some kind of messed up trade that resulted in someone else *losing theirs*.",

        "text": "I’m writing this down as a recount of the past two weeks. Right now, I’m uncertain as to what will happen with this; it may just sit gathering dust in my OneDrive. In any case, I’ll decide on that later once I’ve had the chance to get everything down, make everything concrete, a quick snapshot of a sandcastle before the tides claw it back out to sea.\n\nThe visions first came on the evening my older brother was supposed to return from the correctional halfway house up in the city. Bec and I perched ourselves on the verandah, where the slope upon which the family home sat offered an unencumbered view of the main road and the highway out of Liverpool Valley, a single ebbing tear in the ridges that enclosed us and kept us apart from the noisier suburbs up north. It was 35 degrees out and the afternoon sun was on life-support. Everything looked like a mirage, so we had to squint to see if my parents’ red Land Rover was coming back into town at the time they had promised.\n\nBec had high-tailed it home after the Year 7 sports carnival and hadn’t changed out of her half-cotton, half-mud uniform, and I was still in my hospitality blacks, smelling like vinegar and mould from my 1990 Corolla shit-box. We were both eager, but I couldn’t help but feel stuck to the porch floorboards, whirling in place, as my parents’ SUV came hurtling down the main road, half an hour earlier than they’d said they’d be in the morning.\n\n“Already here! I’ll get the goodies out of the fridge.” Bec was practically bouncing. She ran inside without closing the door behind her. I scolded her with a shout.\n\nWe moved to the edge of the driveway. I had a hand on my hip and the other shielding my eyes from the sunset’s glare. Bec had William’s favourite treat—Ben and Jerry’s ice cream—nestled in an elbow-carried esky. As my parents’ car pulled in, I frantically searched for the third figure somewhere in the backseat. My focus was darting past my mother and father at that point, but from the brief glimpse I caught of their faces, all I remember seeing was blankness. Like they were staring through me, through the house, glazing over in the last orange breaths of daylight in the far distance.\n\n“Sorry, my sweeties,” my father said, stepping out of the car and making his way onto the verandah, “something happened with Will. He’s not coming home tonight.”\n\nThere it was. My gut feel was right. I looked over at Bec and she was frozen over, distraught. She held the ice cream still and mother came over, patting Bec’s shoulder. “You went to quite the effort there, sweetie.”\n\nMy father sighed and snatched the small tub of ice cream as he ascended back to the front door. “Heaven’s sake Rebecca, that’s going to spoil now. How long have you had that out here?”\n\nThe routine. Make us sweet so that we know with clarity when things are bitter, and they were bitter always. In joined hands mother and father will give you a tiara only so they can have the pleasure of removing it when you least expect. I was already souring, wilting, knowing that the one member of my family who had left home and tried (poorly, admittedly) to do something for themselves was no longer returning. And now, a pointless putdown around ice cream.\n\n“How was Bec supposed to know you weren’t bringing Will home?” I asked, staying put next to the driveway. A risk.\n\nThe air grew heavier, and father wheeled around. “Would it be so hard to keep that *shit* in the freezer? Aren’t you the culinary whiz, always poking around and nagging whenever we try to cook you kids a meal? You’re the one that has to teach her common sense. We’ve been out in the city all day, and you’ve been here, doing what?”\n\n“Dad, I think you’re over—”\n\nHe stepped back out into the sun, towering from the top step of the verandah. “A worthless remote Diploma in Arts from a university in another state, plus a dodgy cook’s apprenticeship from up the road. Completely unable to guide our youngest while we’re away. Add that on top of Will getting into a fight in pre-release, sending him back into deep lock-up. And you lot want to criticise.”\n\nMother piled on, eyes never meeting mine, before following my father as he stomped back into the house. “You know how he gets. Get sorted out here and get ready for dinner. We’ll just eat the leftovers you brought home yesterday.”\n\nShe left, and it was just Bec and I out the front once again. If you’re on my regular email bitching-session pen-pal list, you’ll recognise this kind of reactionary, atomic parenting as being a constant in my life.\n\nI stood there for a bit, regarding the front of our regular home, wedged between a dozen other regular homes on our block and tried to comfort my sister as I continued to melt in the heat. “I’m not mad at you, and I don’t think you did anything wrong, Bec.”\n\nNo response.\n\nI looked down at her, tugged at her shoulder and she turned to me and that’s when it started. Bec faced me with pallid skin, grey from the cold even though our entire street was blanketed in amber, what looked like rain drops slowly tracing down the contours of her face, her ponytail sharpened and black as though drenched in water. Just like those times when she’s been late walking home on a rainy day and mother and father pretended not to hear her shouts over the telly, just to teach her a lesson in being on time. Dripping, grey, spluttering in terror. “Belle,” she whispered, arms outstretched.\n\nI blinked and turned away, trying to reorient myself into the reality I hoped still existed around me on the street, the warm remains of the day. It was mostly there. But right in the middle of the road, I saw my Corolla, bleached white as though painted by headlights, floating, crumpling like a paper bag being pressed against an invisible wall. I was in the driver’s seat, shrieking, the engine block and windshield breaking into a constellation of white-hot shards peeling my face inwards and sending my jaw folding backwards into my throat and I turned back to Bec and she stared at me, with gaping holes for eyes and a mouth. Not even sockets—just pits that dropped into blackness. “Belle, Belle, Belle…”\n\n“Belle!” Bec was shaking my upper thigh. “Why’d you turn away from me?”\n\nI blinked again, and I was back to feeling the remnants of the sun on my skin—no more water, no more blinding lights, just the soft glow of the afternoon. I could see Bec’s eyes, her mouth; dry, untouched. I glanced behind me to the street and it was empty—nothing but the neighbours across the way in their neat little bungalows.\n\n“I’m sorry, Bec. Not feeling crash hot. You did nothing wrong, in any case.” She went inside, and I remained on the verandah for a few minutes, trembling, even in the heat.\n\nI remember skipping dinner that night. I laid in my room, curtains drawn and air-con on full blast with an icy flannel draped over my forehead. Light sounds of splashing as Bec and mother hopped into the pool (a mandated hour after dinner, at least) ticked the one window I had. Like a cell.\n\nProbably not too different from the one I had envisaged Will in; the furnishings were certainly more homely, but the concept was all the same. Little hamlets like Liverpool Valley became their own Colorbond gulag archipelagos stretched across well-paved streets, run by little feudal lords in little houses, gifting shelter, community, home, with a warmth so heavy it was humid and you had to swim through it, all in exchange for your unending gratitude and loyalty—to hell with the fact there were as many opportunities for the Valley’s ten-thousand or so high-school leavers as there were fingers on my left hand. And the kids around here pay in kind, mostly, albeit with the all too frequent case of a disappearance, “sudden” passing deemed “not suspicious” by the cops, or the psychotic episode ending in jail time. Dime a dozen here, as it would be in many small Australian towns, but a bit more-so than the average.\n\nI don’t know how long it was that my father was staring at me from a crack in the door, one eye peering in. But I eventually turned and spotted him. He entered.\n\n“Sorry about earlier, my sweet. You know you’re always our little buttercup.” He leaned in quickly, before I could move, and kissed me wetly on the forehead. “I just…” He started fiddling with one of the soft toys on my shelf—one that he had put there himself out of nostalgia, as I'd hated that unicorn from about the time I started wearing pads—and set it on my laptop keyboard. “I just need you to know how much it helps when we’re all in this together, to help your little sister grow up.”\n\n“Yes, Dad.”\n\nHe smiled. Patted my bare foot. “Heatstroke got you down?”\n\nI decided to test the waters, just slightly, “I think I was seeing things.”\n\nWhat father did then was in theme with all the other ways he’s dealt with me in the last 22 years of my life, but this time I felt he was stowing something away. He did the stare again; like his pupils were drilling into something beyond me, far away, through my skull, and bedsheets, and carpet, and deep into nothingness. He came to after a moment. “You don’t need to worry, sweet. It’s not real.”\n\nI blinked again. “I didn’t even tell you what I saw.”\n\n“It’s not real. It’s the heat.”\n\n“We’ve had weather like this before, and I haven’t seen things before. This was different. Almost lucid.”\n\n“Almost real, but not real. Not in the slightest.” He squeezed my shoulder, unblinking. Still towering over my incapacitated, clammy self. He kissed my forehead again and withdrew to the hallway. “You’re a smart cookie, diploma and all—these things happen. If it happens again, just remember it’s nothing but your imagination. Your mother and I love having you around and we couldn’t imagine losing you. I know how much you’ve supported us over the past few years, Mum being unable to work, and all. And now we need to make sure Rebecca grows up strong. So, you’ve got to stay strong for us. For her.”\n\nI must have fallen asleep as soon as he left, because everything went black and my body woke up in a call of nature just past midnight, forcing me to stumble my way through the house towards the bathroom. The family wasn’t a fan of nightlights, the Valley was devoid of human activity beyond nine in the evening, and the sky had become overcast, blotting out the moonlight.\n\nOnce I felt the bathroom doorframe I stepped in and switched on the light. That was the second time it happened. The hairs on my neck straightened, breaking the prisons of dried sweat that had enclosed them hours since and standing erect under the fluorescent lighting. I was face-to-face in the mirror with myself, but it wasn’t me; not just yet.\n\n“*Wait. Wait. Wait.”*\n\nThe jaw I had in my reflection was hanging by a thread, barely visible, struck back into the blotted shadows of my hair. Across my eyelids, nose, cheekbone, was a forest of red dashes, like a storm surge pushing tracts of bloody poplars and pines across the soil of my skin, streaked in charred crimson. Blizzards of glass and metal weaving right into me. That thing—that version of *me*—was my reflection. And all it said was “*Wait. Wait. Wait.*”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe weather passed more temperamentally over the following week, moving from the mid-thirties down to chilling nights with the occasional rain, as it is known to do nowadays. Dress for two different seasons in a day, depending on when you needed to be out and about. Liverpool Valley did that to its residents. It’s probably not a surprise that handfuls of its residents went loopy each year when the weather rocks the town on its axis and has you running port to starboard and back again. Everything settles into a mirage, like that first day I had those visions.\n\nThis time though, it was a chance encounter at work that set my innards off-kilter. He was a bearded guy, dressed in Target tradesperson gear with tattoos down his neck and at the far edges of his cheekbones. A friend of Will’s. He approached me as I was staffing the till.\n\nHe nodded, and I returned the gesture. He was nice enough in school. Eventually ended up staying in the Valley with cement around his ankles though, after doing a stint in lock-up thanks to a botched ram raid borne out of testosterone and youthful stupidity. After that, no one except the local cement terminal would take him, ironically.\n\n“Sorry to hear about Will.” He said.\n\n“Shit happens.”\n\n“Thought he wanted out of this town. Didn’t know he wanted it that much.”\n\n“’Institutionalised’, I guess. Like that old Shawshank movie.”\n\nA smirk. Will’s friend tapped his card to pay for a coffee. “That’s one way to put it, mate.” He paused, walked towards the door, but came back again, clearly struggling to lay out plain something that was on his mind. “Look, I know us blokes never really get too close to each other, and I want to respect whatever you and the folks want to do. But if you do have a funeral or something like that, I’d like to be there. For old times’ sake.”\n\nI was hammering my forehead with the palm of my hand the first chance I had, reading my phone in the storage room out back. How could I have not seen this? I just took my father’s word for it and went on with my day, supine in the darkness of my room, unquestioning of his truth. I read it again when I got home that afternoon, just sitting in my car with the air-con on blast on the front lawn.\n\nI looked at myself in the rear-view mirror. My eyelids were shredded and dangling, deep red on the undersides like paperbark. A pressing sensation came upon my lower face, and I felt my sinuses clear in a jet-like flush, and then everything started to sting. I whirled around in my seat, looking to see if Bec was anywhere in sight, but she was not. Probably inside doing homework. I looked back in the mirror, and it was just my light brown eyes staring back. My phone finished loading.\n\nOnly the city papers reported it, not venturing beyond a handful of paragraphs. Buried deep in the state-specific filters of the website. Death in custody. Will didn’t even make it to the pre-release halfway house in the city, judging by the date. Took his own life with his sheets. Police and Corrections enquiries continuing.\n\nFather was sitting at the TV at the time, the curtains half drawn in the living room despite the gentle offerings of afternoon light dancing around outside. He sat in shadowed darkness, the contours of his work shirt highlighted by the white glow of a Master Chef re-run. It flickered when I looked at it, old static-like, even though it was digital. An ad for a Corolla flashed on the screen. It jittered, again and again. I looked back at my father. He didn’t blink.\n\n“How’s it going buttercup?”\n\nRubbing my temples, I tried not to focus on the TV. I pushed my smartphone to his face, with the news article loaded. “Why did you lie?”\n\nFather put his drink down at the foot of the sofa and increased the volume on the TV. Mother sat in the far corner—I didn’t see her at first—blowing her nose into a handkerchief. “I told you what happened,” he said.\n\n“What happened in the city, and why did you lie to Bec and I the other night?”\n\n\"You wouldn’t have understood—we’ve kept you and your siblings safe for so many years. You always make this about you and your needs, Belle. Do you ever stop to think that sometimes the adults just need room to breathe?” He didn’t turn from the TV. The Corolla was still stuck in a freeze-frame field of white noise, unmoving. Both of my parents didn’t peel from the screen, their gaze darting about its face. Surely they weren’t just looking at this old car ad?\n\n“I’m fucking 22; almost 23.” I retorted.\n\nHe turned to me, and mother looked down, silent as ever. “And you better watch your language. I can make things hard for you; that’ll be something to be angry about.”\n\n“Can you just step out of your recliner for just one second, and answer my questions? Why did you hide his death from us? From Bec, maybe I can figure that out. But you haven’t said a thing to me since.”\n\nNothing.\n\nI pressed. “Are you guilty that you stopped letting him see Dr. Wang down at the clinic?”\n\n“Dr. Wang was a quack, and you know it.” He was standing now, and he moved to draw the blinds completely closed. “Couldn’t keep her own house in order. And you want her to treat the ‘mental health’ of my son when she should’ve focused on keeping her own kids alive, and probably should’ve also focused on another specialisation as well. We need good backs and knees out here. Not her kind of skillset. Everything else, a real Aussie can deal with in his own time.”\n\n“You stack pallets at a warehouse. You’re not feeding the nation.”\n\n“I feed you; isn’t that enough?” He stepped towards me, and I withdrew slowly to the hallway that funnelled towards my bedroom. “All of this is because of you. How could we afford any sort of appointment with Dr. Wang, even if we wanted to, while you’re sticking around here? You think your little cash register gig pays the bills? I’ve broken my back here supporting you and your mother for years, and all you care about is what your deadshit brother got up to.”\n\n“That’s your son—”\n\n“And he’s not here because he wasn’t a man. He couldn’t focus on what was real and what wasn’t—” he grabbed my wrist.\n\nA short, sharp gasp from somewhere in the TV-bathed shadows. Bec, from the doorway of her own bedroom, observing the way father had clutched me, disciplined me. Was she crying? I couldn’t tell from where I stood. Her eyes looked like shadows from where I stood, no pupils, no whites. None of the lights were on and the curtains had been drawn shut. My breath must have quickened, because father picked up on it.\n\n“Look what you’ve done to your sister.” He loosened his grip. “Always hunting for the drama, you are. I don’t care if you’re having one of your visions or divine visitations again because I’ll tell you right now, that shit isn’t real.”\n\nI looked into his eye. Bloodshot, and pleading. Like the eyes of a bull terrier biting, but out of fear. I was used to the gaslighting; but whenever it reached the topic of hallucinating, seeing things, my brain, and all that, I had noticed my father start to trickle out of his shell and glaze over. I hadn’t even mentioned the visions this time.\n\nFather let go completely and I pulled away from him. I slinked down the hallway and drew Bec into her room, dragging the door closed behind us.\n\n“Are you okay, Belle? He’s in one of those moods again.”\n\nI nodded. “Sorry you had to see that. I reckon we’ll lay low today, maybe tomorrow. Day after he should be back to normal.” We were both used to the merry-go-round, navigating the swings and roundabouts of his ill temper.\n\n“He said you were seeing things?”\n\nIt was hard for me to reply—I must’ve just stared at Bec with my mouth slightly open. She looked normal now, but all I could remember was the way she looked that afternoon the week prior, dripping wet and sunken.\n\n“Mum said the same thing to me after I got home yesterday. Grabbed my arm as well, super serious.”\n\n“She what?”\n\n“Yeah, I think I tripped on the verandah steps coming up, according to her at least.”\n\nI leaned in closer, sweat building at my temples. “What happened? Did you hit your head?”\n\nBec shook her head. “Don’t think so. It was like I was watching myself, like I was suddenly floating above my body and the front yard. Mum had to shake me out of it. And there was this sound of a train, just getting louder and louder, like when the coal trains come through the station. Loud enough to burst my eardrums, probably. I looked down at the version of me on the verandah steps and I was just covered in white light. It also wasn’t the verandah anymore. It looked like rail tracks.”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI stopped staring into mirrors over the days following that conversation and tried to remain focused on whatever I was doing at the time. No daydreaming. No leaning when I could have been cleaning. I didn’t want to give an opening for the hallucinations to come spilling out again, although as hard as I tried there would always be a glimmer of my white car in the distance, folding in upon itself. My sister, half-girl, half-shadow like a baroque painting.\n\nBut it was never too constricting, I found. So I kept on, told Bec to keep her nose down and ignore these things that weren’t really there, and pushed through the week without much trouble. I don’t know how she was going with her visions.\n\nThe day came around. Bec finished early at her class excursion to the local tip, so we had a couple of hours to kill before the parental curfew came into effect. We buckled into my car—I think I triple checked her seatbelts and my brakes while pulling out onto the road—and bee-lined for Dr. Wang’s house.\n\nFrom when I was younger, I remembered that she took Thursdays off in exchange for working over the weekend, and prayed that was still the case. Nothing changes much here anyway, although Dr. Wang has probably seen her patient numbers drop precipitously after most of the Valley’s general practitioners—her included—stopped offering bulk-billed services. Also stopped doing mental health work and instead started referring people up to the city, after her kids passed. So, I guess things do change, but mostly under the cover of night.\n\nEverything looked grey when we pulled onto the grass in front of Dr. Wang’s house—a squat, fibro square with security shutters and ADT stickers on every corner. And whoever wasn’t deterred by that would have probably been scared off by the thought of brown snakes in her unkempt yard. The Valley was apparently leaning into the coldest, wettest summer on record, so the sky was overcast and suffocating. Thunder rolled lightly, far beyond the Valley ridges.\n\nWe found her waiting for us through the screen door, leaning on the wall. She didn’t unlock it. I think she might have recognised us.\n\n“You have my condolences. But I’m sorry, I’m off work at the moment.”\n\nI pulled Bec closer to my side. She was still partly confused as to why we’d come to this side of town just to see Will’s old GP. “Sorry, Dr. Wang. Can appreciate that. Just had a few questions though… we can’t really afford the appointments, and even if we could you’re booked out until March.”\n\nDr. Wang crossed her arms.\n\n“We’re having some sort of mental health episode, the two of us. Seeing things that aren’t there.”\n\n“Fluids?”\n\n“Always.”\n\n“Sleep? Head injuries?”\n\n“Regular as ever. None.”\n\nThe doctor scanned us both up and down. “What do you see in these episodes?”\n\nI looked down at Bec. Sent her back to wait in the car. She stomped around a little, claiming that she was fine to deal with grown-up talk since mother and father did it so often, but I raised my voice a little, causing her to recoil.\n\nIt was just Dr. Wang and I now.\n\n“My own death, I guess. What looks like a car crash. I feel things too—sharp jolts of pain, tingling, as though I was experiencing it first-hand. I think Bec is the same. Out of body experience. Like she’s watching herself get hit by a train.”\n\nDr. Wang tapped at a loose floorboard, head down. The socks she was wearing looked browned with dirt, unchanged, wrapped in dust bunnies. “Shouldn’t have sent her away. Best to be honest with the kids.”\n\n“I didn’t come here for a lecture on how to raise a sister.”\n\n“I didn’t open my door to give you an hour-long appointment and a mental health plan.” She was pissed now. “You people are always up in my shit. Run around calling me the childless widow but the moment you realise you’re not coping with life, for whatever reason, you come running. And better yet, you never admit it to anyone, because you’re too ashamed to. And what’s more? When I give you advice, you can’t hack it.”\n\n“I never called you—”\n\n“You know what I mean.” She grabbed the edge of the door, threatening to close me out fully. “Do you even know what happened to your brother? Did Will ever tell you anything? Every second day he said his bedsheets would spiral into a snake and yell at him with the gruff voice of a prison warden. It would coil at his throat, pulling, and he’d come to in a dripping mess of pain. Yelling in his head, all the time.”\n\nI thought about it and felt that whirling-in-place sensation again. My feet were planted, but my guts were peeling outwards and in again like a tangled pendulum. Mother and father had always said that communications with Will were strict, out in prison. Give them the letters, and they’ll take them over when they visit. And the prison rarely does visits. And only one person, when the visit does happen, thus says the father. I hadn’t spoken to my brother since he was taken in two years ago, but mother and father have. They say they have.\n\n“I won’t say much in the interest of privacy, even though he’s dead now, but you need to get your issues checked out, or just find a way to get out of this bloody town. It suffocates you. Will knew it, and he found ways to get out but I guess he never succeeded.\n\n“The police operation he was ‘arrested’ in? He tried throwing himself on the tracks down at the station. Technically a police operation, and technically he was taken into custody. But he was admitted to a hospital up closer to the city, not a jail, at first. Released after a few evaluations, and I guess when he was trying to find some money to get by—not sure if he wanted to come back down here—that’s when he got properly pinched. He was in jail for just over half a year, not two.\n\n“And yes, I know how you’re feeling right now, but you need to hear it. This town is no good. You all know how it took my kids, my husband. It’ll gaslight you into a sense of security, with all the quiet roads, its warm blanket of halcyon dreams this country hasn’t seen since the 50s. But it eats you quietly, and blossoms when you, either by your own actions or some haunted mystery, end up never leaving.”\n\nI turned around. Bec was motionless in my car’s backseat. My legs started to withdraw from Dr. Wang’s front door, but something in my mind was searching for more.\n\n“Dr. Wang, what are you talking about? You think this town has feelings, arms, hands? I’m seeing these bloody things in my *head*, I thought this whole mental health thing was your speciality?”\n\n“But you feel it still, don’t you? You’re not just seeing things. Will knew. I know.”\n\nI couldn’t respond. My hand traced the front of my face, where I had felt the piercing burn of glass daggers just days ago.\n\n“Just get out of here, out of this town.” She pulled closer to her screen door, almost whispering. “Get out of here. I know what it’s like, and I survived it. But for you, you just need to get out of here before it takes its toll. It takes its toll. It takes its toll.”\n\nCrazy. Absolutely crazy, was what I thought as I backed away even more. No wonder she had stopped taking these kinds of appointments. And how the hell would she have helped Will? If what she said was true, I can’t see how any of this widowed, lonely ramble would have helped Will more than it would have pushed him onto those train tracks two years ago.\n\nBut she wasn’t closing her door. Still staring at me, she was, mumbling those last few words. It takes its toll. I don’t know why I did this. Maybe I was on autopilot from the adrenaline of having multiple realities shattered into splinters before my eyes. I went back to her screen door and asked her, leaning right in.\n\n“Then how did you get through it all? How did you survive?”\n\nA laugh. Never a good sign when someone starts laughing in a situation like this. “I noticed I could put the visions at bay,” she said. “Just keep telling yourself it’s not real. Better yet, tell your mothers, fathers, sisters, it’s not real. None of it is real. I told my kids and my husband, oh my dear husband. It’s not real. None of it. And they believed me. And I survived.”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe sun was starting to set, the day dipping into a more sombre, steely blue, and I was going above the speed limit to get Bec closer to home.\n\n“Belle, I don’t like how you didn’t let me listen.”\n\n“That conversation was getting rough. No point having you listen to that old doctor ramble like that.”\n\n“Well did she give you any medicine?”\n\nThe lights turned red and a convoy of trucks shipping in goods from the city’s port rushed past. I looked back down at Bec, her ponytail folded against the seat, face that of an exhausted puppy. “Doesn’t work like that. But she’s given us some things to try.”\n\n“I’m going to be late home. Dad might make me stand out in the rain again, if it does start pouring.”\n\nI looked at the time. Heaven’s sake. The lights were still red, so I looked far down the road on our left—the usual route—and saw that the city trucks were causing gridlock the whole length of the way. Didn’t help that it coincided with the one hour of traffic in the afternoon where everyone started their trips home.\n\nWhen the lights turned green I moved a block ahead and then took a weaving route to the lowest point of the main road. Just a light jog to the top of the hill and Bec would be home on time. That way, I could easily make my way to where I needed to go next.\n\n“Belle, it’s starting to drizzle! And you’re stopping here? You want me to run up the hill?”\n\n“You’ll be right. Harden up. I need to get some things, because I want to take us on a trip tomorrow. Just you and I.”\n\nHer eyes lit up. “Where to? What will Mum and Dad think?”\n\n“The city maybe. Not sure what they’ll do.”\n\n“Is it to get medicine? I can hear the trains again. They’re very loud.”\n\nShit. I looked at her. Dark circles were starting to form in her eyes and the pitter patter of rain began to drum on the bonnet. “Harden up, like I said before. Just stop thinking about it for tonight. Don’t tell Mum when she asks.”\n\nThe cloud-cover moving at speed overhead afforded some sunlight to creep in. Her eyes lightened, but without obscuring a wrinkled, almost wincing look she had on her face. She mumbled something and got out of the car.\n\n“Excuse me, Bec?”\n\n“It takes its toll.”\n\n“*What?*” It was hard not to shout that. My eyes shot open, window shutters gaping to let in breeze, new air, anything. From what I remembered at the time, she had been locked inside my car for most of the encounter with Dr. Wang.\n\nBec turned around, brow furrowed and hands rubbing her temples. “I didn’t say anything, stupid.”\n\nI was shaken by that point. Still jittering, I put the car back into drive. But I didn’t want to end it there, not just yet. I didn’t want to tell her what she was feeling wasn’t real. “You’ll be alright, Bec. I know what you’re feeling. I’ll be back soon—you just have to get through Mum and Dad while I’m out for a bit.”\n\nShe didn’t turn, and started shuffling up the hill. I didn’t waste time. I sped off in the opposite direction to the Woolworths grocer on the edge of town, which tended to be bigger, brighter, and better stocked that the food-marts scattered elsewhere for the locals.\n\nIt takes its toll. I heard it again, as though Bec herself was saying it. I looked around me and she hadn’t snuck back into the back seat, and all of my windows were up. The radio wasn’t on. It takes its toll. Like she was right in my ear.\n\nI turned the radio on and pumped the volume.\n\nBy the time I reached the grocer the rain and had started to fall in earnest, a million bullet-shaped waves crashing on shores of concrete, tin roofing, and brown grass. I was probably one of five people in the car park, and I ran like a drowned cat towards the store, dipped in the day’s decaying light. In the reflections of the Woolworths windows I was a hooded figure, with my hair wet and collapsed like fallow dirt upon the bedrock of my face, which was mostly a silhouette at this distance.\n\nFar behind me, in the reflection, my Corolla was hovering again, slowly brightening in a baptism of headlight fire, flattening against some invisible wall. I felt the pain again in my face, and everything below my nose became riven by jolts, waves of pain. I collapsed to my knees in a parking lot puddle. It took me a minute to come around, and I looked about just to make sure none of the cashiers had witnessed anything.\n\nSupplies for a weekend in the city. Maybe more? Who knows. Someone outside of this town would have to help with an urgent appointment. There was nothing within two hours’ worth of travel that could provide an urgent appointment, other than a couple of clinics in the city.\n\nAnd even then, it made me wonder—would it be so bad to find somewhere to stay up there? Use what little savings I was hoping to use on a new car to ride through a motel for a few weeks while I found a job and a cheap rental, and then maybe another job on top.\n\nPre-cooked canned food, beans, all the cheap stuff, and not an overpriced green veggie in sight. Pads, toiletries. I could probably stretch the budget to get a rice cooker too. Only person I knew who had one was the exchange student from a decade ago, and I saw him cook a whole chicken in there once, right on his bedroom floor.\n\n“Are there any sales on these?” I asked one of the shelf stockers.\n\n“Mate, that thing is so off-brand and cheap for what it is. It’s probably already three sales deep, when you think about it.”\n\nI laughed. He had a point. It felt like it was just us in the store, him doing a slow dance with the plastic cutlery he was stacking to some Triple-J rendition of a Frank Ocean song. Late Thursday nights. I guess the young guys on shift would switch away from the generic pop station. Anything to get over the extended hump day, as the rain started to enclose the grocer from outside, swallowing it and its lonely floodlights whole.\n\nHe turned back to me. “Those things can let you cook anything, anywhere, I hear.”\n\n“It’s why I’m getting it.”\n\n“Should’ve bought one when I was back living on campus. Would’ve been a step up from my cup noodles. Living like that. It takes its toll on you.”\n\n“Excuse me?” The rice cooker tumbled out of my hands and I had to catch it between my hip and the shelving.\n\nLike holes in a bowling ball, his face was. Pits where his eyes and mouth should have been. A noiseless air raid siren looking right back at me, skeletal, but not human. I was transported to that first time weeks ago, seeing those blackened bowls, valleys hewn into Bec’s dripping portrait. Again, I felt the sting of thousands of wasps on my eyelids and cheeks and I fell onto the lino, clutching my jaw as it collapsed into itself.\n\n“It takes its toll, you know, not having a properly cooked meal each night.” The shelf stocker scratched his head. “You okay there?”\n\nI filled my shopping bags at the self-checkout and hurried out of the store, the green cotton holding together my rice cooker and canned goods almost tearing at the seams. Dumping the bags in the boot of the car, I peeked through the windows to check it was empty. No ghosts, no hallucinations.\n\nI escaped the rain, hopping into the driver's seat. The sun, sheathed in clouds, was definitively set behind Liverpool Valley’s enclosing walls, leaving everything in front of me illuminated only by the grocery’s parking lot lighting.\n\nMy phone began to ring. Bec. She rarely used the outdated smartphone that father had given her—it sounded like an emergency.\n\n“Belle.” the voice was faint, whispering, perturbed by static; rain falling onto her phone, perhaps.\n\n“Bec! Are you alright?”\n\n“Dad locked me outside. I was late. I can see them in the living room watching the telly.” She sniffled. Crying. “I’m so cold.”\n\n“Bec, I’m coming back right now, wait there.”\n\n“He yells at me if I hide too far inside the verandah.” More rain. Where I was sitting at least, I could see it darting downwards at an angle, so Bec wouldn’t have much dry space to hide in. “Everything hurts. It’s like a bad headache all over.”\n\n“Wait. Wait. Wait. *What?* Is it the cold? Did Dad hit you?”\n\n“No, I don’t know what it is. I can hear the trains again. I told Dad before he locked me out and he yelled at me. He says it’s not real, but I can feel it and hear it all over.”\n\nAnd here I am, just finishing writing this up, trying to put everything down on a page and make this real. Sculpt it. Fossilise it. So that if anyone digs this up some time in the future there’s a record of all of this happening. My smartphone is heating up, having just got off the phone with Bec, and now churning what single-digit percentage of battery I have left into hot-spotting internet for my laptop, all so I can make this upload.\n\nIt’s hard to finish a sentence now. The way I ended the call with Bec. She wanted to know desperately that this haunting was not real, that all the pain she had shooting through her nerves was just a ghost. And all I said to her was to stay put, because I was coming. She just wanted to know, and I left her hanging, alone on those railroad tracks. It doesn’t help either that my jaw is numb, and that the rain is becoming torrential, and that my headlights are only doing so much in this weather where in every dark blot I can see a spectre of myself floating in mid-air, folded inwards like unearthly origami, flattening into a jungle of steel behind my steering wheel.\n\nI just want it to be over, but I *need* to get back to Bec. I can’t call her back—my phone probably won’t handle it—so I’ll have to drive, and on top of that, I don’t know what I’d say to her. If all of this is real, if it's not, or if we just need to get out of here.\n\nAll I can think of right now is getting back to her and pulling her out of the freezing rain. I’m her big sister, damnit. I’ll cut across the service track by the reserve, risking the mud, and then gun it up the main road. At this time the traffic would have cleared, and I can go twenty above the limit. I’m coming home, Bec.",

A message about a black skeleton and a mysterious white car. About an attack—pretty much in wide-eyed view of the public—on her own family.\n\nNow, I was pretty well enjoying myself at my house—trying out new hobbies (woodworking is harder than it sounds), enjoying my days to myself, but the real reason I became an exterminator in the first place was to help people. Protect them from the supernatural—what they should never have to worry about in the first place, I guess. \n\nI made some calls. Got the usual equipment back—they were happy for the help, short handed as they are nowadays. Always kept my truck: she’s been well maintained even since I turned in the exterminator’s coat. I did try and call a few friends, see if they couldn’t take care of this as a favor for an old friend, but they all had their hands full. Something about an uptick in supernatural activity—but that’s not really here nor there.\n\nI’m telling you this story because I’ve been thinking about the job as a whole recently—the secretive part of it. Why should we keep others in the dark about this? Do we have the right to dictate what ordinary citizens should or should not see?\n\nAnd then I saw a charcoal-black skeleton wield a man’s spine as a damned whip.\n\nThat pretty well solidified it in my mind—hopefully it should in yours, too. People deserve to know about this. They deserve to know that there are things out there that can ruin or endanger their lives. That can hurt them and their loved ones.\n\nAnd so I guess that was why I felt like I had to take this case on personally. Why I’m sitting here typing out this story, warning whomever might stumble upon it on this forum. I’m not the man who has the gall or the resources to take this story to a media outlet and get them to actually cover it—but I can do this much, at least. One last foray into the supernatural before I shut that chapter of my life for good.\n\nAnd that’s how I found myself taking another damn road trip up from the middle of nowhere, Louisiana. At least it’d be a familiar climate—Florida ain’t that much different, after all. We just have more gators.\n\nNow, that message I mentioned—Luna filled me in on the basics. Tall charred skeleton, attacked during the night, used a . . . damn grisly whip. The way it spoke on that tape—the security footage from that night, I mean—no doubt about it. Full-fucking Dullahan. I didn’t even know the things prowled in America. Clearly, they do, but, damn. Over a decade of this job and I’d never encountered one—or anything like it—before. \n\nThere’s only one weakness of theirs that I know of that a rube like me could pull off, which is gold. Pure as you can manage without ruining your savings, I suppose. Now, normally there’s a generic tool that we exterminators can use to rout out a specific kind of monster, or something to help injure them enough to send them packing for a while for someone more violently inclined to take care of, but that wasn’t going to be good enough for this fucker. Already a man-killer, and it clearly relished in that fact. No, some piddly gold knife wasn’t going to cut it—I needed something heftier. Something capable of smashing through those blackened bones, of snuffing out those eyes.\n\nOn an unrelated note, did you know it’s legal for a man to walk into an antique store and simply buy a mace? No identification needed or anything. It’s genuine, too, not even a flimsy replica. No clue if it was ever used or not, but it’s not like it mattered at the time. \n\nAfter that, it was just a quick stop at a pawn shop for all the gold chains they had on hand. Mostly just 14k, but they did have a real nice, gaudy bracelet of 22 karat gold. I don’t know why someone would ever want to wear something which weighed nearly a pound like that, but it was big enough to go around the head of a mace—a hammer could make that form fitting real, real quick. Pretty sure I could do some good damage to a regular person with it just like that, but a Dullahan is a lot more than a regular person with a detached head. I bought the cheap shit as a back up—you’ll hear more about that in a bit, I reckon.\n\nAfter that, there was just the drive over to the housing complex. Nice little place, too, if you could get over all the police tape. \n\nI’m retelling this pretty calmly, I reckon, and that’s because I already know it ends, but I was not nearly this relaxed when I got there. No, I was nearly as strung up as a fucking hog. I’d never let a client get hurt when I was working my jobs, not one, and part of me was just . . . well, pissed the hell off. It’s ridiculous to think that I could have stopped what happened in some sort of way—I didn’t even know about this subdivision before Luna contacted me—but that wasn’t what I was thinking about. I was thinking about the sheer gall of this monster. Attacking someone right outside of their house, dreamwhispering a sister out of her bed and nearly into its hands—taking out an innocent man because it fancied the shine of his spine, may he rest in peace.\n\nSo I’m afraid I may have been a bit curt with Luna and Dana. I apologize if either of you are reading this, if I hadn’t already done so in person.\n\nIt was Dana who met me as I was unloading everything out of the back of my truck. Her back had healed, but Luna was still having some issues with her throat. “Do you have a plan?” It was a cross between a nervous question and some sort of eagerness to get back at the Dullahan for what he’d done to them, I reckon.\n\n“Yep,” I said.\n\n“What is it?” I think I was just hearing the nervous, but I should have known better. Anyone would be angry after having that foul thing attack their sister—and certainly someone like Dana would.\n\n“Well, chiefly to dash its skull between a rock and a lump of gold. We’ll see how that pans out.”\n\nI think the message made it across, even through my gruffness, but I recognize now that we should have planned a bit more.\n\nEven after lugging all of those gold chains that far, I didn’t think far enough ahead about what I was going to do with them. I got as far as unlinking all of them from themselves, tying the six or so of them into a long rope of gold before the sun started to get too low on the horizon. \n\nI wasn’t sure when the monster would return; it’d need time to lick its own wounds after the thrashing that hound gave it, but I had to be ready for anything. Especially mystery cars rolling through locked gates like they weren’t there in the first place.\n\nI knew that we were in for a long night when the mist started to roll in. Magical or not, you could hardly see five feet in front of your own face, and the streetlights didn’t do anything except make it worse, a cone of solid white under all of them. It was quiet until about eleven that night, me and both of the sisters staking out the driveway. It was damn peaceful up until we heard the rumble of an engine rolling across the mist. Like a growl pitched even lower, coming from all around us. I was nearly sure we were being surrounded by something until the headlight shone straight towards us, piercing through the gloom straight into the living room.\n\nIt rolled up silently, aside from that bassy engine. Not even the gravel crunching.\n\nAnd then it stepped out of the cab.\n\nIt was like a dark wave of fear just *boiled* off the thing. The mist rolled and drifted away from it, like the water rejected it as much as my mind did. It was suffocating, even from inside, but I didn’t let that stop me. I was already out the door, mace in hand, thumbing the grip. I wasn’t quite sure if 22k would be pure enough, but they didn’t have 24 in the shop. Make the most of what you have, I guess.\n\nThe Dullahan had clearly been busy. Its “whip” was in one hand, the skeletal hand gripping it shaking with something like rage. The other hand was . . . fresh. It was unlike the rest, not yet darkened with  age. Still white—and I know it was brand spanking new, because the motherfucker hadn’t washed all of the gristle off of it.\n\nIt held its head in that hand, a stray drop of blood falling onto the stones beneath as the Dullahan raised its eyes to be level with mine.\n\n“Ah. An *exterminator*. I know your kind. I know how easily you die.”\n\nLike boulders gnashing against each other, smothered in black smoke. Just the sound of its set my teeth on edge, felt like my skin was being pressed against ice.\n\n“You undead bastard.” I was never good at shit talk, anyway.\n\n“I believe the last said something to that same effect. And then I led him to his death—he even made quite a nice replacement for the limb that creature relieved me of.”\n\nIf he was trying to get a rise out of me, well, I’ll be the first to admit: it worked. I took just a couple steps towards the monster when it reared the whip back, sent it cracking towards my face. I barely dodged it, more stumbling back out of the way as it whiffed just a inch above my head. By the time I was steady on my feet again, it was already snapping back towards my hand—the one holding the mace. \n\nI was able to pull it away, just barely, taking a few more paces towards the skeleton. If I wanted to do anything to it, I was gonna have to get within striking range. Maybe an oversight on my part whenever it could lift a man off his feet with scarcely a thought, but it was too late to think about that.\n\n“Passable,” it said, like this was some sort of fucking exam.\n\nThat was the first hit—the mace slammed against the forearm holding its grisly weapon. There was a crack of white light, the gold humming, almost singing as soon as it made contact with the charred skeleton. The Dullahan’s eyes flashed at that, a fracture appearing across one of the bones—the ulna.\n\n“You aren’t quite as stupid as the last.”\n\nI was still trying to size up the monster when it moved, dropping the whip as it lunged, just grabbing me by the throat as it brought that grinning skull up to my face. “Pitiful, still. An exterminator taking me on—all by himself? Foolish. It will be your end.”\n\nI got a taste of that supernatural strength, my feet leaving the ground as the Dullahan lifted me up. I was nothing to it. I had no leverage to swing at it properly—even pressing the gold against its arm, it did little more than sizzle and smoke at the contact. I was already struggling for breath. I would break before it did.\n\nThat icy feeling was only growing worse. It was like a glacier had me pressed into its grasp, the sensation of oily, black water constricting around my neck, tighter, and tighter, and yet tighter. There wasn’t even the room to gasp or splutter, there was just staring into those eyes. Those damned eyes. Like embers of a fire that should have been snuffed out long, long ago, looking to take my life to stoke the flames.\n\nI thought that was it.\n\nThen there was the clink of metal links.\n\nA sound like a screech, a loop of gold wrapping around the skeleton’s other hand, and the monster cursed as gold brushed against its cheek. It dropped me like a rock, and I was left panting for breath like a dog as its gaze switched over to the new attacker.\n\nI have to say—Dana is surprisingly good with just a link of chain. But I think I’ll let the sisters tell the rest of this story. They deserve it, after saving my ass. You can probably guess how it goes, what, with me sitting here telling you about it, but trust me, it’s better from the source.",

        "text": "The man woke up bound to a chair with a gag in his mouth. His head was pounding. He saw the room was dim with a plastic sheet on the floor underneath him, a bone saw laying on the ground, and plastic hanging around the walls. The man had no idea where he was; though he did have scattered memories of leaving work, getting into his car, and something hitting him from behind. Before the man could attempt to try escape from the chair another man walked into view and stood in front of him. Immediately the man started breathing hard through his nose.\n\nThe other man wore a plastic hospital gown over his clothes and medical gloves. The man recognised him as Warren; a guy both he and his girlfriend would see almost everytime when the man went to visit her at her apartment. They had both laughed about how Warren was always around, he had introduced himself to them and talked to them several times though he seemed normal and polite on the surface, there was something \"off\" about him. Warren's smile never reached his eyes and he would behave more like something trying to mimic a human rather than a regular person, which is why his girlfriend would call Warren 'The shifter' as an inside joke. Currently all the man felt was utter terror as he looked up at him. \n\n'Its okay. It's going to be over soon.' Warren said gently as if he was trying to comfort a child, then with a polite smile and an excited rise in his voice Warren told the man 'Now don't get me wrong, I don't think you are a bad person. I actually think you are great for *her* and that's the problem... I can't get you to leave and she's not going to leave you.' Warren paused to watch the man's reaction, the man's heart was racing faster as he was almost hyperventilating. Warren resumed his rant 'I know you barely know who I am and honestly you have never done anything to me, which is why I do want to apologise before I do this.' The man knew he was going to die. He tried to scream through the gag and shake out of the chair- anything to at least *try* get away. Warren smiled almost sadly as if he was attempting to express sympathy then continued talking as he moved closer to the man 'with you gone, I can get her to love me. Honestly your only flaw is you are in my way.' Warren took a plastic bag out of his back pocket and started unfolding it as he told the man 'I used to think there were two types of love: one to die for and one to live for, yet since meeting her, I've found a love to kill for' as he slipped the bag over the man's head.\n\n***********************************\n\nBe gentle this is my first fiction story and an attempt of an add-on to my r/TwoSentenceHorror.",

        "text": "   \nShe was always kind and bright to everyone she met. The warmth she radiated to those who came to her was as welcoming as the sun’s rays after a storm. However, it seemed too fake for me. I don’t know if it was because I’m a chronically cynical person, but her smile always seemed so… off. As if she was trying to hide something. But what could such a wonderful person be doing to warrant such an off putting smile? \n\n“Good morning, Ms. Valerie!” I shouted while watering my flowers. \n\nThe woman was in the middle of emptying out her car trunk when she responded back, “Good morning, Holly! It’s rare to see you out this early in the morning.”\n\nI’m not necessarily a morning person, so it was a strange occurrence for me to be out so early, but I had this dull urge in the back of my head to go outside for some reason. “I saw on the news yesterday that a heatwave will be hitting the area within a week, so I wanted to water my plants before it got too hot just in case. Would you like some help putting your groceries in your house?”\n\nThe smiling woman simply waved off my help. “It’s good, darling. I haven’t gotten too old that I can’t pick up a few bags of groceries,” she laughed as she closed her truck with a force that could chop a grown man’s fingers off. It almost made me jump if it wasn’t for her still looking in my direction. Every part of my body wanted to get out of this conversation that I, for some reason, started.\n\n“Well then, have a good day, and make sure you stay hydrated during the heatwave.”\n\n“I most definitely will, Holly. Thank you for your concern.”\n\nAs I watched the woman carry her bags of groceries into her house, I noticed how weirdly strong she was for a woman in her 40s. She carried 2 gallons of milk, a gallon of water, and 3 sacks of sugar as if she was carrying small trinkets. I couldn’t understand why, but I found later the reason why my body woke me up so early.\n\nTwo days have passed, and the heatwave was hitting hard. Kids couldn’t play outside without almost passing out. The water in the lake behind my house was emitting steam from being boiled by the sun. Even the air-conditioning was having such a hard time cooling the house down. \n\nIt was also during this time that people started going missing for some reason. Everyone was so focused on trying to combat the heat that no one realized that four people had gone missing until it was reported on the news. At first, the police officers just did a general search of the areas that these people lived in. Due to the heatwave, it was way too hot to do a search on foot because officers would end up fainting from heat exhaustion.\n\nDuring the search, the officers also took the time to ask neighbors if they had seen the missing people. One of the people that went missing was from my neighborhood, so the officers ended up coming to my house as well. They provided a case of water bottles which I greedily accepted, and started to question me about the person who went missing. I didn’t really know the person, so I couldn’t give much information. The officers thanked me for my time then proceeded to *that* woman’s house.\n\nI actually haven’t seen her these past couple of days since I holed myself up inside my house, but seeing her unsettling smile again as she greeted the officers shot shivers down my spine. The officers didn’t spend too much time at her house either and began to walk away when, suddenly, another police car zoomed over to where the officers were and beckoned them into the car immediately.\n\nThe officers immediately ran and jumped into the car, but as they did, I noticed that the woman never dropped her smile. It just became… creepier. Nothing about her face changed. It was the way she stood there and watched the police car… smiling… without going back inside her house. Almost like how someone continues to smile after enduring a conversation they were forced to listen to just in case the person turns back around after walking away. But the way she was handling herself just made it so uncomfortable to look at.\n\nI was about to go back into my house before that woman caught me staring when, simultaneously, the officers dashed out of the police car and barged into the woman’s house. One of the officers handcuffed the woman, still smiling, and dragged her to the police car. The loud noise caught the attention of the neighbors who are now coming out of their houses to see what was going on.\n\nI can still vividly remember the words that woman said just as she was being shoved into the police car.\n\n“Nosey people should just worry about themselves.”\n\nShe was staring directly at me as she said those words. As if it was a better-late-than-never warning. Just as the police car door closed, the officers began to file out of the house with the four missing people plus five other people who were reported missing over the course of three years. \n\nAll of them were in the same conditions:\n\n* Food poisoned by spoiled milk\n* Clothes drenched in water\n* Caramelized sugar hardened over their mouths with only a small hole for a straw to fit through\n* Random cut marks over their bodies\n\n“It’s been nine years since that day. If I had never seen her that morning with her groceries, I would have never believed that it was her doing. After that day, I continued to mind my own business like I always do, but I could never smile again. Every time I smiled, it would remind me of that woman’s smile.”\n\n“Is that why you secluded yourself in your home, Ms. Holly? So that you wouldn’t have to smile at anything?”\n\nI glance up at the therapist who sits across from me, calmly waiting for an answer. “I seclude myself in my home so that I don’t go running my nose in other people’s business. Although my life is shitty, I still want to live, so I would rather not cut it short.”\n\nThe therapist's phone rings, so she excuses herself to answer it. It wasn’t a long phone call, but it was one that abruptly stopped our session.\n\n“I’m sorry, Ms. Holly, but we will have to end our session here.”\n\n“It’s not a problem. There’s still next week.”\n\nI say my goodbyes and leave the office. As I left the building and headed over to my car, I couldn’t help but smirk to myself before going home.",

        "text": "“Music, that is the incarnation of the collective human soul; I am no harbor of this, I should not profit from the absolute joy one feels throughout the intense emotional presence of music itself. I am simply its vessel, for it is poured into me and trickles down my fingers; I am a boat on the sea of tunes and screams, for I do not own the melody that torpedoes onto instrument after instrument.” - Phua Sheen.\n\nAt some point during this, I should’ve self reflected, I know. It's late, much too deep to have a large self intervention of this sort. \n\nBut… I can’t help it. I can’t help but wonder what the point of it all was.\n\nIt was all a mischievous ploy, the largest scam I’ve ever partaken in, though many had my name under sheets, never to be seen. \n\nI’m only writing this because of the overwhelming guilt that has backed itself onto my shoulders, forcing me to rip muscle and tear sockets. I am not writing this to save others from what I’ve done, if that is even a feasible option for any else at this point.\n\nI am a selfish man.\n\nI won’t deny that, especially not after the years of my life in which I destroyed everything. I am selfish; I am greedy; I am self-absorbed; and I long for something: a role model.\n\nOnly now do I realize that.\n\nI’ll hush my heart for now and spill the actual meat and beans of the truth to you: My name is Ember Sheen. You have never heard of me and most likely never will again, if this even reaches the web. I used to belong to a group, one you’ve at no time caught a whiff of, because it makes sure you don’t and never will.\n\nI am the exception.\n\nThis knowledge, it is forbidden; This tale, it is forsaken.\n\nYou all might wake up with massive headaches and fall ill, dying within the day.\n\nOr they’ll pass this off as nothing, another story with no aim, simply fiction.\n\nThe first day I was introduced was one of wonder: I sat, lonesome, at a party on some unwritten island, one that the average go-rounder couldn’t point out on a map. I was the product of a douche, said bastard would’ve been at this party.\n\nI was my father, at least in that room. People had no idea. I looked just like him, save for the younger features; and none of them kept up with one another.\n\nThey were all junkies for everything in the book, no doubt, and they only talked in these spaces, high and horny.\n\nAt the time, I was what some would call a hobo, no real purpose in life. School only failed me, mainly because I couldn’t keep my mind on the work. I’d have other things pinned as more important: my social status, which under no pretense reached the heights I wished it to.\n\nMy home life was a pile of rotting garbage, to keep the least of it under the rug.\n\nSo… There I sat: A party in which I knew no one, a party that I had an executive ticket to, being flown out, pretending to be the man who never raised me.\n\nI wondered how he sat. Should I have a masculine stance or was he more of a feminine man?  \n Did he drink? Or did he just snort the mix of who-knows-what straight into his nose?\n\nI worried for an hour before someone approached. “Theo,” she began, sitting next to me. She was, to be quaint, your average fanatic, of what I didn’t know yet; Be it something mainstream, like crack, or an off the books, mind-altering pill. \n\nShe, also, had the curves of a Goddess.\n\n“You okay?” She quizzed me, leaning on my shoulder. I had come to realize my father must’ve been close with this woman.\n\nHow many times was I almost created with her rather than my own mother?  \n “I’m fine,” I said solemnly, trying not to make too much of my own personality imprint onto my words.\n\nShe leaned up, staring me in the eyes. “Something’s different about you, Theo.”  \n Sweat built on my forehead.\n\n“Are you… turning civ?”  \n I didn’t even know the meaning of her words, but the tone of her voice let it be known that whatever she spoke of was a sin in her book. \n\n“No,” I answered quickly, perhaps a bit too quick. “Just…” God, I was panicking, trying to come up with any excuse. “Thinking.”  \n She laid back down. My heart beat a tad slower. “Don’t think too much. We’re all shitty. It's a human virtue.”  \n I slowly began to feel more comfortable with her. \n\nAnd in this role… This role as my dead-beat father.\n\n“I abandoned them,” I said steadily after moments without speaking to the beautiful junkie.\n\nShe sighed. “I have left some behind me, too.”  \n “My son, he’s out there somewhere, without me,” I was pretending to be him and it was making me sick to my stomach, but healing something within.\n\nI needed this closure, this false reality in which he thought and cared for me.\n\n“My family wonders where I’ve been, what I’m doing. They think I’m dead, which I might as well be,” she retorted.\n\n“Why’d you leave?” I quizzed.\n\n“It was…” She grunted. “I don’t wanna get into that, Theo.”  \n I nodded. “That’s okay. I understand.”  \n “You seem nicer.”  \n I coughed. “Maybe it's the regret.”\n\nShe looked into my eyes. “I’m dating someone now. Someone I met at one of these.”  \n My heart tripped into my gut, for I knew this was the worst place to meet someone. Her life: This young, gorgeous girl was ruining her life for the hell of it.\n\n“I wanna feel normal again, I think.” I let her speak instead of interrupting, it was better that way. “But I’ll never be back there, as a civ. I’ve felt too many things here. I’ve had one too many rushes. I’ve heard one too many secrets.”  \n I felt tears knocking on my eyes, but I told them off, for it wasn’t a good time.\n\n“Do you wanna meet him?” She asked me.\n\nI began to shake from indecision. Do I go further with this? Do I walk completely into the role as my father?  \n “I can meet him,” I ended up saying. Why?\n\nBecause I had nothing else. This was giving me purpose.\n\nShe was silent for ten minutes, her eyes closed. I figured she had fallen asleep.\n\n“He’s an asshole,” she spoke, “but I think he’s the best I’ll get.”  \n No reply came from me.\n\n“He wants to run for office soon,” the woman continued.  \n I put a sorrowful hand on her head, stroking her hair. I don’t think she had anyone, either. I think she was in my same position, yet so much worse. She’d be me in the future if I kept attending these parties. Addicted to so many substances you can’t stop; In a hole that only gets larger with each passing day; Having to settle for the worst due to the insight you obtained unwillingly. \n\n“I’m sorry,” I whispered to her.\n\nThings went on like that for another hour, ending with her trying to please me, but the sadness was too much for me. I couldn’t get it up.\n\n“I have never even thought about a life in which I don’t live this way. This is my passion, my truth. I can eat the scraps of nutrients for it; I can drink the rejected water in turn for this. To be honest, the where and how and when do not matter for me: I could eat tomorrow or tonight; I could drink in a week or today. My craft is over all Earthly desire, you see?” - Phua Sheen.\n\nI ended up attending another one of the outings, this time with her beloved coming, too. We had planned it awkwardly that previous night, after events that I don’t care to recall took place. \n\nOn the way to said celebration, I wondered. Someone with infinite money, spending it like a paper-dollars in a board game, bought me and everyone else another ticket, looping us around the world onto another continent, another property, another home.\n\nOne they owned.\n\nAs the private jet flew me in stride, I pondered my limited awareness of who that could’ve been, and how you get that position. How do you get atop the world? How do you spend money as if you have no care for it? Is it a billionaire? A famous one?  \n That is the conclusion I landed on, as no other answer made sense to me. \n\nThe jet landed and I came out from within, thanking the driver with a wave, and jogged into the building, finding people standing all about everywhere.\n\nI tumbled around for a moment before seeing her, that alluring fiend. Walking over, she noticed me, choking on her drink for a sliver of a moment. \n\n“Theo!” She barked. “Meet Braydon.” I came to be shaking hands with a man who I thought looked to be a vampire. The sides of his head were shaved, leaving speckles of hair in a stubble manner, with the top slicked back; He wore a black vest with yellow accents and fancy shoes, ones that had been polished within the hour. \n\nHe didn’t speak, just bowed his head.   \n Eventually, after a clenching of palms that was too lengthy, he asked me a query: “How’d you meet Amy?” His voice wasn’t friendly, but it wasn’t hostile. \n\nIt seemed like he was waiting for something. A sign maybe.\n\nLost in thought, it took thirty seconds before she, Amy, took the lead for me: “We met at the slums many years ago,” she laughed. “He was only there to pick someone up, I enticed him, and here we end up.”  \n That backstory was for my father and Amy? It sounded like a summed up love story.\n\nBut me and her had dialogue like we had barely ever talked.\n\nWas this a lie for him, this man? Was she trying to make him jealous? Or was it in a different context? Did my father pick up women and ruin their lives, bringing them here?\n\nIs that what he did instead of buying me toys and eating dinner with me?  \n “Sounds interesting,” he replied, his voice deeper than I knew one could be, like coals on a flame. “She told me about you last night,” he said confidently. “Said she wanted me to meet you. You must be close?” He smiled, as if he knew we weren’t.\n\n“Yeah,” I replied, fixing the collar of my shirt. “We’re close.” \n\nThe sounds of the people around us suddenly got louder, intensifying the aura.\n\nHe smacked her on the bottom. “Go get me and,” he nodded at me, “a drink, would you?”\n\nShe looked nervous, blinking at me with scared eyes. \n\nAmy scuttled off into the distance to gather beverages, after.\n\nHe then had me alone, just me and him to speak, the people around us only adding ear-aching background noise.\n\n“Something about you.” He broke our silence.\n\n“Hm?” I moaned in confusion.\n\n“You have more potential than this. You aren’t even supposed to be here.”  \n My heart sunk deeper than into my gut, it was already ash at the bricks of a fireplace. “What?”   \n “You aren’t one of these people, Theo,” he knew. “You're something different. A watcher. You come here to watch. To figure things out.”  \n What had I gotten myself into?\n\n“No,” I said in alarm.\n\n“I’m not gonna hurt you,” he assured, placing his hand on my shoulder. “Kid, do you have a job? A family?”  \n The answer was displayed on my face.\n\n“I can help you,” he swiftly asserted. \n\nNo response left my lips.\n\n“You can be someone you’ve never thought to be, someone unknown, yet flourishing in celebrations grander than this shit.” \n\nI was confused, but intrigued.\n\nHe grinned. “You won’t even have to cut the act, Theo.”\n\nSo many emotions flew through me, I wanted to vomit and not wake up after a cleansing slumber. \n\nThen the answer to a question I had prior came to light: This was who commenced these outings, someone nameless to the public.\n\nThey had no one's standards to care for, so they did what they pleased; No one knew of them, so nothing could harm them; And, with their unlimited funds, no one cared to mess with them, anyhow, for a good bribe no one can pass.\n\nHe looked at me with an understanding that I now got him, what he was. “Here,” he reached into his vest pocket, slashing out a card, a pristinely printed namesake giver. “Take this, kid, and let me help you.”  \n I was Amy and he was my father.\n\nI was being pulled out from the slums into something astrologically more glorious. \n\nI took his card and drank with him and Amy, not saying too much, thinking all the while.\n\n“I’ve walked this path for almost the entirety of my runtime. Soon, I’ll be on the last thread of years here. This body will float away into the Earth, becoming a part of the next bustling life it needs to; I do not claim to be anyone, anything, for I am just a creature haphazardly making my way through events. And, knowing my futileness, the moon gazes at me after each passing of the sun, and I tell it to give my message to the rest of beings, but it ignores me.” - Phua Sheen.\n\nI didn’t go to another one of these events for what felt like an era, even though invites arrived in my inbox. For a while, I let the average cyclical nature of my daily living return to me. \n\nI ran my fingers across it all, mentally making my decision all along. \n\nI lived in an absolute dump, a barnacle on the back of an industrial facility. The only reason this rural place even existed was to fund the factory nearby, of which almost everyone around worked for.\n\nMy mother, too, lived here, living and breathing in the basement of our rotting apartment. \n\nShe almost never left the underground domicile, and when she did, she was only gone for bare moments, escaping to the grocery store by-weekly to purchase her minimum of gatherings. \n\nWe hadn’t had a conversation in weeks, for she didn’t need me until she ran out of money. \n\nMy cash influx came from the government. Eventually, they had fallen to pity me and my lack of being able to get a job or move from those stranded woodlands; So, for that time being, I lived off government aid in the form of unemployment, indefinitely.\n\nI had no plans on where to move or even how to begin; I had no idea where to go.\n\nAfter a week of being back home, I picked up that somehow still immaculate card from Braydon. I dialed the number on it with ever so hesitant fingers, the resounding ringing only flying out every few seconds.\n\nI thought of every possible root for my life from here, most ending in a depressive suicide.\n\nThis one, though, the one in which I call up this man, had no known conclusion in my head. It was a completely unseen avenue and, in knowing my other choices, I chose it.\n\nNothing else was comparable.\n\nSoon, his assistant grabbed the call, telling me when and where to meet, and gave me a flight ticket to get there.\n\nThe anticipation swelled in my heart. The next couple of days in wait consisted of me loathing myself in bed.\n\nI left money at my mothers door, and went on my way, after all had passed.\n\nKnowing her, my leaving wouldn’t be a nick in her skin, she’d preach her mantra about how all are free, and not a wonder of me would ever reappear in her mind.\n\nI arrived at the manner of someone unknown hours later, deep within the snow of a country I didn’t even care to read the name of before boarding. My cheap sneakers crunched into the snow below me, mashing every particle, and a chill smacked into my soles.\n\nTrudging up to the door, I watched the sun set off in the distance, a gloomy orange blow-out.\n\n*Knock*. *Knock*.\n\nThe gateway came to an open with a dramatic pull. I came face to face with the man who offered to save my life.\n\n“Ah, Ember, I see you’ve made it.”  \n I nodded. “I’m open to whatever you have for me,” I said with a drawn out open of my arms.\n\nHe smiled, an insidious mark of a predator. My hands began to shake, from the cold or his eyes, I do not know. \n\n“Come inside,” he ordered, revealing the blood and guts of this home. \n\nIt was, ironically, a very vampiric house, if that makes any sense; Chandeliers could be spotted above an extensive spiral staircase, coated in a gloomy black paint with steps lined with velvet cloth.\n\nI entered, and the frigid air was shut out.\n\n“You like the place?” He questioned me as he rubbed his hands together, blowing heat from his mouth into them.\n\n“It’s cozy,” I replied after consideration. Though, in contrast, the place was doused in areas with Godless shadows, streamlined spiderwebs, and, overall, a sense of awful fright.\n\nSomething abhorrent had taken place here, I thought, or still does. \n\nHe came up at my back swifter than I thought he could move, his hand landing on my shoulder, guiding me towards the steps. “I want you to meet the boss, friend. He can, eh, approve of you,” he told me. The last part sounded mischievous. \n\nWhat kind of tests would they perform on me?  \n “What traits is he looking for?” I asked the man.\n\nI felt like I heard a chuckle, but it was gone before I could confirm. “You’ll absorb all you need when you meet him.”  \n The steps were long and anxiety inducing, making a clambering echo each time my foot hit one. \n\nWe both said nothing as our journey was leading us up.\n\nWhen we reached the top, he went ahead of me, lending me his hand for the last step. On this top floor, there was only one room, a hallway leading to it. The door was encased in what looked to be a spice, covering the door frame and the floor around it.\n\n“Please,” he begged, “step over the protection.” \n\nI assumed he meant the unknown specs scattered around, and I didn’t mean to mess with them, anyhow. He walked in before me, leaving the door ajar, and I jumped in behind him.\n\nThe air was different in this room; Everything was. It was akin to swapping worlds, for the background sound was a low hum, scratching at my brain; and the air was hotter, like I’d entered a sauna; and the interior was odd, like that of a cabin, including a fireplace, which burned on, and a comically large small table, able to house only three people.\n\nHe sat down.\n\nI followed, sitting across from him. \n\nOnly one more seat awaited a joiner, the one at the front.\n\n“Who else is coming?” I implored.\n\nBraydon’s joy came back in full effect, yet no answer laced my ears. \n\nWith no warning or reasoning, a deceased deer, one with its antlers gruesomely carved off from its head, swung down onto the table with a meaty plop. I jumped back in my seat, causing a jarring screech.\n\nAnother chuckle roared from him.\n\nAnd, on queue with my rapidly advancing aversion to this ordeal, the fire from the fireplace began to take the shape of something impossible. The flames licked the bricks surrounding them, eventually taking on semi-solid forms, pulling out from within its containment. \n\nWhen they escaped, it looked to have grown into a molten man, burning the floor underneath him with whipping balls of smoke floating away.\n\nThe lava began to harden, cracking and falling, and I was met with an unclothed, cardinal male. His shading seemed to be in a full ebony rather than a normal humans darker hues, and his skin was crackled, charred, and dry; The features of his face were unnervingly sharp: his nose was a point more marvelous than a hunter's blade, his chin was a sloping triangle, ready for stabbing, and his cheek-bones and eyebrows were extended and sandpapered until perfection.\n\nAs he got closer, I took in the two deer horns on his head, an opposite to the rest of him.\n\nThe situation was obvious to me now: a sacrifice had been made and, in turn, this stereotypical devil had been called to play.\n\nIn my seat, I felt my own piss dampen my legs and pants.\n\nHe walked forwards, clutching the last seat and entering it stiffly.\n\n“You wish of me to approve of this peasant? He has not for the guts; He has soiled himself within seconds of grazing my appearance,” the gruff devil responded. His voice was that of mysterious origin, not physically possible according to my standards.\n\nBraydon adjusted his comfortable sitting position. “The boy has potential.”\n\nI felt Satan’s eyes land upon me, sucking me of information. “Lowlife. You bring me a bum. A fucking beggar wretch!” He lashed out in anger, crumbling his end of the table in a fatal slash of hatred.\n\n“Listen!” Braydon screamed back. “He is more than you can feel!”\n\n“Is he?” The beast shrieked, a groundbreaking huff in his tone. “I’ll put him through the trial, but you are wrong, damn infidel, and you will wreak urine endlessly if you continue to bring me bastards.”  \n My vision had gone blurry. I felt myself fading from here and, looking down at my fingers, they had begun to dissipate.\n\nIn the spur of a moment, the reality around me changed. I then was captured in what looked to be the interior of a chest drawer, a latch miles above my head.\n\nSlowly, with the thundering of vast storms, it came loose, and was opened by a creature bigger than my comprehension, looking at it made my brain crunch like a stressed, sopping towel.\n\nA boom and a reverberation stronger than an Earth-quake hit me, the chest’s lid dropped to a close.\n\nSomething else stood in that room with me.\n\nGandering up, I saw what was thought to be a lanky cryptid, its bones obvious under sagging skin as its eye bags were larger than rivers themselves; a horrifying caricature of bodily decay. \n\nIt was just a human, though, one tortured to its end, forced to move about in a body not fit for living. \n\nAs it slithered to me, a voice no longer apt to speak spat out from its throat: “You,” the full word took endless seconds to push out for the poor creature, “are a worse sinner than I.”\n\nOut from its back, it snatched its own spine, toppling over but still functioning. Its spine was lengthier than it ever should’ve been.\n\nIt pulled back and, at quantum speeds, whipped its spine at me, cracking into my skin and leaving bloody blisters. I howled out in pain and fell to the floor.\n\nI was cemented in my position, the agony only rising, and time became faster, noticeably. I felt the wound heal in real time, but my hunger and thirst grow, my longing for sleep begging for attention. Soon, it began to whip me again, faster than my eyes could perceive.\n\nI endured the passionate anguish of infinite damage and unkempt bodily functions.\n\nI survived longer than I ever should have in that state.\n\nA week in the chest felt like years.\n\nWhen it ended, I was surprised to feel no lesions in my skin, no cuts in my muscles. I looked up from where I sat, Satan and Braydon staring me down.\n\nI was in shock.\n\nThe words coming out from their mouths didn’t even register with me until minutes later, when I finally got used to the painless continuance.\n\n“-it seems so,” I caught wind of Braydon saying.\n\n“Why?” I managed to yelp.\n\nThe blood-red man chortled. “The endorsement of this job was not a walk through daisy fields, boy, yet… You survived.” His sharpened fingers tapped the table.\n\nI was still coming to; Trying to get the last week washed from my brain.\n\n“Shall we get through the approval?” Braydon prompted.\n\nIt was then I noticed that everything was the same as it was before I left.\n\nNo time had passed, contrary to my reasoning that it wasn’t possible for that to be the case.\n\nSatan sighed. “Yes, I’ll let the man pass, but mark my words, Braydon, you bring me any more of these Jesus-esque pansies, and I will give you a year in your personal, awaiting end.”\n\nWith that, the devil vanished into a smoke, billowing into the air.\n\n“Hell?” I uttered.\n\nHe nodded.\n\nI vomited onto the table. \n\n“Now,” he began, disregarding my slop across the deer's decaying body, “I’d like to welcome you to the board. We are humanity's true fate dictators, this government's real leaders, you understand?”\n\nIf it weren’t right then, I would’ve had a million questions.\n\n“Executive decision makers,” he continued. “The fate of all in our hands for the small price of a stay in the underworld.”\n\nI had nothing to answer him with.\n\n“Your opinion over all else,” he remarked. “Right,” he said, getting off his power-trip, “we’ll ship you to Washington, give you an apartment at the top of some skyscraper, let you file the paperwork for your chosen choice-makes, and leave you with Lucifer’s contact information, any questions?”\n\nI didn’t respond.\n\n“No one *knew* that the beloved American government had swooped directly into Pakistan with a team of disheveled Navy Seals; The pakistanian’s highest officials didn’t catch word of it until America decided to reveal that a pair of bullets were lodged into Osama Bin Laden. We have no true idea of what all they do that we have not caught word of yet, and perhaps never will. All I say is that I live a lifestyle that this untelling government would disapprove of, and I find that more worthy than any cut of meat.” - Phua Sheen.\n\nI found myself in the heart of the states, high up in the clouds. I began immediately on making grand-scale decisions that affected *everyone*, even if they knew they were made or not.\n\nThe government would puppet what I told them. I’d see it on the news: The action of my wants being played out in real time under false pretenses.\n\nIt was exhilarating and addicting.\n\nIt was also my preferred facet for pushing back the memories of that chest. In full clarity, what I needed then was therapy, but who would believe a man living on the brink of his dead father’s name with a bank-account of a billionaire.\n\nThat was a big plus, too. I bought anything you can imagine, since money was nothing but a number for me, that number being infinity. \n\nClothes, toys, cars, houses, land, deals, businesses- I went down the paths like a rapid fire machine gun, anything to suppress the images of that hell, but each path was moral to my own standards, and legal.\n\nIt was like this for me for months, though they passed like seconds. I was the man behind the scapegoat thousands of times before the hell-bound man contacted me.\n\nIt was in the middle of cleaning up the governmental drug works when the ding on my computer distracted me, making me leave the in’s and out’s of removing hard narcotics from uncared for cities. \n\nI clicked it, revealing a lottery-esque checklist sent directly to me from Satan.\n\nIf I went through with making each policy and change to our society he wished to see, he’d award me with HP- or heaven points.\n\nBy going through with what he wanted, I would be guaranteed a spot in the bright, comfortable home of paradise rather than that chest.\n\nRather than the underworld; Than hell.\n\nThe first thing on the list was dastardly: “Go about creating the first instances of a government beginning to accept pedophilic stimuli as a form of regulated therapy.”  \n I wanted to jump from the top of my new home, but… I knew what awaited me if I went through with doing so.\n\nI knew what awaited me if these actions weren’t followed through with.\n\nEverything I’d done, I’d made sure it was morally correct, bettering the world through my past suffering.\n\nBut this… This would undo all of my efforts; This was the start to my downfall.\n\nThe truth of the matter was that I could never see that place again, that chest, no matter how much I wanted the world to be a safer place.\n\nI started to accept that I’d be the one to sin, worse than anyone before me, yet still cheat my way into a good ending. \n\nThat night, I watched the news: “Oregon is trying to pass a bill that will begin showing artificial-intelligence generated, lewd children photos as a form of therapy for pedophiles or, now called, ‘disorder-enslaved patients,’ according to Oregon’s medical professionals.” I was glad to see that the world was denoting the disgusting acts as what they were, but disheartened at the same time.\n\nThis had to happen for my admission.\n\nI worked day and night, forcing individuals to do my bidding and create false studies and statistics about this.\n\nI cried while writing them up; I turned toward harming myself in turn for my actions. Nothing helped except the knowledge that if I continue with this checklist, I’d be free from an eternity in the locked chest.\n\nBy the end of a six-month period, I’d done it, despite the efforts of thousands, and I had locked in place the start to my heaven points.\n\n“Our society, it turns dark. Everywhere I turn there seems to be something lurking, something of an unfavorable taste, be it from another snide individual or the decisions of the ones who rule us over. I do not care to see the end of this story. Now, at the very click of nightfall, I tell the moon to smack us off our directory around the sun, but it ignores me.” - Phua Sheen.\n\nI woke up in my bed, of which was larger than life. I pushed myself over, seeing a woman slumbering in nothing but under garments. I rose, exiting the covers, and stepped onto a condom, the wet slobber of it gracing my sole.\n\nI jogged into the bathroom, as I passed her, I saw money tucked into her bra, hundreds of bills.\n\nThe light came on immediately, revealing me. I scoffed in anger, my hands turning to fists upon seeing myself. My arm swung the mirror aside, cramming my fingers into the drawer behind it to gather a treat.\n\nI snorted it off the counter.\n\nAfterwards, I came back into my bedroom, ripping the covers off from the woman in my bed. “Leave,” I told her simply and adamantly. She shot up, covering herself before gathering her clothing and running out.\n\nMy bum hit my chair with my body flopping down aggressively. My computer came to life, my eyes meeting several notifications from each business I owned, some of which containing the information on a plethora of deceptive deals.\n\nI ignored them for now, clicking onto my checklist, prepared to rot my day into the ground. \n\nI was on the last stand of these tasks. I had completed two-thousand of them within a six year time period. \n\nThe years passed like weeks. It was as if I had aged a million years in six weeks.\n\nI was so different than I used to be. \n\nScars from fights on my knuckles, the evidence of intoxicants on my breath and in my nose, the list of heinous acts committed under my name- the lists were infinite in category and length. The sorrow of my actions lessened as time went on and they came to feel unreal to me, like video game objectives.\n\nIn saying that, I formulated an email at the time: “Hello, Smith. I’d like you to have a chat with the founder of CompXETra.”  \n I ordered hits on men from the comfort of my home on a bi-weekly basis, using people like chess pieces in order to build up my underground empire. \n\nMy last stand against the sanctity of heaven was likely the worst: “Kill fifty-million humans.” \n\nI’d started diseases, viruses, wars, trafficking, hate groups, new addictants, genetically modified insects, assassins guilds, mass food poisoning, water tampering- everything in the book, yet the check mark never came, as my number hadn’t been met.\n\nI had no idea how. I’d done everything in the book.\n\nExcept for one thing, I finally thought, stumbling into it accidentally. \n\nThe wars I began were simple proxy wars, nothing special.   \n I raced to my computer, typing up document after document depicting how the next year of the world would play through. \n\nI watched it from afar.\n\nThe start of conflict between us and China, before it ended in a double nuking. Part of southern America had been blotted off the map, the areas around it deemed unlivable.\n\nA majority of China had been smeared, a tear on every map.\n\nThe infrastructure of society had been shaken, tinier wars within countries flew at rapid speeds.\n\nDuring all this, I watched my endmost check mark tick, and awaited my death to come.\n\nIt was then that I knew what I really was, what Satan had used me as.\n\nI was the anti-Christ, even if I had no idea.\n\nI brought about wrath, and eventually the end.\n\nIt was when this came to mind and began to cement that I contacted the devil once more.\n\nI asked him if any of it was true, any of his promises of the heaven I’d see, or if he’d lied to me on an astronomical level.\n\nThe only response I got back before my ultimate fate marched up to my door in the form of vengeful, vexed Chinese soldiers, the one ending I still ignore as I note this: “The devil went down to the recluse snows of Greenland, searching for a soul to take in stride; Instead he found a fiddle, and he played it until the dawn of tribulation.”",

        "text": "     No one believes me. I’m not sure that I even believe me because it sounds insane, impossible, not a shred of believability. That’s what my dad said, “not a shred of believability. You’re too old to be telling stories Samantha.” He said it with that look he’s always giving me; a look that says I can do better, be better and what I always think he wants to say, “Don’t end up like your mother.” \n    Before I get too ahead of myself, let me explain. My name is Samantha Williams, I’m fourteen years old, I live on 742 Opal Lane, Newark, Nevada and I’m disappearing. It started months ago, as much as I didn’t want to believe it myself or to tell someone and be seen as crazy. I hate that word, ‘crazy.’ It’s what they called my mom before she disappeared. No one believed her when she told them that her shadow was being torn to pieces, that she was losing parts of herself, both physically and mentally.\n    It started small, a slight loss of hearing in her left ear, forgetting things like where she left her keys or why she had walked into a room. Nothing unusual, but it progressed. Soon she was completely deaf in her left ear and losing hearing in her right, she would forget what you were talking about mid conversation. One day she woke up and she couldn’t use her right arm. It just hung there, she claimed she couldn’t feel it at all. As if it was no longer a part of her. It didn’t stop there though, in a span of months she had lost feeling in both of her legs. The doctors were clueless. Nothing could explain all of her symptoms and eventually, when she told them about her shadow, showed my dad her paintings, they decided it was a mental issue.\n    I remember seeing the paintings for the first time. A couple of months before my mom disappeared, years before I would start experiencing the same symptoms. They were in my mom’s studio, an extra room she did all of her painting in. I had never seen it before that night, nor had my dad, it was my mom’s workspace and she hated to share her art before it was completed. But I hid around the corner when I heard them arguing.\n     My mom was gesturing wildly at a series of paintings, yelling at my dad, “Do you see Mark?! Do you see what’s happening?! It’s my shadow, something is taking parts of my shadow and with that they are taking parts of me.”\n     My dad looked defeated, begging her to stop, “There is nothing wrong with your shadow Marjorie! These paintings mean nothing! You're imagining this, your brain is trying to find a way to cope with your symptoms. Please Marjorie, let me help you.” \n     It went on like that for what seemed like hours but was likely only minutes. I went to bed before I was caught and snuck back to the room early in the morning. My mom had become so forgetful and my dad so angry, they hadn’t locked the door. I saw the paintings. \n    They were terrifying, especially to a child of ten. My mother, the ever-so-talented artist, had painted a series of images of herself and her shadow. It started with a painting of a younger version of her, a version I had only ever seen in photographs from her college days. She was smiling and happy and her shadow was whole. The paintings progressed though, she grew older in each and her shadow slowly started to lose pieces that she represented in jagged marks. First a jagged hole that would be her left ear, then her right arm slowly disappeared, her legs, all of the things she claimed she couldn’t feel. Even parts of her head were marked in jagged holes. In her latest work with the paint still wet, her shadow was nearly gone. \n     My mom disappeared before she could finish any other paintings and my dad withdrew after that. He wouldn’t talk about her or what happened, as if the hours spent in hospitals, then in search teams looking for her had never happened, but now it was my turn. I noticed it a few weeks ago, my shadow was tearing at the edges of my left foot. I had never been clumsy before that change. I was on the soccer team, ran track and field, played basketball and softball; my friends joked I had a sport for every season and I did. If it weren’t for that I may not have noticed the changes, caught it so early on. I know my dad can’t save me, but maybe I can save myself. I won’t end up like my mom, completely gone without a trace. I’m going to start researching. I’m going to figure this out. Wish me luck, I guess.\n    I heaved a deep sigh as I closed the document, careful not to smudge any of my meticulous notes. The copies of the blog post had landed on my desk just that morning, along with the extensive lists for her mother, one Marjorie Williams nee Benton. Hospital visits, newspaper articles about her disappearance, photos of her paintings, everything about their lives. The articles were vague of course, no suggestions of something supernatural and the girl, Samantha, had been careful to block out her personal information, even on her private online journal, but it was a simple fix for the research rats at the company. It was their job afterall to find anything needing a further look, perhaps even a team sent out. \n    The decision to send out a team was where I came in to play. The research rats would diligently document any mysterious disappearances, deaths, unusual activities, etc. Then I would take all of that information and send out the appropriate teams when necessary. Ghost hunters for hauntings, cryptid hunters for anything of that variety, or in this case, a generational curse. My notes did say that the girl and her mother had both been the first born females in many generations. Likely a simple fix then. I sent the appropriate paperwork to the team and wished the girl luck, perhaps it would be on her side. The case was caught early on afterall.",

        "text": " \n\nI stumbled across this on 4chan just know that OP refers to the original poster not me i'm trying to recreate the conversation I found\n\nOP:When I was a kid there was this show with an animal resembling a weasel dressed as a pirate and he and his crew would go on adventures. First of all, no I do not remember which program or channel had it. I will ask some of my friends and my brother to see what they remember. I just remember the pirate weasel and his first mate, a crocodile dressed as a pirate along with other characters I don't quite remember. \n\nONE DAY LATER\n\nDrake234:I believe I am aware of what you are referring to and the weasels name was Wilbert but they called him willy throughout the show and the crocodile was named Carl I think there was also a cat named Katrina and a dog named Dan and these two characters often fought and willy would step in and stop them. I think there was also a villain. I don't remember his name but he was a bat and he had a helper who I think was a rabbit and he was often mean to the rabbit. Willy always said he would never forgive the bat for what he did and I don’t know if we ever found out or if it was revealed in one of the episodes I missed. But yeah that’s all I know. \n\nOP:Oh yeah I remember the bat now he was creepy and I don't remember an explanation of why willy hates the bat either although i did miss some episodes and my memory sucks at times. I will be talking to one of my childhood friends in about an hour. Whenever he arrives I will try to ask him about the show and see what he knows.\n\nOP:I just talked to my friend and he said that he can’t believe I don’t remember more about the show. He said that the show got so big that they did an event in our home town where you would drop your kids off and they would do all sorts of stuff with them so that they could interact with the characters it was a lot of fun now that I think about it I can’t believe that I forgot about it however, my friend got a little uncomfortable when he was talking about it so I pressed him and he said “do you remember that weird kid Ethan?” I said “Oh yeah the kid who always sat alone at lunch did he move or something?” My friend waited a second then said “Dude, he went missing that day while at the event”. I replied by saying something like really or stop messing with me but he just changed the subject. I would try to circle back to it but he wouldn’t say more. Idk this seems weird. I'll ask some of my other friends and see what they know about it.\n\nDrake234: Wait a minute… Did you live in Lynn Massachusetts as a kid?\n\nOP:No I lived in Lowell Massachusetts why?\n\nDrake234:That’s where I grew up and something similar happened where some kid who also had no friends just disappeared at the event for the show.\n\nOP:That's weird, is it possible the show was only in Massachusetts or something?\n\nDrake234: That’s possible but it's also weird that kids disappeared at both of the events that we know of.\n\nTWO DAYS LATER\n\nSirsun: I also had one of these events and something happened there too\n\nOP: You’re joking right?\n\nSirsun: No\n\nDrake234: Let me guess a kid went missing too?\n\nSirsun: for a little bit yea but they found him somewhat\n\nOP:?\n\nDrake234:?\n\nSirsun: They found his body along the edge of a river nearby he was missing all sorts of organs and was stabbed so many f\\*\\*\\*ing times\n\nDrake234:wait where did you live\n\nSirsun: Springfield Massachusetts\n\nOP: well as much as im creeped out at least we do know that the show seemed to be exclusive to massachusetts\n\nSIX HOURS LATER\n\nOP: Guys my friend that I talked about was just found dead a couple miles away from his apartment and he was stabbed 21 times and was ripped open and missing organs\n\nDrake234: …\n\nOP: that's not all on the wall next to him written in blood it said something about Willy idk the cops wouldn’t tell me they just asked if I knew who Willy might be\n\nSirsun:HOLY SH\\*\\* DUDE\n\nDrake234:wtf\n\nOP:I KNOW RIGHT THE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN HIS DEATH AND SIRSUN’S MISSING KID STORY ARE SO SIMILAR ALONG WITH THE FACT THAT THERE WAS A MESSAGE ABOUT WILLY.\n\nDrake234: calm down man maybe it's a coincidence\n\nOP:oh no\n\nDrake234:...\n\nSirsun:?\n\nOP: I just went to get some water and the window in my kitchen was open\n\nSirsun: So?\n\nOP: I have never opened that window once since I moved in \n\nOp:I heard something in my closet \n\nSirsun: calm down I’m sure its nothing\n\nOP: I seengfdnnerjhngfdskkjgjrhjyrllsdmjgme\n\nSirsun: r u okay\n\n10 minutes later\n\nSirsun: this isnt funny\n\n1 day later\n\nDrake234: is he okay\n\nSirsun: I'm not sure this is either real or some sick prank I can do some digging to see if I cn find out\n\nDrake234 ok\n\n1 day later\n\nSirsun: Okay now listen, don't ask how I got this information but I found out his name was Jim Kaydence and I googled his name and found he was killed. He was found in a nearby factory stabbed at least 20 times, ripped open and missing organs.\n\nDrake234: ur joking right?\n\nSirsun: no\n\nDrake 234: HOLY SH\\*\\*\n\nSirsun: ikr\n\nDrake234:NO NOT THAT I JUST LOOKED OUTSIDE AND SAW SOME DUDE DRESSED AS WILLY FROM THE SHOW STARING AT ME\n\nSirsun:no f\\*\\*\\*ing way\n\nDrake234: Im calling the cops\n\nDrake234: I’m gonna keep you updated I want you to tell the cops to try to do something in case something happens\n\nSirsun: Ok\n\nSirsun: Drake?\n\nSirsun:Drake\n\nDrake234: Spread what you know to others or we will find your family and we will feast on them like we feasted on Jim and Carl and all the others we have killed.\n\nDear readers I must apologize to you but they threatened my family.",

        "text": "As per the title, I don’t think I want to go to school anymore. I don’t know what it is, I just have a bad feeling. It's the thought I’ve had running in my head all morning.\n\nThe day began normally. I went to the school office to turn on my phone. We aren’t allowed to have it on us. My best friend, let’s call him Sam, told me I was a “goody-two-shoes.” I laughed it off, stating not everyone can be a big rebel like him. We’re close like that, we can give each other a little bit of a tease, but we both know we’re still friends. Besides, I really didn’t care; I didn’t need my phone for the day, and getting sent to the principal Jenkin’s office for such a small thing just really wasn’t worth it. I don’t know why, but that office just really gave me an uneasy feeling.\n\nMr. Jenkins seems like a kind enough guy, but there was something about him that always made me feel a bit off. A lot of the students made fun of him for his buck teeth and red hair, but I think that’s just juvenile humor to be honest. Yet I can’t help but admit that sometimes I join in. I feel bad for it, but it's the only way to fit in. Even so, sometimes Mr. Jenkins gives you this odd look, sometimes, like he knows you’re up to something. It’s kind of like he can read your mind. Which is just silly, of course. I don’t even know why I’m talking about it.\n\nIn math class today Sam got in trouble for misbehaving. It wasn't anything major, just some goofing off that got out of hand. You know, just too much chatting, and joking around. We both drew a crude picture of Mr. Jenkins and I think he may have also been blamed for that. I don’t quite remember. Either way, he was sent to the principal’s office. Sam thought it was an amusing punishment and was off on his merry way.\n\nAnyway, later on it was modern history class. I kept looking around searching for Sam. He never showed up. That was odd, I thought, surely he wouldn’t miss out on a whole day of school over one tiny little incident. Maybe Jenkins was more angry than I thought he’d be. Maybe he was suspended. I don’t know. It seems like an overreaction if that’s the case. Unless Sam had stirred the pot, which he was known to do on occasion.\n\nAnyway, by the end of the day Sam was still nowhere to be seen. I started to get a little worried. Maybe he really did get suspended. Or maybe he got sick or something and they sent him home. When I got my phone back from the school office, I immediately checked my texts. Nothing was sent to me. I hoped quietly that his phone wasn’t confiscated, and looked for him in my contacts. Nothing there. Wait, that's unusual, why wouldn’t I have his phone number saved? I asked the admin lady if she knew where Sam was.\n\nShe raised an eyebrow and said: “I don’t know who that is.”\n\nAnd I said, “He’s in my grade. C’mon, he’s - “ - I started to describe his appearance, but suddenly I couldn’t remember the color of his hair. Was he tall? Maybe he was my height?\n\nThe admin lady clicked her tongue. “Last name?”\n\n“His name is Sam - “, I started to say. But I stuttered on my words. Sam… Sam who?\n\nThe admin lady shook her head. “Stop playing games with me. Go home.” I found myself at a loss for words. His name is… He…\n\n“Sorry, Ma’am,” I said, “I don’t remember why I’m here.”.\n\nAt night my brother hogged the TV all night playing Fortnite with his mates. I let him be. I didn’t have anyone to play games with anyway. No one would play with me. They all thought I was weird. And no one would be able to stand me stuttering into the microphone. So I just went to my room. I am my best company, I thought to myself.\n\nThat night on Twitter I saw that someone had made a very crude image of me in microsoft paint and posted it for everyone to laugh at. The comments people made about me that night on Twitter were so terrible I almost wanted to punch my screen. Luckily my mum called my brother and me out to dinner, which was an excellent excuse to log off and forget about twitter.\n\nBut after dinner I brushed my teeth; and suddenly I couldn’t stand to look at the mirror. I found myself hating buck teeth. My awful red hair. The thought of going to school again, to face the bullying again, just made me sick to my stomach. I just really, really do not want to go to school again. To sit by myself at lunch. To have no one to goof off with when class gets boring. It's making me depressed guys. Even the principal is more popular than me.\n\nI’ve been just browsing reddit all night pretending that this crushing loneliness does not bother me. But I think I have to face up to the truth. I have no friends. I am a complete loner. And so, I need your advice guys. How do I do it? Is there anything I can do about my appearance? How do I make friends when I’m such a pathetic loser.",

        "text": "\"So, look we have to ask you a few questions before we even considering sending you back, okay?\"* The scientist said in an enthusiastic but yet weary voice. He asked some what I'm guessing were protocol questions.\n\n*\"You know what period you're being sent to?\"* I nodded, \"The Roman Empire.\" *\"Not just the Roman Empire! You're going to the end of the Crisis of the Third Century, there's a lot you need to know and remember.\"* He huffed but I just continued to listen in silence. *\"Remember, your Latin is ecclesiastic, not Roman. It differs a bit but it'll give you the foundations to get by. Just avoid talking about God. The Romans really didn't like the Christians at this point.\"* \n\n\"Is that it?\" I looked at the now team of scientists messing around on computers, giant screens, writing things down. The now unarranged book shelves which they forced me to read front to back and back to front to ensure I wouldn't alter the timeline, to ensure I would blend in and survive. \n\n*\"Okay, look we won't lie. The museums also didn't like sponsoring this trip so you will have very little money, just whatever coins we could find in recent archaeological digs that we may or may not have reported to the other wings of the government. I won't snitch if you don't.\"* He let out a small chuckle, more like a nervous wheeze more so than anything. \n\n*\"Finally, upon arrival within the Eternal City, find somewhere private. I have included a set of rules for survival in your coin purse. It's double-sided. One side is the societal rules you must obey within the Eternal City. One side is to optimise your experience.\"* \n\nRules to optimise my experience? Probably should've told me these while I was preparing all these months, reading and doing language classes. But, okay, maybe it was a last minute oversight. I followed the scientists to the machine. A towering, mechanical, mess. Nothing on it makes sense. But hey, at least I won't have to do anything, I'm not the brains.\n\nA countdown from 10 later and with a loud flash, I awoke with what felt to be the worst hangover ever. A stomach that felt like a washing machine and a headache that felt like a 2 inch drill bit was penetrating my temple. \n\nI spent a while laying down to compose myself, only after I'd say five or so minutes did I actually bother to stand up and begin walking down the alleyway I found myself in. A beautiful city emerged in front of me as I stood into the light, beautiful homes with elegant pots outside their doors and windows, a beauty of the ancient Latin language landed upon my ears, chants of \"Christiani Delenda Est\" filled what looked like the Aventine hill if my memory served correct. I walked over to one of the pots outside a home and filled my hands with liquid inside only to splash my face. The overwhelming and potent stench of urine filled my nose and everyone around me began to give me death glares. I immediately knew my mistake.\n\nFuck it, I decided, I shall explore this beautiful city as much as possible. I visited the pubs, the fast food stalls, the forums, but then I remembered the money problem. So I just travelled to the nearest bath house I could and sat down at a bench. A man approached and immediately introduced himself. \n\n*\"What province are you from? It is easy to spot you outsiders, the amazement on your face tells your story.\"* I looked to him and laughed. \"My father is Vandal, my mother is from the civilised province of Dalmatia. And I guess you are from this city? My name is...\" I paused... \"Iovius.\" \n\n*\"Well... Iovius... I am Aper, born during the Consulship of Virtorinus and* *the glorious Imperator Caesar Marcus Aurelius Probus Augustus of his fifth Consulship. I am an Aedile within the senate, how about I show you more of our city my friend? Show you the glory that your barbarian father resisted all those years ago.\"*\n\nI paused once again, slowly but surely translating his words one by one. As the vocabulary swirled around my mind I couldn't help but noticed the features of Aper. A lighter skinned man than most here, blue eyes. His hair was styled just like anyone else's. But something just seemed off.\n\n\"Sure, lead me through the city that your ancestors have built.\" I wondered, should I make the joke. I couldn't resist. \"Was it really built in a day?\" Aper just looked back at me and smiled. Woah.. The Romans really were arrogant and superstitious I assume. After a long day he brought me to his home, we ate and he brought me to a bed to sleep in. I thanked him and only then did I remember the note in my coin purse.\n\nI looked at side A.\n\n1. *No weapons beyond the Pomerium.*\n2. *Respect the Vestal Virgins*\n\nI just turned the page over before finishing the rest. Did they really not trust me to remember the societal rules of Rome? Side B was more... Sinister.\n\n1. *Remember, don't do anything to disrupt the timeline. You can do as you please just don't go killing people or robbing people. Just be decent and don't disrupt people in their duties. To do so would be to alter the future entirely.*\n2. *The year is 302AD, as much as we love to argue politics and religion in our time. Mention these things then and you'll be killed, it's one year before Diocletian's persecutions. If you're killed, we honestly don't know how this will effect the timeline or the future, could be a paradox, you could just cease to be. We don't know if the universe has a sense of humour.*\n3. *You're not the first subject who has gone to this time period. Just be wary. The last man we brought back was traumatised. He kept muttering something about a twenty year old boar? If you could retrieve us that information too that'd be brilliant. He claimed to have been attacked, we saved him in the nick of time though!*\n4. *Please keep an eye out for a man with blue eyes. We know this is a big ask, but it is the ancient Romans. Not many had blue eyes, they were Mediterranean. Our first subject was a man in his late teens/early twenties and he has not yet returned. We need to retrieve him.*\n\nI began pondering the last two \"rules.\" Aper has blue eyes. His age... I mean... I don't know! I don't know who was consul for every year, Victorinus? Who has he? I knew of Probus but he had so many reigns as Consul. It is then the door slowly pushed itself open, a swords gleam behind the shadow only reflected by the candle carried alongside it. It finally sunk in... Aper..\n\nWriters note: Since I'm too lazy to answer potential questions about Aper. Aper is Latin for \"The boar.\" I know the ending is rushed but it's my first story so hopefully plenty of potential to grow.",

        "author": "morningstaraldan",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/102rcrm/alcove_mist_hospital_rules/",
        "text": "  \n\nSo, you have decided to work as a doctor here in Alcove Mist Hospital, I believe that the administration had already briefed you of the basics, but they did not specify about the *things* going on in here. You will receive this letter as soon as any weird occurrence has happened to you. I mean, I would know, as I received the same letter years ago when I first started working here. If you however, received this letter before any weird has happened to you, I’m sorry but you have to file a resignation immediately and never come back to this place again. The hospital did not choose you, and you do not want to know what happens if you force your stay.\n\nIf you, however, did receive this after any weird incidence took place, then follow these rules to ensure your safety and sanity within this hospital.\n\n1. The patients admitted here are always meant to die, the *treatments* provided here are… well, let’s just say it helps to ensure that the dead would remain dead. If you see a patient trying to get out of the premises, tell security immediately and they will handle the rest. Do not let any patient out under any circumstances.\n\n2. All patients within the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) follow the same routine on their last days “alive”:\n\n   2.1. On the first 5 days of their stay, a reddish-brown liquid, resembling a mixture of phlegm and feces will always appear on their bedsheets. It is imperative to put these sheets away and replace them immediately whenever you see them, even if the patient is not within your rounds or even if you have already checked out for the day/night. Breaking this rule would not result to anything drastic, but it does keep the hospital from smelling too bad.\n\n   2.2. For the next 3 days, patients would start to hallucinate, even if they are in a vegetative state. They would speak in gibberish, but staff noted that it sounds like a combination of Latin and German, though no coherent words can be understood. If you are in a room with a patient that started to speak in tongues, cover your ears immediately. Do not listen to anything that they are saying, no matter how enticing it sounds. The last doctor who listened was next to be admitted in this hospital.\n\n  2.3. Patients always die on the 10th day, if by any means that the patient is still alive by 12:00 midnight of the 11th day, shoot the patient in the head using the designated firearm on the lowermost drawer of their bedside cabinet. Report to the nurses immediately after this. Do not let any patient survive after the 10th day, just… do not.\n\n   2.4. If any patient did not follow these same steps, report to Dr. Halley immediately, assist her in handling the patient and do whatever she asks you to do.\n\n3. Each hallway is named after a letter in the alphabet, if you stumble upon a hallway bearing a different name other than a letter in the alphabet, or a hallway with no name at all, stay still and close your eyes for 15 seconds, count in your head if you must. After 15 seconds, open your eyes and check for the hallway’s name.\n\n   3.1. If it is a letter-named hallway, proceed wherever you need to go. But do it immediately, you wouldn’t want to stay for too long here if these happens.\n\n   3.2. If it is a named hallway but not from the alphabet, go inside any room. There would be at least one open room in any hallway, force your way in if necessary. Once inside, close all lights and hide. Page the nurses about where you are, wait for them to find you, and remember to set a password for them to know that they are really the ones knocking on your door. Whenever someone asks for you to open the door, ask them for your password, if they say anything other than your password, respectfully decline to open the door. They will get insistent, but do not falter, keep waiting until the nurses arrive and escort you out of the hallway.\n\n   3.3. If it’s a blank hallway, turn back and run as fast as you can. Run until you reach a letter-named hallway. Do not however, go outside of the hospital vicinity, you are not where you think you are.\n\n4. Dr. Evans is the chief doctor of this hospital, you will only see him in the cafeteria though. Interact with him, he is quite nice to new faces in the hospital. If he likes you, he will give you a coin, always keep that coin in your person, it will provide protection in some way that I cannot really explain. If he didn’t like you however, he will cut you off in the conversation and walk away, do not follow him and never go to the cafeteria ever again.\n\n5. At 3:00 A.M. the speakers would always play a prayer. This prayer does not belong to any known religion and would always sound intelligible. Once you hear these sounds coming from the speakers, stand still and bow your head. Your environment might seem to shift but do not pay it any attention, they will try their best to distract you and make you look up. If you looked up while this is happening, strengthen your mind as you will need it for what you are about to see.\n\n6. The 3rd floor is out of bounds, under no circumstance must you bring yourself on that floor. Skip the room that you were designated from this floor, continue to refuse even if the staff gets mad at you or if the administration threatens to terminate your contract, they will eventually reassign the room to another doctor. But do not tell the newly assigned doctor about the 3rd floor, everyone should know that it is out of bounds. Saying anything about the 3rd floor to another doctor would make the administration force you to take the room on that floor, good luck if that happens.\n\n7. Once every 16 months, an event called \\[REDACTED\\] occurs in the hospital. Whenever this happens, the hospital will go on a lockdown, and everyone inside must stay for at least \\[REDACTED\\] hours after the event initiates. Locate the nearest \\[REDACTED\\] and hide there for the duration of the event, ignore all sounds coming from outside. Do not look outside. Do not go outside. \n\n8. If you ever encounter an individual named “Dr. Luis” or “Dr. Landon” he will ask you for someone:\n\n   8.1. If he asked for a patient, direct them to the correct room. Let him walk in front of you, do not turn your back away from him. Do not break your line of sight with him until he goes in the room and closes the door. Do not enter in the room with him. Do not investigate what he will do to the patient. \n\n   8.2. If he asked for another doctor, direct him outside of the hospital. Do not tell him that you are escorting him out, though. Try to make it look like you are directing him to the correct room, run in circles if necessary as long as you could get him out of the hospital. Let him walk in front of you, and do not break your line of sight with him until he leaves the hospital’s premises. Once he’s out, lock the hospital doors, he might try to come back in but try your best to stop him. You do not want him to come back in again.\n\n   8.3. If he asked for Dr. Evans, tell him that he is in the cafeteria. He would thank you and go on his way. Get out of the hospital immediately.\n\n   8.4. If he asked for anyone else other than those three mentioned above, run away as fast as you can. Do not look back at him, just run until you can’t hear his ungodly screams anymore.\n\n9. Always take the elevators in the morning, and the stairs at night. Never use them in a different time, you will be transported somewhere far from this world. Do not break this rule as it takes an enormous amount of effort and resources to locate individuals who have wandered there to the point that the administration just stopped trying to find them. If you find yourself using the stairs in the morning, or the elevators at night, then you are as good as dead.\n\n10. If you break the first rule, burn the whole hospital to the ground. I know it sounds difficult and tedious, but please, end our suffering.\n\nThat’s it, this pretty much sums up everything that you need to know to work here in Alcove Mist Hospital, even with its bizarre rules, it is quite nice working here (and the pay sure is good too). I hope I see you around as a doctor still, it is always such a pain to see newcomers turn into one of the patients in the beds.",

        "text": "# The backstory\n\nJuly 3rd, 2010 is when all of this started. It was a pretty normal and boring day, or so i thought.I started my day by waking up, brushing my teeth, preparing breakfast for me and my wife and planned what i was going to do this day. I decided to continue the new game me and my friends were working on. I had a lot of hard work to do because my friend Mark had a good idea that would improve our game by a lot. Anyways, i was pretty tired from all the work and wanted to go to my local park.\n\nI went to my front door, tried to open it but it didn't work. I thought that i locked the door with my keys so i tried to unlock the door but instead it locked it. I said \"Hmm, that's weird. Is my door broken?\" I unlocked the door but it still wouldn't open.\n\nIn that moment i knew, that my door is broken. I called 911 but due to unexpected high calls i wasn't able to reach them. I tried calling them again, just to reach the mailbox. I tried again and again but always reached the mailbox. After 8 more tries i gave up and went to the nearest window and tried to get some attention. I screamed as loud as i could but nobody noticed. Everybody just pretended as if i didn't even exist. I tried to jump out of the window but was just teleported back inside my bed. That's when i knew that i'm trapped inside my own house.\n\nI calmed myself down and just went working on the game again. After 6 hours i noticed that my wife wasn't back home and decided to call her but reached the mailbox. i tried again and again just to reach the mailbox. I lost all contact with my friends, my family, my wife and was really depressed.\n\nI went to bed, closed my eyes and prayed that tomorrow everything would be normal again. I woke up the next day, ran straight to my front door and it was still locked. I went to my computer, wanted to work on the game but noticed that all the work was gone. I was sure that i saved my progress and made even a backup but that's also gone. another thing i also noticed is that the date is the same, I thought i was dreaming but i wasn't. \"Am i in a loop?\" was the only thing that i was thinking about. Surely it was just a stupid thought, right?\n\nI went back to the window, jumped out of the window and was teleported back into my bed. i repeated this for who knows how long and just gave up. I went to my closet, picked up my axe and went to my front door. I swung my axe against my wooden-glass door but it didn't even make a scratch.The axe flung back to my direction and the blade almost hit my foot. \"H-How did that axe not even make a scratch against that door?!\" With all of my anger, i picked up the axe again and ran straight against my door, hitting the door as hard as i possibly could, just to make a small, tiny dent. Seeing that dent made me lose all hope of escape and made me have serious suicidal thoughts.\n\nAt my last attempt to be get out of my coma, i decided to burn my own house down, in hopes that a fire crew would rescue me. I let my frozen pizza on the stove, max temperature and waited. My smoke detector had gone off and i just let it ring. 5 minutes later my entire kitchen was burning and it got so bad that even black smoke escaped from the windows. 7 minutes later half of my home was burning but i heard police and fire trucks sirens and gave me motivation to scream as loud as i could again. This time people and even the fire crew noticed me and came to my house to evacuate me. The fire crew placed a crash pad for me to jump on and without thinking i jumped but noticed that there was a hole and landed but broke my left leg from the hard impact. I was immediately rushed into the hospital.\n\nI woke up, seeing my family, doctor and wife right next to me, being shocked that i woke up. I asked them \"What's wrong?\" In a very tired tone. \"You were in a coma for 12 years and just woke up.\" I couldn't believe him. \"We're gonna run multiple tests on you before we let you go.\" Little did i and everyone around me know what was about to happen.",

        "text": "Hi - I am Mary. I am an orphan and I still haven't found a family yet.\n\n The reason why I am writing this post is, that you never go to an abandoned Building that had paranormal sightings at night (especially at Halloween night)\n\nMy friends that I had been around with since 4th grade had the idea of going to an abandoned building near the woods.\n\n It was an old Orphanage that they found on a sketchy website and they decided that it would be cool, if we go to that on Halloween night, since we didn't have any plans and Halloween was right around the Corner.\n\n So 2 days passed, and my friends and I arrived at a restaurant near that building. We ate and had a good time there and after we gave the waiter a 20% tip because of his great service, we made our way to the abandoned building.\n\n The lawn looked like it just got mowed and I grew a little bit of suspicion, but my friend Brian told me to just shake it out of my head, like it is nothing.\n\n As soon as we arrived in the middle of the lawn infront of the porch and door, It began to be foggy. Obviously that was a red flag for me and it almost made me leave my friends there and walk home. \n\nIf I better had left! My friends might have followed me and made something different but no, my $tupid a$$ did not leave.\n\n The door to the building was locked and the windows where barricaded and I thought: ''Thank God'' but then one of my friends pulled out a crowbar from nowhere and ripped off the wooden planks and busted down the window and after, we headed inside. \n\nWe took out our Flashlights and began to look for a lightswitch, even though we thought the lights wouldn't work. Surprisingly, they did work, but the light was very dim. That one lightswitch set off every lightbulb in the building. \n\nWe decided to split up into groups of 2. Dave and I went upstairs while Brian and Silvia stayed in this floor. They said we should go explore more of that building and we went to the 2nd floor.\n\n The first room was chaotic with babybeds and creepy dolls in them. There also where some dolls laying on the ground and as we left the room we heard one say : '' Ma-Ma'' I was terrified and Dave comforted me saying everything is going to be OK.\n\n The 2nd room was a bathroom and It was covered in Blood and other body liquids that I better not list here.\n\n The lights went out an the door shut. We tried to open it many times and on the 7th try it finally opened. \n\nBrian and Silvia haven't switched on the Power generator in the basement and we figured to check it out.\n\n They weren't there and I turned it on again and left the basement while Dave stayed. He found a strange painting in there and he really was interested in it. While he stared at that painting I found and pulled a lever not knowing what will happen. \n\nA thick glass door trapped Dave in the basement and spikes were coming out of the walls. They started moving and Dave was screaming as loud as he can and banged his hands on the glass door to get help.\n\n I ran into a room that had a crowbar identical to the one that Brian used to break the barricade on a table and I grabbed it and sprinted to the door, trying to break it with it. \n\nAs I thought it is too late, the last bang of the tool in my hands broke the door and I got a glass piece into my arm. It really had hurt but the most important thing is that Dave was able to escape just in time, before being impaled by the spikes and crushed from the wall.\n\n He was terrified and cried a bit and I tried to comfort him, which didn't work that good.\n\n I looked over his shoulder and found a hallway that I think got opened by the lever. I told him to follow me into the corridor and there were 2 doors at the end of them. we could hear screaming from both doors and decided to go into the first door.\n\n Silvia was strapped on a hospital bed n@ked and there was a venomous tarantula on her chest, crawling up. Dave took action and grabbed it, risking being bitten. He threw it on the floor and crushed it with his shoe and I helped freeing her from the tape and rope.\n\n I gave her a 2nd pair of pants, because I always have 2, just incase that p3riod hits because I am late on it again. I also gave her my Jacket and we went outside to go into the other room.\n\n We were horrified seeing Brian in his shape. He got stabbed multiple times in his throat which lead to his vocal chords being destroyed, his left arm got ripped off, he got scalped, his right arm was snapped in half, his feet got broken and half of his face got ripped off.\n\nWhat's even worse is, He was still alive. Some ghost mutilated him first and then it used their supernatural power to keep him alive through all his pain.\n\nWe immediately ran out of that room horrified by what we just saw and found a book on the floor.

        "text": "July 3rd, 2010 is when all of this started. It was a pretty normal and boring day, or so i thought.  \nI started my day by waking up, brushing my teeth, preparing breakfast for me and my wife and planned what i was going to do this day. I decided to continue the new game me and my friends were working on. I had a lot of hard work to do because my friend Mark had a good idea that would improve our game by a lot.  \nAnyways, i was pretty tired from all the work and wanted to go to my local park.  \n\n\nI went to my front door, tried to open it but it didn't work. I thought that i locked the door with my keys so i tried to unlock the door but instead it locked it. I said \"Hm, that's weird. Is my door broken?\".  \nI unlocked the door but it still wouldn't open.  \n\n\n In that moment i knew, that my door is broken. I called 911 but due to unexpected high calls i wasn't able to reach them. I tried calling them again, just to reach the mailbox. I tried again and again but always reached the mailbox. After 8 more tries i gave up and went to the nearest window and tried to get some attention. I screamed as loud as i could but nobody noticed. Everybody just pretended as if i didn't even scream. I tried to jump out of the window but was just teleported back inside my bed. That's when i knew that i'm trapped inside my own house.  \n\n\nI calmed myself down and just went working on the game again. After 6 hours i noticed that my wife wasn't back home and decided to call her but reached the mailbox. i tried again and again just to reach the mailbox. I lost all contact with my friends, my family, my wife and was really depressed.  \n\n\nI went to bed, closed my eyes and prayed that tomorrow everything would be normal again.  \nI woke up the next day, ran straight to my front door and it was still locked. I went to my computer, wanted to work on the game but noticed that all the work was gone. I was sure that i saved my progress and made even a backup but that's also gone. another thing i also noticed is that the date is the same, I thought i was dreaming but i wasn't. \"Am i in a loop?\" was the only thing that i was thinking about. Surely it was just a stupid thought, right?  \n\n\nI went back to the window, jumped out of the window and was teleported back into my bed. i repeated this for who knows how long and just gave up. I went to my closet, picked up my axe and went to my front door. I swung my axe against my wooden-glass door but it didn't even make a scratch.  \nThe axe flung back to my direction and the blade almost hit my foot. \"H-How did that axe not even make a scratch against that door?!\" With all of my rage, i picked up the axe again and ran straight against my door, hitting the door as hard as i possibly could, just to make a small, tiny dent.  \nSeeing that dent made me lose all hope of escape and made me have serious suicidal thoughts.  \n\n\nAt my last attempt to be rescued, i decided to burn my own house down, in hopes that a fire crew would rescue me. I let my frozen pizza on the stove, max temperature and waited. My smoke detector had gone off and i just let it ring. 5 minutes later my entire kitchen was burning and it got so bad that even black smoke escaped from the windows. 7 minutes later half of my home was burning but i heard police and fire trucks sirens and gave me motivation to scream as loud as i could again. This time people and even the fire crew noticed me and came to my house to evacuate me. The fire crew placed a crash pad for me to jump on and without thinking i jumped but noticed that there was a hole and landed but broke my left leg from the hard impact. I was immediately rushed into the hospital.  \n\n\n  \nI woke up, seeing my family, doctor and wife right next to me, being shocked that i woke up. I asked them \"What's wrong?\" In a very tired tone. \"You were in a coma for 12 years and just woke up.\" I couldn't believe him. \"We're gonna run multiple tests on you before we let you go.\" Little did i and everyone around me know what was about to happen.",

I’m writing you in confidence, because I know you have some experience with this. I didn’t know who else to bring this to. We’ve been doing walkthroughs and the piers are cracked. TransEd is saying it’s because they ordered two types of concrete and they weren’t miscible. Our testing seems to indicate that the crack is from a low frequency vibration, much like how a bridge would collapse, although I’ve never seen this in relation to a land-based pier before. It’s difficult to explain, I would much prefer if we could talk in person. Faraj agreed with me about the source of the cracks, and he’s rarely wrong. I apologize if I’m reaching out in error, but we’re at a complete loss. Please give me a call when you have a chance.

The cube had no cracks. It was perfectly smooth when it rose up from the water. At times it looked like a pencil drawing, scribbled and shaded in on one side. \n\nI had come back to ask it a question.\n\nFour years ago I had discovered a car-sized concrete cube that my project management and engineering team had incorporated into Edmonton’s Tawatina bridge, a cube that had been emitting a low vibration and was seemingly destroying the rest of the valley line (as well as apparently driving people to suicide), I had returned to the original site that had caused my demise. It had caused one of my employees, Bill, to nearly take his own life. It had caused countless other contractors to experience things they couldn’t explain. It had caused me to essentially lose everything: my business and my family, and especially my sanity. I could at times hear it humming. Then, cracks started to appear on the piers further down the line, connected to the bridge.\n\nSo now was the time of reckoning. I needed to know why. Why me?\n\nI was in my car, and for some reason I parked in Windsor car park. The University of Alberta campus is quite far from the Tawatina bridge. I remember walking along Saskatchewan Drive, and pausing ever so often to look at posted trail maps. I couldn’t read them, they seemed to be all mixed-up and gibberish to me. It was early afternoon, and a storm seemed to be gathering out of the west. \n\nEventually the sidewalk ended next to 99th street. I crossed and headed towards the four glass pyramids of the Muttart Conservatory. I crossed 98th avenue without looking to see if traffic had stopped. An angry middle-aged man with a *Fuck Trudeau* sticker on his Dodge Ram swerved, honked, and showed me his middle finger when I had to be avoided.\n\nI wasn’t sure how to get to the cube now that it was a part of the Tawatina bridge. So, I crawled down to the rocky outcrop that held the first pier. \n\nI stood there.\n\nNothing happened.\n\n“Hey!” I yelled at the river.\n\nTwo homeless people emerged from the bushes where it became clear they hid a tent. They must have thought I was yelling at them. When they realized I wasn’t looking in their direction, they turned and continued back into the bush. \n\n“Hey…Cube!” I tried.\n\nOne of the homeless people came back out. \n\n“You got a smoke?” He asked me. His face was heavily scarred, as if he had been cut or burnt. \n\n“No, sorry.” I shrugged.\n\n“There’s nothing you can do to make it stop singing.” He said. I initially wrote him off as high on meth, as I had assumed so many of the citizens inhabiting the river valley were. But then I paused for a second.\n\n“Wait, make what stop singing?” I asked.\n\n“The bridge. You can’t hear that? It’s like a humming noise, and it gets louder at night.” He scoffed at me and turned back into the brush.\n\nWhy couldn’t I hear it? I could *always* hear it. Sometimes in bed. Sometimes driving. Sometimes in a different city. Why couldn’t I hear it now?\n\n“Come back and talk to me!” I yelled at the bridge, now becoming furious that after all this time it was denying me.\n\nI picked up some rocks and hurled them into the water. The storm was moving closer. The wind picked up and blew gravel into my eyes. I decided to start heading back. I left with a parting shot. “Fine! Fuck you! Asshole!”\n\nI turned and went to climb the embankment back to the path, and start the long trek back to my car. I had taken no more than two steps before I slipped and fell immediately backward. I simultaneously heard a crunch and a thud, both of my back and my head hitting the rocks. Pain immediately shot up from my tailbone to my neck and gripped me. I had hit my head and for a moment, could see nothing but white. I tried to struggle back to my feet, but my legs were uncooperative. I started to feel a numbness coming over me. \n\n“Help! Hello! Help!” I yelled. It was clear I needed medical attention. My head throbbed. Where had the homeless people that were mere feet from me gone?\n\n“Can you hear me? I need help! Someone!” I screamed at the top of my lungs. I did not see anyone approach or hear anyone call back. The sky was growing darker with thick storm clouds, and thunder began echoing off the tall buildings of downtown, all of them steel-blue in my blurry vision. \n\nI took out my phone and tried to dial 911.\n\n*Call failed*.\n\nI had no service. How was that possible, I was right between the two most densely populated areas in Edmonton. \n\nI yelled up at the bridge. “Hey! Can you see me down here? Send help!” I could see pedestrians and joggers crossing, but none of them responded or even looked over the edge. \n\nI looked around for anyone else that may be near. I tried to wave to the opposite bank, and up on the bridge with my arms, but I could barely lift them. I realized that quite a large pool of blood had been gathering around my head and neck area. I started to get dizzy, and feel very weak. I tried yelling again but began to cough up blood.\n\nWas this it? Was this how I’d go out? A bloody mess next to the Tawatina bridge pier?\n\nI clutched my phone. Still no service. So instead, resigning my fate, I clicked on my camera roll, and let my gaze fall on my children one last time. A picture of them from a few weeks ago when we had gone for a picnic at Chikakoo Lake. \n\nThe skies opened up, and suddenly it was pouring. However, the cold rain felt warm against my skin, as I faded in and out of consciousness. I tried to hold the image of my kids in my mind: the green and yellow of the foliage, their smiling faces bouncing around on playground equipment. My daughter embracing me, my son telling me how happy he was, and how it was the *best day ever*.\n\nI had somehow slipped into the river. Submerged, I expected the water to be freezing and tumultuous as it appeared on the surface, but it was not. It was lukewarm and still. I sank to the bottom, face down, not being able to kick with my legs, and still on the edge of consciousness. I fumbled around against the riverbed. I had assumed it would be mucky, soft, and dirty. But it was smooth and cool, like the bottom of a glass aquarium. \n\n*I had found it!*\n\nI tried, with all my remaining energy, to knock and somehow enter. But nothing came. I ran out of breath. I began inhaling water while desperately thrashing, unable to make it back to the surface, and eventually resigning myself to the fact I would die. I saw my kids in my mind’s eye once again, on a fall afternoon. \n\nAnd then white. And red? I breathed in. I could breathe?\n\nI was in the cube.\n\nThe last time I had entered it was white and sterile, cool and crisp like the inside of an ice arena. This time it was warm with the glow of a crackling fire. I could faintly hear a fire, and see the light cast from it, but as I looked around in the four walls, no fire existed. \n\nThe inside of the cube had a floor of polished concrete. The walls were white, as was the ceiling. The last time I was in the cube, I had to walk a very long time to reach a wall, and the walls seemingly expanded to infinity, or at least as large as the cube wanted, I thought. This time was different. The interior seemed smaller, the ceiling height much lower, probably about 9 or 10 feet. The distance between the walls seemed about 30 feet in each direction, and the walls didn’t seem to escape me as I approached them.\n\nI walked to over to one wall and pounded on it. \n\n“Can you hear me now, you motherfucker?” I wailed.\n\nNothing.\n\nI walked over to the adjacent wall and began kicking it.\n\n“Do you feel that? Answer me!”\n\nI approached the third wall. It seemed to be highly polished. I ran my hand along it, looking for a seam or button, or any small imperfection that would give the cube some sort of depth, life, or history. I found only the reflection of my fingers, which did not even leave fingerprint marks on the surface.\n\nI began to reason. If there was a reflection, and I could see clearly inside the cube, then there must be a source of light somewhere. I began trying to trace the direction of the light source that corresponded with my shadow. I walked and turned, and looked back at the reflection again to see if the orientation had changed. It had! I turned and walked in the other direction, and the reflection changed again! There must be a panel or *something* emitting light from a singular source or direction. I tried a third time. Only this time, the reflection kept going when I stopped. A wave of terror washed over me like receiving a sudden static shock. It wasn’t a reflection. The panel wasn’t completely opaque, and there was someone on the other side. \n\nI quickly started in one direction and then stopped. My mind was racing so quickly about what to do I froze on the spot. What if it was an alien? What if it wasn’t friendly? What if it was someone else trapped down here like me? I ran directly towards it.\n\n“Hey! Hey, are you stuck down here?!”\n\nIt stopped and turned towards the panel and put one hand on the surface. \n\nI put my hand against its resting hand. \n\n“Hey can you hear me?”\n\nIt put its other hand against the glass. I also put my palm against the surface. At least I could confirm they were human hands, probably adult male, about the same size as mine. \n\n“Hey man, knock if you can hear me!”\n\nI pounded on the glass. One of the hands slapped the glass back. We were getting somewhere. If only I could find out how to communicate with it better. \n\n“Do you know morse code? You can tap maybe?” I tapped on the glass. I didn’t actually *know* morse code, but I thought something was better than nothing. The hands shrugged and then pressed themselves back against the surface.\n\nI looked around the room again, desperately trying to find something, anything, that would allow me to make contact with who or whatever was on the other side. A seam indicating a door? A blunt object? \n\nI turned back toward the panel, but the figure was no longer there. I pounded on it a few more times. “Hey! Come back! Let’s communicate!”\n\nI waited a few seconds. Silence.\n\n“Hello?”\n\nI waited longer. It could have been only a minute. It felt like hours. \n\nI shrugged and turned back around.\n\nHe was behind me.\n\nHe *was* me.\n\nI couldn’t move. He charged at me.\n\n“You pestilent fuck, now I’ll finally be rid of you!” It screamed at me. I ducked out of the way as best I could. \n\n“Don’t you fucking run, you’re finally going to get what you deserve!” He took a swing at me. \n\n“Woah, woah stop, what the fuck?” I exclaimed. “I don’t know what you think I did!”\n\nIt tackled me and pinned me down. I would have thought if it truly was me, that I would know all of its moves, and would at least come out even, but whatever this was – it was much stronger than me.\n\n“Nothing. You did nothing. That’s what you are. So just disappear and be the nothing that you are, Goddamnit!” It tried to wrestle with me, to attempt to grab my neck, but we were both equally in compromising positions and I was able to resist. \n\n“You should have insisted they use dynamite or something. Not incorporate it! Now we’re both stuck down here because you’re fucking stupid!” It grunted.\n\n“It wasn’t my call!” I insisted. \n\n“All of you fucking people and your free will. Any one of you could have done it. Bill didn’t have the balls, he had to cut himself instead. Sam wrecked herself on purpose. And you, you’re the most pathetic of all. You cut yourself in the shower you fucking pussy. You’re all a bunch of Goddamned sheep!” It spit on me while it talked. \n\n“It took you four years to come back here? I thought I was getting through to you, but you are too busy hiding out like a little bitch.” I began to become less bewildered and just plain angry. Both angry because of the sudden onslaught of surprise violence, but also angry at myself. The alter-me was right. I did hide. \n\n“Fuck you.” I spit back. \n\n“No, fuck you! I won’t let you leave again. I’ll fucking kill you and every pathetic piece of shit that comes down here until there isn’t a single one of you left.” It barked as it inched it’s hands closer to my neck. \n\nThe interlude of dialogue had left me just enough time to calm down a bit and strategize. Although I was holding him off, I wasn’t in a position to escape. I remembered one or two very basic Jiujitsu moves a friend had taught me once. If he was indeed me, and was really angry as I was prone to become sometimes, he wouldn’t be rational enough to expect it coming. I thought of using a mount escape, it was the very first thing my friend had taught me. I also remember how he showed me you could choke someone with their own Gi. We were both wearing my favorite Whet Blu leather jacket. That would more than suffice. \n\nI kept telling myself *stay calm and focus.*\n\nI managed to begin writhing and bumping enough to throw him slightly off balance. I got my thumb in deep into the collar of the jacket and began to cross and pull. I was right. He didn’t expect it. He instinctively tried to reach his hands to his neck to try and loosen my grip, but I had him very tight. I put him in a full guard.  \n\n“Now who’s the bitch, motherfucker!” I yelled, right before he collapsed. \n\nI rolled him off of me and stood up. Only one of us would leave alive, or, if I was now trapped here, I would certainly not risk having “me” around to try and kill me again. I began to unabashedly kick his head repeatedly, filled with emotion, hate, disgust, until there was barely anything distinguishable left. I was angry at him. I was angry at myself, so that made it okay, but I also wanted to be kind to myself – I had, he had, been through a lot. So I began to weep. I fell to my knees. \n\nThe light inside the cube suddenly grew more intense. It became cooler. I was suddenly aware of the sweat on my brow as cold air blew against it. I slowly rose.\n\nI couldn’t see an exit. I could, however, see on the opposite wall there was something now there.\n\nI began walking towards it. Once again, as with the first time, it seemed to take hours to walk to the other end. \n\nWhen I reached the wall, I turned to look at the distance I had travelled. The other walls seemed just as close as they had when I embarked on the walk, but I could barely see the other me I had just dispatched, a tiny disfigured red dot in the distance. \n\nI turned back to the wall.\n\nOn it was a picture frame, the photo inside being the photo I had taken on the fall picnic of my kids to Chikakoo lake. \n\nUnderneath there was a tiny etching in the wall.\n\n*Now you’ve got something to die for.*\n\n**October 12, 2022**\n\nI woke up to the intensely loud music of *Lamb of God*. It was evening. I tried to peel the sweat soaked and bloody sheets off my body, but they stuck to the self-inflicted wounds I had made trying to escape the hum of the cube earlier. Luckily most of them were superficial, and although they stung, they had slowed down to a small ooze or simply appeared to be bad scratches, as if I had recently adopted a very angry cat.\n\nI got up to clean myself and dress my wounds when my phone rang. It was my friend Steve. I answered.\n\n“Hey man. Can you text me instead, I’m just in Nashville…” I started.\n\n“Yeah, I had to call you though, this was too big a deal to text.” He began. I put him on speaker so I could tend to myself while talking.\n\n“Okay, what’s up?”\n\n“Sam Schecter died.”\n\n“Oh, yeah, I know.” I shrugged. \n\n“Oh did Kelsey get a hold of you?” He said. \n\n“Who’s Kelsey?” I mumbled.\n\n“What do you mean…who’s…what the…didn’t you read it in your email?” Steve stammered.\n\n“I haven’t checked my email in days. Anyway, I haven’t talked to her in years. It is sad though, for sure.”\n\nSteve raised his voice a little. “Dude, I don’t get you sometimes. We all used to be like best friends. Not sure how you can be so nonchalant.”\n\n“Well, I mean yeah, but people die sometimes.” I said as if I hadn’t just had a dream about strangling myself and then kicking in my own skull. \n\n“Not like this, man. Apparently she took a run at a concrete pier with her BMW as fast as she could. There’s dashcam footage someone caught of it, looks like she did it on purpose.” He said, emotionally. \n\n“Hm, wonder why she would do that.” I respondent faintly. \n\n“I dunno man, she seemed like she had everything going for her. Stress, maybe? She was working on the valley line and…”\n\n“She was working on the valley line?” I cut Steve off.\n\n“Yeah, you know how stressful that can be, I mean it made you basically want to retire.” He said, and sort of inappropriately chuckled after. He continued. “Anyway, there will be a service, hope you can come after you get back.”\n\n“Sure thing.” I said, and bid him farewell.\n\nHow did I know Sam was dead? The other “me” had said something about her “wrecking herself on purpose.” But that was a dream. I must have heard it somewhere? Maybe I saw it while checking my email at some other time?\n\nI sat down on the bed. Maybe it was time I went through all my unread emails. \n\nI scrolled all the way back to the first unread. July 16, 2022. I tapped to open the email. I received a notification. It was from Vanessa.\n\n*Don’t forget your prescription! Get out and have a good time!*\n\nI stared at my phone for a long time. Then, I finally rose, walked to the closet, and threw on a pair of jeans and those white python boots I had bought earlier. I past the bathroom mirror just to check myself out before exiting the Air BnB. \n\nScrawled in the steam:\n\n*Now you've got something to die for.*",

        "text": " I had to think pretty hard about what I wanted to focus on in this post, because there’s so much I’ve *talked about* talking about that I didn’t know what direction to take. But while I *will* get into more [pool stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/x87lru/i_work_at_the_night_library_we_operate_under_an/), as promised, and update you on the donations from the [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/z71gzx/i_work_at_the_night_library_sometimes_we_get/), and tell you about my singular encounter with Doug even though it’s maybe a little irrationally difficult for me to discuss, this installment isn’t going to be about any of those things.\n\nToday, I want to explain what’s been going on—what’s *still* going on—as of late. \n\nI said, when I told you about how I went upstairs, that I did it again. One more time. That’s where we’re going to start.\n\nAnd then we’ll talk about the aftermath. \n\nEvery *great* once in a while, something fucks up so badly around here that not even Wiley can fix it. This time, of course, it was the HVAC system. \n\nNow, I don’t think I need to tell you how incredibly careful we have to be letting people into certain areas of the building, and obviously upstairs is usually off limits. But it was unseasonably warm throughout the entirety of fall, and that meant that when our AC went out, it got hotter in the library than it did outside. \n\nI was coming in as Della was heading out (she works during the day a lot; I assume it’s so no one will try to talk to her) and I watched her mop the sweat off her forehead with a cleaning cloth as she made her way toward the door. \n\nAs soon as I set foot inside, I understood why.\n\n“Holy shit,” I muttered, already stripping out of my overshirt as I approached Matt at the desk. “Why’s it a sauna in here?”\n\n“I wanted a spa day,” he quipped drily. He was sweating too, dark hair matted to his forehead. “I’ve been upstairs with Wiley already. They couldn’t figure out what the problem was but the coast seems to be clear up there for now, so. We called in the big guns. They’ll be here soon.”\n\nI swallowed, but didn’t voice my concerns. Matt knew better than I did how risky it was. “Okay,” I agreed instead. “Let me know if you need anything when they get here.”\n\nMatt nodded, offering me a two-fingered salute, and I headed into the back to get to work.\n\nIt took around half an hour for someone to show up, and when they did, Matt knocked on the wall between my desk and circulation, beckoning me out.\n\n“Can you hang up here ‘til we’re done?” he asked. “I’m gonna follow him. In case he needs to know where something is, or, y’know. Whatever.”\n\nHah. Yeah. Whatever.\n\n“Sure,” I said, forcing a smile. “We appreciate you coming out.”\n\nThe maintenance guy was young-ish, somewhere in the ballpark of my age, I assumed, and when he grinned back at me, deep, boyish dimples appeared on either side of his mouth. “Happy to help,” he breezed. “And if *I* can’t get it sorted out, I’ll call my dad.” He pointed to the patch on his jacket, which read ***Murphy’s***. “He’s the boss man. Never seen a job he couldn’t tackle. Now, what do you say we get y’all cooled off?”\n\n“I say hell yeah,” I chuckled, adamantly ignoring the ever-deepening pit in my stomach and knowing full well that Matt was doing the same. *He’s already checked it out,* I reminded myself. *There’s nothing up there. Everything’s fine.*\n\n“Hell yeah!” the guy echoed enthusiastically. “If I break something and the building catches on fire, just holler so I can come put it out. Name’s Sam.”\n\n“Adam,” I responded, reaching across the desk to shake his hand. “If I see flames you’ll be the first to know.”\n\nThey took off.\n\nFor a long while, there was nothing. I checked out a handful of patrons, flipped through a few cookbooks (not for any real reason; I’m a millennial, I have no concept of how to feed myself anything that hasn’t been warmed to perfection under a heat lamp), and finally resorted to bringing some books that had been written in out from my hoard to “clean” them (which, fun fact, actually just consists of *extremely* carefully sanding the pages and praying you don’t tear holes through them). \n\nI was nine novels into my pile when I heard it. \n\nA loud, mechanical screeching. \n\nI held my breath. \n\nWiley appeared from between the stacks, eyes wide. “The hell?” they said.\n\nI shook my head.\n\nI watched their breath catch, too, as we listened. There was a quiet rattling that had started just after the *screech* and hadn’t quite stopped, and the longer it went on the more my brain felt like it was vibrating. \n\n“It’s nothing,” I said. I didn’t believe it and Wiley didn’t either, so I repeated myself in hopes that it would stick. “It’s nothing. They’re just moving stuff around up there and it’s—it’s scraping the floor. That’s all.”\n\n“Yeah,” Wiley agreed hollowly. “That’s all.”\n\nThat was—say it with me—*not all.*\n\nWe did spend a decent stretch of time trying to pretend that it was, but, eventually, the rattling grew louder, and the screeching started back up, and then, you guessed it: screaming.\n\nI was halfway up the stairs before I even knew what had hit me, hollering behind me for Wiley to go and lock the doors so no one could come inside while god-knew-what was going down. \n\nI must have been running, footsteps echoing loudly enough on each step that Matt heard them, because when I’d nearly reached the top, he yelled, “God damn it, Adam, do not come up here!”\n\nI wasn’t going to pay a single fuck of attention to that, obviously, so I pushed myself harder, nearly tripping from the momentum when I reached the landing at the top.\n\nWhat I saw was…\n\nWell.\n\nMake *sure* you’ve read this installment before you continue if you haven’t already or none of the following will make any sense. I’ll give you a moment to check.\n\nBack with me? Okay. Now, have you ever heard the horse-sized-spider-vs-spider-sized-horses dilemma? If you haven’t, let me explain—it’s exactly what it sounds like. In your opinion, what’s worse: one horse-sized spider, or one thousand spider-sized horses (both options with the intent to harm you, for the case of the scenario)?\n\nThere certainly weren’t a thousand miniature winged mechanical monstrosities before me, nor a hundred, nor fifty, nor even ten, but the solid five flailing about with their sticky, dripping wings were enough to both metaphorically and literally bring me to my knees.\n\nThey were identical to the thing I’d encountered upstairs before in most every way, except much smaller—smaller than me, even; only about half my size—and there was a fine coating of fuzz on their batlike wings, almost like a gosling’s down feathers. \n\nThey were circling around in a frenzy, paying me no attention whatsoever, and as soon as my initial shock wore off, I saw why. \n\nThey were entirely occupied by other targets.\n\nOne of them had wrapped itself around Sam, who didn’t look to be fighting back in any capacity, and another two had pinned Matt’s legs and torso to the ground, leaving him to fruitlessly attempt to beat them off with his fists. The rest were watching closely, awaiting their moment to strike.\n\n“Adam!” Matt yelled again, warning. “I mean it!”\n\nI stood and stepped forward, fully into the room.\n\nSomething dripped onto my head.\n\nI touched it, because what the fuck else was I supposed to do, and my fingers came away viscous but still finger-colored. I felt my heart seizing up in my chest, the fear that it might be saliva chilling me to my core, but it dawned on me nearly as quickly as the thought came that if that were the case I would smell it. I shuddered at the memory of the creature’s foul, putrid breath and gathered my courage, tilting my head upward. \n\nThe best way I know to describe the amalgamation of small wires and scraps of metal above me is a nest. Which I guess makes sense if you don’t think about it literally at all. Things with wings=things with nests most of the time, right?\n\nAnyway, I didn’t have long to ponder the logistics, because another glob of the clear substance leaked from a small gap in the structure and, had my reflexes not kicked in at precisely that moment, would have hit me square in the eye. \n\nI bent down to examine it, much easier to study now that it was in *front* of me rather than *on* me, and realized upon prodding that it behaved like a mixture of egg white and some type of oil.\n\n“Matt,” I said, a sinking feeling rooting its way into my stomach. “I think…I think maybe something’s…hatching.”\n\n“I’m only going to say this to you one more time,” Matt threatened, struggle present in his tone. “Get. The fuck. *Out.*”\n\nI hadn’t bothered to respond to his demands thus far, knowing full well that all arguing would accomplish was wasting both our time, but I finally offered, “I’m not leaving you. I’m sorry. I’m not.”\n\nWhen I looked back over to him, to meet his eyes, it was the closest to desperation I’d ever seen him. His expression, his body language, even beneath the monster restraining him, *everything* screamed that he was silently pleading with me to leave. “Something is *wrong,* Adam,” he managed, voice tight. “More wrong than—than just *this*. I wasn’t sure at first; I thought maybe the time had just gotten away from me, but the clock… Are you wearing a watch?”\n\nI wasn’t.\n\nThe sinking feeling sunk more heavily. \n\nI followed Matt’s anxious gaze to the far wall, where the large, digital clock mounted above one of the HVAC monitors read **3:30**. \n\nThe sinking feeling made its way into my feet. \n\n“I came in at seven,” I said dumbly. \n\nThe fucking lights went out.\n\nHave you ever been inside a cave? The kind of darkness so all-encompassing you can’t see your hand in front of your face? That was this. Instant, complete black.\n\nI heard a groan, one that didn’t belong to Matt, and felt a small wave of relief wash over me at the confirmation that Sam must still be alive. I didn’t have any idea how to get to him, however, or any way to gauge where the winged monstrosities were in relation to myself.\n\n“Alright.” *This* was Matt, as calm and measured as I’d ever heard him. “Okay. Adam?”\n\n“Yeah. Right here.”\n\n“Can you walk toward me if I keep talking?”\n\n“I think so,” I said, taking a tentative step forward and to my left. “Are they still…?” But as soon as I asked, I became acutely aware of it. The silence. There was no flapping. No shuffling. No metallic screeching. Nothing.\n\n“Just keep walking,” Matt told me. I wasn’t sure if I liked the evenness to his tone. It sounded almost trained. \n\nI kept walking.\n\nSam groaned again, but didn’t form any intelligible words, so I didn’t bother trying to call out to him. Instead, I asked Matt, “Am I close?”\n\n“Keep coming,” he said, from just ahead of me. “You’re close.” \n\nA handful of steps further and I startled, scarcely stifling a scream as I felt cold fingers wrap around my ankle. But Matt offered a quick assurance of, “It’s okay. It’s me,” and I let out a breath I didn’t know I’d been holding. What he followed with, however, I’d never heard him say before, and it turned my blood to ice. \n\n“I need help.”\n\nI swallowed, grateful, for one millisecond, that the darkness was thick enough to mask my fear. “With what?” I asked, praying I sounded steadier than I felt.\n\n“These…things…are on top of me. They just went limp when the lights went out and they’re too heavy for me to move on my own.”\n\n“Oh,” I said, “god. Okay. You made it sound like something…*worse.* Don’t do that shit.” I lowered myself onto my knees, feeling around in front of me until I had a solid grasp on what I was fairly sure must be the neck of one of the beasts, and counted aloud to three so that Matt would know when to push as I pulled. Together, we dislodged it, casting its motionless form with a ringing *thud* onto the concrete floor. “One down. Is the other one—?”\n\n“On my legs,” Matt said, “mostly.”\n\n“Mostly?”\n\nFor a second, nothing. Then a heavy, defeated sigh as Matt lifted my hand, guiding it up and over his abdomen to finally land on a patch of warm, slick flesh. Not sticky; not like the residue all over him from the monsters’ wings. This was different. This was…\n\n“...Matt.”\n\nThere was no verbal response, but he pressed downward, guiding my fingers to wrap around something long and cylindrical and metallic.  \n\n*“Matt.”*\n\n“There’s a spike at the end of the tail,” he explained, as though he was casually discussing his day. “It’s not barbed or anything, so it’s fine, but it’s too wet for me to pull it out. I can’t get a grip on it.”\n\nI closed my eyes, my vision unchanging, and prepared myself. “Okay,” I said. I’d left my button-down on the back of the chair at the circulation desk, so I tugged my t-shirt over my head and wound it around the thing’s tail, forcing myself not to consider how quickly it was soaking through with blood. “Ready?”\n\n“Ready,” Matt echoed.\n\nAs swiftly as I could, so as not to draw out the pain any longer than I had to, I yanked the tail upward and out of Matt’s side, casting it to the ground and utilizing the remainder of the adrenaline burst to shove the rest of the body off his thighs. \n\nHe didn’t make a peep, but his breathing fell into a shallow, unsteady cadence.\n\n“Okay?” I asked, even though *no,* obviously, he wasn’t. But he would be. Had to be. \n\nFor a moment, I allowed myself to consider the very real possibility that this was what would finally do him in. That he would bleed out at *my* hands, and that there would be nothing I could do to stop it.\n\nBut then he rasped, “Golden,” and I felt my heart start pumping again. \n\n“Good,” I breathed, balling up my shirt and pressing it into his palm. “Here. Can you put pressure on it?”\n\n“Yeah, I got it. Try to get to the kid. See if you can wake him up.”\n\nI forced myself back to my feet, stumbling blindly around in attempt to orient myself, and then, right on cue, Sam made another quiet, pained sound. \n\nI started toward it, shuffling my feet so that if I made it to him I wouldn’t find out by stepping on his fingers and crushing them. \n\nIt was a process—a long one—that consisted of shuffling and stopping to listen and shuffling some more and Matt asking if I’d made it yet and telling him no, but finally, the toe of my shoe came into contact with something.\n\nI bent down, reluctantly reaching out to brush my fingertips over whatever I’d collided with, and immediately relaxed upon registering the sensation of touching very human hair.\n\n“Hey,” I tried, feeling around to find his shoulder and gently shaking it. “Sam?”\n\nI was met with a whine, but no real acknowledgment.\n\n“Sam,” I said again, a little louder, shaking him a little harder. “Come on. Wake up.”\n\nThis time I heard his breath hitch, but I had no idea if it was in response to me or to the pain he was inevitably in. Either way, he still didn’t say anything.\n\n“I’ve got him,” I called back to Matt, “but he’s not—”\n\nWhite. Not *just* white, but the *opposite* of black. The white at the center of a flame. The white you can’t blink away after glancing at the sun, no matter how hard you try. The entire room was awash in it, just as blinding as the darkness, every bit as suffocating.\n\nThen, just as quickly as it had come, it was gone.\n\nThe dim, yellow strip-lights flickered overhead.\n\nI hadn’t even noticed that the constant humming of the HVAC machines had stopped until it started back up again, green and red indicators blinking on in tandem.\n\nI was still crouched next to Sam, and I dared to glance at him, terrified of what I would find.\n\nHe was completely still, and…completely unscathed.\n\nI whipped around, seeking out Matt, and found that he was already up and moving, about halfway across the floor to us.\n\nThere wasn’t a drop of blood on him.\n\nHe tossed my perfectly gray, perfectly dry shirt to me, and I caught it rigidly, nearly too stunned to put it back on. \n\n“What…?” was all I could manage.\n\nMatt shook his head. “I don’t know.”\n\nThe creatures had vanished.\n\nI glanced back to Sam for a moment and, after determining that he was definitely breathing, crossed the floor to the entryway, casting my gaze upward toward the nest. \n\nIt was still there, and the thin, gelatinous substance was still pooling underneath, readying itself for another drip. I couldn’t tell if the creatures were inside or not—there didn’t seem to be any active movement, and no sound escaped it—but I assumed they must be. There wasn’t anywhere else for them to have gone.\n\nFor a fleeting moment, I wanted to ask Matt if he had his lighter. I wanted to take the ladder down from the far wall and climb to the top and set the monsters ablaze while they lay dormant. \n\nBut I didn’t.\n\nTo be perfectly honest, I don’t know why. Maybe because I couldn’t begin to guess what wrath killing them would incur.\n\nOr maybe…well. \n\nI’ve always been a bit of a big-mean-scary-animal-apologist. They’re just trying to survive, you know? Just like the rest of us. Obviously I’m not going to lay down and die, but if something isn’t actively harming me or anyone in my general vicinity, I can’t imagine that wiping it out wouldn’t feel a little like cold blooded murder. And besides, not that I have solid proof, but if I’m going purely off intuition, I truly believe whatever was oozing out of the nest was these creatures’ equivalent to some kind of disgusting amniotic fluid. Sort of feels like Matt shot their mom and now the rest of them are just trying to protect their new baby sibling. \n\nAlso, I really had no way to gauge how well it would’ve gone. They could’ve bitten my head off as soon as I was face to face with them, so I figured it was probably best to let sleeping dogs (or robot-dinosaur-bats) lie.\n\nWhat I *couldn’t* let lie, however, was Sam. Apparently Matt had the same thought, because when I turned back around, he was hauling him up by his armpits, still fully unconscious. \n\n“Here,” I said, rushing over to them. “Let me help.”\n\nMatt maneuvered Sam around so that I could pull his left arm around my shoulders, his right draped over Matt’s, and together we wrangled him down the stairs, slamming the door to the mechanical room securely behind us.\n\nRight on the other side, Wiley was waiting, eyes flitting wildly from Matt to me to Sam. “What the fuck happened?” they demanded.\n\nI wasn’t sure if they meant with the creatures or the time jump or what, so I was grateful when Matt responded, “A lot.”\n\n“Is he…?”\n\n“He’s alive.” I was secure enough in that, at least, to confirm it as fact. “Just knocked the fuck out.”\n\n“Come on,” Matt said, “let’s get him settled down somewhere.”\n\nWe took him out to the children’s area and plopped him onto a bean bag chair, figuring it was the safest bet considering we didn’t trust him to stay upright. It took a lot of light face-slapping and some cold water over the head, but, finally, Sam’s eyes shot open.\n\n“Hey!” I took a step back, afraid I’d startle him if I was standing too close. “Freaked us out for a minute there. Are you all right?”\n\nSam blinked. “Um. Who are you?”\n\n“I’m…Adam,” I reminded him, my stomach begging to instantly fill back up with dread. “You’re at the library. You came to fix our AC. Remember?”\n\nSlowly, Sam’s head turned side to side.\n\nI looked over to Matt.\n\n“It’s okay,” he assured me. “Probably just a concussion. Why don’t you go give his dad a call? Let him know what’s going on? I think I’ve got him from here.”\n\n“Yeah,” I assented, glad to be given an out. “Okay.”\n\nPulling my cell from my pocket as I walked away, I did a quick Google search for *Murphy’s Heating and Air*, double checking that the first result was in the correct area before I hit *‘call’* below the business’s hours, praying it was a personal cell that would still be reachable so late. \n\nAfter the third ring, a gruff voice answered, “Murphy’s.” I waited for a *‘How can I help you?’* or maybe some kind of awful business slogan, but none came.\n\n“Hi,” I started shakily. “Is this, uh…Mr. Murphy?”\n\nA moment of silence (during which time I punched myself in the metaphorical fucking face, because, god, could I not even have bothered to click the Facebook link at the top of the page to try to find his first name?) and then, “I own the joint, ‘f that’s what you mean.”\n\n“Yes,” I said, “okay, yeah. I just wanted to—I’m Adam Ward. I work at the library your son came to service this evening. I’m sure you’re worried sick about him; I know he should’ve been back a long time ago, but I just wanted to let you know that he’s—”\n\n“Billy didn’t take a call this evenin’.”\n\nMy internal dialogue defaulted to the dial-up sound. “Oh, um. Sorry. N-not Billy. Sam.”\n\nAnother pause. Then, “I ain’t got but the one son, boy. Is this some kind’a prank?”\n\nThe dial-up sound grew louder. Just to be sure, I asked if he could confirm the location of his business. \n\nHe did. In quite an irritated manner. \n\n“And there’s not another Murphy’s in the area? That you know of?”\n\n“You got too damn much time on your hands, kid,” he said, and hung up.\n\nI headed back to the children’s area to inform Matt that we had a problem.\n\nWhen I reached him, he said, “We have a problem.”\n\n“I know,” I told him. Then, when my brain caught up, “Wait. Another one?”\n\n“Jesus H. What’s *your* problem?”\n\nI stepped closer to Matt, lowering my voice. “Sam’s dad…doesn’t know who he is.”\n\nMatt laughed, once. There was no humor in it. “Oh, good. I was thinking amnesia, ‘cause my problem was that *Sam* doesn’t know who he is. But I’m glad to hear it’s a whole hell of a lot fuckin’ worse.”\n\nWe did, of course, call an ambulance. And they did, of course, take Sam to the hospital. We told them everything we could (the name he’d given us, why he was at the library in the first place, and that he’d…*hit his head* and couldn’t recall anything, himself included). I’m not sure what their findings were, as they weren’t allowed to disclose any patient information to anyone who wasn’t family, which Sam didn’t seem to have.\n\nWhat I do know, however, is that when he was released, he gave the cab driver the library’s address. \n\nWe waited days—weeks—hoping that we’d somehow contacted the wrong person, that news articles or missing posters would start cropping up, that we’d get a call asking about him from his dad’s *real* company. \n\nNothing.\n\nSo, that’s it. \n\nHe’s one of us now.\n\nHe’s happy enough. Seems to be, anyway. Does whatever he can find that’s not finished; shelves when Horace is out, cleans when Della’s off, works circ when there’s a gap in the schedule. Great customer service. Personable. Friendly.\n\nPlus, Wiley’s got a roommate now. There wasn’t anywhere else for him to go, so, I mean. I don’t feel like I need to explain Matt’s take on strays.\n\nEspecially when he feels like he’s responsible. Like it’s his fault.\n\nI just keep reminding myself that it could’ve turned out worse. He could’ve died. We all could have.\n\nAnd he’s adjusting just fine. No signs whatsoever that he’s starting to remember his old life, or starting to miss it.\n\nThere’s just *one* thing.\n\nEvery once in a while, when he isn’t actively working, or talking, or otherwise engaged, Sam will wander off. \n\nEvery time, I’ve found him.\n\nInside the mechanical room.\n\nJust at the bottom of the stairs.",

Both of us are in university and she comes from a wealthy family that bought us the apparent and pays for all of our bills\n\n We just moved into this apartment so boxes are everywhere. \n\nShe has a dog (9 weeks) that is the love of her life. The dog is a beagle and is quite small. It's so small that it will be barley noticeable right? Wrong apparently. \n\nWhen I woke up to find all my boxers torn to shreds in a massive pile I wasn't too upset. I knew I should have put the box on the counter instead of leaving it on the floor. All of those can be replaced. \n\nWhen the dog took a chunk out of my hair I thought nothing of it. It's a pup. It didn't mean it. It can't resent a human. It can barely run and hops instead, let alone have a hatred for a specific person it comes in contact to right? \n\nI wasn't worried until things started to get more disturbing. \n\nI had a big job interview in the morning that I needed to have a good night sleep for. I did everything to prepare for it. I combed my hair back with gel, I bought a grey suit and a red matching tie. I even got ready a bit if bronzer. I went to bed extremely early and after a bit of tossing and turning. I finally went to sleep. I was rudely interrupted, however, by a loud bang at around three in the morning. When I got up to check the sound, I found our dog ontop of an intruder. I pulled him off while I roared at my girlfriend to call the police. I couldn't get the dog off (mind you it's TINY)\n\nWhen the paramedics got there, it was too late. It took three people to get the dog off the man's face. When we got if off the face was not recognisable. The man was pronounced dead on the seen. \n\nWe went to court with the family and ended up not facing any charges due to the fact he came onto our property. \n\nI was terrified of the dog. I couldn't live with it in the house. I was excused from uni for a few days and couldn't attend the job interview after all. But that's not why I'm writing this.\n\nI got home after the court case was dismisses. I was tierd. The dog came up and snuggled into me while I slept on the couch. The next thing I remember is waking up in the ambulance with paramedics surrounding me. The  dog had ripped my arm off. They couldn't save it. Ontop of that, they had to amputate more if it as the tissue had died. I was distraught. Instead of going to the police or court. I called my local vet and scheduled him to be out down while my girlfriend was at uni. When she came back the deed had already been done. She screamed at me calling me an ahole but I am asking you reddit. AITA?",

        "text": "I am a scientist at a hidden lab in **\\[REDACTED\\]** We expirement on entities from different dimensions and its a interesting job. We are very isolated in this lab and have no signal usually and so our operations are underground. On the very bottom floor of the lab we have a wormhole machine that nobody is allowed to except special engineers, workers etc. None of us know what goes on down there but every second business day we get a new entity every day. These vary from strange humanoid creatures to other types of.. things that are different. There aren’t much words to describe these things but we have to study them, investigate on them and other things that I cannot disclose. When the jails are full the prisoners are sent here to suffer. Even if they were to escape they couldn’t get far as the freezing tempetures (-10 degrees Celsius) make it impossible. Their purpose is to get experimented on and die, most of our entities are very aggressive. This week I was assigned to experiment on a entity called a “Skin Stealer.” I have named this entity this because from my research they eat flesh when hungered. From an expirement i ran. They are tall humanoid like creatures. They can mimic human speech. Occasionally it repeats what the prisoner said before it was feasted on. Their blood is also transparent. After discovering that last bit of info i headed to the lounge for a break. I was watching the World Cup Final on the television when the lights went out. Me and Max were confused. Max was my friend who worked in the lab and he also experimented  on entities aswell. He was also telling me about his entity who he named “Crunch“ apparently he can sprint faster then Usain Bolt and feasts on humans, He hasn’t done more research then that.\n\nThe lights were cutoff and then an alarm started blaring. The red emergency lights were switched on and the lights were flashing. According to the lab rules we had to wait until they announced the problem. About 15 seconds later an announcement came off from the speaker.\n\n**“THIS IS A ENTITY BREACH. TRUCKS ARE BEING PREPARED AND PLANES”**\n\nThis meant we had to run as fast as we could to a jet to transport staff members to The nearest country. Me and Max opened the door from the canteen. The lights were flashing and the alarm was blaring louder then in the room. There was heavy gun fire going on and screams off terror. More men in armed black armour suits were sprinting down the hall. On this hall where the canteen was located was pretty darn long. There were at least 10 rooms of staffs quarters this was the place we came to relax. We looked down the hall and saw bodies and blood was splattered on the doors, there was a massive puddle of blood and a scientists body and a guard trying to shoot the entity with his handgun. He was a floor guard, just a regular security guard but the men in the black armoured suits were armed with MP4s and hand grenades. There were 5 of them. The other stairwell leading up to the lab floor was shut off to prevent anymore entities from entering the floor. One of the guards ordered us to run. We sprinted up the stairwell leading to the outside. While i was running up, i heard a blood curdling scream come from behind me. I turned around to see my dear friend getting grabbed in the dimly lit hall, where it smelt like blood,sweat and smoke. My Skinwalker grabbed him and took a massive bite of his ear. Blood splatted on my lab jacket, i muttered a quiet sorry and adrenaline made me run so fast i was on the top floor nearest the exit almost immediately. When i came out there was automatic gunfire and prisoners lined up to exit to the trucks. The guards surrounded the staff exit. I exited and safely boarded the plane. I let out a soft sob for my friend.\n\n15 Minutes later they announced that we would be taking off we hurdled off the arctic runway and as we were lifting off the ground there was a massive explosion and the lab was destroyed. Gone. My entire life and career was destroyed in a flash.\n\nAfter safely touching down in Buenos Aires we were directed to a hotel where we stayed until our flights to our native homes were done. I was the only one flying to Ireland. After about a week of silence i got an email, it read\n\n**Greetings Mr O’Brien.**\n\nI am afraid your job at our lab has been terminated. A staff member smashed all the glass cages somehow and released them all, causing pandemonium and we had to demolish our lab in Antartica via nano thermite. We have sent you all a 5000$ reduncy fee. Any history of you working here has been erased.\n\nThank you for your work,\n\nArtur Jackson.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter that i opened my bank account and I saw a one cent transfer with a note attached.\n\nDear Mr O’Brien, we saw what you have done. That thermite explosion was you, who detonated the lab and i know it was you who called the UN to inform them about our illegal expiermentation. For this we have to punish you, thank you for your work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFuck, they scanned my pockets and saw the matches, i think my facial expression gave it away aswell. I am writing this now because i heard a knock at my door. Please…pray for me.",

        "text": " \n\nAs I walk through the school hall, I feel like I'm the only one here. Everyone else is in their own little groups, talking and laughing. I feel like an outsider, like I don't belong.\n\nI look around, but nothing catches my eye. The walls are plain and the floor is dull. There's nothing interesting here. I keep walking, my footsteps echoing off the walls.\n\nI pass by a few groups of people, but they don't even notice me. I'm just another face in the crowd. I feel invisible, like no one even knows I exist.\n\nI keep walking, my head down and my hands in my pockets. I'm just trying to get through this day without being noticed. I don't want to draw any attention to myself.\n\nI had been hearing voices in my head for weeks now, but this time it was different. The voices were louder and more insistent. I could feel them in my head, like a buzzing that wouldn't go away. I tried to ignore the voices, but they kept getting louder and more insistent. I stopped in the middle of the hallway, looking around to make sure no one was watching me. I closed my eyes and tried to focus on the voices, trying to make out what they were saying.\n\nIt was a deep, commanding voice that said, \"Take a sh\\*t in your best friend's backpack.\" I was taken aback by the suggestion and immediately dismissed it. I knew it was wrong and I had no intention of following through with it.\n\n\"You must do as I say or you will suffer the consequences.\" I felt a chill run down my spine as I realized what was happening. The voice persisted. It kept repeating the same phrase \"Take a sh\\*t in your best friend's backpack.\" over and over again, growing louder and more insistent with each repetition. I tried to ignore it, but it was impossible. I felt like I was being pulled in two directions, and I was starting to feel overwhelmed. Finally, I gave in. I took a deep breath and walked inside the class.\n\nThe classroom was silent as everyone worked diligently on their assignments. Suddenly, a loud, unmistakable sound filled the room. It was the sound of someone taking a sh\\*t. Everyone turned to see who it was, and to their horror, they saw that it was me.\n\nThe entire class was silent, and I could feel everyone's eyes on me. I was embarrassed and ashamed of my actions .\n\nI can't believe I did this. I'm running away from class. I can feel my heart pounding in my chest as I sprint out of the classroom and down the hallway. I can hear the teacher calling after me, but I don't stop. I keep running until I'm out of the school and into the safety of the street. I take a few moments to catch my breath and try to calm down. I know I have to go back eventually, but for now I just need to get away.\n\nI was walking home from school, feeling a little bit guilty about what I had done. I had taken a sh\\*t in my friend's backpack!, and I knew I was going to get in trouble for it.\n\n When I got home, my dad was waiting for me. I was so embarrassed as I stood there in front of my dad, feeling the heat of his anger radiating off of him. He had just gotten off the phone with my school principal, who had informed him of my latest misdeed.\n\n My dad was livid. He was shouting at me, telling me how disappointed he was in me and how I had embarrassed him and our family. He said that he had worked hard to build a good reputation for us, and that I had just thrown it away with my childish behavior. I wanted to explain myself, to tell him that it was just a joke and that I hadn't meant any harm, but I knew it wouldn't make a difference. He was too angry to listen.\n\n  Finally, after what felt like an eternity, my dad stopped yelling and just looked at me and said, \"Go to your room and stay there until I say otherwise.\" I nodded, feeling ashamed and embarrassed. I knew I had messed up.\n\n I open the door to my room and take a deep breath. It's been a long day and I'm ready to relax. I take a few steps in and take in the familiar sight of my room. My bed is made, my desk is neat, and my bookshelf is full of books. I can't help but smile. This is my sanctuary. I walk over to my bed and lay down.\n\nSuddenly, I hear a voice in my head. It's faint, but it's there. \"What do you want?\" I ask, my voice barely above a whisper. The voice doesn't answer, but I can feel its presence. I can feel it watching me, waiting for me to speak. \"What do you want from me?\" I ask again, this time a little louder. The voice still doesn't answer, but I can feel it getting closer. I can feel its presence in the room, like a presence that can't be seen but can be felt. I take a deep breath and close my eyes. I focus on the voice, trying to make out what it's saying. \"I want you to be happy,\" the voice finally says. I was taken aback by the voice's response.\n\nI had expected it to be angry or dismissive, but it was neither.\n\nThe voice was silent again, then it said, \"You must steal your father's car and go meet me in the forest\". \"Why do I need to do this?\" I ask the voice. The voice responds, \"It is the only way. Do not hesitate, do it now!\"\n\nI'm lying in bed, my mind racing with ideas. I can't believe I'm actually considering stealing my dad's car. I know it's wrong, but I'm desperate. I glance at the clock. It's almost midnight. I know my dad will be asleep by now, so I should be able to get away with it. I take a deep breath and get out of bed. I'm going to do this. I crept out of my room and down the stairs.\n\nMy dad kept his car keys in the top drawer of his desk, so i snuck into his office and opened the drawer. I grabbed the keys and quickly ran out of the room, feeling a rush of adrenalin. I was shaking with excitement and fear as I opened the garage door.\n\nI had never driven a car before, but I figured it couldn't be too hard. I got in the driver's seat. I turned the key in the ignition and the engine roared to life. I was off! I slowly put my foot on the gas pedal and the car started to move.\n\nI was driving down the highway, my hands gripping the steering wheel tightly as I tried to focus on the road ahead. Suddenly, a voice in my head spoke up, startling me. \"Turn left at the next intersection,\" it said. \"Turn left,\" it repeated, this time with more urgency. My heart raced as I slowly turned the wheel, following the voice's instructions.\n\nI glanced in the rearview mirror, expecting to see someone following me, but there was no one there. The voice continued to guide me, telling me when to turn and when to speed up. I felt like I was in a trance, unable to control my own actions.\n\n Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the voice stopped. I pulled over to the side of the road, my hands shaking. I had no idea where I was or how I had gotten there. All I knew was that I had been driven there by a mysterious voice in my head.\n\nI stepped out of the car and were immediately surrounded by a thick fog that seemed to be coming from nowhere. I looked around but couldn't see more than a few feet in front of me.\n\nI was walking through the forest, feeling the cool breeze on my skin and the crunch of the leaves beneath my feet. Suddenly, I heard a voice in my head. It was deep and menacing, and it said, \"Go deeper into the forest. You will find what you seek.\" I hesitated, feeling a chill run down my spine. I wanted to turn around and run away, but something compelled me to keep going.\n\nThe voice in my head kept talking, guiding me through the trees. It told me to turn left, then right, then left again. I followed its instructions, feeling a strange sense of dread as I went.\n\n Finally, I reached a clearing in the forest. In the center of the clearing was a large, ancient temple. The voice in my head said, \"This is the way. Go inside and you will find what you seek.\" I can feel the power emanating from the structure, as if it has been here for centuries. I take a few steps closer and run my hand along the cold stone. I can almost feel the history of the temple, and I'm filled with a sense of reverence.\n\nI took a deep breath and stepped inside.\n\nPart 2 is coming soon.",

        "text": "\\- \"So, Mr. Lebrun, big day today. How are you feeling?\"\n\n\\- \"Pretty well, I think. A bit afraid.\"\n\n\\- \"I understand that. Heart valve surgery is not to be taken lightly, general nervousness is a natural reaction. But we've been over the discussion of the details, and I assure you: Here at Mount Sinai Hospital, you're in the best hands.\"\n\nDr. Levin smiles at the elderly man on the operating table.\n\n\\- \"You already met the lovely Miss Sophie Geller, who will administer the anaesthesia, and not to forget\" - he points in my direction - \"my fellow assistant here, Dr. Abramowicz, who will perform the bulk of the operation by himself.\"\n\n\\- \"Good afternoon, Sir\", I say without looking up.\n\n\\- \"Abramowicz, you say?\", the patient asks upon mustering me. \"Is there a possibility we know each other?\"\n\n\\- \"That would surprise me\", I reply. \"I don't think I have had the pleasure. How long have you already been in New York, if I may ask?\"\n\nMr. Lebrun frowns. \"About two years. I came here after my daughter got married. Why?\"\n\n\\- \"Oh, I was just curious. A lot of people come here, not only locals but international clients as well. Somewhat hard to keep track on the faces, so I hope you don't mind.\"\n\n\\- \"Very well, very well. Past 3 o'clock already. Shall we begin?\", my boss interrupts.\n\n\\- \"Where's the rest of the staff?\"\n\n\\- \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\\- \"I was under the impression you'd need a lot more surgeons for an operation of such importance\", Mr. Lebrun says, seemingly bewildered.\n\n\\- \"You'll have to excuse, Sir\", I respond, \"we have been sort of short-staffed all week. But I assure you this will not diminish the quality or safety of this procedure.\"\n\n\\- \"I'll have to take your word for it. Fine.\"\n\n\\- \"Alright. Now relax, Mr. Lebrun. The anaesthetic should take some time.\"\n\nThe patient leans back and slowly closes his eyes. Seconds pass. Sophie empties the needle, throws it away and smirks. \"He's all yours, doctor.\"\n\nI step to the operation table and whisper into the patient's ear: \"Tell me, Mr. Lebrun, do you believe in God?\"\n\nThe look of surprise on his face is delicious.\n\n\\- \"I, for myself, have always found it difficult to believe. But if there's a God, I should be damn grateful\", I say, glancing at the calendar. \"For today, Wednesday, the 23rd of September 1964, is the happiest day in my life. This is the day I cut you open, rip your heart out, eviscerate you and extract every single of your organs that might be good for anything before tossing your worthless body away and erasing you from this earth. That's what I'm going to do now, you old fuck.\"\n\nThe man's eyes fill with fear. It must have occured to him that he can still hear me.\n\n\\- \"And the best part of it? You will be awake for the most of it. You don't think we actually induced narcosis, do you? Thanks to Sophie here slipping you a strong muscle relaxant instead, you won't be able to move, you won't be able to scream, yet you're going to feel all of it. Every. Single. Cut.\n\nBut from doctor to doctor: You would be proud of me right now, wouldn't you?\"\n\nMr. Lebruns eyes dart around in panic, but all he can do is slowly open his mouth, unable to mutter a syllable.\n\n\\- \"I might have lied to you previously. We do, in fact, know each other. It's been 20 years, give or take, but I recognized you the moment you stepped through our hospital door for your first appointment. Nice job you did with the beard. And Lebrun? A French name? Creative. But I know your name, Doctor. Your soulless eyes gave you away.\"\n\nThe patient now lies completely motionless, only his soulless eyes growing in size.\n\n\\- \"'He can't do that, can he?', you must be thinking right now. 'He can't just murder a patient on the table like that? His colleagues would intervene immediately!' - Don't worry. I told the others I recognized you the day you came in, and when Dr. Levin found out he was the one scheduled for your heart surgery, he himself offered me supervision of the whole thing. My fellows are totally in on it.\"\n\nGod, this is making me giddy, I'm almost dropping the vascular clamps.\n\n\\- \"Oh, the family, you say? 'My family would immediately raise questions about an otherwise healthy 53-year-old suddenly dying from a procedure with 2% fatality rate? The coroner would definitely investigate!' - Eugene is a good guy. If I tell him he didn't notice anything out of order about your death, then he didn't. It's really easy. If all of the staff knew you were here, at least half of them would want you dead. But if we keep it secret, even better.\"\n\nA single tear rolls down the paralyzed man's cheek.\n\n\\- \"Ah, great, now you're crying. Well guess who cried as you surgically removed his eye? The one with the colour shift?\" I shout, pointing at my glass eye. \"For 'scientific reasons'? \\*Without painkillers of any fucking sorts?\"\\*\n\nDr. Levin clears his throat. \"Sorry to interrupt your big moment, old chap, but we don't have all day. You still want to do this or not?\"\n\n\\- \"Sorry. I'm getting worked up. Two more minutes and we can begin.\"\n\n\\- \"Alright then, take your time\", he says and lights a cigarette. \"Take your time.\"\n\n\\- \"So, where was I? Right. You might be asking yourself why I, of all people, am doing this to you. I'm doing this for my father whose hand I held as he starved away. I'm doing this for my brother I last saw as you took him into your lab, promising him sweets if he would sit still like a good little boy. I'm doing this for my mother who arrived at the camp with a bad cold only for you to send her into the 'showers' without batting an eye. And I'm doing this for the countless and countless others.\"\n\nI pick up the scalpel with a big grin.\n\n\\- \"See you in hell, Doctor Mengele.\"",

I can feel its presence in the room, like a presence that can't be seen but can be felt. I take a deep breath and close my eyes. I focus on the voice, trying to make out what it's saying. \"I want you to be happy,\" the voice finally says. I was taken aback by the voice's response.\n\nI had expected it to be angry or dismissive, but it was neither.\n\nThe voice was silent again, then it said, \"You must steal your father's car and go meet me in the forest\". \"Why do I need to do this?\" I ask the voice. The voice responds, \"It is the only way. Do not hesitate, do it now!\"\n\nI'm lying in bed, my mind racing with ideas. I can't believe I'm actually considering stealing my dad's car. I know it's wrong, but I'm desperate. I glance at the clock. It's almost midnight. I know my dad will be asleep by now, so I should be able to get away with it. I take a deep breath and get out of bed. I'm going to do this. I crept out of my room and down the stairs. \n\nMy dad kept his car keys in the top drawer of his desk, so i snuck into his office and opened the drawer. I grabbed the keys and quickly ran out of the room, feeling a rush of adrenalin. I was shaking with excitement and fear as I opened the garage door.\n\nI had never driven a car before, but I figured it couldn't be too hard. I got in the driver's seat. I turned the key in the ignition and the engine roared to life. I was off! I slowly put my foot on the gas pedal and the car started to move.\n\nI was driving down the highway, my hands gripping the steering wheel tightly as I tried to focus on the road ahead. Suddenly, a voice in my head spoke up, startling me. \"Turn left at the next intersection,\" it said. \"Turn left,\" it repeated, this time with more urgency. My heart raced as I slowly turned the wheel, following the voice's instructions. \n\nI glanced in the rearview mirror, expecting to see someone following me, but there was no one there. The voice continued to guide me, telling me when to turn and when to speed up. I felt like I was in a trance, unable to control my own actions.\n\n Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the voice stopped. I pulled over to the side of the road, my hands shaking. I had no idea where I was or how I had gotten there. All I knew was that I had been driven there by a mysterious voice in my head.\n\nI stepped out of the car and were immediately surrounded by a thick fog that seemed to be coming from nowhere. I looked around but couldn't see more than a few feet in front of me.\n\nI was walking through the forest, feeling the cool breeze on my skin and the crunch of the leaves beneath my feet. Suddenly, I heard a voice in my head. It was deep and menacing, and it said, \"Go deeper into the forest. You will find what you seek.\" I hesitated, feeling a chill run down my spine. I wanted to turn around and run away, but something compelled me to keep going. \n\nThe voice in my head kept talking, guiding me through the trees. It told me to turn left, then right, then left again. I followed its instructions, feeling a strange sense of dread as I went.\n\n Finally, I reached a clearing in the forest. In the center of the clearing was a large, ancient temple. The voice in my head said, \"This is the way. Go inside and you will find what you seek.\" I can feel the power emanating from the structure, as if it has been here for centuries. I take a few steps closer and run my hand along the cold stone. I can almost feel the history of the temple, and I'm filled with a sense of reverence.\n\n I took a deep breath and stepped inside.\n\nPart 2 is coming soon.",

        "text": "It must have been the early morning hours when the knock at my bedroom door came. Poppy often got scared when a storm raged outside, even though the blackout blinds we had in all the rooms helped to muffle the sound of them somewhat. On top of the chest infection she was getting over, which had resulted in many restless nights - the request to slip into my bed was no surprise. Her voice was husky and unstable, making me wince at how deep the virus was in her lungs. I’d dismissed her sniffly nose and pleas to turn up the heating when she got home from school.\n\nThings had been particularly tight going into the winter months after her father had left us with no warning to pursue a new relationship on the south coast. All our joint accounts had been drained and what little I had left in my personal accounts went on affording a mortgage that was too large for a work-from-home single parent. Luckily we’d stopped at one child, although I’d pushed hard to give Poppy a sibling.\n\nHer toes felt like little stubs of ice as they brushed against my shins, sending shivers up my hamstrings and into my spine. Fingers gripped tight around my waist, digging into the bare flesh on my back. This a reminder that her nails were due for a trim in the morning.\n\nI stroked stray hair behind her ear, feeling the outline of her jaw as my fingers trailed down her soft brown locks. Seeing through touch, the blackout blinds did earn their name. Without a nightlight, it was nearly impossible to even see your hand in front of your face in the middle of the night. After having them for the better part of the year now, it was the only way I could sleep.\n\nHollow breaths slowly eased to gentle puffs as I felt Poppy’s body ease and release, slipping back into a deep sleep that brought her dreams of freedom and the sublime. I pulled her in tight once more before letting my mind drift off to happier places, somewhere that included her.\n\nJust as my world started to pass over into an altogether dreamier realm, I was startled by a knock at the door. As I lifted my head from the pillow, a soft croaky voice whispered from the doorway.\n\n“Mummy”.\n\nChills navigated down my spine at lightning speed as I realised the body wrapped around mine was not my daughter. Tiny icy fingers dug themselves into my back as I instinctively shifted away.\n\n“Can I sleep with you? I’m feeling scared”.\n\nMy heart started to thud in my ears, distracting me from the hoarse and gurgly breath I could feel on my bare chest, getting faster and more animalistic as small cold arms tightened further.\n\n“Go back to bed, Poppy. Please”, I whimpered as gently as I could as my daughter stood silhouetted faintly in the doorway.\n\nFootsteps gently padded back into her bedroom, with a few huffs and sniffles along the way. Slowly the icy fingers loosened on my back, and a steady yet gurgly breath returned. \n\nWe stayed entwined until the early morning hours when I could faintly hear the songbirds atop neighbouring homes. My body was tense, eyes wide open, aware of every shifting movement between us. Eventually, the small arctic body released its grasp on me, slipped out of bed and slumbered out of my room and down the hallway, the floorboards creaking less with each step taken until the house was filled with silence.",

        "text": "  \n\n“Why on earth would anyone want to sit out on that cold ice all day just to catch a bluegill?” my dad used to always say. \n\nTo be fair, I agreed with him for a long time. We would posture with each other about how we just didn’t like being cold just to catch a puny fish but in reality, our macho-headedness wouldn’t allow us to admit that we were actually afraid. My dad had good reason. His best friend’s father fell through the ice one time and darn-near ripped is fingernails off just trying to get back up to safety. As a kid, anything that scares your dad… your 6ft+, broad shouldered, invincible dad, will also scare you. \n\nFast forward to today and I can’t stay off the ice. It started with a friend asking me to go fishing with him. As a 27 year old man from the country, there is no way I could admit fear. In fact, I met this friend in the weight room. I couldn’t let my trepidation of falling through the ice shatter the tough guy façade of a muscle-bound gym bro. It turned out to be a great time. The anticipation of a fishing swimming right below your feet under the solid barrier of ice and inhaling your lure or bait was the perfect excuse to get out of the house when things are at their most dull during the winter. \n\nAs with all outdoor activities, there’s always a certain indescribable mystique that surrounds you when you’re on the ice. Sitting in the middle of a barren, snow-blown lake allows you to be very aware of the harsh surroundings. I had a rule for a long time to only go ice fishing if I had a partner. The dangers abound: falling through the ice, flash blizzards, wrecking on the unkempt back roads, etc. As life goes, friends got busy, and I started going solo against my better judgement. \n\nI couldn’t tell you why I decided to go to the lake I did that day. Every other lake in the county would have had at the very least one other angler to give me some semblance of safety. I guess I just wanted to be alone. I pulled into the parking lot knowing that it would be empty and gathered all my equipment in my sled. I trekked out to a familiar weed line and drilled a few holes. Hours ticked by but not a single bite. \n\nI listened to the wind howling over the ridge top as it passed through the massive windmills that were cool to me as a kid but now were simply an eyesore on every mountain. The lake was in a valley and the mounts reached to the sky in every direction, almost like stands in a sports stadium As the day went on, the temperature dropped slowly, and the wind brought in light flurries that turned to a steady snow. I switched to a lure that I could work with some vigor just to try and keep my hands warm as my fingertips were now starting to sting as the cold worked its way through my winter gloves. \n\nI was so supremely focused on the action I was imparting on my lure that I never saw him walk out on the ice. As I was reaching for my thermos to take a swig of hot coffee, I noticed him standing on the opposite side of the lake. It wasn’t an altogether odd occurrence that he made it on the ice without me noticing. I was, after all, pretty deep in thought and focus. The first thing that struck me about him was how he just stared at me. It was almost like I could feel him looking into my eyes even though he was a quarter mile away. \n\nI shook my head and wondered why it had bothered me so much. I often stared at other people when out fishing too. Mostly to see if they were catching anything but also just because boredom sets in incredibly fast if you’re not having any action. I was more than likely already on edge because of my continued fear of falling through the ice anyways. I went back to focusing on my fish sonar and waited for a bite. \n\nThe wind blew harder and to counter the uncomfortableness I reached in my sled for the best part of the trip. I pulled out one of those Little Debbie Christmas Tree cakes and began to unwrap it. I wait all year for those sweet diet bombs to come out and horde them once they do. As I sat, munching on my cake, I looked around at the increasing volume of snow falling from the sky. That’s when I realized he had moved. Not only closer to me but also closer to the woods line. Almost like he was trying to get behind me. Although the sun was low and the overcast sky made it seem an hour later than it really was, I could still see him staring directly at me. His silhouette was getting lost in the darkness of the woods but I could make out that he was a thinner man with a slight hunch. \n\nAny misgivings I had of comfort were now shattered. I immediately started packing up. I wasn’t trying to rush, as I knew he was looking my way and I didn’t want things to escalate any higher. I couldn’t help but look over my shoulder and that’s when I saw him on a full out sprint over the ice. I said ‘to hell’ with my gear and started running myself. You move very slow on the ice, much like in a dream, especially when you’re weighed down with a full snowsuit on. I was full blown panicking at this point and wishing that I was a bit more like every other redneck in my town and carrying a pistol. Unfortunately, mine was safely in a lock box at home. \n\nI had my eyes peeled on my truck in the parking lot and realized there wasn’t another car there. This meant that he must have been from one of the 3 or 4 cabins that were up on the mountainside tucked in the woods. I didn’t know if he wasn’t happy that I was on “his” lake or if he was just a nut. Either way, I had to look back and see how close he was. He was gaining, and fast, because he was only in a flannel and jeans. Although he had to have been freezing, he was also less weighed down and was moving much more agile than I. \n\nAs my feel left the ice and hit the ramp, I could now hear his breathing behind me off in the distance. He was close but I felt comfortable enough that I would make it to the truck in time. Just as I slammed the door and threw it in reverse, he full body checked my passenger side door. Both his hand slapped at my window as he screamed at me as if in a manic episode.  His eyes did not change from the same cold stare and I completely froze for a moment looking directly at him. I quickly snapped back and peeled out of the lot. The roads were now snow covered and I fishtailed a bit but ultimately was out of harms way as he faded into my side view mirror. I slowed down as to not wreck and was able to gather my thoughts a bit. It was then I realized what he was screaming at me during our close encounter.\n\n“You have to leave before dark! It comes out at dark! You’re not safe! You’re not safe! You’re not safe!”\n\nThere is plenty of undiagnosed mental heath cases in Appalachia. The people are remote and healthcare, especially mental healthcare, isn’t always readily available. There is also a deep history of supernatural happenings and beings in the mountains. I’ve been going back and forth all night trying to figure out if that man was an unfortunate victim of a mental health crisis or a concerned local who was trying to protect me. I’m not sure where I land at the moment, but I have to say, my curiosity is getting the better of me.",
