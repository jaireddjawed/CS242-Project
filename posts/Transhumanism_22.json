        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/transhumanism/comments/6i895a/on_the_subject_of_the_cloned_transhumanposthuman/",
        "text": "\nI recently had the pleasure of running across a post that elicited a response from a number of people.  One of the comments pointed out that it is necessary to start considering the complex issues that revolve around transhumanism.  This comment pointed out a number of conundrums that will arise if we fail to address the issues until it is too late.  My favorite and, in my opinion, the most thought-provoking on his list was that of voting rights for a cloned mind.\n\n \n\n                I think that it is important to differentiate here the two most likely scenarios that would result in a cloned mind.  This is important as each will include separate assumptions.  Though those assumptions may be inaccurate, they are all we have of the future; we can move past those assumptions once this moves from possibility to reality.\n\n \n\nThe first possibility is that a mind is cloned by digital means.  In this case, some sort of neural mapping consisting of firing patterns and existing connections would be duplicated in the form of a digital code.  For this reason, I’ll refer to it as the digitally-cloned mind.  An important aspect of a digitally-cloned mind is that, due to its nature, it would likely be capable of processing vast amount of digital data (assumption).  There is no telling whether that sort of mind would require a physical body, but that speculation can be left for another time as it is outside the topic of this post.\n\n \n\n                The second possibility revolves around a more organic method where connections of an individual’s brain are replicated through a bio-printing process (or alternative method that the future holds) where an identical firing pattern is induced, rather than encoded.  I would argue that this organically-cloned mind would not be capable of the same things as that of a digitally-cloned mind due to the limitations of biology.  The neurons will only be capable of processing a limited amount of data in addition to the limitations faced by focus, concentration, and duration (due to sleep).  Alternatively, a digital mind is limited only by its available memory and hardware; these limitations could likely be alleviated by increasing hardware or connecting to a server of some sort.\n\n \n\nWhichever method is used, the initial result is still the same: a cloned mind.  At the exact moment that the information is copied, there will be no difference between the two.  So, do they have equal rights as today’s Homo sapiens?  Should they all have the right to vote?\n\n \n\nI think we can apply much of today’s current standards for voting rights in this situation, though not in the sense that may immediately come to mind.  To propose this, I would like to focus briefly on who has the right to vote in the United States (because those are simply the rights that I am familiar with).  If you are from somewhere else and your rights are different and you feel that the difference in them would alter the premise of my argument, please let me know.\n\n \n\nIn the US, we are allowed to vote at 18.  This is the same age where it is legal for us to smoke. Drinking comes at 21.  18 is also the age at which we first become available to be drafted into the military.  At 18, we are considered an adult, can be held fully accountable for our actions, and have more financial possibilities open up to us.  It is around this age that most will graduate from high school.\n\n \n\nIt seems that the right to vote comes at an age when our government (and therefore society) has deemed us capable of making rational decisions.  I think that it is fair to say that the assumption of us being capable of taking on the responsibility of making decisions that will affect our health and future is largely due to both experience and education.  By finishing high school, we have learned the basics necessary to function in society.  By the age of 18, we have likely had a number of experiences that have shaped who we are, exposed us to different views, challenged and perhaps changed our beliefs, etc.  As humans we have no way to truly measure experience and very poor ways (standardized testing) to measure our knowledge.  But, in the US, we say most people will have accumulated a sufficient amount of both of these things by age 18 and are capable of deciding what to do with their body and who to vote for.\n\n \n\nIn a transhuman/posthuman era, where minds are able to be cloned, I feel that it is safe to say measuring these things (experience and education) will be VERY feasible, especially with a digitally-cloned mind.  The purpose of this post is not to argue a specific amount of any measurement, but rather to argue the idea of shifting from a primitive determination method, such as using age, to a more advanced method, such as data accumulation.  This may not be entirely possible with an organically-cloned mind. In this case, other methods will need to be devised, but portions of the coming argument will still apply.\n\n \n\nI mentioned earlier that at the exact moment a clone mind is complete it is identical to the original; however, it will not remain this way.  From the moment of completion onward, those two minds will begin to diverge.  As a side note, I would like to point out that any argument against this consisting of a way in which digital clone minds are encoded or instructed to follow the exact thought processes and experiences as the original mind does not represent the production of free agents.  These are not clones, but backups, operating without free will or agency.\n\n \n\n                It would be immoral to remove all rights from ANY self-aware and free mind.  However, it would be unjust to allow anyone to clone their mind any number of times the day before election day and give each of those minds an equal vote as anyone else. \n\n \n\nMy proposition:  Any cloned mind, until the point of potential divergence, as measured by an amount of analyzed data (experience and education) equal to the amount deemed to be of enough value to POTENTIALLY result in divergence and allow different perspectives, will be given a single whole vote.  This vote will be divided equally among all minds and must be cast separately.  As each mind clone reaches the amount of required data (they may not all process data at the same rate due to the focus of each), they will be given their own whole vote, and the remainder who have not reached that point will redistribute their previous shared vote, calculating in one less clone. \n\n \n\n                The thought behind this is that it is our life experience that shapes us and allows us to make decisions and form opinions.  Exposure to the same thing, with the same history, will result in the same outcome.  So, if a clone is expected to expose itself to at least some level of different experiences, it will form a unique perspective.  Whether or not this perspective is the same as that of its “siblings” is of no concern.  Chances are that those you associate with are like-minded and will have many of the same opinions. To deny a clone of someone’s mind, or even a clone of a cloned mind, the opportunity and freedom to vote after experiencing different situations just because they have the same opinion would be equivalent to preventing twins who share the same opinion from voting separately.\n\n \n\n                I hope that this perspective proves to at least be thought provoking and can generate a decent discussion.  I’m sure that it is far from perfect, as I am coming at it from only my point of view.  Do you see any flaws to this?  Any problems with the underlying premise?",

If you hold an idea for, let's say 30 years, you probably won't change it – generally speaking.\n\nOther thing that goes into this path is, for instance, upgrading the human brain with better memory. How always remembering everything would affect our personality? \n\nOr, like, how upgrading your brain so that you become, like, a super smart person, would affect your personality? \n\nThis kinda of thing I guess..",

        "text": "That is where I think people may be wrong. The brain is highly complex, but more than anything it is *optimized* and *compact*. In the research I have done into psychology, I have realized that our brains are a lot more lazy than we think, and are more often making things up than doing complex \"biological calculations\".\n\nFor instance, when asked what we liked about a party, we don't actually know, we just give a general reason based on what we think we should have liked about the party. \n\nTranslated to computer terms, instead of doing complex algorithms to figure out what an AI liked about a party, a more human-like representation would be to put something random out of a small database on parties. \n\nHowever, I guess the real difficult part is figuring out *whether the AI actually liked the party*. In the present moment, how should they feel, based on their environment and personality? But again, this tends to be a lot more simple than we think. If it wasn't, then manipulation wouldn't exist. \n\nI feel like mental illnesses are in some way related to what I'm trying to say here, [autistic spectrum disorders being a prime example](https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/66vx0s/it_feels_like_im_a_mute_using_a_texttospeech/?st=j3zzufdg&amp;sh=a5251df9) (the strength of artificial intelligence basically has a negative correlation with \"displaying symptoms of autism\"). Especially in how they seem to fail at general living, but have an unnatural talent for a very specific area, almost exactly like a computer program. I think this is relevant because I'm guessing **those who program AI are prioritizing high in correctness and low in optimization, basically pumping out savants**. ",

During our usual Skype calls we decided to share our favourite songs. I showed them some of the electronic music, mainly trance (Tiesto, LCD etc.) and they liked it. Then I told them that it was h+ movement that introduced me to this kind of stuff. Again, they never heard about it before. \n\nNow, this is where it gets interesting. The Chad said it was mainly pseudoscientific bullshit and a lot of content is hyped, timelines are too optimistic etc. My other friend, however, got hooked. He started playing a lot of Mirrors Edge, recently bought Binary Domain, Deus Ex. We began to talk about gene eng., cybernetics a lot.\n\nI think one of the appelas of this movement is giving hope for brighter future? Honestly, I kind of dislike it, because this gives a pass to so many sensationalist articles. Remember Zoltan Istvann? And his bullshit interview where he just opened a door with chip implanted in his finger? Remember that video about some overobsessed guy who consumed over 10 different pills daily to enchance his abilities? This is what makes us look like retards. ",
