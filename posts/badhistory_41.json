        "text": "So I was browsing that Kevin Burns AMA and found this:\n&gt; I have to say, even that theory is very interesting, because it's based off the fact that the Phoenicians - which were known to be a big, big seafaring merchant class, with big ships sailing around the Mediterranean, one of their cities was Carthage, and Carthaginian coins have been documented as being found in Northern Canada within the last 20 years. And these Carthaginian coins are from about 500 BC, and these coins lend credibility to the idea that the ancient Phoenicians may have been able to cross the Atlantic, so it's possible that theory might be credible. \n\n\n And I thought, huh, that seems....off. And a quick google search proved me right. Apparently, while Carthaginian coins *have* been found in North America, Wikipedia says: \"Reports of the discovery of putative Carthaginian coins in North America are based on modern replicas, that may have been buried at sites from Massachusetts to Nebraska in order to confuse and mislead archaeological investigation.\" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Columbian_trans-oceanic_contact). So, likely then, they didn't actually find it at all. Further, another Wikipedia page (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_Phoenician_discovery_of_the_Americas), calls the entire thing a \"fringe theory\", and from the looks of it most of their evidence was fabricated. So, I don't know, maybe if a quick wikipedia search disproves what you're trying to say, then maybe it's not a good theory??\n\n\n\n",

They aren't, the first Geneva Convention treaty was signed in 1864. The next treaty in the line of the Geneva Conventions was signed in 1906, and the last one before World War Two was signed in 1929. The most recent Geneva Convention treaty was signed after World War Two in 1949.\n\n&gt;Yeah, I read the Wikipedia article too.\n\nClearly you didn't or you would have known that what I had stated above would be true.\n\n&gt;The first three treaties in question were largely void between the Allied and Axis powers of the war because of the fall of the German and Russian Empires\n\nNever mind that the German Empire had been all but dissolved by the Treaty of Versailles in 1918, and that the Dominance of the Soviets in Russia had been firmly solidified by 1921. All well before the signing of the 1929 Geneva Convention.\n\n&gt;Hell, one of the major reasons for the second world war was Germany flagrantly violating one of those treaties!\n\nAnd finally we come to the worst bad history in this post. This is a logical fallacy pure and simple. The Geneva Conventions apply to the treatment of civilians, non-combatants, and prisoners of war during a time of war. \"The Geneva Conventions extensively defined the basic, wartime rights of prisoners (civil and military); established protections for the wounded; and established protections for the civilians in and around a war-zone.\" How Hitler could violate a treaty that pertains to the conduct of war when there is no war going on is well beyond my knowledge.\n\nEdit: And now we have this.\n\n&gt;The Geneva Convention as we apply them today did not exist at the time in history when this game, predominantly, takes place and thus would not have been a factor of concern for a pilot engaged in the conflict under the name of the Geneva Convention.\n\nNever mind there were THREE TREATIES already governing how other humans were treated in war. The current Geneva Convention Treaty hadn't been created yet so all the previous ones clearly didn't matter before that one was signed.\n\nSource: [Wikipedia Geneva Conventions article.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Conventions)",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2mleat/the_imitation_game_or_how_the_breaking_of_the/",
        "text": "For those who haven't seen 'The Imitation Game' and are wondering if they should go to find out more about Alan Turing and his role during the second world war then don't. If you want to see a semi-romantic film about misunderstood genius as Benedict Cumberbatch reprises his role as Sherlock then by all means go for it.\n\nThere is so much utter shit in the move that I cannot possibly go through it all. The first huge blunder is Alan Turing working away separately from everyone else as he builds a Bombe (machine designed to crack enigma). He faces much opposition from people claiming he is wasting his time and the machines could never crack as cipher and the old fashioned methods of 'doing it by hand' (whatever that means) are better. He obtains the resources for this by writing to Winston Churchill without anyone else knowing and getting himself promoted to leader of the team. There are a number of things wrong here:\n\n1. Everyone know machines could crack enigma. The Poles managed it in using machines for the first time in 1938 (they had previously used more laborious methods) and had shared this intelligence with the British.\n1. Alan Turing did not build the Bombe. The mechanical work was done by Gordon Welchman (who doesn't even appear in the film). Turing only designed it playing almost no part in it's actual construction.\n1. The letter that gets sent to Churchill is probably referencing an actual letter sent by four of Bletchely's members in which they asked Churchill for more materials and were granted them. It was not done behind the back of the other members of the team although they did not have the permission of the commander of Bletchely.\n\nAfter much guff about how the machine isn't working Turing finally has a breakthrough in a pub about how to break into the enigma machines. He 'suddenly realises' that he can use the fact that they know what some of the parts of the messages are going to be to work backwards and discover the settings for the machine. This is done because one of the women who works at the intercept station mentions that she knows the German who she listens in to the communications of has a girlfriend because he always starts his messages with the same five letters CILLY. This is patently absurd, again for multiple reasons:\n\n1. How in the world does the interceptor know that every message begins in the same way. They are encrypted that is the whole fucking point of the whole fucking film. Unless this German is so intent on paying homage to his girlfriend that he chose the message key each time specifically so that this would happen in the cipher text then there is no possible way that she could know.\n3. It wouldn't even be possible for a German to ensure that the plaintext to be CILLY as at that point in the war each message began with the same three letters repeated twice so it would have to have been CILCIL as this is how the message key was encrypted. This repetition was used to break enigma and CIL was a repeatedly used as a message key by one German radio operator.\n2. The idea that they would only just have discovered the idea of a crib (part of a message that you know the plaintext for) in 1941 is just completely ridiculous. it would have been impossible to even start constructing a bombe without this idea as it is fundamental to the working of the who fucking machine.\n\nFinally, and really the thing which turns the movie from borderline OK into codswallop of the highest order is this: Using the key idea of using cribs that Turing miraculously thought of just 2000+ years after it was first used they break enigma and discover the location of a collection of U-Boats. So what do they do? Inform their superiors of their great success? No. They keep it a secret because apparently if they tell the admiralty about the fact they have broken enigma then they will use all the intelligence gained willy-nilly and make it obvious to the Germans that enigma has been broken. They instead take it upon themselves to decide which information to release using 'statistics' so that the secret can be kept. The call this source of intelligence ultra and persuade the head of MI6 to smuggle it into war rooms and hope that nobody questions where it is coming from. The interesting part of the film closes with British victory over the Germans apparently with Churchill and other members of the high command still oblivious the enigma had been broken.\n\nThere are of course other minor things and I have compiled a list of them if anyone is interested.\n\n1. The fact that the British have a copy of an enigma machine is something that we can thank Polish intelligence from despite it initially being a French loyal German double agent who captured a machine.\n2. The aforementioned Gordon Welchman does not appear at all in the film and his contributions are either performed by Turing or other member of the team. This is a poor analogy (I hope someone can come up with a better one) but it is like making a film about Nazi military strategy without mentioning someone like Goring or Rommel.\n3. There is never any mention of Colossus (the world's first semi-programmable computer) and it's use in breaking the Lorenz cipher and thus Tommy Flower's contribution is ignored. This is particularly annoying because the closing credits claim that Turing's work shortened the war by at least two years completely ignoring the role that other codes played.\n4. A really basic blunder is made in the closing credits where it is claimed that this information was kept secret for 50 years despite it being declassified in the mid '70s about 30 years after the end of the war.\n\nIn conclusion if you want to see a film about codebreaking during the second world war then this is not your film. Read Simon Singh's The Code Book which is the source for most of this and, if you are in the UK go to Bletchley party I can promise you that you won't regret it. (The national museum of computing is also there). Although if you of go then for heaven's sake get a guided tour. If you want a slighlty shitty Baseballmitt Cuttlefish romance film though then this is for you.",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2mk34d/in_which_ice_cream_is_thoroughly_misrepresented/",
        "text": "I came across [this](http://i.imgur.com/SoLt322.jpg) lovely passage in one of my textbooks. It purports to be historically accurate about the history of ice cream in America, but in actuality, it's deeply flawed. It should be ashamed of itself, misleading poor innocent children about the history of ice cream in America. This is important information, and it's blatantly lying to them!\n\nWhile the passage doesn't claim that the history of ice cream starts in 1843, it also doesn't mention ice cream before then. I'm happy to fill in the missing information. Ice cream as a dish has a long and illustrious history, though when it officially becomes ice cream is a matter of some debate. [This website](http://www.idfa.org/news-views/media-kits/ice-cream/the-history-of-ice-cream) is one of several that claims that ice cream of some sort dates back to the 2nd century BCE, though what it's referring to there is something we'd know as snow cream rather than ice cream. The 2nd century form of ice cream was essentially snow flavoured with honey, fruit, or juice. As I said, snow cream or a snow cone rather than what we'd see as ice cream.\n\nSomething more recognisably ice cream was brought back from China, ostensibly by Marco Polo. This form of ice cream was milk - goat's or cow's, typically - mixed with ice and fruit juice. Consistency-wise, it's much more comparable to gelato or sorbet than ice cream, but it was once again an advance in ice cream-making technique as it added milk to the snow and flavouring combination. By the 1500s, nobles were using it as a palate-cleanser between courses, and by the 1600s, it was being sold in public squares as a dessert. From there, it spread along trade routes and with immigration to the New World.\n\nRecipes for ice cream and ice cream desserts first appeared in England in the early 18th century, but the first record of ice cream in America comes from a letter written in 1744 about a dinner party held by the then governor of Maryland, Thomas Bladen. The strawberry ice cream was apparently enough of a novelty to merit writing about, but also not wildly unaffordable. In 1777, ice cream was being advertised in the *New York Gazette* as being a dessert that everyone could enjoy, implying that it had ceased to be a dinner party novelty, and was instead gaining wider traction as a dessert food for the masses. That said, it did remain fairly expensive until the invention of insulated ice houses in 1800. With this invention, ice cream could be stored more easily, making it a far more marketable commodity. As an example of just how marketable it could be, in 1790, George Washington spent $200 on a summer's worth of ice cream, and [this](http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/treasures/images/uc004810.jpg) is a copy of Thomas Jefferson's recipe for vanilla ice cream. Suffice to say, once the means were available, it could easily become extremely popular.\n\nMaking ice cream, though, remained a limiting factor, as ice cream making processes were slow and tedious. While Nancy Johnson did patent the first ice cream churn in 1843, seven years earlier, a man named Augustus Jackson had developed ice cream-making techniques that were far more efficient than ever and popularised the dessert even more. However, Johnson's invention made ice cream manufacturing into an industry. As the passage says, the first ice cream factory was opened in Baltimore in 1851 by Jacob Fussell. \n\nWhat it gets very wrong, though, are the dates both for the invention of the ice cream cone and for the opening of the first ice cream parlour in the United States. The first ice cream parlour in the US opened in New York City in 1776. It's this shop - owned by Phillip Lenzi - that advertised in the *New York Gazette* that it served ice cream almost every day. By 1876, ice cream had gone well past the ice cream parlour point, with the first soda fountains having come into being in 1874. With them came the ice cream float, with ice cream coupled with soda in glorious, sugary harmony.\n\nBut this brings me to one of the more difficult aspects of this history. Certainly it's a contentious one. The passage claims that the first ice cream cone was invented in St. Louis in 1896, but there's no way this is right. Depending on the definition one uses for \"ice cream cone,\" there's any number of dates and places that could be the first ice cream cone. Throughout the 1700s, for instance, ice cream would often be served with a little wafer as a stomach settler. Occasionally, these were rolled into cone shapes and filled with fruit and ice cream, a clear ancestor to the modern ice cream cone. This use of them is first mentioned in 1769 in a British cookbook. A cookbook called [\"The Italian Confectioner\"](https://archive.org/details/italianconfecti00jarrgoog) published in 1827 includes a recipe for an almond wafer that should be rolled into \"little horns\" and included with ice cream. \"Mrs A. B. Marshall’s Cookery Book\" published in 1888 included a recipe for a \"Cornet with Cream\" which specified that the cornets could \"be filled with any cream or water ice or set custard or fruits, and served for a dinner, luncheon, or supper dish.\" It sounds a bit like an ice cream cone to me. The earliest known patent for an ice cream cone maker, though, comes from Manchester, and was invented by a man named Antonio Valvona in 1902. He describes his invention as:\n\n&gt; By the use of the apparatus of this invention I make cups or dishes of any preferred design from dough or paste in a fluid state this is preferably composed of the same materials as are employed in the manufacture of biscuits, and when baked the said cups or dishes may be filled with ice-cream, which can then be sold by the venders of ice-cream in public thoroughfares or other places.\n\nIt's pretty clearly an ice cream cone.\n\nWhenever it was that the ice cream was invented, it was certainly popularised at the St. Louis World's Fair, though this was in 1904, not 1896. It's been estimated that there were fifty different ice cream vendors at the World's Fair, and that more than a few of them had some variation on an ice cream cone. Charles Menches is largely credited with being the major populariser of ice cream cones at the World's Fair, but [the International Association of Ice Cream Manufacturers claims that Ernest Hamwi was the true inventor](http://drinc.ucdavis.edu/dfoods12_new.htm), and the Smithsonian has what it says is a very old - possibly the oldest - example of ice cream manufacturing tools, provided to them by Albert Doumar on behalf of his relative, Abe Doumare, who he claims is the true inventor of the ice cream cone. David Avayou and Nick Kabbaz have also been floated - or made the claim - as the true inventors of the ice cream cone. Needless to say, it's a contentious issue. However, what is known is that the ice cream cone existed before the 1904 World's Fair, but was thoroughly popularised there. \n\nBeyond that, ice cream became an indelible part of American culture. There were floating ice cream parlours accompanying troops in WWII, and when dairy rations were lifted after the war, Americans consumed over twenty quarts of ice cream per person annually. The availability of ice cream skyrocketed, and it became part of America.\n\nBut let's not forget the history, folks. Never forget.",

Virginia, Tennesee, North Carolina and Arkansas did not join the Confedeacy until AFTER, Lincoln's call to raise troops. So if the South was fighting for Slavery what was the North fighting for? Why the intial invasion of the South by the North? The Confederate Constitution stopped the importation of slaves, 22 Feb 1862.\n\nThat the Upper South seceded in response to Lincoln's reaction to Ft. Sumter does not in any way indicate that slavery wasn't the cause of disunion, and thus the war. It's true that the narrative often leaves out the distinction in the causes of secession between the Secession Winter and the secession of the Upper South. The latter viewed Lincoln's response as a threat to the perceived sovereignty of the Deep South, and by extension their own sovereignty. It was essentially a forced exercise of a perceived natural right in the interests of preserving that right...or permanently forgoing it. So in that sense, concern for states' rights was a motivator for secession. That doesn't mean that tensions over slavery were absolutely necessary for making secession a viable remedy in the first place.\n\nAnd the U.S. outlawed the importation of slaves in 1807, going into enforcement 1808. South Carolina actually did try to reintroduce the slave trade in the 1850s, and there was a black market for importation of slaves throughout the antebellum period into the early years of the Confederacy. But overall the concern was that influx of slaves would cause depreciation of Southerners' existing 'property' held in slavery. So that wasn't really a benevolent policy.\n\nAnd Robert M Shivers has this to say:\n\n&gt;\"If the Declaration of Independence justified the secession of 3,000,000 colonists in 1776, why did it not justify the secession of 5,000,000 Southerns from the Union in 1861?\"- Horace Greeley, NY Tribune\n\n&gt;\"if the Cotton States shall become satisfied that they can do better out of the Union than in it, we insist on letting them go in peace....And whenever a considerable section of our Union shall deliberately resolve to go out, we shall resist all coercive measures designed to keep it in. We hope never to live in a republic where of one section is pinned to the residue by bayonets.\" Horace Greeley, NY Tribune\n\nCiting Horace Greeley as a proponent of secession is nonsense, as Greeley was an abolitionist and liberal Republican. He did voice support for peaceful secession as a concept, but not unilateral secession as advocated by Southerners (and which they later backed with violence). He felt it justified if done by appeal to the nation as a whole, democratically. Not by simple, undemocratic repudiation of law and an election in which all sections were duly represented. (Let's keep in mind that the South were actually overrepresented, and still lost.) Greeley firmly supported the war effort, and actively petitioned Lincoln for more radical anti-slavery policies throughout the war (via actual, open, and stricter enforcement of the Confiscation Acts), such as he writes in his [\"The Prayer of Twenty Millions.\"](http://history.jburroughs.org/cfront/us11/readings_us11/LincolnGreeley.pdf)\n\n&gt;Actually, although I have a copy of the book you mention and know its author, my views are formed from a much wider selection of reading material, including The Real Lincoln, Lincoln Unmasked, Time on the Cross, Defending Dixie, Emancipating Slaves/Enslaving Free Men, Disease of the Public Mind, several biographies of Jefferson Davis and Robt E Lee, When in the Course of Human Event, and many others that don't just regurgitate the self-serving swill that you apparently absorbed without question in govt schools. \n\nLiterally none of those works is respected by any legitimate historian. Two of them are by [Thomas DiLorenzo,](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2h3g9x/in_a_thread_about_how_fdr_was_literally_hitler/ckp6mb1) who's so lacking in integrity that he has no problem utterly fabricating details, as he does in an article that I reviewed [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2i2csy/welcome_to_oh_no_not_another_civil_war_post_i_got/) (which also touches on another of the listed works) by claiming that John Brown was a self-declared communist. He also thinks that abolitionists were morally egregious in their cause and actions, while tirelessly defending fucking slaveowners. If you ever want give the impression that your argument on American history isn't respectable, the most efficient way to do that is probably to cite one of Thomas DiLorenzo's works.\n\n&gt;So let me get this straight, He quoted the VICE president of the CSA at some stupid speech that he made and because of that one speech EVERYONE in the CSA is held to his words. It makes me wonder, did Carey agree with EVERY speech GW Bush or Obama said?\n\nThat's a fair enough point, but the argument following it going on to then declare that Stephens' earlier opposition to secession somehow indicates that slavery wasn't the foundational cause for secession makes no sense. Lee and Davis stated opposition to secession, but also then went on to defend it while contributing to mass casualties. What isn't arguable is that all three of these had an interest in the preservation of slavery. Not supporting secession in 1860 was the majority position by far. Even South Carolina rejected it after Lincoln's election, but then went on to catalyze the secession winter shortly thereafter once it became clearer that there was support for it outside of the state. Such support had been voiced by Georgia politicians following the completion of the Savannah-Charleston railway, although it still took Buchanan's decision to hold certain federal properties in S. Carolina (and misinterpretation of his intentions) to force the rest of the Deep South's secession. The fact that changing circumstances made secession feasible and more pressing an issue doesn't mean that slavery wasn't the reason anyone was interested in seceding in the first place. Even if we go back to the Nullification Crisis, Calhoun notes that forcing a crisis over a tariff was a mere pretext for a growing set of tensions based on sectional differences reducible to slavery.\n\nOf course, why Stephens' speech is selected is due to its salience. It takes a greater set of truths about the motivations of the secessionists and reduces them to a simple speech that's easy to remember and drag out in an argument. Nobody uses it as the sole, official declaration of the cause of all those that fought for and sympathized with the confederacy. Of course, neo-Confederates will do just the same thing with Lincoln's response to Greeley's letter, in which Lincoln states that he prioritizes preserving the Union above anything else—as if Lincoln is somehow the sole arbiter of what Unionist motivations looked like.\n\n&gt;Some people take great joy in hating the South. Slavery would have ended in the South no matter the outcome of the war. Only a fool would think otherwise. It was obvious that immediate emancipation was the worst possible option for the slave. This was proven true by the fact the slave was ill-prepared for the responsibility of freedom. His situation did not improve after the war. For many it only got worse.\n\nThis is just so disgusting that it doesn't really warrant a full rebuttal. I'll just note that slavery was growing, especially in the Deep South. That Southerners were determined to see it *expand*, not just preserved. And that lack of tangible improvement of the quality of life for many freed slaves was not the result of how they were emancipated, but how horribly Reconstruction went largely due to the resistance of white Southerners. But even so, if this were the case, we have to account for why so many freed blacks were fighting for the Union...if they didn't feel they or others could handle freedom, or that swift abolition was a necessary first step in gradual improvement. This Dunning-style comment should rightfully sit at the apex of Mt. Moronia. That anyone believes this or that anyone else takes it seriously is truly alarming.",

        "text": "The lowest of efforts.\n\nRather than going through the entire thread which just sounds like work, I will instead focus on [one particular comment](http://np.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2l9yak/i_am_kevin_burns_executive_producer_of_the_curse/clstlr0?context=1000). His confusion over scientific theory vs scientific fact has already been picked apart, so for that all I can say is that while it is true that there is a degree of speculation always involved, not all speculation is created equally. But there are a few amusing baldface lies I wanted to point out:\n\n&gt;When I was a kid, growing up, the notion that Leif Erickson and the Vikings came to North America was considered an outrageous theory, which was later proven to be true. \n\nThis part I actually find pretty amusing. Kevin Burns, according to his Wiki bio, was born in 1955. L'Anse aux Meadows, the Norse settlement in Newfoundland that confirmed their presence, was first archaeologically explored in 1960. Looking through [this](http://shigitatsu.com/GEOGRAPHIC/1960s.htm) there were numerous articles on the topic in the 1964 National Geographic magazines. [This is](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D03E7D6133CE63ABC4F51DFB6678389679EDE) a New York Times article on the topic from 1962. So no, Mr. Burns, you did not hear that it was an outrageous theory while you were growing up.\n\nLooking beyond that, historians did not consider Vikings in North America an outrageous theory, merely one that wasn't confirmed. But I have seen it entertained in many pre-1960s translations of sagas.\n\n&gt;We - meaning the show, or the ancient astronaut theorists - don't say that aliens built the pyramids, or had that technology. It's the people who built the pyramids who say that. Because it's on the tombs and temples, written on the walls, from these same people whom everyone believes are the native people, they claim their technology and culture comes from beings who came from the stars. In other words, all we do on the show say is \"What if it were true? What if the people who built the pyramids - who did murals devoted to Isis and Osiris and these ancient Egyptian deities, who were all supposedly coming from the sky - what if they were right?...\"\n\nNo they didn't. The Egyptian gods were not said to come from the stars. They were born from Nun, the world originating ocean.\n\n&gt;...What if Moses is history? What if Jesus is history? What if Buddhism and Islam are history? What if all of these ancient cultures - Native American, hindu, you name it - they are right, and we are wrong, with our Western Science?\"\n\nI don't think there is a single person does not think Islam is history. I mean, questioning claims made in the Koran, sure, but saying Islam as a whole is not historical is going a step too far.\n\n&gt;A friend I went to film school with, in Boston, is from India, and he and his crew often help us when we do a shoot in India. And when I first called him, he said \"you're finally coming around.\" I said \"What do you mean\" and he said \"Well, for you, this is theory. For us, in India, this is all history.\" Because in India, they don't consider this pseudo-history. In India, they consider Ancient Aliens history.\n\nBut it's cool, he totally knew this one Indian guy once who told him that this is what people in India believe.",

I suspect some people bring it up because they're Lost Causers, some because of racism, and some just do it because of second-option bias. However there's not a single element of truth to the statement that the first slave owner in the US was a black man.\n\nThe man being referred to is Anthony Johnson, who was an indentured servant who earned his freedom. He purchased a couple of indentured servants of his own, and in 1653, those servants either ran away or were let go. In 1655 Johnson won a court case against one of those servants who was ordered back into service with Johnson as a \"servant for life\". This is the basis for the claim that Anthony Johnson was the first slave owner in America. Several problems with this.\n\n1.) The first non-natively owned slaves in the Americas were native peoples in South America\n\n2.) The first slaves in North America were also native peoples enslaved by Europeans.\n\n3.) The first African slaves in the Americas were enslaved by the Spanish in Portuguese in South America.\n\n4.) The first African slaves in North America were Spanish slaves as part of the San Miguel de Gualdape which was established in 1526. Other Spanish sites in North America had African slaves long before Anthony Johnson came along.\n\n5.) The first indentured servants arrived in America within the first decade after the settlement at Jamestown. \n\n6.) The first black people in English colonies in Jamestown arrived in 1619 as indentured servants.\n\n5.) John Winthrop of Massachusetts and Samuel Maverick of Massachusetts both owned slaves before 1630. Winthrop arrived by 1630, Maverick was in Massachusetts by 1625.\n\n6.) In 1638 some Pequot Indians taken in raids were exchanged for African slaves/servants in the West Indies. This would not be the last time this would happen.\n\n7.) In 1641 Massachusetts would pass it's first slave law.\n\n8.) In 1640 John Punch was sentenced to indentured servitude for life by a Virginia court for attempting to run away to Maryland. \n\n9.) Anthony Johnson would not win his case against Castor until 1655, at *least* 15 years after the first confirmed court case of indentured servitude for life. \n\n10.) The United States didn't exist in 1655. \n\nSo, no matter what way we look at it, there's absolutely no way in which Anthony Johnson can be considered the first slave owner in the United States.",

        "text": "The Catholic Church is a difficult institution to talk about, since for much of its history, it’s been in the sweet spot of the God/Money/Politics [Venn diagram](http://i.imgur.com/GmxpPYI.png). But like the conversational kaiju that we are, social graces mean little to us. But unlike the ideological jaegers we encounter, we have a better grasp of history. \n\nMy focus today will be on a piece of Catholic Social Teaching from the Pontifical Commission on Justice and Peace published [*The Church and Racism: Toward a More Fraternal Society*](http://www.ewtn.com/library/curia/pcjpraci.htm). The document is your run-of-the-mill “Don’t be racist. Ok, kids?” deal. Their message is not particularly nuanced, but it is timeless. Their history is not particularly nuanced either, hence this post. \n\nIn the beginning, the authors start with the proper air of humility of anyone who is attempting to examine the history of an organization they are intimately tied to:\n\n&gt;NOTE: No attempt is made here to trace a complete history of racism, nor of the attitude of the Church in this regard. . . .This by no means implies an effort to gloss over the weakness and even, at times, the complicity of certain Church leaders, as well as of other members of the Church, in this phenomenon.\n\nI believe them when they say that they made no effort to gloss over the darker side of church history. Upon reading the document, we find, unfortunately, that the authors effortlessly gloss over the weakness and complicity of church leaders in the phenomenon of racism and specifically slavery. This is where the bad history lies. I’ll focus on the two worstquotes:\n\n&gt;With the discovery of the New World, attitudes changed. . . . they [colonizers] killed in order to take possession of the land, and reduced first the \"Indians\" and then the blacks to slavery in order to exploit their work. They began to develop a racist theory in order to justify their actions. The popes did not delay in reacting. On June 2, 1537, the bull Sublimis Deus of Paul III denounced those who held that \"the inhabitants of the West Indies and the southern continents...should be treated like irrational animals and used exclusively for our profit and our service\" \n.\n&gt; This trade began in 1562 and the slavery that resulted was to last nearly three centuries. Here once again, the popes and theologians, at the same time as numerous humanists, rose up against this practice. Leo XIII vigorously denounced it in his encyclical In plurimis of May 5, 1888, in which he congratulated Brazil for having abolished slavery. \n\n\nHistory is more than just a list of facts. It's possible to have all correct facts and still do terrible history. This phenomenon is known to professional historians as \"red pilling\". (Just kidding, red pillers barely ever get their facts straight). In this case, the facts are Sublimis Deus does exist and it does denounce the mistreatment of natives. The problem arise from “did not delay”, since Europeans were already two generations into mucking around the Americas and it had been almost 20 years since Cortez cortezed the Aztecs. \n\nThis fails on a second account, since their phrasing obscures the fact that while the Church hierarchy did relatively well in denouncing the terrible treatment and beliefs regarding the Indians, they did a much poorer job in combating the racist theory that underlay the transatlantic slave trade and black slavery. More on that in a bit. \n\nIn the second quote, the bad history here revolves around our definition of \"rose up\". Again, Leo XIII did in fact denounce the slave trade in In Plurimis - *The Supreme Author of all things so decreed that man should exercise a sort of royal dominion over beasts and cattle and fish and fowl, but never that men should exercise a like dominion over their fellow men.* . Using one letter, 300 years after the start of an evil to claim that an organization \"rose up\" is bad historying, at the least. It should be red flag if the most relevant evidence you can find is 10 generations late (*The Birmingham city government has a long history of supporting civil rights. In 2263, Mayor 10010011001 wrote a letter to the human community to congratulate them on the death of the last racist grandpa.*)\n\nBefore I get into the history of the church on these subjects, I’d like to make a note that Church is a century- and continent-spanning organization with millions of members, so when describing the Church’s reaction to something, one data point is not convincing – “I guess [fact about catholics and slaves] don’t real” or vice versa “I guess Las Casas don’t real” jokes won’t make the good history cut any more than “here’s something the pope said in 1888.” Furthermore, what is the Church? The popes? The hierarchy? The laity? For this, I’ll follow the authors’ lead and consider the writings of popes and hierarchy as evidence of the Church’s reaction to racism in slavery. \n\nOk, so the rest of the *The Church and Racism* is a nicely curated list of pleasant things that the Church actually did. Combined with phrases like “rose up”, it would be reasonable if a casual reader came away with the impression that the Catholic Church at most times and most places had been against racism and slavery. \n\nBut when we look at the broader Church’s reaction to racism and slavery, we discover a very mixed history. There is the aforementioned Bartolemeo de Las Casas, a genuine defender a human dignity. However, even Las Casas’s life showed the murky reaction of the Church, since at one point in his life he owned black slaves and proposed African slavery as a desirable alternative to Indian slavery. This viewpoint, that black slavery was workable alternative, was not exactly uncommon. In the 1600s French Caribbean, we see Jesuits, Dominicans and Capuchins sometimes writing letters suggesting that Africans were somehow marked for slavery or that the institution of African slavery divinely sanctioned, if not ordered. These same men often pressed back against Indian slavery. Complicating things, there exist writings, often from the same priests later on, doubting the legitimacy of enslaving Christians and discovering good qualities in the African slaves.^1 In antebellum US, the “most striking aspect of the response of John Hughes [archbishop of New York] to the institution of slavery was his ambivalence\" and “When members of the hierarchy of the Catholic Church in America in the 19th century looked at Catholic involvement in slavery and determined that slavery must be handled politically, and not morally, they assumed that slavery was not necessarily immoral.”^2 The bishop of Louisiana in 1861 was less ambivalent. I’ll give you one guess on his thoughts. You are correct. I’m already 1200 words in so I’ll leave it at that, though there is plenty more evidence that shows the reaction of the Church to racism and black slavery often terrible. So no, the Church did not rise up without delay in renouncing slavery or the slave trade. Nor were they on the front lines of combating slavery. Except in the many times and places where they were. If you had to boil down the history of Catholic Church on slavery and racism (which I recommend against since the reaction was anything but catholic), it would be something good, something bad, a bit of both. \n-\n1.

In other words, today's Democratic party is still basically the one that championed slavery in the 1800's and segregation in the 1900's while the poor Republicans have been champions of civil rights throughout, and to suggest the contrary is just baseless slander.\n\nNaturally, he was presented with several links that disputed his claim, but all those were nonsense because of course they were. Problem is, he never presented any facts to back up his argument. In lieu of facts he engaged in an oddly histrionic analysis of the situation (or at least his version of it) and kept going back to a rallying cry of \"provide evidence of a shift in policies\".\n\nNow this is obviously a person who lives on that river in Egypt. And there isn't anything short of a fucking phone booth time machine full of American political figures and historians that will convince him that he's wrong. But this narrative is indicative of a troubling obstinance in the face of a party's actual history that I've seen before. Why not just debate the fact that Republicans or Conservatives have racist policies *in the present*? Why go out of your way to fight a battle whose outcome has already long since been established in the annals of our collective past?\n\nI have no idea. But I am happy to say that the good people in TIL already posted a bunch of links refuting /u/Stewpid's claims, so I won't have to scour the internet in search of sources (which wouldn't have been all that hard, but I'm lazy, so yeah...)\n\nThe story of one George Wallace, a Segregationist Democrat:\n\n&gt;During his campaign, Wallace had vowed to stand in schoolhouse doorways to personally bar the entrance of black students into white institutions.\n\n&gt;In June 1963, he got his chance. The federal courts had ordered the integration of the University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, and US Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach flew down from Washington, DC, to enforce the order. More than 200 national reporters and all three of the major broadcast networks were on hand for the promised confrontation. From behind a podium, Wallace stood in the June heat and raised his hand to peremptorily bar the approach of Katzenbach. Then he read a seven-minute peroration that avoided the red-meat language of racial supremacy and instead emphasized “the illegal usurpation of power by the Central Government.” In footage carried on all three networks, the nation watched as Wallace hectored Katzenbach, culminating with Wallace declaiming, “I do hereby denounce and forbid this illegal and unwarranted action by the Central Government.”8 It was pure theater, even down to white lines chalked on the ground to show where the respective thespians should stand (Katzenbach approached more closely than expected, but ultimately that only heightened the drama). Wallace knew from the start that he would back down, and after delivering his stem-winder, that is what he did. Within two hours, as expected, the University of Alabama’s first two black students were on campus.\n\n&gt;Over the next week, the nation reacted. More than 100,000 telegrams and letters flooded the office of the Alabama governor. More than half of them were from outside of the South. Did they condemn him? Five out of every 100 did. The other 95 percent praised his brave stand in the schoolhouse doorway.\n\n&gt;The nation’s reaction was an epiphany for Wallace, or perhaps better, three thunderbolts that together convinced Wallace to reinvent himself yet again. First, Wallace realized with a shock that hostility toward blacks was not confined to the South. “He had looked out upon those white Americans north of Alabama and suddenly been awakened by a blinding vision: ‘They all hate black people, all of them. They’re all afraid, all of them. Great god! That’s it! They’re all Southern. The whole United States is Southern.’” Wallace suddenly knew that overtures to racial resentment would resonate across the country.\n\n&gt;His second startling realization was that he, George Wallace, had figured out how to exploit that pervasive animosity. The key lay in seemingly non-racial language. At his inauguration, Wallace had defended segregation and extolled the proud Anglo-Saxon Southland, thereby earning national ridicule as an unrepentant redneck. Six months later, talking not about stopping integration but about states’ rights and arrogant federal authority—and visually aided by footage showing him facing down a powerful Department of Justice official rather than vulnerable black students attired in their Sunday best—Wallace was a countrywide hero. “States’ rights” was a paper-thin abstraction from the days before the Civil War when it had meant the right of Southern states to continue slavery. Then, as a rejoinder to the demand for integration, it meant the right of Southern states to continue laws mandating racial segregation—a system of debasement so thorough that it “extended to churches and schools, to housing and jobs, to eating and drinking … to virtually all forms of public transportation, to sports and recreations, to hospitals, orphanages, prisons, and asylums, and ultimately to funeral homes, morgues, and cemeteries.” That’s what “states’ rights” defended, though in the language of state-federal relations rather than white supremacy. Yet this was enough of a fig leaf to allow persons queasy about black equality to oppose integration without having to admit, to others and perhaps even to themselves, their racial attitudes.\n\n&gt;“Wallace pioneered a kind of soft porn racism in which fear and hate could be mobilized without mentioning race itself except to deny that one is a racist,” a Wallace biographer argues. The notion of “soft porn racism” ties directly to the thesis of “Dog Whistle Politics.” Wallace realized the need to simultaneously move away from supremacist language that was increasingly unacceptable, while articulating a new vocabulary that channeled old, bigoted ideas. He needed a new form of racism that stimulated the intended audience without overtly transgressing prescribed social limits. The congratulatory telegrams from across the nation revealed to Wallace that he had found the magic formula. Hardcore racism showed white supremacy in disquieting detail. In contrast, the new soft porn racism hid any direct references to race, even as it continued to trade on racial stimulation. As a contemporary of Wallace marveled, “he can use all the other issues—law and order, running your own schools, protecting property rights—and never mention race. But people will know he’s telling them ‘a nigger’s trying to get your job, trying to move into your neighborhood.’ What Wallace is doing is talking to them in a kind of shorthand, a kind of code.”\n\n&gt;Finally, a third bolt of lightening struck Wallace: he could be the one! The governor’s mansion in Montgomery need not represent his final destination. He could ride the train of revamped race-baiting all the way to the White House. Wallace ran for president as a third-party candidate in 1964, and then again in 1968, 1972, and 1976. It’s his 1968 campaign that most concerns us, for there Wallace ran against a consummate politician who was quick to appreciate, and adopt, Wallace’s refashioned racial demagoguery: Richard Nixon. We’ll turn to the Wallace-Nixon race soon, but first, another set of weathered bones must be excavated—the remains of Barry Goldwater.\n\nSource: http://www.salon.com/2013/12/22/how_the_gop_became_the_white_mans_party/\n\nThe story continues from there, and cites many more examples, but let's move on to the 1964 Republican Convention:\n\n\n&gt;And what a show the GOP convention was! Conservatives from the West, the South and the Midwest were convinced that the only way moderate \"Wall Street Republicans\" had been able to run away with the presidential nomination every four years was that \"a few secret kingmakers in New York\" conspired to steal it, as Illinois activist Phyllis Schlafly put it in a self-published book, A Choice Not an Echo, several hundred thousand copies of which were distributed in the summer of 1964. (Some convention delegates reported receiving more than 60 copies in the mail.) They weren't going to let it be stolen this time.\n\n&gt; (Barry) Goldwater's finance chairman, Bill Middendorf, warned campaign aide Dean Burch that \"the 1952 tricks will be used again\": planted stories, whispering campaigns, threats, cajolery and the \"shanghaiing and spiriting of delegates and alternates to distant points.\" Goldwater delegates were warned to be on the lookout \"for unexpectedly easy companionship from new-found female friends.\" They were to contact the Goldwater headquarters on the 15th floor of the Mark Hopkins immediately after landing at the airport and to travel around town in pairs along pre-timed routes in radio-equipped cars. They used walkie-talkies only as back-ups, because these could be too easily tapped into—as, indeed, they had tapped into Scranton's.\n\n&gt;Bill Scranton, whose patrician family ran the Pennsylvania coal town that bore his name, seemed to comedian Dick Gregory like \"the guy who runs to John Wayne for help.\" (Goldwater looked like a cowboy.) Scranton had entered the race as a last-minute act of noblesse oblige. \"Today the nation—and indeed the world—waits to see if another proud political banner will falter, grow limp and collapse in the dust,\" he had said as he announced his candidacy just four weeks before the convention. \"Lincoln would cry out in pain if we sold out our principles.\"\n\n&gt;According to a Harris Poll taken late that June, 62 percent of rank and file Republicans preferred Scranton to Goldwater, but the supposed Wall Street kingmakers were in dithering disarray. (\"What in God's name has happened to the Republican Party!\" muttered Henry Cabot Lodge —the party's 1960 vice presidential nominee—as he paged through the delegate list in his hotel room. \"I hardly know any of these people!\") The moderates' strategy was to put the Goldwaterites' perceived extremism on televised display, hoping delegates would flock to Scranton after being flooded by telegrams from outraged voters watching at home.\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/1964-republican-convention-revolution-from-the-right-915921/?no-ist\n\nAgain, read the whole thing, it's jarring.\n\nThe central shift obviously occurred amidst the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960's, with Goldwater, Johnson, and Nixon being major players. This article sums it up tidily:\n\n&gt;You can’t really look at the history of American politics through the lens of the Republican Party meaning one immutable thing and the Democratic Party meaning another. Because also, like, 100 years ago, both parties had conservative and progressive wings, which is no longer the case. It would also be difficult to place most people from 100 years ago into either of today’s parties. It makes more sense to look at it through the lens of North and South, conservative and progressive.\n\nSource: http://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/197976/explainer-how-democrats-and-republicans-switched-sides-on-civil-rights/\n\nI'll leave it at that, and I urge you guys (if you have the time) to read *all* of the sources provided in the above TIL thread. Again, while this doesn't prove that *today's* Republican Party is racist in any way, it does shed a tremendous amount of light on its past and effectively shoots down many of the (at times purposeful) misconceptions people may have about it. When it comes to these types of issues, few things are black and white (horrible pun, I apologize). There is always going to be a long and complex story that needs to be told, and must never be forgotten...\n",

Hopefully someone more knowledgeable will fill in the gaps if any, but I feel like the bad history is glaring enough that I can do this about right.\n\n[Here](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30067490) is the offending article.\n\n&gt; Muslims discovered the Americas more than three centuries before Christopher Columbus, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said.\n\n&gt;He made the claim during a conference of Latin American Muslim leaders in Istanbul, pointing to a diary entry in which Columbus mentioned a mosque on a hill in Cuba.\n\nYou'd think if there had been a mosque in Cuba in the 1490s more people would know. This claim can apparently traced back to a 1996 publication by a Dr. Youssef Mroueh. You can read his thoughts in the original text [here](http://www.sunnah.org/history/precolmb.htm). A large part of his claims seem to be based on fanciful etymology, like for instance :\n\n&gt; On October 12, 1492 CE, Columbus landed on a little island in the Bahamas that was called GUANAHANI by the natives. Renamed SAN SALVADOR by Columbus. GUANAHANI is derived from Mandinka and modified Arabic words. GUANA (IKHWANA) means 'brothers' and HANI is an Arabic name. Therefore the original name of the island was 'HANI BROTHERS'.\n\nYou could probably do this with any language. Case in point : \"Annie\" is a French name.  \"Kana\" means \"song\" in Breton. Therefore this place was inhabited by Breton settlers and named \"Annie's song\". This is probably more plausible that the original claim.\n\nAnyway, let's get back to that diary entry. [What it actually says](http://mith.umd.edu/eada/html/display.php?docs=columbus_journal.xml), at the date of Monday, the 29th of October, is *(emphasis added)* :\n\n&gt; Remarking on the position of the river and port, to which he [the diary, or at least the version we got, is in the third person] gave the name of San Salvador, he describes its mountains as lofty and beautiful, like the Pena de las Enamoradas, and one of them has another little hill on its summit, **like a graceful mosque**. The other river and port, in which he now was, has two round mountains to the S.W., and a fine low cape running out to the W.S.W.\n\nThere. It's a comparison. Mosques are a common element of the landscape in Southern Spain, where Columbus sailed from and recruited most of his crewmembers.  Case closed.\n\nIn their desperate efforts to be uncontroversial, the BBC has put it like this :\n\n&gt; However many scholars believe the reference is metaphorical, describing an aspect of the mountain that resembled part of a mosque.\n\n\"Many scholars\" probably means \"everyone who can read\".\n\nBack to Erdogan :\n\n&gt; Mr Erdogan also said \"Muslim sailors arrived in America in 1178\".\n\nI'm not sure where he picked up that date. The [Sung document](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Columbian_trans-oceanic_contact#Arabic) is from 1178 ; it's a Chinese text mentioning the travels of Arabs to a land called \"Mulan-Pi\", which I'm told means \"magnolia skin\", \"magnolia\" being some sort of pinkish shade. If the news of a transatlantic journey reached China in 1178, there's good reason to think that the actual trip had taken place decades beforehand.\n\nRegardless of the date, there is no archeological evidence for this journey that I know of on either side of the Atlantic. An obvious objection to this rebuttal is that there was no archeological evidence for the discovery of the Americas by Norse sailors before we found some, but we did have accounts of the discovery (in the form of sagas), which seems to be lacking here. This is all the more surprising that medieval Arabs have left us much more literature than their Norse contemporaries, and were in constant contact with all major civilisations. At last, it does seem to me that Europeans have more of a \"magnolia\" skin, and it makes much more sense both because of this and from an historical perspective that \"Mulan-pi\" should refer to Spain.\n\nWikipedia also hints that the sailing technology would be inadequate, but I don't feel qualified to comment.\n\nFinally, we do have plenty of written accounts of the Americas, at least the coastal parts, after 1492, and none of them mention any Muslims. Maybe they all died of smallpox between 1492 and 1493 ? Who knows ?",

        "text": "I'm surprised nobody has tackled *The DaVinci Code* yet. Fair warning, I actually really like this movie despite all it's silliness (or maybe because of it). I'm a big fan of stories which are about revealing the \"secret history\" of things. Combine that element with a movie about solving puzzles and you've got something which I have a fun time watching.\n\nAs a side note--I will not be talking here about any of the bad history regarding the \"secret history\" of the Catholic church. My focus will be on all the *other* history, and there's plenty of badhistory to go around. The entire movie is fodder for /r/badreligion, especially when it starts talking about the meaning of various symbols, but I'm going to try to avoid most of that discussion since this post would end up being mostly bad religion, rather than bad history. \n\nAlso as I watched this, I just realized that the albino monk is supposed to be speaking English with an Italian accent. Oops. Guess I'm not the most observant of viewers, because I've seen this movie probably a half dozen times over the years and never picked up on that until now. \n\nOh, and this is a rare case where I think the movie is actually better than the book it's based on, which is a rare thing. \n\n\n**3:43** \"Symbols are a language\" says Langdon. Some /r/badlinguistics here. Symbols are at *best* orthography (i.e. a writing system), which is separate from language. \n\n**4:15** \"They would disagree with you in Spain. There they are robes worn by monks.\" Nope. Actually [these robes](http://i.imgur.com/ymfP4dJ.jpg) are worn during the festival of [Semanta Santa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Week_in_Seville). The robes are won by members of some Catholic orders who are doing penance for sins committed during the previous year. In other words, not worn by monks, but by lay people. \n\n**4:22** \"Poor, poor Poseidon. That is his trident, and a symbol of power to millions of the ancients.\" The trident is only **one** of Poseidon's symbols. The bull was a really popular symbol for him, as were fish, dolphins, and even horses. Also, does anybody know the name of [this painting](http://i.imgur.com/YHTwjF6.jpg)? It looks sort of Renaissancy, or at least inspired by the Renaissance.\n\n**4:45** Langdon calls Horus a pagan god, here equating pagan with non-Christian. Generally speaking, paganism is more specific than that, as it refers to religions without written creeds, or without established, orthodox (for their religion), practices. Egyptian religions, by that definition, are not pagan. \n\n**4:48** \"Understanding our past determines actively our ability to understand the present\", as it's just a rewording of the idea that history is cyclical and that we can predict what's going to happen by knowing what *did* happen. Because my understanding of the American Revolution is *so* useful in helping me to understand the Syrian Civil War, right?\n\n**5:08** \"How do we write our own histories and thus define ourselves?\" The idea that defining ourselves requires a written history is a troublesome one to me, not least because of the reverence paid by so many in the modern world to what's written down. \n\n**5:15** \"How do we find original truth?\" Another troubling idea is that there's a single truth in history. This leads people down the road of second-option bias, but it also prevents people from understanding that two stories can tell the same event but be completely different things, depending on the perspective of audience, storyteller, time, and a whole host of other factors. I like to point to the films *The Wind That Shakes the Barley* and *Michael Collins* for an easy to understand look at this. Both films tell the story of the Irish struggle for independence in the early 20th century and the subsequent Irish Civil War. Both tell it from a pro-Irish independence viewpoint. Both films tell a *dramatically* different story. \n\n[FWIW, I actually really liked this sequence. I think a lecture on religious symbols and their changing meanings could be a fascinating one. ]\n\n**7:45** Here we get to see a gratuitously long scene where Silas practices various aspects of self-mortification. As far as I know (and /u/domini_canes can probably provide more info on this), the Catholic Church does not approve or allow of any rituals which cause physical harm to the individual practicing them. So flagellation (which was practiced in the early days of Christianity, but not much since) is out. So is the metal strap that Silas wears around his leg. A little later on this is referred to as a *cilice*, but traditionally a *cilice* is actually a garment made of hair, not intended to cause harm. \n\n**12:49** /r/bad_religion (really almost all of *The da Vinci Code is /r/bad_religion) The leader of Opus Dei is addressed as Your Eminence. Only in Catholic hierarchy, the title \"Eminence\" is reserved for those who are cardinals or higher. The leader of Opus Dei is a bishop. The organization is unique in that it's a personal prelature--normally bishops are restricted to a geographical area over which they have responsibility. However the leader of Opus Dei has responsibility for all of the members of Opus Dei, no matter where they live. Still a bishop though one with a wider authority. It's been this way since 1982, so well before Dan Brown wrote his book, or before the movie was made. \n\n**14:28** /r/badarthistory. \"The Vitruvian Man. It's one of Leonardo da Vinci's most famous sketches.\" Except what da Vinci sketched *isn't* a Vitruvian man. The Vitruvian man is a concept created in the 1st century B.C. by the Roman Marcus Vitruvius Pollio. The idea of the Vitruvian man holds that if a perfectly proportioned human is placed inside a square, which is then placed inside a circle so that the corners of the square are just touching the arc of the circle, then the precise center of both square and circle will be the navel of the human.\n\nOnly it doesn't work that way unless you distort the shape of the body. Leonardo got it to work by playing with the shapes. His square doesn't sit inside the circle, and the center of the square and circle of his \"Vitruvian\" man is the man's penis, not the navel (Freud would probably have a few things to say about *that*). Interestingly enough, it appears as if da Vinci's model may have [had a hernia](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2014/02/vitruvian_man_s_hernia_leonardo_da_vinci_drawing_shows_flaws_of_human_evolution.html).\n\nSauniere's body was not placed within a square, and thus could not be a Vitruvian man, not even da Vinci's modified version of said Vitruvian man.\n\nAlso it's not a pentacle on Sauniere's chest, as a pentacle is a pentagram within a circle. No circle means no pentacle. \n\n**28:22** \"She [the Mona Lisa] appears larger from the left than on the right. Historically the left was female, the right was male.\"\n\nLots of vagueness here with \"historically\". When? By whom? In what context? The most persistent association of the left with anything is that of the left with the Devil, or with hell, thanks to Christianity and the Bible. There's some persistent medical association with reproduction and left vs right in ancient and medieval texts.^1 For example there's the idea that women had multiple chambers in their womb and that males were conceived in one (the right), and females in another (the left). Hippocrates suggests that a male fetus will incline to the right, a female to the left, and Maimonides suggested that if a male's right testicle is larger than his left, then he'll give birth to males. However all of this is within the context of reproduction--not in general iconography, and this is medieval or ancient thought, not Renaissance thought (which is when the Mona Lisa was painted).\n\n**31:57** The Priory Sion comes up. Robert Langdon: \"The Priory of Sion is a myth\". Correct, it **is** a myth, though by the end of the movie we're supposed to be convinced that it isn't one. The Wikipedia page on [The Priory of Sion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priory_of_Sion) actually does a pretty thorough job of going over all the badhistory about this organization. The TL,DR is that the organization was actually founded in 1956 by a Frenchman named Pierre Plantard. In the 1960s Plantard created a fictional history for his organization for the purpose of his pursuing his own claim of being the [Last Roman Emperor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Roman_Emperor). A book was published in 1982 which sensationalized the group, and Dan Brown used the 1982 book as the basis for *The da Vinci Code*. \n\n**42:31** Here we learn that the First Crusade was orchestrated by the Priory of Sion and their military arm the Knights Templar and led by a French king. This is badhistory even for the fake badhistory of the da Vinci Code, because the Priory of Sion was supposed to have been founded in 1099 in Jerusalem after it's conquest in the First Crusade. Kind of hard to have an organization so powerful it can orchestrate a massive war *before* that organization was even founded. Guess they must have borrowed King Edward's time machine.\n\nAlso the Knights Templar weren't founded until 1120. Kind of hard to have a military wing of a secret order participate in the conquering of a city when that military wing wouldn't exist for another 21 years. \n\nOh, and the idea of there even being a nation of France in 1095 is laughable, much less the idea that the First Crusade was lead by any single man. It was a coalition of forces led by various powerful princes and lords (many of whom were from the area which is now France, but certainly wouldn't have thought of themselves as \"French\").\n\n**43:00** Where we learn that the Templars just \"one day stopped looking\" for their treasure, rushed back to Rome and were given \"limitless power\" by the Pope. According to Langdon both of these were \"facts\". Of course the problem is that the first fact isn't one--the Templar knights weren't \"looking\" for something, and if they were, it sure took an awful long time to find it since they were founded in 1120, and they weren't given their supposed \"limitless power\" until 1139, almost 20 years later.\n\nThe \"limitless power\" that Langdon refers to here is probably the [Omne Datum Optimum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omne_Datum_Optimum) which was a papal bull that officially recognizes the Knights Templar and exempts them from tithes and local taxes, as well as certain other local laws. It also put them under papal protection. In 1144 their authority was extended, allowing them to build their own churches, to bury their dead in their own churches and to collect tithes and taxes on Templar land. Not exactly the condensed timeline suggested at in *The da Vinci Code*.\n\n**43:21** I have no idea what [this](http://i.imgur.com/fcNADDr.jpg) outfit is, but it's certainly *not* 14th century papal garb. I especially don't know what the massive pendant is supposed to be for or the silly looking bee's nest on top. \n\n**43:47** Langdon repeats the Friday the 13th myth, only the chronology is completely wrong. It was actually King Phillip IV, not the Vatican who wanted the Templars arrested. Criminal charges against various Templar knights had been discussed as early as 1305. On October 13, 1307, Phillip IV ordered the arrest of large numbers of the Templars, and tortured confessions out of many of them. It wasn't until *after* the confessions of the Templars that the Pope issued instructions to European monarchs to arrest the Templars. That was on November 22, 1307. It wasn't until 1312 that the Templars were officially disbanded. It was *far* from a \"clockwork plan\" to strip the Templars of power in one fell swoop. Almost all the Templars lived out their days--either as retirees, or absorbed into other orders. \n\nIn fact, the [Chinon Parchment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinon_Parchment), written in 1308 indicates pretty strongly that the destruction of the Templars was not a nefarious plot by the Catholic church to destroy the group. \n\nPinning the \"Friday the 13th\" superstition on the Templars is basically folk etymology, as no evidence exists of any such superstition before the 19th century. If the cause and origins of the myth *were* the arrest and destruction of the Templars, there would be evidence in the written record before the 19th century.\n\n**55:52** \"My God. I don't believe this. A rose. The rose was a symbol for the Holy Grail.\"\n\n/r/badliterarystudies joins the fray! Arthurian legend/myth used to be a passion of mine. Medieval epics still are. I can't recall a *single* instance of the Holy Grail being mentioned in conjunction with a rose, much less the rose being a standard symbol for the Grail. Oh, and it might surprise Langdon to learn that in the earliest Grail accounts, the Grail, while magical, wasn't associated with Christ at all. Chrétien de Troyes, who wrote some of the earliest Arthurian legends, simply called it \"a grail\".\n\n**1:00:26** \"A cryptex. They are used to keep secrets. It's da Vinci's design.\" No it's not. It's a made up word by Dan Brown specifically for his novel. It's a cool word, and it conveys the idea of the thing well, but it's not a real thing at all. Also /r/badscience!, because vinegar is an incredibly weak acid that would take hours to eat away the papyrus. \n\n**1:01:04** \"I've never met a girl who knew that much about a cryptex.\" Are you *flirting* with her Langdon? \n\n**1:01:46** Did I just see her steal [Mr. Miyagi's](http://youtu.be/v4vnJjUimvM?t=1m7s) healing technique?\n\n",

I'm going to ignore his stupid logic about why Hitler has the best fanbase, since none of it actually shows why he has the best fanbase. Apologies in advance if this doesn't meet R5 or is too close to the Moratorium (as this is my first submission, I'm not terribly sure how stringent it is).\n&gt;Hitler. While this will get downvoted to hell:\n\nAs it should\n\n&gt;The people who actually like Hitler:\n\nYou mean besides Nazis?\n\n&gt;whether for the way he built the economy for the German people\n\nHe did not \"build the economy for the German people\" so much as build the economy for the German middle class (who, surprise surprise, formed the bulk of the Nazi party). \n\nThe \"Four Year Plan\" set in place to stimulate agricultural growth actually hindered it. Increased urbanization forced farmhands away from farms, leaving them understaffed and unable to sell. Severe shortages of many different items (most notably several types of fruit, coffee and butter) were commonplace. Many farmers were forced into subsistence farming, producing only enough for themself and stagnating the agricultural sector of the economy.\n\nWhile unemployment went down, a large number of those who became employed were put to use on public works projects. While this, in and of itself, is not a bad thing (for example, look at the many projects done in America during the Depression), the projects were often military in nature and used only to further the Party's goals in Europe. Even with all of this, production levels had yet to reach the pre-WWI levels. [source](http://coffeecuphistory.wordpress.com/2013/05/06/the-myth-of-nazi-efficiency/)\n\nLastly, a large part of the German workforce (close to 20%) was comprised of forced labor taken from conquered areas (generally from Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union). These workers were often literally worked to death, or killed through a deliberate lack of shelter, food and the like. [source](http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005180)\n\nAny building of the economy that derives from slave labor and forces a significant portion of your population to live with only the basic necessities cannot be called successful. \n\n&gt;the fact Hitler was involved with the autoboahn with freeway construction\n\nThe Autobahn was first conceived in the 1920s (which, incidentally, was during the days of the Wiemar Republic, long before Hitler came into power).\n\nActual construction of the Autobahn (the first section of it, anyways) began in 1929, and it opened to the public in 1932 (a year before Hitler came to power).\n\nAfter he came into power, he coopted it for his own use. The majority of German citizens did not own a car at the time, which was a luxury reserved only for the rich elite. As a matter of fact, the Nazi party started a program for the average German citizen to purchase a car through the purchase of stamps, only for the money to be confiscated and the car never delivered [source](http://people.westminstercollege.edu/staff/bknorr/html/history3.htm)\n\nThis meant that the Autobahn didn't have nearly enough cars on it to justify its expense. This relegated it into a gigantic propaganda affair (with the side effect of being very useful militarily), which only came to its full use much later during WWII. [source](http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/reichs.cfm)\n\n&gt;\"The Reich Hunting Law\" that every PETA person should be thankful for\n\nWhile it's true that several environmental laws were passed during the Nazi regime, the motives behind them weren't as pure as one would imagine. \n\nFirstly, with the passing of said law, Jews were forbidden to hold hunting permits (Majer, Deimut. \"Notes to Page 169 - 170.\" \"Non-Germans\" Under the Third Reich, page 680). While this seems rather innocuous, it was yet another way for them to try and turn the Jews into subhumans in the eyes of the German population.\n\nIn the propaganda film \"The Eternal Jew,\" a section showing the kosher ritual of slaughtering sheep and other such animals was shown to highlight how separate the Jews were. This led into a provision of the Reich Hunting Law which forbid mutilation of animal carcasses, thus denying Jews the ability to eat kosher meat.\n\n&gt;the rocket technology that probably helped ensure the front page of Reddit can talk about us landing on a comet\n\nWhile it's true that the Nazi regime made several advances to rocket technology, the majority of their research actually came from the Verein für Raumschiffahrt, an amateur rocket society which was formed in 1927. They began research into rocketry, and eventually sought funding from the German army (in 1930, before Hitler came into power). [source](http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/TRC/Rockets/history_of_rockets.html)\n\nThough the society eventually shut down (mostly over budget concerns, though also over concerns that they were testing too close to Berlin) and the army took over, the latter were not responsible for the majority of the development of the rocket (which was further expanded by the US far beyond what the Nazis had been able to achieve).\n\n&gt;the anti semantics who hated Jews that he killed (because a fan of someone does NOT have to have a good heart, be moral, or anything else... FAN BASE, people that thought this act was great even if you and I think it was horrible)\n\nWhile this part isn't bad history, I figured that I would toss it in here as well.\n\nThis is about the BEST fanbase, and a fanbase that goes around murdering other people on the basis of their race is not the best fanbase. It's not even a good fanbase.",

But it's my first post here, I blame performance anxiety.\n \n \nIn the comments of a thread in /r/TumblrInAction (don't judge me), someone made the claim that \"we [The USA] haven't fought to protect American freedom since 1945\". That's apparently a pretty controversial statement, but [not in the way that I expected](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/2m6hno/male_soldiers_who_die_in_battle_do_so_because/cm1ss4a).\n \n \n&gt; What about 1945 was defending freedom?\n&gt; Pearl habor could have been easily prevented, it was not a surprise attack for Washington they intentionally delayed information to the base and were for several mouths doing \"pop up cruises\" in japans waters with the express purpose of making them attack.\n&gt; WW1 has a story as well and the fact america entered the war is agreed to lead to the raise of Lenin and hilter by most historians\n \n \nI'm not even gonna touch that first part, since it's /r/conspiratard material more than anything else. The WW1 part is the one that irks me.\n \n \n\"Most historians\" apparently agree that the US intervention in western Europe led to the raise of Lenin. The US must apparently have declared war a bit sooner than I remember, since Lenin was a founder of the Bolsheviks in 1902, was involved in the Revolution of 1905, and came back to Russia for some more after the February revolution (In March 1917). The USA declared war on Germany in early April, so unless Lenin was a time traveller, I have a hard time seeing where the direct influence is. If anyone helped to raise Lenin to such heights among the players of WW1, the Germans, who weakened the Tsar's armies then gave Lenin the authorisation he needed to go back to Russia, probably played a slightly more important role than the US of A.\n \n \nThen, there is the claim that the US also created Hitler. As a frenchman, I find it deeply insulting that once again, some random American redditor is trying to steal the accomplishements of my great nation. First you ignore our contribution to your independance, and now you try to take Hitler from us, too? When will you stop?!\n \n \n~~Most of the causes for Hitler's rise to power can indeed be traced back to WW1, and in particular to the Treaty of Versailles, where Germany was carved up, demilitarized, and made to pay reparations of war for the next thirteen generations.~~ Disregard that, it is [bad history™](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2ma03g/us_interventionism_created_communist_russia/cm2k1qk). Maybe our friendly redditor is claiming that the treaty was too lenient, and that that leniency led to WW2 (a feeling that most frenchmen of the time would agree with, including Foch and his \"This is not peace. It is an armistice for 20 years\" comment). Who knows, maybe if Germany had been painted blue, filled with frenchmen, and named \"French Empire 2.0\", WW2 would never had happened. However, I'm not sure that \"most historians\" would agree with that. ~~Usually, Hitler's ascension is linked to the fact that the treaty might have been a teensy-bitsy too harsh on Germany.~~ A view, at the time, mainly shared by the USA and the British (always happy to vex France), who pushed pretty hard to keep the french from going too far with the sanctions.\n \n \nA bit further down in the comments, by the same guy, Churchill caused WW2 by not allying himself with Hitler against the commies, the US and Britain deliberately bombed Germany to hell so that they could be Numbers 1 and 2 economic powers in the world, and another contender chimes in with \"the french are bloodlusted due to the whole shaming of the French-Prussian war of 1871, too\".

        "text": "Recently, Michelle Obama said a thing, which has been paraphrased in [this comment here](http://imgur.com/8hlavHA,fHm3iK9#1). The bit she said was that the Founding Fathers \"became American\" rather than having been \"born American,\" something which is relevant at a naturalisation ceremony. This has, of course, spawned other bad history (including [this](http://imgur.com/8hlavHA,fHm3iK9#0) incredibly low-hanging fruit), but it's the original statement I want to focus on. There's two perspectives on it. Were the American colonists British, and only becoming American after the signing of the Declaration of Independence? Or were they always American, and Michelle Obama is just getting too hung up in legal terminology? \n\nOn a linguistic level, the word \"American\" was most definitely in use by the 18th century, though it wasn't used in its modern sense. Rather, \"American\" was used to refer to Native Americans and to the things on the continent (\"American crops,\" for instance, might have included maize or tobacco). The same is true of later uses, where rather than designating a particular identity or nationality, it would instead incorporate geography. A person born in the colonies might be seen as an \"English-American,\" for instance - English and a subject of the king, but residing in America.\n\nEven by the 1760s and 1770s, there is still linguistic ambiguity about what \"American\" means and whether or not there is an \"American\" identity rather than an identity based around being a British subject living in the Americas. With the Albany Congress in 1754, there was an idea of the colonies at least having the *potential* of being united, though in that case, the Albany Plan proposed by Ben Franklin that would have done so in a more official capacity was rejected. During this time, though, newspapers and writings did refer to the people living more generally in the Colonies as \"Americans,\" though it's once again likely that for many, this was more a geographical term than one of identity. On a strictly geographical level, the first comment I linked is correct - the colonists *were* born Americans, though likely not in the way the commenter intends. \n\nSo when do we get an \"American\" identity? Is it before or after the Revolution? Prior to the Revolution, there's a mixed bag of writings. Certainly someone like John Adams saw himself as very much living in a new nation and a new place. In 1785 (after the Revolution, yes, I know when the American Revolution was), he wrote:\n\n&gt; Neither my father or mother, grandfather or grandmother, great grandfather or great grandmother, nor any other relation that I know of, or care a farthing for, has been in England these one hundred and fifty years; so that you see I have not one drop of blood in my veins but what is American.\n\nIt is abundantly clear that he is defining himself as American in opposition to being English or British. Rather than being a strictly geographical term, \"American\" here is very much being used with the definition of a sense of identity. We see other such thoughts from Thomas Jefferson. In 1774, he wrote in \"Summary View of the Rights of British America:\"\n\n&gt; Let those flatter, who fear: it is not an American art.\n\nonce again defining \"American\" in opposition to British identity. From George Washington, we get: \n\n&gt; The time is now near at hand which must probably determine whether Americans are to be freemen or slaves\n\nwhich while not explicitly stating identity like the previous two quotes, does have the decided implication of identity and what a collective future for the people of the American continent might be. \"Americans\" here means the people of America, and whether they might be allowed to be fully American or if they would instead be slaves to the British Empire. For some of the Founding Fathers, at least, it seems not unreasonable to say that it's likely they saw themselves as uniquely American prior to actual American independence. They saw themselves as having a non-British identity, and they themselves defined it as \"American.\"\n\nHowever, let's bear in mind that Adams, Jefferson, and Franklin do not a nation make, and they don't represent the ideas and identity of the entire population of the Colonies. Adams, certainly, was likely to be more of a rabble-rouser than the average colonist, and probably more likely to see himself as not British, given his political leanings. These quotes by revolutionaries don't even represent the whole of American political thought at the time. There's a vast spectrum of opinion about whether Americans were British or not British, and whether they ought to be those things. \n\nAs an example, I'd like to point to John Dickinson, an esteemed representative from the colony of Pennsylvania to the Continental Congress. He was dead-set on the idea that he and other representatives from the colonies were British and were subjects of the British king. The issue at hand was not one with Britain, but rather an issue with Parliament. Dickinson's writings are full of petitions for reconciliation with Britain and with the assertion that Americans were inherently British, and thus subjects of the king. When it became abundantly clear that independence was happening, he abstained and absented the votes on independence as well as the official wording of the Declaration of Independence. He also chose to leave the Congress rather than sign the Declaration, believing it to be the wrong option, and believing that the colonies needed to seek a non-violent means of resolving their disputes with Britain. Dickinson, certainly, would have been offended at the insinuation that he was a born American with an American identity - he saw himself as British and as a proud British citizen.\n\nDickinson was not alone in seeing himself as a disgruntled Brit rather than a righteously angry citizen of a new nation. The Southern planters and aristocracy in particular were more averse to independence and more likely to see themselves as British rather than American. One example here comes from Benjamin Harrison (no, not that one), who, while eager to participate in the Continental Congress, was also decidedly conservative on the question of independence. He sided with Dickinson in seeking reconciliation with Britain, and was one of the more reluctant signers of the Declaration of Independence (though he did sign it). While it wouldn't be entirely accurate to say that Harrison saw himself as \"British,\" it would be equally inaccurate to say that he say himself as \"American.\" He was \"Virginian,\" campaigning in Congress for increased representation for his colony/state and helping defend it by pleading for its defenses in Congress. \n\nReally, Harrison is not atypical of views of his time, namely that people were people of their particular city, region, or colony first, and a greater political body second. Harrison saw himself as \"Virginian,\" as did many of his colonies (though obviously not all Virginia) because that was his greatest association. An idea of a collective \"American\" identity didn't exist as we understand it before the Revolution. Even afterwards, it wasn't a particularly assured thing. I would argue that the debate about the formation of the country between the Federalists and the anti-Federalists is indicative of a belief not only of where power should come from, but of what mattered most in terms of identity. While Federalists were more likely to see a collective identity and values as important, anti-Federalists were more likely to look at an individual state and see it as the more important consideration, given each state's unique perspective and needs. I'd argue that in the early days of the US, this shows that a collective identity hadn't necessarily been thoroughly established and indeed wouldn't be established until much later. But that's my opinion, and I welcome disagreement with it.\n\nAnyway, even outside politics, the colonists themselves had mixed views about who they were. As was the case with politicians, they were more likely to associate themselves with a city, region, or colony first. While urban newspapers did use the term \"Americans\" - and in spades, especially in Boston - it was being used as a geographical term, coupled with \"his Majesty's subjects\" as a self-referential term. Indeed, for many average people, had they had to choose between identifying as \"American\" and \"British,\" they likely would have chosen British. A collective American identity quite simply didn't exist as we know it. By the 1770s, though, this had shifted, and the answer would be more of a mixed bag. Largely, people like the Sons of Liberty likely saw themselves as subjects of the King, but rebelling against Parliament. Essentially, then, American identity in the colonies was a complex thing, not to be simplified into one camp or another. Some saw themselves as American - especially after the French and Indian War and the Acts that came after it - while others stuck with a British identity. Even those that did rebel might have seen themselves as not in rebellion against Britain, but against the Parliament, a crucial distinction. For those that didn't see themselves as British, even the idea of a uniquely \"American\" identity was a problematic one, being a not entirely clear thing, and certainly not well defined or collective. \n\nSo who's right? Is Obama right in saying that the Founding Fathers became American? Or are commenters right to criticise her? Well, as I said, it's complicated. Some became very much American, defining themselves as such and establishing it as an identity entirely separate and distinct from a British identity. This was the case with people like Franklin and Adams. Others, though, were reluctant Americans at best, and while they did technically become Americans, people like Dickinson likely continued to think of themselves as Americans geographically, but British at heart. For average, everyday people, the spectrum is even broader, with some seeing themselves as American, some as British, but most just looking at where they lived and saying \"Yeah. I'm that. That's me.\" \n\nBasically, history is complex, and identity moreso. In this case, I'd say Obama is more right, but not quite. The idea of \"American\" didn't exist as we know it, but developed over time. Saying the Founding Fathers were the same kind of Americans as modern Americans in terms of their ideological and identity thinking isn't accurate, but nor is it accurate to say they all didn't think of themselves as American. Really, the most generous interpretation is to say that they were American in the sense that they set out to create a nation for themselves based on something new and special, much like all immigrants and naturalised citizens have done. But were they American like we think of today? Probably not. ",

        "text": "First, [the link](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1dh3u8/why_did_generals_in_ww1_think_it_was_a_brilliant/c9qfmi2?context=10000)\n\nNote: Sources will found be in the footnotes\n\nNow, the Badhistory:\n\nIn a discussion about the Lions lead by Donkey's myth, /u/sg92i chimes in with some poorly used and out-of-context factoids about WWI field artillery. Beginning with \n\n&gt; BUT, the basic idea that certain commanders &amp; officers were doing \"stupid\" or \"ignorant\" things is an historical fact that can easily be proven. In the case of the British, there was a very big problem where they would try to use what basically amounted to canaster shot/shrapnal from artillery on field works [the obstacles built between the opposing trenches to make it hard for the enemy to physically cross from one side to the other] like barb wire. This did not work. It never worked, and it never would have worked. Yet the British tried it time and time again during the war.\n\nThis is patently false. Haig, French, Foch, Petain, Joffre *et al* were not stupid; they were forced to use tactics that were inadequate because of materiel shortages. In his excellent work (well worth a read for anyone), Strachan excerpts the following dispatch of Haig's:\n\n&gt; \"1. The defenses on our front are so carefully and so strongly made, and mutual support with machine-guns is so complete, that in order to demolish them a *long methodical bombardment* will be necessary be heavy artillery (guns and howitzers) before Infantry are sent forward to attack. \n&gt; \n&gt; \"2. To destroy the enemy's 'material' 60p[ounde]r. *guns* will be tried, as well as the 15-in[ch], 9.2 and 6-in[ch] siege how[itzer]s. Accurate observations of *each shot* will be arranced so as to make sure of flattening out the enemy's 'strong points' of support, before the infantry is launched\"\n \nFurther down, Strachan notes the following on the armaments situation circa 1915:\n&gt; \"While Germany and France grappled with maintaining their existing numbers of field guns, the British Ministry of Munitions cut back on the output of lighter guns by 28 per cent, while increasing that of medium calibers by 380 per cent and of heavy artillery by 1,200 per cent. From the very outset, even Cavalrymen like Haig and French, were dedicated to using weight of material and sophisticated technology in the pursuit of breakthrough.\"^1\n\nThe dispatch, and the focus on heavy artillery, not field guns, show clearly that the focus of British artillery was not on shrapnel and canister shot, as sg92i claims, but on heavy shell to blast away the German earthworks. Furthermore, it was primarily the French who were infatuated with shrapnel and canister, with their French 75 issued significantly more shrapnel than HE at the beginning of the war.^2 \n\nHis point on shooting canister at barb wire is technically correct, but shrapnel is probably adequate, as there is the explosive charge to fragment the shell, as well as the fragments themselves.\n\nMoving on to the next problem area, we find:\n&gt; After failing to clear the field works using artillery in this manner, the British would then order their units over the top, while pretending that the field works like barb wire had been cleared [when this was not the case]. Their forces would then get tangled up in the field works, while the Germans would fire artillery on them and kill hoards of them at a time. This is why the British lost 10 percent more of their casualties in the war to artillery than the Germans suffered [75 versus 65 per-cent]. Most British casualties never got close enough to the opposite trench to get killed by rifles, machine guns, or bayonets. They rarely got close enough to even see their enemy. Its the big guns that did the majority of the killing, in no small part because of these blunders.\n\nI'll just go and say it: The British were not very good at clearing barb wire; it's not really sensible to try with artillery until the Graze fuse in 1917. Previous fuses tended not to reliably detonate the shell in the mud of Flanders, and had delay issues in drier climates that resulted in the shell becoming buried slightly below the ground before exploding, which is not very effective for killing people on top of the ground.^3\n\nI think it is certainly safe to say that unless one has a Bangalore torpedo (basically a tube full of explosive that is used to clear barbed wire), wire will slow any assault, not just the British. Furthermore, the German use of artillery was only mediocre at best, later beaten by the sheer amount of fire that the British could bring down. \n\nOn his statistics, I have no idea where he got them, nor where to find ones to rebut them, so I'll just look at them with one eyebrow raised. \n\nThe problem of not seeing the enemy was nothing new; In Howard's *Men Against Fire*, he notes that in the Boer War, British units advancing in close order were often decimated by rifle fire by \"the fire of Boer defenses they could not even see, let alone get close enough to assault\"^4\n\nTheir point on about artillery doing much of the killing is reasonably accurate, although if someone were to provide reliable statistics saying otherwise, I would of course concede the point.\n\n/u/sg92i then quotes some sources about the Somme, particularly the first day. \n\n\n&gt; Mosier, for his faults, has this to say in Myth of the Great War, \"...three out of every four shells fired by this gun [18 pounder] were shrapnel, and almost one third of the high explosive shells fired by the British gunners failed to explode... when the infantry began their attach [speaking of Somme], they found that the German wire was largely untouched and the German defenders largely unscathed.\"[234]\nPaul Dickson's research into Crerar concluded in A Thoroughly Canadian General, \"The failure to cut the wire was also costly in men's lives. Close to 60,000 British and colonial troopers were killed and wounded on 1 July alone, many as they struggled to find gaps in wire uncut and were decimated by German defenders, shaken, but not harmed by the proceeding week-long bombardment.\"[52]\n\nI am unsure why they are quoting Mosier; there are literally tens of thousands of other books on the subject, many of which are less-revisionist. Strachan is a particularly outstanding example, and if I remember correctly, Keegan's history is quite good. \n\nStrachan describes the Somme as a battle for which \"the British artillery was not ready. The 4th Army had over 1,437 guns available to it ... [but t]he effect was scattered, especially as only 182 of the 4th Army's guns were heavy.\"^5\n\nHe sums up the battle with \"In truth it [Somme] should have been closed down. The learning process which the British army's high command was passing through did pay dividends in 1918, but its route there need not have been so sanguinary.\"^6\n\nNext, we have\n\n&gt; G. C. Peden alleged in Arms, Economics, and British Strategy from Dreadnoughts to Hydrogen Bombs that this obsession with using shrapnel was because \"... the General Staff doubted whether artillery would play a major part in any future European war and preferred light, shrapnel firing guns suitable for use against men in the open. The shortage of high-explosive shells that the army was to experience in 1914-1915 was thus partly as a result of military doctorine.\"[28]\n\n&gt; The soldiers themselves knew this *was* stupidity and ignorance, and this can be substantiated by looking to the fall out over Aubers Ridge. Where, like at Somme, the British artillery shells chosen by the commanders were worthless against field works, and equally worthless against fortifications. The grunts were tired of having to sacrifice themselves after their officers misused ordnance, failed to achieve results with ordnance, and then ordered futile advances. So they did the only sensible thing they could: They complained to civilian reporters who took the story home and shocked the home front with stories of worthless shrapnel shells &amp; shortages of H.E. The public demanded something be done. Dale Rielage explained in Russian Supply Efforts In America During the First World War that so the Asquith government was sacked, a coalition cabinet was formed, and Lloyd George was made minister of munitions [33-34]. Eventually the British were able to turn things around, and supply a reasonable amount of HE to the front. But not until late '17, *some three years* after the war began and countless officers had be dragged kicking &amp; screaming into the new policy of using them.\n\nHmm. Where to begin?\n\n/u/sg92i, and Peden, are blowing a very small cause of the shell-shortage of '14-'15 way out of proportion; the main factor was the rapid shifts in employment caused by the war, and the demand massively outpacing the production capacity of the factories; more shifts and more facilities were eventually added and built, increasing capacity, which alleviated the shortage; military meddling in supply was much less of an issue in Britain, with the Ministry of Munitions, than in Germany or Russia, who lacked similar bodies to regulate industry cooperation with the war effort.\n\nNext, it was not so much the use of shrapnel, which is a carefully designed variant of a high explosive shell, but the poor quality of British fuses, that caused such high dud rates. Kramer, in *Dynamic of Destruction*, has the following to say:\n\n\"Yet on 1 July the French achieved all their objectives in the southern sector of the Somme, for comparatively light losses (some 7,000 men). This suggests that the 'first day of the Somme' has become a kind of trauma in British national memory that has obscured the real history of the battle, as Gary Sheffield and other historians have recently argued. The entire course of the four and a half-month battle should be considered, not only the first day, as part of a steep learning curve for the British army, at the end of which it had become a highly trained, well-equipped, and effective fighting force which succeeded in taking the initiative away from Germany and restoring mobility to warfare in 1917 and 1918.\"^7\n\nAs for exact numbers of shells the British had, I have no idea where to find those; maybe at Kew? On the other hand, the usage of HE before Somme, in 1916, and even Aubers Ridge, in 1915, invalidates his own point; I would hardly call millions of shells a less-than-reasonable amount. \n\nNext post time!\n\n&gt; What happened to him was not uncommon. From the 1890s-1930s any officer who advocated for HE ordnance was punished severely from the top down. They'd either be forced to resign, which is what happened to Secretary of the Navy Metcalf, or they'd be blacklisted and never be promoted again [See Capt. Lewis], or they'd be court martialed on trumped up charges [Capt. Knight].\n\n*Good God, what have I gotten myself into this time?*\n\nI would like to see some sources; unfortunately, as this is a year old, I can't readily ask /u/sg92i. Darn. I can assure you, dear reader, than officers advocating for the use of high-explosive ordinance were not severely punished; the mere concept is ridiculous, and more absurd at the time, coming out of World War One, a great deal of which was fought with high-explosive shells and bombs. This point is almost nonsensical, unless I am completely wrong about US munitions policy in the period mentioned. \n\nMoving on to something that may actually drive me to despair for humanity:\n\n&gt; Ahhh, that is the big question. The part no one ever talks about.\n\nIn reference to why the US was apparently so anti-HE that you would face a court-martial if you so much as muttered \"Amatol\"\n\n&gt; It would be easy to say arrogance, something about the British seeing themselves as the most powerful country on the planet &amp; being able to destroy anyone they want. Maybe say something about the US [manifest destiny, and the idea that god is on our side or something like that].\n\nTo be honest, I have no idea what they are getting at here. It's probably commentary on geopolitics, but don't trust it; it's too vague\n\n&gt; But I don't believe that's it.\n\nThat's nice, because what you are about to say can't get worse than vague undated commentary about the *simple*, *uncomplicated* geopolitics of the turn of the 20th century. \n\n&gt; I suspect what it was really all about was battleships.\n\nOh dear lord why. At least I can deal with this.\n\n&gt; The whole theory behind battleships was that if you make a giant ship, it becomes a gun platform you can then use to destroy things [other ships, coastal cities/ports etc]. But big ships are sloooow, they're big targets so they're easy to hit with something, and they're really expensive so you never want to loose one.\n\nWait, so once [this](http://www.haig-brown.com/hottips/images/468b.jpg) is completed, it turns into one of [these](http://www.navsource.org/archives/01/012819.jpg)?\n\nObviously that is both not the case and not the point of their argument, but the fallacy needs to be pointed out. Their argument here is that battleships are slow, expensive, big (and therefore easy to hit), and you don't want to have yours turn into very poorly designed submarines.\n\nFirst, big ships are not slow. While a ULCC can only go about 15 knots (one knot is roughly 1.2 miles an hour, so about 18 mph), the 1911-vintage USS New York (BB-34) could do 21 knots, and the great greyhounds of the sea that were the *Iowa*-class could do up to 35 knots, or well over 40 miles an hour. The reason for this is simple: a ULCC, such as the *Knock Nevis/Jahre Viking*, is powered by either a diesel engine or steam turbine of about 50,000 horsepower, and displaces about 650,000 tons. An Iowa-class battleship displaces 60-65,000 tons, depending on load, and has about 212,000 horsepower. \n\n&gt; So a battleship needs, by definition, to be covered with absurd amounts of armor to keep it alive. This is supposed to make a battleship indestructible. Our WW2 era warships were able to survive atomic bombs. Sure, the crew would die from radiation, but they are that strong.\n\nThe first sentence is correct. \n\nThe second sentence is not. A battleship is not designed to be indestructable; that is physically impossible. They are designed to be a tough nut to crack, so to speak. \n\nThe third sentence is not correct; the DoD applied such a rating after WWII.\n\nThe fourth sentence is not correct; the crew would be shielded by the foot or so of steel between them and the blast, which should theoretically allow them to probably survive for much longer than if they were outside the ship; nobody has tested this, so it is not known what happens when you nuke a battleship with the crew on board. \n\n&gt; But then what happens when a battleship fights a battleship? A stalemate that goes on until they both run out of shells or get bored? To solve this problem the AP [armor piercing] round was developed. Its a heavy shell with a special cap that allows it to punch threw naval armor. But, the AP round only works effectively at point blank range [shhh! don't tell anyone, this was seriously classified back then]. Battleships did engage each other all the time, and usually could not harm each other because AP back then was worthless. It was even less effective against coastal fortifications! In the Spanish-American War the US Navy could not destroy any of the coastal defense forts at Cuba, nor could we sink the Spanish fleet at Cuba. We tried. What we ended up doing was setting fire to their ships, forcing the crews to abandon them. Even then, the ships would not sink. In the Russo-Japanese War the Russians had a fleet at Port Arthur. The Japanese fleet tried to destroy them over and over again, neither side could get anywhere. The shells would literally bounce off without doing any damage.\n\nDamn it! I thought that this was getting less incorrect. **sigh**\n\nHere's the armor penetration tables for the 14\" gun off of quite a few US battleships, courtesy of Navweaps:\n\n**Armor Penetration with 1,400 lbs. (635 kg) AP Shell**\n\nRange | Side Armor |\n---|---|----\n6,000 yards (5,490 m)\t | 17.2\" (437 mm)\n9,000 yards (8,230 m) | 14.4\" (366 mm)\n12,000 yards (10,920 m) | 11.9\" (302 mm)\n16,000 yards (14,630 m) | 8.9\" (226 mm)\n20,000 yards (18,290 m) | 6.7\" (170 mm)\n\nNote:  This data is for face-hardened (Harvey) plates and is from BuOrd table \"Elements of US Naval Guns\" of 17 May 1918.\n\n**Armor Penetration with 1,500 lbs. (680.40 kg) AP Mark 16 Shell:**\n\nRange (yards) | Side Armor (in) | Deck Armor (in)\n---|---|----\n11,500 | 18 | ?\n13,500 | ? | 2\n14,800 | 16 | ?\n18,800 | 14 | ?\n23,400 | 12 | ?\n25,500 | ? | 4\n28,300 | 10 | ?\n31,500 | ? | 6\n34,300 | 8 | ?\n36,300 | ? | 8\n\n1) These figures are taken from armor penetration curves issued in 1942.\n\nAs we can see, even a middle-of-the-road gun is more than capable of knocking out an enemy ship from extreme ranges; one would be hard pressed to find a target with eight inches of deck armor, save for a capsized heavy cruiser, and most ships had between 12 and 14\" of belt (side) armor.\n\nAP rounds are extremely effective against concrete and the like; the shell can penetrate into the concrete before exploding, thereby causing significantly more damage than if it had detonated against the wall of a fortification. \n\nThe example given concerning the Spanish-American war is more likely to be attributable to the absolutely awful quality of gun direction at the time; it was mostly guesswork, from what I have read. \n\nAll I have to say about the Russo-Japanese war is Tsushima Straight and Yellow Sea. \n\nBoth battles were fought at very long ranges by battleships, and both had several ships sunk (mostly Russian) by fire from battleship main guns. I unfortunately do not have my sources on this sort of thing with me, but Tsushima isn't some obscure battle; if you are talking about battleships, mention the Russo-Japanese War, and *don't* talk about Tsushima, it sets off klaxons and warning bells and stuff. \n\nAlso, AP Shells don't bounce very well unless hitting a sloped surface, and none of the ships at Tsushima had an inclined armor belt. \n\n&gt; As long as the big ships were indestructible, the navy was happy because they could keep building bigger &amp; better ones. The legislators, who order contracts were happy because it created jobs &amp; made a lot of people really really wealthy. The tax payers were happy because they had jobs, and felt safe &amp; secure. The army felt happy because they could any time they wanted to, put a section of naval armor on shore 10 yards in front of a cannon, destroy it with an AP shell in front of reporters &amp; congressmen, and then get to buy more cannon. It didn't matter that it was a big farce!\n\nThe first statement, dubious claims of indestructibility aside, is usually true. The US Navy did want more battleships. The next sentence is also true, but unfortunately, because battleships were constructed (at least in the US) by Navy-owned shipyards, the second clause is not true. Taxpayers had very little say in this sort of thing, unless they were Ottoman, in which case they crowd-funded a battleship in 1914. The Army would be hard-pressed to find anything to penetrate even 2\" of STS or Class A plate before 1936, and even by '45, would not be able to get through 6 or 8\" of what was at the time the best armor steel on earth. It was most certainly not a big farce, as Jutland, Surigao Strait, and nearly every US Amphibious landing from 1941 onward showed. \n\n&gt; But then HE came along. Unlike AP, which only works at point blank, HE doesn't care what the range is because the explosive power does all the damage. The shell doesn't even need to hit the ship to damage it, it just has to get close enough for the explosion to do its work. HE can also be packaged anyway you'd like. Want to put it in a mine and just throw it overboard for someone to sail into it? You can do that. And it won't even cost much. Want to shoot it out of a cannon? You can do that. Want to fire a torpedo from a small, cheap boat or a submarine? No problem. You could even get someone like General Billy Mitchell to throw some bombs off the side of a plane and do some damage. Planes are cheap. Battleships cost fortunes! Worse, HE gets even more effective if the explosion happens underwater because water doesn't like to compress.\n\nYes, HE works at all ranges. Unfortunately, it can not penetrate armor. The rest of this paragraph is technically correct, but HE was not exactly new stuff; Dynamite was invented in the 1880s.\n\n&gt; Battleships you see, are only heavily armored where AP rounds are likely to hit them. In other words: the gun turrets, the bridge [of later ships], or the sides +/- a few feet of the water line. It doesn't matter if an AP round pierces the ship elsewhere. It'll be too far off the waterline to cause it to sink, and AP rounds have to be so strong that they carry little explosive, so there's no worry of it doing much once it punches threw a noncritical part of a ship's superstructure.\n\nMore schlock! \n\nNo, battleships are not only armored where AP rounds are likely to hit them; they are armored where the important stuff is. On American ships, which mostly follow an All-or-Nothing armor scheme, vital areas are protected extremely heavily, while the decks and major bulkheads are made of 1\" or 2\" STS, which is armor steel. This acts as spaced armor, and tears the ballistic cap off the projectile. \n\n&gt; Which means if a submarine launches a torpedo and it explodes near the ship's bottom, its fucked. The water won't compress, the full force of the explosion will rip apart the hall and it will sink. FAST. If a plane drops a bomb on a ship, it will breech the deck, where there isn't much armor, and explode deep inside the ship. If it explodes deep enough, the hull will rip open and it will sink. If it hits the magazine the ship's done for [See: Pearl Harbor]. So HE is a big risk to battleships, its flexible, and its cheap. Very cheap.\n\nThis is technically correct, but most armor penetrating bombs, particularly Japanese bombs, were battleship shells with fins welded on; normal general-purpose bombs would have very little effect on 4-6\" of STS or Class A plate, as the blast would follow the path of least resistance, ie not towards the steel. \n\n&gt; Oh, and did I mention every navy on the planet is deeply afraid of explosive compounds? Yeah, see there was this problem back then where stored explosives like gun cotton would spontaniously detonate and destroy a battleship. That's likely what destroyed the USS Maine, its what destroyed the Japanese warship Kawachi, and every nation has some story about how its bad news. If you switch from AP to HE, you have to carry more of the stuff.\n\nNot really. The bulk of explosives on a ship are the propellant for the shells, which, for the 14\" gun mentioned previously, is 425 pounds, compared to a bursting charge of either 22.9 or 104 pounds, for AP or HE, respectively. Also, the bursting charge in a shell is usually behind a few inches of steel, compared to the propellant, which was in a bag designed to burn very, very well; propellant was much more likely to explode randomly than any shell. Think about it: if you drop a cigarette on a steel shell, it goes out. If you drop it on a silk bag with 110 pounds of explosives in it, you have maybe three seconds to make your peace with the world. \n\n&gt; If congress knew what HE could do, then they'd question whether or not we should buy all these expensive battleships. That makes the navy unhappy. The steel industry, that makes these ships, gets unhappy and have to lay off their workers. Now, the taxpayers, who elect congress, are unhappy because not only are they out of work; they're afraid some European country like France, England, or Germany will show up and start destroying New York City because we have nothing that can survive HE. Chaos, society falls apart, the economy crashes, total anarchy, people start eating their children to survive.... no one wants that.\n\nHey, hypothetical bullshit! Also, nobody was seriously considering attacking New York; the mystical powers that this person attributes to HE are somewhat ridiculous; any battleship in the United States Navy circa 1914 would be able to survive an HE shell fired at it; to argue otherwise disregards the entire concept of armoring a ship, and shows a gross misunderstanding of the subject at hand. \n\n&gt; So all the key players end up in cahoots with each other, due to their own selfish interests. This doesn't effect Russia, because most of their ships they bought from Britain anyway. No loss of jobs, no big deal. Same for Japan. Germany doesn't care, because they know if they turn to HE first they'll have first strike capability and be able to quickly defeat anyone they want to. That's part of what made the '14 offensive such a big deal even in the United States. Germany went against the honors system and opened pandora's box.\n\n\n\n\n&gt; Technically Japan did, at the Battle of Tsushima where they destroyed the entire Russian Navy. But, we were letting that one fly because everyone saw the Russians as weak and backwards back then, and its not like the Russo-Japanese war upset the power players [Germany, France, England] or their economies.\n\nAm I hallucinating, or did /u/sg92i not fail to mention the battle of Tsushima when it did not support his point?\n\nAlso, the Russo-Japanese War was extremely important militarily, as it was extremely influential on the tactics of the first year of war or so. \n\n&gt; Maybe I'm just cynical.\n\nOr you just don't know what you're talking about?\n\nBUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE\n\nMY LIVER MAY GIVE OUT IN SOLIDARITY HERE\n\n&gt; The United States didn't possess any HE shells until the tail end of WW1, so I am confused as to what you mean here?\n\nHoly shit this is wrong. \n\nThere were HE shells for US naval guns going back to at least 1856 (thanks, Dahlgren!)\n\n\n&gt; a HE shell exploding against 12 inches of steel will do little besides scratch the paint\nThat was actually a myth spread in the early 20th century by AP proponents. It was heavily debunked back then as being untrue, in several ordnance experiments including one from 1898 at Indian Head which was covered by the NY Scientific American where a 500lb payload of wet gun cotton was able to completely destroy a 17 inch section of gun turret armor [the thickest &amp; strongest armor on the entire planet at the time].\n\nWell, funny thing, armor steel in 1898 was not the same as armor steel in 1900, or 1910, or 1918. That, and putting 500 pounds of guncotton next to a piece of steel is in no way representative of a realistic test scenario. Furthermore, no weapon in 1898 could loft 500 pounds of explosive, much less hit anything with it. \n\n&gt; What the US Ordnance Bureau had found was that in older ordnance tests, where a section of armor was placed upright [backed by timber, railcars, and/or sand] and fired upon at point blank range, the HE explosions were throwing the target around in ways that are not realistic nor in any way comparable to what happens when a real ship is being shot at. They theorized that if they placed an armor section against a cliff and backed it with clay, so it could not move during the explosion, the explosion's affects would more closely relate to what would happen under real combat conditions. Sure enough, as soon as they allowed the targets to be unmovable the HE payloads would destroy them quite easily.\n\nNo. Just no. When you want to destroy a chunk of steel, you use an AP shell; it's *Armor Piercing* for a reason. High explosive shells are not designed to go through, or even destroy, armor plate. I also would like to see the writeup of the tests referenced, as I have never heard of them, despite relatively extensive reading on the subject. Unfortunately, as the thread is a year old, that's probably not going to happen, so take them with a grain of salt, and remember that most of what this person has said has been wrong or poorly interpreted.\n\n&gt; Basically what happened was in the late 1880s the Germans started trying to find a way to defeat fortifications using explosive projectiles, and developed a shell that would borrow into the ground before detonating a large payload. This created a major crisis in Europe, the French called it the \"Torpedo Shell Crisis.\" Everyone knew Europe's forts were relying on earth to protect their garrisons so if a shell could go into the ground and explode a large charge, it would render these forts worthless. It was this technological breakthrough that prompted the construction of all those fortified cities in western Europe in places like France and Belgium.\n\nOh sweet jesus, this makes no sense. I'm sketchy on late 19th century artillery, but this sounds not correct, especially considering that the fortified towns of had been fortified for a couple of hundred years at that point. \n\n&gt; While that fort construction was going on and western Europe was in full on panic mode, an American engineer wanting to get into armament design was touring Europe and came home to the United States to design the first real HE shell. His name was Gathmann, and he called his HE projectiles \"Torpedo Shells\" in honor of the fear the Germans had put into Europe with their new borrowing shell.\n\nIf we look at [this article from Vol. 116 of Scientific American](http://books.google.com/books?id=CbsxAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22Louis%20Gathmann%22%20gun%20%22Sandy%20Hook%22&amp;pg=PA591#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Louis%20Gathmann%22%20gun%20%22Sandy%20Hook%22&amp;f=false), see the following words:\n\n&gt; The death of Louis Gathmann at the age of 74 recalls to mind the indefatigable labors of this inventor in the development of the high explosive shell which bore his name. It was Mr Gathmann's belief that it was not necessary to carry the high explosive shell through armor plate and the interior of a ship but that if a sufficient quantity were detonated against the outside of a ship it would be equally if not more destructive. He secured from Congress an appropriation for an 18 inch gun capable throwing a shell containing 500 pounds of guncotton. Army and Navy officers held that the only effective would be one of the armor piercing type provided with a delayed action fuse which would burst the shell of the armor. Both types were tested at Sandy about eighteen years ago. **The armor piercing shell penetrated an 11 inch plate and tore the backing to pieces. The Gathmann shell burst against the face of the plate failed to do more than dent it in the earlier rounds cracking it in two in the last round.** The superiority of the armor piercing shell was thus established.\n\nNote where it debunks most, if not all, of his claims.\n\n[Again, this time from Collier's:](http://books.google.com/books?id=HokjAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22Louis%20Gathmann%22%20gun%20%22Sandy%20Hook%22&amp;pg=PA536#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Louis%20Gathmann%22%20gun%20%22Sandy%20Hook%22&amp;f=false)\n\n&gt; The 18 inch gun invented by Louis Gathmann was tested in the presence of United States army officers at the Sandy Hook proving grounds November 15. A shell containing 500 pounds of wet guncotton was discharged against a target of face-hardened steel similar to that used on the turrets of the battleship Illinois. **It was expected that this shell would destroy the target, but it only dented it.** The Gathmann gun is 44 feet long and weighs 59 tons. The projectile is 71 inches long and weighs 1,830 pounds 500 of which are wet guncotton. A second inconclusive test was made November 16.\n\nAgain demonstrating the inefficacy of high explosive on armor steel by using his sources is fun, don't you think?\n\n&gt; As soon as this new type of shell debuted, Willard Isham and the Maxim family [same ones who designed the famous Maxim machine gun] got to work making their own versions of a Torpedo Shell.\n\nThat's nice!\n\n&gt; So what is a torpedo shell? Basically it was a shell that was built just like a torpedo [used in the water, by ships] only altered so that instead of being self propelled &amp; launched out of a tube, it is fired out of a gun like any other shell would be. It is as light weight as possible, with less than an inch of metal to its sides. The giant cavity inside it is then filled with explosive compounds of some such [you had many options in what you could put inside it].\n\nThat sounds suspiciously like poorly-designed High Explosive, Plastic or High Explosive Squash Head anti-tank rounds, which work very differently to what this person has been saying\n\n&gt; The point of firing it out of a gun was so that you could use it against targets that an aquatic torpedo can't touch. Like a fortification on land, or a gun turret on a ship, or a ship's superstructure, or anything on or under the water like a ship's hull. It was far more flexible, and had a range of about 18,000 yards at a time when most torpedoes could only work for about 4,000 yards, and when AP shells would only be effective to about 6,000 yards.\n\nDo tell what year it is, because there was a revolution in naval gunfire, instigated by Jackie Fisher, circa 1910, that enabled gunners to accurately hit targets at ranges of 17-25,000 yards, and in extreme cases up to 35,000 yards. \n\n&gt; A Torpedo Shell could carry a crazy amount of explosive. To test these shells the US military used our 12-inch guns, with which they could easily fire 500 to 900 lb sized payloads. That's for a tiny 12 inch gun. The larger the gun, the size of the payload could be increased exponentially. This is why the German siege guns they used in the '14 offensive were so absurdly big. The Big Bertha was a whooping 42-cm diameter howitzer. That's big. Believe it had the distinction of being the largest diameter cannon fired in combat on land. By the end of WW1, when countries started having 15+ inch naval cannon, it would have been easy to fire thousand plus pound Torpedo Shells.\n\nFirst, 500-900 pounds is what is normally expected in a 12\" shell. \nSecond, it's not exponential, it's not exactly formulaeic, either. \nThird, Big Bertha had a range of barely 13,000 yards, pathetic by naval gunfire standards (although not by German standards, but that is another can of worms)\nFourth, the largest bore cannon to see land combat was the 80cm railroad guns of the Nazis.\nFifth, that was in the middle of the war, and I still see no difference between the weight of a torpedo shell and a normal shell. \n\n&gt; Since these shell casings were so thin they were cheaper &amp; easier to mass produce them. The Japanese had no way of making their own shells going into the Russo-Japanese War. They were being supplied with AP rounds by the British until they turned to Torpedo Shells, which they could make at home. They also did not suffer from tumbling in flight [something that renders AP worthless even at point blank], which comes in handy if your big guns become damaged or worn out before you can refit them. When the Japanese blew up a third of their own guns at the Battle of Round Island that was it. They had no way to repair them since the ships were British made and they had no domestic warship building infrastructure yet. They tried to repair them before Tsushima but could not do so, so they used their HE [torpedo shells] in them instead of AP, and the Russians watched the shells tumble in the air and laughed saying \"their guns must be worn out, we have nothing to worry about! The shells can't even hurt us!\"\n\nUnfortunately for /u/sg92i, the Japanese were using plain old HE shells, which are subject to the principles of ballistics, unlike these magical 'torpedo shells' they speak of. Fortunately, the Japanese shells were extremely effective in lighting the coal stored on the decks of the Russian ships on fire, which contributed to the sinking of the Russian fleet. \n\n&gt; Then the torpedo shells started hitting them and blowing apart their hulls. According to Semenoff the Russian flagship was hit by one HE shell and it ripped a hole in the side so large two or three horses could have been galloped abreast of each other threw the size of the opening. When AP hits, you get a neat, small, perfectly round hole from where it punches threw. If this hole is above the water it does no real damage to a ship's ability to fight. Not so with torpedo shells. They blast away the sides of ships and crack hulls apart.\n\nSo, it turns out that \n\n&gt; By WW1 the term \"Torpedo Shell\" became archaic and fell into disuse, the \"new\" name [WW1 onward] for them is \"High Explosive Shells.\" Those 3 inventors I mentioned? Since the US and Britain, their home countries, would not buy the concept they sold them to the Japanese and Germans. It is for that reason that the Germans acquired the designs behind the Big Bertha, and for that reason the offensive of 1914 was allowed to happen. Without the Big Bertha there would have been no 1914 offensive. The germans would not have had a percieved first strike capability and would not have been in such a rush to fight, because they would not have been able to anticipating taking the fortified cities in Belgium like Liege.\n\nThe idea of the offensive in 1914 was based on the principles determined by the German General Staff, principally Von Schlieffen and Von Moltke; I have no idea what this person is saying about a first strike capability, because the concept was not in existence yet; the Germans couldn't neutralize the French or Belgians from Germany. \n\n&gt; If you can't take cities like Liege, you can't get to Paris in time. If you can't get to Paris in time you're stuck in the two front war the Schlieffen's Plan had hoped to avoid. Schlieffen's Plan is a plan of using torpedo shells on land to make a mad dash to Paris. This the very core of what started World War One!\n\nNo, Schlieffen's plan concerned more the operational-level (so corps and army) movements of units than the tactical employment of specific technology. \n\nWhy World War One was started is one of the largest debates in military history, and I've got 38,700 and some characters here, out of 40,000, so I'm going to say to read Stachan, Massie, and Keegan, and maybe some more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes:\n\n1.

I cannot even express the feeling of weary dread I felt when seeing that this commercial even exists, to say nothing of what it would inevitably invite by being posted to Reddit.\n\nI will say, first of all, that [the commercial](http://youtu.be/NWF2JBb1bvM) was indeed well-made.  Excellent production values, essentially well-acted, not even necessarily poorly-conceived.  There are naturally any number of comments (most massively downvoted) declaring this use of the war by a large department store chain to be tasteless and disgusting, but it should be acknowledged that the piece was made in co-operation with the Royal British Legion, with the new old-fashioned chocolate bar at the centre of the commercial being sold to raise funds for the Legion's charitable work.  All proceeds from the campaign are to be donated.\n\nSo why did I feel such dread?\n\nWell, what else should I feel at the prospect of the most overly sentimentalized event of the war being used for commercial purposes in a piece of film that will then be commented upon by Redditors?  I almost didn't bother -- but I could not resist.\n\nA mercifully downvoted comment sums up everything that I hate about everything:\n\n&gt; Very cynical and in poor taste. The only way this could have worked was to see the soldiers blown to pieces moments later, rather than 'Christmas is for sharing' - what bullshit. Most of these guys would have been dead within weeks/months. The truce ended because the generals were terrified at such fraternisation Better to watch OH WHAT A LOVELY WAR instead and remember that the whole war was a disaster, a slaughter of young working class people who were seen as cannon fodder , the destruction of a whole generation of men, rather than try to sell a supermarket and wrap yourself in both the flag and hollow sentimentality. See the same incident, but made by a filmmaker with integrity, here: [Oh what a lovely war!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHObCL2luMw). Marketing people are the worst.\n\nThis is almost like a parody -- like someone took every stale, underexamined complaint about the war and threw it all together in a blender and then just posted whatever came out, garbled and all.\n\n&gt; \"...blown to pieces moments later...\"  \n\nThis is a surprisingly common sentiment throughout the thread; \"and then they went right back to shooting each other,\" etc.  Some step in to note that they were ordered to by superiors who were not keen to see this collapse of morale fester any further, but the obvious military rectitude of this is immediately thrown under the bus of sentiment.  In any case, it simply is not true that they would all have been \"blown to pieces moments later.\"  Many sectors where truce events happened, and in which superior officers were not sufficiently able to re-establish order, saw a continued dithering of hostilities over the 26th and even up to the New Year.  Not every sector was a hot one anyway, so even this full resumption of hostilities would have looked quite muted in many places.  There's a reason that the major offensives of the war were planned for the spring and summer months; attacking in December is not exactly ideal.\n\n&gt; \"The truce ended because the generals were terrified of such fraternisation.\"  \n\nWell, \"terrified\" is rather a strong word, and it wasn't just the generals (those loathsome icons!) who were worried about the prospect.  Even commanding officers in the trenches themselves were uneasy about the truces, given the chaos they sowed and the ultimate collapse of morale that they threatened, and we certainly have many records of troops on all sides who responded to truce events in 1914 with gunfire, and were glad to have done so.  Civilians -- from statesmen down to the man in the street -- also had cause to fear what events like these presaged, given the likelihood of them prolonging the war rather than concluding it efficiently.  The widescale mobilization of civilian populations to contribute to the war effort essentially demanded that the militant arm of that effort keep up its own work; workers making shells, sewing clothes, manufacturing rations, and so on, did not have the liberty of any sort of \"Christmas Truce,\" and would likely have balked at the prospect of taking one.  Knowing that the men they were breaking their backs to supply were just fucking around instead of fighting to a finish would not be a happy prospect.  \n\nFinally, I should note that no matter what \"the generals\" may have liked to do on the Western Front, the likelihood of the truce meaningfully enduring without their attempts to stop it are very miniscule indeed.  One good reason for this is the division of responsibilities and of distance that existed between the infantry and artillery arms of the army.  Artillery officer memoirs reported far, far fewer encounters with any sort of truce events, given their remove from direct contact with the enemy firing line, and many reported thinking it was a joke when first they got the news.  What of the days to come?  The 26th comes around, the batteries open up -- and suddenly there's a frantic telephone call from the captain a kilometer ahead of them saying \"stop that bloody firing, there's a truce on!\"  What are they even supposed to do?\n\n&gt; \"Better to watch OH WHAT A LOVELY WAR instead...  See the same incident, but made by a filmmaker with integrity, here: [Oh what a lovely war!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHObCL2luMw)\"  \n\nThe only sense in which this is true is that it has better production values.  In no sense, however, is it a good film to watch as an accurate examination of the events of the First World War.  It is as nakedly a piece of propaganda as it is possible to be, and the fact that this user seems to think it's a product of total integrity is just astounding to me.  It is a musical comedy.  It is both a satire of the war's contemporary propaganda and a piece of modern propaganda in its own right.  The historical consultant for the play and film, the former Labour MP Raymond Fletcherr, boasted that *Lovely*'s message was \"one part [him], one part Liddell Hart, the rest Lenin.\"  [My complaints about Liddell Hart](http://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1pq02a/hearken_back_to_precolonialist_india_the_idea_of/cd4wbkg) have been aired elsewhere, and Lenin's apparent  (if abstract) influence on the film's portrayal of the war should likely cause concern.  As for Fletcher himself, the release of the Mitrokhin Archive in 1992 revealed that the late Fletcher had in fact been a Soviet spy.  Dan Todman has considerably more to say about the film's genesis [here](http://www.warhistorian.org/todman.php). \n\n&gt; \"...and remember that the whole war was a disaster, a slaughter of young working class people who were seen as cannon fodder, the destruction of a whole generation of men...\"\n\nFor fuck's sake.\n\nMy rather atypical opinions about the actual merits of the Christmas Truce have already been aired amid considerable controversy, so I should probably just stop here, for now.",

        "text": "This will probably earn a contemptible low-effort tag, but my God: I am too annoyed by this not to post it here, but also too busy to give it the attention it deserves.\n\nA lot of political cartoons get posted in /r/Canada; [this one from yesterday](http://np.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/2lyp9q/remember_who_they_still_are_in_spirit/) generated more than the usual amount of discussion.  It largely stems from the thread's top comment, which is the usual thing about the gnostic privilege of combat experience, the rich sending the poor off to die, veterans heroically repudiating medals, the true meaning of etc.  People are welcome to their opinions even when they are not ones I share, but I find this all rather dull.\n\nBut this thread... this fucking thread.  \n\nAlready in [another submission](http://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2m0vrd/myths_about_the_myths_about_ww1/) today in /r/BadHistory, we've seen a certain amount of justifiable fatigue at the constant stream of \"FWW was futile/pointless/stupid/etc.\" pieces being released.  This is, I think, one of the problems with mainstream civilian engagement with military history; in no other field would such completely unqualified people be allowed to pontificate on professional and often technical matters so pompously, and in no other field would it be not only permitted but encouraged to simply say the same goddamn thing about the subject with every passing year.  People making posts like these or writing articles like the one addressed in the other BH thread seem not to know or care that FWW scholarship has changed considerably since the 1960s and 70s; there are entire new schools of research about the war at the present hour, with many cherished assumptions having been thoroughly upended.  None of this seems to matter.\n\nThe /r/Canada thread constitutes yet another barrage from this most pointless of batteries:\n\n&gt; If there had been no more war after that, then maybe all the remembrance, parades and accolades would mean something. All the death and destruction of WWI was for nothing, and therefore so was the sacrifice of all those people. I mourn all their loss, ruination and sacrifice but it wasn't worth it. It is never ever worth it. \n\nThat's from the opening comment, but there are plenty of others to echo the sentiment:\n\n&gt; What cause was there for anyone to fight for in the First World War?\n\n&gt; ---\n\n&gt; WW1 was a meaningless war and a terrible tragedy for all sides. There was no \"right\" or \"wrong\" side. It was just a big war between imperial powers that was fought with no regard for the lives of the young men that were used as cannon fodder on the front.\n\n&gt; ---\n\n&gt; WWI is an excellent example of a horrific, pointless war. WWII is an excellent example of a necessary war -- to stop a war of aggression by an evil dictator.\n\nWhat strikes me most about all of this is its casual surrender to ignorance.  The people who directed the war had very clear ideas about what it meant, what it ought to cost, how it was to be conducted, what strategic goals had to be achieved and what tactical means might best achieve them.  Sometimes those ideas proved inadequate to circumstance, but this is hardly a novelty in the history of combat and was not any more pronounced in the FWW than in any conflict before or since.  None of this is a mystery, though; you can go and quite easily read all of the various white papers and blue books and reports and declarations and speeches of those whose clashing spheres of power helped bring the war about.  It's all there, in black and white, much of it digitized and searchable and accessible for free by anyone.  So too is an endless array of opinion and hypothesis by those involved in the war; their thoughts and opinions can be known to us, their motives examined, their decisions explained.  You don't have to make bland assumptions or shrug despairingly when you can [just go read this](http://www.amazon.ca/Origins-First-World-War-Diplomatic/dp/0719074215/).\n\nAnd yet... so many people do anyway.  It's easier.  If the war still happened in spite of the intellectual efforts of some of the smartest people in the world in dozens of different countries, what chance does the typical Redditor have of understanding it all?  The volume I linked to above is not even comprehensive (though it is very, very good), but it's still the size of a phone book.  Who has that kind of time?  Who could be bothered to read all of these diplomatic cables and treaties and plans and memoranda when you can just shrug it all off as a conflict in which \"there was no 'right' or 'wrong' side\"; as \"just a big war between imperial powers that was fought with no regard for the lives of the young men that were used as cannon fodder on the front.\"  Nobody would even be mad if you did, because they're all doing it too.\n\nThe First World War **had actual causes**.  The First World War **bore actual results**.  Most of the First World War **happened on purpose for reasons that can be reflected upon and understood**.  The fact that it was intensely complicated and multi-faceted does not mean that we must simply give up, and it certainly does not give us the right to claim that nothing about it could possibly make sense.  It can; you just have to be prepared to do the work, and many people seem totally unwilling or unable to.  The war's leading scholars do not describe it in the trivial and reductive fashion of those in my quoted passages above; they know enough not to.  Who stands the better chance of being right about this?\n\nEvery conceivable strand of tired, reductive apologia is trotted out in that thread.  It's incredible to watch people progress indifferently through the whistle stops of \"Germany did nothing wrong,\" to \"even if they did everyone else was also wrong,\" to \"well even if Belgium suffered they deserved it somehow because Congo,\" to \"well even if that's a moot point war is still stupid so there,\" as though simply admitting to being wrong about something is worse than inventing a new reason to be upset on the spot.  Why must people be like this about such tremendously complicated and interesting subjects?  Why in the world are so many people actually satisfied with not knowing or thinking about a subject on which they nevertheless feel the need to broadcast strong opinions?  It's appalling.\n\nThe rest of that thread is a train wreck.  Everyone is accusing everyone else of glorifying war and not remembering things properly, or at least not ceremonializing that remembrance properly.  Heavily downvoted comments repudiate the very idea of commemoration, dismissing veterans as hired murderers who etc. \n\nFour more years, everyone.\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nMeanwhile, [one of the comments](http://np.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/2lyp9q/remember_who_they_still_are_in_spirit/clzw2kx) I didn't mention because oh my god:\n\n&gt; Yeah, what a great reason to send tens of thousands of Canadians to their deaths. I mean, heaven forbid our politicians, the people chosen among us to PREVENT THOSE FUCKING MASSACRES FROM HAPPENING IN THE FIRST PLACE ever lift a finger to actually do anything but rally popular war support.\n\n&gt; It's not like we could've paid attention to the rising tensions in Europe and actually sent help over while it was still relevant to calm everyone the fuck down. It's not like Canada is an amazing country to grow hemp which could then be burned on battlefields like incense, causing a sudden downward shift in aggressiveness for every soldier for miles around. \n\nI just... can't even...",

        "text": "When I noticed this [press release released for armistice day](http://stopwar.org.uk/news/ten-lies-we-re-told-to-justify-the-slaughter-of-20-million-in-the-first-world-war) floating onto [/r/unitedkingdom](http://np.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2lzmsr/ten_lies_were_told_to_justify_the_slaughter_of_20/) I knew that it would be good. They claim to want to reveal the truth about 10 widely held lies about WW1, but then have to make up some of the myths that it wants to bust in order to reach that magic click-bait number 'ten'. It is written from a staggeringly anglocentric viewpoint, and I shall reply in the same manner. So armed with just Wikipedia, Max Hastings, and a can of bully beef I have been sent out into the trenches against them, and here comes the first of these supposedly popular lies:\n\n&gt; 1 The war was fought in defence of democracy\n\nOh dear, this isn’t a good start. I have literally never heard anybody say that WW1 was fought in defence of democracy. The defence of Belgium comes up a lot, the defence of democracy … not really. So I’ll just skip over this straw man and go straight to the next point.\n\n&gt; 2 Britain went to war due to a treaty obligation to defend the neutrality of Belgium\n&gt; \n&gt; There was no clear and accepted obligation on Britain to do this, \n\nAnd here we learn that the [1839 treaty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_London_(1839) ) did not actually exist, which would have come as a bit of a surprise to the people that signed it. King Albert of Belgium certainly thought that it existed, and even called the British government asking for their help because of it.\n\n&gt; the war party in the cabinet was already pushing for British intervention on the entirely different ground that there were naval obligations to France. These obligations had been developed in secret arrangements between the military of both countries, and were never subject to any kind of democratic accountability.\n\nOoh, a secret conspiracy, who doesn’t love one of those? Perhaps we can get Dan Brown to write about it? However, back in reality whatever promises Grey and made were not worth the paper they were not written on without the support of parliament. Even as late as the morning of the 3rd of August, Sir John French was told by Asquith that there was no possibility of Britain sending an expeditionary force to France because he did not yet have the support of parliament.\n\n&gt; 3 German aggression was the driving force for war\n&gt;\n&gt; However aggressive the German leadership may have been in 1914,\n\n… with little things like pressing Austria-Hungary to go to war with Serbia, and then invading neutral Belgium …\n\n&gt; the British establishment was at least as determined to take the opportunity to go to war with its imperial rival.\n\nI’m guessing that for some reason they do not consider most of the Liberal Party to have been  to have been part of the establishment, what with being the ruling party. It is true that Grey, Haldane, Asquith and Churchill had wanted to get involved in the conflict, but the rest of the cabinet did not. However much he might have wanted it Asquith knew he could not have gone to war without the support of parliament, and it took the ultimatum from Germany to Belgium in order to get this.\n\n&gt; 4 Germany had started a naval arms race with Britain\n\nSeriously? Are they really going to say that the entire dreadnought race did not actually happen? Thankfully no, as after writing a bullshit title they back-pedal into saying: \n\n&gt; the logic of capitalist competition meant that Germany was bound to challenge British naval supremacy.\n\nBecause everybody knows how Dreadnoughts are really cheap and great at hauling cargo.\n\n&gt; 5 German imperialism was uniquely vicious and had to be challenged\n\nHere I guess they must be thinking of some other war since I have never seen this argument used about WW1, but it does make another good straw man.\n\n&gt; 6 Public opinion was united in favour of the war, as shown by images of cheering crowds in 1914\n\nAh! Finally, we see real myth has go for a burton. There was considerable anti-war sentiment, and it was not just at the grass roots but extending all the way up through the ruling party to those in the highest political offices.\n\n&gt; 7 The morale of British troops fighting on the Western Front remained intact to the end of the war\n\nA title that, again, required the author to immediately admit they were spouting bullshit. In the end all he actually managed to provide in order to bust this supposed lie was that amongst the soldiers there was:\n\n&gt; widespread cynicism about war strategies, contempt for the military leadership, and grave doubts about the purpose of the war\n\n… much like all soldiers everywhere throughout the whole of history.\n\n&gt; 8 The military leadership, notably General Haig, was not a bunch of incompetent ‘donkeys’\n\n[For this one I shall simply refer back to this previous post since it covers the reasons why Haig did what he did far better than I can](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2hietf/first_world_war_effortpost_why_did_they_bother/). He concludes with this about Haig and the Somme:\n\n&gt; The policy of offense had, in the end, worked. It put the Germans who in 1914 and 1915 and even 1916 were in position to seize initiative and crush the French and British on the perpetual backfoot and allowed the Entente, with all their manpower and their blockades, to squeeze the Germans dry.\n\nIf anybody has not read that post by /u/elos_ you really should because it is great; but back to the supposed myths as now we reach number 9.\n\n&gt; 9 The end of the war saw the triumph of liberal capitalism, against collapsing autocratic Empires\n\nBy the end of the war nobody was in a good state. Just as Jan Gotlib Bloch had predicted back in 1899, the war that only ended with the total collapse of a number of the belligerents. The big ones now flat on their back are the Russia Empire, the German Empire, Austria-Hungary Empire and the Ottoman Empire; all of which were, to varying degrees, autocratic. The big ones that have not collapsed are Britain, France, Italy, and the USA. Notice any pattern here? Yep, the ones still standing are all capitalist and, to varying degrees, liberal.\n\n&gt; 10 Despite the slaughter and destruction, the war was worthwhile\n\nSo finally they end with a moral judgement about what is ’worthwhile’. This is a question that is [impossible to answer with historical facts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is–ought_problem), which is good since the rest of the article contained so few of them. Stalemate.\n\nThis final record of this articles actions are: 2 straw men bayonetted in training, 1 stalemate in the trenches, 2 tactical withdrawals, 4 defeats and just 1 lie gloriously conquered. With a record like that they could even make the Austro-Hungarians look good.",

I have highlighted \"nationalism\" in the source because the OP states that nationalism is \"not a necessary facet\" in fascism. Here's a basic ideology quote:\n\n\"Communism stands for a stateless society where all are equal. No one is rich or poor in a communist system. In Communism, it is the community that holds the production and the major resources. On the other hand, Fascism pertains to state and it considers state on top of everything. In fascism the state is all embracing. For the fascists, no human values exist outside the state. Fascism believes that everything is within the State and nothing is above the State or outside the State or against the State. Fascism believes in **nationalism** (includes economic nationalism), corporatism (includes economic planning), militarism and totalitarianism (dictatorship and social interventionism).\n\nThe Communists think globally where as the Fascists think only in a **national level**.\"\n\nhttp://www.differencebetween.net/miscellaneous/difference-between-communism-and-fascism/#ixzz3IhNZMWU8\n\n**Quote from another /r/badhistory post:**\n\n\"Rule 5:\nIf this were true the German Democratic Republic would be a democratic state. Hitler was a known enemy of the communists and vice versa. Fascism and communism are ideological opposites. The mere nationalization of certain industries does not necessarily entail socialism or communism. The idea that Nazi Germany hated communists solely because of their war with the USSR is laughable; the opposition of Fascism and communism long predates the rise of the USSR. One of Fascism's main causes for existence was its opposition to communism.\"\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2fjkqn/nazi_party_was_socialist_because_its_in_their_name/",

        "text": "Episode N+1 of [Things on CaeciliusInHorto's Newsfeed](http://eu.greekreporter.com/2014/11/06/archaeologists-claim-they-have-found-the-trojan-horse-in-turkey/).\n\nEssentially, apparently archaeologists have discovered something which may or may not have been the Trojan Horse in excavations near Troy/Hirsarlik. Sounds too good to be true, right?\n\n&gt; The structure found fits the description by Homer, Virgil, Augustus and Quintus Smyrnaeus. So, archaeologists tend to believe that the finding is indeed the remains of the subterfuge Greeks used to conquer ancient Troy.\n\nThis is interesting. Clearly the person who wrote this has never read Homer. If they had, they'd know that the best description we get in Homer of the Trojan Horse is this, from Odyssey VIII:\n\n&gt; the horse of wood\n\nWell, I feel very confident I could identify something with a description as thorough as that. Don't you?\n\nWell, we have Virgil too:\n\n&gt; build a horse of mountainous size, through Pallas's divine art,\n\n&gt; and weave planks of fir over its ribs:\n\n&gt; they pretend it's a votive offering: this rumour spreads.\n\n&gt; They secretly hide a picked body of men, chosen by lot,\n\n&gt; there, in the dark body, filling the belly and the huge\n\n&gt; cavernous insides with armed warriors\n\nStill not exactly a brilliant description. Though we now know that this horse is big enough to fit \"a picked body of men\" inside. Now, I don't know how many men that would have to be, but this is going to be a pretty fucking big horse. It doesn't strike me as something likely to be reality, rather than myth. But I digress.\n\nAnyone familiar with the excavation of Troy might have more doubts on this, by now. Schliemann excavated in the 1870s what is now known as Troy II, on the grounds that that was the Troy of the Trojan war. Sadly, it was later dated to the mid 2000s BCE. Mycenae did not become a power until the mid 1000s BCE. If anything of Homer is accurate, it cannot be referring to Troy II. \n\nWhat is doubly sad is that in order to get to Troy II, Schliemann essentially destroyed large parts of the 11 layers above it. Whoops. What this means is that masses of archaeological evidence, including that in Troy VII, the Troy, if there was one, of the Trojan War, was damaged or destroyed. \n\nThe other thing about Troy is that Troy VIIa has only been excavated in very small parts. The chances of finding the most distinctive marker that it is the Troy of the Trojan war, especially considering that most historians have considered that there probably wasn't a Trojan horse in the first place is something between slim and nil.\n\nSo, we are dubious of this story. But, it could be argued, it might all be true. There's nothing obviously *wrong* here, just a lot which is suspicious. They mention Eratosthenes' dating of the Trojan war, which scholars agree is probably in the right ballpark. They don't mention which layer the \"horse\" was found in, but this is an article for laypeople.\n\nWhy, thank you, imaginary interlocutor.\n\nAs /u/Daeres wrote in his [excellent post on April Fools badhistory](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/221rtg/the_deconstruction_of_falling_stars_taking_apart/), when you are suspicious of something:\n\n&gt; the trick is to apply the same methodology for this scenario as I recommended in the two others- follow up on the sources.\n\nI googled the two archaeologists cited. Neither of them appear to exist. I looked for evidence that Boston university was recently doing a dig in Hirsalik. No evidence of that, either.

Everything started a long time ago in a magical place called /r/worldnews when an overflying bird called *The Independent* [dropped a turd,](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/jesus-married-mary-magdalene-and-had-children-according-to-ancient-manuscript-9849839.html) and all the denizens of /r/worldnews came out to proclaim this miraculous new thing. Soon cries of 'Checkmate religion!' sprang up as everyone ran to affirm how sketchy Jesus's 'existence' is how it was so not contemporary and probably not real. \n\n\n\n&gt; [Keep appealing to consensus, it's only a logical fallacy, while we are at it let's conclude that the Abrahamic God exists because that's the worlds consensus. Keep avoiding having to bring up the actual evidence because you know it's nothing but grasping at straws.](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2ls98u/jesus_married_mary_magdalene_and_had_children/cly6914)\n\n\n\nSo apparently because I pointed out that [the majority of scholars on the subject agree that Josephus's references to Jesus are genuine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus_on_Jesus) I'm committing a 'logical fallacy' and 'appealing to consensus.' Shame on me. Better go have a shot. \n\n\n\n\n&gt; [Yeah, the Tacitus reference is pretty solid, though of course he was likely hearing a story of a story of the events, which is obviously unreliable.](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2ls98u/jesus_married_mary_magdalene_and_had_children/cly2f92)\n\n\n\nAh yes. If you don't like what the man has to say, accuse him of hearsay and be glad he's 2000 years in the grave. Just because he's considered to have been a very professional and accurate ancient historian who swore against hearsay in *Annals* doesn't mean he didn't use hearsay in *Annals* when talking about this one subject. \n\n\n &gt;*\"My object in mentioning and refuting this story is, by a conspicuous example, to put down hearsay, and to request that all those into whose hands my work shall come not to catch eagerly at wild and improbable rumours in preference to genuine history.\"*\n\n\n   - (Tacitus, *Annals*, IV.11)\n\n\n\nBut no, I'm sure he just wrote down hearsay from the Christians -whom he hated with a passion. \n\n\n\n\n&gt; [Maybe because I replied to someone who said that Jesus was indeed a real person when they have no evidence to back that statement up. If someone said that King Arthur was real I would have said the same thing. Why wouldn't I single on Jesus in a thread about Jesus?](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2ls98u/jesus_married_mary_magdalene_and_had_children/cly8501)\n\n\n\n\nFuck it all, [here's](http://armariummagnus.blogspot.ca/2014/01/did-jesus-exist-jesus-myth-theory-again.html) the customary /u/timoneill tribute. I'm going to go hit my head against a wall for a few hours. \n",

        "text": "I like infomercials. I think they're hilarious, and while I can imagine the target audience for some of them (well, mostly), I know I am not that target audience, despite the infomercial's desperate attempts to pretend I am. When I stumbled across [this infomercial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZeJZs2fdYo), though, I was horrified - yes, *horrified* - to find that it was basing itself on a lie. \n\nThe infomercial is for a product called the Comfort Wipe, which is basically toilet paper on a stick. It bills itself as \"the first improvement to toilet paper as we know it since the 1880s.\" While the idea of using a stick is an ancient one - the Romans, for instance, would use a sponge on a stick as an...shall we say \"anal cleansing device?\" - and while I can't necessarily comment on whether the Comfort Wipe ought to qualify as an improvement on the concept of toilet paper, there are improvements that have been made to toilet paper since the 1880s other than putting it on a stick.\n\nToilet paper as a commercial product was first invented by [Joseph Gayetty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Gayetty) in 1857, though the idea of wiping one's bum with paper is substantially older than that. Chinese emperors, for instance, had it in the 14th century, specially ordering it in 2x3 foot sheets. Even before Gayetty, using inked paper such as used catalogues or almanacs was a popular solution. Gayetty's innovation was to add aloe to the sheets to soften and lubricate them a bit. While he was derided as a quack by some, the idea caught on and became popular. \n\nIn 1879, Scott Paper Company was founded. It sold, among other things, toilet paper in a long, unperforated roll. However, it's not entirely clear whether it was their invention or the invention of the Albany Perforated Wrapping Paper Company in 1877. The two appeared at roughly the same time, and due to the sensitive nature of the product, beat around the bush in terms of marketing it. Either way, toilet paper on a roll definitely existed by the 1880s and became more and more popular. \n\nWas it what we'd recognise as toilet paper, though? Well, as I said, it was unperforated, meaning it was harder to tear. The first perforated rolls were being sold by the Albany company by 1885, however, so this is likely what the Comfort Wipe ad is referring to. I completely agree with them that perforated toilet paper is a huge improvement. Is it the only improvement since Scott and Albany introduced toilet paper on a roll, though? Hardly. 1935 saw the introduction of the \"splinter-free\" toilet paper by Northern Tissue, implying rather unfortunate things about the toilet paper that had come before. Personally, I see a splinter-less bum as an improvement on the alternative, but this is toilet paper on a stick, so the ad and I might have a difference of opinion.\n\nWhat cannot be denied, though, is the most mighty innovation of all. In 1943, St. Andrew's Paper Mill introduced two-ply toilet paper. The importance of this development in toilet paper cannot be denied. Having gone through American public schools and having suffered through single ply toilet paper, the miracle that is two-ply (or even *three-ply*, if you're particularly luxurious) should not and must not be understated. No longer did toilet paper users have to suffer through unfortunate dissolvings partway through. No longer did one have to grab twice as much toilet paper as necessary just to be on the safe side. With two-ply toilet paper, one could feel safe, secure, and comfy. Comfort Wipe is a foolish, foolish product for denying the majesty that is the invention of two-ply toilet paper.\n\nThere have, of course, been innovations in toilet paper since then. [This](http://www.boots.com/en/Andrex-Washlets-Toilet-Tissue-Wipes_6531/), for instance, is a moist toilet paper, designed to help with incontinence as well as to provide extra cleanliness. There is also the aforementioned triple-ply and an improvement on toilet paper design and environmental-friendliness. The ultimate point, though, is that far from being a stagnant product as claimed by this infomercial, toilet paper has gone through steady improvements and is likely to continue improving as our understanding of it increases. Let us never deny the steady forward march of toilet paper technology.",

        "text": "[Courtesy of William \"Willie\" Frazer](http://i.imgur.com/a1a2hw7.png), a man who has, among other things, embezzled money from charities, initiated a bullying campaign to fire a young Catholic teacher, faked death threats against himself, and accused a school flying an Italian flag of being an IRA training camp.\n\nI realize that the latter part of this might skirt a bit close to Rule 2, so just let me know if anything needs to be removed.\n\nNicholas Canny's *Making Ireland British* is a pretty good book if you want to learn more about the topic. \n\n&gt;Remembering the Protestants of 1641 at the River Bann in Portadown yesterday.\n\nSo far so good.\n\n&gt;The assacre of 1641, \n\nHmm.\n\n&gt;one of the foulest deeds ever perpetrated in all the dark and bloodthirsty history of Ireland, started on 23rd October 1641. \n\nAssuming this is talking about the Portadown Massacre (in which case the date is wrong), I don’t know about “one of the foulest deeds”. It’s morally reprehensible, yes, but 100 people died. 10,000 people died in the Battle of Clontarf 600 years earlier, and 3,500 people would die when Cromwell massacred the population of Wexford in 1649, just for two bloodier examples. Heck, some people think that the Portadown Massacre itself was a reprisal for the slaughter of 600 or so Scottish Royalist prisoners in County Down the previous year.\n\n&gt;On that terrible October Saturday the native Irish Papists, led by Sir Phelim O'Neill, and incited, encouraged, financed, aided and abetted by the Roman Catholic Church, its priests and hierarchy, rose up in an insurrection,\n\nWait, not the Portadown Massacre after all I suppose, he must be talking about the Confederate Wars.\n\nThere was a lot of religious disquiet among the Irish people and this was exploited by some ideologues among the Nobility when they were trying to drum up support for the rebellion, but the Catholic Church as an institution wasn’t so heavily involved. Innocent X sent a Nuncio with arms and ammunition at a much later stage, after it looked like the Confederates had gained the upper hand. Priests and Bishops supported the rebellion, but considering the Confederates were the only side that weren’t rounding them up and executing them I don’t think they can be blamed. \n\nBesides, it wasn’t some spontaneous case of “Alright bais, let’s forsake our livelihoods and positions and instigate a rebellion against the British, it’ll be some craic”. It started with independent Lords trying to reclaim land that had been taken from them in the Plantations. The vast majority of the native Irish nobility were willing to try and help contain the violence with their own men, but when the government indicated that they were going to strip *all* Catholics of their lands and titles for the actions of a few, resentment started to grow.\n\n&gt;the sole purpose of which was the total eradication of Protestants and Protestantism throughout the Emerald Isle.\n\nIf that was a purpose at all it certainly wasn’t the sole one. The rebels wanted to be able to freely practice their religion and be treated as equal subjects under the rule of King Charles, which hardly sounds unreasonable. It’s hard to construe it as a purely religious conflict, considering the Confederates struck up alliances with the Protestant factions more than once. Protestantism hadn’t manifested in Ireland at all prior to the Plantations, so yes, I suppose they wanted to get all Protestants out of Ireland in the sense that all Protestants in Ireland at the time happened to be British colonists sent there to try and outbreed and anglicise the Irish. \n\n&gt;All that had been accomplished in the preceding three decades, since the Plantation of Ulster, spiritually, politically and economically was to be wiped out by fire and the sword.\n\nThere’s a kernel of truth to everything that’s been said so far but this is absolute malarkey. I can’t for the life of me understand how what was essentially a land grab was spiritually beneficial to anyone involved. Catholics were massively disenfranchised, if you want to count that as a political victory then go ahead. Economically the development of towns helped provide the planter communities with markets, which benefited precisely themselves and their estates back in England.\n\n&gt;Three and a half centuries later and in our third decade of the war of genocide currently being waged by the Roman Catholic terrorists of the IRA and their offshoots, \n\nI can’t touch this because of certain rules imposed on this sub by certain authoritarian figures, but I will say that the word genocide is thrown about a lot these days. In this particular instance it happens to be bullspit. \n\n&gt;little has changed, with the exception of the weaponry. Swords, pikes and daggers have been replaced by bombs and bullets supplied by Libya and the nations of the Communist world.\n\nThe only communist country I can think of that supplied the IRA with anything at all was Czechoslovakia. It was just an arms company in that case as well, it can't be compared to the case with Libya, where the government itself was giving them weapons and supplies. \n\n&gt;The sad fact is that today the events of 1641 are very largely forgotten they have become censored history.\n\nWhich is why for this writeup I was able to consult 4 articles and a book available freely online by googling “Portadown Massacre”.\n\n&gt;Our people are unlikely to hear the facts from the Church pulpits where ecumenical and apostate clergy continually tell their flocks that we must forget our unhappy divisions. \n\nI don’t know why clergy would be talking about a 17th century political event but okay.\n\n&gt;Our children will definitely not hear of this major event which influenced all Ulster history thereafter, for in the schools today every effort is being made to emphasise our supposedly shared culture and heritage, \n\nInterestingly enough I first learned about the Portadown Massacre in school. \n\n&gt;thereby accelerating the process of de-Protestantization in preparation for the final push towards a united Roman Catholic dominated Irish Republic.\n\ntop kek\n",

        "text": "http://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/2ln031/neoconfederate_who_says_civil_rights_are/clwe8xi\n\n&gt;The cause of the war was multi-faceted and depends entirely upon the side you're speaking of at any given moment. Slavery was a component of states' rights which was part of a much larger economic conflict with the north. Slavery was the most important of those issues and the reason for secession. However, the Union did not go to war over slavery -- the Union went to war to preserve the Union\n\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg. He goes through an entire routine of mental gymnastics that would make even the most ardent aerialist blush. He then ramps it up with this:\n\n&gt;Slavery would have died out peacefully in the Confederacy as it did everywhere else in the world. Despite the fact that people continue to vilify the South today, slavery existed all over the world by untold number of civilizations and people including African blacks themselves. It even existed under the United States flag for 75 years, but only 4 years under the flag(s) of the Confederacy.\n\nand this:\n\n&gt;The South did not start the war. Constitutionally, the South was well within their legal right to secede (even though I do believe the hot heads forced the issue sooner than they should have). Nobody has ever suggested the Confederacy had any intention of invading or attempting to \"overthrow\" the government of the United States -- they did exactly what their Revolutionary forefathers did. They dissolved existing political ties (they voluntarily entered into in the first place) to form a new government of their own choosing with the consent of the governed. Regardless of whether the justification of their cause was moral/immoral -- they had the legal and fundamentally American right to leave.\n\nOh, and the abolitionists were all racists:\n\n&gt;Along those lines, it's easy to forget that everyone in America was racist by today's standards which includes abolitionists who often spoke in terms and phrases that would be condescending at best and outright racist when viewed through the lens of contemporary sensibilities. The Union may have moved toward the abolition of slavery faster than the south, but their conduct after the war should make it plainly obvious that they did NOT former slaves flooding their cities and taking industrial jobs away from white workers...especially returning veterans. Again, the Union went to war to preserve the existing Union.\n\nLots more to be had in the thread.\n\nHere is just a starting point as to why that is bullshit:\n\n&gt;Unfortunately for those who want to rewrite history, America was pretty good at record keeping, and this holds true even in the South during their \"we wanna be our own country\" phase. Revisionists and those they have tricked into believing untruths can argue all they want, but the states that seceded from the Union were very clear on why they did so. This might make that whole yearly Confederate History Month seem a bit more racist. (a BIT? - ed)\n\n&gt;In reality, there were four states in the Confederacy who decided to write their own declarations of why they were seceding from the Union. Surely the racists of today would go back in time and tell them not to do this. After all, why leave a paper trail of racism? Oh well, too bad. Here you go!\n\n&gt;South Carolina Was Very Clear On The Matter.\n\n&gt;South Carolina pretty much destroyed the idea that the Civil War was over states' rights in its declaration. The state said that several northern states \"have enacted laws which either nullify the Acts of Congress or render useless any attempt to execute them.\" They were very upset about this because these states' laws often allowed slaves to stay as freemen if within their territories. Okay, so the Civil War was about states' rights, unless that state didn't agree with the institution of slavery? Right.\n\n&gt;On top of this, the declaration seems to get pretty mad over the fact that the North labeled slavery as \"sinful,\" and they even went on to say that the North had \"encouraged and assisted thousands of our slaves to leave their homes; and those who remain, have been incited by emissaries, books and pictures to servile insurrection.\" That's right! No teaching Africans to read or look at pictures! Because they might want freedom then.\n\n&gt;Mississippi Was Proud Of The War Being Over Slavery.\n\n&gt;But oh, Mississippi. They're a little bit off hinge nowadays, but back in the day, they were straight forward with their beliefs. Their declaration literally says that they're leaving the Union because their \"position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery- the greatest material interest of the world. Its labor supplies the product which constitutes by far the largest and most important portions of commerce of the earth.\"\n\n&gt;It's a bit long to post the whole declaration here, but seriously, go read it. They literally say that slaves are necessary because only Africans can handle the type of heat experienced through work in the South.\n\n&gt;Georgia Upset That Its Slaves Could Run North To Freedom.\n\n&gt;Ah, and the good old Peach State: Georgia. They wrote a lengthy declaration and actually cited numerous sources (something unheard of in the conservative party of today), but it all broke down to \"leave our slaves alone!\" One reason Georgia left is because a provision in \"the Constitution [that] requires them [Northern states] to surrender fugitives from labor.\"\n\n&gt;Georgia, not one to not go all out, also said \"Our confederates, with punic faith, shield and give sanctuary to all criminals [runaway slaves] who seek to deprive us of this property or who use it to destroy us.\" That's right: runaway slaves were criminals and Georgia was mad that the North wasn't returning them. In fact, go ahead and read Georgia's declaration as well. It's a bit longer, but there's literally not three sentences that go by without mentioning slavery as a cause for secession.\n\nThis goes on for a pretty long spell, and is actually a very interesting read.\n\nSource: \n\nhttp://portside.org/2013-11-04/absolute-proof-civil-war-was-about-slavery\n\nAgain, there's quite a bit to wade through, but this is yet another alarmingly typical revisionist way for some people to absolve themselves from the sins of their forebears. Others just like demonizing the \"North\" because they glean some twisted kind of patriotism from it...",

The first hard contact with Japanese fleet did come from a patrolling Catalina, and after that, B-17s and Catalina seaplanes attacked the invasion force. A second detection on June 4th occurred, via Catalina. Later on, Radar and Radio stations did a lot of detection. (Fun fact: Apparently, one could determine the identity of someone sending a radio message by their patterns of writing.

First off, wrong use of tactics. Secondly, the purpose of the Japanese attack was put them a step closer to invading or occupying the Hawaiian Islands. That objective was strategic, not tactical, and since strategy is kind of the opposite of tactics, I'll call this line the opposite of right.\n\nAs for the second part, it too was amazingly wrong.

Much of the actual scrambling came from the Japanese forces, who had to simultaneously land their fuel-exhausted forces from the previous day and launch a new wave. Aircraft were launched later that day from the US side, going away from the setting sun.\n\n&gt;This is the crucial moment in the heat of the war\n\n&gt;To fly and hit our targets\n\n&gt;Down in the waves\n\nIt *was* widely considered the most crucial battle of the Pacific Front. If the Japanese had established forces in striking positions of Oahu, they could have crippled the US's ability to move forces in the Pacific, as was their goal.\n\nThe second two lines are okay, unless you consider the actual dogfighting that took place.\n\n&gt;Midway\n\n&gt;Display their might, ordering carriers, admirals at war\n\n&gt;We'll meet at Midway\n\n&gt;To win the fight tactics are crucial, naval war\n\nThough it may seem like Sabaton is covering its collective ass by describing both the involved Admirals and the tactics, they only managed to be triply wrong. The US high command, called CinCPac, lost connection to their forces, relying for some time on intercepted Japanese radio messages to follow the action, while at the same time, the US's biggest advantage was the strategic concentration of their forces and defenders advantage. Again, use of tactics is wrong.\n\nLastly, US Army B-17s played an important and at time decisive role at Midway.\n\n&gt;Far from shore a pacific war\n\n&gt;Bombs are falling from the skies\n\n&gt;Its a bomb run day, it's the naval way\n\n&gt;A bloodred sun is on the rise\n\nFirst off, shore batteries from Midway actually fired upon some Japanese ships. Second line is correct - bombs are used. Third line is kind of wrong. Bomb run days were not the Naval way until, well, Midway and Pearl Harbor, as carriers were not in wide use until then, unless one refers to *HMS Victory*, Horatio Nelson's advanced fleet supercarrier. [citation needed]\n\nThirdly, this was an incredible defeat for Japan - Wikipedia says:\n\n    US Losses\n\n    1 carrier sunk\n\n    1 destroyer sunk\n\n    ~150 aircraft destroyed\n\n     307 killed\n\n    Japanese Losses\n\n    4 carriers sunk\n\n    1 heavy cruiser sunk\n\n    1 heavy cruiser damaged\n\n    248 aircraft destroyed\n\n    3,057 killed\n\nSo, in no sense could this have been a battle that raised the Bloodred sun that represents Japan, and as stated earlier, almost none of the battle took place around sunrise.\n\n&gt;Chorus\n\n\n----\n\nSource\n\n*Nimitz* by Elmer Belmont Potter.

        "text": "http://np.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/2l9kzt/the_german_wehrmacht_waffen_ss_in_the_east/\n\nSo this is a thread. It is *ost*ensibly about footage of the eastern front, but it is actually CHOCK\n\nFULL\n\nOF\n\nNAZIS\n\nLet's begin. The comments start off with allview74's wonderful note\n\n&gt;Man, the Nazi's may have done a lot of really horrible things, but I have a tremendous amount of respect for what the average German soldier had to go through fighting on the Eastern front. The scale and savagery of that fighting is truly incomprehensible to anyone who wasn't there. Like trying to imagine outer space. Its just too vast to truly understand\n\nHere's the thing. This might be contreversial, but when you use the phrase \"The nazis may have done a bunch of really horrible things, but...\" you're probably not going anywhere smart, sane, or polite. Moving on,\n\nThere's a bunch of people being all like \"I had relatives in the east, they said the russians were barbarians\" and stuff.\n\nSomeone recommends \"Forsaken Army\" by Heinrich Gerlach, a novel written by a veteran of the fighting at stalingrad, of which Kirkus^1 said:\n\n&gt;More interesting than many German novels of its kind, this-although nominally fiction- is not really a true novel since every incident and character is real and the true purpose of the book is propaganda. Another piece to fill in the jigsaw puzzle that was the German mentality in the thirties and forties, this is a sober book lacking the ferocious blood and iron scenes that embellish Willi Heinrich's novels of the German army.\n\nSo far, though, not much actual *history* that has been wrong, mostly idiots jerking over nazis. Then we get this, from OP no less.\n\n&gt;it´s an interesting fact that 21 allied soldiers died before a german soldier was killed, the allied mainly won the war because of the hughe human resources they had.\n\nIt's interesting to note here that 1. OP says they're german, and 2. that's bullshit. \n\nLet's look at this claim. First, OP says that 21 allied soldiers died before a german was killed. So, then, I would presume, the Wermacht would have, having taken ~3.975 million casualties according to Frumkin,^2 inflicted around 83,475,000 casualties on the allies. You might recognize this as roughly the high estimate for total war deaths, including civilians, and war related famine. The real casualty rate was somewhere around 2:1. I'm sure someone with better statistics than I could maybe break it down by front, by ally, etc. (hint hint)\n\nHerr Cobue also says that the allies won the war because of their \"hughe human resources\" While this is not false, it's not true either. The allies won because they had better men, better materiel, food, more people, weren't being bombed to shit constantly by the 8th Airforce, RAF Bomber Command, and the VVS. There's a myriad of reasons the Nazis lost, but frankly, 'bekaz DAE hoomin wav' isn't one of them.\n\nAnyway, \n\n&gt;I read the book on the western front from 44 on, it was 13 allied soldiers against one german. My Grandfater was lieutenant-colonel of the panzers, mainly at the eastern front and he told me lot about those days. It was a war nobody can imagine today how tough it was. And in my opinion all the people condemning this brave men because they fought on the wrong side, the side that lost the war, are barbarians. They don´t just told them that their bravery was in vain, but they are constantly telling that it was criminal. It was hearthbreaking to see my grandfather struggling with this.\n\nBlah blah blah, yes OP, we get you have a hard on for the nazis and your grandfather was literally rommel. whoopity doo! (honestly I love butthurt nazis)\n\nBUT WAIT! THERE'S MORE! THE SHITHORN BLOWS FORTH ONCE MORE!\n\n&gt;And what did the so peaceful soveits did after they won the war? They bulit a iron curtain and massacred people in praha, berlin and budapest. Come on you are believing your own propaganda lies.\n\nWell. I guess the Prague spring, 1956 Hungarian revolution, and some imaginary massicre in Berlin completely justify calling the Nazis good! Silly me, thinking that Das Aryanischer Ubermenschen could do wrong in exterminating die russische und die Juden Untermenschen. Danke Herr Himmler, für meinen toten Familie. \n\nLet's move on. We now have Mr. Hilter saying that \n\n&gt;Galland was personal friend of my grandfather\n\nAnd while I don't doubt the possibility of Herr cobue's grandfather being freinds with Adolf Galland, I sincerely doubt that a east-front tanker would be around a west-front pilot.\n\n&gt;There's at least one army completely missing from this documentary. I wonder why there's no mention of the Soviet NKVD Army, which was at least as strong as the regular Soviet Army. Oh well, they don't say much about the non-aggression pact Stalin &amp; Hitler signed and enjoyed for 2 years before WW2 began.\n\nI don't think this person understands the NKVD. They had 5 divisions. The normal soviet army had somewhere around 300 divisions including combat support arms. \n\n&gt;The broad mass of German soldiers did their duty, that's it. Most weren't even Nazis.\n&gt;Show some respect for the soldiers who fought in the biggest and probably most gruesome war ever, for they were just puppets of their government.\n\nSure, I bet you want me to respect the Serbian troops in the Bosnian war, because just becuase they slaughtered neraly 9000 people in Srebrenica, You do not earn respect, especially mine, by slaughtering innocents.\n\nAt the end we have a pole say this.\n\n&gt;A a Polish guy I truly hope none of men seen in the vid made it home.\n\nThis is a bit harsh, but completely understandable. The Nazis, as our very own /u/tobbinator pointed out, wanted to basically slaughter or exterminate the slavs. OP, being a hitlerite shithorn, descides that the 'bloody sunday' massacre of roughly 1-300 ethnic germans is the reason for the German invasion that took place two days earlier. Among other highlights of this chain is these gems from /u/myself2\n\n&gt;Uh, cause they kicked your ass?\n\nand\n\n&gt;wars have been happening since the Man have walked the earth, don't take it so personally.\n\n&gt;Also germans considered themselves superior to the polish, but they didn't try to erase you though, might have treated many of you inhumanely, but talking about an extermination is borderline pathetic.\n\nMad props, however, go to /u/alakul who made [this wonderful list of OP's comments](http://np.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/2l9kzt/the_german_wehrmacht_waffen_ss_in_the_east/cltouk3)\n\n***For some levity after that bullshit have [this video.

        "text": "I'm not a historian. I'm a teenager with a smattering of academic journals (and occasionally Wikipedia, for which I apologize in advance) and a subscription to /r/badhistory. But by God, I know lunacy when I see it, and [this article is asylum-level](http://www.americanheritage.com/content/what-we-lost-great-war?page=show).  \n\nAs far as I know, *American Heritage* is generally a pretty worthwhile magazine, but taking in a finance writer to write an article may not have been their best idea. Let's start from the top. **If I have made an error in any way, please let me know so it can be fixed and I can still claim to maintain moral superiority over this article. Thanks much.**\n\nThe introductory paragraphs are sort of rambly, but as far as I can tell there's nothing historically wrong with them. I mean, they're self-contradictory:\n&gt;It was constant, incremental change that brought about these differences  \n\nbut then\n&gt;Edith Wharton’s world suffered just such a calamity [to provoke a sudden change]  \n\nOn the whole, however, it's mostly alright, right up until we get to\n&gt;Because of the war, the word Victorian became a term of opprobrium that extended far beyond the ebb and flow of fashion.  \n\nI can't speak for the word itself — Merriam-Webster tells me it was first used two years into Victoria's reign, but I can't find the contexts in which it was actually used. However, going for the spirit of the sentence instead of the letter, Victorian morality was mocked before even Edward was anywhere near the throne — just look at, say, *[The Importance of Being Earnest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Importance_of_Being_Earnest)*, whose \"major themes are the triviality with which it treats institutions as serious as marriage, and the resulting satire of Victorian ways.\" Which sounds pretty darn contemptuous to me.  \nNow, this may seem like a minor point, and it is somewhat, but seeing as the author reiterates and emphasizes the point that the First World War abruptly shifted moral and cultural values, having this fact be... well, wrong... is fairly noteworthy.\n&gt;Their civilization had, after all, entirely remade the world in the preceding two hundred years.\nConsider the facts:\n\nHERE WE GO\n&gt;But by the year 1700 Europe had already invented a cultural tool of transcendent power called the scientific method. In the eighteenth century this tool was applied to an ever-widening area of inquiry with beneficial results in fields as diverse as agriculture, cloth manufacture, and metalworking. By the close of that century, Europe was clearly the dominant power center of the world and was projecting that power commercially, militarily, and politically over a wider and wider area.\n\nOh, Christ. [Let's take a look at the Edwin Smith Papyrus.](http://archive.nlm.nih.gov/proj/ttp/flash/smith/smith.html) (Seriously, you can turn the pages and everything, it's so cool; make sure to click \"Text\" if you are a Philistine who can't read hieroglyphs)  \nThe Edwin Smith Papyrus details procedures for surgeons in ancient Egypt. It advises the doctor to follow a four-step process: examination, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. HM. THAT SOUNDS REMARKABLY LIKE A SCIENTIFIC METHOD. And what do you know! It's from 1500 BCE! And Africa, too! Golly gee, it's almost like people knew how to use science before the bloody seventeenth century! (Let's not forget that Aristotle's entire philosophy is based around a scientific method [citation: literally every piece of literature on Aristotle], though of course he was actually from Europe, which renders this article's author almost a little bit correct, nearly.)\n\nAnd, of course, it is the power of science that brings dominance to Europe as the rest of the world falls to its knees in awe of le enlightened European culture. Or that might just be the Eurocentric idiots. \n&gt;A hundred years later still, at the end of the nineteenth century, any comparison between the West and other cultures bordered on the meaningless, so great had the gap in power and wealth grown. \n\nI've always been unclear as to the exact boundary between \"the West\" and \"the East\" (though I think the Ottoman Empire was the basic demarcation?), but I'm fairly sure Russia was both \"not the West\" and \"sort of had an empire to its name\" (though, depending on which point \"the end of the nineteenth century\" is referring could, is potentially rather unstable; yet, I'd be willing to call it powerful enough to qualify as rivaling the ALMIGHTY WEST).\n\n&gt;To better understand the predominant attitudes of he West before the First World War, consider what it accomplished in the nineteenth century as a result of the Industrial Revolution. Quite simply, the quality of life was miraculously transformed. Indoor plumbing, central heating, brilliant interior lighting, abundant clothing, and myriad inexpensive industrial products from wallpaper to iceboxes gave the middle and upper classes a standard of living undreamed of a century earlier by even the richest members of society.\n\nGuys. It's okay. The British Industrial Revolution was great for everyone because it gave us interior lighting. Come to think of it, it's probably the same lighting that lit up the Dark Ages and allowed the scientific method to be created. Wondrous Europe.\nBut, ah, the author predicts every single reader calling foul! Take a look!\n\n&gt;The nineteenth century is usually perceived as one in which great industrial and commercial fortunes were created in the midst—even because of—the grinding poverty of the masses. This is largely a misperception. To be sure, the absolute number of people living in poverty in the Western world greatly increased in the nineteenth century, but only because the population as a whole greatly increased. Moreover, the movement of workers from agriculture to industry concentrated the poor in highly visible urban areas. But their forebears had been no less poor... Meanwhile, the percentage of the population living in poverty declined.\n\n&gt;In 1800 perhaps 85 percent of the population of Britain—then the richest and most advanced of Western nations—lived in or very near poverty, where 85 percent of the human population had always lived. These people had to work as hard as they could just to get enough to eat and obtain shelter and clothes...  \n\n&gt;But by 1900 less than 30 percent of the British population was still at that economic level...\n\nSee! He made up two statistics, and the first imaginary statistic is worse than the second imaginary statistic, so the 1900s are better! It's so audacious that it might just work. Other estimates [apparently place the percentage of impoverished people in nineteenth-century Britain as between 33% and 50%](https://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/journal_of_interdisciplinary_history/v033/33.4ziliak.html). So, not quite 85%. And, since he's trying to argue for the Industrial Revolution's perfect superiority, let's not forget the [uptick in mortality and child labor it brought](http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=cf34a6c2-c6b0-41ea-bf69-f203db1b9b5a%40sessionmgr113&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=124). Which, you know. Is rather notable.\n\n&gt;Democracy, beginning to develop only in the new United States in 1800, was by 1900 the birthright of millions in both the old and new worlds.\n\nLiterally only the United States had ever tried democracy. What would we do without America? Plus, the view of democracy as pure and uncorrupt, but let's not have the political arguments.\n\n&gt;In two hundred years Western civilization had made itself rich and powerful and learned while the rest of mankind remained poor, and therefore weak and ignorant. \n\nConveniently ignoring, of course, the fact that most other countries were only \"poor, weak, and ignorant\" (all very debatable things, mind you; for instance, [the Five Civilized Tribes had a higher literacy and education rate than their white neighbors](http://books.google.com/books?id=Po1vsDfBCoIC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=%22By+the+time+of+the+Civil+War,+the+Five+Civilized+Tribes+boasted+a+higher+literacy+rate+and+a+higher+educational+level+than+their+surrounding+white+neighbors.%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bApYVOuxKbOJsQTzt4GQDw&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22By%20the%20time%20of%20the%20Civil%20War%2C%20the%20Five%20Civilized%20Tribes%20boasted%20a%20higher%20literacy%20rate%20and%20a%20higher%20educational%20level%20than%20their%20surrounding%20white%20neighbors.%22&amp;f=false)) due to Western imperialism. Fortunately for the writer of this article, west stronk, so the rest is all superfluous fluff that really is unnecessary for the average historian. Hooray for Eurocentrism! \n\n&gt;Indeed, it can be reasonably argued that the calamity might well never have come to pass at all if only the imperial throne of Germany had been occupied by someone other than that supreme jerk Kaiser Wilhelm II.\n\n~~R5 Explanation: the only supreme jerk is /r/badhistory~~\n\n\n&gt;at the time of [Marx's] death, in 1883, his grand vision stood no more chance of adoption by the real world than had Sir Thomas More’s Utopia three hundred and fifty years earlier.\n\nAnd that's why [dialectical materialism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism) never existed in any capacity. Now we know!\n\n&gt;Germany depended on its economic and military might for its prestige, until its one unquestioned superiority—its incomparable army—was nonetheless defeated.\n\nThe Imperial Army was strong, I'll give you that. However, its navy was soundly thrashed by Britain, and furthermore, its overconfidence in its militaristic prowess is possibly why it performed such foolhardy acts as the Schlieffen plan:  \n\"In the final phase of the operation/campaign called for by the Schlieffen Plan, the German right wing was supposed to be \"outflanking that position (the Verdun–Marne–Paris line) by advancing west of Paris across the lower Seine\" but in 1914 \"Moltke’s right wing was operating east of Paris against an enemy position connected to the capital city... he had no right wing at all in comparison with the Schlieffen plan.\" Breaching the Paris–Marne–Verdun line was impossible with the forces available to Moltke.\" [Citation: [T.M. Holmes, via Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlieffen_Plan)]\n\n&gt;[Post-WWII economic and social systems] tended to concentrate power, rather than disperse it as the nineteenth century had done.\n\nAh, yes! The dispersal of economic power! Like [Standard Oil.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Oil)\n\n&gt;Of all the inventions of the nineteenth century, capitalism and representative democracy turned out to be the greatest.\n\nThank God we invented capitalism so that we could send it back to ancient Rome so they could mint coins and implement our genius! And also every society before Rome that utilized any sort of barter system! Even confining capitalism to a more modern definition, it really goes [as far back as the sixteenth century with the rise of agrarian capitalism](http://monthlyreview.org/1998/07/01/the-agrarian-origins-of-capitalism/). (While looking for sources, I found [an article on the history behind the disparity between the American and British ways of handling silverware.](http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=f62870e0-27a7-4e84-9309-3a262d5b147b%40sessionmgr198&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=124) I never knew I needed this, but I do.)\n\nI am not nearly well-versed enough in Marxist theory to tackle the large portion of the article regarding that, so I think it's time to leave it at this. I hope you've enjoyed my virgin voyage, fellow supreme jerks.\n\n\nBONUS! Analogies akin to a down quark being observed outside a hadron:\n&gt;we look at that world now across what a mathematician might call a discontinuity in the stream of time.  \n\n \n&gt;But hubris, like the winner in a horse race, can be much more easily discerned in retrospect.\n\n \n&gt; But the followers of Marx regarded his theories about society and economics as the equal of Newton’s theory in physics: the universal explainer of all observed phenomena.",

Haigh contends that there was a bedrock of Parish Anglicans, whose sympathies still lay with the RCC, and Protestantism was slow to spread, which is, I think, the general consensus, but some historians (my notes give Maltby as an example, but that by no means means that he is the only or most well known one...) think that by James' ascent to the English throne, the vast majority of people were devoted Anglicans.\n\nSadly, it's all downhill from there. The commenter gives no plausible reason (or, indeed, reason at all) why the workmen would particularly have wanted to keep James away from Knole house, which is the first stumbling block. Saying that the workmen (may have been) Catholic is all very well and good, but why did they care whether James visited Knole house? Let's file the first paragraph in B, for 'baseless speculation'.\n\nThe next paragraph opens with the stunning revelation that \"there was no plot, there was no gunpowder\". Now, I may be optimistic, but I would have thought that if that were the case, in 400 years, at least one historian might have actually, you know, noticed that they were writing about an event which never happened. Not that this brilliant and original insight is backed up by any evidence, mind you. Nor any motive for Robert Cecil to have masterminded this plot. After all, it's not like this led to a crackdown on Catholicism in Britain. Sure, there were some increases in recusancy fines, but if I was going to mastermind a false-flag terrorist operation, I'd want to get something a little more... concrete... out of it. By contrast, what actually happened was that, as Molin, the Venetian ambassador reported, the council decided that \"[it did] not follow that all professing that Romish religion were guiltie of the same [treason]\", and by the 23rd of November believed that there was no further cause for alarm as the conspirators were captured.\n\nOn the other hand, it seems entirely plausible that Catholics might have wanted to murder James. After all, at least two other European monarchs had previously been assassinated by Catholics after being excommunicated, William the Silent of Orange, and Henri III of France. In 1605, there were persistent rumours that James would be next. Killing James was already close to being given the Pope's blessing, or at least so it was thought. And there clearly was a fear that Catholics would kill James: in 1606, there was a rumour that James had been murdered in Woking, which was taken sufficiently seriously that the guard on the Tower of London was doubled; in 1608, there was a rumour that 5 Jesuits were coming from the continent to assassinate James and his son Henry; in 1610, Sir Edwin Rich reported that a leading Jesuit was planning to poison the king; in 1612 the Archbishop of Cantebury was attacked by a Catholic with a knife. Not only was there widespread fear of these kinds of attacks, they did actually happen.\n\nFinally, our intrepid commenter suggests that \"England at the time was like Ulster in ours\". Umm, no. It's still the case that in Belfast there are 40-foot high 'peace walls' between Catholic and Protestant areas, and that (London)Derry has a different name depending on what side of the political divide you are on. Ulster is divided over two separate countries. There are still (fewer than there were before the Good Friday agreement, but still) relatively frequent terrorist attacks by partisans of the two sides.  Not only is this statement wrong; if it were true it would support the idea that the Gunpowder plot did happen.",

To quote the specific bad history:\n\n&gt; \"The United States can celebrate Independence Day, but they must remember the Russian Navy helped their struggle against the British colonialists. The Europeans can speak about democracy and human rights but the Soviet army liberated Europe from fascism which is again rising in west Ukraine and other areas.\"\n\nThere are two claims here. \n\nFirst, that the Russian Navy helped liberate the Thirteen Colonies from their British overlords. This is stretching the truth somewhat since the Russia did not participate as a belligerent to any great extent during the war, and did not declare war. The only actions I was able to find were [two in which Russian ships captured British merchant cargo, obtaining some hemp and iron in the process.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy_in_the_American_Revolutionary_War#Russia) This is hardly war-winning material, barring redcoats obtaining superpowers from THC. \n\nSecond, that the Soviets liberated Europe from fascism. This is stretching the truth a little less, but is still not an accurate picture of what really happened. WWII, even Russia's vaunted eastern front, was a team effort.  [American supplies were ferried along multiple routes to aid Russia on that front](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lend-Lease#US_deliveries_to_the_USSR), and Russia did not even participate directly in the liberation of much of Europe, including Norway, France, Italy, Denmark, Belgium, and The Netherlands.

We must finish with the Serbs, quickly. Now or never!”.[39] In response, Tschirschky told the Austro-Hungarian government that same day that “Germany would support the Monarchy through thick and thin, whatever action it decided to take against Serbia. The sooner Austria-Hungary struck, the better”.[42] On July 5, 1914, Count Moltke, the Chief of the German General Staff, wrote that “Austria must beat the Serbs”.\n\nEven if Russia were to act in defence of Serbia, Wilhelm promised that Germany would do everything in its power, including war, to support Austria-Hungary.[42]\nAfter his meeting, Szögyény reported to Vienna that Wilhelm “would regret it if we [Austria-Hungary] let this present chance, which was so favourable for us, go by without utilising it”.[45] This so-called “blank cheque” of German support up to and including war was to be the main determining factor in Austrian policy in July 1914.[45] At a meeting held also on the 5th at Potsdam palace, the German Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg, the Foreign Ministry’s State Secretary Arthur Zimmermann, the Minister of War Erich von Falkenhayn, the head of the German Imperial Military Cabinet Moriz von Lyncker, the Adjutant general Hans von Plessen, Captain Hans Zenker of the Naval General Staff, and Admiral Eduard von Capelle of the Naval State Secretariat all endorsed Wilhelm’s “blank cheque” as Germany’s best policy.[45] When asked if Germany was ready for a war against Russia and France, Falkenhayn replied with a “curt affirmative”.[45] Later on July 17th, the Army’s Quartermaster general Count Waldersee wrote to the Foreign Minister von Jagow: “I can move at a moment’s notice. We in the General Staff are ready: there is nothing more for us to do at this juncture”.[45]\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_Crisis#German_attitude_to_war\n",

So far, pretty awesome for History.\nThen this guy opens up, and says:\n\n&gt;Artifacts are hastily stowed these days as many findings do not fit with the current and popular story of human history.\n&gt;Though it's likely these findings in particular wouldn't be unexpected, it'll be months at least before we hear anything of this again (from my experiences).\n\nAnd he follows this up with his own brand of quackery.\n\n&gt;Which ever establishment lays claim to them first. Some are swept up by local governments first and distributed to museums, however the system in the &gt;country works. Some are basically left in the hands of those who found it but none that might disrupt current theories are ever brought to light (edit: in a big &gt;way).\n\n&gt;There are many artifacts stored away in many museums, most waiting for their exhibit to come around again but some stored indefinitely. They're either &gt;invaluable for research or the artifact(s) should not even exist given the geographical location it was found and / or the dating methods used indicate it's far &gt;older than it should be, according to popular history.\n\n&gt;History is going to be re-written when the issues must be addressed and it isn't going to be one of cavemen. It's kind of like if a physicist theorized that &gt;gravity doesn't exist (for as shocking an example) based on irrefutable proof he's come across (silly, I know). Now there's two directions the world can take. &gt;Consider the proof and re-work everything many physicists have worked hard to establish over centuries or choose to ignore this bit of evidence and continue &gt;trying to fit together the pieces within their current model.\n\n&gt;It may seem like the obvious choice to overhaul the model but sadly, this isn't the way these issues tend to work. It isn't until the evidence is piled to the roof &gt;that consideration is made. As far as my experience, being alive and having an interest in history :)\n\nHistorians (and archaeologists) of Reddit, take note; **this guy openly says his sources are from being alive**.\n\nSome valiant skeptic actually asks him what's wrong with the findings, and he starts a diatribe of egyptology and pseudohistory, which I'm going to dissect piece by piece.\n\nFirstly, he claims that the sphinx is way older, and lines up with the rising sun on the equinox 'during the age of leo'\n\n&gt;Geologists agree sphinx has water erosion, the only theory that fits with our knowledge of geology is that it was caused by decades of water running down &gt;the sphinx during periods of heavy rainfall\n\n&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphinx_water_erosion_hypothesis\n\n&gt;(Note the first thing they say about the theory is that it was first proposed by a mystic, right off the bat they [yes, the people contributing to wikipedia] try to &gt;discredit it with ad hominem.)\n\n&gt;Egyptologists say \"no\", because.... they say no. It doesn't fit their theory even though it is solid science, and so they ignore it.\n\nI'm going to point out that the first thing he says after claiming that this theory is being attacked with an *ad hominiem* is to then immediately *ad hominem* people who actually study the subject.\n\n&gt;Where does the Great Sphinx point? To the rising sun on the equinox (as do multiple temple layouts in Egypt). When would this have made any sense? &gt;During the age of Leo. When was the age of Leo (axial precession, quick google will explain it)? Over ~10,000 years ago. When was the last time the area &gt;had enough rainfall to explain the water erosion on the Sphinx? You guessed it\n\nWhy is this badhistory? Firstly, the wikipedia article he links to *as his evidence* also discredits his theory:\n\n&gt;One of the alternative erosion mechanisms proposed is called haloclasty. Moisture on limestone will dissolve salts, which are then carried by percolating &gt;moisture into the spaces inside the porous limestone. When the moisture dries the salt crystallises, and the expanding crystals cause a fine layer of surface &gt;limestone to flake off. It is accepted by Schoch et al. that this mechanism is evident in many places on the Giza Plateau. One proponent of the haloclasty &gt;process is Dr James A. Harrell of the University of Toledo, who advocates that the deep erosion crevices were caused by the haloclasty process being driven &gt;by moisture in the sand that covered the carved rock for much of the time since it was exposed by quarrying.[10] Lal Gauri et al.[24] also favour the &gt;haloclasty process to explain the erosion features, but have theorised that the weathering was driven by moisture deriving from atmospheric precipitation &gt;such as dew.\n\nOr:\n\n&gt;Zahi Hawass, former Egyptian minister of state for antiquities affairs and secretary-general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, was asked in an interview &gt;on the PBS series NOVA if it was possible that a more ancient civilization might have sculpted the Sphinx. Hawass replied: \"Of course it is not possible for one &gt;reason …. No single artifact, no single inscription, or pottery, or anything has been found until now, in any place to predate the Egyptian civilization more than &gt;5,000 years ago.\" This reasoning and conclusion was supported in a similar NOVA interview by Mark Lehner, another senior Egyptologist. Other &gt;archaeologists who have made similar criticisms include Kenneth Feder.\n\nHowever, I'd like to move on to his points that can be disproven more conclusively.\n\n&gt;How do you get the circumference (perimeter) of a circle? 2 times the radius times pi\n\n&gt;How do you get the perimeter of the great pyramid? 2 times the height times pi.\n\n&gt;Either the craziest mathematical coincidence in history that they built it with exactly a 3.14 proportion, or it was meant to be that way\n\n&gt;Egyptologists: No... the significance of pi was not known until middle ancient Greece. Must be a coincidence.\n\n&gt;The pyramids in the proportional distances line up perfectly with the belt of Orion. Multiple pyramids do this, two in straight line and the third off center, with &gt;distance in proportion to the belt of Orion\n\n&gt;http://files.abovetopsecret.com/files/img/fp50f866ad.jpg\n\n&gt;Egyptologists: No... because fuck off. NO\n\nWell, according to this washington.edu (https://www.math.washington.edu/~greenber/PiPyr.html) essay I found, he's talking, as my father might say 'total bollocks'.\n\nTo quote: \n\n&gt;  The main point that I will make in this essay is that when one takes into account what we know about ancient Egyptian mathematics (based primarily on the Rhind Papyrus), especially their ways of representing lengths and slopes, then the relationship between &amp;pi and the Great Pyramid no longer seems very remarkable. The essential point is that the measurement system which the ancient Egyptians used would lead the architects to use certain slopes in the design of pyramids. One of those slopes just happens to be an excellent approximation to the number 4/&amp;pi, and if the architect chooses that slope, then the pyramid would exhibit the famous &amp;pi relationship. From this point of view, the probability that the architect might choose that particular slope for at least one of the pyramids is actually rather high. It then becomes quite reasonable to believe that the relationship between &amp;pi and the Great Pyramid is just an accidental consequence of their Mathematics. \n\nThe essay goes on to explain the exact mathematics behind this, but I didn't want to post it all here, as it's quite long.\n\nA simple look at Wikipedia contradict the Orion correlation he mentions, too:\n\n&gt;Among these critiques are several from two astronomers, Ed Krupp of Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles and Anthony Fairall, astronomy professor at the &gt;University of Cape Town, South Africa. Using planetarium equipment, Krupp and Fairall independently investigated the angle between the alignment of Orion's &gt;Belt and north during the era cited by Hancock, Bauval, et al. (which differs from the angle seen today or in the 3rd millennium BC, because of the precession &gt;of the equinoxes), and found that the angle was somewhat different from the \"perfect match\" claimed by Bauval and Hancock in the Orion Constellation &gt;Theory—47–50 degrees per the planetarium measurements, compared to the 38-degree angle formed by the pyramids.[9]\n\n&gt;Krupp also pointed out that the slightly-bent line formed by the three pyramids was deviated towards the north, whereas the slight \"kink\" in the line of &gt;Orion's Belt was deformed to the south, and to match them up one or the other of them had to be turned upside-down.[10] Indeed, this is what was done in &gt;the original book by Bauval and Gilbert (The Orion Mystery), which compared images of the pyramids and Orion without revealing that the pyramids’ map had &gt;been inverted.[11] Krupp and Fairall find other problems with the claims, including noting that if the Sphinx is meant to represent the constellation of Leo, &gt;then it should be on the opposite side of the Nile (the \"Milky Way\") from the pyramids (\"Orion\"),[9][10] that the vernal equinox c. 10,500 BC was in Virgo &gt;and not Leo,[9] and that in any case the constellations of the Zodiac originate from Mesopotamia and were completely unknown in Egypt until the much later &gt;Graeco-Roman era.\n\nHe also mentions that the worship of Apis, a Bull deity, has significance with regard to the age of Taurus:\n\n&gt;We find lots of Bull worship in Egypt during a certain era. Lots of prayer to Apis (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apis_(god)). A grand pyramid and structure &gt;dedicated, and in the great burial chamber is buried.... a mummified bull. Oddly the dates line up with...the end of the age of Taurus.\n\nI can't speak to the motivation of the ancient Egyptians as to why they worshiped Apis, but the *wikipedia article he gives as his only evidence states that Apis worship continued into the 4th c. AD, and a quick check confirms that the age of Taurus [regardless of whether or not it actually exists, which is another matter] ends between 2150 and 1875 BC, over 2000 years before the worship of Apis ended.*\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrological_age#The_Age_of_Taurus_.28The_Taurean_Age.29\n\nOh, and he proves in his conclusion that he is indeed a lovely person (yes, I'm being sarcastic):\n\n&gt;I understand none of this is conclusive, it's not a conclusive theory. But these are facts, and orthodox egyptology is full of over-inflated egos with a theory &gt;that is full of tattered holes, and who refuse to even consider new findings in their framework. Don't trust them, and let's stop teaching their bullshit in schools\n\nAnd that, gentlefolk of /r/badhistory, is my first post in this fair place.\n\nEDIT: formatting\n\n",

        "text": "Of course, when Dylan recounted it, it was more current events than history—but given it's a song still widely known today, and one that kept alive a story that otherwise would've been forgotten, it counts as a telling of history just the same.\n\nThis is going to be a short one, as there isn't much to pick out from Dylan's account. And whatever there is owes to pretty heavy pedantry. I did another one of these long ago for Dylan's song \"With God on Our Side,\" which was pretty damn pedantic as well—if not more so.\n\nThe song, of course, is \"The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll,\" which was written by Dylan in 1963 after arriving in New York following his presence at the 1963 March on Washington. It was on his way back that he learned of the sentence of William Zantzinger—initially charged with murder—for manslaughter for having caused the death of a black barmaid in Baltimore in a drunken rage.\n\nThe lyrics to the song can be found [here,](http://www.bobdylan.com/us/songs/lonesome-death-hattie-carroll) while a live performance of the song can be found [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gI-K-lxDsZk) (The studio version as released in *The Times They Are a-Changin'* doesn't seem to be available on YouTube.)\n\nNow, there are some errors and misrepresentations in the song that are indeed worth addressing, even if done for effect or out of artistic license. This being a sub largely devoted to pedantry, I'll ignore the purpose and focus instead on the facts:\n\nFirst, Dylan misspells Zantzinger's name. In the song, he refers to him multiple times as William \"Zanzinger.\"\n\nAlso, The first stanza implies that the cops arrived to a scene of a hostile Zantzinger and a victim, Hattie Carroll. This isn't the case. They were called in to deal with the disturbance that Zantzinger had caused, which involved assaults of two other employees at the hotel and multiple blows to Carroll with a toy cane he had in his possession, as well as a merciless assault of his own wife. Carroll and all other victims of his assault were fully conscious—much less deceased—when the police arrived. The police additionally were not aware of the assault of Hattie Carroll when they arrested him, and disorderly conduct was the only charge at first. Carroll reported feeling ill to a coworker, saying \"I feel deathly ill, that man has upset me so.\" She collapsed subsequently and was hospitalized not long after the assault, and died at Mercy Hospital the morning after the incident (a span of about eight hours). The physician reported hardened arteries, an enlarged heart, and hypertension.\n\nSo, when Dylan wrote the following in his song, it was mostly inaccurate:\n\n&gt;And the cops were called in and his weapon took from him\n\n&gt;As they rode him in custody down to the station\n\n&gt;And booked William Zanzinger for first-degree murder\n\nAnd, for the most part, this:\n\n&gt;[Carroll] Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane\n\n&gt;That sailed through the air and came down through the room\n\n&gt;Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle\n\n&gt;And she never done nothing to William Zanzinger\n\nThe provocation for the assult in Zantzinger's eyes was a delay between ordering his drink (a bourbon) and actually receiving it. Of course, no reasonable person would say that warrants an assault, so we can take this as what Dylan means by that last line. However, the three lines before it are a bit of a misrepresentation as well, including the part I addressed above about how the assault itself did not leave Carroll laying \"slain by a cain\". The physician's report claimed that it was likely stress from Zantzinger's verbal and physical assault that caused the complications leading to Carroll's death, and were in part why the court still found him responsible for it but nevertheless agreed with a reduction of the charge to third-degree murder/manslaughter, as there was no proof that Zantzinger intended to kill Mrs. Carroll, or \"destroy all the gentle\"—even if it was clear that he had been acting in an immature, disorderly manner and only offered the rather pitiful defense that he was intoxicated and had blacked out the incident.\n\nIn the final stanza Dylan rightly criticizes the way the law came down on Zantzinger, but still gets a couple things wrong:\n\n&gt;In the courtroom of honor, the judge pounded his gavel\n\nZantzinger's trial was actually handled by three judges, not one, and absent any jury of his peers.\n\n&gt;Stared at the person who killed for no reason\n\n&gt;Who just happened to be feelin’ that way without warnin’\n\nAs I state above, there was no evidence of murderous intent, which is why the charge was reduced to manslaughter. Dylan's right to criticize the man for his vile nature and hideous racism, but this bit is rather unsupported.\n\n&gt;And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished\n\n&gt;And handed out strongly, for penalty and repentance\n\n&gt;William Zanzinger with a six-month sentence\n\nThis criticism is pretty warranted, as there is reason to suspect that the notoriety of the case as well as Zantzinger's social status did win him mercy in his sentencing. For one, as a farmer, his sentence was delayed until 15 Sept. to allow him to collect his tobacco harvest. (This was commonly done for farmers.) The six-month sentence, moreover, seemed to have been designed to keep him out of a state penitentiary, in which he would've been serving time mostly among black inmates. The *New York Herald Tribune* surmised that the decision to have him sentenced to six months at Washington County county jail was made out of concern for his safety. The same paper quoted Zantzinger on his sentence: \"I'll just miss a lot of snow.\"\n\nThe song depicts Zantzinger and his family of pulling strings in local politics to lessen his sentence. I'm not sure how true that is, though it's plausible given that Zantzinger had a very privileged upbringing and that his father served on the Maryland legislature. But the greater point Dylan was making was that his social position and race did factor into the judgement. That conjecture is better supported by primary accounts—both by *Time Magazine* and the *Herald Tribune.*\n\nPerhaps I should fine a Bob Dylan forum in which to post this. Might get me banned, like /u/smileyman did from a Bruce Springsteen forum.",

Sadly I won't be pursuing it any further.\n\nThe comic sets the stage by letting us know that we're in the colony of Massachusetts and the date is June 2, 1779. The primary character appears to be a young boy of indeterminate age, perhaps 11 or 12?, who has just had a dream where he was summoned to a secret meeting of Patriots and threatened with death because he wouldn't reveal the location of the bird.\n\nTwo **major** problems with this\n\n1.) If this is indeed set in 1779, there would be no need for a secret Patriot meeting, as there would be no royal authority anywhere in the colony of Massachusetts. In fact there had been no royal authority anywhere in Massachusetts since 1775 (outside of Boston and it's immediate environs) since 1775, and Boston would lose it's royal authority in 1776.\n\n2.) The cover art implies that the bird being sought is an eagle. The eagle was not a symbol of the American Revolution, and didn't come to symbolize America until later. Benjamin Franklin famously suggested that the turkey would be a better symbol than the eagle (though his suggestion was at least half satire).\n\nWe then have a scene with the youngest child running around screaming \"Beware Ye Towies de Liberty Eagle strikes again!\" and making references to \"Redcoats\" and \"the British\". \n\nMore anachronisms here. Any child of 1779 would have referred to British troops as regulars, or perhaps lobsterbacks, not redcoats. Also reference to the \"Liberty Eagle\" again.\n\nThe older brother is worried that the play will upset the constable and the neighbors. Not in late 18th century Massachusetts it won't. This is the same colony that several times before April 19, 1775 mustered out thousands of men to defy British authority--and one of those times it mustered out tens of thousands of men (the Powder Alarm). This is the colony that was preparing and laying up supplies to provision an army of 15,000 men and which had a major supply depot at Concord and another at Worcester. The neighbors would have been upset if the boy had been going around saying \"Beware Ye Patriots!\"\n\nEventually the middle child and oldest brother head off to Boston because the middle child has been apprenticed to a Tory merchant. They come to a crossroads and see an effigy hung with a sign saying \"Patriot\" on it. Yet another anachronism, as the members of the popular resistance would have generally referred to themselves as \"Whigs\", and those who would hang them in effigy would certainly have called them \"rebels\".\n\nAlso in 1779 there were no British in Boston. When the British *were* in Boston in 1776 they were surrounded by militia. In 1775 before the outbreak of war, there actually weren't checkpoints, which makes this whole scene badhistory.\n\nOh look, it's the evil British soldier trope. Also the stupid one who's going to rape a woman in broad daylight like there was no punishment for it (there was--even during the war there were trials held for British soldiers who committed rape. It didn't stop them from doing it and the treatment of civilians by British and Hessian soldiers in New Jersey was one reason for a particularly vicious insurgency, but it was officially punished.)\n\nAs a side note there's some evidence to suggest that grenadiers probably wouldn't have worn their grenadier caps while on duty in the city, but regular cocked hats. Nor would regular soldiers have likely worn wigs--they would have been more likely to have worn their hair long in a queue. \n\nThe whole scene with summary execution of a child for throwing a rock is simply ridiculous--it would never have happened even under martial law.\n\n",

        "text": "Or [*Homage to Catalonia: The Movie*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114671/)\n\n***\n\nI wasn't quite sure exactly how to format this, so I decided just to divide it into the scenes where there is something to point out as being wrong or overly simplified. A couple of scenes I felt there weren't any glaring mistakes that I could spot and were worth pointing out. \n***\n\n**The Into Title Cards**\n\nHere we've got a veeery simplified introduction as to the background of the Spanish Civil War. According to this film, it was just the landowners and wealthy getting scared of the growing power of the working class. It was rather more complicated than that, although I doubt too many people would want to read a book's worth of exposition for an hour and a half long film. The roots of the Spanish Civil War can go back a very long time, back to the loss of Cuba in 1898 and the Spanish colonial expeditions and wars in Morocco, which sort of came as a major blow to the pride of the Spanish military in the early 20th century. \n\nTo simplify a bit, since I don't think you want to read a book here either, after the disaster at Annoual in Morocco in 1921 and the lacklustre performance of the Army in Morocco, Primo de Rivera was proclaimed dictator in a pronunciamiento. His rule was rather unpopular and by 1930 he was dismissed by the King, but the damage was already done to the monarchy as it was seen to have supported his regime, and the Republic was founded the year after and the King sent into exile. The next few years were a period of, as Preston describes, polarisation and radicalisation between the left and right, especially with the *bienio negro* of the CEDA government and the Asturias rebellion. \n\nOh right, the movie. Yeah, it's pretty much simplifying everything down to a nice inspirational and revolutionary line that pretty much sums up the intention of the whole film. There's also the description of the coup as “led by the Fascist General Franco”. This is wrong in several ways. For a start, Franco was neither the intended leader nor the planner of the coup. Much of the planning for the July 1936 coup was done by Mola, who slowly faded into obscurity in his struggle to conquer the north then died in a plane crash in mid 1937. Sanjurjo was intended from the very beginning to be the new leader of Spain after the planned coup, but he conveniently died in a plane crash in the first days of the war. From July to October there was no real single leader of the Nationalists, with Mola, Franco and Queipo de Llano being a sort of triumvirate. In October Franco was appointed as Generalisimo of nationalist forces. From then on we can safely say he was leader of the nationalists. The other way in which it is wrong is describing Franco as a fascist. There're whole books on this, but to summarise, Franco is usually described as a reactionary traditionalist, or simply just Francoist, since he rejected many of the modernist ideas the Falange espoused and was really just into making himself the most powerful person and securing his rule, slowly placing all the factions of the nationalists under his control.  \n\n**Travelling to Spain**\n\nThe main character here explains how he's been smuggled into France and into Spain without any papers to join the war. What happened to that meeting he was at earlier? It's mentioned later that he was a Communist Party member, which sponsored its members with all the papers needed to go and fight in Spain in the International Brigades. Apparently this guy decided not to make his life easier in that regard and just went alone. Probably made it easier to drive the plot towards the POUM. \n\n**Women**\n\nA lot of the points I found in the next few scenes were about women in the militias and on the front, so I decided just to condense them down into one section. \n\nIn the POUM barracks, we see men and a fair few women drilling together. This is a bit off. Whilst there were women fighting alongside men at the outbreak of the war, by the time the war had set in properly, women dwindled in number in combat units. If this really is *Homage to Catalonia: The Movie* as it pretty much is, they should have realised that Orwell mentioned that there were only a handful of women, aside from the wives of the militiamen, and they were mostly separate from the rest of the militia. Similarly, when they get to the front, there're a decent amount of women fighting side by side with the militia, contrary to what happened on the most part. Orwell describes his section of the front as having only three women, who mostly just did the cooking for the men and didn't fight all that often. \n\n\n**Capturing the Town**\n\nFirstly, lol at the Republicans actually capturing a town this smoothly. They were pretty renowned for well planned but dreadfully carried out offensives throughout the war, and never really had a major victory that wasn't a defensive operation. Also, in the period that this is set (between February 1937, as they mention the fall of Malaga later, and May 1937, as the May Days are a later event in the film) and in this part of the front, there were no offensives made by the Republican forces. In fact, the Aragon front became known for being a rather quiet front compared to the rest of the country until 1938, so I wonder why they were assaulting. \n\nThe priest shooting from the church was an event that did happen in the war, but it was a rather rare occurrence, and I feel that it's kind of trying to justify the shooting of the priest later. The anti-clerical violence in the republican zone was rather out of hand and many priests were shot for having sympathies with the nationalists, and also as revenge for the historic domination the Catholic Church held over the country. Although, in such small towns, the local priest was often just as poor as the rest of the village, and thus often also fairly friendly with the people, contrary to the hate that this poor chap gets. /u/Domini_canes can probably elaborate a bit more on the anti-clerical violence depicted here. \n\n\n**The Meeting**\n\nThe whole meeting scene is a bit of a soapbox for the politics of the POUM and anarchists really. I s'pose it's a nice way of introducing the basic ideas that the organisations held during the war, but I highly doubt they collectivised in this manner. Also, the ratio of collectivists to individualists was a bit different on the larger scale. Here we've only got one individualists, but throughout the Aragon region there were approx. 150k individualists to 200k collectivists. \n\nThe meeting is also kind of silly, since they've only just captured it from the nationalists. Instead, they should be building up the defensives for the inevitable counterattack. Franco's command of the war was notorious for such counterattacks as he wished to eliminate opposition as much as possible and to give no ground to the Republicans. Even minor gains by the Republicans were pushed back in force by Franco, a major example of which was the Alcazar at Toledo, which Franco took instead of using the time to attack Madrid when it was at its weakest. \n\n\n**The Final Confrontation Scene**\n\nAfter the May Days in Barcelona much of what is said in this scene is true. The POUM was declared illegal, its paper closed and leadership arrested. The way in which they did it with the militias out on the front though was a bit different. The Popular Army captain here announces that the militia was to be disbanded and all members sent home, apart from some who were to be arrested. The arrests did happen in real life, with quite a few commanders and officers going to prison, including Orwell's, but the members weren't simply sent home. The disbanded POUM militias were absorbed and conscripted back into the Popular Army, since mandatory conscription had been implemented, with anyone resisting or refusing declared to be deserters. \n\n***\n\nSo yeah, Land and Freedom is pretty much a film adaptation of *Homage to Catalonia* but with some minor changes, such as this guy being in the PSUC for the May Days. It's not exactly wrong in most respects, but since it's just from Orwell's perspective it's more just limited. What you see is their experience and not the experience of the majority of Spaniards in the civil war (the POUM was pretty small y'know). But anyway, thanks for reading. I wrote this at 2am last night so forgive me. \n\n\n",

        "text": "When I find bad history that I want to comment on, I open a tab with it and let it sit there and think about what's it's done until I get around to writing about it. Currently, I have eleven tabs open, and they are all from this one stupid, stupid thread. What thread is this? Why, [this one](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2kidis/what_invention_of_the_last_50_years_would_least/) from a few days ago in AskReddit! AskReddit, as we all know, is a bastion of good history, science, and ethics, but this thread is just amazing. It misunderstands both the 18th century and when things were invented. Rather than doing eleven different posts, I'm just going to be lazy and go through the comments I found in one ridiculous post. \n\nWe'll start with [this one](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2kidis/what_invention_of_the_last_50_years_would_least/cllnvn2?context=2) about a weird rotating chair:\n\n&gt; ...to someone living in the 1700s, sitting on a hard oak bench, The Hawaii Chair would be the shit. They may consider it to be the pinnacle of humanity.\n\nFun fact! Wikipedia has an [article on the history of chairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_chair#18th_century_chairs), something which just reminds me why Wikipedia is so amazing. This page includes images like [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0b/FdeTroyLectureMoliere.jpg) which show some chairs of 18th century France. They look ridiculously comfortable to me, and a far cry, certainly, from the \"hard wooden benches\" claimed by the poster. Indeed, upholstered chairs in Europe can be traced back to the Renaissance, and farther back (possibly to the 12th century) in China. Chairs themselves go as far back as ancient Egypt, and likely farther. [This](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Sitamun_chair_replica_1.jpg/250px-Sitamun_chair_replica_1.jpg) is a replica of an ancient Egyptian pharoah's chair. It looks decently comfy, I think, though I'll agree, it's no [Hawaii Chair](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9_amg-Aos4).\n\n\"Aha!\" you say. \"But the chairs you've showed so far belonged to nobility! What did peasants sit on? Surely they'd love the Hawaii Chair!\" On this point, I'd like to direct you to Florence de Dampierre's book \"Chairs: A History.\" In this book, she talks a bit about common peoples' chairs. Chairs for common people, while not as opulent as those of nobility, most certainly existed by the 18th century. Once again, in 12th century China, chairs were widespread, and chairs were a fixture in European homes by the Renaissance. Even before this, stools existed throughout the world, and while they're not *technically* chairs, I'm going to count them anyway because I feel like it.\n\nNext we have [this comment](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2kidis/what_invention_of_the_last_50_years_would_least/clllcfr):\n\n&gt; Reduced fat food and vegetarian meat substitutes.\nYou needed those calories back in the 1700s.\n\nI won't touch on the bad understanding of nutrition in there, but instead focus on the idea that vegetarianism wasn't a thing in the 1700s. I can tell that there's a European bias here, especially given that there are [huge numbers of people in non-Western cultures who practice vegetarianism and have for quite some time](http://www.vegetarians.co.nz/articles/500-million-vegetarians-in-india/). Mahayana Buddhism is famous for strongly suggesting its followers [practice vegetarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_vegetarianism), something that has been the case since Buddhism's inception. The oldest documents of Mahayana Buddhism specifically date back to the 1st century BCE, but the debates in Theravada Buddhism likely extend to well before that. Indian vegetarianism, as well, though it has fluctuated in popularity and practicality, has its roots in at least the 8th century BCE. I suspect that the idea that future people might still be vegetarians wouldn't blow their minds. \n\nBut once again, maybe the poster assumed the question was only talking about Europe. If that's the case, it's stupid, but still, let's look at vegetarianism in Europe. The earliest records of vegetarianism in Europe are of the ancient Greeks. Vegetarianism is referred to in [The Odyssey](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136%3Abook%3D9%3Acard%3D82), and Plato talks about [the Orphics](http://www.ivu.org/history/greece_rome/greek.html) refraining from eating meat as they saw it as akin to cannibalism. Even beyond the ancient world, refraining from meat is a common theme for Christian fasts, and they seemed to do just fine. In the average medieval diet, [meat was a rarity](http://people.eku.edu/resorc/Medieval_peasant_diet.htm) due to the expense. It's not until the 17th and 18th centuries that meat became more of the staple of a diet that we know today, and then, it still depended on where you lived. In England, for instance, meat was [much easier to obtain](http://www.umich.edu/~ece/student_projects/food/foods.htm) than in the [colonies](http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodcolonial.html). Certainly they didn't seem to suffer massive caloric insufficiencies because of a lack of meat. \n\nAnd what about low calorie foods? While he's a bit past the 18th century, [Lord Byron](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-16351761) popularised a diet with the intention of losing weight. While I don't know much about the history of dieting, I do suspect that for those who shared a mind with Lord Byron - and the article I linked presents several - low calorie foods would be amazing, likely moreso than the Hawaii Chair.\n\nWhat's next? Well, I'll put two comments together because they're very similar. They can be found [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2kidis/what_invention_of_the_last_50_years_would_least/cllmcs9) and [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2kidis/what_invention_of_the_last_50_years_would_least/cllrkqy). \n\n&gt; The thong.\nI imagine it would be pretty difficult to explain the usefulness to any culture where the citizens to not regularly wear the garment.\n\n&gt; Since women wore what was basically crotchless undergarments during that time period they would have to wonder why we bother.\n\nThere are two aspects of bad history to cover here, but I'll start with the history of underpants since that's way more fun. [Here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/PiazzaArmerina-Mosaik-Bikini.jpg/170px-PiazzaArmerina-Mosaik-Bikini.jpg) is a picture of a Roman woman wearing underpants. Underwear as a concept is likely much older. If nothing else, loincloths are basically the same thing, though admittedly, those were initially worn as outerwear. However, it remained a staple of undergarments in Europe until the Middle Ages (it still is a staple in some Asian cultures. As an example, take the Japanese [fundoshi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundoshi) It was also dreadfully popular among Native Americans, as illustrated by [this lovely fellow](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/Nezahualpiltzintli.jpg) from the 16th century.). For many people around the world, a thong would not be anything spectacularly new. It would fit right in, or at worst, be seen as a bit strange for a woman to be wearing. However, it's well-worth mentioning that in some Native American societies - such as the Mojave - women would wear men's loincloths as a symbol of their status. Even there, a thong wouldn't be seen as too radically different.\n\nOnce again, though, there's an implied Eurocentrism, so let's have a look at European 18th century undergarments. The garment of choice for both men and women was the [chemise](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-TlQeSbz-4Yc/UUCi-CbYEFI/AAAAAAAAABc/fjPRGY8FOY4/s1600/Chemise+1+web.jpg), a long shirt that could be worn under other garments. It's debated what was under this, though it's largely been believed that men were the only ones with underpants underneath. However, there is also [archaeological evidence of 16th century bras and pants](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/9410358/Austria-finds-15th-century-bras.html), though it's unclear how prevalent these things were. What is known is that, in the 18th century, there was a general sentiment that women's nether bits ought to be aerated to ensure that no nasty things could grow. This meant that there would be gaps in the underpants that were worn to allow for this ventilation. In this context, and given that a thong does present the opportunity for this ventilation, I find it not unreasonable to believe that a thong might adhere to 18th  century ideas of women's hygiene.\n\nWhat about moral codes, though? Once again, women were wearing crotchless pants at the time (as the poster said), though at this point we start seeing the addition of buttonable flaps, implying that women did indeed care about covering up. However, I do think I agree that wandering around in nothing but a thong might be considered scandalous...until you compare it to a [menstrual belt](http://www.mum.org/beltclass.jpg). This thing was worn during a woman's period to help be absorbent, and while that particular model is from the 1940s, it's possible that they were worn earlier. That said, the most common solution until about the 19th century was to not wear anything at all to deal with menstruation.\n\nWhat I think is the more interesting (more interesting than the history of menstruation? Fie the thought!) bad history, though, is this line:\n\n&gt; I imagine it would be pretty difficult to explain the usefulness...\n\n\"Usefulness\" is an interesting word to use. It implies that 18th century people would only be interested in something if it is useful, which is stupidly wrong. As [this article](http://www.jstor.org/stable/27676048?seq=1&amp;uid=3738392&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21104442193961) by Matt Erlin explains, consumer culture in Europe, at least, dates back to the 17th century at least. Hell, the import of exotic spices and tobacco from European colonies can be seen as one example of useless (not all spices are useless, I know) things still being attractive and desirable. Really, there's no better example of useless things than toys. Every society has and had toys, despite the fact that they have as much usefulness as a thong. Can you hunt with a toy? No. Can you build a house with a toy? No. CLEARLY USELESS. 18th century people, much like us, liked luxury goods and things that weren't eminently practical or spartan. They could indulge in a thong or two, I'm sure, and I'm sure they could appreciate someone wearing one.\n\nLet's move on to [this comment](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2kidis/what_invention_of_the_last_50_years_would_least/cllm5fm), shall we?\n\n&gt; The power shower. Most people those days thought soaking yourself in hot water would allow disease to enter the body.... That or deodorant- everybody probably stank like a goat's festering ass anyway so the more the merrier for them.\n\nAnd [this related one](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2kidis/what_invention_of_the_last_50_years_would_least/cllqm91)\n\n&gt; The pilgrims were the stinkiest motherfuckers on the planet. Never washed, always wore thick clothing regardless of weather and rarely washed that. Not to mention they had been on a boat for weeks all cramped together and probably covered with a fair amount of moss.\n\nOnce again, I cry Eurocentrism! It's almost a chant at this point. I can point to a post and you can pretty much guess that I'll call out the Eurocentrism. Islamic societies, for instance, have always been very careful about hygiene due to religious law. The first deodorant in Europe was introduced by Muslims in Spain. Beyond this, bathing is important in Hinduism due to the importance of ritual cleanliness. Native Americans in Virginia [bathed daily](http://encyclopediavirginia.org/Hygiene_During_the_Pre-Colonial_Era_Personal). [This article](https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/monumenta_nipponica/v060/60.1butler.pdf) by Lee Butler goes into great detail about the long and illustrious history of bathing in Japan, and their tendency to take scalding baths. \n\nOnce again, though, what about Europeans? They do seem to be the focus of this \"historical\" discussion. It's worth noting that by the Regency Period (the early 19th century), the homes of wealthy and noble British people had tubs for bathing in. The idea of bathing wasn't a new one in the 18th century, and it definitely wasn't coupled with the idea that bathing was terrible. Granted, public baths were seen as sinful, and there was a general notion that there was a risk with bathing (at least in northern Europe - not as much in the south), but smelling nice wasn't novel. Outside England, soaps had been in production in Europe since the 15th century, and became thoroughly industrialised in 1780 with James Keir's soap manufactory outside Tipton. All of this implies there was a rather heavy demand for soap and for smelling nice. In addition to this, perfumes and scented oils were widespread, further implying that yes, people in the 18th century did have a sense of smell, and yes, they did care about what they and others smelled like. Also, the Pilgrims were in the 17th century, not the 18th, so they can't be included in the AskReddit post anyway. \n\n[Moving on!](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2kidis/what_invention_of_the_last_50_years_would_least/clllsvw)\n\n&gt; Least impressive: that fan in the toilet seat,\nMost impressive: I am torn between indoor plumbing and sliced bread.\n\nThere's a fan in toilet seats? What sort of pleb am I that I have been sitting on a non-aerated toilet seat? Well, going off the previous comment, if it improves the smell of a toilet, I'm sure they'd be impressed.\n\nBut let's look at indoor plumbing and sliced bread. Plumbing and water control generally is as old as civilisation itself. An example of this can be found in flush toilets. The world's oldest flush toilets are from a village in Britain in the 31st century BCE, and cities in the Indus Valley civilisation in the 2nd millennium BCE had a flush toilet with water in every house. The Minoan capital of Knossos had an intricate system of pipes for removing waste water and bringing in fresh water (these were also used for toilets). Romans loved toilets and used them until the 5th century. However, as with many Roman things, the technology fell into disuse. Even the Maya had flush toilets and water filters. In the 16th century, though, Sir John Harington invented a precursor to the modern flush toilet. It didn't gain popularity in England, though it did in France. The toilet wouldn't become popular in England until the 18th century when it was coupled with burgeoning public water systems. The first modern toilet was patented in 1778, and gained popularity throughout the 19th century. Indoor plumbing isn't anywhere near as old as the commenter thinks it is, and while I think people would be impressed with it, I don't think it would necessarily be as impressive as the commenter believes.\n\nBut sliced bread? Sliced bread was invented in the 1920s, and was immensely popular. It was so popular, in fact, that the US government issued [a ban on sliced bread in 1943](http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2010/11/pre-sliced-bread-was-once-banned-in-the-united-states/) in the interest of preserving resources. Part of the appeal was that it could be eaten so much more quickly and efficiently that it could be used more and more often, and in a variety of situations. I'll agree with the commenter - 18th century people would love pre-sliced bread.\n\nThen there's [this comment](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2kidis/what_invention_of_the_last_50_years_would_least/cllr66w):\n\n&gt; Oh no. People don't realize how good we have it nowadays with alcohol.\nTo a 1700er used to foul-tasting lumpy sludge, brewed with bugs and dirt in dirty equipment, at a time before refrigeration systems, with around 1% alcohol... to them a bud light might just be the best thing they would have ever tasted.\n\nWut. Ain't no one going to think a Bud Light is the best thing they've ever tasted. The commenter does add an edit, though:\n\n&gt; EDIT: Because I'm getting so many replies from peopl who feel like I'm offending Weihenstephan or something. I'm specifically referring to small beer, which is the kind of stuff common people actually drank. Monasteries certainly made awesome beer since the middle ages, but it had little to do with the cheap stuff that people would drink liters of everyday.\n\nI'm still baffled at the Bud Light thing. Anywho, let's look at [small beer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_beer), this apparent beer of the common people. We will once again ignore that there is a huge variety of brewing techniques and products around the world (I'm personally a big fan of the theory that we have civilisation because of a desire to make alcohol better), and instead focus - as the commenter does - on the history of European alcohol. It's first worth noting that, contrary to the poster's expectations, this beer was not \"1% alcohol.\" As the Wikipedia article states, these things could be up to 9.5% alcohol, which isn't half-bad. However, it's important to note that small beer was primarily popular during the Middle Ages. After that, new distillation techniques were introduced via the Arabs, and alcohol changed dramatically. Whiskey was first recorded in Ireland in the 15th century, for instance, and was a hit both with kings and paupers alike. The world's oldest whiskey distillery still in operation dates back to the 17th century. During the 18th century, when the Acts of Union raised taxes on whiskey, the population of Scotland took to secretly distilling whiskey at night, creating moonshine. Whiskey was used as currency during the American Revolution and was introduced by sailors (those lowly common peasants) to India in the 19th century. In short, 18th century people would not be impressed by Bud Light. Not at all.\n\n^^^oh ^^^god ^^^there's ^^^more [THIS POST!](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2kidis/what_invention_of_the_last_50_years_would_least/cllnx5f)\n\n&gt; Civil rights. People weren't crazy about others of different social classes, religions, nations, races and creeds.\n\n...seriously? The end of the 18th century saw an explosion of centuries of philosophical musings on the rights of people and what it is to be a human being come into political reality. Descartes' *Discourse on Method* touches on the rights and duty of human beings in 1637. Plato wrote about this in *The Republic* in 380 BCE. Hell, the American Revolution was itself an exercise in the ability of people to demonstrate their own civil and human rights. In 1789, you have the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the French Revolution. \n\nDude, I think the 18th century people would *love* to see what happened with civil and political rights.\n\nFinally, [this](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2kidis/what_invention_of_the_last_50_years_would_least/cllrqy1)\n\n&gt; Ankle socks. In a time when showing ankles was dirty, my guess is it would seem slutty to wear clothes that stop at what must be covered up.\n\nSkipping over the Eurocentrism because I don't think I need to tell you that not everyone everywhere thought ankles were bad. Also, I'm not commenting on the radical idea that I could wear an ankle length skirt with my ankle socks. No, I'd like to talk about the idea of ankles being sinful. Much of what I found about this was that it's traced back to the Victorians (or at least attributed to them). However, unless someone knows something I don't, the Victorians didn't actually think ankles were sinful. The closest I can find is [the Adelaide boot](http://www.batashoemuseum.ca/podcasts/200901/), a style of shoe that became popular in the 1850s because it helped fill out a dress by covering a woman's ankle. It was necessary to cover ankles not because of sexual mores, but so that one's dress wouldn't look stupid. Personally, I think ankle socks would go great with them.\n\n^^^^never ^^^^again\n\nSources: \n\n\"Chairs: A History\" by Florence de Dampierre\n\n\"Food in History\" by Reay Tannahill\n\n\"1491\" by Charles Mann\n\n[This article about 18th century German consumer culture](http://www.jstor.org/stable/27676048?seq=1&amp;uid=3738392&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21104442193961) \n\n[This article about Japanese hygiene](https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/monumenta_nipponica/v060/60.1butler.pdf)\n\nEDIT: I just noticed that the AskReddit thread title asks about inventions of the last 50 years.

See Islam is only about 1400 years old, so it would be a neat trick for them to be fighting before that.\n\nOf course there is a bigger problem with this statement, our poster is referring not to Jews and Muslims, but rather Israelis and Muslims. Being extremely pedantic we could point out that the modern state of Israel didn't come into being until 1948, but let's acknowledge that conflict between Zionists and Muslims predates the foundation of Israel. The first major waves of modern Zionist settlement in the area we now call Israel began in the late 1800s (in response to antisemitism in Europe), this did indeed gradually grow into a conflict between the new settlers and the Muslims living in the area. Thus the conflict might be around 130 years old depending on how you want to count. Far shorter than \"a few thousand years.\"\n\nBut wait, you say, his ambiguous grammar suggests that he might be talking about conflicts between Muslims, not just between Muslims and Israelis. Well that still has the same problem that their conflicts are not \"a few thousand years old\" by definition.\n\nBut there is the broader problem with that statement, the Middle East (to the extent that we can use such an amorphous term) is not actually more violent than the rest of the world. The area was dominated between the 1500s and the early 1900s by the Ottomans. While there was certainly some conflict during that time period, is anyone going to seriously argue that it was more violent than the series of wars fought in Europe? Or than the violent expansionist policies of European leaders during much of that time period?\n\nIn the post-Ottoman time period, there has certainly been instability and unrest. Frankly I don't feel qualified to say if that instability and unrest is greater than that which has happened in other regions of the world, such as in Sub-Saharan Africa, Central Asia or South East Asia. I will say it kinda feels like cheating to compare the Middle East to Europe, considering that Europe has only really been at peace since they finished fighting the most destructive wars in history against each other, and now can't fight because the great powers have weapons that could be used to annihilate each other if war ever happened.\n\nMostly though I object to the ideas behind this bad history, which is that there can never be peace and stability in the Middle East, because it has always been in conflict. That just isn't true. The region is currently facing major stability issues and it's likely that we will see a lot more conflict in the area before things settle down. But it just isn't historically correct to suggest that somehow the Middle East is hardwired for war. ",

English was definitely alive and well in 1014. It was Old English, rather than the form that we know, but it was still English. In fact English made an appearance on the scene by at least 450 C.E., possibly earlier. This earliest version of Old English is mostly reconstructed, as we don't have any written English until the 7th century C.E.\n\nAbout that time we get a handful of documents written in various dialects of Old English. The poet Caedmon lived in the mid to late 7th century, which is when he wrote *Caedmon's Hymn*, the earliest surviving piece of English literature. There are some inscriptions which *might* be older. \n\nAldhelm (a good Anglo-Saxon name if there ever was one) lived from 639 to 709 and was a prolific writer as well as being the Abbot of Malmesbury Abbey, and the Bishop of Sherborne. Aldhelm also introduced the Benedictine orders to England. \n\nBede makes an appearance in the 7th century (born 672/673, died 735). His work *An Ecclesiastical History of the English People* is his best known work and was completed in 731. \n\nThe poet *Cynewulf* has several surviving works, but little is known about the poet himself. He may have lived as early as the late 8th century, or as late as the early 10th century. \n\nDuring this period Old English was heavily influenced by Norse invaders, who settled and intermarried with the locals. This influence changed the grammar and structure of the language dramatically. There's some evidence that Celtic peoples also influenced the grammar of English, specifically with the meaningless \"do\" (as in \"Do you want to eat\"?) However this claim is not accepted by all linguists.\n\nThen along comes the Norman invasion of England in 1066, and this changed English even *more* dramatically. The Normans brought their own version of French with them, and English picked up much in the way of vocabulary from the Normans. English also picked up grammar changes. For a period of a couple of centuries England was essentially a tri-lingual country^1. French was spoken at court and in legal matters. English was spoken at home and on the street (and in business), and Latin in the church. You can see this in the literature of the time. There's surviving poems written in all three languages. Chaucer wrote English, but he used French meter and style.\n\nBy the 13th century English had begun to be written again as the primary language. The first English government document was the Provisions of Oxford, written in 1258. Edward III addressed Parliament in English in 1362--the first English king since William to do so. During Henry V's campaign in France in 1415 he wrote home progress reports in English, another first. \n\nAbout this time the switch to Middle English began. Middle English grew out of the [Chauncery English](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_English#Chancery_Standard) used by the court in London. William Caxton brings the printing press to England in 1476 and he uses Chauncery English in his works, spreading the popularity of English even further. (He's the first one who published Mallory's *Le Morte de Arthur* in English.) There's also the [Great Vowel Shift](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Vowel_Shift) and the publications of the printer Richard Pynson (started printing in 1491). \n\nTyndale published his translation of the Bible in 1525 (and died for it), but in 1539 an official Bible was published. Both Tyndale's Bible (incomplete as it was), and the 1539 Bible (sometimes called the Great Bible because of it's size) were extremely popular, helping to spread a standard dialect of English.^2\n\nShakespeare comes along in the late 16th, early 17th centuries. The first English dictionary was published in 1609. By this point we've got a language that's clearly Early Modern English, even if it uses some unfamiliar words and grammar. \n\nSo the statement \" . . .the millennium that English has existed\" is wrong two ways. English (as descended from Old English) is *at least* 1400 years old. If we're counting just Modern English, then it's 400-450 years old. \n\nThis is just a brief overview, and will probably contain some errors. Feel free to nitpick my nitpick. \n\n1.) Source: Michael C. Drout \"The History of the English Language\" lecture series available via The Modern Scholar.\n\n2.) There's a joke in one of Chaucer's writings where he has someone from London travelling north. The traveler stops at an inn to ask for some eggs and the inkkeper doesn't understand what he wants because the dialects are so different. \n\nSources: \n\n* Michael C.

        "text": "Forgive me, Volcano, for my OMC quoting. It got stuck in my head, and I just had to indulge myself.\n\nToday's bizarrity comes to us from /r/PropagandaPosters, which [discusses why North Korea is the way it is](http://np.reddit.com/r/PropagandaPosters/comments/2knsfe/all_the_people_of_the_world_praising_kim_il_sung/clnlsh4?context=1). /u/cassander thinks that it's all Kim Il-Sung's fault, while /u/eyeball_kid takes the position that it's a combination of the Korean War and the threat of US nuclear intervention as well as the influence of natural disasters that made North Korea what it is today. They're both right, but they're both wrong. The political history of North Korea is a bit more intricate than that, though they're both right in that their chosen causes do play important roles. I won't be able to go into this as much as I'd like because of rule 2, but I can, at least, talk about Kim Il-Sung.\n\nBefore we get to Kim Il-Sung, though, let's take a ride in the wayback machine to 1945 and the end of WWII. The Allies had defeated Japan, and Korea was liberated from Japanese rule. According to the [Cairo Declaration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo_Declaration) of 1943, this was meant to create a free and independent Korea. However, due to geopolitical tensions between the US and the Soviet Union, Korea wasn't just left to do its own thing. Rather, the peninsula was divided along the 38th parallel, with the Soviet Union controlling the north and the US controlling the South. The Koreans, predictably enough, were not happy about this. Each half saw itself as the rightful government of the entirety of Korea and sought the \"liberation\" of the other half. In 1948, the two governments of North and South Korea were officially established. In May of that year, [Syngman Rhee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syngman_Rhee) was elected as the first president of South Korea, while in September, Kim Il-Sung was installed as the premier of North Korea.\n\nSo who is Kim Il-Sung? To understand North Korea, it is necessary to understand the Kims and their system of *juche*. Kim Il-Sung's life story is a contested affair. Much of what is known comes either from his own writings or from potentially biased witnesses. What is known, however, is that his family probably participated in anti-Japanese activities in response to the Japanese occupation of Korea. To what extent and from where his resistance occurred, it's unclear. However, it is known that his family fled to Manchuria where he learned Chinese, and his family may have continued resistance activities. In 1931, Kim joined the Communist Party of China. He participated in an armed uprising in Manchuria which ultimately led to the Japanese having a greater hold on the region. He continued to participate in guerilla activities against the Japanese, becoming seen as one of the primary Korean leaders. However, after being defeated by the Japanese in 1940, he fled to the Soviet Union, serving in the Red Army. When Stalin requested a Communist-friendly leader for Korea, his advisors recommended Kim Il-Sung. He was installed in 1945. The Soviet Union considered the Northern government to be the official government of Korea. The US disagreed. By 1949, North Korea was a totalitarian state, and the personality cult of Kim Il-Sung was coming into being. \n\nLet's look at this personality cult, though. While it would be more solidified and consolidated after the Korean War - the North Korean constitution wouldn't officially make Kim Il-Sung's ideas the guiding principle of the state until 1972, for example - its beginnings were there before the war. Understanding why Kim Il-Sung was literally deified, though, is a bit more complicated than saying \"people are gullible, yo.\" The occupation of Korea - and the enslavement of some of its people and the suppression of Korean culture - left a huge mark on Korea. Kim Il-Sung was presented as a great liberator of Korea, in some stories single-handedly throwing the Japanese from Korea. While this may seem ridiculous to us, when coupled with both the propaganda machine that went to work after the Korean War and the rapid rebuilding of North Korea, it seemed less implausible. Given that for a time, life was actually better in the North than in the South, it seemed entirely possible that Kim Il-Sung could be a miracle worker. \n\nIt's also well-worth noting the Confucian influence on Korean society, and the means by which Kim Il-Sung co-opted this. Confucian doctrines are patriarchal, and focus on loyalty and devotion to the father. Kim Il-Sung, as part of his cult of personality, presented himself as the father of the nation, liberating and preserving it from oppressors, and caring for the Korean people as his own children. In a context of traditional Confucianism, this father imagery would have been very powerful, and would have engendered loyalty. Besides this, people honestly *liked* Kim Il-Sung. Their standard of living was fairly high, there was universal healthcare, employment, and education, and their needs were more or less tended to (as long as you don't consider political participation a need). There were logical enough reasons to be happy with the government, and people were.\n\nTo be very clear, this is not to say that veneration of leaders is the guaranteed outcome of a situation like North Korea's. South Korea provides an example of a country that had similar circumstances but no cult of personality (indeed, Syngman Rhee died in exile in Honolulu). What I am saying, though, is that the veneration of the Kims is the result of a combination of Japanese occupation and its consequences for Korea as well as carefully calculated political ploys by Kim Il-Sung and his propagandists. The cult was set up to make it a crime not to venerate Kim Il-Sung, and this undoubtedly played a role in his becoming popular. However, it also can't be discounted that the situation in North Korea was such that a personality cult like Kim Il-Sung's could arise while it would fail in the Soviet Union. \n\nKim Jong-Il inherited this personality cult, becoming engrained in it as the son of a god (and thus a god in and of himself). However, he too was savvy about manipulating it to his own advantage and creating something that he could use while not disturbing the image of his father as a god. I'd say more, but I suspect a thorough discussion of Kim Jong-Il's use of the personality cult would violate rule 2. Suffice to say, then, that part of why North Korea is the way it is is because of this personality cult and its ability to withstand a great deal of pressure.\n\nThere is more to consider, though. Why, for instance, is North Korea still around and still so resolutely...North Korea in the 21st century? Once again, I'm not going to cross rule 2, but to understand this, we can look at Kim Il-Sung's particular brand of communism, namely *juche.* This particular form of communism focused on self-reliance and North Korea being able to be self-sufficient, with all production and agriculture being done within the country. Until the 1960s, North Korea accepted development aid from China and the Soviet Union, using them to build up its own economy in preparation for its self-reliance and to recover from the Korean War. During this time, the economy of North Korea boomed - to the extent that North Korea was seen as the more prosperous and miraculous country of the two Koreas and Koreans from Japan immigrated to the country - and industry grew. However, after the policy of *juche* was implemented, the economy stagnated, and after the fall of the Soviet Union, it collapsed entirely. North Korea, whether it wanted to be or not, was reliant on cheap energy and resources from outside Korea, and when the Cold War ended, this aid stopped. Once again, I'd be crossing rule 2 if I really went into the implications of the end of the Cold War, but I'll let [this chart](http://s17.postimg.org/e9bj08wwf/NK_Refugee_Stats.jpg) speak for itself. \n\nBut the question still remains. Why is North Korea the way that it is when South Korea is radically different? Well, as I think I've made clear, the fact that North Korea was able to receive aid and supplies from other Communist nations - including Yugoslavia and East Germany - means that it was able to continue the story of prosperity even when that was clearly not the case. Its people, too, bought into this idea of prosperity and the idea of the personality cult surrounding the Kims, meaning there wasn't the same political unrest that could be found in the Soviet Union or other parts of the Soviet bloc. Kim Il-Sung's willingness to play both sides of the Sino-Soviet Conflict, too, meant that he was able to switch when necessary and receive more aid than he might have otherwise. His occasional perceived cooperation with the UN or South Korea (especially during the [Sunshine Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Policy)) meant that North Korea was not interfered with as much as might have been the case in a less cooperative nation. The DMZ with South Korea, too, meant that any hostility towards the North would have been met with even more hostility and another brutal and bloody war.\n\nBecause of all these factors, North Korea was able to maintain its isolation and its personality cult, even in the face of intense external and internal pressures. The main difference between what happened with South Korea and what happened with North Korea, I'd argue, lies in the countries that occupied them nearly 70 years ago and determined what the future would be. In South Korea, there were democratic elections, and while the democratically-elected president was a bit of a tyrant, the fact that there was an election at all meant that the precedent for political freedoms had been set, and would continue to be exercised. In North Korea, there was an installed ruler and a carefully cultivated propaganda machine bent on keeping him in power. I'd argue that it's because of these differences in the initial founding of the countries that North Korea and South Korea are what they are. It isn't just the circumstances of the Korean War and the topography of the Korean peninsula - though, at least in the case of post-Cold War politics, that's certainly played a role - and it isn't just Kim Il-Sung. Rather, it's the influence of the US and the Soviet Union in crafting the Korea they wanted that helped create these two very different countries. Kim Il-Sung just happened to be the perfect choice to maintain it.",

Wanting to play the devil’s advocate, and because I like to be an evil douche sometimes, I decided to go with defending Stalin against either false imprisonment, or murder. As luck would have it, I ended up with the charge of false imprisonment (for which Comrade St5alin was found guilty, although the jury took a different approach for their verdict which was kind of lame. Y U NO MENTION MY YEZHOV SCAPEGOATING? I tried to make it clear during the verdict that I was referring to Yezhov specifically and not “Trotskyite infiltration,” but eh. Hope they don’t think I’m some sort of apologist for my clarification now…). Other charges covered during the trial included: famine/starvation (found not guilty), treaty violations/war of aggression (found not guilty, possibly because the prosecution failed to mention Poland), deportation/mass rape (not guilty), mass execution/genocide/capital murder (guilty), and forced labor/enslavement (surprisingly, found not guilty).\n\n[The transcript of my speech can be found here]( http://pastebin.com/FvWM98Ky) \n\n[and there were these “Moscow Times” articles—I just substituted some names so have a read if you like]( http://pastebin.com/3M8sAQW5) \n\nAlso, if anyone wants to have some fun debunking some Stalinist bad history, [this is the site where I got some of my material from]( http://espressostalinist.com/).

I won’t talk too much about the prosecution, but if you’re interested in what went down, I talk a little about it [here]( http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2iqacn/thoughts_for_thursday_09_october_2014/cl5euol) and [here]( http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2k306q/thoughts_for_thursday_23_october_2014/cli42af). \n\nI look up the prosecution’s sources and notice that their chief source for the purges uses the numbers proposed by [Steven G. Wheatcroft]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_G._Wheatcroft), as opposed to another frequently cited historian: [Robert Conquest]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Conquest). Here  is how [J. Arch Getty]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Arch_Getty) sums up the difference between Wheatcroft and Conquest in [“Victims of the Soviet Penal System in the Pre-War Years: A First Approach on the Basis of Archival Evidence”](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2166597) \n\n&gt; Debate in the West about the precise numbers of victims has appeared in the\nscholarly press for several years and has been characterized by wide disparity,\noften of several millions, between high and low estimates. Using census and other\ndata, scholars have put forward conflicting computations of birth, mortality, and\narrests in order to calculate levels of famine deaths due to agricultural collectivization\n(1932-1933), victims of the Great Terror (1936-1939), and total \"unnatural\"\npopulation loss in the Stalin period. Anton Antonov-Ovseenko, **Robert\nConquest, Steven Rosefielde, and others have posited relatively high estimates**\n(see Table 1).2 On the other hand, **Stephen Wheatcroft and others working from the same sources have put forth lower totals.**3 Both \"high\" and \"low\" estimators\nhave bemoaned the lack of solid archival evidence and have claimed that should\nsuch materials become available, they would confirm the author's projection. The\ndebate, along with disputes on the \"totalitarian\" nature of the Stalinist regime, the\nimportance of Joseph Stalin's personality, and the place of social history in Soviet\nstudies, has polarized the field into two main camps, perhaps unfortunately\nlabeled \"Cold Warriors\" and \"revisionists.\"4 **Revisionists have accused the other\nside of using second-hand sources and presenting figures that are impossible to\njustify, while the proponents of high estimates have criticized revisionists for\nrefusing to accept grisly facts and even for defending Stalin.** Both sides have\naccused the other of sloppy or incompetent scholarship.\n\nFrom there, Getty  goes on to say that with the ending of the Soviet era and the Cold War, actual NKVD records have been released etc. \n\nSo being in my Stalinist mindset I’m both glad that the prosecution did not use Conquest, and disappointed since that would mean that I’d be unable to throw some Wheatcroft and Getty at them to refute his claims and mentioning that Conquest’s numbers were exaggerated. \n\nThen the question for me was: how do I justify the purges? I decided to answer that question by saying that Stalin was shaped by the historical circumstances that were around him, and that Nikolai Yezhov, the troikas, and everyone else was responsible for the mass arrests—and not Stalin. I also decided to throw some false equivalence in there by pointing to McCarthyism, and threw Japanese-American internment in there as a double standard. \n\nSo let’s get started. \n\n&gt; A few minutes ago, Comrade Lenin said in his opening statement that the prosecution decontextualized Comrade Stalin by ignoring what was happening in the world around him. History does not occur in a vacuum, and we cannot look at individual parts without looking at the whole. History is not just about “great men,” nor is it about those who do “good” and those who do “bad.”  History is filled with millions of players, each with their own thoughts and goals influencing their decisions which have implications for how other players react to those actions as well. The prosecution, unfortunately, has divorced Stalin from history, robbing him of any and all historical context that could otherwise explain his behavior. The prosecution has separated Comrade Stalin from history, and put him on a pedestal so that they might fling accusations at him all the while ignoring the things that were going around Comrade Stalin that made him act in that way.\n\n“I mean—~~Hitler~~ Stalin really wasn’t *that* bad. You’re just being a typical fascist-sympathizing bourgeois capitalist if you think Stalin was ‘bad’ or if you think he did anything wrong.  \n\n&gt; …[Document 1]( http://i.imgur.com/0noFTMY.jpg) of the packet that was just given to you shows a map of Europe in the year 1935. At this time, the USSR was the only communist nation in the world—a lone island of communism lost in a sea of capitalist states. Because they were the only communist nation in the world, Stalin had to create a strong state that was intolerant to outliers. Thus, the Communist Party was forced to attack any and all known opponents in order to maintain a strong, stable state that would be unable to collapse. Had deviance from Stalinist thought been allowed, the Soviet state might have failed. However, this occasionally went too far, and excesses resulted from the repression of the opposition.  \n\nYeah so apparently the threat of collapse, and suspicions of reactionary tendencies  justifies imprisoning  people by the thousands? Our guy handling the mass murder charge brought up a similar point—and it only really makes sense if you consider the Stalinist viewpoint. I mean, Stalin had quotas for his arrests. I don’t think you can justify Stalin’s actions by saying “he was fearful of Western aggression and hostility” when the guy had arrest quotas which essentially was a control measure. Not to mention he knew how to pit people against each other, and he knew how to use that to control everything around him.\n\nI think a good counter question might be to ask if this meant that we in the defense thought the Germans were aggressive because they were a lone fascist state etc., to which we would have replied with: no. But then we’d probably just end up calling the prosecution fascist sympathizers since they seemed to be siding with the Nazis on a lot of issues in their prosecution. \n\n&gt; As to why repression was thought to be necessary by Comrade Stalin and the Communist Party, the answer is obvious: the Russians were afraid because they were surrounded by potentially hostile nations. If you look at [Document 2]( http://pastebin.com/nnmYjXxx) of the packet, you’ll see a brief list of quotes…\n\nI literally just googled anti-communism and anti-USSR quotes and put them on a word document page. Anyway, I think you can argue here that I’m decontextualizing things myself by mentioning all these quotes despite saying I wanted to add context to everything. Furthermore, Ronald Suny, in [“The Soviet Experiment: Russia, the USSR, and the Successor States”](http://www.amazon.com/The-Soviet-Experiment-Russia-Successor/dp/0195340558) discusses how tension was building up between the US and USSR between the end of WWII and the beginning of the Cold War which might help explain some of the quotes at least, although In don’t know how you can explain the Churchill quotes. Could this hostility be explained by looking at the actions of the Bolsheviks during the Russian revolution of 1917 and the Russian Civil War? From what I understand, the Bolsheviks never had a majority during the elections and they essentially led a coup against Kerensky. \n\n&gt; …the hostility of the West created paranoia among the Russians, and the Purges are proof of that. Although it certainly was a great tragedy, it ought to be remembered that there usually was a reason why someone was accused in the first place. \n\nI’m not sure of a good counter-argument for that, but I’d call “there usually was a reason why someone was accused in the first place” a rather dubious claim. \n\n&gt; Occasionally, excesses were caused by local officials, and by ordinary individuals who sought revenge on local officials by sending accusations their way as well. Even the prosecution’s source mentions the role played by local officials who participated in the leftist excesses of the Purges. In fact, a look at [Document 3](http://i.imgur.com/bMqAs2l.png?1) will reveal the large percentage of individuals who were freed after being sent to the Gulags even before 1953. A look at [Document 4](http://i.imgur.com/ETKIzH6.png?1) also reveals that between 1934 and 1937, the majority of Gulag sentencing was carried out by the troikas—not by Stalin, not by the NKVD. It is only in 1939 and 1940 where we see the NKVD where we see the NKVD delivering the majority of sentences.\n\nYeah so—I had to be really careful how I worded this knowing that. When asked to clarify the troika-NKVD hierarchy, I decided to go with:\n\n&gt; Troikas were nods to local authority as they were given carte blanche to do what they want without thinking about laws. And as I mentioned, most of the sentencing was done by the Troikas, which again fed into this cycle of repression and paranoia. They were linked to the NKVD which was then controlled by Yezhov.\n\nMmm, Stalin apologia. I’ll get into Yezhov later, but: \n\n1. I oversimplified a bit by saying the troikas were linked to the NKVD. They were actually under the Cheka at first. \n2. Stalin really loved to use purges and scapegoats as a way to have control over the state. He would keep some of his potential enemies around so he could use them as a scapegoat should something happen. In a few instances during collectivization, he’d stop collectivization measures and blame everything on local authorities despite all decisions taking place at the top. When factors failed, he’d blame saboteurs and the “bourgeois experts.” \n3. Also I realized I derped and said that the NKVD did not control the troikas when they did. I should have said they were controlled by the NKVD and just gone on to blame Yezhov.\n4. The members of the troikas were picked by the NKVD, which was ultimately controlled by—you guessed it—JOSEPH STALIN!\n\nIn terms of the charge regarding murder—one of our judges actually emailed Suny, who said Stalin ultimately was in charge, so I’m not too sure why they didn’t apply this here as well, because I think my whole case relies on Yezhov being the cause of all this.\n\n &gt; Leftist excesses were created by fear of potential hostility from the West and the chief organ that was responsible for these excesses was the NKVD itself. The NKVD had been slowly gaining more and more power, becoming far too independent and uncontrollable by our Vozhd. Men like Nikolai Yezhov fed fear into the minds of the Russian people, as well as the mind of Comrade Stalin himself, creating a reoccurring cycle of fear, hostility, and repression. [Document 5]( http://i.imgur.com/NvDTMqn.png?1) and [Document6]( http://i.imgur.com/AyfKvtZ.png?1) feature some paragraphs that demonstrate this man’s role in the Purges. Document 7 is a transcript from a speech given by Comrade Yezhov in September 1935 that demonstrates how he fed fear into the hearts and minds of the Russians. If Stalin saw spies everywhere, it was only because of Comrade Yezhov.\n\nThis was really tricky because I had to somehow blame Yezhov without outright saying Stalin ultimately had control over the NKVD (which he did). I ended up [emailing the judges some “evidence” to support this]( http://i.imgur.com/ychCV7N.png?1), but it was really weak evidence.  There was the primary source document of Yezhov;s resignation or something, but I felt that it might be condemning to Stalin (especially since Yezhov was purged because he [supposedly did not purge enough people]( http://books.google.com/books?id=__j_n3eGp-AC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=document%20191&amp;f=false), and as a temporary Stalinist I could not allow that to happen.\n\nAnyway, let me see if I remember enough from “The Soviet Experiment” and some of the articles I had read to unpack all the bad history I just spewed.\n\n&gt; Leftist excesses were created by fear of potential hostility from the West\n\nThe fear of hostility…that was created by the Stalinist propaganda machine? \n\n&gt; The NKVD had been slowly gaining more and more power, becoming far too independent and uncontrollable by our Vozhd.\n\nAs far as I know, the opposite is actually true. Or rather, the NKVD looked like it was gaining too much power so the Central Committee had to rein it in. This is one reason why I had to be very careful of what I said since admitting that the CC had to rein in the NKVD in might mean admitting that Stalin held ultimate power over the NKVD.\n \n\n[**Continued**](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2kuh9h/adventures_in_stalinism_or_that_one_time_i_became/clotbit) ",

They look at all sides of the issues, and then look at what might be the most reasonable explanation for the issues. Sure, looking at all sides of the issues can only be encouraged, but 'look at all sides of the issues, and then completely ignore decades of historic research\" is simply delusional.\n\n&gt;allies bombed supply lines and cities\n\nYes. Also has nothing to do with the Holocaust. Maybe he meant to say that allies never bombed the railroads leading to Auschwitz, some people here have already explained that'd just be horribly inefficient since they'd just be rebuilt immediatly anyway. Perhaps that's what the OP meant by this comment.\n\n&gt; you think prisoners had plenty of food in the final days of the war prior to being liberated? or that germans starved people that they had in those camps for around 5 years \n\nHere's the thing, those 'prisoners' didn't die of starvation: they were gassed. Other than that, this really isn't an argument to make about the holocaust being a hoax.\n\n&gt; that's how horrible stuff happens to people there is dirt, torture and cruelty in every country's history\n\nBordering on genocide olympics here. Even though he is right to say a lot of countries have dirt in their history (I'm Belgian, *Leopold II*), it's again irrelevant here. The holocaust happening or not or being awful or not has nothing to do with the (past) behaviour of other countries, the reality of it happening stands on its own.\n\n&gt;depending on the results of wars\n\nHistory is *not* written by the victors. I can name Stalin as an example, or:\n\n&gt;110,000 japanese-americans were also kept in camps in the US, so don't think that country was somehow a savior\n\nNevermind, the OP just demonstrated it himself. The detainment of the Japanese-Americans is well-known (even though edgy redditors claim it isn't), and as far as I'm aware the US are back-to-back World War Champions.\n\n&gt;they'd be walking skeletons too if germany or japan invaded mainland US and won the war and all supply lines were destroyed during the final stages of the war\n\nI suppose he's implying all those people died because the allies invaded Europe (or, liberated the occupied countries) and dared to attack Germany. However, the [Final Solution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Solution), or Endlösung, was already formulated in 1942 at the Wannsee conference.\n\n&gt;what are disputed are claims that those camps were death camps and the numbers being thrown around are questioned\n\nThe numbers have been revised countless times by actual historical research. When these numbers are revised, holocaust deniers scream \"they're not even sure about their own numbers!!!! See!\". When *they* 'find' new numbers however, that's completely accurate and there's no reason to doubt their research whatsoever...\n\n&gt;hate speech labels like \"holocaust deniers\"\n\n*twitch*\n\n&gt;how it's illegal in certain areas to even investigate or suggest anything but the accepted version, even if it's completely professional\n\nHistorical research about the holocaust isn't illegal anywhere.

In this quote, Young attempts to discuss the origins of monogamy, which he viewed as an unnatural practice. \n\nIt starts out:\n&gt; Just ask yourselves, historians\n\nAlways an auspicious start\n\n&gt;When was monogamy introduced to the face of the earth?\n\nWell, that's actually a very interesting and complex question. There's quite a lot of debate in anthropological circles about whether monogamy is a biological sexual practice or a strictly cultural one, or some combination of the two. Perhaps Young will attempt to resolve this conflict with a series of well-researched-\n\n&gt;When those buccaneers who settled on the peninsula where Rome now stands\n\nWait, what?

However, to imply that A) these laws were passed without any preceding cultural practice of monogamy and B) that the laws were passed *solely* because there were not enough women to \"go around\" is, at best, entirely untrue. \n\n&gt;And this started monogamy and the downfall of the plurality system\n\nLike I said before, Rome was definitely not the first example of monogamy in human history, nor did polygamy cease to exist everywhere following the establishment of the Roman state.\n\n&gt;This was the rise, start, and foundation of the doctrine of monogamy\n\nExcept for the part where it wasn't.\n\n&gt; And never till then was a law passed, that we have any knowledge of, that a man should have but one wife.\n\nIf you define \"law\" in an extremely interesting way, there is a possibility that this is a true statement!

It's usually just for things undeserving of an r5, but it's good if you want to look around for a possible post), and I thought this was an excellent coincidence seeing how I spent 3 weeks or so making up some bullshit about Stalin doing nothing wrong and how the purges were all Yezhov's fault (More on that later, but let's just focus on this for the time being). \n\nAnyway, let's break this down:\n\n&gt; Less than 600 thousand people were executed under his 30 year rule, most of them happening during the purge\n\nOk so, there tend to be two schools in terms of calculating numbers--those with side Stephen Wheatcroft tend to estimate lower numbers, while those that Robert Conquest tend to estimate high numbers. Conquest gets accused of using a lot of anecdotes and and second-hand accounts tom inflate his numbers, but I wont get too much into that debate. I'm just going to to stuck with Arch Getty since that is who /r/askhistorians recommended \n\n(Granted, I'm still iffy about it despite Getty basing his numbers on Wheatcroft just because I'm seeing some websites that revere him as a sort of anti-Western imperialist bringer of truth, and I'm not sure if it's because of his political convictions, or because these people have only hard of Conquest.)\n\n[A few estimates reported by Getty](http://i.imgur.com/JETJnJ6.png?1)\n\nAnyway, that aside, Wiki reports that [at least 111,091 people](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Purge#National_operations_of_NKVD) were killed between 1937 and 1940 alone--by the NKVD. Nor do those numbers account for [all the mass graves in the USSR.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_graves_in_the_Soviet_Union)\n\n\n\n[And don't get me started on the prison populations](http://i.imgur.com/bMqAs2l.png?1)\n\nThe thing is, even if we accept the lower figures, the fact remains that Stalin killed thousands of his own people for no other reason other than their apparent treason, and many mire were imprisoned or exiled. Ronald Suny also discusses how he would frequently blame the local officials for the terror occurring during collectivization despite the orders coming from the Central Committee.\n\nAnyway, this now brings us to the second half of this comment:\n\n&gt; most of [the executions] happening during the purges which have been proven to be the work of Yezhov, not Stalin. Yezhov was he himself executed for concocting the purges.\n\nThis is bad in many ways: \n\n1. Yezhov was was Stalin's designated scapegoat during the start of the Great Purges.\n2. Yezhov headed the NKVD between 1936 and 1937, and he was killed in 1940. If everything was Yezhov'ds fault, [why is the Gulag population rising between the time he resigns as head of the NKVD, and 1941--the year after he dies?](http://i.imgur.com/bMqAs2l.png?1)\n3. Yes, Yezhov was killed for playing a role in the purges. But, and there's a big *but* here--he was executed [because he apparently failed to find the *\"*real*\" conspirators, and this was part of Stalin's style of repression]( http://books.google.com/books?id=__j_n3eGp-AC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=document%20191&amp;f=false) Stalin was the type of person who would pit people against each other, and he actually gave permission to slowly take power from Yezhov, until he was ultimately arrested and executed. \n4. It should be noted that that Yezhov was tortured and admitted to soying for the Germans, and other treadonous acts--the usual list of charges that those tortured would end up confessing to.\n5. Yes, Yezhov headed the NKVD, but Stalin is the one who ultimately controlled it.\n\nedit: I know my r5 is a bit lacking, but feel free to contribute some more r5 if you have anything ",

Today's article, on the virtues of marrying young, is one of the more reasonable articles I've seen by him, but there's still some pretty significant misrepresentation of marriage's role in human history that I'd like to point out.\n\n&gt; I was 24 when we met and got engaged and 25 when we tied the knot. That would make us pretty run of the mill by our grandparents’ standards, but not anymore. These days we’re practically a Ripley’s Believe It Or Not exhibit. People are downright befuddled to come across a 20-something with a wedding ring, much less a couple of carseats in the back of the sedan. \n\n[As of 2013, the average age for first marriages is 29/27 for men/women](http://nationalmarriageproject.org/resources/knot-yet-the-benefits-and-costs-of-delayed-marriage-in-america/), which is higher than it used to be but still in the 20s range; if I'm reading the charts right, approximately 45% of women aged 25-29 are or have been married (I don't see this statistic for men, unfortunately), making Mrs. Walsh much less of an outlier than the article implies. This isn't badhistory, but it does set a general tone as to the article's accuracy right from the start (I'll stick to historical inaccuracies from here on out).\n\n&gt;We are, without a doubt, the most marriage-averse group in human history. \n\nWell that didn't take long.\n\nModern America, the most marriage-averse society in history? If we can be bothered to remember that non-European people exist, there's the [Mosuo](http://www.mosuoproject.org/walking.htm), whose customary relationships don't fall under marriage at all (no cohabitation, no longterm commitment, no paternal responsibility towards children). But they're far away, so they don't count (/s); only Europeans are really part of history. And to be fair, if you define marriage broadly enough to accept any sort of committed relationship with societal recognition, it's pretty universal throughout European history, so there's not much else I can say...\n\n&gt;Certainly, live-in girlfriends and boyfriends are no replacement for the commitment, sacrifice, and profound love of a family joined together through the sacrament of marriage. \n\nNow we're talking! The idea of marriage as a loving monogamous relationship sealed by religious authority (the only real type of marriage, apparently), is not at all universal, even if you ignore all those silly foreigners. The Israelites were polygamous, the Babylonians auctioned off brides (at least according to Herodotus, but from what I can tell it's a fairly uncontested passage), but that's still the Middle East, not Europe. No, in post-Roman Europe, marriage was a sacred sacrament administered by the Church, as it rightfully should be - starting in 1563, when the Council of Trent stipulated that a bishop had to be present to make a marriage legitimate. Prior to that, a verbal pledge was sufficient, with only some places requiring witnesses. ([Wiki discusses, because I'm growing lazy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage#Europe)) If \"live-in boyfriends and girlfriends\" don't count, then at most we're the most marriage-averse post-1563 European society. (I'm skeptical of this claim too, but not strongly so, and don't know enough to refute it). Get it right, Walsh.",

        "text": "Oh, fine. The title might be a *bit* harsh. But then, [this article](http://io9.com/did-a-pope-and-an-emperor-team-up-to-erase-300-years-of-1651594813) is kind of silly too. The article is about the [Phantom Time Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_time_hypothesis), and rather than dismissing it outright, the article is actually presenting it as a valid historical hypothesis. Which is stupid.\n\nBut I'm getting ahead of myself. What is the Phantom Time Hypothesis? Well, much like the article says, it's the theory that the Holy Roman Emperor Otto III and Pope Sylvester II skipped three hundred years so that Otto could be crowned at the start of a new millennium, making him seem like he was a pretty awesome emperor. The three hundred years that were invented stretched between 614 CE and 911 CE. Everything in this stretch of time, the theory states, was invented. This includes such notable figures as Charlemagne, who the originator of this theory (one Herbert Illig) says is too much of an Arthurian figure to have been real. \n\nIllig presents some evidence for his theory. He argues that there is a distinct lack of archaeological evidence from this time period, and that the documentary evidence of the time period is flawed and forged. Illig also focuses on the [switch from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar](http://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/julian-gregorian-switch.html). This switch occurred in the 16th century because the Julian calendar didn't accurately reflect a year - the new calendar, with its introduction of leap years and a slower year, was more accurate (though it still adds a day every 3000 or so years). The Julian calendar, on the other hand, added an error day every 128 years, meaning that by the time the switch was implemented, several days had to be removed. What Illig focuses on in his theory is the number of days removed - for the countries making the change in the 16th century, there were ten days removed. \"Aha!\" but you and the linked article say. \"But the Julian calendar was implemented in 45 BCE! There should be more than ten days removed, seeing as there's more like 1500 years between 45 BCE and the 16th century! This is proof - PROOF, I TELLS YA! - of a conspiracy!\" \n\nThank you for the interjection, imaginary person. I always appreciate them. Academics refuting the Phantom Time Hypothesis have pointed out that the purpose of the calendar reform was never to bring the calendar in line with the original founding of the Julian calendar, but rather to bring it in line with the Council of Nicaea and its setting of the date of Easter. The Council of Nicaea was in 325 CE, much closer to the ten days removal. Ten days were removed not because three hundred years have been fabricated, but because those three hundred years weren't necessary to the calendar. There was a different starting point, and that starting point makes perfect sense for the calendar, and makes the number of days removed make sense. \n\nThere is other evidence to refute Illig's Phantom Time hypothesis. The most important of these is that, contrary to his assertions, there is archaeological evidence that the years from 614 to 911 CE existed. Trees, especially, provide very good evidence as their rings can show both the passage of time and known events in that time. \n\nIt's also well worth noting that other things happened in this span of time. Things like the founding of Islam in the 7th century are recorded in places outside Europe, and do seem to have happened at the time they are supposed to have occurred. Things like the [Battle of Talas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Talas) in 751 CE are recorded in Chinese records. It's unlikely the Chinese were in cahoots with Otto III about inventing an extra three hundred years, but hey, you never know. There are other historical events that are well-recorded throughout cultures as well. Halley's Comet, for instance, would have been seen - and indeed was seen and recorded - three times during this missing period of time. Its 684 appearance was recorded by both German and Chinese observers, and its 837 appearance was recorded in China, Japan, Germany, and the Middle East. Considering it was recorded both within the areas that would have been subjected to the extra three hundred years and those outside, it seems rather unlikely that they all were mistaken about seeing a comet. In short, there's no evidence to support the Phantom Time hypothesis other than one man's wishful thinking.\n\nDoes the linked article suggest this? Not really. It includes a line saying it's a \"controversial theory.\" This is like saying a flat earth is a \"controversial theory\" - if there's no debate whatsoever about it, it's rather difficult to say there's a controversy. Its last paragraph sort of says that this is unlikely, but it still ends with the idea that we're living in the 1700s. Which we're not. That's stupid. ",

They were the precursors to the later rock and punk countercultures of the 60s, 70s and 80s.\n\nThe first part is correct in that a counterculture developed in the USSR in urban cities that attempted to model contemporary western music and style. The second part is kinda mehish as the USSR's later countercultures were again heavily influenced by contemporary western style rather than a continuation of the Soviet counterculture. The post also suggests that the heavy censorship of western music continued into the 1960s and onwards. The heavy censorship of music was ended in 1957 after the death of Stalin and contemporary western music was widely available in the USSR not in the forum only by state manufactured records as well as bootleg copies that were created due to heavy demand and their usually lower price. \n\nThis website has library of most of the produced Soviet era records - http://records.su/\n\n&gt;The Nachthexen!\nAS if the name isn't awesome enough, have you heard of \"The Night Witches\"? Female pilots during WWII who were not allowed \"real\" planes, so they would fly their wood and fabric bombers to high altitudes and kill the engines within 100 miles of their targets and silently drop bombs on them. The Germans dubbed their enemies the Nachthexen. They also had one of the highest survival rates of any air force unit during the war. This is just a summary, and some are still living.\n\nFor one female pilots were allowed to use all produced aircraft in WW2 in both fighter and bomber roles with examples of [Lydia Litvyak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lydia_Litvyak) and [Anna Yegorova](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Yegorova) flying the Yak-1 and IL-2 respectively. The build of the Soviet air force in the 1920s and early 1930s produced one of the most advanced air forces in the world at the time, but the purges of Stalin exiled or killed much of the Soviet air industry as well the air force leadership which left them with a odd combination of whatever was left. The Po-2 was one of the most produced aircraft in history and was widely available in the early period of WW2 as well as being a slow and low flying plane that was capable of attacking positions at night accurately. \n\n&gt;The guy who could have lead them to the moon before the USA - Sergueï Korolev - died before he could because\n1 - he got his kidneys damaged in the death camps no one cares about\n2 - he died on the operating table for kidney surgery because they could not put a tube down his throat as his jaw was malformed after being broken by a rifle butt and not healing right.\nHe, and several other learned men, wound up in this camp because he was denounced as a saboteur by this dick with no evidence - they shot the other learned men - the point is...\nThe USSRs brutality bit them on the ass for a change\n\nThe reason for his death is still disputed with a possible scenario similar to that described by the comment, however the most likely and supported by his family is that he did die from a cancer and his already weakened heart from several previous heart attacks. The kidney disorder did exist and was diagnosed in 1960 after his first heart attack.\n\nhttp://russiapedia.rt.com/prominent-russians/space-and-aviation/sergey-korolev/",

I think this one's really self evident. There were no religions before Judaism so it's clear that we were not thinking of the soul or the mind. We just wanted a bite to eat. Naturally, there couldn't have been any sort of subjective experience.\n\nFirst of all, because there are jews involved, there are several 'starting points' for judaism, but the earliest [wikipedia will tell me](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origins_of_Judaism#Historical_background) is \n\n&gt;The central story of the Israelite nation is the Exodus of the Israelites from Egypt under the guidance of Moses, followed by the conquest of the Promised Land (Canaan). However, there is little or no archaeological or historical evidence to support these accounts, and although they may in part originate as early as the 10th century BCE, according to the Wellhausen hypothesis they reached something like their present form only in the 5th to 4th centuries BCE, when they are alleged to have been edited to comply with the theology of Second Temple Judaism.\n\nSo, moving on from when there, we have the question, was there religion before the jews? Now, the answer, quite obviously, is yes. [this articel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_religion#Prehistoric_period_.28300th_millennium_to_34th_century_BCE.29) clearly tells us:\n\n&gt;9130–7370 BCE\nThe apparent lifespan of Göbekli Tepe, one of the oldest human-made place of worship yet discovered,[14] including the Sphinx (dated to 9500 BCE) has also been found in a nearby site, Nevali Çori.\n\nIf this isn't evidence of organized religion, which is particularly not judaism. From here it ventures into /r/badscience and /r/badneurochemistry territory, but I'm pretty sure that it's all BS.",

Am I too late for the 4:30 autogyro?\n\nYou probably are, Burnsie. But also, you are obviously confused not just about what year it is but also about what year *you think* it is.\n\nThe Prussian consulate in Siam was established some time after 1862, when King Mongkut of Siam signed a treaty of mutual friendship, trade and shipping with the Prussian special envoy and leader of the Prussian East-Asia Expedition, Count Friedrich zu Eulenburg. Mostly after the foundation of the North German Federation in 1867 but at least the foundation of the German Empire in 1871 most of the Prussian delegates would have simply become German ones, so the name of the Prussian consulate should have changed to German consulate accordingly.  \nIn any case, the name would not have survived the abdication of Wilhelm II as King of Prussia and the proclamation of the Weimar Republic in 1918.\n\nSo you'd expect Mr. Burns' remark to refer to some time between 1862 and 1918, right? Well, this leads us to the next point: aeromail.\n\nThe first flight of the Wright Brothers happened in 1903. The first official airmail flight on the other hand was only made on February 18^th 1911 in British India, when Henri Pequet flew 6500 letters over a distance of 13km from Allahabad to Naini using a British copy of a French plane, the [Humber-Sommer biplane](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-R37016%2C_Berlin-Johannisthal%2C_Flugzeuge.jpg). This sparked the creation of scheduled national airmail routes in several countries, but the first international service would not run until after the war, when the UK established a route from Folkestone in Kent to Cologne in Germany that ran from December 1918 to the summer of 1919 to provide their occupying forces with a quick means of writing home.\n\nAlthough Germany technically had airmail since 1909, when LZ 6 became the first Zeppelin to do commercial passenger transport and regularly carry mail, which came to be known as *Zeppelin mail*. But I do doubt that German airships ever had the capacity and reliability to reach far from the motherland... [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZ_10_Schwaben) gives the maximum range of the most successful pre-war airship, LZ 10, as 1400km, which is about the distance from the north of Denmark to the south of Germany.\n\nAnd lastly, we come to the use of the word \"autogyro\". Word and concept both were invented by the Spanish engineer Juan de la Cierva in an attempt to create an unstallable aircraft... in 1923. And became more of a sideline thing with the development of reliable helicopters starting in the late 30s. Although Wikipedia tells me autogyros were used by the US Postal Service to ferry airmail arriving at the ariport in Camden, New Jersey to the roof of the post office building in downtown Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for some time in the 30s. Which is nice.\n\nIt might just be a cutaway joke, but blast it, at no time in history would Mr Burns have been able to get an international air delivery by an autogyro, especially not during a time when Prussia would have its own envoy in Siam. At least be behind the times *consistently*!",

Interestingly, he accuses another poster of a lack of reading comprehension surrounding this sentence, when in fact it's his own poor writing that caused the issue.\n\nProject Orion was a crazy awesome plan to launch things into orbit using nuclear bombs. It's arguably the only reasonable peaceful use of nuclear weapons. A shaped nuclear charge would detonate under the rocket (\"shaped\" meaning the blast expands in a specific direction). Using a thick metal plate to reflect the explosion, and then a suspension system to smooth out the acceleration (i.e., the passengers wouldn't have their neck snapped on every blast), the rocket would be hurled off into space. The largest Orion designs could be a cost-effective way of lifting a good sized city into orbit.\n\nTrouble is, even if you clear out the immediate area, every nuclear blast spreads radioactive isotopes around. This will cause additional cancer deaths somewhere on Earth. Exactly where and how many depends on the concentrations and wind patterns, but [one estimate](http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn1993-nuclear-test-fallout-killed-thousands-in-us.html#.VE_ZmRYsdl4) suggests that all Cold War testing caused an extra 11,000 US cancer deaths. You can try to make Utilitarian arguments on Orion launches being worth it or not (or whatever moral framework you prefer), but I won't get into that here.\n\nWhat is clear is that one of the project leaders, Freeman Dyson, wasn't comfortable with Orion causing even one death. The project had been slowing down by 1963 for other reasons, such as Apollo focusing on good ol' chemical rockets. That year, the Limited Test Ban Treaty prohibited the use of nuclear weapons in space, with no provision made for peaceful uses like Orion. [Dyson did indeed play a role in this treaty](http://fas.org/blogs/fas/2013/10/50th-anniversary-limited-test-ban-treaty/):\n\n&gt; Freeman Dyson, Professor Emeritus at the Institute for Advanced Studies at Princeton University, served as FAS chairman from 1962-1963 and argued in favor of the test ban. In August 1963, Prof. Dyson testified on behalf of FAS before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations in its hearings on the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.\n\nThe signing of this treaty is generally considered the formal end of Project Orion. This is probably what OP was trying to get at.\n\nBut that's not the treaty OP cited. He cited the Geneva Convention. Since OP couldn't be bothered to use the comma key himself, let's insert a few ourselves to make it readable:\n\n&gt; He realised it would be about 10 people, and shortly after, several events caused the end of the project, including the geneva convention against using such weapons.\n\nThis implies that the Geneva Convention ended the project. Was there any change in the Geneva Conventions during this time?\n\nPlainly, no. Most of the Geneva Conventions were in place before WWII, with some additions in 1949. Project Orion wouldn't start until 1958. Clearly, the project wasn't considered to conflict with any existing part of the Geneva Conventions at that time.\n\nAmendments to the Geneva Convention, Protocol I and II, were introduced in 1977. Protocol I does outlaw the use of weapons that are indiscriminate in their use on civilian populations, including nukes. However, this is specific to use of weapons in the context of a war, and was introduced much too late to affect Project Orion. Not only that, but the United States has yet to ratify Protocol I.\n\nThere's another way to insert commas into the sentence above to get something readable:\n\n&gt; He realised it would be about 10 people and, shortly after several events, caused the end of the project including the geneva convention against using such weapons.\n\nIn this reading, Dyson himself influenced the Geneva Conventions to ban nuclear weapons in the context of an Orion-style rocket. Besides the fact that the Geneva Conventions do no such thing, and come well after Project Orion was ended by other means, I could find no evidence that Dyson was involved in the 1977 amendments in any way.\n\nWith this pointed out, the thread takes a turn for the strange as OP lashes out to defend himself:\n\n&gt; the same subset of people always love to misread passages to suit some weird fact checking mission that just makes everyone get pissed off and ruin it... congratulations reddit.. you've literally killed interest in science through pretentiousness.\n\nThis reminds me of the counter-criticism we sometimes see for Cosmos (new or old)--it's somehow OK to get your facts all mangled up when it's in support of \"interest in science\".\n\nIt's not even like this is some fine detail that is lost on laymen. Simply citing the correct treaty would fix the problem. International Law does not begin and end with the Geneva Convention. It's also rich to be accusing others of a failure of reading comprehension when you can't demonstrate how to use a comma, and cause differing interpretations as a result.\n\nEdit: typo correction",

        "text": "While perusing my super-duper fancy-pants music on Youtube, I stumbled across [this comment](http://i.imgur.com/dE5mOTl.png) which purports to be praising Weird Al Yankovic. In actuality, it's spreading bad history and misinformation. What's wrong with it? Well, this particular comment claims that Weird Al has been making parodies better than the original since 2009. This is wrong. This is very, very wrong.\n\nFor those who are unaware, Weird Al Yankovic is a musician who writes parodies of popular songs and musical styles. He's been around for the last thirty years, and is currently experiencing a large upswing in popularity (indeed, I'd argue that the entire genre of parody and comedy music is experiencing an upswing). \n\nWeird Al's first parody song was aired on the Dr. Demento radio show in 1976, well before 2009. From there, his later parodies gained popularity until, in 1979, he got his first recording contract for his parody of \"My Sharona\" called [\"My Bologna.\"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4_G7HHJ0GE) Very classy. In 1981, his song [\"Another One Rides the Bus\"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZkouut-9RQ) gained enough popularity for him to have a television appearance. He started a band, had a top 40 hit with \"I Love Rocky Road\" in 1982, and, in 1984, recorded and released [\"Eat It,\"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcJjMnHoIBI) a parody of Michael Jackson's \"Beat It\" that cemented his place in music history. \n\nBeyond this, though, musical parody isn't a new genre, nor is Weird Al the oldest example of it. Two of Weird Al's inspirations were comedy musicians Alan Sherman and Tom Lehrer who wrote parodies, but are more known for their other compositions. This, in turn, was drawing off the previous influence of acts like Spike Jones and his City Slickers which would take popular music and add in new lyrics and wonky sound effects, much like what Weird Al would do. Even before then, parodies can be traced back to the 16th century - though in that case, the word \"parody\" meant \"borrowing\" not \"making fun of.\" Mozart is an exception to this, though, because he was Mozart and does that sort of thing. The parody as we know it became largely popularised during the 1950s and 1960s, though this borrowing existed throughout history and still does today.\n\nWhat changed to create the environment in which Weird Al thrived? Weird Al owes a lot of his popularity to music videos and MTV. With the music video came a new avenue to parody. Rather than just focusing on sounds and lyrics, a video gave an opportunity to parody the video as well. One reason \"Eat It\" became such a hit (hitting number 12 on the charts and not being surpassed until \"White and Nerdy\" in 2006) was because it was a shot for shot remake of the Michael Jackson video, just with new elements added in to reflect the new lyrics. Those who were familiar with the original song and video (AKA everybody) would have found the similarity and the parody on multiple levels highly entertaining. \n\nCouple with this a rise in superstars. People like Michael Jackson and Madonna were not just superstars, but fixtures in life in the 80s. Jackson, especially, made music happen and changed the face of it during that decade. By parodying Michael Jackson successfully, Weird Al gained the attention he needed to become seen as a legitimate musician in and of himself. Michael Jackson made Weird Al's career happen, and I'd argue that the choice to parody the likes of Madonna cemented it. \n\nIn any case, by 1989, he'd starred in a film (\"UHF\") and was as much a fixture in music as the musicians he parodied. In 1997, he had a TV show (\"The Weird Al Show\") and in 2006, his song \"White and Nerdy\" hit number 9 on the top 100 charts. He didn't release an album in 2009 - raising the question of what the original comment is referring to - but his most recent album did hit number 1 on the charts. There are movements to have him enshrined in the Hollywood Walk of Fame, in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and to have him perform at the Superbowl Halftime Show. While he's definitely undergoing a surge in popularity, Weird Al has been there for more than thirty years already. \n\nSources:\n\nIf you're interested in the current surge in popularity in parodies, I recommend [this](http://www.vulture.com/2013/06/rosen-lonely-island-lead-pop-parody-boom.html) article about parody and [this article](http://www.npr.org/2014/07/12/329873481/weird-al-yankovic-on-parody-in-the-age-of-youtube) about Weird Al specifically.",

        "text": "I love a good RepPill/ Dark Enlightenment chart: they see it as the extension of their STEM mastery but manage to get it wrong so often.\n\nFrom this submission on /r/ThePill pill here discuss a graph some of our favorite misogynists have been sharing on Twitter:\n\n[Original Post](http://np.reddit.com/r/TheBluePill/comments/2kcvfq/a_bunch_of_redpillers_and_dork_enlightenment/)\n\n[Graph](http://i.imgur.com/P7hj1gv.jpg)\n\nR5: A lot of this is more terrible statistics than bad history. On the top, you can't just overlay a graph looking at fertility rates with a scale from 4 to 1 over a graph tracking state expenditures and say SEE! NUMBERS! STATISTICS! But, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that these numbers are correct. And they make this wonderful interpretation:\n\n&gt;Instantly [when women get the vote] Taxes and Spending skyrocketed while fertility rates crashes. And instantly spending is higher than revenue. And of course it's MEN paying a larger portion of the taxes and WOMEN receiving a larger portion of the welfare\n\nAttributing these changes in economic state of the United States to women’s suffrage, just because they can overlay these numbers on one another, is just really really bad history. So I’m going to give them the benefit of the doubt that their numbers are correct and just go at the narrative they try to build: that women got the vote and immediately began to vote American into a welfare state. I don't even know what angle to start tearing this apart from. I guess I’ll keep it to two basic points: economic policy they don’t account for, and women’s actual voting habits\n\n1: Men paid higher taxes and women received more welfare. Might that have to do with the massive wealth disparity between the two? So you are basically just saying that people with more money pay higher taxes. You can point to things like the Sheppard-Towner act and say 'Look! Welfare!\" of 1921, but you also have to say that preventing infant mortality is a bad thing. The great expansion of state programs wouldn’t come until the policies created to combat the great depression: caused, of course, by the depression, not by women’s voting. The economic policies of the 20th century included tax cuts on the richest Americans by the Coolidge administration, and a lot of supply-side economics. There was no immediate response of raising taxes based on women’s suffrage. The wikipedia page “economic policy in the roaring 20’s” mentions women zero times (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roaring_Twenties). \n\nIn the second graph, they claim that \n\n&gt;U.S debt rose steadily until we hit another milestone\n\neven on their own graph, it doesn’t. It spikes for WWII (which was definitely women’s fault… someone friendzoned Hitler or something) and the decreases for a while. \nTheir big milestone is 1980 when “women because the majority of the electorate.” Hmmm what other significant events in economic history happened around the 1980’s? Maybe the massive tax deductions of the Reagan Administration? A president devoted to supply-side economics and tax cuts, during whose administration public debt rose from 26% of GDP to 41% of GDP? And the increase after doesn’t possibly having anything to do with several expensive wars, the entitlement expansions of an aging population and healthcare system with broken incentives?Nope it’s definitely those women voters. Which brings me to my second point\n\n\n\n2: This graph also seems to assume that a) all women starting voting when they could and that they voted the opposite way that men would. Neither of those are true. Many women who did vote voted along with their husbands (someone help me with a citation or tell me that I’m wrong here) On graph one, it’s crazy to assume that women IMMEDIATELY all started voting and IMMEDIATELY got legislation passed.\n\nThe second graph is even more egregious. They mark 1980 as the point at which women become the majority of the electorate. It’s really wrong on both ends of their argument. (Side note: how can they make both of these arguments at the same time? The first graph implies that women’s suffrage immediately made large changes in the economic policies of their states. But the second implies that nothing big happened until the overtook the poor menz. Which one is it?) [This graph](http://www.cawp.rutgers.edu/fast_facts/voters/documents/genderdiff.pdf) shows that in the early 60’s women were just beginning to overtake men in terms of voting participation. So, the first graph makes no sense because men were out-voting women. The second graph makes no sense because, at their 1980 turning point, women had been out-voting men for 15 years…. a period, in their graph, of slow but steady decline in national debt. Until Reagan ruined it. \n\nSo, yeah. Its not a huge surprise that these misogynists have a point of view that doesn’t really correspond to the facts. Just loved how wrong everything about this graph was. My first post, so if I suck a badhistory let me know how to do it better!\n",

While someone makes the point that average life expectancy is impacted by infant mortality, they then say this:\n\n&gt; Medical advances. A simple injury 1000 years ago could be fatal. Whereas today, if lets say you break a leg hiking, its a managable issue. Also it wouldn't prevent you from finding food, as it would have back then.\n\nOkay, I'm not an expert in medical history, but I suppose this is technically true as it is technically true today. I could conceivably get a small cut infected, and without proper treatment, die from it. And I suppose this was more possible \"back then\" as he says. But the idea that a broken leg wasn't manageable is ridiculous. A simple Google search yielded [this](http://jbjs.org/content/19/1/47), which suggests that bone fracture treatment existed 2-3 thousand years ago. I'm not suggesting our treatment methods haven't advanced that make broken bones *more* manageable, but it wasn't unmanageable 1000 years ago.\n\nIn response, this:\n\n&gt; Make that 100 years. Or 75.\n\nSeriously? An open wound 75 years ago (you know, 1939) was not a death sentence. People survived battlefield treatments of open wounds in most unsanitary conditions without issue. Medical amputations, which aren't even \"simple wounds\" were being used in the [17th century](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation#History). \n\n&gt; before penicillin just about any open wound could potentially kill you.\n\nThat's still true, but just because we have better treatments now doesn't mean there were no effective treatments then.\n\nI guess it's not the worst bad history in the world, but it's still pretty bad.",
