I've been using python for roughly 6 years right, learnt it after c++, I was using windows until about a year ago when i swapped to Linux. Every time i've had to install a python library in windows i've downloaded the source, built it and then installed it. If it had dependencies, I then did the same for each of them when the error came up about failing to import the correct module. When I got to linux i learnt I could actually use this godly command 'pip' I always read about people recommending to install x with 'pip install x' and I never could as 'pip' never existed. Well thats where my fuckup is, I thought it was only on linux as my windows path was wrong. TODAY, after at least 6 years, I learn that pip is under PythonX/Scripts. I fucked up man. I fucked up real bad. \n\nThe amount of modules I've found a way around because I didn't want to go find the correct binary is ghastly. Fuck.",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/programminghorror/comments/3fr49p/how_we_synchronized_databases_around_the_world_in/",
        "text": "I worked for a small privately owned information broker in the late 90's (heavily anonymized to protect me and the guilty). I was a paid intern still going through college. However, I was the only programmer on staff of about 4 or 5 people who had any formal education related to the job. That's not to put anybody down, it was just the reality of a small company in desperate need of programmers. \n\nWe worked on a rather strange platform based on the PICK database which was programmed in a flavor of BASIC. This platform, although outrageously expensive to license was really only designed to be a small-ish customer/order/inventory system that could easily be programmed to adopt to a small company's needs. It wasn't really up to the task of acting as a central database for a multinational repository of legal information. Which it soon grew into, and we programmers suddenly found that the platform was not up to the task.\n\nOne of the biggest hurdles was that the company opened international offices. We needed to synchronize international records that had legal details that were related to records at the HQ office. The naive approach meant that users were creating duplicate records, or worse, they were overwriting each other's work. We ultimately resolved this by creating master records (with a master ID) with info common to all countries and creating local child records that pointed back to the master record. For a database that wasn't relational, this was a feat for us to get it working in a way that met our needs.\n\nThe biggest challenge with this approach was that we didn't have the internet or tools we have today. We didn't have a live connection to the foreign offices. Hell, just getting a working modem or DSL connection in some countries was an achievement. We had a dedicated server that would dial up or connect to a foreign office, and download/upload the users' changes for the day.  This process could take hours for each office, then the data would have to processed on the local server. Even with the changes to allow child records dedicated to each foreign office, users were still creating master records that were overwriting each other because they were creating the same record ID's for different things. A user in the US would create record 123 with info ABC, and a user in Europe would created record 123 with info XYZ. Users would spend half their day reviewing the previous day's work to make sure they hadn't lost anything important. Draconian rules were setup to prevent users from creating records without jumping through a bunch of hoops. Users still clashed often.\n\nMy manager was at his wits end and called me into his office one morning and told me flat out that we had to solve this and soon or the company was in trouble. To this day, I'm not sure if it was a stroke of brilliance or ignorance or stupidity, but we pulled out a working solution in the next hour of discussion. I remember being really tired all the time from being in an intense Computer Science program and still working 25-30 hours a week. I blame the exhaustion. Because I'm sure someone could come up with a better solution if they tried. Note that there was no concept of a built-in GUID on this platform.\n\nOur solution was to create a \"bank\" of unused record ID's on the central server. Every day, the foreign server would call into the central server as part of the daily data synchronization process. The foreign server was given a daily allotment of unused record ID's for exclusive use and the central \"bank\" would record the ID's assigned to that server. When an application needed a new record, it would use one of the allotted ID's for that server. The allotted ID's were updated daily and each server was given enough ID's to make sure users were always able to create a new record on average.  One perk of this approach was the central office could audit all the new records created by each office and review them for accuracy or potential duplicates of existing master records. But more importantly, we no longer had users overwriting each other's work by accident. This did not come without downsides. We had to have a dedicated server act as The Bank, and all applications that needed new record ID's needed to update their write routines to request a new key from the local repository instead of just creating an ID on their own. If they ran out of keys for that day, new records could not be created until the daily update.\n\nI still don't know if I should be proud or ashamed of this. It was a working solution in the heady days of the early internet. After leaving the company years later, I was told that they converted their platform over to a proper SQL database and those legacy headaches went away.\n\n",

He showed me this code, and I wish I could have convinced him to let me make a copy.\n\nTask: skip the 11 line header of a file, and then process() the rest.\n\nThe solution:\n\n    Open up a file in /tmp (called StripBright)\n    Into that file, write out a c-shell script, which:\n    * Used wc -l to count the number of lines in the file\n    * Used c-shell expressions to subtract 11 from the line count\n    * used tail -%d to get the last N lines of the file and put them in another file (hardcoded to I think /tmp/stripped).\n\n    Then call system(\"chmod a+x /tmp/StripBright\");\n    Then call system(\"/tmp/StripBright\");\n\n    Then open the new file and call process() on it.\n    Then system(\"rm /tmp/stripped /tmp/StripBright\")\n\nNow mind you, this file was 40 megabytes long, back when that was a big deal.  1.44 megabyte floppy days.  At the time I had a lunchbox-sized 3 Gigabyte hard drive that cost $3200.  So instead of just, say, reading and ignoring the first 11 lines and continuing, they copied nearly the whole damn file in the stupidest way I could imagine, then or since.  \n\nThis only came to my roommate's attention because the hardcoded paths made it fail intermittently when more than one person tried to run the code at once.",

        "text": "We were tasked to investigate why a particularly crusty C# application stopped displaying some data from our API. The code fetched the JSON data successfully from the API but silently failed somewhere thereafter.\n\nWe traced the problem to a line of code that was doing a regex split. The regex was set to match a single JSON record from an array that looked something like this:\n\n    [\n        {\"id\":1,\"name\":\"foo\", ... \"comments\":5},\n        {\"id\":2,\"name\":\"bar\", ... \"comments\":3},\n        ...\n    ]\n\nCurious, because elsewhere we could see that the code parsed JSON. Hopefully they weren't parsing our JSON with regexes! It turns out the C# master who wrote the code thought it would be good to use a regex to split the JSON into an array of records before parsing. In other words, the JSON response string was split to individual records (id 1, id2, etc.) AND THEN parsed into objects.\n\nSo when we added a feature to the API, the JSON contained a new field after \"comments\". The regex no longer matched and the code reported that zero records were returned.\n\nWe looked at changing the C# code but discovered that the regex and its bizarre splitting was copy pasted all over! We decided instead to update our API and move \"comments\" to the end (after our new fields) so that the regex would match again. Long live the regexes!\n\nSo many headdesks.",

One past dev didn't know how to do null checks when running a sql update on a table.\n\nso instead of null checking the parameter with something like\n    update Table set Field1 = isnull(@Field1, Field1)  \nhe would construct a dynamic sql statement  \n    if @Field1 is not null set @SqlString = @SqlString + ' ,Field1 = '  cast(@Field1 as varchar)  ...... exec(@SqlString)\n\nThen another dev recognized this as a security flaw (injection attacks).

Inside the opening tag other attributes may be present before or after the `href` attribute which shall be ignored.\n&gt; * newlines inside `LINK TEXT` are part of the link text; anything inside the `a`-tag is part of the link text.\n&gt; * no tags appear between `&lt;a ...&gt;` and `&lt;/a&gt;`.\n&gt; * `a`-tags which do not contain an `href` attribute are to be ignored.\n&gt; * the input does not contain any comments.\n&gt;\n&gt; Please refrain from submitting an answer until your program yields the sample output on the sample input.\n\nThe deadline for this exercise has passed, so I can finally publish this including my [answer](https://gist.github.com/fuzxxl/1d66f419f44a1d3154af).\n\nBonus points: The sample input is not valid xhtml in any version. It's not even well-formed xml. The way the testing program (which uses the lexer we're supposed to set up) is written makes it clear that whoever made this task doesn't have much of an idea about how to use `lex`. For example, it does this to check if the end of file is reached:\n\n    \twhile ((token = yylex()) != EOF) {\n\nwhere `EOF` is from `stdio` and equals to `-1`. Everybody who used `lex` at least once knows that `yylex` returns `0` on end of file. While it's possible to hack something to this effect with some unportable extensions of `flex`, it's not what you're supposed to do. Also, the makefile that is used to compile our lexer (we're not supposed to change it) does not link with `-ll`, so certain functions are absent and some things cannot be done.\n\nThis is the first time an exercise made me seriously doubt the competence of our TAs.\n\n",

        "text": "I'm trying to create a Windows screensaver from scratch. I have the window set to automatically fill the screen and set to \"always on top\", and quit when it detects mouse or keyboard activity. Now I temporarily disabled the part of the code that makes it quit so I could debug something.\n\nYou may know where this is heading. I start the program, having forgotten it runs \"always on top\", and find myself unable to use any other applications. But it's not *that* bad, right? I could always do Win+R, C, M, D, Enter, alt+tab over to the command prompt window, and blindly type a taskkill command, right?\n\nNope. `taskkill /f /im` isn't enough. It just gives me the dreaded (well, for me) error \"There is no running instance of the task.\" I've gotten this error before, and in every case I've given up and rebooted my computer before I was able to quit the process, when I got tired of having a useless window that I can't close or minimize serving as dead weight.\n\nUsually this happens with Cheat Engine when it stops responding in kernel mode. In that case I can understand it, as that program is designed to run as much \"above\" the operating system as it can. But yesterday it inexplicably happened with another program I was debugging. Annoying, yes, but that's no big deal. Unfortunately, it decided to happen again, with the worst type of window for it to occur with.\n\nNow normally I would just reboot. Only I'm copying a bunch of files in the background, totaling almost a terabyte, if not more. I don't want to interrupt that, cause it might be a pain to get running again, I want to be absolutely sure everything is copied correctly. So I try some other things.\n\nI know Windows provides a function to have multiple \"desktops\". This isn't what you're probably thinking, like what other operating systems have had for a while but Windows won't have until Windows 10. This functionality isn't directly exposed to the user, but rather can be created and switched to using the Windows API. These other desktops don't have a taskbar or icons or anything, and are more like the screen that appears when the computer is locked. But I can still open windows on one, so I try using some test programs I created for that. But apparently I don't have one that will actually create a new one to switch to, only one that will switch to an existing one. And the only other existing one is Winlogon (the lock screen) which I can't just switch to and open programs on. So that plan's out.\n\nNext, I remember NirCmd (Google it; I'm not going to find a link, for reasons that will be explained later) and its ability to manipulate windows from the command line, including hiding them so they basically don't appear. I try `nircmd win hide title` and then the name of the window that's in the way, and...nothing. I use Alt+Tab and hover over the command prompt window so I can see its contents in the preview, and it didn't give me any kind of error message. I try again with a Calculator window I have running, and that works fine, so it can't be a problem with the syntax. I guess it just doesn't work on those glitched processes, because that would just be too good to be true. (I happen to have Cheat Engine in that state as well, so I tried it with that, and that doesn't work either.)\n\nIt's then that I press the Windows key and realize the Windows 8.1 Start screen is still able to display. (I probably pushed the key before, but that didn't register as important until now.) I get the idea to try opening a Metro-style app. I figure having a Web browser would be useful, so I type \"Internet Explorer\" in the search box. Only one result, and it's the desktop version. I check the apps list, and the Metro version isn't installed.\n\nSo I go to the Windows Store to download it--or, rather, if I'm going there anyway, I might as well download a better browser like Firefox or Chrome. I type \"Store\" and select the icon, and it actually opens! I search for \"Firefox\", and nothing comes up but the usual ebook spam or whatever that is. I try \"Chrome\" and there it is--wait, no, that says \"Desktop app\". So I guess I'll settle for Internet Explorer then. I type \"Internet Explorer\" and...*still nothing?* I could have sworn Internet Explorer has a Metro version. In fact I know for a fact that it does.\n\nSo, what web browsers *are* available then? I search for \"web browser\" to see what my options are. The top result is literally just called \"Web Browser\" and costs $19.99. What could justify spending 20 bucks on a Web browser I've never heard of? Let's read the description:\n\n&gt; Don't like Major Web Browsers like Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer?  Web Browser is a great alternative Web Browser for anybody looking for something a little different.\n\n...Really. The vast majority of the other options either cost money or aren't actually a web browser. I find one called \"Quebracho\" that's free and is the second result, so I decide to give it a try. I install it, and all that's on the screen are the back/forward buttons, an address bar (that displays the URL but doesn't actually let you enter one; instead it searches for the URL on Google, and it's the Russian Google for some reason) and the browser logo. And the bottom third or so of the screen isn't even used; it's just solid red, like they forgot to make the browser scale vertically.\n\nSo here I am, typing this post in a shitty Web browser I doubt anyone here has heard of, hoping it doesn't crash on me. (Hold on one second, let me select and copy this text just in case...there.) What will I try next? I guess I'll look for a Metro-style text editor that will let me write a quick C program to use that \"desktop\" functionality to create and switch to a new desktop. Then at least I'll be able to use a decent Web browser to try and find a solution, and actually use other desktop applications to troubleshoot without just blindly typing into them.\n\nWell, here goes!\n\n----\n\n**EDIT:** Okay, apparently that doesn't work. I can switch to a new desktop, but I can't actually open windows on it. I could have sworn I could have before. I guess I could create a new user, but I don't know how to do that from the command line.....wait a minute, Windows' Metro-style Settings app! Finally, it's useful in a way Control Panel isn't! Okay, that should do for now.\n\n**EDIT2:** So creating another user account wasn't as helpful as I thought it would be, mainly because I couldn't as easily try things to get rid of that window without constantly switching users. But from there I was able to switch my monitor to portrait mode. So instead of 1920x1080, it was 1080x1920. The window was still horizontal though, so I had some space at the bottom of the screen to try some stuff. And I don't know what I did, but suddenly I noticed the window wasn't set as \"always on top\" anymore! I could actually put windows over it! And if I do Win+D, I can even access the desktop! Opening another window will cause it to come back, but at least I can comfortably use my PC.",

Since it's in a heredoc block it doesn't do anything to resolve the issue (single quotes are ignored inside the heredoc block).\n\nThe script has yet to be updated by OP, who left the thread after stating his opinion on fixing security vulnerabilities:\n\n&gt; If I were to go back and fix for security vulnerabilities and still accomplish the same functionality, I'd be better off reimplementing it in another language.\n\nTo be fair, he did add a disclaimer at the bottom of his blog post referencing the script:\n\n&gt; Please note that allowing strings from the MediaWiki API to be passed directly as  an argument to a shell command could be harmful if someone maliciously edited the article being queried to include special shell characters and commands.\n\nProblem solved!\n\nEdit: formatting.",

        "text": "I got into web development about 5 years ago. At the time, I knew next to nothing about programming in general, let alone webdev. My first job was to maintain a PHP application written by my predecessor, who knew little more than I (it's very much learn-as-you-go here - all of my training was basically on the job).\n\nAnyway, as you can imagine a lot of the code I found in this application was... less than perfect. Part of the app deals with warehouse inventory. In particular, there are certain item codes (user specified) that should be omitted from processing. Users can specify patterns to ignore that then needed to be translated into regex. My predecessor's solution was to match the pattern strings themselves with regex and return the regex that corresponds to the pattern. Here's what that looked like:\n\n    $ignore = $db-&gt;query(\"Select To_Ignore from Auto_Ignore\");\n    unset($matchType);\n    unset($found);\n    while($result = $ignore-&gt;fetch_array())\n    {\n        if(!isset($found))\n        {\n            $new = preg_replace(\"/(.+)\\[\\[(\\w+)\\]\\](.+)/\", \"$2\", $result['To_Ignore']);\n            if($new == $result['To_Ignore'])\n            {\n                $new = preg_replace(\"/\\[\\[(\\w+)\\]\\](.+)/\", \"$1\", $result['To_Ignore']);\n                if($new == $result['To_Ignore'])\n                {\n                    $new = preg_replace(\"/(.+)\\[\\[(\\w+)\\]\\]/\", \"$2\", $result['To_Ignore']);\n                    if($new == $result['To_Ignore'])\n                    {\n                        //Dictionary Value can not be resolved\n                    }\n                    else\n                    {\n                        $matchType = 3;\n                    }\n                }\n                else\n                {\n                    $matchType = 2;\n                }\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                $matchType = 1;\n            }\n            if($new == \"VAR\")\n            {\n                if($matchType == 1)\n                {\n                    $first = preg_replace(\"/(.+)\\[\\[(\\w+)\\]\\](.+)/\", \"$1\", $result['To_Ignore']);\n                    $second = preg_replace(\"/(.+)\\[\\[(\\w+)\\]\\](.+)/\", \"$3\", $result['To_Ignore']);\n                    $pattern = \"/\".$first.\"(\\w+)\".$second.\"/\";\n                }\n                elseif($matchType == 2)\n                {\n                    $first = preg_replace(\"/\\[\\[(\\w+)\\]\\](.+)/\", \"$2\", $result['To_Ignore']);\n                    $pattern = \"/(\\w+)\".$first.\"/\";\n                }\n                elseif($matchType == 3)\n                {\n                    $first = preg_replace(\"/(.+)\\[\\[(\\w+)\\]\\]/\", \"$1\", $result['To_Ignore']);\n                    $pattern = \"/\".$first.\"(\\w+)/\";\n                }\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                if($matchType == 1)\n                {\n                    $first = preg_replace(\"/(.+)\\[\\[(\\w+)\\]\\](.+)/\", \"$1\", $result['To_Ignore']);\n                    $second = preg_replace(\"/(.+)\\[\\[(\\w+)\\]\\](.+)/\", \"$3\", $result['To_Ignore']);\n                    $pattern = \"/\".$first.\"(\\w{\".$new.\"})\".$second.\"/\";\n                }\n                elseif($matchType == 2)\n                {\n                    $first = preg_replace(\"/\\[\\[(\\w+)\\]\\](.+)/\", \"$2\", $result['To_Ignore']);\n                    $pattern = \"/(\\w{\".$new.\"})\".$first.\"/\";\n                }\n                elseif($matchType == 3)\n                {\n                    $first = preg_replace(\"/(.+)\\[\\[(\\w+)\\]\\]/\", \"$1\", $result['To_Ignore']);\n                    $pattern = \"/\".$first.\"(\\w{\".$new.\"})/\";\n                }\n            }\n            if(isset($matchType))\n            {\n                $check = preg_replace($pattern, \"$1\", $key);\n                if($key != $check)\n                    $found = 1;\n            }\n            if($result['To_Ignore'] == $key)\n                $found = 1;\n        }\n    }\n\nAnd here's the same section after I changed it to manipulate the pattern strings themselves:\n\n    $ignore = $db-&gt;query(\"Select To_Ignore from Auto_Ignore\");\n    $found = false;\n    while($result = $ignore-&gt;fetch_array())\n    {\n        if( $result['To_Ignore'] == $key ) {\n            $found = true;\n            break;\n        }\n        //Convert Auto_Ignore entry into a regular expression\n        elseif(strpos($result['To_Ignore'], \"[[\") !== false &amp;&amp; strpos($result['To_Ignore'], \"]]\") !== false) {\n            list($front, $inside) = explode(\"[[\", $result['To_Ignore']);\n            list($inside, $back) = explode(\"]]\", $inside);\n            \n            if($inside == \"VAR\")\n                $inside = \"+\";\n            else\n                $inside = \"{\".$inside.\"}\";\n\n            $check = preg_replace(\"/\".$front.\"(\\w\".$inside.\")\".$back.\"/\", \"$1\", $key);\n            \n            if($key != $check) {\n                $found = true;\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n    }",

But all too often, the config files get all messed up, causing `KeyError`'s.\n\nProblem 'solved', by his widespread use of statements like these:\n\n    AWS_ACCESS_KEY = SETTINGS.get('aws_access_key')\n    AWS_SECRET_KEY = SETTINGS.get('aws_secret_key')\n\nEDIT: **The root issue is that he doesn't understand to \"fail fast, fail often\"; he actually went out of his way to avoid it, by using `get()` instead of `[]`.**\n\nHere's what I've been changing these to:\n\n    AWS_ACCESS_KEY = SETTINGS['aws_access_key']\n    AWS_SECRET_KEY = SETTINGS['aws_secret_key']\n\n`dict.get()` will always return something, usually a specified default value, although _here there's no reasonable default value_. `dict[]` on the other hand, throws an error if the key isn't found. He doesn't understand how to handle errors, though, and thinks they're a Bad Thing. So he changes his code to never throw errors.\n\n**Instead, his code simply fails mysteriously sometime, somewhere.**",

Means code standards should be kind of hight right?\n\nToday I needed to grab some data from a notification (to get the notifications running you have to set up a system invoking macros and other horrors to produce an 'almost singleton'. You have to instantiate the class yourself, is someone else does it, it overrides your instantiation too. You also can't use your instantiation, only the static entrypoint. Sweet).\n\nWell so I finally catch the notifications and, of course, depending the kind of notification, you want to do different things. So how do I check what type it is?\n\nThe notification comes as a (size_t data) variable that, I promise, you have to cast on a TriggerEvent class as a pointer. Not even a void pointer, a friggin int.\n\nThat's okay right? I mean what could go wrong here?\n\nSo I'm checking out the type of the triggered action, okay, this type is one I want to treat, so how do I do that? In the interface of TriggerEvent there is just one function that doesn't return zero...\n\n*\n\nIt returns a pointer.\n\nSort of.\n\nThis particular pointer is actually a TCHAR string that has the pointers address encoded as a hexadecimal string.\n\nO_o\n\nDecode to a number, force the reference of a pointer to that value, cast it on the right class and I could finally check out my notification.\n\nYeah, the guy doing it is the chief architect of the project... wish me good luck.\n",

        "text": "I've just discovered LINQPad and it's the best thing EVER for querying databases (and inserting/updating them if you want to). Instead of writing antique long ass TSQL to perform even the simplest queries you can just go `Order.Take(10)` or `Order.Where(x =&gt; x.amount &gt; 10).Select(x =&gt; new { x.amount, x.date})`, or, and this is quite literally the best of the best things,  you can do joins by just using the dot notation: `Order.Where(x =&gt; x.customer.name == \"Super Dude\").Take(10)`.\n\nOf course, the last feature requires a foreign key constraint between the two tables so that Linq2Sql can generate the accessors.\n\nAnd we don't do foreign keys. Hundreds of thousands of SLOC, hundreds of \"soft\" foreign keys, thousands of clients that will probably maybe throw away important data when they synchronize themselves with the server and the foreign key constraint is no longer valid or maybe the client didn't check the constraint in the first place because god knows what sqlite version is running on the client. And even if I find time to add the constraints I can already feel the ABSOLUTE FUN of manually checking every single bloody table for references (upshot: we don't do foreign keys, but we also don't do DELETEs!).\n\nLINQPad is awesome and I can't use the most awesome feature of them all because we don't do foreign keys.\n\nI also have a small internal tool that has maybe 10 references or so but each and every one of them refers to an object on a web service.\n\nDAMN",
