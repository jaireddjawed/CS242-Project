Is it even a national holiday? Do you guys get Easter Monday off?\n\nIt's strange that Christmas has been so hyper-commercialized, and Easter isn't talked about at all.

        "text": "In the year 2XXX, many groups of stakeholders are jostling for a new world order. They want to be recognized for the rights they have, and they want the rights to a new standing in society. **The ideal goal of each stakeholder is not to shoot the rest down, but to achieve balance in between the races.** Stakeholders include\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* Biologically unaltered humans  - your regular human. He is what you are now. He voluntarily stays unaltered.\n\n* Biologically altered humans, *quite* superior in every aspect to their natural counterpart. Of course, they are looking to govern society given the fact that they are superior. The only sort of nerf he has, is that he is **born an unaltered human** (don't question the science behind that, I don't know) and modification has to be carried out for every person born (not once per family line)\n\n* Cyborgs - biological humans with mechanized body parts  \n\n* Robots - with simple AI, but with superior strength. They are the builders of society.  \n\n* Androids - Something like robots but with lesser strength and a slightly more advanced AI. They can potentially be put to work in sectors such as retail, education, chauffeuring etc  \n\n* Artificial Intelligence - A bit ironic to try to argue in the spot of artificial intelligence, because well, they're too smart. They lack a physical manifestation but are at the pinnacle of intelligence. Common argument - we can rule society because we are the smartest.\n\nAs you can see, the paleos are pretty much at the bottom of the social ladder along with the robotic slave.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe terms I have described are somewhat ambiguous but that was exactly how I received it. Arguing from the point of AI/altered humans is somewhat easier because they have the ability to be put into the upper echelons of society. However, what has a paleo (unaltered) human have to put in their argument to not be left at the bottom of society?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThe impression I get from having to defend from the standpoint of biologically unaltered humans is like trying to argue Windows XP is better than Windows 10, *et cetera.* It is a position that many others have found themselves in throughout history (but the indians still pretty much lost to the colonialists)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThat being said, the only defenses I can think of is that the ability to adapt is built in to human nature that has led up to now - and that we can guide the ruling body with our experience as a biological creature. // we are not susceptible to hacking (then again, we don't know if our puny human minds can decrypt the crazy encryption potentially invented by other intelligent stakeholders) //  we are the primogenitors of civilization.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAll these arguments have their loopholes and of course can be exploited. What do you think is the best defense for the unaltered human race such that we don't end up as a species in an exhibit in a fancy zoo?\n\n\nI understand that arguing and coming in as a complete victor in such a position is (nigh) impossible, so what compromises can we make? (we definitely can't be the ruling class)",

How long could a synthetic posthuman exist before one of these events led to their destruction?\n\nHas anyone done any looking into how long synthetic posthumans could exist for before random destruction?\n\nI mean earth has existed for billions of years without being destroyed by a cosmological event such as being destroyed by a black hole.

A savvy businessman/manager would hire them for lower than the market wage and make profit. If sufficiently many people do this, then the wage gap would close.\n\nBut I know that doesn't happen.

Many people find the treatment of animals in places like circuses and SeaWorld to be cruel, and it seems like the life expectancy rates of these captive animals proves their point. A lot of the trouble seems to stem from keeping the animals in confined areas for too much of their life, but would you consider the training programs also cruel? Does it matter the species? Is there a difference between training dolphins and elephants for shows than from training horses and dogs? Is the treatment of animals in circuses harsher than other animal training programs such as horse racing or dressage?\n",
