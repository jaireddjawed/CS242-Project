        "text": "tl;dr - I had several dreams of deceased loved ones coming back to talk with me.\n\nI already submitted another post full of weirdness, but reading some of the other posts made me think of glitches in a slightly different light. My last post was about things that happened while I was wide awake...I didn't think to include the weirdness of dreams. Maybe nobody else will count these as matrix glitches, but I do.\n\n1 - I was very close to my ex's dad (we'll call him \"Martin\"), formerly my father-in-law, and we remained close even after his son and I (amicably) split up. My own father has always been present in my life, but I'm not always sure that that's a good thing. He's volatile, aggressive, emotionally abusive, unbelievably impatient, paranoid, ignorant, judgmental, spiteful, and rude. He's improved slightly with age, but there's no possibility of anything more than a superficial relationship with him. Martin was everything I had always wanted in a dad - he was educated, cultured, considerate, patient, well-mannered, witty, and great conversation. He quickly became my father-substitute (and I suspect I became, for him, the daughter he never had), and we could sit and laugh and talk for hours about any topic in the world.\n\nWhen Martin died in 2010 only 3 months after being diagnosed with stage IV cancer, it was a gut-wrenching nightmare. He was the patriarch of his family, and everyone, including me, felt the loss deeply. I wrote his obituary myself. But I only dreamed of him once, two years after he died. In the dream, which was extremely vivid and detailed, I was standing to one side of the living room of my grandparent's house (a place that was like home to me, but where Martin had never been), and suddenly Martin appeared in the middle of the room. It was daytime outside and I could see him clearly in the sunlight coming through the windows, but he looked blurry around the edges. He seemed pleasantly surprised to find himself there, and was looking down at his body and limbs, sort of inspecting himself with interest, like he hadn't seen himself in a long time. I was gaping at him in astonishment, and finally blurted out, \"...What are YOU doing here??\" Even in my dream, I knew that he was supposed to be dead, but I wasn't afraid, just amazed to see him. He looked up in surprise and his big, familiar grin lit up his whole face. His deep voice gave me his usual greeting: \"Heyyyy missy! They let us come back sometimes, just to say hello and let you know we're okay.\" I stared at him, open-mouthed, for a moment, and then said, \"Well...so...what's it like over there?!?\" He reflected happily for a moment and then said, \"It's beautiful. Everything there is wonderful.\" Then he started to fade, and called out to me, \"My time's up! I love you!\" and then he was gone and I woke up. My grief over his death disappeared almost entirely after that. I sincerely felt/feel that I saw him, and that it was the \"real\" Martin saying goodbye and letting me know he was happy and not to worry. I never saw him again, but I could tell after that dream that I never would; he had said what he needed to say and moved on. I think it's important to note here that I'm staunchly non-religious and a serious skeptic, but that I don't discount the possibility of something greater than ourselves, or the notion that consciousness may have a way to survive physical death. Martin's visit went a long way in making me suspect consciousness really does endure somehow.\n\n2 - My grandparents (dad's parents; my mom's folks died a long time ago) both passed away last year less than 2 months apart. Both died of lung cancer, as they were longtime heavy smokers. I was especially close to my grandmother, and since I was about 13 I've never gone longer than maybe a week without talking to her. They lived in a cute little house out in the country on a couple of acres of land, about 175 miles from our city, and we spent practically every holiday and school break at their house, playing tag in the yard, swinging on the tire swing, helping Pampaw in the garden, cooking with Mamaw, etc. In turn, I brought my own kids to visit frequently (I'm in my early 30's now). They loved going to see Mamaw and Pampaw, and my grandparents loved seeing their great-grandkids. Christmases and Thanksgivings and regular old get-togethers were also held at their house, and the whole family would come. We're a close-knit family, and my grandparents were its nexus. \n\nWhen Pampaw died, of course it hurt. The only thing that softened it was that he was ready to die and totally unafraid. When Mamaw died seven weeks later, we took that blow full force. She wasn't ready to die, and was doing everything she could in her treatment to give herself more time with us. It didn't work. She met her end gracefully, with the whole family by her side, but it broke our hearts because we knew she didn't want to leave. As the oldest of the three grandkids, and the one who'd spent the most time with her by far, I was particularly tormented by her passing and spent a disproportionate amount of the following weeks crying (unusual, as I'm not normally a very emotional person) and wishing I could talk to her just one more time.\n\nOne night before bed, I suddenly remembered the dream visit I'd had from my father-in-law a few years earlier, and I closed my eyes and thought desperately, *\"Mamaw, I want to see you again!!\"* And I did. In my dream, I was in their house, standing in the kitchen. Other relatives were there, talking and laughing and helping prepare lunch, and I was standing there, puzzled, trying to remember something. Mamaw was there, across the kitchen from me, standing a little apart from the others, silently watching everyone else chatting and making food, and she suddenly noticed me. She looked like she was surprised to see me, but happy I had come. She was never very physically affectionate, but she walked straight over to me and gave me a long, tight hug. I gladly hugged her back, but I clearly remember thinking how unusual it was for her to hug like this. It was the hug you give someone when you want to reassure them that everything is okay, or when you haven't seen them in a very long time. She stepped back and smiled at me, and told me she was better now. I looked closely at her; something was different about her, but I couldn't put my finger on it. She laughed and jogged (jogged!!) to the front door, then went right through it! My mouth fell open in amazement. Through the front window, I saw her casually float up into the air, laugh again, and disappear. I was stunned, but I understood that she was showing me what she could do now. She wasn't hurting or held back by a body that was no longer working properly. Then I woke up and remembered what I couldn't think of in the dream - Mamaw was dead. I rolled over and cried, simultaneously missing her and feeling so happy I got to see her again. It didn't dawn on me until the next day what was so different about her in my dream. She wasn't old anymore. It's not that she was young, but she just wasn't any age. It was like I got to see HER, as she really was, without there being any number that I could assign to her. Maybe it was just a dream, but it felt so real, even though obviously there were unreal elements to it.\n\nI had several more dreams about her over the next few weeks. Maybe she knew one wasn't enough for me. The day before one of the dreams, I had been thinking about her and it suddenly struck me that I didn't have a grandmother anymore. I had always had a grandmother, my whole life, and now she was gone. That thought stuck with me for most of the day and made me sad. That night, I dreamed I was in her kitchen, standing behind her usual chair at the table, when she came walking purposefully around the corner from the bedroom like she had been looking for me. She walked up, put her hands on her hips, and firmly set me straight. \"Why are you saying you don't have a grandmother anymore? I'm still your grandmother! That hasn't changed!\" I was surprised that she was kind of scolding me, but I realized she had a good point, and I agreed with her. I smile now whenever I think of that. She was right. \n\nI still miss her so much, but it doesn't hurt like it did when I think of her. I haven't dreamed of her in months, but I don't feel certain that I'll never see her again. She was always a busybody who liked to do the rounds checking up on people (which I didn't mind), and it would be just like her to drop in again after a while to check on me. I also spoke with my uncle (my grandparents' youngest son) over this past summer, and I told him the dreams I had about Mamaw. He was frozen, listening intently, and he teared up and whispered that she had come to him in dreams too, that the dreams seemed real to him as well. Guess she's making the rounds.\n\nI would say these dreams are glitches in the matrix because, as weird as it sounds, I think Martin and Mamaw were both real in them, which defies our conventional knowledge of how things are supposed to work. The dead aren't supposed to continue existing and then come back and have conversations with you in your dreams and tell you they're okay. But I think they really did it.",

        "text": "Tl;dr - A book vanished and then reappeared in the same spot; a poster flapped for hours in a closed-off room with totally still air; a heavy ceramic bowl flung itself onto the kitchen floor and shattered; heavy, solid front door endures much physical abuse without effect after I got locked out, only to creak open after my backpack accidentally brushes lightly against it.\n\nI have some strange glitch stories, pretty mild compared to a lot of these others, but they happened. All of these took place at the house I lived in with my mom and brother when I was a teenager (I'm in my early 30's, so this is during the late '90's, early '00's).\n\n#1 - I was a super bookworm/introvert who would gladly spend my entire life holed up in my room reading everything I could get my hands on if I were allowed. So one Saturday evening when I was about 15, I was doing just that. I was actually reading Latin For Dummies (because I was a big nerd who enjoyed learning about other languages), which is relevant because the cover is mostly bright orange and very hard to miss. Anyway, so I'm lying in bed reading when I hear my mom call to me from the living room. I get up and carefully put my book face-down and open on the floor right next to my bed. I remember clearly because I'm trying to make sure I don't damage the spine, leaving it in that position. I walk out of my room and down the hall, past my 12-year-old brother's bedroom door (it was closed, but I could hear him doing his usual thing of talking on the cordless to his best friend and playing Tony Hawk on the PlayStation). I stop at the end of the hallway, looking into the living room. Mom's chilling on the couch watching a movie with her longtime boyfriend (my folks divorced when I was 4). She asks me a question about something, I reply, she responds with something along the lines of \"Oh ok, I was just wondering, thanks,\" and I turn and walk back to my room, step inside, close the door, and lock it (little bro has a way of barging in during some of my more private exploratory teenage girl moments, so I'm in the habit of locking every door every time). I get halfway across my small room before my eyes zero in on the spot next to my bed where I set my book. It's gone. I just freeze mid-step and stare in total disbelief, because I know goddamn well that there's nobody in the house except me, brother, mom, and her boyfriend, and none of them had moved from their locations during the 45 seconds I was out of my room. There's no possible explanation for the missing book, but there HAS to be an explanation because books don't just vanish into thin air, so I'm frozen, staring at the blank stretch of floor beside my bed, while my mind goes around and around through this loop, trying to make sense of this sudden disappearance. I decide the only not-crazy explanation is that I must have actually set the book down somewhere else in the room, even though I know that's utter horseshit. So I start searching my room for it. Pulling blankets off the bed, checking my dresser, my bookshelf, my closet, everywhere. I even get down on my hands and knees TWICE and put my face inches away from where the book had been, to make TOTALLY sure I'm not just somehow managing to not see it even though it's in plain sight. Nothing. I cannot find this fucking book to save my life. I'm puzzled beyond belief but I continue searching for like 20 minutes, occasionally throwing confused glances back at the spot next to my bed. Suddenly, it's just there again. Exactly the way I left it, on the exact page, in the exact spot. I'm fucking FLOORED. I just stare in this mixture of fascination, alarm, horror, and wonder. I pick it up before it can wander the fuck off again and look around the room suspiciously. Nobody could've put it there. The bedroom door was shut and locked, I could still hear my brother talking on the phone through the wall that separated our rooms, and nobody could've even snuck in my window and played a prank - we had heavy duty burglar bars on all our windows and doors. Never could explain what happened.\n\n#2 - Roughly a year before the book incident, so I'm about 14. Titanic had recently come out in theaters (remember what a big deal that movie was? lol) and I had a big Titanic movie poster hung on the inside of my bedroom door. At the time I hung it up, I could only find two thumbtacks, so of course those each went into the top corners, leaving the bottom hanging down freely. It was a school night, dark outside, and I was once again lying in bed reading a book (not the Latin one). I had my desk lamp on to provide enough light for reading, but so the light wouldn't be too bright and annoying when I dozed off. As a relevant side note, I always always always slept with my ceiling fan on. It made loud, irregular clacking noises, but I was so used to it that I didn't notice, and I liked the strong, cool breeze. I'm lying there absorbed in my book, and I notice movement out of the corner of my eye. It's the Titanic poster, sort of billowing/flapping out away from the door in the breeze. I watch it for a minute, wondering why this was the first time I'd seen this happen. I figure the breeze must have caught it juuust right to pull it away from the door and keep it flapping, so I shrug it off and go back to my book, but something's bothering me in the back of my mind. Several minutes go by while I try to focus on my book, and ignore the constant flapping and the nagging feeling that something's wrong, and finally, with a sense of growing dread, it clicks. I very slowly look up. The ceiling fan is off. My eyes snap back to the poster, which is still flapping and billowing in a **nonexistent fucking breeze.** My brain searches frantically for an explanation and hits upon the notion that the AC must be on. Then it answers its own question: *No, stupid fuck, it's fall. It's cool outside. Mom even shuts the damn thing down in summer to save money; you know perfectly well that it's off right now and won't be back on until like April.* Sure enough, careful listening reveals a total lack of the hum of the air conditioner. And even if it were on, it wouldn't blow THAT hard. Also, I never open my window - there's no screen on it, this is the south, and we have the biggest, grossest, flyingest cockroaches in the country, which I'm mortally afraid of; I'm not about to invite them into my bedroom. So the air in the room is perfectly still. And I just lie there for hours, paralyzed with horror, and watch the poster billowing in what seems to be a full breeze that doesn't exist.\n\n#3 - I'm about 16, it's a weekend morning, I'm lying in bed reading (surprise!), and I hear a loud crash from the kitchen. I figure Mom's got my brother doing the dishes and he dropped one, mentally shrug, his problem not mine, return attention to book. An hour or so later, I head to the kitchen to get a drink. Mom's sitting at the dining room table balancing her checkbook or paying bills or something, brother's in the living room playing video games. Mom glances up when I come in and asks if I heard the crash earlier. I'd already forgotten about it, but that reminds me. She looks a little disturbed, but otherwise calm, as she asks if I remember the big white ceramic bowl she uses for some soups and things. \"Yeah? Is that what he dropped?\" (gesturing to brother) Turns out he didn't drop it. He was sitting right where he's still sitting, right in front of the video games, and Mom's still at the table, when she sees a blur of movement out of the corner of her eye and the bowl hits the floor in the middle of the kitchen and explodes into a million pieces. She points to the spot on the floor where it hit. It's at least 3 feet from any flat surface, and about 5 feet from where the bowl had previously been sitting at the BACK of the counter next to the sink. **What the fuck, yo...** No explanation was ever found.\n\n#4 - Around this same age (15/16). I get home from school about 45 minutes before my brother every day, but this one day I can't find my house key and I'm locked out until brother gets there with his key. I go into a stupid adolescent rage, wrenching on the doorknob, kicking the door, slamming it with my shoulder, pounding it with my fist. Pointless because nobody was home, but the door was a great place to take out my anger. It was really thick and heavy, possibly oak or something along those lines, and nothing I could do would make a difference. After ten minutes or so of this, I slouch around to the back of the house and grow increasingly frustrated by the fact that we have burglar bars and I can't get in any of the windows, so I angrily latch the gate back behind me and head around to the front to try to force the doorknob and beat on the door some more. Several minutes later, I'm tired and defeated, and I slump down against the wall next to the door to wait for brother to get home, allowing my backpack to slide off my shoulder and thud to the ground. On its way down, it lightly brushes against the door...which promptly creaks open. My eyes bug out, the hairs stand up on the back of my neck, and I instantly launch myself away from the door and out into the yard, half-crouched and ready to sprint away if someone appears around the door frame. Nothing. I tentatively call out, \"Hello??\" No answer. After several minutes of this, I (foolishly) edge toward the door, emboldened by the fact that nothing bad seems to be happening. Eventually I work up the nerve to actually GO INSIDE (how fucking dumb was I? There could've been a murderer lurking in there!), and I grab a butcher knife from the kitchen and search the house from one end to the other. Totally empty. The door is still locked from the inside.\n\nEven all these years later, thinking of all these things gives me the creeps. I would really like to know what the hell is going on, that we live in a world that produces insane, inexplicable events like what I'm reading in this thread. Everybody just kind of...accepts it. I mean, we have to, I guess. What else can we do? We note that something really off-the-charts weird took place and then we still have to go to work and school and do the dishes and stuff, so this whole bizarre slice of life gets filed in the \"No Idea\" section and we just keep it moving. I would really love to get some answers for a change. Although I'm paradoxically afraid of what they might be, so then again maybe not. lol\n",

        "text": "This has happened twice - the first time was when we first moved in about 13 years ago, and the second time happened last night. \n\nMy mom and I were watching TV in the living room (it was the Simpsons Halloween episode where Maggie is an alien, if it matters). At about 11:30, she went to bed. Her room is upstairs on the opposite side of the house. Normally if I need her and she's in her room, I have to go stand right in front of her bedroom door in order for her to hear me because she's slightly hard of hearing. Also, unless the TV is on full volume, you can't hear it from her room.\n\nLess than 15 minutes after my mom went to bed, she texted me asking what I needed. Confused, I replied I didn't need anything and asked what she meant. She told me she heard me call out \"MOM!\", clear as day, as if we were in the same room.\n\nWe were the only ones in the house, and aside from The Simpsons on TV, all was quiet. It really freaked her out and she's convinced it's a ghost or something ridiculous. Anyone have an explanation for this?",

        "text": "Pretty sure I experienced some sort of time glitch the other day. Sorry in advance for this being kind of long.\n\nMy wife works downtown and commutes on the train, and once in a while, when I have the day off, I’ll get the train and meet her downtown after she leaves work so we can get a nice dinner. Our apartment is really close to the train station since it’s only about a 6-7 minute walk. So the other day we planned to meet downtown and I gave myself plenty of time to get to the station - the train came in at 2:37, so I left at 2:20, because I’m a little bit anxious and always give myself plenty of extra time just in case. While walking, listening to music on my ancient ipod video, a tiny weird thing happened; I glanced up at some point and I noticed an older gentleman with a briefcase walking towards me. That’s not the strange part, of course, since many commuters live really close to the station, but after a minute I notice he never passed me on the street. It was like he just disappeared when I looked away. It was jarring to me, but I reasoned with myself he must have turned somewhere and I just hadn’t noticed, or ducked into the car wash or dog groomer’s, which are the only stores on the street between my apartment and the station. But then the train pulled up to the station. I was too far away to run, and the train was technically in my way since I needed to get to the other side of the tracks to board, so I slowed to a stop, dumbfounded. My phone told me it was 2:37, so the train was right on time... but there’s absolutely no way in the world it’d take me 17 minutes to walk to the station. After a baffling second I realized I must’ve left at 2:30 instead of 2:20 or something. I turned around, feeling stupid, and sat on a bench to send an apologetic text to my wife for missing the train before walking back home.\n\nWhile walking back, the gentleman with the briefcase passed me. He was walking the same way as me now, so I didn’t see where he came from. I didn’t really pay attention, but for some reason when he got ahead of me, he glanced back and made eye contact with me, and he seemed really anxious, like I had frightened him (which would be funny to anybody who knew me, since I’m the most unintimidating person in the world - I’m extremely short and not exactly athletic looking). When he looked away suddenly something struck me as just... feeling extremely weird. Something felt very off, very wrong, even though I couldn’t come up with a reason. It was a disorienting feeling, like when you wake up very suddenly and take a few seconds to figure out what’s going on. I was walking on autopilot still, and I realized the man was gone again, although that wasn’t too strange since I’d just passed the commuter parking area. After another couple of minutes I got to my door, but right as I was pulling out my keys I heard the blare of a train horn. I turned around and watched another train inbound for the city that had just left the station. I whipped out my phone and... it was 2:37. I also had a text from my wife, although I hadn’t heard it, and all it said was “??????”. When I opened it up to reply, I read my last text. Well, last three texts, all sent with the same timestamp (2:37, of course). I’d written, \n\nsorry, I left late like a dumbass and missed the train! D:\n\nsorry, I left and escappe\n\nwhat the hell is happening to me\n\nI remembered sending the first one, but the others... I have no explanation at all. I sent another text to my wife, basically just telling her something bizarre had happened but I didn’t understand what. After that, time moved perfectly normally. I have no explanation for what happened. There’s no way two inbound trains would be one immediately after the other like that, and what’s up with the texts?? The freaked-out-looking gentleman?? I was really anxious and weirded-out the rest of the day, and if I think about it too hard I feel a little sick. My wife was really good-natured about me missing the train, probably because she could tell how disturbed I was about it. “Escappe” has become a bit of an inside joke with us now, actually.",

        "text": "So, this happened a few years ago but it still bothers me. I was in college and I was still pretty new to being there. Having been busy working full time and going as a student full time, I didn't really get to see most of the campus, besides the parts I needed to be in. But one day I had some free time so I decided to wonder around. The campus is really nice, all brick walls and warm brown decor, making it feel very \"home-like\". \n\nWell I saw this coridor that had some plastic on it, draped off to hide the hallway. But, I decided I wanted to be a bit curious and see what was going on in there. So, I went into the hallway and saw the half-finished hallway. There weren't any workers which I thought I was lucky for. There were random large white plastic sheets over some of the doors to classrooms not built yet. And when I went down the hallway and it turned left and had another plastic drape leading to another section, I got a really bad and sick feeling in my stomach. I felt really scared and turned around and promptly left. I waited for the bus (public transportation), when I got home and told my boyfriend about it he thought it was cool. So we decided to go try to look at it together the next day.\n\nWhen we got there, we couldn't find it anywhere. Nothing was in the middle of being built. We must have asked 4-6 people (friends/employees) and no one knew what we were talking about. The experience still bothers me because I remember it so vividly and I don't know what could have happened to me. It's mostly just funny/awkward to think about now.",

You know when you hit a wall in a video game and your character has the running animation, but your character is still in one spot? That's what it looked like. I thought my eyes were drying up again (which they often do) so I did a couple blinks to re-see what I thought I did. Then, I noted that she was significantly closer than she was before, talking to her friends. It's like she lagged behind and then she caught up with herself a few seconds after being stuck in an endless jog. It was very weird and I'm not sure if it was a glitch or if I was just very tired.

Everything was going normally, we rode in a cab, got a hot dog from a street vendor, and I was having the time of my life. Finally, we were on our way to the legendary Time Square. We get there and I was amazed, I couldn't breathe I thought it was so cool. All of the screens and lights, it was mesmerizing. We had just gotten done visiting Toys R Us and my family and I were walking around the center where the big red bleachers currently reside. Again, I was mesmerized by this place and couldn't help but look around. I turned my head towards the very center of Time Square where the cabs were going by only to see the street silent. \n\nMy family and the rest of the city was walking and moving like nothing was going on but I was frozen in place. In the street were 5 black clad figures all standing in a line facing me holding hands. I stared fixated on them and they refused to move just as I did. I stood there for what felt like 5 minutes when in actuality it must have been 3 seconds, staring at these figures. My mother broke through the crowd enveloping me and said \"come on,\" so nonchalantly. By the time I looked back to show my mom what I was so stunned by, they were gone. I have searched high and low since then for a movie that has been shot in NYC to see if what I saw was just some elaborate film take. To date I have found nothing of the sort and nothing was on the news at the time, as well.\n\nTo this day I still don't know what I saw and still wonder what those people could have possibly been doing.\n\nTL;DR - When I was 8 I was walking through time square as a kid and saw 5 people dressed in black holding hands staring at me and I was the only one who noticed them.",

        "text": "A friend of mine died in 2010. I have had two dreams that make me feel like he's been reaching out to me from the beyond.\nThe first dream\nI'm driving down a familiar road, approaching a fork in my path. I stop at the fork, and get out of the car. The left path that I would normally take is changed. Instead of a paved road, it's a dirt road. The road to the right is paved. My friend walks up to me from the dirt road shaking his head. He seems disgruntled. He is forcing me to take the paved road convincing me that I don't want to go down the path he's on. He walks back down the dirt road, and I wake up.\nThe second dream\nI'm at a packed house party. I'm annoyed because whoever invited me is nowhere to be found. I'm surrounded by a sea of estranged faces. It felt like I was wandering through this crowd for days. I climbed stairs, explored all the nooks of this house looking for a familiar face. Lo and behold I come face to face with my dead friend. He's got a smile on his face, and I'm sure he can see the relief I have on my face, as I've finally found someone that I know. \"Hey dude! How long have you been here?\" I ask him. Without missing a beat, my friend, serious but sly with his demeanor, says, \"How long are you gonna be here?\" The grin on his face is the last thing I remember before I wake up. I'm convinced that it was more than my subconscious acting out. I felt my friend's presence. It's eerie, but exciting. I can't wait to see him in another dream.",

My mum, dad and I were visiting Universal studios in LA, and we were standing in the long queue for the Transformers ride (bloody awesome ride might I say). \n\nAs we were standing there, bored out of our minds, a group of eastern Asian people were standing a few feet away and they reminded me of a friend I'd made the previous year (she's Korean by the way). This girl was very deeply troubled and my friendship with her had been brief, but my mum was aware of my knowing her and of her conditions. All of a sudden she asked 'oh, how's that friend of yours, -insert girl's name- ? Is she doing ok?'. It was completely random and really caught me off guard. Some of you may be thinking that it was the group of Asian people that triggered the same thought in my mum, but she never met this girl, nor did I tell her she was Korean, nor does this girl have a foreign-sounding name. So the moral is my mum is psychic and I'll be afraid of lying to her for the rest of my life.",

When I was a freshman in high school one day walking down the hall to go to the bathroom during class there was somebody ahead of me also going to the bathroom. I didn't take much notice of him because I didn't recognize him. He went in about 5 second before I did and I caught the door as it closed behind him, but to my amazement there was nobody inside. I flipped shit and checked both stalls to find no sign of anybody. I'm absolutely SURE that saw somebody ahead of me and that they opened the door and walked in. So either a ghost went to take a shit the same time I did or there is some secret exit that I don't know about. Anybody else have something like this happen?",

I decided to lay in bed and retrace my steps as best as I could.\n\nIt was Tuesday morning around 5:30 and it was raining. I live in SoCal, I can't forget the day it would rain. Also I knew that it was Tuesday because I was being picked up to go to practice and I only go to practice on tuesdays and thursdays, I also clearly remember it didn't rain on thursday. I even looked up weather reports of the past week.\n\nWell I remember that I was making my friend wait long because I was looking for my keys, I ended up taking a spare set that looks nothing like my original ones. That's how I know for sure that I lost my keys Tuesday morning. \n\nAfter practice my girlfriend came home with me, I clearly remember that it was that day too because we wanted to hang out on a day it would rain but we were bummed out that the rain had stopped and the sun came out. It was time for her to leave and I decided that it's best not to make her walk so I decided to drive her home.. this is the weird part though. \n\nHow did I drive her home? I only have one key for my car that is hooked up to 3 other keys and it was lost, but that means that I clearly had my keys even though I had lost them in the morning. This would mean that I had lost my keys, then found them, then lost them again, but that doesn't make sense because there is no way that you'd forget that you lost your keys TWICE, I only remember losing them once and never finding them again.\n\nSo when did I REALLY lose my keys?\n\nIs this a time loop? Did I experience the same day twice with two different things happening but my brain merged them incorrectly?",

Though this experience isn't exactly scary or a big event, I am most definitely weirded out.\n\nI had a busy day so I went to bed early, and for once I fell asleep pretty quickly too, however I found myself waking up and feeling very hot despite it being cold tonight and only having a thin quilt. Of course I ignored it then and just kicked my quilt off and thought nothing more of it, turned over and checked the time. 11:34 PM.\n\nI definitely wasn't going to stay up all night so I turned over and went back to sleep without my quilt. Next thing I know I'm waking up to find everything totally silent, and because I live in a busy area it's usually only quiet between 3 and 5 am. So, to decide if it was worth getting up I turned over to check the time. 11:34 pm. Now this was pretty strange because I had definitely been to sleep, so I checked the time on my tablet to see if the clock was messing up and it said the same. After this I shrugged it off as a weird dream and went back to sleep.\n\nThe next time I woke to cars and people, so it was either still night time or past 6 in the morning. I check the time. 11:34 pm on my clock, my watch, my tablet and my iPod. So by now I'm starting to freak out and go for a cigarette and I specifically made sure to check the time before I tried to go back to sleep which was 12:47 am on all my devices and my watch.\n\nI went back to sleep, and I'm now here typing this at 12:10 am after once again waking up at 11:34 pm.\n\nI've tried to think of how this could happen and I really just can't. I thought maybe I dreamt it but not only is it much too vivid for that but I don't see how I could dream this and manage to actually wake up at exactly 11:34. I'm kind of scared of going back to sleep right now. Does anyone have any idea what's going on???",

Half way through the dinner I needed to take a piss. So I leave for the washroom and begin pissing at one of the only two urinals in the washroom. Another gentleman comes in and starts pissing at the urinal beside me. At the end of my wiz I'm doing up my belt as most of us do...  however, I notice that my shirt is all scrunched up in the back, so I reach behind and try to fix my shirt.. and all I can feel is a hard object rolled up like utensils in a napkin at the bottom of my shirt.... So I unroll my shirt where the object is and I grabbed it and held it up as I'm still standing at the urinal. The object was a fork! The guy next to me was just looking at me in peculiar way trying to comprehend why I just pulled a fork from the bottom of my shirt....\n \n So I went back to the table where my family was with the fork in my hand, my dad asked why I came back from the washroom with a fork.. I told him I have no idea and I explained what just happened to me. My family laughed and thought it was as strange as I did. So I then decided to analyze the forks in the restaurant to see if they had the same design as the one I found scrunched up in my shirt. The forks in the restaurant where all completely identical, very generic and simple with no pattern. The one in my shirt had a simple design of flowers engraved in it. So I'm assuming it didn't come from the restaurant....\n\nFlash forward one week and I'm at my buddies house sitting at his table. My buddy is eating Kraft dinner with a fork... A fork that matches the same design as the one I found scrunched up in my shirt a week prior. It turns out he has a set of these forks in his drawer. So I tell him that I think I have one of his forks and I tell him this ridiculous story.\n\n The really strange part is that I didn't go to his house at all the day of the incident. And I wore that shirt the entire day! Was the fork in my shirt the entire day? Was it just a fork from the restaurant that happened to get lost in my shirt? Or is that particular shirt a one way portal for utensils from my buddies kitchen? Il never know.",

The first time this happened was when I put a single mint in my pocket from a candy dish that was located in a clinic lobby. I ate the mint and put the wrapper in my pocket to throw away. About 5 minutes later, I feel something weird in that same pocket, so I reach in there and I find...the exact type of mint in a plastic wrapper. I shrugged this off as just some weird coincidence at the time, but then coins started popping up. Everywhere. I've had a dime appear on my body while I was in the shower. I thought it was some sort of bug that landed on me so I freaked out, slapping the spot where I felt this weird sensation. A dime fell off into the tub. I've had a penny roll out of my shirt, taking me completely by surprise, at least 3 or 4 times in my life, and I will often see random coins on my floor that weren't there just 20 minutes before.

An image came across my screen of the episode that I immediately recognized from a dream I had when I was eight years old.

It was Christmas Eve and my family and a family friend had all gotten home from mass, and we were just sitting in our living room having fun, eating food, and spreading Christmas cheer. I believe the topic of my great grandma had come up a few minutes prior, but out of nowhere this santa statue, only about 2 feet high with a bell on the tip of it's hat just started jingling. Now I had left the room at that point and was in the room just next to it, but I heard the jingling and so did everyone else and they said it came from the santa. The statue was indeed just a statue, no jingling animations or batteries or what have you, just a statue that was intended to stand still. I'm not sure if the hat had actually started moving back and forth or if it just jingled, but I distinctly remember it and it has sorta bugged me for a while, especially since I have a feeling my house definitely has some weird stuff going on in it. Nothing major, mainly just hearing things at night and seeing things in the corner of my eye, but I always had sort of a weird feeling about the house. Any explanations or similar experiences?",

My pjs consist of an old boyfriend's big tee and my gym (wishful thinking) shorts. These shorts are just some thin shorts with built in undies. No pockets or anything else.  \nHere is where it gets weird. During a commercial I got up to get a drink and I heard clinking. I looked down and saw a dime, a quarter and two pennies. I thought nothing of it and went to get my drink. I finished it and got up to throw it in the sink when I heard the same clinking. More change!! Three dimes, a quarter and 4 nickels. I thought it was weird and picked up the couch cushions to see where the change was coming from. I couldn't find anything other than dog hair and some old goldfish crackers. I got on the floor and picked up all the change, looked under the couch to see if I could find more and threw it on top of the blu ray player.  \nThis kept happening and I even checked my shorts (and undies) just in case there was a pocket I'd forgotten about. This happened for about 2 hours before I headed out to pick up my dog from my aunt's house. I got there and hung out for a bit. When I got up from her couch, she pointed out the change that had fallen. I told her what was going on and she didn't believe me. I hopped up and down just so she could see/hear that I had no change in my clothes. About 20 minutes later as I got up to leave, more change had fallen. At this point, I've got more than 4 dollars in change that seems to be falling from my nonexistent pockets.  \nWhat's going on?? ",

I got worried, because both cats not using the bathroom in 24 hours isn't good.  \n\n I told my son I was going to have to call the vet since they aren't using the bathroom, and he gave me that teenager *Parents Are So Stupid* expression and said, \"Mom, you cleaned their boxes about an hour ago.  I saw you do it.\"   I had no memory of doing it, but he still insists he saw me clean the boxes an hour earlier than usual.  \n\nI checked the bathroom trash and there was a black litter baggie in there.  Only one, and I take the bathroom trash out every night so it wasn't left from the day before.  My son wouldn't have done it; he'd rather die than clean the litterboxes.

        "text": "Today I was telling a friend about my parents being upset with me, because they saw me take my dad's leftovers. I didn't actually do this, and they're still in the fridge. It made me realize that this happens to me *a lot*, and my friend suggested I come here to see if it's ever happened to anyone else.\nFrom their point of view, I'm sure it'd seem like most glitch-type stories: They saw me do something or go somewhere, but it turns out that I didn't. I'm not sure how common it is to be (a part of) the glitch itself.\n\nSome of the more interesting examples:\n\n* Around 1st grade: My class was doing a project in the library. When we were finished, we could go back in the classroom and do Independent Study aka fuck around. I finished and I went back in and played Oregon Trail with a few other kids. About 15 minutes later, the teacher came into the classroom. She said while another student was the (girls') bathroom I ran in crying, and got the teacher because I wasn't supposed to be in there and it seemed like I was hurt. But when they went back, I'd gotten up and was walking back into the classroom. I was completely fine, and had never gone into the bathroom. The kids I was playing with vouched that I hadn't left since I came in and hadn't been crying, but the teacher and several students outside the classroom had seen me leave, go in the bathroom, and walk back out.\n\n* More around middle school: I stayed home from school because I was sick. The next day, my math teacher reminded me I had lunch detention with her. I didn't know I did so I asked why, and she explained she gave me detention for being disruptive in class yesterday. I said I wasn't at school, but she insisted I was, and called my best friend in. He verified we'd both been disruptive in class but only I got detention because he'd gotten in trouble fewer times than me. I had to spend my lunch in the attendance office proving to my teacher that I was never at school in the first place. \n\n* High school: I borrowed Shadow of the Colossus from a friend, and I kept it for a while longer than I meant to. I remember saying something like \"Shit, I really need to remember to bring your game back, I'm sorry.\" But she'd said I'd given it to her the day before. I shrugged it off, but when I went home, I saw the game sitting on top of my PlayStation, disc still in it with her name written inside. I called her and said I still had it after all, but she told me I definitely gave it back to her the day before, and she was playing at that moment. She held the phone up to her TV so I could hear the music. It's extremely unlikely she got a new copy - her family was constantly nuts to butts being cardboard box poor. \n\n* About a year ago: I was in a hotel room with 3 other people for a convention. I woke up early because I wanted to be the first to shower. The hotel had thin walls so while I was in the shower, I could vaguely hear the other people wake up and talk, and then I heard the door out of the hotel room close as someone left. I finished up and came out of the bathroom, but saw all 3 people looking at me like I was a ghost. They said I woke them up because I was and leaving to go get Starbucks and did they want any? Brushing it off as a prank, I went to do it anyway because it sounded like a good idea. When I got to the front of the line, the guy behind the counter commented \"back already? I thought you just left.\" He even remembered my name. There's no way my friends were able to get out of the hotel and to Starbucks and back in time for me to get out of the shower.\n\n* Few weeks ago: My car battery died, and my cousin gave me a ride so I could buy one. He said he'd just wait in the car because I'd be in and out. I went in, bought the battery, went out... And he was gone. I was pretty pissed and called him a bunch of times, but he doesn't use his phone while driving. When he finally answered he was confused - he didn't ditch me, I came out of the store, got in his car, and he had dropped me off at home. \n\n* Tons of more minor/boring stuff, like someone seeing me walk into the kitchen when I didn't, my neighbors seeing me leave the house when I didn't, etc. I usually don't think of it - it's normal to me at this point. However the \"bigger\" incidents have upset two of my friends (both of which were in the hotel) enough that they've stopped hanging out with me. \n\n**TL;DR: I am the glitch.\nHow common is this? Have you ever been the glitched person?**",

And it's not like when I'm expecting a call I'll just keep thinking about it until I get it; I usually forget for awhile, then abruptly remember (often when I'm focused on something else) and then my phone will vibrate with the expected call. It happens to me all the time. Lately I can't remember a time where I've been expecting a call and it NOT happen. When I'm not expecting a call but am just thinking about a person is not as common, but still happens fairly frequently. What do you guys think?

Every night, there are at least one or two apartments across from me that will flick their lights on and off repeatedly for a few seconds at a time, then stop, move to a different room and do the same thing. There is one apartment that continuously does it and several others we have seen sporadically. It looks as though they are sending morse code messages, but I find this highly unlikely. Also, that would mean there would have to be people in *my* building doing it back, as the people I see flicking their lights cannot see each other. \nOut of curiosity, we have flicked our lights on and off back at these people when we notice them doing it on two separate occasions. Each time, they have stopped, the person has come outside onto their balcony and stood there perfectly still for 5-10 minutes until we get too freaked out to watch anymore and closed the curtains. \nA friend of ours thought it may be children, but it happens very late at night (usually 1-3am) and we can see the figures in the window occasionally and they are definitely adult.\nI know there has to be some sort of logical reason for this weird behavior.

That was a really long time ago.\n\nIt can't be a prank, me and one other person know how to access the database backend and she doesn't know how to do anything other than hand the keys to whoever they hire to replace me in the event I get hit by a bus.\n\nI'm so confused right now.\n\n**tl;dr: Fired employee was not actually fired, I apparently never did the things I remember doing to the database to lock him out after his non-existant termination.**",

        "text": "Hey everyone. This is my first time posting on reddit, and I'm not quite familiar with it, so... Forgive me in advance. I just felt like I needed to share my experiences. \n\nMy whole life I never really felt right. When I was a little kid, I was always thinking that I was special or had powers, and as I grew up I dismissed it as a childish desire to feel like I was important [I've struggled with depression my whole life]. \nI've always known some things without ever having had to ask what they were, like suicide, and oddly enough the menstrual cycle. This didn't seem like any big deal to me until recently, when I realized nobody taught me those things by the time I knew them. I also always considered myself superior to my classmates, in mentality and maturity aspects. I started picking up on my actual kinds of abilities when one of my teachers was pregnant and I knew that the baby was going to be a boy. This happened with a few other people, and I was right every time. It turned into other things as I got older, like having dreams about things before they happened, or long impending feelings of something to happen. \nMost strange of all are the memories I have. Not past-life memories or anything [although I have some of those], but things that happened that I just remember, even though they're insignificant. I remember little details from any span of time back that seem completely random, but eventually, with every one of them, something happens that makes my memory seem relevant, and like I had a purpose for remembering it. Things like seeing a dead bird and getting a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach [note that roadkill is common where I am from, but dead birds aren't usually visible. I feel like I'm not meant to see them, and when I do, I feel like it's a bad omen], or disliking a certain part of town and avoiding it for whatever reason. Even little things like a line of dialogue in a video game or a lyric in a song I just can't get out of my head. \nThese memories won't have any effect on my life, but then something will happen, and all of the sudden, it all seems to make sense. Like when you're watching a movie, and a bunch of unrelated foreshadowing shows up that you don't realize even happened until the high point of the film. \n\nHere's the biggest example I can think of... \n\nWhen I was really little, I was in the car with my family. We were pulling into the driveway, and I saw a hawk swoop out of a puddle with a limp, dead robin. I remember getting chills and thinking of how sad and desperate it made me fell. \n\nSome time later, maybe months or maybe years, I went snooping around in my brother's room, like all little sisters do. I stood on some books and reached up onto the highest shelf, where I found a noose tied in strong rope. I froze and put it back where I found it, and never told anyone it was there. I guess I was too scared to think about it. \n\nA few years later, my brother went incognito. He wouldn't talk to our family or visit us, and no matter what I did, I couldn't get a hold of him. No cell phone, no note, no nothing. His apartment was vacant, left a mess, and my mom and I went to clean up after him. I had this sinking feeling that I was going to open a door and see my brother hanging, or with his wrists slit in the tub. \n\nHe just wasn't there, though. Eventually he showed back up, but I worried so much about him that I was angry, and refused to see him for a long time. When I did see him, I ran up to him and cried, then hugged him tight because I loved him so much. \n\nLater on, I moved. When I lived in an old house with my parents, the place always bothered me. The person who lived there last up and left, leaving all his belongings and furniture behind. I asked my parents why, and they just said \"We don't know. He just left. He probably couldn't pay rent.\" I kept prying over the years until my dad said, \"I told you, he just left. Do you want me to make this scary for you?\" \n\nThere's a hallway closet in that house that leads to the attic. I always hated that hallway in particular. It made me feel lonely and isolated. I never went in the attic, and I tried to avoid going in that hall in general. I'd take the long way around to avoid stepping through it. \n\nYears later, I moved and started a new life. One day while I was driving home, I saw a dead blackbird. It made me feel uncomfortable and I didn't know why. I'd gotten news that my brother had stolen from my parents, and I was very angry with him, so I didn't speak to him. Eventually I got a call from him, which was unusual, because he didn't often call. We had a great happy conversation, and when we hung up, I didn't think anything of it, except that I couldn't stay mad at him. A week later, I saw a dead dove in the same area I saw the blackbird. I got horrible chills, and went home. \n\nNot an hour later, my parents called me and said that my brother had killed himself. \n\nHe'd hung himself in my parent's house. \n\nIn the same hallway I always avoided. \n\nHe secured the rope in the attic I never wanted to go into and then he dropped down and died right there. \n\nIt was like everything and nothing suddenly made sense. It was like I knew all along the signs that he was going to die, and how he was going to do it, and where, but at the same time I never knew. \n\nThat's just the most prominent example. There have been other things like it, but that one is the most raw and recent, so it's the easiest to think of. \n\nIt can't be just a coincidence. There's no way that all of these things would just \"accidentally\" keep resurfacing in my mind until the day my brother killed himself. It can't just be a placebo or something. I have always felt some sort of underlying difference, and I want to know why it is that I can feel these things coming up on me without any warning. \n\nIt really puts me into some stressful times trying to figure it all out on my own... Is there maybe someone else who has similar experiences out there? Memories that don't connect until something bigger happens? Or gut feelings that are always right, no matter what? How can I learn to cope with these? What should I do with this knowledge that I'm different? \n",
