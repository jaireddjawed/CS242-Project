        "text": "Once upon a time, there was a small, isolated town named Millfield,  surrounded by dense, foreboding forests. The town was infamous for its  strange happenings and the eerie darkness that consumed it every night.   \n\n\nOne day, a young woman named Mary moved into the town, eager to escape  the memories of her past and start a new life. She had heard stories of  the strange goings-on in Millfield and was eager to experience them for  herself. But what she found was far more sinister than she could have  ever imagined.    \n\n\nMary couldn't resist the urge to explore the forests, despite the  warnings of the townsfolk. As she walked deeper into the darkness, she  felt a sense of unease that grew with every step. Suddenly, she heard a  voice, and she turned to see a figure shrouded in darkness, advancing  toward her.   \n\n\n\"I am the Guardian of the Forest,\" the voice boomed in her mind. \"I am  here to warn you that the darkness is not what it seems. It is a portal  to a world beyond our own, a world of terror and despair, where you will  never return.\"   \n\n\nMary was terrified, but she couldn't let go of the hope that she would  finally find peace in this strange world. She begged the Guardian to  allow her to enter the portal, promising that she would never reveal its  secrets to anyone else.   \n\n\nThe Guardian reluctantly granted her request, and Mary entered the  portal. She was transported to a world beyond her worst nightmares. The  sky was blood-red, and the ground was covered in a thick, sticky  substance that she quickly realized was blood.   \n\n\nAs she walked, she encountered creatures of unspeakable terror, their  twisted bodies and razor-sharp claws a testament to their insatiable  hunger for flesh. Mary tried to escape, but she was pursued by these  grotesque beings, who seemed to sense her fear and revel in it.   \n\n\nAs she ran, Mary stumbled upon a clearing, where she was confronted by  the Guardian of the Forest. He told her that she must leave the world  beyond the darkness and never return, or she would be consumed by the  horrors within.   \n\n\nBut Mary was unable to resist the lure of the other world and she  returned, time and time again, each time experiencing even greater  terror and violence. Eventually, the creatures caught her, and she was  horrified to see that they were not just mindless beasts, but beings  that enjoyed the suffering of their prey.   \n\n\nThey tore her limb from limb, feasting on her flesh and drinking her  blood. Mary's screams echoed through the darkness, a warning to all who  dared to enter the portal.   \n\n\nYears passed, and the town of Millfield was consumed by a darkness that  no one dared to enter. The townspeople whispered of the young woman who  ventured into the portal and was never seen again, and the Guardian of  the Forest stood watch, a silent reminder of the horrors that lay beyond  the darkness.   \n\n\nAnd as for Mary, her soul was trapped in the world beyond, forever  doomed to suffer the horrors that she encountered there. Her final  thoughts were of regret, and a longing for the peace that she had sought  but would never find. Her blood-stained bones lay scattered across the  ground, a warning to all who dared to enter the portal and face the  horrors that lay beyond.   \n\n\nThe darkness of Millfield was a reminder that some things are best left  untouched, and that there are forces beyond our understanding that we  should fear. The portal remained, waiting for the next unsuspecting soul  to enter and suffer the same fate as Mary. And the Guardian of the  Forest stood watch, a silent warning of the horrors that lay beyond the  darkness.",

        "text": "Freaky thing that happenes to me doing some semi primitive backpacking \n\nTheres another thread for spooky trail stories but i cant post this in there for some reason, but i had already gone to the trouble of writing it out so i thought id put it up as its own thing. \n\nThis actually happened to me when i was a fair bit younger, but a while back i was solo backpacking on an unfamiliar but really lush, kinda twisty little backcountry trail. I was using a lot of gear i had made from natural stuff, and it was early summer so i didnt have any hunting licenses and i didnt have agun or anything with me. Literally just a short celt i had made and a couple flint knives.  I had had a really nice couple days of my trip and i was encountering nothing but pleasant weather, peace and quiet, and nature in all its glory. Then, on the third day, after i broke for lunch, i noticed movement on the trail behind me. I was carrying a lot of weight in a home made triangle frame pack as a strength building exercise and i wasnt going all that fast. I thought at first it was a hiker so i made a little effort to slow down to let them pass but they never seemed to catch up. Eventually that started to become irritating, amd that was when i started to notice the movement just off the trail behind me. \n\nIt was staying behind trees and bushes and around bends and i couldnt make out what it was. Its silhouette was indistinct and it was staying behind cover, couldnt get a square look at it, but the more i looked at it, the more it looked wrong. The torso was weird, too long, no waist, and i couldnt make sense of the glimpses i got of the head. The legs were extremely spindly, and the arms were hunched up or something, or tented in fromt of it or something. This was mostly on clay, and trails can be hard packed ground on clay, almost drum like, sometimes you can really here the thump of a footstep, but these were just eratic, and so loud. Like slamming a stick down onto the dirt. \n\nI called out to it a few times, let it know the time for jokes was over, knock it off a few times. Whenever i spoke or yelled it would just get quiet. Everyonece in a while there would be a crashing sound from back around where i heard it and a bunch of the thumps, and i kept thinking it was chargin me, but then nothing, and a while later id hear it again from a ways back. \n\nThis lasted the full rest of the day, and by the time i was breaking for camp i was starting to be pretty freaked out amd pissed off. It was quiet while i set up my tarp and got settled and as dark fell. I threw some stones behind me, mostly to settle my nerves, and it was silent, so i figured whatever it was was over. When i cooked my food, i heard a few very rapid, very loud thumps from a ways behind me and then silence. I was frozen over my dinner for a few seconds, and i could feel my heartbeat in my eyes. I looked back and put my flashlight beam through the bushes for a few moments and then pretty high, like, taller than i was expecting to look for eyes, i saw two retinas reflect back up and then a bunch of thumps and crashing and a weird gasping, whistling breathing sound, but like it was going into a big space in a big chest. Kinda high pitched? from the distance i heard kind if a gagging cough. \n\nI didnt get any sleep that night, i just sat with my back to a big tree and with means of defending myself in my lap. I was not feeling good in the morning but coffee got me up and running, and i didnt see or hear any more sign of it for a few hours. \n\nI had been going west, kind of at an angle to the wind, and the trail i had to switch to started going north, with the wind on my back. That was when i started to smell something awful, and i realized that i must be smelling it, because it persisted no matter how long i walked. It was rancid. Rotting flesh or something equally gag inducing, paired with a kind of musky stink. Ive got a strong sense of smell, very strong, and it was making it hard to breathe. Not too long after i smelled that i statred to hear the rustling behind me again and the weird loud faltering foot steps. I still had no idea what it was, i kept getting  glimpses of it but couldnt make out color or anything definite. Could have been grey, or brown, or patches of reddish brown. Never got a clear enough look at it. \n\nI was really freaked out at this point and i decided, stupidly to charge at it a little to see if it would take off. I stomped and rushed the bushes a little  and i heard the rapid thumps and crashing again, and then silence again for a while. I am not ashamed to admit that it had freaked me out for long enough that i decided it was just time to put distance between me and it and i took off down the trail at a fair jog, despite the weight of my pack. I got clear of the stink for a bit, and well, i had run too hard and my body decided it was a great time to vomit, so i did. I took a breather for a while, and then started to really drag ass to my next watering spot, a little brook, and it was no fun at all. Took me most of the day to get there and i ended up skipping lunch because i didnt want to stop. \n\nI ended up deciding to set up camp closer to the water than i usually do. I was determined to get some sleep ,but still freaked out so i decided to do something i wouldnt normally and i set my hammock up really really high. liks around 4 or 5 feet off the ground, with my feet a little lower than my body so i could roll out and land on them. i ate my food as quickly as i could, and then climbed, best as i could into my hammock and tried to be as still as i could. I started to doze off almost immediately. An important detail is that i keep my pack on another tree with my pncho over it and my bear locker in a food bag even further away hanging in a tree.  It had been drizzling for a few hours at that point. \n\nI dont know how long i slept before i was woken up by this bizarre plasticy drumming sound. Really really loud, paired with the bizzare thumping and weird breathing  and the stench was back big time. It took me a moment to come to and then i was in full fight or flight. The noise was so weird. Inhad one of those little inflatable lanterns hanging off my hammock so i flicked it on and i could kinda vaguely see around me, the bushes and stuff. As soon as the might went on, the noises all stopped  Silence, long enough for crickets to start up their bullshit again. Then rapid steps and the thing popped through the foliage into the little area i had set up my tarp and hammock and i could see it  more clearly for the first time, it was long torsoed and thin legged and moved lurchingly, weird too big head apparently peirced through with a branch or something and lolling, arms apparently outstretched in front of it and i could see its eyes reflecting back at me, greenish yellow. I got that much of a glance and dropped down to the grojbd in my bare feet wiyh my hatchet in hand. When i looked abck up i finally recognized it. \n\nIt was a mule deer buck, covered in sores and dirt and skeletally thin, stumbling around on its hind legs and going from tree to tree snapping at leaves(?) or aomething that that werent there. Its breathing was super ragged and weird and its head was loosely floppy on its neck, and as it got closer to me it fell down, making the crashing sound it had made before and then struggled back up. When it noticed me it froze, pissed a bunch, and then took off into the bushes. I wouls have laughed if i hadnt been so releived and tired. \n\nI went to inspect my food bag and it looked like i hadnt tied it wellnor high enough as it was down leaning against the trunck of the treeand it had had the ever loving shit kicked out of it, there were bent and scuffed bits all over my bearlocker. \n\nI figure it must have had CWD or something, but christ did that fuck with me. I marked a few spots with aricks pushed into the mud so i could find the tracks in the morning, dried off and slept for a few hours. \n\ni ended up searching around the place for a while in the morning and it had already been muddy as i was putting up my shelter. \n\nHeres the thing: i found deer prints from where it had come in and left, but outside my clearing, from the direction i had heard it coming i only found one print, a lot smaller than my feet, (im size 11 and flatfooted) with a high arch and only three toes, and it was in deep, deeper than my prints. No other tracks that i could find. \n\nI caught the rotting meat smell a few more times on the way back. I was supposed to go two days further in and then turn aorund and i decided to just head back to my car. I actually heard the thumping as i was getting back to where i parked and i ended up hustling the rest of the way.  I skipped aleeping the next night and just walkes through the night by flashlight. I kept hearing things, too. \n\nI havent hiked on that trail since, if im being honest.",

        "text": "Quick preamble; Myself, Liz, Sam, Ruby and Gavin had an idea to open a cafe. Think warm lighting, endless cup-o-coffee specials, high top and low top tables, pillows, music at the perfect level... not too loud not too soft. Cozy with a capital C. \n\nBecause we all live in a suburban strip mall culture desert, there's a real need for a non-corporate place to hang out, study, read a book. \n\nThe plan was to call it Cafe Orion. That was my idea. No particular reason other than it sounded cool and was easy to imagine spending hours, day after day there. If you've ever tried starting a business and open a shop you'd know it's probably one notch below actually going to visit all the stars in Orion in terms of difficulty. \n\nI was the idea guy and fundraiser. Liz was our business lead and fundraiser, Sam knows real estate and fundraiser, Ruby is design and fundraiser and last but not least Gavin, the chef, and the only one of us with restaurant experience... and fundraiser. \n\nAnyway, strip mall city. The independently owned stores went away decades ago. But the economy being what it is we found a space pretty easily. What we didn't know till we started the demo was it used to be a novelty, joke, magic shop. We found boxes of old gags and magic tricks. Detachable thumbs, little magic wands, joy buzzers, the three ring hoop trick and of course... itching powder.\n\nMost of it was in pretty bad shape, there had been water damage at some point, but the itching powder was perfectly intact. \n\nI can confess, prior to discovering this curioso I hadn't the faintest idea what itching powder even was. I had to look it up online. I was curious but also maybe it was valuable on ebay. What I discovered is that it's actually made from an exotic blend of plants and roots and ground down into a concentrate. Put it on your skin, and itch. But when I saw the sky high prices on ebay, some as high as $300 a gram, I wanted to know why. Turns out most of the ingredients have a very limited shelf life, but the primary ingredient, mucuna pruiens, is much more stable and when taken alone produces a brief intoxicating effect. The way to tell if it was 'active' was to put some on your skin. If it doesn't itch, it's potent. So we dabbed some on the back of our hands and nothing. \n\nI'm thinking we sell it, it's not illegal, put the funds towards Orion. That's when Liz said, \"I dare you to try it.\" \"Uh, no. I'm not taking some weird drug that I don't know what it's gonna do or even how to do it.\" Then the drips of water started coming down from the ceiling. It was storming outside. I hadn't even noticed. We knew there was minor roof damage to be repaired but at least the mystery of how these long forgotten magic tricks were damaged was solved. They were right under the leak. \n\nWe retreated to the front of the store where Sam and Ruby were well on their way towards making a huge junk pile in the center of the room. The contractors were due tomorrow but time is money and anything we can do to save time saves us money. \n\nLiz and I put our work gloves on and started tossing debris into the pile. We did this for a few hours until everyone agreed it was time to call it quits. The storm wasn't letting up so we decided to grab some take out from next door and wait for the storm to pass.\n\nExhausted we all sat on the ground stuffing our faces, talking about our vision for the coffee shop. That's when Liz mentioned the itching powder. Fascinated by the possibility that this quaint novelty children's prank could be some form of intoxicant had everyone intrigued. Of course they started goading me on to try it. \"No. Freaking. Way.\" Looking back I have to admit I was a teeny bit curious. That's why I did what I did. At least that's what I think I thought. All I know is Liz, Sam and Ruby would not shut up about it. \n\n\"Fine.\" I pulled out the bag. Re-opened the cellophane, dipped my finger in the coarse powder and snorted it right up my stupid nose.\n\nThe look of shock everyone had. Shocked that I took the dare. Shocked that I snorted it. Why not just taste it? Maybe because it was a powder. I don't know. \n\nSilent and blinding, lightning hit the transformer outside, then the loudest boom I've ever heard. All the power went out. The only light coming through the store front windows. The transformer was spitting out sparks and smouldering. \n\nWe walked up to the window for a closer look. The smell of ozone was dizzying. Liz looks at me and her face snaps to a face of concern. \"Shit. Are you okay.\" \"Yeah.\" \"Your arm.\" The entire length of my left forearm had a series of deep scratches. Blood flowing... it didn't hurt... but it itched. It itched bad.\n\nThe last thing I remember was Sam and Ruby pinning me down. \"Stop it. Stop scratching.\" \"What the hell is wrong with you?\" \"Liz, call 911. It's an allergic reaction.\" \n\nThat's the last thing I remember about that night.\n\n\"On a dare I snorted expired itching powder... I don't know what else to say.\" One thing I can say, as I lay here strapped to a hospital bed, 62% of my skin scratched off, in some places down to the bone and feeling the most wicked itch, like the kind just out of reach and no matter what you try nothing makes it go away, like having thousands of mosquito bites all at the same time... one thing I can say is who the fuck is paying $300 for this on ebay? Unless of course, it was a practical joke. In that case you got me. You got me good. And if I can ever get out of this bed, this hospital and make this itching stop. I'll be sure to pay you back in kind.",

        "text": "I've  always been good friends with one of my cousins, Cole, who's the same age I am.  The two of us  were...not quite inseparable, but we always did get along very well together, and were often found together, both in school (as we'd always wound up in the same class together throughout elementary school) and outside of it.\n\nWhen we were 12 and in the 6th grade, I was hanging out with Cole on a Friday afternoon around the later part of of May, and we were psyched at the start of the weekend.  We'd wound up at his house, since he  didn't live too far from me, and at one point my mom called to say that our grandpa was in the hospital.  While the issue with our grandpa wasn't expected to be life-threatening, he was being kept at the hospital overnight for observation, and both my parents and Cole's were planning on staying with him and grandma at the hospital (since my mom   and her sister were the two of their sibling who lived close by).  I was told that I was given the OK to stay at Cole's house for the night,   with Cole's 15 year old brother Hunter being \"in charge\" while our parents  were out.\n\nThis was fine  by us.  I got along well enough with Hunter, and he was never the bossy older brother/cousin that some of my other friends said they had to put up with.  We ordered out for pizza, and enjoyed goofing off as boys  that age tend to do.  At around 9 or so, there was a knock at the front   door, and Cole went to answer it.  I was a bit curious as to who it  could be at that time of the night, and so I watched from a ways back.  At the door were two older guys.  They said that they were with the  city  and that they were investigating reports about the water pressure supposedly being bad in the neighborhood.  They asked Cole if his  parents were home, and when Cole said they were \"unavailable\" at that moment (which we were told to say to strangers if our parents weren't home) the guys started asking a bunch of questions about how the water pressure was in the house and if they could come inside to check.  Hunter came over at that point and politely told the guys that the water  pressure was fine and perhaps they should move on to check on other homes in the neighborhood.  The guys seemed reluctant to leave but turned and walked away after Hunter started closing the door.\n\nAfter the door was shut we looked at each other and shrugged, but didn't think too much of it after that and went back to goofing off.   Eventually, we decided to go to bed.  Cole and Hunter shared a bedroom, and we all agreed that I'd sleep in there with them, rather than me  hitting the sack on the couch or something like that, so that we could  talk while we fell asleep, and Hunter grabbed a sleeping bag out of their camping supplies for me.  When we got into their bedroom, they stripped  down to their briefs, and I remembered Cole had mentioned to  me once a while back that they had started sleeping in just their underwear.  Since I hadn't originally planned on staying the night, I  hadn't  brought anything with me from home as far as overnight stuff,  but since I wasn't in the mood to sleep in my clothes, I stripped down to my briefs as well, though I felt a bit embarrassed, even though we  were all guys there and I knew they wouldn't say anything or be  judgemental.\n\nThey climbed into  their beds and I quickly crawled into the sleeping bag, and after talking for a while about random stuff we eventually fell asleep.  Early  the next morning I got up because I had to pee, and so I quietly got out of the sleeping bag and went and did my business in the bathroom.  On the way back to the bedroom I heard something in the family room, which was on the opposite end of the house from the bedrooms and particular bathroom I was using.  I didn't pay too much attention to it   at the time, thinking it must be either Cole or Hunter, until I got back into the bedroom and realized that both of them were still in  there.  Trying not to panic, I woke them and told them that I thought  someone  was in the house.  They quietly followed me, and the moment we walked into the family room we saw the two guys from the night before in  there,  and it was rather clear they were robbing the place.  One of them started moving towards us as he pulled out a wicked-looking knife.\n\nThe three of us promptly raced to the front door, somehow managed to get it unlocked and open, and we fled outside.  As luck would have it a cop was driving by at that particular moment.  We quickly flagged him down and told him about the two guys in the house.  The cop called for backup, and within a couple of minutes several other cops were there, and they proceeded to enter the house, and after some searching they caught the two guys.  The cops figured out that the two guys must have   entered from a window in the laundry room that had a broken latch, and had probably targeted that house because, while it wasn't empty, they'd probably realized that there were no adults there and figured that if we discovered them, we could be more easily dealt with than adults.\n\nTo add insult to injury, while we were waiting outside while the cops searched the house (both to get the two guys and make sure that there was no one else with them), some of the neighbors came out to see what the commotion was about, and this included some kids who went to the same school as Cole and me, including a few who were in our 6th grade class with us.  It was during that time that the three of us realized that we'd never had the chance to get dressed, so, just like in the stereotypical nightmare, we had to stand outside in full view of everyone in just our briefs for what seemed liked forever before being allowed back inside.  When we went back to school on Monday, Cole and I had to put up with more than a bit of snickering, stares, and ribbing for the next few weeks until school ended for the summer.",

        "text": "As a child, I had a strange and terrifying experience that still haunted me to this day. It started at a Red Lobster restaurant where I was having dinner with my family. I excused myself to go to the bathroom, but when I caught a glimpse of my reflection in the mirror, I saw something that I couldn't explain.\n\nAt first, I thought it was just my imagination playing tricks on me, but then I saw it again. And again. Each time I saw this mysterious figure in the mirror, I felt a cold hand squeeze my heart, and I couldn't shake the feeling that something was watching me, waiting to reach out and grab me.\n\nI tried to ignore the strange figure, but it seemed to follow me everywhere I went. I would hear a whispering voice calling my name in the darkness of my room, causing me to wake up in a cold sweat. I would see things move on their own, toys falling off the shelves, doors opening and closing, and shadows appearing and disappearing. The fear was constant, and I could never shake the feeling that something was always watching me, waiting to reach out and grab me.\n\nIt wasn't until I was at a friend's sleepover that I had the most frightening encounter. We were playing hide-and-seek in the basement when I heard a strange sound that seemed to be getting closer. I turned around and saw a figure standing just inches away from me. I couldn't see its face, but I felt its breath on my neck, and I heard it whisper my name. I screamed and ran, but the figure seemed to follow me, growing closer and closer. I never went back to that house again.\n\nTo this day, I still didn't know what that figure was, but the fear it instilled in me as a child had stayed with me all these years. I could still feel its presence, hear its voice, and see its shadow. I didn't know why it chose to haunt me, but the memory of that strange encounter was burned into my mind, and I would never be able to forget the terror it brought into my life. Was it a ghost? A monster? A demon? I still didn't know.\n\nAnd yet, I find myself drawn to write this story. It is as if an unseen force is urging me to put these events into words, as if by doing so, I might finally understand what happened to me all those years ago. But as I write these words, I can't help but feel like I am being watched, like that figure is still following me, waiting to reach out and grab me. I don't know what will happen when I finish writing this, but I can't shake the feeling that I am about to uncover something even more sinister and frightening than I could ever imagined. I will keep everyone updated if anything else happens. I have doubts though. It's been years.",

I blinked my eyes rapidly, attempting to build up some moisture behind their lids and focus on where I was. It wasn't until I attempted to stand up that I understood how serious my situation had become. \n\n  The second I felt my wrists, ankles, and chest trying to pull free from the chair I was bound to, my wavering consciousness practically collided with the reality of my dire circumstances.\n\n  While the room was mostly dark, I could see slivers of light shining from somewhere behind me. As I fought to pull my extremities free, tearing my flesh against the course, leather straps in the process, I felt my chest tighten all the more when I noticed I wasn't alone. \n\n  \"James!?\" I said, far louder than intended, as I was still unsure if my captors were nearby. \n\n  Seeing his bruised, swollen and bloody face hanging limp where he sat, bound in the same manner as I, I feared the worst. \n\n  \"Goddamnit, James, wake up!\" \n\n  I was still trying to keep my voice low, but with the panic fueling my thundering heartbeat, that was no simple task. When my best friend began to stir, slowly shifting his body, I felt my lungs deflate from the grateful sigh. \n\n  \"Denny? What's…what's going on?\" he said, lifting his head, his bones crackling as he straightened his posture, \"what!? What the hell, man!? What's…\"\n\n  \"Shhh! Keep your voice down. Just cool it, man. We gotta figure a way outta here.\"\n\n  \"What is this?\" he asked, darting his head around, wincing at the likely pulsing pain of his half-shut, swollen eye, and bruised jaw.\" \n\n  \"Do you remember anything? How you got here? Who kicked your ass?\" \n\n \"Shit…I dunno, man. I was at home…no. No, someone was inside. I went to the kitchen and something hit me. Knocked me out cold, I think. That's all I remember before…oh God!\"\n\n  When dim lights flickered to life above our heads, I started fighting harder to break free, but the straps were so tight, I couldn't even hope to get loose. I could tell that James was of the same mindset as me when a door creaked from behind, the glow from the other room casting elongated shadows across the floor. \n\n  \"Calm down, honey,\" Rainey said as she strolled around the chairs we were bound to, the waiter from the restaurant coming around the other side, \"you're gonna hurt yourself.\" \n\n  \"Let us go, you crazy bitch!\" \n\n  \"Watch your damn mouth!\" the tall man said, slugging me across the jaw.\n\n  \"Cool it, Ricky,\" the psychotic woman said, laying a hand on his shoulder as he reared back for a second swing, \"don't mess up that pretty face too much.\" \n\n  He just growled as he backed up, taking his place by her side. Though I hadn't paid much attention to his appearance at the restaurant, I could now make out a certain similarity between my two captors. The same dark complexion, black hair, and large, emerald eyes. \n\n  He was a good half a foot taller than her, even with the heels she was wearing, but twice as wide. Though he was still dressed in that white shirt, tie, and black vest, I could see the muscles bulging beneath the fabric. Of course, given how hard he hit, it was no surprise that he now seemed a veritable beast of a guy, rather than the friendly and almost awkward waiter he was playing the part of. \n\n  \"You sure this is the guy?\" he said, his words lined with hatred, \"he looks weak; feeble, even.\"\n\n  \"Oh yeah. He's the one, for sure,\" the pretty brunette said, her unblinking eyes cutting right through mine. \n\n  \"What the hell is this, Rainey!? What are…\"\n\n  \"What did she see in this asshole?\" the big guy said, completely ignoring my words. \n\n  \"He is kinda cute,\" Rainey said, \"she was always a sucker for the cute ones.\" \n\n  \"Who're they talking about, man?\" James asked, still battling against his own straps. \n\n  \"How the hell should I know? They're batshit; these two. How the…\"\n\n  Another swat from that wide fist stuck a fork in my attempts to rationalize the actions of the crazy people of the world; something that left my already thumping head spinning. This hit felt twice as hard as the last, my eyes crossing from the impact. \n\n  \"Son of a bitch!\" James spat, \"let me loose and I'll show you a real ass-kicking!\" \n\n  The laughter that erupted from the duet of lunatics revealed more of their shared madness. The anguished and hate-filled expressions transformed into something I can only describe as maniacal; their wide eyes and gaping mouths drooling as they cackled, slapping their knees while gagging from the howling chuckles. \n\n  \"That was good…you're funny,\" the large man said, wiping tears from his eyes. \n\n  James glanced over at me, his expression matching the bewildered look on my face. It wasn't until this point that I just knew we were going to die here. These two were not remotely of sound mind; something that assured me they would not be simply letting us loose after a few well-aimed sucker punches. \n\n  No, they were on a mission. There would be no abort code freeing us from this, even if my partner in crime wasn't trussed up next to me. \n\n  \"Just let us go,\" I begged, my eyes welling up with the reality setting in. \n\n  \"Yeah, we didn't do anything!\" James added, his voice croaking, \"we won't tell anyone about this. Just let…\" \n\n  I was as shocked as my friend as Rainey's laughter suddenly stopped cold, her hand moving so quickly as she struck his face, neither of us saw it coming. \n\n  \"YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!?\" she screamed, the veins visibly pulsing at her temples as her eyes widened so much, I thought they might spring free of their sockets any second, \"YOU THINK YOU'RE INNOCENT!? DO YOU REALLY HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA WHAT YOU TOOK FROM ME!?\"\n\n  I was stunned; frozen in place, even if I had the ability to move anything but my head. The rage-filled expressions confronting us were paralyzing to look at. We all just stared at each other in intense silence for what felt like minutes, though the passage of time was not exactly something my erratic thoughts could comprehend at that moment. \n\n  Rainey was breathing so heavily while her dead stare was locked with that of my closest friend, while I cut my eyes between the three whose company I was forced to share. The bulky man wore a cold expression as he blinked from me to James, back and forth like a pensive pendulum. Strangely, his calmer demeanor was just as terrifying as his companions' more hunched and almost feral posture. \n\n  When she moved in, slapping my friend again, following with another strike, and yet another, back to back, over and over, I almost tipped my chair to the floor in my attempt to reach him. \n\n  \"STOP!\" I yelled, her hands still swatting back to back. \n\n  Blood spurted from the mouth and nostrils of my closest friend, spraying across me and to the floor. Left, right, left, right, the hate-fueled palms attacked his face, his lips attempting to utter words in between, only succeeding in muffled yelps at best. \n\n  \"Please, just stop,\" I whined, praying that my more sympathetic tone would warrant some manner of compassion. \n\n  \"That's enough, Rain,\" the man said, lightly gripping her left wrist as she reared back for the umpteenth time. \n\n  For the briefest moment, her rabid gaze met his stern eyes, to which he tilted his head in a questioning way. Her rage faltered. Her expression softened. She wrapped her fingers around his, taking a step back from the bloody mess she had made. \n\n  Though she did no more slap James, the sheer volume and strength behind her attacks left both of his eyes swollen shut, his nose bent to one side, spewing blood, and his lips puffy and split. He was still trying to form words, but only gargles and muffled coughs were breaching his mouth. \n\n  \"James?\" I said, tears streaming down my face, \"please be okay, man. We're gonna get outta there, I promise! Somehow, we'll…\"\n\n  \"No,\" Rainey said, tidying her hair, \"you won't.\" \n\n  \"You really don't know, do you?\" the man said, \"you really don't know what you did…what you took from us?\" \n\n  \"I…I don't! I don't know either of you! I've never seen you before…I…\"\n\n  \"No,\" the mad woman said, \"but can you really say we don't look even a little familiar?\" \n\n  \"Huh? How can…\" \n\n  I felt my words catch in my throat when the big guy pulled his wallet from his back pocket, fishing a picture from within. I instantly recognized the girl in the image, who most certainly reassembled what I now assumed to be her siblings. \n\n  \"Do you even remember her name?\" Rainey asked, visibly trembling from head to toe. \n\n  I just nodded, praying to God that this would be enough. \n\n  \"Say it!\" \n\n  \"Um…Lu…Lucy,\" I said, my confidence faltering. \n\n  \"Try again,\" she said, reaching behind her back, pulling a long, thin, serrated blade. \n\n  \"I…I don't…please don't do this…\"\n\n  \"SAY IT!\" she screamed, pointing the dragger at my friend.\n\n  \"Oh, God! Please don't! I'm begging…\"\n\n  \"FUCKING SAY IT!\" \n\n  \"Christ! Le…oh God…Lenore?\" \n\n  James and I screamed in unison as she drove the tip of the knife into his upper thigh, spilling crimson down his leg in an instant. \n\n  \"STOP THIS! FOR GOD'S SAKE!\"\n\n  \"SAY IT!!\" \n\n  \"I DON'T REMEMBER! OKAY!?\"\n\n  As she pressed the edge of the blade against my still whimpering friend's midsection, his leg gushing blood to the concrete floor, I knew she wouldn't listen to reason, but I had to try. I could feel the thundering in my chest practically bouncing the fabric of my shirt like a kid on a trampoline, my guts churning from the thought of what may happen next if I couldn't come up with something to make this stop. \n\n  \"Look, this is on me, not him, okay? Please don't hurt him anymore! Whatever you need to do, do it to me! Just, please…just let him go, I'm begging you!\" \n\n  The light reflecting from the silvery blade flickered on the soft illumination from above and beyond, panning across me as her arm dropped back to her side. \n\n  \"I don't remember her name, and I'm so sorry for that. I'm an asshole; a piece of shit womanizer. I get that, but that's on me, not him. I know…I know I humiliated her, and I would be more than happy to make it up to her in any way she sees fit, but…\"\n\n  \"She's dead,\" the man said, his voice quivering, \"can you make that up to her?\" \n\n  I swear I felt my heart stop at those words. My thoughts were all over the place. Yes, I made a fool out of myself and her, just to get away, that night, but it was one date! How can I be held responsible for this after spending, what, a few hours in her company? \n\n  As much as I attempted to convince my lips to utter these very words, I was stunned by this revelation, as well as everything else this night had shown me. Finally, after regaining my ability to speak, I asked the question that still haunts me. \n\n  \"How…how did she die?\" \n\n  \"She killed herself,\" Rainey said, holding up the blade still dripping my friend's blood, \"with this.\" \n\n  \"Oh, my God! Why? Why would she do that? Why did…\"\n\n  The knuckles of the waiter put a quick end to my words, leaving my head spinning once again. \n\n  \"Because of you…because of what you did to her,\" he said, wiping my blood on his shirt. \n\n  \"Me? We just met for the first time that night! I mean, we'd been texting for a while, but we were just having fun! How can I..?\" \n\n  \"She was a fragile girl,\" Rainey said, her eyes glistening, \"she always had been. You weren't the first to leave her high and dry, but you were the last. She was so humiliated when she got home, I couldn't even hope to calm her down…\"\n\n  She rubbed her eyes, trying to sniff back the tears. Her brother put his arm around her, attempting to console her, but his tears only fueled hers. \n\n  \"She ran off to her room, but I tried to follow. She yelled at me to leave her alone, so I hoped she just needed a little time…time to let it roll off her shoulders. It wasn't the first time some heartless bastard had left her in tears, so I thought…I thought she would be alright after a while. When I went to check on her a little while later…it…\"\n\n  The floodgates opened, transforming the confident and rage-filled woman into a sobbing, wailing child before me. I felt my chest burn from what she told me, as well as the sight of my captors spilling tears upon one another. \n\n  Yes, her sister was a bit of an odd one; way more unsettlingly enthusiastic than she had seemed over text, but I would never wish this on anyone. When James responded to the first stage of our abort plan, she pretty much guilted me into sticking around. \n\n  Everything inside me begged me to get going, but she seemed so broken when I told her I had to go; that there was an emergency and I had to get to the hospital. I thought she was just being dramatic, practically bursting into tears when I said I had to go. When I caved and decided to stick it out, she was even more clingy than before. \n\n  It was maybe thirty or forty minutes later when James showed up at the bar, as I had not sent the all-clear text. We acted out our ridiculous scene, turning every eye to us, but I didn't fully pay attention to my date, only played my part to run away like an insecure teenager. \n\n  I can see it now; that image I had not registered at the time. The sight of that poor girl looking so crushed by what we were doing. When I turned to give one last look before I darted out of there, I could tell that she could see through our pathetic performance; that she understood I went to such lengths just to get away from her. \n\n  Can you imagine what that would do to someone, even one who wasn't already a little disturbed? \n\n  \"I'm so sorry,\" I said, my eyes refusing to meet theirs as I spoke genuinely for the first time since I met the beautiful girl with the raven hair, \"I swear I never meant to hurt her…to hurt Lacey.\" \n\n  I can't say when it was that I remembered her name, but it caught the attention of the crying siblings before me. \n\n  \"I'll accept whatever you need to do; whatever you see as fit punishment. I've spent so long thinking about only myself, I never took the…\"\n\n  The gunshot that echoed through the room, almost deafening me, took a second to fully register. Again, I felt frozen, mentally checking myself for wounds, when I looked up to see which direction the revolver was trained. \n\n  I felt my eyes trace the waiter's shoulder to his wrist, to the hammer of the pistol, to its smoking barrel. When my gaze followed that course over to the gaping hole in the forehead of my closest friend in this world, the shock would not so much as allow me to scream out. \n\n  \"Now you can feel what we felt…\" the man said. \n\n  \"What it feels like to lose someone you love,\" his sister finished. \n\n  No more words were spoken after that. No further punishment was given. No more hateful looks staring down at me. When the needle pierced my arm, I continued to just glare at the leaking corpse of my dearest friend, his vacant gaze being the last thing I saw as my consciousness drifted into darkness. \n\n  When I awoke in my bed, it took me some time to put together everything that had occurred, along with how much time had passed since I left my home. Discovering that three days had gone by since I left out for that ill-fated date, I wasted little time in reaching out to the police. \n\n  They would find no proof of the existence of Rainey Barnes, nor her siblings, for that matter. The restaurant doesn't even have any records of someone fitting the description of the waiter who served us that night. Witnesses recall overhearing some awkward conversation, a waiter helping an apparently drunk guest and his humiliated girlfriend out to their car, but nothing that would hold up in court. \n\n  There wasn't even any luck tracking down the guy who hooked us up in the first place. Apparently, he had been working under an assumed identity, having quit his job the day of the fourteenth. Whether he may have been another sibling or someone else entirely, I'll likely never know. \n\n  Upon inspecting the house I spent just as much time at as my own, they would find it empty; its owner having seemingly vacated over the past few days. James didn't have much in the way of family; neither did I, for that matter. Perhaps that's why we grew so close over the years. There was nobody to reach out to, nobody who may know where he may have gone. Nothing. \n\n  The facts being as they were, all the police could do was file a missing persons report. Whether anyone believes me or not, I know what happened on Valentine's day last year. While I've considered looking for the duo who ripped my life in two, I feel there's no sense in it. \n\n  What's done is done. I told them I would accept their punishment for my actions, and perhaps they simply called my bluff on that. At the end of the day, it's like they say: all's fair in love and war. I suppose it's only right that I finally end up on the losing side of that argument. That was probably long overdue, all things considered.",

        "text": "My first memory is a strange one, and I think I'm ready to share it. This happened sometime in the year 2000. I was 4 at the time, and at the age of 4 I didn't like sleeping alone. So I would either sleep with my parents or I would chose to sleep with my big sister. This particular night I decided to sleep in my sisters bed. My sister was around 14 at the time and her bedroom was decorated with 90's singer/ band posters, polaroid pictures of her and her friends, Christmas lights hanging from the ceiling, etc. ( This is important later) My sisters bed was placed in the corner of the room up against the wall. Whenever I would sleep with her she would have me sleep on the side of the bed that was up against the wall so i wouldn't roll off. Now that you have the layout of the room, let me get to my first memory.\n\nI remember waking up one morning and opening my eyes. The second I opened my eyes, I realized that I have no memory. I started to panic and cry while yelling \"I DONT REMEBER ANYTHING! I DONT REMEMBER ANYTHING!\" My sister woke up and immediately tried to comfort me. I remember her telling me \"Its okay! You just need to wake up all the way!\" She kept trying to calm me down and tried to reassure me that i just wasn't fully awake yet. After about a minute of this panic i noticed that my sister had gone quiet. I looked up at her and noticed that she was looking out into the rest of her bedroom. I followed her gaze and was in disbelief at what we saw. Her whole bedroom was torn apart. All the posters were torn off the walls. All of her photos were tossed around the room. Her christmas lights were torn off the ceiling and laying on the floor. All of her perfumes and lotions that were on her dresser were scattered on the floor. As i was looking around I noticed that there was even pictures and stuff laying on top of us on our blankets on the bed. It looked like a tornado went through the room while we were sleeping. My sister asked, \"Did you do this?\" But it was clear that I wouldn't have been able to. I was too small to reach most of the stuff on the walls and dresser. Let alone reach the lights hanging from the ceiling to rip them off. After a minute of silence my sister said, \"Maybe we had an earthquake.\" We lived in Utah at the time and didn't ever really have any big earthquakes. My sister took my hand and we went upstairs to see if the rest of the house was destroyed as well. When we got to the top of the stairs we saw our parents cooking breakfast in the kitchen. We looked around and the rest of the house was in pristine condition. My sister asked my parents if there had been and earthquake. They replied with no and asked what was wrong. They saw that I had been crying and that my sister looked like she had just seen a ghost. My sister explained to them everything that just happened. They went down and saw my sisters bedroom and nobody had any explanation other than maybe my sister slept walked and destroyed her bedroom? But there were items laying on top of us in the bed? My sister had never slept walked before or after this so I personally don't think that she did it. My parents and sister didn't really pay any mind to my memory loss. I think they believed that I was just being dramatic.\n\nTo this day, I have no memories before that morning. The only way that I can explain to you how I felt in that moment is; it felt like someone gave me a new identity. It felt like someone gave me a binder with pictures of a random family and a house. It felt like someone told me \"This picture is of your new mom. This is a picture of your new brother and sister. This picture is of your new dad, and this is what the layout of your new home looks like.\" I remember looking at my family and thinking \"I know that you're supposed to be my family but I don't have any memories with you and i have no emotional connection to you.\" It took me a couple weeks to get use to the memory loss. I remember 2 friends came over to play after the incident and I knew their names but i didn't remember ever playing with them or even meeting them for that manor. I eventually gained an emotional connection with my family and friends. But it does still freak me out thinking back to those couple weeks. My sister still remembers that day and talks about how strange it was.\n\nThe only explanations I can think of are that maybe I hit my head too hard while playing or something the day before? But that doesn't explain my sisters bedroom being torn apart. Or there's something more creepy/ paranormal going on. I have taken an Ancestry DNA test and I'm 100% my parents kid. So being placed here by aliens is out of the picture lol. But I'd love to hear more explanations if anyone reading this has any? &lt;3",

        "text": "I've always been fascinated by abandoned places, the remnants of forgotten lives and memories. So, when I heard about the old abandoned asylum on the outskirts of town, I couldn't resist the urge to explore it. I had heard the rumors, of course - the whispers of strange noises and ghostly apparitions - but I didn't believe in such things. I thought it would be an exciting adventure, a chance to see a piece of history up close.\n\nBut as soon as I stepped through the rusted iron gates, I knew I had made a mistake. The air was thick with a sense of foreboding, and the creaking of the old wooden floors echoed through the empty halls. The wallpaper was peeling, and cobwebs clung to the corners of the ceiling. But it was the stains on the walls and floor, dried and brown, that truly made my heart race.\n\nI tried to shake off the feeling of unease and continued down the hallway, my footsteps ringing out in the silence. The rooms were empty, the furniture long gone, but the atmosphere was suffocating. It was as if the walls were closing in on me, and the whispers of the past were all around me. I was tempted to turn back, but my curiosity got the better of me.\n\nI finally came to a large, open room, with a single, rickety chair in the center. I approached it cautiously, and as I reached out to touch the armrest, I heard a voice whisper in my ear, \"Don't sit. Don't sit.\" I stumbled back, my heart pounding in my chest, but there was no one there.\n\nI knew then that I needed to get out of the asylum, but the door was locked, and the windows were boarded up. I was trapped. The whispers grew louder, and I could feel the spirits of the past surrounding me, closing in. I stumbled through the dark, desperate to find a way out, but every door was locked.\n\nAnd then, I saw her. The ghost of a young woman, with long, tangled hair and a sad expression. She reached out to me, beckoning me forward, and I followed her, driven by a desperate need to escape. She led me to a door that was slightly ajar, and I squeezed through it, my heart in my mouth.\n\nThe ghost was gone, but I was finally free. I stumbled out of the asylum, gasping for air, and collapsed onto the grass. The sun was just beginning to rise, casting a warm glow over the world. But I couldn't shake the feeling that the asylum was still watching me, that the ghosts were still there, waiting for their next victim.\n\nI never returned to the asylum, but the memory of that place still haunts me to this day. I know I was lucky to escape, but I can't help wondering about the others who entered that place and never made it out. I can still hear their whispers, echoing through the halls, and I can still see the ghostly face of the young woman who saved me. And so, I know that the abandoned asylum will always be a place of fear, of horror, and of death.",

        "text": "This has been going on for as long as I can remember. Every night, after my parents are asleep, I hear it. A dark, twisted version of my own voice, taunting me. My parents say they can't hear it. Over the years, I have cried, begged and pleaded with them to believe me. On the nights I'm not completely frozen with fear, I go to their bedroom and beg them to come to my room and listen. The times they relent and come with me, the taunts turn to weeping. They still insist they can't hear anything. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \nI have torn my room apart, looking for any evidence that something is or has been in there, but I find nothing. On nights where I've been particularly disturbed, my parents have made a show of checking my wardrobes and drawers for me, and nothing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \nI have been in therapy since I first started complaining of all of this, every therapist I've had has told my parents I either have an overactive imagination, or that I am suffering from night terrors. Whichever they put it down to, they tell us that I will eventually outgrow it. I turned 16 yesterday and I can see my parents are growing increasingly concerned. I know I won't outgrow this, what is happening is real, but no one will listen. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \nThe reason I'm posting about it now is, its presence is growing stronger. My earliest memories of it, the voice was very low and weak, it sounded muffled almost like it was behind a closed door. Each time I'd start feeling comfortable enough to ignore it, the voice grew slightly louder and clearer. It tells me that I don't deserve what I have, that I owe them my life and that it is unfair I get to live. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \nSix months ago was the first time I heard it scream, loud enough that it sounded like it was right in my face. The fear I felt at that moment was almost physical, like my body sank below the earth and my brain was trying to climb its way back out to safety. It screamed at me that it was their turn. That was the last I heard of it that night, but it has only exacerbated since then.   \n  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week ago was the first time I saw it, I thought I was hallucinating at first due to the lack of sleep. I was getting ready for bed when I thought I saw something behind me in the mirror, I turned but nothing was there. I got into bed, switched my lamp off and was scrolling on my phone when I thought I could see a shadow above me. I put my torch on and looking down at me was my own face, but it was... not quite right. I tried to scream but it got caught in my throat. The face looking back at me flashed a twisted smile and said “wow, you can actually see me now.” I scrambled out of the bed and sprinted to my parents' room, screaming through tears that there was someone in my room.   \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents came to my room to check and said they couldn't see or hear anything, but it was still there. I was hysterical, pointing and screaming at it. They were telling me there was nothing there and trying to calm me down. This fake replica of myself was now standing in the corner, completely ignoring me and looking at my parents longingly and crying. I felt like my head was going to implode from both fear and frustration, how could they not see it?! It was right there in front of us!   \n  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI slept on the floor of my parents room that night. The next morning at breakfast, my parents said they were worried as that was the worst they had seen me. I tried to plead with them again to believe me but, they insisted they couldn't see it. They said that my current therapist obviously isn't working as this is getting worse, not better. I stormed out and went to school early.     \n  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver the last week, my parents have been obsessively googling and calling clinics to try and find a specialist that can help me with my “condition”. They've made me stay in my room each night as they're concerned about “feeding the delusion”. It has been a nightmare. I've been able to see it every night, it gets in my face and endlessly berates me. \n\n“You don't deserve this life!” \n\n“Give it to me!” \n\n“IT'S MY TURN!” \n\nAll I could do, was close my eyes and cry.     \n  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night however, was different. It was my birthday and I spent the day as I usually do. Pancakes for breakfast, went to watch a movie and in the evening my Grandparents came around for birthday cake. Once it had gotten late, I went up to my room and went through my usual night time routine. I switched the lights off and got into bed, scrolling on my phone like I always do. Not long after it began again, like clockwork. It started with singing, “happy birthday to US, happy birthday to US”, its voice dripping with hate. I switched the lamp on and there it was, standing there sneering at me. For the first time in my life I spoke to it.   \n  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI asked it what it wanted and it basically spat its words at me. It told me that it's been telling me what it wants all along. It told me that its been with me since the beginning and just because I tried to get rid of them, doesn't mean they ever went away, they will always be a part of me. I asked it what it was talking about. It said I was selfish, there was enough love for both of us, but I had to take it all for myself. I told it I'm just a kid and I've never hurt anyone. It scoffed at me and said I hurt them before I even took my first breath. I told it I had no idea what it's talking about and it rushed towards me and screamed in my face. It screamed that it's not fair, I got to live and they're stuck looking in at the life that they should have had. It said I don't deserve it, it's about time I surrendered control. I asked it what it meant and it said sisters are supposed to share.   \n  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy Mom knocked on my bedroom door telling me to turn off the light and go to sleep, when I turned back it was gone.   \n  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSisters?! I'm an only child and this thing clearly isn't even human. What the hell is it talking about? Telling me I need to surrender control, control of what?! I have no idea what any of this means and I am so exhausted. I am running out of energy to even deal with all of this. I am so scared but I almost *want* it to show tonight as I have so many questions.",

        "text": "Exactly the title. I'm being stalked and I don't know what to do. They are going to get me. It started about a year ago. I would notice these 3 men every where I would go. No matter where I went, no matter what I was doing I'd always see them at some point or another. They were never together, but always the same 3.\n\nNow as you can probably guess I have gone to the police, I have told everyone I know, and I have taken some pretty extensive measures to make sure I'm safe. From multiple locks on my doors and windows, to only traveling by a friend. Who, thank goodness, is doing their best to help keep me sane. You see she has never seen them. It's as if everytime I look away they disappear. But she believe me non the less.\n\nOver the year the distance between them and I has been getting shorter. At first they were far away enough that I could only make out the colors of their clothes, if at all. They always have on the same clothes. Now I can clearly see their clothes. The first wears a flannel shirt, blue jeans, and work boots. The second wears a button down shirt, slacks, and dress shoes, and the last wears a dirty wife beater, and jeans that look as if they are about to fall apart, no shoes just socks covered in holes. \n\nI can't understand it. Maybe it's because they have been following me so long but they seem familiar in a weird way. Like something in the back of my mind is telling me I know them, but I can't place it since I hadn't seen their faces. That was until a couple days ago. \n\nI was out with a friend to do some basic shopping, and gather stuff for a project I was doing at work. It was going pretty great until the well known, feeling of dread crept over me. I started to glance around to see where, and which one it was. There was no sign of them. I sighed thi king I had let the paranoia get to me. That was until I turned around. There stood the man in the dirty wife beater. \n\nHe was a heavy set man, that looked like he hadn't bathed in years. His head was dented in on the left side where he had been struck by something. Blood slowly oozed from the wound, and i could make out what looked to be his brains. The fear that ran through me was almost paralyzing. I grabbed my friends arm, and ran out of the store. As we ran to the car she kept asking me what was wrong, or if I saw someone but the fear kept me running. \n\nAs we made it to the car I told her what I saw. She had a look of sadness and sympathy. I turned to look out the window, and thats when I saw the man with the flannel shirt. He too, looked just as horrid as the other man. That lead me to assume the man with the dress shirt, would look the same. And I knew then why there was a sense of knowing them. I have seen them before. I screamed out for her to drive. She threw the car into drive, and we left. She had a very worried look on her face. She wanted to speak, but was hesitant. \n\n\"Spit it out already\" I told her. \n\"Are you sure someone was there?\" She asked as gently as she could. \n\"Of course there was!! Why do you think I would make this up?!?\" I yeld at her. How dare she accuse me of that. \n\"Tracy, I looked... there was no one there.\" She said once again being as gentle as she could. \n\"You don't understand. They shouldn't be here!!\" I screamed out, tears flooding my eyes, and face. \n\"What do you mean honey.\" She said with a confused look as she glanced between me and the road.\n\"This shouldn't be possible, they can't be following me.\" I cried.\n\"Please tell me what is going on Tracy, I want to help.\" She had tears and worry in her eyes. \n\"They can't be following me because I killed them. I killed all 3 of them almost 2 years ago.\"  I was now choking on my sobs, and Candice's mouth hung open. She pulled the car over quickly, and jumped out. \n\nWhy did I have to tell her that? Why did I have to ruin something so nice? Candice was my only friend. So I did what anyone in this situation would do. It's been 2 days and I haven't left my house. No matter what i do, they are at every window, and door. They are just waiting. Waiting for me to leave. Lightly knocking every few minutes. I'll look out my peephole every now and then, to be met with their dead eye stares. I dont think I'll make it much longer. I'm eventually going to have to face them.... especially now that Candice has joined in the knocking.",

        "text": "I'm standing in front of the dead, endless ocean, my feet buried beneath the black sand. The sky is a gray void, the sun is as lifeless as the moon. I'm all alone in this planet, there will be no company for months. In front of me is the Explorer Mark I, but I prefer calling it the Casket. Its titanium hull is covered in a black slimy substance, making the EM1 text nearly invisible. It has no windows, for they would crack under the pressure. It has two propellers, barely moving the submarine inside the dense ocean. The door to the airlock is open, inviting me in.\n\nThis job is hard to do, it really is. Doing maintenance on outposts, decades old with the constructors long dead. Operating rusty machinery that has been left to rot, barely working. I see the ocean in my dreams now, it doesn't leave me alone even when I'm not in its world. I hate this, all of this. But if I don't do it, who will? The only people except me who worked here are dead. While the team behind this is tucked away in their warm blankets, I'm down here and doing the heavy work, not that they care.\n\nAfter loading in my cargo which consists of supplies that will hopefully last me a year, I get in the airlock. After a quick look at my checklist and confirming everything is in order, I flip the switch and the internal door opens. The sound of grinding metal fills my ears. After a moment, the lights turn on, revealing the corpse of a metal beast, way past its prime. But it does not matter, for it has been designed for ease of maintenance and to stand the test of time.\n\nI painstakingly check every valve, every pressure gauge and every pipe. During this thing's operation, failure is not an option. After making sure everything works, I get in the engine room. In front of me is a nuclear reactor. It looks like an iron heart, its veins spreading out in all directions. After a quick test, I'm confident that it works and insert the fuel. Two hours of other maintenance later, I enter the control room. I turn the engine on and the submarine comes back to life. I release the docking lock and the submarine drops to the ocean below, sinking into the abyss.\n\nAs the casket is being lowered, I monitor each sensor, making sure everything is where it should be. After about an hour, the sub has reached its cruise depth of 12 kilometers. At this depth, nothing bigger than a bottle of water should be alive and I should be left with the sound of the engine. But that's immediately proven wrong as I hear the screech of an ungodly creature in the distance. As I put the sub in autopilot mode, I check the status of each station, hoping that at least one of them is still working but the terminal screen stays empty. No such luck.\n\nIt wasn't always like this. I used to have a crew of 5: Tanner, McReady, Roswell, Blair and me, Carter. They're all a part of this world's ecosystem now, I sometimes dream about them. Sadly, I need to cut this short, as I'm getting close to Station Roswell and I don't have much time left until all communication is cut so I'll just copy the first few entries of my journal here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n25/06/1991\n\nThis damn place is so claustrophobic. I like the metallic look of it though, it reminds me that we're isolated from whatever is out there. It's been a few days since we've arrived here and EM1 was started up yesterday. I don't know how the previous guys used this to build the stations. The pressure is about 2000 atmospheres here, it's a miracle this thing even works, considering the water here is like two times denser than the water on Earth.\n\nI don't even know where this is. The lab guys just put us in these capsule things, and when we got out we were here. I'll be here for about 7-8 months now, I'm just hoping that they can get us back because they didn't seem confident when sending us here.\n\nToday we went to Station Tanner. It was better than the EM1, but sadly we didn't stay there long. Only Tanner has access to the machinery or whatever that's going on inside. They gave each of us a station to take care of, I don't know what will happen to the stations when one of us dies here.\n\nI didn't think we were in any danger until we parked to sleep. I've heard something swimming around the submarine, I could feel the vibrations. At first I didn't think much of it, but we were all up and trying to get the sub running when the thing bumped into the sub and made a sound that's not possible to describe.\n\nI'm already counting the days until we get out of here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n26/06/1991\n\nApparently, we're in an underwater massive cave thing. I would've known sooner had I bothered to check our map but I was desperately trying to get the broken computer working which is still not entirely fixed. Guess I'll add it to the list of things to be replaced after we get out of this place. I'm being called to the docking bay, so I guess I'll write the rest of this later.\n\nWe just launched the tiny EM15 with Blair in it, he'll go to the observatory to figure out what's causing problems with our maps while we go to Station McReady. His sub is a lot faster so he'll probably keep up with us. I dread going into that thing, this place is already as claustrophobic as it is. Everyone's already on edge from that thing last night, Roswell said it might have been the ventilation system but we all know that's not what it is.\n\nWe arrived at Station McReady which is supposed to be like this data management thing? I have no idea because the big boy wouldn't tell us. Like, I get this is all supposed to be secret or some shit but I don't like being left in the dark. It's not like we're actively trying to sabotage each other's work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n27/06/1991\n\nBlair is back. The moment he got out of EM15, we all knew something was wrong. Blair was pale and you could feel his fear just by looking at his face. We asked him what happened but he just went to bed. My guy fell asleep the moment his head touched the pillow, I wish I could do that. Anyways, I've been assigned to surveying data from EM15 to figure out what causes his uh, behavior.\n\nI've looked at the data. It looks like EM15 was on its way to the observatory when the outside sensors detected close proximity to.. something. The sub stopped for a moment and the sensors went cold right after. The worst is when he made it out of the observatory and started coming back to EM1. He was halfway there when he got in a radio conversation with Tanner, I don't know what they were talking about because the EM15's inside microphone sucks ass.\n\nThen, the outside proximity sensors went off again. This time, they didn't stop and a few minutes went by with nothing happening. Then, the sub's mic started picking up chatter again. It was Tanner. Blair didn't speak back, he just stayed silent as Tanner spoke. I couldn't identify what was wrong until I realized there were no radio conversations at that time. The voice was coming from outside the submarine. \"Tanner\" kept speaking the whole way and it eventually left when he got close to EM1.\n\nWhat. The. Fuck.",

        "text": "Yes, 47 minutes ago my classmate from primary school has sent me this exact message:\n\n\"Hey! Sending this to my every contact. Could I please stay at your place? I'll answer any questions once I'm there.\"\n\nNow I hadn't seen him since primary school ended 11 years ago and I was fairly certain that our paths would never cross again. Don't think I hated him, he was just always weird. But I guessed that after so much time he must have changed. Besides everyone has tough times in life. And so I answered:\n\n\"Yeah sure you can stay at my place, here's the adress: [MY ADRESS]\" \n\nNow I've heard that he has moved hundreds of kilometers away from our small town, yet only fifteen minutes later the doorbell rang. Michael hasn't changed one bit. Long hair, small backpack, muddy hiker boots and a stained shirt. I obviously wanted to ask him about how life was going by in the decade when we haven't seen each other, but he simply said to take the small talk inside. \n\nHe said that a blue-haired guy was following him. Now, you can imagine me thinking of an accident and hearing about a blue-haired dude, then just bursting out laughing. But he was dead serious. \n\n\"I know, sounds funny. But this man who I have never met before keeps on finding me. At cafes, restaurants, in public transport and even in front of my apartment. I just feel concerned and want to get this off me.\" \n\nAs he said that the doorbell rang. I look through the peephole and I saw this guy with dyed blue hair just right outside the door. \n\n\"No way. It has to be a fucking coincidence.\" I said, to which he simply replied \"Tell me. How many people in an Eastern European country who are of the age of around 30-40 years have their hair dyed blue? And more than that, how many of them have knocked on your door?\"\n\nI stood there along with him, silently when after some time a voice echoed from beyond the door. \"Open up Michael. Or Caroline. I just want to talk.\" \nThis guy somehow also knew who **I was**. \n\nThe man began banging on the door, which wasn't made of the strongest material, since it was slightly more durable than cardboard. It began to break, and we knew that our only option was to jump from the window. While a two-floor drop was unpleasant, we fell into some bushes that softened the fall a bit. Although my foot was aching so much that I couldn't drive a car, and so Michael sat behind the wheel. \n\nNeither I, nor Michael have ever seen this man in our life before. We are theorising about what he has done to earned his fate while I am probably just the wrong person at the wrong place at the wrong time. But even now as I am typing this out on my phone I see a strange light blue car. Now if you ever drove around Eastern Europe you know that if a car is blue, it is dark blue. Yet this car that is slowly catching up is fully light blue, and I think I can see a blue-haired man behind the wheel.",

        "text": "July, 2020.\n\n[Ever since my colleagues and I became unwilling test subjects in my psychotic professor’s experiments](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10rzgln/three_years_ago_i_was_a_research_student_working/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) into awakening the supernatural, we have had multiple people trying to hunt us down. Whether they were renowned scientists desperate for the serum for themselves or random people obsessed with cutting us open and seeing how we ticked, these assholes didn’t care that we were human beings, that we were ex researchers ourselves. \n\nThey wanted us dead or alive, in pieces, or splattered across concrete. As long as they got that precious serum dripping from our frontal lobe, they didn’t give a fuck. There were varieties of hunters. Some of them tried to play nice with their own nefarious agenda, while others were completely fucking insane.  Like the ones who saw us as a mistake; a curse sent from god to end humanity as we know it. \n\nYeah. They thought we were the next coming of the Antichrist. \n\nHave you ever been stripped completely naked and forced to bathe in salt water for three days without food and water? \n\nThat is when I lost my will to fight.\n\nI still remember the sensation of flames licking at my feet, rope wrapped around my wrists pinning me to a tree. They wanted me to admit I was a monster. That I was a curse from the devil and belonged in hellfire. I’ll spend this post elaborating on what exactly our professor did to us, and the burden forced onto our backs—but I will say it saved us at points. For example, the freaks who tried to cleanse us in salt water (and then burn us under a full moon) got their comeuppance. 2020 is probably a year in your lives which didn’t feel real. \n\nYou were locked inside and you probably compared what was happening to a movie. We had a similar problem. But while you were struggling through lockdown, trying to fight a wave spreading globally, we found ourselves with bounty’s on our heads. Because we were no longer human to these bastards, and to them? Anything went. Which was bad news for our professor who had fought to keep his research as private as possible, choosing to show only a select group with shiny money bags for eyes.  It turns out, no matter how much you think you’re hiding something, it will always be leaked. And people will find out.\n\nBad people.\n\nThe kinds of people in all of my favorite movies as a kid. You know, the evil trigger-happy British guy obsessed with finding buried treasure? Him. But tenfold. I might have felt special about the multi-billion price-tag on me, but knowing all they wanted me for was to dissect and slice me apart like meat to the slaughter—yeah. I can’t say I was thrilled to have so many people after our little group. 2020 was the year when people stopped being human. Stopped trying to be human. All morality down the drain. \n\nOf these certain groups trying to capture us, there was a specific one which I will always remember. Seth’s gang. I’ll remember them because it was the first time I realised my colleagues and I weren’t human anymore, and maybe the freaks trying to label us as The Devil’s Children were right. There were a lot of people after us, as I said. But Seth and his gang, however, just wanted us for the sake of gloating. After hearing of our professor’s experiments, these guys decided they didn’t want the serum, or the research. \n\nThey just wanted us. For what, I still don’t know. They weren’t scientists, or in the medical field. They definitely weren’t at the auction, I would have seen them. I’m pretty sure these were just ordinary guys seeing us as nothing but trophies to parade around. I don’t think they knew the significance of the serum, or the danger of it. They saw something shiny and thought to hell with it. Which, I guess looking back, was why we were always two steps ahead despite having 9mm Glock’s shoved in our faces. The hotel room we were being held in was a step up from the cage I had been trapped inside in the lab for the last several months.\n\nIt actually had air-con.\n\nSitting blindfolded on the edge of a queen sized bed wearing the same clothes which were practically glued to my flesh, the graze of cool air brushing the back of my neck and relieving blistering skin was euphoric. I hadn’t had a proper shower in weeks. Maybe months. It was the first time in a long while I actually felt human. \n\nEven when my wrists were pinned behind my back, a slab of ductape suffocating my mouth and nose. Now, I wasn’t completely sure, but I wondered if there was a duct tape shortage on the island. After being kidnapped and held in multiple places, I had never been gagged with duct tape. \n\nIt was always filthy clothing fashioned into a makeshift gag, or ties and shoelaces. \n\nI will  never forget some asshole stuffing a pair of panties in my mouth. Seth’s gang were the first to actually have duct tape and proper blindfolds. I sensed the front-man’s footsteps as he paced in front of us. Despite being blindfolded, I knew he had a gun tucked into his belt, a dagger strapped to his ankle, and a grenade for emergencies. I wasn’t sure what emergencies would justify blowing up a fancy hotel room. Next to me, Riss was practically vibrating with fury. She knew not to act on her fear, because when we did, bad shit happened.\n\nBut Riss was a different breed. She didn’t listen to me when we were human, and definitely didn’t listen to me when we were freakish experiments contorted into something resembling a human. No matter how many times I nudged her with reassurance, she inched away from me like I had the plague. “Project Mildew, huh?” The front-man had one hell of an aussie accent. Without my sight, the rest of my senses were expanding, igniting. \n\nSmell. I could smell the stink of myself, body odour and filth caked into my skin. Taste. There was copper in my throat and coating my teeth and tongue. Every step the man made, I felt it prickling in my bones. I sensed him crouching in front of Kaian, who thankfully didn’t move. I was waiting for him to. If I concentrated, I could feel the air crackling with electricity, the hairs on the back of my neck and arms standing up. Just being shoulder to shoulder with my colleague  allowed me to feel exactly what he was feeling. \n\nAnd like Riss, the guy was dangerously close to blowing a fuse. Kaian wasn’t stupid though. If we did something, he knew the consequences of that something. And none of us wanted that.  So, staying quiet and submissive it was. \n\n“Alex Quincy’s diamonds!” The front-man  flicked me in the forehead, and I had to squeeze my eyes shut to avoid going into sensory overload. He continued in a sing-song voice, his steps becoming playful, like he was dancing. Every so often I sensed his fingers wrapping around his 9mm. Maybe he wasn’t as stupid as I initially thought. “Project Mildew.” He repeated. “You looked better on camera.”\n\nRiss scoffed under her gag. I don’t think this asshole understood that on camera we were still human. It’s not like I was planning on going to a fashion show, but the shorts and t-shirt combo I had been wearing for weeks were comfortable.\n\nAnother step. Holding my breath, I gripped the ropes entangling my wrists and prayed they were physical enough to be an anchor.\n\n“The testers who became the tested!” He continued. “Ohhh, man. I’ve heard about you. You’re famous here. Professor Quincy’s human lab rats! And successful ones too! You’ve got a lot of eyes on ya, ain’t cha? Too bad we gotcha first. Yeah, that’s right. We got here first.” The guy laughed, and I felt both Riss and Kaian start to tremble. Fuck. Not now. I had to keep them at bay, even when my methods weren’t exactly stellar. I had to keep them from plunging. The rope around my wrists wasn’t too tight, and I knew I’d be able to get out of it easily. But that would require strength and energy which was for sure a trigger. There were a lot of triggers. Anger and pain. Sometimes even happiness.\n\nIt turned out basic human emotions was what this thing thrived off, so to avoid us going nuclear I had to stay stoic. No matter how much I wanted to tear off this asshole’s face, I had to keep myself together. It only took one slip up before things got really fucking brutal, really fucking fast. I wasn’t surprised my colleagues were losing control. Seth was quite the character, almost like a cartoon villain.\n\n“Damn. I’ve been looking for guard dogs, but I think we’ve found something better, aye.” His palmy fingers wandered where they shouldn’t have, grazing over my left breast and delving under my shirt, causing my body to seize up, and then relaxing slightly when he pulled off my blindfold.\n\nBlinking rapidly, I found myself eye-to-eye with the guy who had snatched us from the lab and thrown us into the back of his truck. I only got glimpses of him during our kidnapping, thanks to the ski-mask covering his face. Now I was looking at a man who was maybe in his early thirties with a balding head and a vicious cartoon smile twisted with mania. His eyes glinted when I found myself shuffling back, my gaze flashing to the Glock strapped to his side. Seth pulled off the other’s blindfolds.  \n\n“Now, I don’t want any funny business, alright? I watched that conference, and I know what you can do.” He stuck the barrel of his 9mm into my right temple, and next to me, Kaian ducked his head. “I’m watching you sweetheart.” Seth’s smile widened into a sickening grin. “If you start any weird shit, I’ll blow your brains out.”\n\nI did my best to nod, and he ripped the tape off of our mouths too.\n\n“Alright!” Seth straightened up, eyeing us like we were hunks of meat. “Nice to meet cha! I’ll be looking after you guys from now on.”\n\n“Looking after us?” I spoke up, my voice gravelly. “You mean you’ll be cutting into us and selling our brains on the black market.”\n\nSeth laughed like a fucking hyena.  “What?” He scratched the back of his head with his gun. “Nah, that’s fucked up. We just want dogs.”\n\nThe man’s smile dampened, however, when his gaze settled on Kaian.  Gesturing to my colleague with his gun, he scowled. “What’s wrong with him?  Did Quincy rip out the guy’s tongue?” Before I could answer, Seth crouched in front of Kaian with narrowed eyes. “You all spoke at the conference,” he murmured. “Sure, your professor forced you, but you introduced yourselves and your subject numbers. Except him.”\n\nFuck.\n\nA shiver ripped its way down my spine when Seth shot out a finger and pointed at my colleague, and my mouth started to dry up, my lips cracking. Kaian was perfectly reading his lips, every word curled under his tongue, his eyes flicking back and forth to drink in each one, and each word brought more heat, brought more goosebumps pricking on my arms and legs. Kaian’s body pressed against mine was overheating.   I could feel the sensation coming over my body, like a wave of pressure. Riss made a squeaking noise, and I concentrated on Seth—who didn’t seem to notice it. I’ve come to realise, whether you are a human, an animal, or a badly fucked up experiment created in a lab, it doesn’t matter what you are capable of. If you initially appear weak and powerless, the stronger will single you out. Seth was enjoying himself so much  he didn’t realise the skin in his cheeks start to crack from all the moisture being sucked from the air. Kaian didn’t move or speak, and that seemed to thrill him even more. “Speak.” Seth snarled, leaning closer until he was inches from my colleagues face. \n\n“Speak!”\n\n“He’s deaf.” I gritted out.\n\nSeth’s eyes darkened. “Deaf, huh? He better be worth it.” Kaian didn’t flinch when the man grabbed him by the hair and yanked his head back. He was completely stoic, like a puppet severed from his strings, allowing the asshole to stick his Glock between his eyes. I noticed the air move slightly around us, blurring and then coming together. It was a blink and you’ll miss it moment, and I had spent months being taught how to notice it. “Three and a half million dollars each, hmm?” Seth said in a breath, dragging the butt of his gun down my colleagues face, grazing it across the flesh of his neck. “I don’t remember paying for a fucking mute. You can learn to talk, kid. I ain’t messing around here.”\n\nAgain, Kaian didn’t even acknowledge the man, and that infuriated him even more. “Hey!” Seth grabbed his jaw, forcing Kaian to look at him. “Are you fucking listening to me? Open your mouth. You either speak or you die. Like I said, I didn’t pay half a million each for a mute.”\n\nRiss must have noticed the significant change in the air and temperature. Between the two of us, it was our job to stop Kaian from plunging.\n\n“You didn’t spend shit on us.” She spoke up with a hiss. Riss was already panicked, and that wasn’t good. “You took us from the lab while everyone else was at the auction because you couldn’t afford us. Which makes me wonder how you afforded this fancy five star hotel room.”\n\nI had to swallow a yell. I wanted her to stall, not give the guy a reason to start going trigger-happy.\n\nSeth’s narrowed eyes found Riss’s. “Your professor and I had an agreement, sweetheart,” he said. \"How 'bout I blow your brains out, huh? Since you like speaking out of turn. And I don’t like my doggies speaking out of turn.” \n\nAs Seth moved closer to her, I sensed Riss freaking out. It was too early for her to start the plunge, but she was the most unpredictable out of the four of us. Just like when she was human, her emotions were all over the place. Still though, she maintained a scowl and refused to move when Seth was practically eye to eye with her, hot breath grazing her cheeks. The man prodded her in her right temple. “I bet you’re filled to the brim with all that fancy ass Quincy serum.\"\n\nHe dragged his filthy finger down her cheek, and she squeaked. “I’m pretty sure I can just crack you open and take it for myself.”\n\n“Then…” Riss swallowed, choking on her words. I nudged her again, this time enough to shake the bed. But she wasn’t looking at me, her eyes starting to lose vacancy. Next to me, I knew the same thing was happening to Kaian. \n\nBut I wouldn’t look at him yet. If I did, I would lose it myself. “Then you’ll be losing valuable cargo.” I was surprised when her lips broke out into an equally psychotic grin. I had no doubt the plunge was taking hold of her. She leaned back almost casually, and the air seemed to move around her, seeping into her skin and taking an unyielding hold. \"Considering the crazy lengths you took to capture all of us, I doubt you want that. You're all bark with no bite, asshole.\"\n\n“Riss.” I said through my teeth, at the exact same time as the air-con behind us blew a fuse and crashed to the ground. “Shut up.”\n\nThe plunge started slow, but even when it was barely a prickle in the air it was already beginning its slow purging of every particle.\n\nI watched a mosquito that had been in mid-flight towards the fancy looking lamp on the nightstand bleed into invisible folds of energy which were becoming progressively more visible to the naked eye the more my friends plunged. I could see it perfectly. Like the world around us was beginning to splinter apart. Ignoring Riss, who could stand up for herself, Seth’s attention went back to Kaian, who couldn’t. Or at least that was his façade. Kaian had been labelled the most dangerous out of all of Quincy’s experiments. But it wasn’t just because of the plunge.\n\n“I’m talking to you!” Seth prodded my colleague’s chest, and a wave of heat slammed into me, stealing my breath away. I watched, knowing it was all going to be over in matter of seconds. The front-man grabbed my colleague by the collar of his shirt and yanked him violently to his feet. “You’ve got two seconds to speak,” He spat, before slamming the butt of his gun into Kaian’s head. “Speak, or I give you a frontal lobotomy.” Seth continued in seething breaths, and got closer and closer, failing to notice he was already losing. But so were we.  \n\nHis lips split into a grin. “Speak, or I start asking questions. Like why I bought four of you— and there are three of you.” He poked the metal prongs sticking from Kaian’s head. I liked to call them horns to make them sound cooler. But in reality, they were agonising when I was human—two pieces of metal drilled directly into the top of my skull. They had been a part of me for a while, but I wasn’t going to forget how they had been forcefully inserted into my skull. While I screamed. “Three. Little. Freaks.” Seth’s lips were practically kissing my colleague's temple.\n\nHe prodded the metal horns, and Kaian’s lip twitched. “Without their fourth.”\n\nThat struck a chord in both of them—and I knew if I didn’t do something, like right then, a fate worse than death awaited all of us.\n\n\"Leave him alone.” I found my voice tangled in my throat. But I could barely bring myself to speak. I felt like I was being fucking suffocated by two separate energy’s around me slowly but surely ripping atoms apart. In the corner of my eye, things were starting to melt into the ground, disappearing completely. The carpet in the room was suddenly singed black, and the wave continued, slicing off the tips of my hair I had only just managed to grow back. “He can’t hear you, asshole.” I said through lingering breaths.  “Professor Quincy said he was deaf.”\n\n\"Deaf?” Seth let out a belly laugh. “He's my new guard dog and he's expected to fucking bark.” His lip curled,” Now. Speak.”\n\nA second went by.\n\nThen another.\n\nAbsent-mindedly, I licked the taste of rusty coins from the corner of my lip.\n\n“I said speak!” Seth slammed the butt of his gun into my colleagues face again, but this time his words broke apart in his throat. I sensed every individual letter shattering into pieces when his body was flung back by an invisible force. I knew that invisible force. I knew the phantom fingers wrapping around his throat and slamming the man into the wall until he was screaming, begging, his feet hovering several feet from the ground. Kaian didn’t even have to pull apart his restraints. \n\nRiss was already screaming, turning to my colleague. Her hands were free, and she was signing desperately. Don’t. Her eyes were wide, lips twisted. Because she knew exactly what would follow. Seth, somehow, managed a spluttered laugh between broken teeth like tiny yellow chicklets sticking from his mouth. “Oh, you don’t like that do you?” More brilliant red spurted like a fountain, and yet the asshole kept laughing. “Look at you! Quincy didn’t hold back on you did he?”\n\nI’m not saying my colleague enjoyed crushing Seth’s windpipe without even lifting a finger—but that is exactly what I am saying.\n\nWith a simple incline of Kaian’s head, the front-man was rupturing from the inside, choking on organs erupting into his throat.\n\nAnd like it thrilled him, the idea of death, the idea of dying at the hands of a supernatural force, Seth continued to roar with laughter.\n\nMy colleague was pressing pressure points which shouldn’t be pressed. Especially pressure points in a genetically fucked up man whose trauma had turned him into the wildcard of our group. The amount of shit we had all gone through inside Quincy’s lab was enough to send us into insanity. Except my colleague, according to Quincy, hadn’t responded correctly at the beginning. And being a researcher myself with rabbits before I became a lab rat myself, I knew the only way to get results was to cause pain.\n\nI never initiated that pain in the rabbits, but I was an enabler. I watched my professor torture these subjects to make sure they were prepped and ready for the serum. Maybe our karma was that the exact same happened to us. But to Kaian, it was on a much larger scale. I was never briefed on what exactly happened to him during the months from March to June. Though it was obvious he had had it the worst. I didn’t know why. I didn’t understand why his brain was different, or maybe he was more resilient. He had been better at fighting it. \n\nKaian hated two things. Being kidnapped and said kidnappers mentioning our fourth member. And it was those things which made him plunge. Which made him lose all sense of humanity and morality and emotion, essentially turning him into a mindless beast. That was one half of the plunge. “Do you want me to say his name?” Seth coughed up spattered scarlet, and I could already see what was happening to him. Kaian had done enough damage externally. Internally, however? \n\nThat was another story.  \n\nInternally, I sensed every organ starting to peel apart and splinter, bursting into nothing. It started with pressure on his heart which was slow and dragged so he felt everything. Then the brain began to expand. When blood ran in sharp rivulets from every orifice, and Seth screamed, howling like an animal, I looked away, just in time for the rest of the man’s body to pop like a balloon, and a chunk of his skull to land right in front of me. Riss started screaming, and I was half aware of a slight taint of warm blood like paint splattering the side of my face.\n\nWhen I twisted back to look at him, his body was still hovering without a head, a skeletal hand lifting and waving at us.\n\nRiss dropped to her knees, her head in her hands, trembling, and I followed her, trying to get some semblance of control.\n\n“It’s been a week.” Riss whispered, sobbing, swiping at her eyes with bloody hands, making them worse. “Oh god, what if… what if I was right? What if we’re too late? I knew this was… this was a bad idea. But nobody listens to Riss. I knew he wouldn’t come. Fuck. I knew it.”\n\n“Calm down.” I said. “Concentrate on happy birthday, okay? Do you want me to sing it with you?”\n\nRiss spluttered. “We’re going to dieeee,” she sang. “Can you feel it? I’m plunging, Wren. God, it feels so fucking good.”\n\nShe knocked her head into the wall with crazy eyes.  \n\nIt took exactly half a second for our brains to decide whether we were going to fight it or give in to it.\n\n“Hey. Riss.” I spoke in reassuring hisses, grasping her shoulders and forcing her to look at me. “Happy birthday.” I choked out. “Three times. It has to be three times.” When she didn’t respond, I shook her until her cloudy found mine. Riss was plunging. Like Kaian. The blood vessels in her eyes had popped, her lips cracking apart. \n\nIf I concentrated, I could see her bare knees starting to melt into air, wisps of her hair starting to disintegrate.   “Do it, now!” I shrieked when Kaian finally let go of the man’s body, and it hit the ground in front of us like a bad joke. “Happy birthday.” I said the mantra over and over again, shaking my colleague until she was responding. “Three times, Riss. Right now.” When she shook her head, screeching, I grabbed her hands and entangled her fingers with mine. “I’ll start, okay? And you follow me.”\n\nTo my surprise, Riss nodded—and for the fraction of a second, my colleague, or what was left of her, stopped bleeding into visible particles which were now around us, like a glistening wave of ocean water enveloping us. “Happy birthday to you…” I whispered, squeezing her hands tighter, relieved when she repeated the verse. When I was sure Riss was anchoring herself, I turned to Kaian who was sitting cross legged in front of the mutilated body. \n\nMy gaze went to the door. It would only be matter of time before Seth’s goons figured out something was wrong, and the last thing I wanted was them to walk in mid-plunge. “Happy birthday to…” I continued, allowing Riss to fill in a name—before focusing on my other colleague. I’m not exaggerating when I say Kaian was covered head to toe in blood, like it was his canvas, like he belonged in it. It was too late for him. I could already see that in his vacant and foggy eyes and playful smile that he had accepted the plunge.\n\nWillingly.\n\n“Gross.” Kaian signed, pulling a face. He turned his nose up at mutilated flesh and bone, and I had a hard time looking him in the eye.\n\nI exhaled out a breath.\n\n“Kaian.” I spoke and signed calmly, but my skin was prickling and scalding. I could feel the flesh on the backs of my hands peeling off. “Happy birthday.” I made sure to emphasize every word clearly, even when I knew he could read every word from my mouth without even trying.\n\nHe started to shake his head, and I glimpsed that panic, the trauma of the last several months starting to bloom behind his eyes.\n\n“No, you have to do it.” I hissed out. “Look around you.” I signed. “If you don’t do it, we’re going to plunge.”\n\nI was practically slamming my hands together with frustration, but he shook his head, his gaze going elsewhere.\n\n“What if I…” He paused signing, his lip curling, “Like it?”\n\nDo you know when you know something is wrong but you keep shoving it to the back of your head until you can’t ignore it anymore?\n\nYeah, this was one of those moments.\n\nI loved Kaian. I loved him like a brother. But there was something about his face, the way he delved his fingers into startling red pooling on the carpet, that made me want to get as far away from him as possible. Swallowing hard, I shook away the thought and grabbed hold of his hand. \n\nOnce I did, the air around us wavered, and flesh on his cheeks started to flake. “Happy birthday…” Riss, who was sitting with what was left of her knees pressed to her chest, choked out a sob, “This isn’t working… Wren. This isn’t fucking working. I can’t.. I can’t fucking do this.” When she beat the floor with crumbling fists, the whole room jolted. The ground beneath us shook, and Kaian shot me a panicked look. Even plunging, he was still scared. \n\nAnd I didn’t blame him. \n\nAfter telling Riss to continue, I managed a smile and signed, “Earthquake.”\n\nMy colleague’s lips split into an unusual grin, and he mouthed the words, “Yeah right.”\n\nWith steely eyes, Kaian’s smile faded and for once he actually looked serious. “Jem.” He signed. “I don’t think he’s coming for us.”\n\nIgnoring a conversation I really didn’t want to have, I focused on the body. “Check his pockets,” I signed back. “We don’t have much time.”\n\nI pulled out a passport, some Indonesian currency, and an old plane ticket.\n\nChecking his phone didn’t help. I was just reminded the boarders were still shut, and this asshole had a whole group chat gloating about his so-called guard dogs.\n\n“Wren!”\n\nWhen I lifted my head, Riss’s wild eyes were flickering around the room, drinking in parts of reality being sucked away.\n\nHer mouth became lopsided, lips drooping like my colleague was having a stroke from the pressure building around her.\n\nSee, I describe this in  a lot of detail like this lasted around five to minutes long. But no, all of this happened in the space of around two minutes. When footsteps sounded outside, and Kaian’s head snapped to the door, his eyes darkening, a sour paste crept up my throat.\n\nProfessor Quincy didn’t just take away our humanity. He twisted us into something resembling an animal inside a human body. We spoke and acted and felt like humans. But once a stranger was nearby, or footsteps on territory we had unknowingly snatched as our own, we turned feral.  I already knew Kaian was a whole new level of unpredictable and unhinged after what the experiments had done to his brain—but seeing what he was capable of even before the plunge, I froze. \n\nThe world was coming apart around me and I was plunging, but I couldn’t move. I watched him get to his feet, his fingers curling into fists at his sides. The footsteps were closing in on us getting louder and louder, and Kaian could sense every vibration. I could tell with the way his lips twitched, a whole new darkness clouding his eyes and stripping away what was left of his humanity. I had seconds. There was no use in happy birthday. I remember jumping to my feet and diving on my colleagues back, bringing him to the floor like a lion would a deer. When the two of us hit the ground, I watched Riss rupture in front of me, her face glitching, becoming moving static, before her body followed. “Seth?” The voice caused Kaian to attempt to wrench out of my grasp, but I had a firm hold of him. The first three weeks of being inhuman, I was taught how to kill people. \n\nKill my fellow subjects.  \n\nApologising  profusely into  hair which smelled of blood and dirt and Quincy’s lab, I struggled to keep myself from plunging, knowing the room was already half gone, and I was going to get caught in it anyway. “I’m sorry. Fuck. I’ll make it up to you, okay? You should have sang happy fucking birthday, but you are so goddamn stubborn,” I sobbed with what I hoped was reassurance. I knew he and Riss and Jem would do exactly the same to me. \n\n“So fucking stubborn.” I couldn’t help myself, nestling my face into his hair and heaving in breaths while my skin started to peel away.\n\n“Just take a deep breath and close your eyes, okay?” I whispered into his flushed skin. “We’ll find him, Kaian. I promise you.”\n\nHe stopped struggling, and for a moment I thought my colleague was actually listening to me before the ceiling began to crack apart.\n\nThe ground rumbled again, and I lost my grip on the guy before forcing him onto his back and straddling his legs. Just when his free arm was flying out with intention to send me crashing into the back wall and ending all reality in that room, encompassing us, I snapped Kaian’s neck.\n\nAnd with the last of my energy, I fucking screamed while my own flesh melted from my face while the plunge enveloped us both.\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\nMarch 2020.\n\nIt was on the 17th day of captivity inside a cell made of glass panes meant to keep in rabbits, when I met an unlikely visitor. There comes a time when giving up is better than screaming until you have lost all of the breath in your lungs, and your throat feels like sandpaper. I hadn’t eaten in days, and what was left of my meals, curry and mash potatoes, painted my cell walls—a real work of art if I concentrated and imagined carving shapes inside congealing potato and day-old curry. \n\nSo far, I had tests. I had tests which were an invasion of privacy which I will not expand upon. I had tests where my professor’s gloved fingers ran over my scalp and marked places where he was going to insert the same headset on the rabbits. He didn’t listen to my cries. \n\nHe didn’t tell me where my colleagues were. I was nothing to him. I was a subject stripped of my rights. So, I was doing the little I could to protest. Even if it was small, I was refusing to eat. I knew subjects had to eat to stay healthy—to get results. The piece of shit wasn’t going to get much further if I died of starvation after days of no eating. How sad. I was on my second day of refusing to eat, and my gut felt like it was folding in on itself. To combat this, I sat against clinical white walls with my knees pressed to my chest, and my head buried in my lap. I ignored the rumbling of my stomach and my aching joints, the weird squiggly lines in my vision when I bothered lifting my head. It’s weird. In that cage, I was the coldest I’ve ever felt on an Indonesian island. I didn’t remember the temperature affecting the outcome of the rabbit subjects, but maybe it was different for humans. Still though, I had my solace.\n\nI imagined standing in glittering water, bioluminescent plankton washing over my bare toes. I imagined the full moon bathing the sky in warm light, and it was enough to make me feel safe— even so far from home. Far from normality. If I squeezed my eyes shut, and envisioned wading deeper into the shallows, until the water was lapping my thighs, I could calm myself and tell myself to breath. Then the water was at my waist, the panic subsiding. Neck deep, ice cold water is filling my mouth and suffocating the nose. But if I thought past it, if I plunged myself into the deep, I could trick my brain into imagining that I was  escaping, swimming across the wide expanse of ocean. All the way back home. \n\nI was brought out of my imagination when a scratching noise pulled me back to my senses, and I was back inside my cage.\n\nLifting my head, I searched for someone. But there was nobody there.\n\n“Over here, genius.”\n\nThe voice startled me. It wasn’t quite a voice, more of an attempt. Though I could definitely make out the language bursting out. When my eyes swivelled, I found myself staring at a blur of white. I squinted. \n\nNo, not just a blur of white. It was Subject Fifteen. The rabbit which had stolen Jem’s heart, and possibly taken control of his mind. For a moment I tried to blink myself awake, but no matter how many times I pinched myself, the rabbit was still there, pressing its tiny face against glass, and I can see blood staining it's fur. Initially, I thought he was a hallucination until I blinked, and he was still very much there.\n\nHe was part of reality, lightly smushing its bloody mouth against glass panes. The sight of dark red tainting its fur twisted my gut, and I had a thought which suddenly wouldn’t leave me alone. If the serum did that to the rabbits, what exactly would it do to us? “Well.” Fifteen’s beady eyes found mine, and I swore its rabbit mouth twisted into a grin. It's voice mimicked both me and my colleagues, the perfect imitation of us. I could hear all of us, even the professor, in every curl of its words. \n\nIt wasn’t just intelligent, it was something else—something fucking monstrous. Which should have been put down. \n\nNo. It never should have been a subject at all. \n\nI slowly crawled towards it and held my breath. I must have looked pretty fucking funny to Fifteen. I was the tester who had become the tested. The one who wore the lab-coat, to the rat forced into light blue scrub like clothes sticking to me. I can’t say I wasn’t curious, though.  Baffled.\n\nI was inches from a fucking talking rabbit, and the last time I checked rabbits weren't supposed to talk. Their mouths haven't evolved to form words. But somehow it was figuring out speech. Fifteen was learning fast. That fucking terrified me.\n\nAfter several attempts at speech, it had almost fully mimicked a human’s expression. It cocked its head, and in Jem’s voice, asked, “Well? How does it feel to be the one in the cage?\"\n\n“You’re not real.” I told the rabbit which sounded like Jem.\n\nTo my shock, it laughed, and its bloody mouth almost formed a snarl. “Are you sure about that?”\n\nI crawled over to the screen, pressing my hands against glass. “How does…” I licked my lips. “How does what feel?”\n\nThe rabbit’s eyes followed me and I shuffled back, a sour paste creeping its way up my throat. “You were always my least favorite,” it murmured.  It’s nose twitched. “I think you humans call it karma—- and whether you believe in it or not, every action must have an equal reaction.” It moved closer, pressing its face against the glass. I noticed the fur around it’s mouth was stained red. “You drilled into my head, Wren. You hurt me day after day and hid behind a sense of morality that you were a good person because it was for the good of the human race.” Fifteen edged closer. “I wish I could feel sorry for you. I wish I could feel the sympathy you humans use as a pathetic fucking barrier. \n\nBut aren’t you just… the cutest?”  \n\nThe thing was mimicking my own words from the start of the experiments. I had pressed my face against the plastic cage, peering at Subject Fifteen, who was hiding in the corner. Quincy told me to turn off my humanity, but that didn’t stop me as seeing them as cute little fury bunnies. It never crossed my mind that Fifteen could hear exactly what we had been saying.\n\nI thought back to a few months back when I had picked it up from its cage and nuzzled its fur. “Aww! Isn’t he just the cutest?”\n\nFifteen knew the exact moment I gave up, my hands slipping from the glass. It gestured to the band aid uncomfortably sticking to my scalp.\n\n“Nice horns.”\n\n“You have intelligence.” I whispered through a sob. I leaned closer. “Quincy. You need to tell me what he’s doing to the others.”\n\n“You already know what he’s planning to do, Wren.” The rabbit chuckled, lifting a paw in a mocking wave. “Why are you asking me, hmm? What if I am in fact an illusion? You’re not eating. Your mind has been played with. Are you sure you are really speaking to a talking rabbit?”\n\nIt cocked its head. “How do you know I’m not Jem?”\n\n“Or Riss.” It’s voice twisted into hers, and then the professor’s.\n\n“I’m losing my mind.” I whispered, pinching the flesh on my bare thighs. “I’m losing my fucking mind.”\n\n“Maybe.” It said, “or you’re witnessing the consequences of your actions. You did this to me if you remember. I told you to stop hurting me, but you didn’t hear me, Wren. You never heard me. Only him. And when I was strong enough, I made him force you to  finally listen to me.”\n\nJem, I thought hysterically.\n\n“You little—“ I slammed my hands into the glass, unable to resist a snarl when it turned to hop away. “Hey! Wait! What did you do to Jem?”\n\n“I didn’t do anything,” the rabbit responded in a scoff. “Your professor, however… have you ever heard of teleportation?”\n\nI stared at it blinking rapidly, until it laughed. “No, not that kind! I mean the new kind. I’m talking about what Quincy is trying to perfect.”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“Think about it.” The rabbit’s nose twitched, “What you have been working on and researching—what if it was possible in humans?”\n\nI shook my head. There was no way. If professor Quincy wanted to test on us, it would likely be psychokinesis which was possible in rabbits.\n\n“That’s impossible.” I managed to grit out. “With rabbits it’s one thing, and it’s barely even stable! With humans… it’s...”\n\nIt’s barbaric.\n\nThe rabbits which went through that procedure and survived… their brains were drastically altered. They were never the same.\n\nThat’s what I wanted to say.\n\nI trailed off at the thought of forcing a living and breathing human to shatter apart into atoms and forcefully moved  from one place to another. I remembered Subject 12. The tiny little thing coming apart slowly, piece by piece, a mixture of fur, blood and bones filling its cage.\n\nNo way.\n\nThere was no way my psycho professor would attempt it in humans.  \n\nThe rabbit hopped away. “Huh. Well, you’re dumber than I thought. I guess I’ll be going if you’re just going to look at me like that.”\n\nWhen I thought it was going to leave me, the furry little shit twisted its head. “Do you want to know a secret?”\n\nIt hopped right over to the glass. “Come closer, and I’ll tell you. I want you to get really close so I can see how adorable you are.”\n\nToo desperate to feel humiliated, I swallowed a shriek and pressed my ear to the glass.\n\n“Jem was the first.” The rabbit started to say but was cut off by the speaker above me crackling, a familiar voice slicing into my ears.\n\n“Good morning. I will be with you shortly. I would like you to raise your hands above your head. I will be administering a gas.”\n\nAt the corner of my eye, Fifteen was disappearing behind the corner, and I let out a frustrated hiss. “Professor Quincy.” I managed to force my voice into professional, despite the rabbits voice in my mind. Jem was the first to what? I hadn’t seen either of my colleagues in weeks— or heard from them. I swallowed hard. “Professor Quincy, Subject Fifteen is on the premises and is showing signs of heightened intelligence!”\n\nThe rabbit tskked. “And to think I was going to help you. Good luck with the experiments. I will have a front row seat.”\n\nBefore it left me in puddling static however, the rabbit didn’t hesitate to drop a bombshell which sent me crumpling to my knees.\n\n“Oh, yeah! I forgot to say.” Subject Fifteen’s words slammed into me as I was choked once again with gas filling my mouth and nose.\n\n“Jem was the first to die.” It said in a sing-song symphony of all of our voices, “And you don’t even know the best part!”",

I suppose one benefit to being responsible for a motel beset by supernatural obligations is the ability to sleep late in the mornings.  It felt good to be at least partially rested.  I took a shower, washed my hair and I was even able to resist the urge to spike my coffee. \n\nJust as I gathered enough courage to take another crack at the notebook, a piece of paper slid through my door.  Immediately knew the author.  *Martina doesn’t text.*\n\nThe note was characteristically brief: *Cottage 13. Meet me in the basement.*\n\nThirteen.  Of course cottage number *thirteen* was associated with some terrifying supernatural force that required its payment. With a sigh I flipped open the notebook.\n\n*Number 13*\n\n*Deer carcass (okay if not completely defrosted).*  *Pack of cigarettes (any brand).*  *Six pack of Labatt Blue.*\n\n*Leave before sunset.*\n\n*Payment schedule:*  *every full moon*\n\nI spit out my coffee. \n\n\\++\n\nThere is a small basement under the motel office that mostly consists of boxes and a couple giant, commercial-size freezer chests. When I arrived, Martina was already halfway inside one of them, muttering to herself, shifting various small packages out of the way.\n\n“So what is it today, a frat boy sasquatch?”\n\nShe groaned and removed herself from the freezer with a wheezing cough. \n\n“Glad to see you’re doing your reading.” \n\n“Is this some sort of joke?  Labatt’s?  Cigarettes?”\n\n“Oh, it absolutely is.  Just not any joke of mine.”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“Can you check and see if there’s a deer at the bottom of this?” \n\nI nodded.  Somehow, despite no longer having normal guests, the freezer was filled to the brim with packages of breakfast sausage, chicken breasts, and ice pops. It was so deep, I had to lower my entire upper body down to reach the bottom.  Sure enough, there was a large mass wrapped in wax paper.\n\n“Okay, I’m pretty sure it’s down here. It’s uh…pretty big.”\n\n“That’s the last one we have.  I need to follow up with the hunter’s club for our allotment for the year.”\n\n“Let me do that.  Taking over the reins, remember?”\n\nMartina shrugged, but I could see a faint smile crease her face.\n\n“Fine.  The number is in the address book in the top desk drawer upstairs.”\n\n“Consider it done!  Easy.  Now I don’t suppose we have a year’s supply of Labatt’s down here, do we?  If not, I think there’s a pretty old six pack in my cottage’s fridge. Probably pretty flat, but do you think this thing will mind?” \n\nHer face fell.  Under the sleeves of her oversized sweatshirt, her fists were clenched, knuckles white.\n\n“This…thing,” She began slowly, the anger deepening in her voice. “This *beast* enjoys mocking me.”\n\n“You?  Why?  What could it possibly have against you?”\n\nShe stared at the freezer, face inscrutable, as if contemplating her next words or perhaps finding herself lost in the past. \n\n“Help me with this damn deer.”\n\nI haven’t spent my life around hunters or venison or any aspect of large scale meat storage.  So while I had some idea that this wouldn’t be easy, I really had no idea how heavy this thing was going to be.  Really heavy.  We had a dolly and some rope, but it still took the two of us over an hour to haul it out of the basement and over to Cottage 13 for it to thaw. Both of us were sweating and out of breath.  Martina took out a new package of the cheapest cigarettes she could find and threw it at the deer.\n\n“Should we uhh…unwrap the meat and the cigarettes?”\n\n“No!”  She spat on the kitchen steps and scowled a look so angry, I thought the cottage door would burst into flame.  “Asshole can figure it out on his own.”\n\n“We still have a few hours before sundown.  I’ll bring over the beer, and then what?”\n\n“You go home, lock your doors, and put these on.”  She tossed me a pair of thick bangle bracelets of solid silver.\n\n“Okay, sounds simple enough.”\n\n“You would think so,” she muttered.  “You would certainly think so.” She squinted down at the payment for Cottage 13, deep in thought.  After a moment, she raised her head, a pained expression on her worn face. “Come on, Nora. It’s time I told you about Jake.”\n\n\\++\n\nI had placed the last piece of Cottage 13’s payment at the doorstep and Martina and I were now settled in my cottage, both of us with a nice glass of Chateauneuf du Pape, my addition to my late uncle’s alcohol supply, which, while copious, mostly consisted of scotch and bourbon.  I have no problem with either spirit, however, I also prefer to have a greater variety of libations.\n\n“You know I’m a creature of habit, Nora, but I must admit this French stuff is nice.  Usually, I just stick to the tobacco.”\n\n“See, this broadening of horizons goes both ways!”\n\nI was eager to prod her, to bring out the notebook again and go page by page, beg for every story she could share. *Let the poor lady enjoy her glass of wine*.  \n\nBut Martina also seemed anxious to speak.\n\n“This is hard for me, of course.  I’m not really a team player.  When I first came up here, your grandfather told me that to do this job is to be alone.  That was fine by me.  I was your age, just got out of a bad marriage, didn’t think I needed anyone.  The only person I had in my life was my mother, and, for better or worse, I got this stubbornness from her.  So I did the job.  I did it well.  It didn’t matter that I was scared shitless half the time; we didn’t have any trouble.  People were safe because of me and I was proud of that.  When your grandfather died, your uncle left the management almost entirely to me.  I was proud of that too.  You know your Uncle Jimmy, he was a gentle soul. I respect him for understanding that he just couldn’t handle it. \n\nBy the summer of 1999, I had been doing the job for nearly thirty years. When I heard that my mother’s health was failing, I thought to myself that I could take some time. I deserved it. Your uncle was enthusiastically in favor of this. But I knew I couldn’t leave the management to just anyone, not even for a few days. Luckily, at that time we were far from the next tax day. But I needed the right person. After all, how many people do you think could ‘confirm receipt’ of The Wet Lady’s payment?”\n\nMy stomach churned at the memory.  I shook my head.\n\n“Your uncle had a friend whose son had a few weeks before he went back to school. Smart kid, a rising junior at Clarkson. Engineering. Had his head screwed on straight. His name was Jake Hubert. I decided to meet him and found myself impressed. He was tall, lanky, a bit goofy looking, but took direction well and seemed eager to learn. As you know, of course, these qualities are more requirements for normal employment rather than the true task at hand. But there Jake impressed me too. Jimmy had had a talk with him, about his views on …” She waived her hand impatiently.  “You know, weird shit. Jake told him he grew up in a haunted house himself, that he took such things seriously. I was pleasantly surprised. I thought…” \n\nMartina’s eyes clouded, her voice cracked with tears. “I’m not a religious person, but I say my prayers every night.  I thought perhaps this kid was a sign from God that it was okay to let go, just for a little bit.”\n\nI reached over and tried to take her hand, but she swatted me away.\n\n“Anyway, I trained him the entire week before I left. He was very attentive and trustworthy, though I did catch him sneaking a few of my cigarettes. As I said, I had everything sorted, organized, ready to go. The day I left I stopped by the office one last time to hand him the keys. Jake was there, waiting, but with him was his girlfriend and a six pack of Labatt’s. Now I don’t care what anyone does in their private lives, but it was completely inappropriate even for a normal job, and even worse given the type of obligations we have here. I pulled him aside and tried to express my disapproval, but he claimed I was being too harsh, that of course she would be leaving any second, that she only came with him because she was waiting for her brother to pick her up. I didn’t believe him. You see, he never looked me in the eyes, which was odd for him. But I told myself, I had to trust someone for once in my life.  And my mother was becoming sicker by the day. My mother gave birth to me on her own in Nazi-occupied Greece after her husband was shot for being in the Resistance.  I sure as hell wasn’t going to let her die alone because of a horny college student.\n\nI made a mistake.  I see that now. Because in addition to giving your mother the key to the wrong cottage, Jake made another mistake.  A fatal one. I knew it would be a full moon while I was gone, but I didn’t think that would be an issue. Up until then, the payments for Cottage 13 were the easiest of any. Just the deer. He just needed to put the deer at the front of the cottage and go home. That was it. That was all I usually did. Your uncle always made sure the motel was empty on full moons. \n\nI later learned that Jake decided to take advantage of the empty motel and invite his girlfriend over. What happened next, I’m not entirely sure. The girlfriend told police that they had heard noises outside, so he decided to go out and investigate with the gun from the safe. She said it sounded like a big animal. She heard shots ring out, Jake screaming in terror, and then a horrible grunting noise. She was too afraid to leave the motel, a decision that saved her life. In the morning, the only thing she could find was the gun, some spent shell casings and a copious amount of blood and…flesh. Poor kid. The girlfriend gave her report to the police, but then immediately fled back to her parents’ house somewhere downstate. I received the call after returning to the hotel from my mother’s funeral.”\n\nShe took a deep breath and rubbed her temples wearily. \n\n“They barely had anything to bury,” she said, her voice labored. “The next full moon, I was angry. I stayed over at the motel and listened to that miserable thing growl and moan and grunt all fucking night. In the morning, I actually found a note, written in blood on the steps of Cottage 13. The handwriting was all over the place, but I was able to make out ‘*Next Time. Add pack of smokes. Six pack Labatts.’* I ripped it up immediately, but I knew we had to obey. That bastard was mocking me, mocking that kid it had ripped apart under my watch. Somehow it *knew*, it knew the kid had liked my smokes and that shitty beer.”\n\n“What an asshole,” I added. “Do you know what it even is?” \n\nShe shook her head. \n\n“No one who has seen it has lived to tell the tale. It is certainly noisy though, as you’ll figure out tonight. And it does not like silver.” \n\n“Speaking of,” I shook my wrists making the bangles jingle. “I’m all set. I want you to go home and rest. I’m going to lock the door behind you and then complain about hearing this thing all night when I see you tomorrow morning. Got it?”\n\nShe nodded, but was clearly still reluctant. She did allow me to escort her to her car and see her off, just as the sky was beginning to deepen into the oranges of sunset. True to my word, I locked my door behind me. I figured I’d just put my white noise machine on and go to bed early.\n\nAs you might have surmised, given how things have been going around here, my night was not nearly that boring.\n\nAbout an hour after sunset, I began to hear it. At first it was just heavy footfalls, accompanied by the occasional animal pant. Though I had been mentally preparing myself all day for the creature’s arrival, I was still filled with dread. *At least I’m not outside*. I double checked the locks on the front door. I retreated to the bedroom, at the back of the cottage. I had my laptop, a few podcasts and a decent internet connection to distract myself.\n\nBut then the howling began. Now I’m hardly a wildlife expert, but there’s no way this was a dog, or a wolf, or a coyote. The howling was deeper, more guttural, as though the sound was coming from the land itself. It wove its way through the property, accompanied by a wet growl, and then the scraping, crunching, tearing sound of the deer being consumed in front of Cottage 13. I sighed. *Receipt of payment, I guess*. This occupied the creature for some time, and I began to close my eyes and drift off to sleep. \n\nHowever, just before I was able to do so, I was jolted awake. Something was compelling me to get out of bed. Outside, the sounds had ceased, giving way to a silence that was not all together peaceful. I rose and left my bedroom almost unconsciously, as though I were being pulled by an invisible lure. I tried to shake it off, but the more I fought, the more the pressure increased in my head, beckoning me forward. *No, no, I’m not that stupid.*  I shook my head and raised my hands to my temples, the silver bangles brushing against me. I pressed them against my skin and fell to the floor as if suddenly released. \n\nAt that moment, a heaving roar erupted from the front of my cottage, wretched in its fury, followed by the force of a huge object crashing into my front porch and thudding against the door with a sickening crack. I clutched the silver even tighter, curled into a fetal position on the wood floor. The door held, but just barely. A humid, rancid stench filled the air of my cottage, like the breath of a rotting dog. Just beyond the wall beside me, I could sense the panting Beast, I could feel it’s anger. A primordial instinct of self-preservation overtook my human urge to shout and scream. Outside, it growled and scratched in frustration.\n\nI don’t know how long I spent in that position, every hair on my body tensed as though the Beast would break through the door any minute. I thought of Jake Hubert. *They barely had anything to bury*. I couldn’t let that happen to Martina again.  \n\nSomehow, the hours passed and the sounds diminished until the air was clear and I could hear the crickets again. I fell into a fitful, frightened sleep, but when I opened my eyes, the welcome sun drifted into my cottage and I said a prayer of thanksgiving, kissing the silver still at my wrists. I picked myself up, limbs aching and sore from sleeping in such a cramped position.\n\nWith a sigh, I inspected the front door. Luckily, it seemed to not be that damaged. The real carnage, however, appeared when I opened it. The half-eaten deer carcass had been propelled with immense strength at the cottage, completely destroying my beloved screened porch in the process. The deer lay before me with clouded, questioning eyes, already covered in flies, pieces of wood and metal mesh protruding. The threat to my life now seemingly over, the enormity of the cost of clean up and repair made me ill.\n\nI took out my phone and dialed Martina. I was happy to hear that she was groggy when she picked up—at least one of us had had a good night sleep.\n\n“First of all, I’m completely fine.”\n\n“Good. I’m sensing a ‘*but’…*”\n\nI sighed, surveying the damage.  From my standpoint I could glimpse the area in front of Cottage 13.  The cigarettes were gone, but the cans of beer were untouched. The only destruction lay at my front doorstep.  I swore under my breath.\n\n“*But* …I’m going to need the number of a good carpenter.” \n\n“That miserable son of a bitch.”",

        "text": " \n\n“Could you send in the closet man?” I asked my secretary, she sighed and heard her yell for him. I could hear the distinct thumps on the ground before hearing the familiar tone “he’s on his way” from my secretary. There was a knock on the door, I adjusted my desk and walked up to the door to open it up. There, standing in casual clothing was an 8 foot tall man, his face had a large split down the middle exposing rows of sharp teeth. His eyes were glossy white and legs were nothing but long stumps which struggled to keep his body balanced. He bared his teeth somewhat, smiling as I gestured to the couch where he slowly sat down. “How are we doing today vic?” I asked, he covered his face with his fingers “relatively bad so to say.” He hissed, he reached his hand down to pet my cat who was cuddling against his leg. I smiled as I sat down and asked my first question, “so what brings you here?”\n\n“Every night I go to a different house, hiding in the closets of unsuspecting kids, cowering beneath their blankets in an attempt to introduce them to the meaning of fear. But as of lately I’ve been finding my job has already been completed. So I tried teenagers, they were even worse, they had boxes and socks filled with their-” He cut himself off, I tried to motion for him to continue but he looked up at me with genuine concern in his glossy eyes. “Trust me, you don’t want to know what I’ve seen when it comes to them, it's barbaric, it's sickening even for me. I mean I don’t have a stomach but it makes me want to throw up.” He gagged at the thought, I took down notes, “so it must be pretty bad out there lately huh?” I asked after a moment of silence. He looked up at me, “I told you about the oath all of us monsters took when we hide under the beds or closets of kids right?” he asked, “yeah, that you would never hurt any child no matter how much you wanted to” I answered, he nodded. \n\n“Lately during my nightly calls there was something else with me, I can’t begin to describe it. It was this feeling of pure evil, darkness, that void feeling you have when you feel you’re in danger. I hid in this child's closet and I could only describe it as just this dark cloud which passed over the house. It was the closest I’ve ever been to being afraid for myself” He shuddered, “was there a possibility it was the boogeyman? I mean next time he comes in I’ll ask if he knows about this and see if we can-\"\"it’s not him, it's not the boogeyman, it's not any monster or demon I’ve ever met. It wanted me dead, I knew it did. I have alot of angels out to get me but this wasn’t an angel either.” he had a look of pure terror on his face. He began to tear up as I looked outside of my window to see a strange man lurking in the shadows. “What the hell?” I asked out loud, so I called my secretary. “Hey Kelly, is there anybody scheduled after the closet man?” I asked, knowing the answer.”No, but there was someone in here earlier asking about someone by the name of victor.” I dropped the phone, Victor was the closet man’s real name. The name before he was given the job of being a monster under the bed. \n\n“Vic, we need to get you somewhere safe, I don’t think you’re safe here.” I said, he stood up on his stumps and awkwardly walked to the door. “Where do we go?” He asked, I shrugged and we both walked out of the office, he dissipated into smoke and moved along the shadows as I walked out of the office with him tailing close behind me. The man was standing next to a pole about one hundred feet from my car. I began to panic as I rushed into the car, Victor took form in the car again, taking up the entire back seat. I looked in the mirror and sighed with relief, when I turned to the passengers side I screamed in terror as did Victor. The man was standing next to the car asking to roll down the window, I was frozen in fear. And I tend to fucking monsters, this made no sense, everything I had seen. Werewolves, skeletons, ghosts, the literal boogeyman, and yet I trembled in fear at this man. He had a steel gray mustache, his hair was unkempt, looking like it was covered in cornstarch and he was dressed like a businessman. He gave a warm smile as he reached out for me to shake his hand. “My name is Timeo, I just wanted to touch base with you.” He smiled, Victor gave a nod before I opened the door for this strange man.\n\n“Do you know who I am?” He asked, I shook my head no. “Typical, nobody knows me anymore, they rely on your monsters, ghost stories by the campfire to tell the stories of beings beyond your comprehension.” he sighed, I gripped the steering wheel with all the strength in my body trying to comfort myself. “You see tess, you can see them even though you aren’t a child, every child forgets but you never did, that is why you see them. That is why you see me, but my time is coming.” I stopped gripping the steering wheel, victor spoke up. “What do you want from us?” He asked, Timeo looked back and smiled.”It's not about what I want from you, it's what I’m going to do to all of you.” He said happily, I felt a pit in my stomach, this man was giving off the energy of pure evil in physical form. “Lucifer” I said quietly, he laughed hysterically, almost like a mad man. “Trust me, he wishes he was me, he wishes he had the guts to do what I’m capable of doing.”“which is?”, he cleared his throat. “Killing the monsters of course, introducing a new way of making them fear, sending a message that monsters are monsters. They kill, they torture and they enjoy it.” I tried to grab Timeo but immediately he turned around and stabbed Victor in the face with an ornamental dagger.\n\n“No!” I screamed, he smiled as he opened the door, “my time has come, it's time for humanity to be put back on the food chain for all of us.” he said before walking away and dissipating into a black cloud of smoke. I removed the blade and threw it out of the window.I tried to wrap the wound but the blood seeping out was too much. He gasped in pain as he tried to help cover the wound. “Please, Tessa, don't let him win. Think of the kids, he’ll kill thousands, maybe millions.” he sputtered out before going limp in the back of my car. I cried softly as the sun began to set.\n\nThe next morning I walked into my office to find a thick envelope sitting on my desk, I opened them up and began to cry again. In the envelope were photos of slaughtered monsters. Dracula impaled on a wooden fencepost, a werewolf sliced open with a dagger sitting in his head. The boogeyman hanging from his own guts, demons ripped in half. Inside was a note written in monster blood. “The night is my domain now, there are no saviors, no monsters to hide under your bed, just fear. I am the darkness, I am the meaning of fear. And now the entire human race will experience how it feels to be back on the food chain. Good night Tessa” the note was signed by Timeo, I knew already I couldn't stop it. And now it's out there. \n\nFear.",

        "text": "One night, a girl named, well... Let's just call her Sarah. One night, Sarah's parents went out for a date. They were going to be out late, so they gave Sarah some money so she could order Pizza, or some snacks. When it was late, Sarah was starting to get tired. So she put everything up, and went to bed. Sarah had a German Shepherd. They're known to be pretty good guard dogs, so she knew she was going to be safe, kind of.\n\nWhen Sarah crawled into bed, she put her hand down below her bed to make sure that her German Shepherd was still there. Let's call the Shepherd Loki. \n\nAs expected, Loki kicked Sarah's hand as a sign of love, and affection. When Sarah closed her eyes, she heard dripping coming from one of the faucets in the Bathroom upstairs. Her bedroom was located upstairs, and was right across the Bathroom. Sarah got up and started walking to turn off the faucet.\n\nShe went back to bed, and laid back down. As she was laying back down she put her hand under the bed to check if the dog was still there. Loki kicked Sarah's hand, but this time it felt odd. \n\nFor some reason the lick of the tongue was cold, and somewhat dry. It felt a lot more bumpy than a normal dog's tongue. It was almost as if the tongue were from a human...\"No, I'm paranoid\". \n\nWhen she laid her head back down, she heard walking up the stairs, as if it were a dog walking up. Sarah's heart dropped, she jumped out of her bed onto the floor with her phone in hand. She saw a scruffy old man, who looked like he was in his mid 40's. Sarah screamed so loud it was piercing her own ear-drums. \n\n\"Humans Lick too.\" The scruffy old man said with a smirk on his face. Just then, Loki came sprinting into the room and started barking. He was going hay-wire. His ears were percked up so high. Sarah had never seen a dog so...angry...\n\nLoki went under the bed and mauled the man on his face. He then grabbed the man by his forearm with his sharp teeth, and dragged him out from under the bed. Sarah witnessing her dog have so much aggression, she was afraid. Just then her parents came into the house, Sarah's Dad heard screaming coming from her room, he instantly bolted up the steps, and when he ran into the room, seeing Loki thrash his head left and right almost trying to tear the man's arm off. \"Loki off!\" Loki then let go of the man's arm, still prepared to strike again. Sarah's Dad ran to the man and punched him in the face knocking him out instantly. \n\nSarah's Mom called the police and they arrived in about 10 minutes. It turns out the man was a registered sex offender/pedophile. The police were looking for him after he ran away from the court room on the 7/23/2020\n\nLoki passed away from old age on 9/27/2022. He was 10 years old when the incident happened. So he was 12 years old when he died. That would make him about 75 in human years. Since then, everytime Sarah's parents would go out, they let Sarah go with them. \n\nGod only knows what would've happened if Loki weren't there that night...\n\n\n\"Humans Lick too....\"",

        "text": " \n\nBack when I was a stupid teenager my friends and I would go into the woods behind this old guy’s house and do some stupid shit. Sometimes we would play games or tell scary stories until we got too tired or until the old guy chased us off with his shotgun. \n\nOne night me and my friends Nate, James, Henry, and Steve were out in the woods behind the old guy’s house again and decided we would play hide and seek so James counted and Nate and I decided to stick together and we went a little further into the woods this time (the old guy was rich for making some sort of big company) when we came across this old shed that was still in pretty good condition. (you could tell because of the condition the outside of it was in) Naturally Nate and I thought that we could hide in there so we opened the door only to see a man not the old man and you can’t even really call it a man I mean yeah it stood on 2 legs and had 2 arms but it’s legs were absurdly long and the arms were so long they almost dragged as it walked toward us. Nate and I took a step back when we saw this thing’s face. It had at least a dozen eyes and razor sharp teeth stained with blood.  \n\nThe thing looked at us and let out an ear piercing roar. That’s when we ran. We didn’t run anywhere in particular, just somewhere that the creature wasn’t. Eventually we saw the old man’s house and we turned around to see if we could avoid it only to see nothing until we looked up and saw the creature up in the trees staring at us. Then it jumped down and began to run toward us faster than any human could ever be. That's when we heard a loud noise behind us and a lot of something hit the creature. The old man had come out and started shooting the creature. But the creature didn’t seem to be in pain as it seemed more annoyed than anything. The old man shouted at us to run so we did and as we were running toward our friends we heard another shot get fired and then the old man’s scream. When we got to our friends they asked where we were because they were looking for us and found nothing. So Nate and I had said we would explain later and that we needed to get out. \n\nAs we were running James tripped and started screaming Nate and I already knew what happened but Henry and Steve turned around and stopped. A few seconds later I heard Steve scream and Henry start shouting. When Nate and I arrived to the car we instantly got in and waited to see if anyone else made it back and when we see Henry we were extremely excited so I opened the door and Nate got the car started but then I heard something behind Henry and saw the creature jump and grab him sinking its teeth into his stomach and biting a chunk of his torso off. Seeing his intestines spill everywhere creeped the hell out of me. I quickly closed the car door and told Nate to drive as fast as he could. \n\nA few days passed and my friends’ parents kept coming by to see if I saw them or knew where they were. More people eventually went missing and they were all last seen either in the woods or near them. The rest of the town believes that bears are getting more aggressive or that there is some kind of serial killer on the loose but I know the truth. Anyway a few years later the police finally decided to check the woods a little more than they did the first time. They got a warrant to search all of the old man’s property and when they went deep into the middle of the woods they found almost all of the victims. Apparently they had all been strung up in the trees with their intestines being used to hang them. This finally convinced people that didn’t already believe it that there was a serial killer with the occasional person saying that it was bigfoot or a wendigo etc. Now at least my friends' parents know where their kids are but it brings them more questions than it did answers. \n\nI feel like this was all somehow caused because Nate and I decided to open the shed because there hadn’t been any murders before this. I mean yeah we had the occasional missing person but they all got solved within a week or two. Now the police are trying to figure out who did it and now I’m in and out of the police station because they somehow think Nate and I killed our friends and are now killing other people. All that Nate and I say is that one moment our friends were there and the next they were gone. But the police know we aren’t telling the truth. Everyday I consider going there and telling them but when Nate did that he ended up in the local psychiatric facility. \n\nSomeone was killed inside of their own home. Some people believe that the “serial killer” realized that no one was going to the woods anymore so now they are breaking into people’s houses. But it's so obvious I have no idea how nobody has caught on at this point. There was a huge hole in the wall that no man could make and it wasn’t an explosive because nobody heard it and there wasn’t any black char around the hole. The police found the man dangling from the opening in the attic hung up by, you guessed it, his intestines. \n\nMissing persons numbers are skyrocketing and our town has now been deemed the most dangerous in the state. James’ parents have hired a private investigator to try to finally catch whoever killed their son. I was interviewed by the private investigator and he said that he knows I didn’t do it. I wonder if he really thinks that or if he just wants me to give some information up. \n\nThe private investigator stopped by and told me that he has evidence that I committed the murders and when I asked him to show me he showed a clearly faked video of me killing the victims he said that in a couple days he would have it perfected and he would get credit for solving the case. I did the only thing I could think of which was grab the gun I purchased and then I heard a gunshot and saw him on the ground. I used the very little chemistry I knew from school to destroy his body.\n\nI don’t know why he would fake that footage maybe for publicity? I guess, but now I am the very thing he accused me of being, a murderer. \n\nApparently no one knew where he was and just assumed that the killer was silencing those looking into the case which has now scared the police working on the case into working sloppily. They are afraid that the so-called killer is going to go after them. I never realized that the police in this town were such cowards.\n\nAs I’m typing this the creature is creeping around my house. It has somehow learned how to open doors and fit through them. I’m currently hiding in my attic and I have called the police telling them that the killer is in my home but knowing them they could take a half hour to show up. I can hear it moving right below me and I know that it will find me because my attic doesn’t have a door in the floor, just a ladder and even though it is pulled up I know that it can crawl through. I have my pistol on my desk and a rifle next to me. The only thing illuminating the room is a lamp. The orange glow of the candle inside is making me feel even more alone than I am. I am grabbing the rifle and aiming it at the hole. This is most likely a goodbye as I don’t think I can kill it.\n\nI did it. The creature is dead. I shot it straight in the head with my rifle and it fell, it’s bleeding on the ground right now. \n\nAnother person just went missing.",

        "text": "“**Good evening, folks. This is your Captain speaking. We are expecting some, uh, slight turbulence ahead. Buckle in and hold on tight.**”\n\nI knew something was fucked from the jump. We had not been flying for more than fifteen minutes and yet I could feel the angst in the pilot’s voice. I don’t know how. Maybe it was just my nerves. Maybe it was the inflection on ‘buckle.’ Maybe the gulp after ‘hold on tight.’ Something wasn’t right. \n\n“**Turn off the damn intercom.**”\n\nThat bit sealed it. The captain never cusses. The passengers' gasps all confirmed as much. The flight attendants hustled. Bring the fuckin’ ruckus, my Spotify shuffle agreed, something was about to happen. \n\n\"**Is it off?**\"\n\nI’m home now, I’m safe, somehow. But in that moment it’s easy to condemn yourself for what could have been fatal mistakes. I hated flying. I never would have flown on my own to begin with if my boss didn’t insist on traveling for an off-site. I never would have fought with my wife beforehand if I didn’t have to go in the first place. I shouldn’t *be* here. This shouldn’t be happening to *me*. Shouldn’t somebody see that? Shouldn’t somebody be keeping track? Those thoughts raced through my mind a mile a minute.\n\n\"**Hold it.**\"\n\nThe plane vibrated. People screamed. I couldn’t even bear to look out the window but the slanted horizon line danced across my eyes. A mother in the back row held a wailing infant. I plugged my ears just to block it all out, but it was no use, their voices bled through. \n\n“**Switch the fucking engine, Gill.**”\n\nThe plane dipped. The luggage chutes opened. Oxygen masks deployed. More screaming. A man in a black jacket held on tightly to a little girl with a Paw Patrol blanket. The woman beside me started to pray. I didn’t recognize the religion, or the language, but it felt fitting given the circumstances. I bowed my head in silence. \n\n“**We’re diving. We are diving, Gill.**”\n\nI prayed for my wife. I prayed for my sisters. I prayed for all of the friends and family who would have to bury a box without a body. I knew that would be hard for them. I never planned to die so young. Never saw it coming by a landslide. But in the moment, it felt right, you know? Like it was my time. Like it always meant to go that way. Thousands of feet above the ground without a single loved one by my side and I accepted that my entire world would soon be ripped apart. \n\n“**Spin it, Gill, spin the fuckin’ thing!**”\n\nMy environment became a tornado of body parts and hurled luggage. The drink cart slipped out of the arms of a screaming hostess in first class. The momentum of the spins took it into the air. Hundreds of pounds of hulking metal hurdled across the cabin like a battering ram. Eventually it connected with an older gentleman six rows back. His face exploded on impact. Not everyone saw that, in the chaos, but I did. \n\nAnother stomach wrenching spin brought it back around.\n\n“**One more! We’re almost fucking there. Almost there. Hold it, Gill, spin! SPIN!!**”\n\nJust as suddenly as the action started, it stopped, though the screams certainly did not. The drink cart fell and landed in the aisle. The rogue luggage dropped and smacked some of the passengers in the aisle seats. \n\nThe stewardesses got up and quickly attended to the chaos. \n\nI counted at least five bodies that didn’t move. \n\n“*Hello?*” I asked no one in particular. “*Hwello*”\n\nI tried to speak and the words came out all wrong. I put my finger to my lip and came back with a handful of blood. I didn’t remember getting hit. \n\n“*Sir?*” someone said. \n\n“*Are we still in the air?*” I asked the void. \n\n“*Sir?*” a softer tone this time. \n\nI heard the stewardess’s voice but couldn’t see her face. My waning attention fixated on a point across the cabin.\n\n“Are you okay?”\n\nMost of the passengers shut their side windows at the start of the turbulence. But one of them slipped back open in the chaos. All the way at the end, at the bottom of one in particular, a pale green light shone through. Something about that light drew me like a moth to flame. \n\n“*Do you need medical attention?*”\n\nI unclicked the seatbelt and got up out of my chair. I needed to investigate further. I suppose the window closest to me would have been easier… but the thought never entered my mind. The stewardess followed me, calling out impatiently from behind. \n\n“*Sir? Are you a doctor?*”\n\nI edged past the bloody pools and bewildered folks attending to the numerous injuries through the cabin. The light reflected a rainbow of sorts on the opposing wall. But the formation of the colors was all wrong. \n\n“*Sir. I’m going to have to ask that you sit down.*”\n\nI leaned over a bewildered woman with a gash on her forehead. I heard a commotion as she tried to move out of my way. I didn’t care. I just wanted to see the light. That sweet, beautiful, magnificent light. I had never seen anything like it. I pulled back the window shade. A symphony of blues of grays and pinks erupted through the glass. My skin felt alive, like every pore opened, like every disease disappeared in an instant. \n\n“What is it?” my new seat mate moaned. “It’s wonderful.”\n\nPeople gasped at the beauty of the moment. All of them. \n\n“**Folks. This is your Captain speaking. Forgive me. I don’t quite know how to say this. For the first time ever, humanity has exited this existing plane, and come out of it alive on the other side.**”\n\nAnd then they started to scream.",

        "text": "CKX Broadcast Intrusion\n\nFor a brief period in 1987 I worked as a technician for a television station called CKX-TV in Manitoba. The channel mostly just aired CBC content like Sesame Street, Anne of Green Gables, Babar, and other children shows. At least that’s what they usually aired in the morning and sometimes in the afternoon, I didn’t work at night. \n\nThere was this show called “Not my Department” It was this shitty sitcom about civil servants, it honestly sucked and I don’t recommend anyone watching it. Anyways, it was a late afternoon in November and I was getting ready to leave when some girl working at the station ran up to me as I was putting my mucks on and urged me to go see what was currently being transmitted. I sighed and walked through the hallways of the station and looked at the first television set I saw.\n\nIt was just an average episode of Not my Department and I almost started to chuckle when I saw it, a quick haze of static appeared and slowly dissipated. as the broadcast came back into view it was clear something was off. A man standing in a dim, filthy, garage stood directly in front of the camera. We could only see a bit of his chin as the camera was pointed at his body. He wore a brown jacket and white shirt. Both were very dirty and his faded jeans were dirty too. \n\nHe moved off screen for a moment and came back with a small piece of paper in his hands, he held the paper up to the camera, it was faded and had a yellow tint to it.\n\nHe stood frozen for a few seconds, just holding the paper in front of the camera. After about a minute I could see drops of water falling onto his shirt. About five minutes in he started shaking and whimpering. I just stood in silence with the girl, we both were just in complete shock. The man suddenly moved to the left side of the screen and the screen flashed white three times as three loud bangs were heard. The man slumped down into the corner of the room and it was hard to see him after that because of how dark the room was. The camera started to shake as the camera turned to the right of the room. A chalkboard with the number 8 faced the camera. A black glove came into the screen and rubbed the 8 off the board. It then picked up a piece of chalk and wrote the number 9. \n\n55.03463° N, 97.33854° W\n\nThat’s what the paper read. I’ve been to those coordinates, I went with a couple of coworkers a few days after it happened. I’m making this info public because I can’t stand this guilt eating away at me anymore.\n\nWe had a copy of the incident on VHS, and I watch it regularly with tears in my eyes. Because I know that the number is higher then 9. I know because after a few years my past coworkers from the station started to go missing. \n\nas far as I know this is the first public account of the CKX broadcast intrusion.",

        "text": "They told me there were fairies in the woods, so I looked in places I thought fairies would hide.\n\nI never found them, but that didn’t stop me from searching. I spent afternoons following bugs and inspecting strange-looking trees. I listened to the howling wind, determined to decipher what it was trying to say.\n\nI searched for hours that stretched into days, and I still didn’t find a trace of fairies. I wondered if it had all been a joke.\n\nThis wouldn’t be the first time these boys had lied to me. Joel, Rakeem, Ben, and Matthew. I don’t know if I would call them my friends; they didn’t seem to like me much. I was the strange new girl who had come from the city. I was quiet, and everyone interpreted that as me being stuck up.\n\nThe only person who I was certain liked me and wanted to be my friend was Joel.\n\nJoel was tall and funny, with dark brown hair and ice-blue eyes. I guess you could say I had a crush on him, but it wasn’t only his looks that attracted me; he was genuinely nice.\n\nIf anybody else had spoken of the fairies, I don’t think I would have believed it. But Joel was the one who told me about them, and I knew Joel would never try to trick me.\n\n“The fairies appear,” Joel had said, shaking his hair from his eyes.\n\n“When you need them the most. They sprinkle you with fairy dust and grant you a wish. But be careful what you wish for. Sometimes it’s better to leave things alone.”\n\n“Yeah, because they’ll feed on your blood.” Joel’s brother Matthew chimed in. He smirked at me, and Joel scowled. “It’s how they live, and if you don’t give it to them, they’ll kill you, anyway.”\n\nThe other two boys in the group nodded in agreement.\n\n“They’ll suck out your blood and eat your soul.” Rakeem sneered.\n\n“You’ll owe them forever,” Ben added.\n\nJoel scowled again. “Knock it off, you guys. You’re scaring her.” He turned to me, smiling. “They’re just kidding. Fairies aren’t real, and they definitely don’t want your blood.”\n\nI smiled back. They were scaring me, but I didn’t want to admit that. Not in front of Joel.\n\nSince living in this town, I realized that people here loved their scary stories, and they loved telling them.\n\nI had heard so many stories about witches and talking trees, about the old abandoned farm on the hill. This talk of fairies was a new one, and my stomach fluttered at the thought that they could grant wishes. I could wish for Dad to come back home.\n\nThey could, and they would. I just needed to find them.\n\nThe boys grew bored with telling their stories and went off to climb trees or wade in the water.\n\nI would have joined them usually, but I had an important task. I needed to find the fairies.\n\nThat was all I did that summer.\n\nIt was my first summer without Dad.\n\nA day after we moved, Dad left, and when I asked Mom why, she wouldn’t tell me.\n\nI stopped asking because I knew it hurt her, and she was trying so hard to keep herself together for me.\n\nThis pushed me to find the fairies. I wanted Dad to come back. I wanted Mom happy, and most of all, I wanted back the life that had been taken from me overnight.\n\nI was determined, but looking back now, I realize it was obsession. It was a manifestation of grief. Deep down, I knew he had left for selfish reasons, but I was ten, and I didn’t know the world’s cruelty just yet. I honestly believed that Dad was lost and couldn’t find his way back to us.\n\nSummer was nearly over by the time I found the fairies.\n\nThe night before I did, I heard Mom arguing with someone over the phone. She was crying so hard that her voice distorted, and I stared out my window at the pitch-black sky. I imagined the fairies waiting for me, ready to grant me my wish.\n\nI dreamt of fairies and faraway galaxies that night.\n\nI woke up the next day as the sun was rising. The sky burned like a fever, and cold dew clung to my skin.\n\nI walked through spider webs, and I imagined this was what walking through a ghost would feel like. I pricked my finger on a bush and watched as tiny droplets of blood sprinkled the grass and dirt.\n\nI don’t know what it was about that day that differed from the rest—perhaps it was the strength of my determination or the scent of my blood.\n\nI found the fairies by the river.\n\nThe same river I had searched hundreds of times this summer. At first, I didn’t believe what I saw, but when I pinched myself, my eyes blurred with tears, and the fairies were still there.\n\nThey were real.\n\nThey glided on top of the water and buzzed around weeds and dandelions. They were comprised of all the colors of the rainbow, some colors I had never seen before.\n\nWhat I remember most clearly, though, is the mirth on their lovely faces. Their smiles were stretched into huge grins, and their big black eyes shimmered.\n\nThey paid no attention to me; the young girl crouched behind a rock, too stunned to move.\n\nBut as morning bloomed, I knew I had to say something. Pretty soon, the other kids would be here to play, and they would scare away the fairies I had spent so long looking for. I knew if that happened, I would never see them again, and I would lose my chance of bringing Dad back.\n\nSo I took a deep breath and left my hiding place. I walked as quietly and calmly to the fairies as possible. They noticed me immediately and stopped their prancing. My heartbeat stuttered as they looked at me.\n\nUp close, they were cute, but terrifying.\n\nThey had jagged, sharp teeth that jutted from those broad smiles. Their tiny fingers flexed and revealed long, curling claws.\n\nThey didn’t have eyes, just empty eye sockets. Bugs crawled in and out of them in succession, but even though they were sightless, I knew they could see me.\n\nI hesitated. I hadn’t been expecting this. Don’t be afraid, I told myself. Get your wish.\n\n“I need a wish,” I said, trying to keep the quiver out of my voice. “I need a wish from one of you. You grant wishes, and I need one. I paused. “Please?” I added pitifully.\n\nThey didn’t say anything. They just stared at me, and then slowly turned to one fairy, who hovered above the water.\n\nThis fairy was slightly bigger than the rest. Its wings shimmered pink, gold, and purple, and its teeth were as long as my fingers. Weeds and flowers bloomed from its empty sockets. It was a macabre picture of beauty.\n\n“You want a wish?” It asked in a high, squeaky voice.\n\n“For a wish, what will you give us? What do you offer?”\n\nI was taken aback; I hadn’t expected this. I guess the other boys had been right.\n\nWhat did I have to offer?\n\n“What do you want?” I asked. “I don’t have any money.”\n\nThe fairy was shaking its head and smirking. “What would we do with your human money?” It sneered, and the other fairies laughed. “No, what we want is more valuable than you can imagine.”\n\n“What is it?” I asked, not bothering to conceal the tremble in my voice this time. “What do you want?\n\nThe fairy’s smile widened.\n\n“Your blood smells so sweet. Why don’t you share with us?”\n\nThey laughed again, and I froze. I thought I had misheard, but then the fairy flew towards me so fast I had no time to react.\n\nIt bit my ear with those sharp teeth. The pain was explosive.\n\nI wanted to scream, but I was stunned. I kneeled on the ground, covering my ear, trying to staunch the endless flow of blood. It dripped onto the ground like rain.\n\n“Why did you do that?” I gasped. “What did I do?”\n\nThe fairy just stared at me, its mouth red with blood.\n\n“This is payment for what you want us to do. A small taste is what you’ve given us. For your request, we need more, bigger. More.”\n\nI wanted to cry and run away, but I had gotten this far, and I had been searching for so long. I could hear laughter in the distance, the padding of many feet walking my way.\n\nI had little time, and I knew if I left, I would regret it for the rest of my life. Do this for Mom, I thought. Do this if you want to see Dad again.\n\n“What do you want?” I asked again. “What else can I give you?”\n\nThey said nothing; they just laughed. That was when I heard the rustling behind me, the ecstatic cries of the boys.\n\n“Oh, shit!” One of them cried. “It’s the fairies! She’s talking to the fairies, you guys! They are real.”\n\nI can only remember bits and pieces of that day. The joyful yells turned into blood-curdling screams. I remember seeing blurs of colors that I now associate with death flying past me and covering the boys.\n\nWhat I remember most is sitting by the river. Its water was so saturated with blood that it looked black.\n\nThere was a head bobbing in the rushing water--a head with dark hair and bloody eye sockets--the rest of the body - Joel’s body was mere inches away from where I was sitting.\n\nThat’s where they found me-covered head to toe in blood, rocking back and forth on the river’s bank. I was muttering endlessly about payment and fairies.\n\nI went away for a while. They told me I had had a mental breakdown.\n\nThey called it catatonia.\n\nThe police had concluded that I had nothing to do with the four boys’ deaths. It was impossible, as they had been torn apart and partially eaten. I couldn’t have done it.\n\nThe town didn’t believe in my innocence, however, and neither did I.\n\nIt was my fault; after all, it was all my fault.\n\nI had a recurring dream of a river so dark with blood that it looked black. Joel’s head stared at me with those empty eye sockets. Weeds and flower petals sprouted them made of pink, gold, and purple.\n\nAs time went on, things got worse. I was shunned and endured dark looks and accusations wherever I went. Mom’s job found an excuse to fire her, and everything seemed hopeless.\n\nAnd that’s when Dad came back. He appeared as though he had never left, as though he hadn’t broken my and Mom’s hearts.\n\nHis excuses for leaving made no sense, and although I was happy, he was back; I constantly wondered if it had been worth it in the end. Had he been worth it?\n\nMom wasn’t happy at all. She was pissed, and for months she refused to be in the same room as Dad. What was left of their relationship never recovered.\n\nWe were all ready for a fresh start and made plans to move back to the city. I didn’t mind in the slightest because everywhere, I was reminded of the debt I had paid in flesh and blood.\n\nThe night before we moved, I visited the river one last time. I wanted to say goodbye and tell Joel, Matthew, Ben, and Rakeem that I was sorry. I was so very sorry. In my selfishness, I wanted to believe that apologizing would stop my nightmares. It would prevent me from seeing Joel’s head bobbing in the river, his eye sockets full of blood and blooming flowers.\n\nThe fairies were there, as I knew they would be. They danced under the black sky, glittering like stars, and hovered in the air like fat lightning bugs.\n\nThey laughed and twirled around one another and stopped when they saw me.\n\nThey looked on as the lead fairy fluttered over to me. Its belly was distended and full, and there were eyes jammed into its once-empty eye sockets. They were ice blue.\n\nIt smiled at me and gave a little twirl, raising its tiny arms.\n\nDo you like, is what I interpreted it was asking.\n\nNo, no, I wouldn’t say I liked it at all, I thought, but didn’t dare say.\n\nI still had to thank them. They had granted me my wish, although I knew it wasn’t worth it.\n\n“Thank you,” I whispered. “Thank you for granting my wish.” I fought the urge to touch my ear and run my fingers over that missing chunk of flesh.\n\nThe fairy said nothing.\n\n“Do not seek us again,” it said somberly. “You will not like what we take next.”\n\nI didn’t like what they had taken now. Was it possible for this to get worse?\n\nThe air had shifted noticeably, and the fairies were still staring at me. Their dark eyes were hungry, and without another word, I turned and ran home as fast as possible.\n\nBy the end of the week, we were back in the city. I didn’t dream about the bloody river and Joel every night, but once in a blue moon, I would, and the magnitude of what I had done slapped me in the face.\n\nMy parents are still together, but they aren’t happy.\n\nMom calls me every day to complain about his drinking and the women he cheats on her with. I wish she would leave him, but I know she won’t. I also wish that I had never brought him back. He was cruel and useless, but as a child, I had been too blind to see that.\n\nRegretfully, I have to tell you I followed in Mom’s footsteps. I, too, married a cruel and useless man, but unlike Mom, I won’t complain about it endlessly. I have a plan.\n\nI do not live far from the town where I endured that bloody summer. No, not far at all.\n\nI will find the fairies; I know that they’re still there. Sure, they warned me I should stay away, and I wouldn’t like what they took next, but I have realized that I don’t care.\n\nMy husband has been killing me for years. I died long ago.\n\nI will take him into the woods, and we will dip our toes into the cool water that once had been full of blood.\n\nI will see the fairies once more. I will marvel at how ethereal they look, dancing in the sunlight, twirling in the wind.\n\nThey might kill me, too, I know. In fact I’m positive that they will. But that is okay.\n\nI’ve been dreaming about my death for a while now. I fantasize about how it would feel to have my eyes wrenched from my head. The thought alone fills me with longing. I can’t wait to see them again, and I know they are waiting for me.\n\nI wonder if they will take my eyes.",

A chalkboard with the number 8 faced the camera. A black glove came into the screen and rubbed the 8 off the board. He then picked up a piece of chalk and wrote the number 9. \n\n55.03463° N, 97.33854° W\n\nThat’s what the paper read. I’ve been to those coordinates, I went with a couple of coworkers a few days after it happened. I’m making this info public because I can’t stand this guilt eating away at me anymore.\n\nWe had a copy of the incident on VHS, and I watch it regularly with tears in my eyes. Because I know that the number is higher then 9. I know because after a few years my past coworkers from the station started to go missing. \n\nas far as I know this is the first public account of the CKX broadcast intrusion.",

        "text": "(this is my first attempt at an original horror story so please be kind!)\n\n**Introduction**\n\nIt was the 4th of July, 2019. The fireworks were going off at my neighbour’s house just 2 doors down, so as you can imagine, the noise was excruciatingly annoying.\n\nI looked out the window to see if I could gage any indication of how much longer I would have to sit and suffer. I unlocked my sliding glass window and lifted it as high as it could go, all the while holding back my inner rage, and peered out toward my neighbour’s garden.\n\nAs I dipped my head out into the warm July air, I heard a loud *crack* right next to my ear. I raised my hand to my head as I grimaced in pain. A loud, constant ringing began to emerge, taking over the consciousness of my brain. I could feel the control of my body, slowly slipping out of my grip, as I tumbled out of the window and onto the concrete patio below.\n\n**Chapter 1**\n\n“Wh- where am I?”\n\nAll I heard was silence, followed by a deep rumble of sound waves piercing my ear drums. I could tell it was a person’s voice, but I couldn’t quite make out the words.\n\n“He’s awake! Oh my god he’s actually awake!” \n\nThe words were muffled, barely intelligible, but I could just about make out my sister’s tone of voice. The panic and urgency in her voice filled me with dread, but I simply didn’t have the energy to show any emotion.\n\nA man in a long white coat then appeared before me with a big cheesy grin on his face.\n\n“Welcome back buddy.”\n\nThe words created a strange deep buzzing effect, penetrating my brain and filling me with rage once more.\n\n“What happened to me?”\n\nI could remember the fireworks and even remember falling out of the window, but I had no recollection of how I got here.\n\nI was sprawled out on a small hospital bed, with what seemed like 50 wires wrapped and contorted around my body. Bright flashing lights pierced my eyes as if they hadn’t seen the light of day in years. \n\n“You’re in the hospital Matt. You had an accident, but everything’s okay now.”\n\nThe doctor spoke in a condescending yet narcissistic tone, as if I were a child he had saved from a burning building and he was the hero… and didn’t he wanted me to know it. \n\nAlthough I could understand the words, they were still muffled and difficult to comprehend. The doctor mentioned something else, his tone slightly more serious in nature.\n\n“Sorry, what did you say?”\n\n\\*Inaudible muffled sounds\\*\n\nThe doctor’s face had changed from a lovesick puppy to that of a disciplined soldier, as he rushed out of the room with one mission on his mind.\n\nI looked to my sister who appeared incredibly concerned. Her face was white, and eyes wide. I noticed my mum standing next to her, she looked exhausted. Yet through the dark circles around her eyes, I was able to notice they too were huge, and filled with worry.\n\nJust as I was about to speak, a nurse sprung into the room with a strange tool in hand. She stared deeply into my eyes upon entering the room and hurried over to the side of my bed. The last thing I remember, was the thrust of the sharp tool viciously sliding into my left ear drum, almost as if it was injecting pure anxiety and dread directly into my brain. \n\n**Chapter 2**\n\n\\*Thudding noises\\*\n\nMy eye lids burst open once more as a pulsating, thud threw itself at me. I followed the vibrations, and they led my sight to my bathroom door which stood closed with a constant tremor, almost as if someone, or something was trying to get out.\n\nIt was at this moment I realised; I was no longer in the hospital. \n\nInstinctively I rose to my feet, flinging my bed covers onto the floor and grabbing the first thing I could find. I now found myself in a stand-off, and my weapon of choice… a plastic nightlight, which still remained on my bedside table despite years of telling myself to get rid of it. I guess deep down, I never did move on from my fear of the dark.\n\nA loud bang caused the bathroom door the shudder in terror, causing me to reactively take a step forward. I was violently pulled back by the trapped nightlight wire still plugged into its socket which brought me to the floor, landing directly on my lower back. The pain was excruciating, but I couldn’t take my focus away from the whatever darkness was lurking behind that door.\n\nI jumped to my feet and lunged towards my wardrobe. I kept a baseball bat hidden down the side for emergencies. Not that I would have been very effective against anyone with it, I couldn’t even make my school’s reserve team last year. But at the very least, my small 5”7 frame would appear more menacing to whatever was in my bathroom if I had some sort of actual weapon.\n\nI slowly approached the bathroom door, beads of sweat dropping onto the bed covers that laid beneath my feet. When all of a sudden, the thudding sound stopped. \n\nAs I lifted the baseball bat above my head, I took three more steps forward, nervously gulping as my focus switched to turning the bathroom door handle. I gripped handle with my left hand and began to slowly turn it without creating too much noise. I felt the click of the door latch exiting the door frame throughout my entire body. \n\nImpulsively, I flung the door open, immediately killing the suspense that was building up inside of me. But what was awaiting me on the other side of that door, I could never have been prepared for. What I saw standing before me, could only be described as the encapsulation of absolute terror in its purest form.\n\n**PLEASE READ:**\n\n**If you would like to use this story in any projects, please DM me first!

        "text": "School was always a big struggle for me, I never liked school. My dreams of going to Harvard were flushed down the toilet. My grades weren't awful but they were bad enough for me to never have anything above a 3.4 GPA.\n\nI always doubted myself for it, people told me I should be happy with the grades I got because some kids couldn't even get anything above a 2.0 GPA. I never listened though, I always thought I could do better.\n\nIt doesn't help I am a big sleeper in school. I always would get sent to the office or forced to stand up for the rest of class because I was constantly falling asleep. My parents have gotten multiple complaints about this behavior of mine but no matter what they tried they never could fix the problem.\n\nWhile sitting in my least favorite subject in school, Algebra 1, I started to dose off like I usually do. I dreamt about my dreams of going to Harvard and actually getting into the school and my father for once telling me he is proud of me. A dream I dreamt about quite often, but as the dream was starting to get good, I woke up. I was unsatisfied that once again, the dream wasn't real.\n\nAs I start to look around the room I felt like my stomach dropped. The room was dark, empty, and for some reason really cold.\n\nIt wasn't until I looked at my desk I noticed a note on the desk. As I was about to read it I heard a noise outside the classroom and into the hallway. I couldn't move, I was too terrified to make a sound.\n\nSo many thoughts were going through my mind. \"Why didn't anyone wake me up, what was that sound, is any of this real, why did everyone just leave me to sleep, why didn't my parents come to get me?\"\n\nSo many thoughts ran through my mind, and the noises got louder. I had to act fast, I grabbed the piece of paper and went to hide under the teacher's desk. You might be thinking to yourself, \"why didn't you just go out there, maybe it is just the janitor?\"\n\nIf you even asked yourself that, you would be the first to get killed in a horror movie. I watched too many horror movies to know something is not right about all of this. The noises didn't sound too friendly either, it sounded very loud, like metal scraping lockers. The sound only got louder and louder until it reached the door.\n\nThe door was closed and locked, one more reason all of this isn't right. If the door is closed and locked then that means the teacher had time to wake me up but instead locked her classroom door and left me in there.\n\nI was too invested in my thoughts that I realize the noise has stopped for a good while. After around 10 minutes I get up and find a way out of the school. I realize I could break a window but that would create too much noise. There were no extra doors in the room, only one to exit the room and enter.\n\nI finally look at the note and resort to that. I open the piece of paper and I read the following.\n\n\"Dear Nick, you fell asleep in class again like usual. You won't wake up, however, and you were taken to the hospital. Everything you see, hear, or experience is all fake. You are in a coma, but this isn't a normal coma. Every 5 years the school we attend takes 1 student who is asleep in class and puts them into a coma. If you want to escape you have to follow these rules. Don't think of these as rules, think of them as a guide. If you want to make it out alive then please read these rules and DO NOT BREAK A SINGLE ONE.\"\n\n\"Rule 1: Everything that happens to you isn't real, but the pain will feel real. Don't think just because it isn't real that everything else isn't real. Dying in the coma means dying in real life, do not die with the exception of breaking rule 2.\"\n\n\"Rule 2: If you hear the scraping of metal in the hallways, DO NOT INVESTIGATE. Believe me, dying would be better than getting caught by it. If you are dumb enough to investigate, kill yourself. The fate is much worse if it catches you.\"\n\n\"Rule 3: You will see a little girl in the hallway blocking your path at one point. If you see her, pay attention to her. If she walks towards you, run as fast as you can into the girl's restroom and whatever you do, don't look back. If she waves at you, you are safe to pass her. Do not look at her in the eyes at all costs, if you do look her in the eyes, then follow rule 5.\"\n\n\"Rule 4: Time is not the same as our time in the real world. The only times in the coma are 2-3 am. If the time at any point on your phone doesn't say these times, then hide in a locker and change the time to somewhere between 2- 3 am. When you come out, hope you did this in time. If not, then you will have to deal with the consequences. The longer you took, the worse the consequences are.\"\n\n\"Rule 5: If you encounter the little girl from rule 3 in a classroom don't run, fight back. Trust me, your chances of survival are nothing if you run, fighting will at least give you the opportunity to escape.\"\n\n\"Rule 6: If you hear the school alarms go off, run into the principal's office and quickly shut it off. Her password is District7384.\"\n\n\"Rule 7: This is the most important rule and will get you out of here. If you haven't already figured it out, you can't break any doors or windows. There will be one window however that will open at a random time. When you see this window open, discard any rules you may be currently encountering or are about to encounter. Crawl through the window and go outside and run away from the school, don't stop running until you see a light. When you see the light go it and you will wake up.\"\n\n\"I am running out of space so follow this last rule it is super important. Don't trust anyone.\"\n\n\"Don't trust anyone?\" I thought to myself.\n\nThis was all so much to take it. I had so many questions yet so little time to plan. Rule 2 happened and thankfully I trusted my instincts. I decided to finally stop killing time and decided to get out of the classroom.\n\nThe note seemed rushed at the end, I don't know what is happening. I walk down the hall and check my phone, \"1:59 am,\" I started to wonder how this person knew what to do and what rules to write. I walk down the hall but then it hit me. I check my phone again and the time remains at 1:59, I hop into a locker and proceed to change the time. After changing it to 2 am I wait for a good 2 minutes before exiting the lockers.\n\nI stepped out of the locker, I seemed to of followed the rule just in time but the school changed its appearance however. The walls were now more run down and the school looked a bit more abandoned. I assumed this had something to do with rule 4.\n\nWhat creeped me out the most is the fact the walls and hallways and the school overall seemed a little more abandoned but not the lockers. The lockers if anything just looked brand new.\n\nI look around the school for the light the note spoke about, I was lost in my thoughts. The fact all of this was not real, yet felt so real really messed with me. As I search for the light, I enter a hallway and see the girl at least 4 feet away from me. I froze and forgot what to do, she was just walking towards me.\n\nI just stood there until my fight or flight kicked in, I ran away as fast as I could. I finally remembered that this was in the rules, thankfully I did the right thing. I found the bathroom and ran inside, I went into the one stall with a toilet. The toilet was uncleaned and gross, and the school always complained about us boys not aiming well enough. I had to step on the lid even if it meant having disgusting shoes.\n\nAfter not hearing anything for a while, I left the stall and used this time to use the restroom. After washing my hands I looked into the bathroom mirror and noticed a tall man right behind me. I was about to turn around until I realized I was paralyzed. No I mean I was physically paralyzed, I couldn't move an inch of my body.\n\nThe bathroom was dark with no light but from a singular flickering light. After each flicker, his grin got wider as he inched closer to my ear. The man then told me, \"there is another way out of here you know, the light isn't the only way out. Follow me, I will guide you out of here.\"\n\nI could move again, but the man was exiting the bathroom. I was quick to think, I followed him out of the bathroom but I didn't follow the man and the direction he was going. I knew he was just trying to lure me out into a trap. After all, the note said not to trust anyone.\n\nAn hour goes by, I encountered rules 6, 4, and 2. They were fairly not too difficult to deal with, but then I encountered the girl in a classroom I walked in. When I walked in she stared at me at first and then started giggling nonstop. Then her giggling turned into a demonic screeching as her arms extended at an impossible amount. The door magically shuts behind me with great force. She was trying to grab me, but all I could do was dodge and run around the classroom. But, no matter how fast I ran she was also an inch closer every time I looked back.\n\nFinally, I stopped and spun around and punched her in the nose. She stopped screaming and stood there, just a few inches from my face. I use this time to grab a nearby yardstick and break it in half across her face. I then impale the broken yardstick into her stomach.\n\nIt shouldn't have been possible for me to impale her with a yardstick, the end of the broken wood wasn't even sharp. It was apparently enough though, the girl just vanishes right in front of me. I run out of the room and have a breakdown. It felt like I have been trapped here for hours. Hell, maybe I have been trapped for days or weeks, even years.\n\nI walk around the school until I notice an open window. I waste no time and run to it and crawl out. Fresh air hit my nostrils and for once I felt like everything was going to be ok.\n\nI run in a straight line away from the school, I hear something behind me matching my sprinting speed. I look behind me to see not the girl, but a creature that to this day still haunts me. Do you know the short animated horror story, \"I heard it too.\"\n\nThe creature behind me was identical to the monster in the story. It could stretch its neck, jaw, arms, legs, and any body part to an impossible amount. The creepiest part was the thing that is chasing me looked exactly like the kid who went missing in our area exactly 5 years ago.\n\nI looked back in front of me and ran faster, I was starting to run out of breath. Just as I thought I was about to collapse I make it into the light. Everything starts to get really bright and then... darkness. I wake up in a hospital with my family and friends surrounding me. My mom screams to the doctor that I am awake. I hug my friends and family as they all gather around me. For the first time in a while, I am happy I am with my friends and family and out of that hell hole.\n\nAs I hug them I shut my eyes and cry, but then I can't feel them anymore. In fact, it has gone strangely silent and I can tell the room got darker. I open my eyes and find myself in the same classroom I started in. I panic and wonder how this is possible, I did everything right... right?\n\nI notice the note and open it, but this time there is a new message.\n\n\"You went into the boys' bathroom, not the girls' :)\"",

        "text": "‘Chicken’, that petulant taunt is what sticks in my mind, why did I have to rise to the bait. My once simple existence has now been consumed by chaos, all due to that small, single, seemingly insignificant fucking word. If I’m going to relive these nightmarish memories, I’m taking you with me.\n\nIt was October 27th 2007, the days were growing shorter and the nights grew ever longer. I’m Benjamin by the way but everyone calls me Ben. Being your typical 18 year old, I would normally spend my evenings in my room on windows messenger with my friends Paulo, Tyler, Sarah and Dani. We all attended the same college together four days a week. The rest of the time we used to hang out on the grounds of a long time closed and decaying private School, situated at the end of a single track road called Charter Lane. We would meet up with a few other groups of people that we knew from college in the unused run down playground. Someone would be inevitably playing music off a small tin sounding portable speaker. We would bring a couple of crates of beer and some cheap ass vodka that tasted more like paint stripper to fuel our fun.\n\nKyle was one of the guys that would always be here, like one of them people that were ‘always out’ if you know what I mean. He would frequently climb onto the old school building and clamber through a small skylight window to grab cans of drink and snacks from the abandoned vending machines inside. He would always come out looking all smug, like he’d just won money from a slot machine. This was except for that one night, yeah this is where my nightmare begins. \n\nThere was only five of us and Kyle over at the playground that Saturday night, the girls Sarah and Dani, were chatting half way up the blue paint peeled climbing frame with Paulo. Him and Sarah had been having a thing for about the last 3 months, they hadn’t said anything but we all knew about it. Me, Tyler and Kyle were sat around a small flickering fire, that was barely keeping lit in the chilled October breeze. Each  one of us passing a small joint around to aid in our attempt to keep warm. \n\nKyle stood up.\n\n“You know what time it is guys!” He said trying to contain his excitement. \n\nI gazed up to him, “go on then spidey!” I chuckled sarcastically.\n\nDani shouted over “get some chocolate for me this time Kyle, please!”\n\nHe turned, pulled the hood of his red hoodie over his head and gave her a quick wink “of course babe, anything for you”.\n\nShe held her hands up in a heart shape and announced “My hero!”\n\nAs he faded from the fire-lit glow, I could see him proceed to a small wall next to the building, he jumped up and hoisted himself up onto the flat roof above. His faint outline seemed to evaporate into the darkness. We were now one  crate and half bottle of vodka into our night. It had been about 20 minutes since Kyle had gone in to the school and he still hadn’t emerged. We were all sat around the fire trying to scare each other about the history of the school, the rumours of past murders and torture were rife in our area.   \n\n“Kyle is normally back by now, it’s been like 20 minutes” Tyler interrupted. \n\n“What are you his mother?”Dani said in between sipping the dwindling bottle of vodka.\n“He probs just went to a different machine, don’t worry” she continued.\n\nWe all paused for a minute as if all in deep thought of where Kyle could be, only the slight crackle of the fire sounding in our ears. The silence was shattered with an uncontrollable horrific scream, coming from inside the school. \n\nIt was Kyle. \n\n“What the fuck was that” Sarah breathed from her hand covered mouth.\n\n“That’s Kyle, shit maybe he’s hurt” Paulo responded. \n\nWe all got up and started walking towards the desolate structure. We began calling out for Kyle. \n\n “Stop messing around dude and get back out here” I yelled.\n\nOur cries were met only by eerie deafening silence. \n\n“Right, fuck it, I’m going in” Tyler confidently stated. \n\nPaulo followed with “we should all go in,  come on it’ll be easier to search the place with 5 of us”. I saw him give Sarah a quick wink from the corner of my eye. \n\nI quickly tried to rationalise the situation.\n\n“I think we should stay out here, at least wait for 5 or 10 minutes, if he’s not out by then we  can call someone for help”. \n\nTyler smugly replied “What’s wrong Ben, Chicken?”\n\n“If your too chicken Ben, you can stay out here while we go in” Dani said while placing her arm around Tyler. \n\n“I ain’t no chicken, come on let’s go” I responded pushing Paulo out of the way, I then proceeded to climb onto the roof and down the open window. I helped the others down, one by one until we were standing in a large corridor. I had a small flashlight in my coat pocket, luckily I had remembered it before I left. Paulo also had one with him in has small Nike bag, that thing always seemed be attached to him. \n\nThe corridor was blank and hollow, it reminded me of the halls throughout a hospital only the floors were littered with old books and pieces of broken ceiling panels. We decided to split up as we didn’t know which way Kyle would have gone, none of us had been inside the school before. We all found it odd that we didn’t hear another noise since the initial scream. \nPaulo went off behind us with Sarah, then Me, Tyler and Dani went in the opposite direction. We walked past about half a dozen old classrooms. The ones we could see into were trashed, not even a chair was upright. There must have been people living in here at one point due to the stained single mattresses and discarded food wrappings on the floors. \n\n“It’s amazing there was anything left in them vending machines” I said trying to lighten the tense mood. \n\n“Yeah true, there probably hidden away somewhere” Dani responded.\n\nWe all came to a abrupt halt, there was a faint squeaking sound coming from up ahead. It sounded like an old wheel in dire need of some oil. I lifted my flashlight and illuminated the passage ahead. The sinister sound stopped but i could hear what sounded like white noise coming from one of the rooms in front of us. \n\n“What the fuck is that?” I whispered to Tyler and Dani.\n\n“It’s probably Kyle fucking with us” Tyler said before shouting “Hello, Kyle, we know it’s you, stop messing around man!”\n\nThe steady squeaking started again with the white noise accompanying it. Emerging from one of the open doors further ahead rolled an old static screened tv on a metal trolley, the power cable trailing behind it. We all took the same deep gasp as the cable sprung out of the room as the screen turned to a black glow.\n\nTyler now with fear in his voice shouted “Kyle, stop being a dick, this ain’t funny anymore!”\n\nHe snatched the flashlight from my grasp and marched up to the room that where the TV had come from. We followed behind him and scoured our eyes around the now lit room. No one was in there, no cupboards or rooms to hide, just nothing but scattered wooden debris. The goosebumps started to form on my arms as a chill fell upon us.\n\nDani muttered “I want to get out of here, I don’t like it, I want to go home”. \n\nTyler discounting the last few minutes snapped back “it’s Kyle, he is trying to scare the shit out of us”\n\nDani nodded her head while stuttering “OK, I just don’t like it here”\n\nI was freaked out and I had the same thoughts running through my head as Dani but I wasn’t going to leave my friends alone in here. \nTyler passed me back our only light source, as we hesitantly carried on down the corridor. A couple of minutes later we heard what sounded like hushed muffled footsteps that were running behind us. I pointed the flashlight from where we had just come from. There was nothing there but the heavy fast paced steps where getting louder, which could only mean they were getting closer. We were just about to run when Paulo came into sight.\n\n“Guys, stop, wait” he shouted trying to catch his breath. \n\n“What’s wrong? Did you find Kyle?” Dani responded, I could tell in her voice that she wanted this night to be over. \n\nOnly finding Kyle would mean that we could leave. \n\n“No, I can’t find Sarah, she was right behind me”\n\nPaulo then proceeded to then tell us how they had blown off the search and found a room for some alone time. They were on their way back to us, when he heard a thud followed by a dragging noise behind him. He searched the rooms around him but she was gone, she had just vanished. \n\nMy apprehension was now only growing with every minute that we were in this tormenting school. We all decided to walk back and look for Sarah, she may have just wandered off or left even. \n\n“Here, this is where we were” Paulo stated, I could see the anxiety in his eyes. \n\n“Listen, do you hear that?” Dani whispered behind me.\n\nIt sounded like a dripping tap coming from the room up ahead. \nTyler once again took the flashlight from me and said,\n\n“Let me have a look”.\n\nHe walked slowly up to the crumbled opening and cast the light into the room.\n\n“Fuck!” He winced while flinching his body away. \n\n“What’s wrong?!” Paulo asked, the concern in his voice was harrowing as he walked towards Tyler.\n\nHis head turned and he fell to his knees, through flowing tears as he uttered “no, Sarah”. \n\nMe and Dani nervously walked up to Paulo and Tyler, there sat in a wooden chair was what was left of Sarah. The drip of her crimson blood fell from her hand as it dangled beside her. Dani screamed and buried her head into my chest as she started to weep. I felt a combination of numbing pain and sickness. Who would even do this? I asked myself just as my thoughts were interrupted by Tyler, who said while giving me back my flashlight. \n\n“This has to be Kyle, that sick motherfucker” the anger in his voice seemed to snap Paulo from his wailing trance. \n\n“I’m going to fucking kill him” Paulo snarled while fighting back his tears.\n\nWe all in that moment thought the same thing, how well did we actually know Kyle?\nA whistle echoed from the darkness ahead, our gaze altered in unison. \n\nTyler announced “it’s him, come on guys, let’s get him”.\n\nTyler and Paulo started running down the corridor forwards the whistling.\n\n“Tyler, Paulo, wait up!” I shouted as their flashlights faded around the tight bend ahead. \n\nThe whistling abruptly stopped.\n\n“What the fuck!” I heard Tyler shout as I pulled Dani round the corner with me. \nI heard the painful scream of Paulo as I engulfed the walkway in light. Just in time to see Paulo’s legs and boots slowly slip into a room up ahead. A smeared trail of blood followed him starting at the planted feet of Tyler. He was stood, unlit flashlight in hand covered in the splattered blood of Paulo. \n\n“What the fuck happened man?!” I yelled at Tyler. \nHis face stared blankly at me, his hands shook uncontrollably as he struggled to say the words.\n \n“The flashlight turned off, I felt something brush across me and then I heard his cries” he said while tears now started forming in his eyes. His previous confident demeanour had been replaced by a broken, fear stricken shell of his former self. \nA laugh rang around us, it bounced off the cracked walls as it droned off into the shadowy depths behind us. I directed the flashlight towards the source of the menacing cackle, there was a pile of debris that ran across the hall further up. What I saw next made my blood run cold, facing the wall at the end of this seemingly never ending corridor stood Kyle. He was wearing the same trainers, ripped jeans and red hoodie. He was writing a strange language in what I can only assume was blood on the wall, Paulo’s lifeless body laying by his feet. \n\n“K-K-Kyle?” I called out, hoping for a reasonable answer to what was going on. \n\nHe stopped writing, his arm slowly dropped beside him. \n\n“Kyle please, what ever is going on let us help” Dani cried out beside me. \n\nA rolling crunch followed as Kyle’s head fell backwards between his shoulder blades.

Me and Dani slowed as we realised, this was quickly followed by the sound of ripped clothing and the horrific deafening sounds of Tylers last breath.

I moved a chair into position underneath and pulled myself out. I began to pull her up as I felt a sudden resistance as Dani started screaming, smoke filled the opening making it difficult to see what was happening. I used the last of my strength to pull, she immediately became lighter. I looked down, her eyes grew wide and blood trickled from her gapping mouth. That’s when I noticed, her torso had been ripped in half. \n“I’m so sorry” I sobbed as my grip loosened and she fell back into the plume of black smoke. I closed the window and jumped from the roof, I heard a crunch from underneath me as I landed.

        "text": "‘Chicken’, that petulant taunt is what sticks in my mind, why did I have to rise to the bait. My once simple existence has now been consumed by chaos, all due to that small, single, seemingly insignificant fucking word. If I’m going to relive these nightmarish memories, I’m taking you with me.\n\nIt was October 27th 2007, the days were growing shorter and the nights grew ever longer. I’m Benjamin by the way but everyone calls me Ben. Being your typical 18 year old at the time, I would normally spend my evenings in my room on windows messenger with my friends Paulo, Tyler, Sarah and Dani. We all attended the same college together four days a week. The rest of the time we used to hang out on the grounds of a long time closed and decaying private School, situated at the end of a single track road called Charter Lane. We would meet up with a few other groups of people that we knew from college in the unused run down playground. Someone would be inevitably playing music off a small tin sounding portable speaker. We would bring a couple of crates of beer and some cheap ass vodka that tasted more like paint stripper to fuel our fun.\n\nKyle was one of the guys that would always be here, like one of them people that were ‘always out’ if you know what I mean. He would frequently climb onto the old school building and clamber through a small skylight window to grab cans of drink and snacks from the abandoned vending machines inside. He would always come out looking all smug, like he’d just won money from a slot machine. This was except for that one night, yeah this is where my nightmare begins. \n\nThere was only five of us and Kyle over at the playground that Saturday night, the girls Sarah and Dani, were chatting half way up the blue paint peeled climbing frame with Paulo. Him and Sarah had been having a thing for about the last 3 months, they hadn’t said anything but we all knew about it. Me, Tyler and Kyle were sat around a small flickering fire, that was barely keeping lit in the chilled October breeze. Each  one of us passing a small joint around to aid in our attempt to keep warm. \nKyle stood up.\n“You know what time it is guys!” He said trying to contain his excitement. \nI gazed up to him, “go on then spidey!” I chuckled sarcastically.\nDani shouted over “get some chocolate for me this time Kyle, please!”\nHe turned, pulled the hood of his red hoodie over his head and gave her a quick wink “of course babe, anything for you”\nShe held her hands up in a heart shape and announced “My hero!”\nAs he faded from the fire-lit glow, I could see him proceed to a small wall next to the building, he jumped up and hoisted himself up onto the flat roof above. His faint outline seemed to evaporate into the darkness. We were now one  crate and half bottle of vodka into our night. It had been about 20 minutes since Kyle had gone in to the school and he still hadn’t emerged. We were all sat around the fire trying to scare each other about the history of the school, the rumours of past murders and torture were rife in our area.   \n“Kyle is normally back by now, it’s been like 20 minutes” Tyler interrupted. \n“What are you his mother?”Dani said in between sipping the dwindling bottle of vodka.\n“He probs just went to a different machine, don’t worry” she continued.\nWe all paused for a minute as if all in deep thought of where Kyle could be, only the slight crackle of the fire sounding in our ears. The silence was shattered with an uncontrollable horrific scream, coming from inside the school. \nIt was Kyle. \n“What the fuck was that” Sarah breathed from her hand covered mouth.\n“That’s Kyle, shit maybe he’s hurt” Paulo responded. \nWe all got up and started walking towards the desolate structure. We began calling out for Kyle. \n “Stop messing around dude and get back out here” I yelled.\nOur cries were met only by eerie deafening silence. \n“Right, fuck it, I’m going in” Tyler confidently stated. \nPaulo followed with “we should all go in,  come on it’ll be easier to search the place with 5 of us”. I saw him give Sarah a quick wink from the corner of my eye. \nI quickly tried to rationalise the situation.\n“I think we should stay out here, at least wait for 5 or 10 minutes, if he’s not out by then we  can call someone for help”. \nTyler smugly replied “What’s wrong Ben, Chicken?”\n“If your too chicken Ben, you can stay out here while we go in” Dani said while placing her arm around Tyler. \n“I ain’t no chicken, come on let’s go” I responded pushing Paulo out of the way, I then proceeded to climb onto the roof and down the open window. I helped the others down, one by one until we were standing in a large corridor. I had a small flashlight in my coat pocket, luckily I had remembered it before I left. Paulo also had one with him in has small Nike bag, that thing always seemed be attached to him. \n\nThe corridor was blank and hollow, it reminded me of the halls throughout a hospital only the floors were littered with old books and pieces of broken ceiling panels. We decided to split up as we didn’t know which way Kyle would have gone, none of us had been inside the school before. We all found it odd that we didn’t hear another noise since the initial scream. \nPaulo went off behind us with Sarah, then Me, Tyler and Dani went in the opposite direction. We walked past about half a dozen old classrooms. The ones we could see into were trashed, not even a chair was upright. There must have been people living in here at one point due to the stained single mattresses and discarded food wrappings on the floors. \n\n“It’s amazing there was anything left in them vending machines” I said trying to lighten the tense mood. \n“Yeah true, there probably hidden away somewhere” Dani responded.\nWe all came to a abrupt halt, there was a faint squeaking sound coming from up ahead. It sounded like an old wheel in dire need of some oil. I lifted my flashlight and illuminated the passage ahead. The sinister sound stopped but i could hear what sounded like white noise coming from one of the rooms in front of us. \n“What the fuck is that?” I whispered to Tyler and Dani.\n\n“It’s probably Kyle fucking with us” Tyler said before shouting “Hello, Kyle, we know it’s you, stop messing around man!”\n\nThe steady squeaking started again with the white noise accompanying it. Emerging from one of the open doors further ahead rolled an old static screened tv on a metal trolley, the power cable trailing behind it. We all took the same deep gasp as the cable sprung out of the room as the screen turned to a black glow.\n\nTyler now with fear in his voice shouted “Kyle, stop being a dick, this ain’t funny anymore!”\nHe snatched the flashlight from my grasp and marched up to the room that where the TV had come from. We followed behind him and scoured our eyes around the now lit room. No one was in there, no cupboards or rooms to hide, just nothing but scattered wooden debris. The goosebumps started to form on my arms as a chill fell upon us.\nDani muttered “I want to get out of here, I don’t like it, I want to go home”. \nTyler discounting the last few minutes snapped back “it’s Kyle, he is trying to scare the shit out of us”\nDani nodded her head while stuttering “OK, I just don’t like it here”\nI was freaked out and I had the same thoughts running through my head as Dani but I wasn’t going to leave my friends alone in here. \nTyler passed me back our only light source, as we hesitantly carried on down the corridor. A couple of minutes later we heard what sounded like hushed muffled footsteps that were running behind us. I pointed the flashlight from where we had just come from. There was nothing there but the heavy fast paced steps where getting louder, which could only mean they were getting closer. We were just about to run when Paulo came into sight.\n“Guys, stop, wait” he shouted trying to catch his breath. \n“What’s wrong? Did you find Kyle?” Dani responded, I could tell in her voice that she wanted this night to be over. Only finding Kyle would mean that we could leave. \n“No, I can’t find Sarah, she was right behind me”\nPaulo then proceeded to tell us how they had blown off the search and found a room for some alone time. They were on their way back to us, when he heard a thud followed by a dragging noise behind him. He searched the rooms around him but she was gone, she had just vanished. \n\nMy apprehension was now only growing with every minute that we were in this tormenting school. We all decided to walk back and look for Sarah, she may have just wandered off or left even. \n“Here, this is where we were” Paulo stated, I could see the anxiety in his eyes. \n“Listen, do you hear that?” Dani whispered behind me. It sounded like a dripping tap coming from the room up ahead. \nTyler once again took the flashlight from me and said,\n“Let me have a look”,\nHe walked slowly up to the crumbled opening and cast the light into the room.\n“Fuck!” He winced while flinching his body away. \n“What’s wrong?!” Paulo asked, the concern in his voice was harrowing as he walked towards Tyler.\nHis head turned and he fell to his knees, through flowing tears as he uttered “no, Sarah”. \nMe and Dani nervously walked up to Paulo and Tyler, there sat in a wooden chair was what was left of Sarah. The drip of her crimson blood fell from her hand as it dangled beside her. Dani screamed and buried her head into my chest as she started to weep. I felt a combination of numbing pain and sickness. Who would even do this? I asked myself just as my thoughts were interrupted by Tyler, who said while giving me back my flashlight. \n“This has to be Kyle, that sick motherfucker” the anger in his voice seemed to snap Paulo from his wailing trance. \n“I’m going to kill him” Paulo snarled while fighting back his tears.\nWe all in that moment thought the same thing, how well did we actually know Kyle?\nA whistle echoed from the darkness ahead, our gaze altered in unison. \nTyler announced “it’s him, come on guys, let’s get him”.\nTyler and Paulo started running down the corridor forwards the whistling.\n“Tyler, Paulo, wait up!” I shouted as their flashlights faded around the tight bend ahead. \nThe whistling abruptly stopped.\n“What the fuck!” I heard Tyler shout as I pulled Dani round the corner with me. \nI heard the painful scream of Paulo as I engulfed the walkway in light. Just in time to see Paulo’s legs and boots slowly slip into a room up ahead. A smeared trail of blood followed him starting at the planted feet of Tyler. He was stood, unlit flashlight in hand covered in the splattered blood of Paulo. \n“What the fuck happened man?!” I yelled at Tyler. \nHis face stared blankly at me, his hands shook uncontrollably as he struggled to say the words \n“The flashlight turned off, I felt something brush across me and then I heard his cries” he said while tears now started forming in his eyes. His previous confident demeanour had been replaced by a broken, fear stricken shell of his former self. \nA laugh rang around us, it bounced off the cracked walls as it droned off into the shadowy depths behind us. I directed the flashlight towards the source of the menacing cackle, there was a pile of debris that ran across the hall further up. What I saw next made my blood run cold, facing the wall at the end of this seemingly never ending corridor stood Kyle. He was wearing the same trainers, ripped jeans and red hoodie. He was writing a strange language in what I can only assume was blood on the wall, Paulo’s lifeless body laying by his feet. \n\n“K-K-Kyle?” I called out, hoping for a reasonable answer to what was going on. \nHe stopped writing, his arm slowly dropped beside him. \n“Kyle please, what ever is going on let us help” Dani cried out beside me. \nA rolling crunch followed as Kyle’s head fell backwards between his shoulder blades. We all jolted back in pure disgust as we stared into his glazed, clouded eyes. His face was grey, populated with raised blue branching veins. Deep red blood slowly flowed from his nose and eyes. He spoke words from is foamed mouth in a language we didn’t understand. \n\n“Moriatur, auferam caput tuum. Bibe humores de corpore exanimo, et carpe dentes meos ossibus tuis.”\n\nMy knees buckled from fear, we all  knew that we had messed up bad, we should have left here after we saw that rogue TV wheel itself into our path. We all turned and ran, we could hear a fourth set of running footsteps in the deathly dark behind us. I heard a scuff and a smack behind me, Tyler had tripped over a chair.

        "text": "I should say I did not believe in the paranormal at all at first, but now, anything is possible. Tell me what you think it could be\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n A few months ago, I saw something I cannot explain. I created a Reddit account just so I could tell this story without being looked at like I'm out of my mind. It was a Saturday in October, about noon. I was with some of my friends and colleagues at a theme park called Kings Island. It is a wonderful place, very high quality, actually has been upvoted as America's favorite theme park on more than one occasion. But, while me and my friends where having fun, feeling like kids again, something, without us knowing, was watching and listening. I was the first one to feel it, I thought I was insane at first, but, I'm not sure anymore. I just felt very uneasy, and I was getting that \"someone or something is watching me feeling\" a lot. I also saw something at the corner of my eye 3 times, but whenever I looked, it would vanish. After the third time, I noticed Lizzy, my friend, and Jon, my boyfriend, having similar uneasy expressions. Looking to the side a lot as well. I whispered in Jon's ear \"Do you keep seeing that too?\" \"Yeah.\" He replied. I then whispered in Lizzy's ear, she said the same. We where having fun and didn't want to spoil the fun, so we just decided it must have been a kid hiding behind a tree, waiting to jump out and say \"boo\" to a friend. Still, we couldn't wipe away how uneasy we felt. Now, I read stories on reddit without an account about paranormal or weird crap happening to people...I always see variations of the quote \"chill down my spine\" and have never really experienced that. Something about that \"kid\" felt wrong. I felt that chilling feel over and over again. We decided to head over to Orion when I heard something that scared me so much I thought my eyeballs where going to fall out of my skull, and I gagged on my own tongue. \\*SNAP!\\* I swear, something was behind us and stepped on something that broke. We all looked behind us and lying behind us was a light up sword that was snapped in half. Jon tried to reassure me and Lizzy by saying \"This is a popular park, a visitor stepped on it.\" But that was just the problem...This park is normally full of people, in fact, *seconds* ago it was. I *never* cuss but, my god, it was *too fucking* quiet. The only sound we heard was the wind, rocking the swings on the swing ride back and forth, making the overused metal squeak. We just kept moving, thinking nothing of it, but my god, who could have broke that toy? Nobody was there! And the path is a straight shot, there was *no way* someone could have broken it without us seeing. We got in line for Orion, and although the line for that one is usually long, it was very short this time, Jon, being the bro that he is, kept trying to keep our mind off the whole thing. \"We got lucky with our timing, huh?\" He said. I wanted to get my mind off it too, so I let out a pathetic little giggle. We got on the ride, second row from front. The rest of our friends filled 4 other rows. The announcer turned on her microphone and said \"Here you go up and away on Orion. Enjoy your ride and the rest of your day at Kiiiings Island!\" and the ride began. We where at the very top of the hill when Jon violently shook me and pointed at the woods, where we saw trees moving in a path, like something was jumping from tree to tree. It was actually terrifying. We went down the hill, and as we where going hundreds of miles per hour, I SWEAR I could make out a small inhuman face looking at us as we rode the coaster. When we got off, we heard something that sounded like a human scream, but it wasn't a human scream. It sounded *almost* human, but it sounded more like it could be an animal. About 4 hours later, the sun was going down. My friends Amy and Kyle offered to buy us some of the famous Kings Island ice cream. It was an offer we couldn't refuse. And after a few more rides, it was time for the firework show before the closing. So you can get an idea where we where, we where just coming off of Diamondback when the rest of our friends wanted to ride Mystic Timbers before it closes, because of the lack of a line. Jon and Izzy felt bad leaving me alone after we got spooked, and we still couldn't wipe that \"something's watching\" vibe. Once again, when we where nearby Action Zone, it got too quiet again, and we saw something we will never forget. It was crawling on all fours, It had eyes that glowed yellow, it's skin was green, and it had scales all over it's body. It started standing up on it's legs, and it was *huge.* it was TALL! At least 7'5, and the thing *spoke.* The thing screeched and said something under it's breath, none of us could make out any words other than \"harm,\" \"run,\" and \"feed.\" It ran into the woods after that. We didn't get any sleep, and since then, we haven't told anyone about it. It was today when I saw a number of people claiming to see a yellow-eyed creature all throughout Mason and Cincinatti Ohio that I knew it was time to make a Reddit account, and share the story. If anyone has seen this creature, do tell. Thank you for hearing me out. If you know what this thing is, tell me. Until then, goodbye.",

        "text": "**Part 1**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Three months. That's how much you have left.\"\n\n\"...What if I try the new chemotherapy you mentioned earlier?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid it won't be that effective. It has already spread to the lungs, so chemo is no longer an option.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCancer. In my pancreas, and now to my lungs. Oh lord, I muttered. I've been cursing at those chemos that looked like pure filth until just a few weeks ago, and here I am now, begging for another trial. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"But we could at least give it a try and see how it goes, can't we? It surely must help in *some* way.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTrue. Disgusting as it may be, that thing had been keeping me alive for quite some time. But maybe not anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Your body,\" the doctor started carefully, \"has reached its limit. It can no longer take in those powerful drugs. If you want the chemo so badly that you're willing to take risks, I won't stop you. But it would be safer if you didn't.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYeah, a safer way toward death, I thought.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Mr.Rider? It's time for your meal. May I help you to your ward?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA nurse had entered the room without me noticing her. Startled by her voice, I spun around and saw a tall, fit woman with blond hair and heavy makeup. She was hard to be unnoticed. Could it be that those bloody cancer cells were finally starting to sap the strength out of my senses, eating away my body?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I'm fine. I can help myself.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI dragged my feet towards the door, closed it, and shuffled to my ward. Within my blurry vision, I saw one of my gowns lying on the floor. I bent down for it and found a rusty name tag under the bed that read: Ken Rider, 32 years old. It was almost a year old. My new name tag read: Ken Rider, 33 years old.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Thirty-three,\" I read out loud. What a young age to die. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSkipping dinner, I cuddled into the blanket and closed my eyes for what would be my last night here in this hospital. I'm leaving this ward tomorrow, I told myself. If, of course, I can make it through this night alive. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe very cause of my cancer, I can say with certainty, is because of the horrible bullying I had to suffer during middle school. There were six of them - six that I can remember, at least - who were lucky enough to find a nice human toy on which they could fully express their growing sense of teenage violence. The damage they have done to me in physical terms is one thing; my real trauma was getting mentally devastated. They would beat me almost every day until my nose cracked and my teeth fell out, and even then they couldn't be more excited to think of another way for me to compensate for the loss of their entertainment. I've tried my best to fight them, but to no avail. The only result of my desperate struggle against them was the dreadful feeling of impotence and isolation, and that terrible sensation strangled me all throughout my lifetime, leaving lethal scars every day and every night. It is those scars that had turned into cancer which has now grown too big and too deadly for me to deal with. Alex. Kevin. The two names I remember until now. The two names most responsible for my current state.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Please, Alex. This is insane. I can't do this, I'm sorry.\"\n\nSlap. My left cheek which had been already bruised started swelling up, making it hard for me to see.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Do not test my patience and do it, for the sake of everyone to cared enough to come all the way here to watch your show.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe entire crowd was giggling, some even filming me with their phones, and none of them seemed to be willing to stop this horrific show until I finished the mission. Beside my trembling right foot lay Coco, my beloved cat. She was more than just a family. She was a soulmate. There was no way I could do it. No way I could hack her to death. I dropped the knife I had been holding and hugged Coco.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I'll do anything else you tell me to do,\" I whimpered, \"but not this. How can I - \"\n\nAt that moment, I heard something crack inside my head. Then the world began to spin around me. As my legs went limp I hit the ground head first with a heavy thud, then my shoulders, and fell unconscious. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhether it was the bitter taste of blood inside my mouth or the hissing of Coco that woke me up, I cannot remember, but the first thing I saw after opening my eyes was the horrific scene of Coco being bound with a rope. Alex was working on her hind legs, binding the ropes so hard that her paws had already turned purple. Behind him was Alex's best friend, Kevin, holding a bucket of red paint. He was laughing in a way that seemed to be spooking Coco off, shaking his head left and right every few seconds. Then he fixed his eyes upon her, gestured Alex to get out of the way, and splashed the paint all over her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Well well... now she needs some grooming, doesn't she?\" Kevin giggled.\n\n\"Looks like we have the perfect tool for that!\" Alex replied, already excited to see how I would react. He picked up the knife I had dropped and marched forward.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy heart sank, and I cried out, \"Stop!!! Please, Please Alex! I'll do anything, everything you want!! I swear!!!\"\n\nBut they didn't seem to hear me. I had to yell harder. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Please leave her alone, you've got *me!!!* She has nothing to do with you!! SOMEBODY STOP HIM!!!\"\n\nWith Coco's horrible screeching, I flew out of bed and smashed my forehead against the window on the left. That's when I had it clear. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n'I've got to kill them. Alex especially, that son of a bitch who ruined my entire life just for fun. That's the one thing I must finish before I die.'\n\nPanting and sweating, I stormed out of the ward and splashed my face with cold water. \n\n'I don't have much time, and I can't do this alone. I'll have to look for a partner.'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThinking of a partner, I was reminded of a classmate named Jack who had also been bullied heavily by Alex and his friends. Although not best friends, Jack and I were still good friends. A friend close enough to share our hurtful feelings toward them. Yes, Jack. He is the one. He could be the ideal one for this job. The perfect partner to help me out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Part 2**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the first time after being diagnosed with cancer, I found myself a clear goal, a goal that gave me endless energy and spirit. I commissioned a famous detective agency to figure out the tiniest details about Alex's life, and after about a month I had my plans roughly set up. My best chance would be hiding near his workplace and knocking him out with a taser on his way home, but there was a problem. Alex was working for a mayor in the countryside as his private secretary, which meant I had to keep a close eye on the mayor somehow as well. If his secretary went missing for even a short while, that would mean trouble. Severe trouble. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Which is where Jack kicks in,\" I mumbled. Jack was the leader of a management team working for the country's biggest shipping company, and according to the news, there seemed to be an upcoming conference regarding the problems of illegal shipping that all mayors had to attend. If Jack could figure out when and where the conference would be held, things could be much easier. The mayor would be too busy to care even if Alex went missing. So I decided to meet Jack in front of his house and ask for what I needed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter waiting about an hour on the bench in front of Jack's garden, I saw his car emerge and waved my right hand. In my other hand were reports from the detective agency about Alex and a medicine packet including some morphine painkillers. I had to sell him that I was in desperate need of his help. Jack got out of the car and headed towards me with unexpected company. A wife. \n\n'Gee,' I thought. 'I didn't know he was married.'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShivering in the cold weather with his hand tightly holding his wife's, Jack presented an awkward smile to greet me. He had this weird way of talking with a vague expression of reluctance since middle school, which was one of the things Alex would always prey on for excuse. An excuse to beat him up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Hey.. it's been quite a while... since we met. You've never met Sarah before, have you..?\" \n\nI shook my head, hiding what I brought behind my back. I couldn't show this in front of his wife.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Honey, who is he? Is he a friend of yours? Or a colleague, maybe?\" the wife asked.\n\n\"Um... haven't I told you about him either..? Haha..... seems like I haven't. Well, it's never too late to start knowing each other. Greetings.\" Jack replied, this time his face trembling heavily as well. Sarah shook my hands, laughed shortly about how Jack was always having trouble when it came to dealing with people, and went inside, leaving Jack by my side. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"So.. what is it...?\" Jack asked nervously.\n\nI looked at him for a while, took a deep breath, and started explaining. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy the time I was finished, Jack was dumbstruck. His vision was fixed on the ground and I could see his head spinning, scouring madly for any possible flaws that I might have missed while setting up my plan. When he finally decided to speak, his voice was so tiny I had to lean over right next to him to hear his words properly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Look, I.. I have a family. Sarah is going to become a mother soon.. and I don't want to ruin their lives for the sake of my personal revenge. I'm sorry... really sorry.. that I can't help you with this..\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI sighed. Not a sigh of disappointment, but a sigh of utter disbelief. How could it be possible that Jack and I, raised and taught in the same environment during our entire teenagehood, have become such different adults just after about a decade? And apart from that, how on earth was Jack finding it okay to let go of the perfect chance of revenge against the bastard who had wrecked his entire school life? Didn't he have the slightest feeling of anger or rage inside of him? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Jack,\" I spoke flatly, \"the way you speak and the way you smile, that weird expression of yours, isn't that your terrible aftermath of getting bullied? And your right leg too. You can't walk properly even until now after they broke your knees. Do you not see that they have damaged our lives permanently, yours physically and mine mentally?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSilence fell. Jack's shoulders were trembling - in fact, his whole body had been trembling this entire time during my visit - and I could see him restart the tug of war inside his mind, hopefully, this time leading to a better conclusion. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Well.. there is one thing... just one thing I can do to help you out. I know the details... about the conference schedule.. you know, for the shipping. It's this Saturday afternoon... it starts at 3 PM and ends at... at like 8 PM or something. I'll double-check.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI looked at him, my eyes widening. This guy was finally getting the gist of what I was talking about.\n\n\"And where is it held?\" I asked. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"In a city far away from Alex's hometown,\" Jack replied. In his voice flew a scent of seriousness I had never felt before, which gave credibility.\n\n\"Where exactly? Do you know the location?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure, but you don't have to worry about that. The conference is highly confidential, so Alex will probably be left out the entire day, which means he's likely to have a day off. Away from his mayor, you see... for quite some time.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow that, I remarked, is a precious piece of information. Not as critical as I had hoped, but still worth taking in. 3 PM to 8 PM, Saturday, far away from hometown. 3 PM, 8 PM, Saturday, far away from hometown. I scribbled the words inside my head to make sure they didn't slip away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Alright, thanks. That's very helpful.\"\n\n\"One last thing. Ken, promise me something when you meet Alex. Finish him off in the most painful way, will you? Do it instead of me... and for yourself as well.\"\n\nI grinned and replied, \"You can count on me.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was about to turn around and leave when I figured that Jack's face was extremely pale, much paler than usual, and his eyes were glittering with resentment big enough to swallow him whole. But not near enough to swallow his entire family, which was why he couldn't be as proactive as he should have been for his revenge. What a pity, I thought, to be able to vent only in the least pleasurable way.\n\nSo without really meaning it, I added, \"Oh, and Jack, I'll make sure to call you when I bring Alex into my garage.. so that you can join me anytime you want. Just in case you change your mind.\"\n\nJack grinned his awkward smile, waved his hands, and closed the door. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Part 3**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnly two days were left until the conference, and my body was getting worse every day. But my mind, my living soul, had never been stronger. As I got out of bed, I tasted blood inside my throat, which I was starting to get used to since I'd been coughing out blood every now and then for the past week or so. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n'I cannot die, not like this. I have things to finish.'\n\nI hauled myself out of the bedroom and turned the TV on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*&lt;Soldiers in the Pacific are now entering their training season, but will they manage to...&gt;*\n\nHmm. What a boring issue. I lay down on the sofa and switched to the next channel. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*&lt;The battle to avoid relegation, will it succeed? The fans haven't been supportive of...&gt;*\n\nAnd next.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*&lt;Breaking News: A mayor found lying unconscious in the hospital due to a severe car accident...&gt;*\n\nI sat straight up. A mayor? Fallen unconscious? Could it be *the* mayor? \n\nMy phone rang. It was a call from Jack, and I picked it up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Did you hear the News?\"\n\n\"You mean, about the mayor?\"\n\n\"Yup, seems like you should be in a hurry.\"\n\nOh, great. So it *was* the mayor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJack continued, \"They say he was rushed to the hospital, but I'm not sure about Alex. Just a heads up.\"\n\nI scanned the screen for one final check before heading to my car. \n\n*&lt;......and the doctor rated his chances of recovery as nil.&gt;*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy heart started beating madly. There was good news and bad news about this incident. The good news was that Alex going missing was no longer a problem since the mayor wouldn't be able to check it anyway. The bad news was that Alex, now a free man, could stray anywhere. If he decided to step out of his daily routine, which was, considering his tendency as the ultimate seeker for entertainment, highly probable, it would be difficult for me to find him. Starting the car, I prayed for him to be still asleep.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I reached Alex's house, the first sight of it gave me chills. I had received dozens of photos and reports about the area from the detective agency, but I never imagined it to be so eerily quiet. Apart from the old house in front of the car, this place was almost like a forest. There was absolutely no sign, no trace of any living creature around. Complete silence. That was the only way to describe it. Was Alex inside? If so, what could he be doing? Could he have already gone, far away from his house? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly I heard a terrifying sound right next to me: a knock-knock at my car window. I froze. There stood Alex, tilting his face sideways, trying to look into the car. I could recognize him straight away. His face had barely changed since middle school, but he had grown taller and was wearing a suit, probably an outfit for something official. But I didn't feel his approach. Just like I did with the nurse a month ago. Only this time, it was much more critical. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Excuse me, driving here is forbidden. How may I help you?\" He yelled through the window. Luckily, he didn't recognize me, thanks to the window's heavy tanning. I slowly picked up the taser I had brought with me and lowered the car window. My heart was thumping faster than ever. I could feel every beat, every movement of it inside my chest. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Can you hold this for a second?\" I asked, my voice shaking terribly. My body was starting to lose control. Even before facing him properly, I had already given in to the old fear of the past. Breathe, I told myself. Breathe. All you have to do is just time it right. Then he'll be on the ground. Just time it right. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Sure. Hand it over and I'll keep - \"\n\nAs soon as the window was open wide enough for a shot, I twisted my body to reveal the taser and fired it straight at Alex's chest. With a short shriek, he collapsed forward and bashed his head against the door before crippling down on the ground. He lay there, twitching. His eyes were still open, but the empty look on his face told me that he was knocked out for good. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI let out a deep sigh of victory. At least the difficult part was over now. I quickly texted Jack to come to my garage anytime he felt like doing so. Then I hauled his limp body into the back seat of my car and started to tie his arms and legs behind his back. When it was all done, I felt an enormous amount of adrenalin pumping all over my body. My heart was still beating heavily. This entire scene felt like a dream. Here lay Alex, tied up and unconscious underneath my knees, completely vulnerable. If I wanted to, I could kill him right now - I had brought a hammer and a knife with me as well in case things went wrong -  but it wasn't a wise decision to do it here. Plus, there was that promise I had made with Jack. I hurried over to the driver's seat and closed the door. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n'Don't be stupid and keep patient,' a voice rang inside my head.\n\n'You can't kill him just like that. He deserves more.'\n\nSo in I drove back to the foresty road. After a few minutes of driving, I began to feel dizzy. Or was I just feeling tired and sleepy? This entire hunt for Alex today had been well beyond my body's limit, and all my power was starting to drain out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n'Keep going!' The voice warned. Clutching onto the steering wheel, I forced myself to stay awake and rumbled toward my house. To my garage. To the place where Alex would finally expiate his sins. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Part 4**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Wake up, bitch.\"\n\nI splashed cold water into Alex's face, but he didn't budge. His limbs were tied to the chair he was sitting on, and I stood in front of him, waiting for him to come back to his senses. I slapped him. This time, his eyes flickered a bit. So I slapped him some more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"...What the heck..... where is this place..?\" he moaned. \n\n\"Ah, good. You're awake now. I was worried you might have been dead already.\" I replied.\n\nI stared at him and examined his face. In there was an emotion of both terror and anger. The same emotions I used to feel every day when Alex and Kevin were around. \n\n\"Look at me. Depending on what you say, I might let you live.\"\n\nHe stared back at me blankly for a few seconds and then nodded.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Why was it me? What was it that you hated so much about me?\"\n\nI looked straight at him with glaring eyes, trying hard to control the rage exploding inside. \n\n'Let's at least give him a chance to apologize. I can punish him after listening to what he has to say.'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter staring at each other for a while, Alex spoke.\n\n\"I'm sorry... I can't remember you. Who are you...? Did I do anything wrong to you? Is that why I'm here?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI stood there, stupified, unable to believe what I had just heard. He had to be joking. Nightmares of him had been haunting me all this time, and I had been suffering terrible traumas for almost twenty years. I have failed numerous job interviews due to that traumatic experience and now have fallen ill with terminal cancer. After all that, it was crazy for that bitch to say, \"Oh well, I don't remember you, but I'll apologize if I have caused any trouble.\" and then get away with it. How on earth could he not remember me? Was he playing dumb, acting as if he couldn't recognize me?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI took a step toward him and slammed his right hand as hard as I could with the hammer I had been holding. \n\n\"AAAAAGGGHH..!!!\" He cried out. I slammed the same spot again. This time, he shook his head up and down, writhing in agony. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Does it hurt??? Huh? DOES IT FUCKING HURT?!\" I yelled back. The third blow was on his head. I swung the hammer toward one of his temples, but the shaking of his head mistimed my blow and I felt the skull crack underneath the impact. Blood splattered everywhere, covering half of his head in seconds. \n\nHe started yelling, \"Who *are* you? What do you want from me?! When you're torturing me, you tell me who you are!!!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I'll tell you who I am,\" I replied, \"after this one.\" I marched again, this time for his knees. For the same knee bone that Jack had received a beating and got splintered. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I, I remember you!! It all just suddenly popped into my head, and I'm really sorry about it! I shouldn't have done that.. I must have been out of my mind. I apologize...\" \n\nAlex started sobbing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWithdrawing my hammer, I asked, \"Do you indeed? Can you remember who I am?\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe took a few seconds to breathe, and then came the reply.\n\n\"Yes, of course, Samuel. How could I forget? I've always wanted to apologize to my peers at uni. I admit that I was a psychopath back then. I mean it.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe slightest hope that he might recognize me and apologize was what had been keeping me from killing him straight away. That hope, thinner than a thread, broke miserably. I bent down, picked up a piece of thick nail on the ground, and dug it deep inside his left thigh with the hammer. He screeched painfully. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Listen. My name is Ken, not Samuel. And we met at middle school.\" I whispered. From then on, I cannot remember. For at least five minutes - or was it ten? - I must have gone crazy, pounding and stabbing him madly. At last, when I was too tired to move, I slouched on his body and the broken chair. Breathing heavily, I stared at his face, smeared all over with blood and dirt. The gush of dark blood that had been pouring out of his nose had begun to stop, leaving a red trace alongside his swollen chin, like a zombie in horror movies. So that's what I must have looked like during high school. What a disastrous scene. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow that Alex was dead, other things I had to consider started slipping into my mind. When would his friends or the mayor's workers come searching for him? Were they already on their way? I had to get up and clean the mess on the ground before the blood left permanent stains, but I could barely lift my arms. I lay down for some rest and wiped off the blood on my face. What a day, I thought. What an absolutely tiring, devastating day. My eyelids were too heavy to keep my eyes open, but I knew that closing them now would drag me to sleep forever. So I just lay there gazing at the ceiling.. and trying my best not to fall asleep.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Part 5**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was all over now. All over in a matter of minutes. But something just didn't feel right. Wasn't revenge supposed to get rid of the burden inside? I felt far from being settled. I felt some kind of horrible emptiness, even after a rather successful revenge. Was it because I had lost my mind throughout and couldn't remember most of it? A possible theory, but there was something else, a cause fundamentally different responsible for this uneasy feeling. What was it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was trying to figure out what exactly it was when I heard the roaring of a vehicle right outside my garage. The cops? No, they have sirens. And it couldn't be any of Alex's peers at work as well, since he worked alone. Which left only one person. I stood up and saw a truck enter. It didn't slow down until it stopped right in front of Alex's dead body. When the truck came into close view, I could see that its entire front was a complete mess. There were huge dents everywhere, the side mirror on the left was broken, and the door hinge had been torn apart. What a hurry he must have been in to come here. In the driver's seat was the familiar silhouette of Jack, and I adjusted my orientation toward him with a grin.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Hey, I didn't think you would come.\"\n\nHe walked out of the truck and I greeted him by handing him over a knife lying next to the corpse. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"You arrived a bit too late, I'm afraid. He's already dead. If you're still okay with a dead Alex though, then go ahead and do whatever you want. He's all yours. It's a priceless chance for you to overcome your trauma.\"\n\nJack took the knife and rubbed its blade against a brown shawl he had draped around his shoulders which seemed to be made of animal fur. There was a writing carved into it: *R.I.P, My Dear Bella.* Whatever that meant, he must have worn it for a reason, probably something related to his trauma during his school years. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"You're right. I thought about what you told me earlier, about revenge, and realized this was something I had to finish with my own hands.\" After taking a quick scan around the garage, Jack asked quietly, \"What did Alex say to you before dying?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Oh, that bitch,\" I replied heavily, \"didn't even remember me. After all that bullying, he couldn't find a clue of who I was. What a comedy. I spent my entire life petrified, but to him, it had been literally nothing more than a joke. This is so fucking unfair.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJack looked up into my eyes. He was holding the knife in one hand, and his shawl in the other. Both hands were trembling. He was hesitating. That's when I noticed he was wearing a cast around his neck. He had been covering the area with the shawl. Did he crash his truck while hurrying over? Or was he involved in some kind of accident? Wait, a truck? A group of letters suddenly flashed through my head. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*&lt;...and according to the police, the truck driver had run away after striking the mayor with a vehicle much heavier than his...&gt;*\n\nThe Mayor. The truck. The accident. My brain started spinning. Was it the same truck? I turned around swiftly to check if the truck was the one that had appeared on TV when I suddenly felt a searing sensation on my waist. It started to burn immediately. The pain was so excruciating that I couldn't even breathe. When I turned my head to check, I saw a knife stuck into my waist. It was the knife I had handed over to Jack. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What the..?\"\n\nI collapsed to the floor, my shirt starting to soak with blood. I gagged for breath and tried desperately to get up again, but my body didn't listen. My legs were heavy as a log. I looked up and saw Jack limping toward me, this time holding a hammer in his hand. I had to get up somehow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"It is you,\" Jack sobbed, \"who ruined my life. I've had more traumas because of what *you* did to me than Alex or his friends. You vented your anger on me every time they troubled you, and that memory has given me horrible nightmares.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWHAT? I staggered to my feet with my back hunched over the knife stuck in my stomach, already feeling dizzy. What the hell was he talking about? For a moment, I thought I might be dreaming. But the pain in my stomach was too real for it to be a dream. Jack unfolded his shawl and spread it wide in front of me, showing me the words I had seen earlier. He then asked, \"Do you remember Bella?\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I.. I don't get it. What are you talking about? Who is Bella? Look, there must have been some kind of misunderstanding - \"\n\nAnother horrible burn throbbed inside that contracted the muscles around the area, cutting off my words. This one was ridiculously painful. For the first time, I felt what it was like to die. Before I knew it, Jack was right in front of me. He whispered, \"Bella was my dog. And you killed her.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy heart started racing. Bella? His dog? Since when did Jack have a dog in his family? I felt Jack's fingers close around my neck. Then he growled in a low voice with his eyes almost popping out of rage, *\"You don't remember either, do you? You punk.\"* And that's the last thing I heard from him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"It's not fair they didn't do the same to Bella, is it? I thought we were friends in the same boat.\"\n\n\"Ken, please..\"\n\n\"Looks like she needs some grooming too. Don't worry. I won't use the paint. We're friends after all, aren't we? Come here, Bella. It's time for you to meet Coco.\"",

        "text": "I was in the middle of a routine patrol of the park when my radio crackled to life. The frequency didn’t indicate an emergency, so I pulled my truck over to the side of the road and called in to base. On the other end of the radio was Emmett, a fellow park ranger and one of my favorite coworkers. \n\n“What’s up Emmett?” I asked. \n\n“Not much Aiden. Just got someone here who wants to know if we’ve seen her missing brother.” \n\n“Have we?” \n\n“Doesn’t look familiar to me, but since you’re due for lunch about now, why don’t you head back?” \n\n“Sounds good to me.” \n\nI put the radio down, shifted the truck into drive, and headed straight back to the ranger station. It was only a five-minute ride from my present location, and I rolled the windows down as I drove down the neatly paved roads that wound around numerous picnic areas, ponds, clusters of trees, fire pits, and pavilions complete with vending machines. \n\nIt didn’t take me much longer to arrive at the station, a large wooden compound with an office, numerous vehicles parked in front, and an exterior that had been freshly painted last month. I noticed that there was a grey sedan that stood out in the sea of trucks, jeeps, and golf carts for official usage. \n\nThere was a spot right next to it available, so I parked there and headed inside. No matter what the weather was, the ranger station was always perfectly climate and temperature controlled. Right inside the front door, there was a sitting room filled with comfortable furniture. In two of the chairs sat Emmett and a young woman who looked close to us in age. She had curly brown hair, hazel eyes, and a slightly weary attitude that suggested she had visited many places like this. I also noticed the two of them had made good use of the nearby refrigerator that held bottled water. \n\nThey both stood up when I walked inside. I saw Emmett had some papers sitting on the table beside him. \n\n“Aiden, this is Lena,” Emmett introduced us.\n\nWe shook hands. “Nice to meet you,” I said. \n\n“Likewise. I’m just here to double check. I have no reason to be sure my brother even went this way, but I wouldn’t be doing my part if I didn’t ask around.” \n\nI nodded. “Of course. Why don’t you tell me what happened? That is, if you don’t mind telling it again.” \n\nShe chuckled. “I’ve told it so many times it’s second nature,” she said while sitting back down in her chair. “Sadly there’s not much to tell. My brother Sam has always been flighty. So when he disappeared for a few days, no one thought a thing about it. But when a few days turned into a few weeks, that’s when we started to get worried. But when we went to his last address, there was no sign anything happened. And since Sam was always bouncing around, it wasn’t exactly a clear-cut case of something being wrong. So there wasn’t much for anyone to go on. The only thing we were able to find out was that he was hanging out with a group of friends who were a lot like him within an hour of here. From all appearances, they were just a normal bunch of people.” \n\n“So you think since people just come and go here, it’s entirely possible they set up camp here at some point and left, or even better, are still here?” Emmett asked. \n\n“Exactly,” Lena said. “Sam always did like camping. He’s the type who would be perfectly happy always traveling the country in an RV.” \n\nI nodded.” Makes perfect sense why you think he might be here.” \n\nEmmet turned to the papers sitting near him on the coffee table. “This is him Aiden,” he said while he selected one and handed it to me. It was one of those missing person fliers that you put up anywhere, with the phrase MISSING printed on the top in bold red lettering. There was also the standard contact info, but most of the flier was taken up by a large photo of a blond man with wide hazel eyes. It took me a moment, but I could see the resemblance between Sam and Lena. \n\n“I’ve never seen him before around here. But that doesn’t mean he’s never been here.” \n\n“Sam’s a decent guy.” Lena explained. “Flighty, but he’s not an angry or mean type. He’d run from a fight instead of starting one.” \n\n“Is that what you think happened?” I asked. \n\n“I’ve certainly thought about it, but I just can’t see it. Like I said, he’d be perfectly happy traveling around in a basic RV. It’s far more likely he got into some accident, and no one can get ahold of him. Which is another possibility of what he could be doing out here.” \n\nEmmett took a sip of his bottled water. “I’ve double checked the log and we don’t have any record of any equipment or RV turning up here with no explanation. Apart from that, the most we could do is take another look around and ask the other park personnel to be on the lookout.” \n\n“I appreciate that very much,” Lena said. “My whole family would be very grateful if you kept an eye out and notified us or the police if you saw or heard anything.” \n\n“Will do Lena.” Emmett stood up from his seat. “Thank you for letting us know. We have your information, and we’ll let you know if we see or find anything.” \n\n“Thank you. You both have a good one.”\n\nShe stood up, shook hands with us, and walked out the door. Moments later, there was the sound of a car starting up before tires crunched over gravel and pulled away. \n\n“What do you think?” Emmett asked now that we were alone.\n\n“We’ve dealt with stuff like this before.” \n\n“I know. He wouldn’t be the first to go missing out here, and he wouldn’t be the last either.” \n\n“No doubt.” \n\nThen I took my time for lunch. Today, that meant I had a turkey wrap with some potato salad. Then I went back to work, taking time to keep an eye on the usual areas as I watched people walk their dogs, take hikes, or lounge about. \n\nIt was a sunny autumn day, with a bright blue sky that contrasted beautifully with the occasional orange and red leaves dotting the mostly green tree line. The temperature was warm and comfortable now, but this morning was chilly, and fog blanketed the horizon as I drove to work. It wouldn’t be long before both morning and night were much darker and colder. The change of seasons are always stark and captivating to see here in the woods. It wouldn’t be long before the days themselves grew darker and colder, and the park was decorated for Halloween. I never failed to be part of the team that decorated and prepared for that. \n\nSince it was fall, that meant dusk settled in quicker than it had just a few weeks earlier. Before I knew it, the shadows were creeping up on the park, which meant it was time for me to politely remind people the park closed at nighttime. The wind picked up by then, which meant the few leaves that had already fallen were being scattered around. \n\nThe last car had just pulled out of the lot when I locked the entrance for the general public. Then Emmett and I did the last of the closing shift checklist before we went out through the employee only gate and called it a night. \n\nI went home, had myself some dinner, and watched some TV before I called it a night. The next morning I had an early shift, but I didn’t mind since I was only working a half day. So after I grabbed myself a bagel, I drove to work. The sky was solid grey, with a hint of rain in the air. Which matched what I’d seen on the weather report. \n\nThe drive itself was unremarkable, so I arrived to the park in good time. But as I pulled up to the front gate, which was still locked up from the night before, I saw something. A single, solitary figure, standing just inside the front gate. \n\nWhat? How was that possible? We locked up the same as always, and we’d never had this issue before. Even weirder was the fact that the figure was facing away from the gate, as if watching something inside the park.\n\nI pulled off the driveway and called my boss Carlton and told him what was up. He said he’d be right there and told me to sit tight. He didn’t want me walking into an unpleasant surprise, and he didn’t need to tell me twice. So I waited there, never quite taking my eyes off the front gate. Which wasn’t hard, since whoever was lurking there didn’t move. In fact, I wasn’t even sure they were aware of my presence since they hadn’t reacted at all to the sound of my car. I also noticed they were dressed in clothes that looked faded and torn.\n\nAfter what felt like an eternity, Carlton arrived with a single cop car behind him. They parked ahead of me, and once he and the cop got out of their cars, I did the same. Then the three of us walked steadily towards the gate. It wasn’t until we were right on top of the stranger that I finally got a look at who it was. \n\nIt was Lena’s brother Sam. My stomach clenched at the realization, but Sam showed no interest at all in what was going on. He looked at us as nonchalantly as someone walking here on a hike might glance at a tree. \n\nI quickly explained the situation and called Lena. She said she’d be here as soon as she could, and emphatically thanked us. In the meantime, the cop called for backup and an ambulance before he carefully approached Sam and assessed him. The cop decided he was no harm, so Carlton helped escort Sam to the back of his squad car. The ambulance got there before Lena did, so they were still giving him an exam when she arrived. \n\nAfter giving me a bone crushing hug, Lena went over to where the medics were studying her brother. \n\n“He’s a bit dehydrated and hasn’t eaten a decent meal for a while, but apart from that, he seems unharmed.” One of the medics, a tall woman with red hair, told her. \n\n“But there’s no doubt he’s seen something or been through something that rattled him.” The other medic, an older man with a mustache said. “I’ve seen this type of reaction to major traumas before. And he’s got all the signs.” \n\n“Do you have any idea what caused it?” Lena asked. \n\nHe shook his head. “No, but I can tell you it was something that seriously frightened him.” \n\nShe nodded. “Alright. Thank you. I appreciate the insight.” \n\nWhile that was going on, enough additional park rangers had shown up so we could search the park with the cops close behind. I had no idea what we’d find, but I felt something was wrong from the moment we set foot inside. Every time I arrived here, I felt a sense of calm and peace that came from being in the thick of nature. The scent of pine trees, the warmth of campfires, and the sounds of all the different insects making their presence know. I always found it to be relaxing and invigorating. \n\nNot this time. Today, the mood in the park felt different. Off. Like you were looking at something and could tell some aspect had been changed, but you weren’t sure what. The air felt thick and heavy. I glanced at Carlton, and he looked at me, and I could tell he felt the same.\n\nOn the surface everything was fine, but that didn’t mean nothing happened. So we carefully set out to search every inch of the park to make sure nothing was wrong. Every time I turned a corner or opened a door, I expected to find something horrible. But it never happened. Everything turned out to be perfectly in order. Not a thing was out of place. But we couldn’t figure out how Sam had gotten in. How had he done it? \n\nEventually, we had to shrug and admit we couldn’t find anything. That was when the search party called it a day and those of us that were left went to the ranger station for some water. Sam had been taken to the hospital by Lena and her parents, and we’d put up a sign saying the park was temporarily closed, so it was just us. \n\n“Something is going on here.” Emmett said after he took a long drink of water. “I just don’t know what.” \n\n“I know. But he got in somehow. You saw the state he was in. There was no way Sam forced his way in.” \n\n“I agree Aiden,” Carlton said, “I just don’t like this.” \n\nI looked around the room. “None of us do.” \n\nEmmett was about to say something else before he stood up and looked around. Then he slowly began to walk around the room. \n\n“Emmett?” I asked. \n\nHe briefly looked at the window before he turned to face me. “Do you feel that?” \n\n“Feel what?” \n\n“The breeze. There’s a draft in here.” \n\n“Yeah. I feel it too.” One of the cops nodded his head. “I think it’s coming from over there.” He pointed to a large file cabinet against the wall. \n\nAll six of us walked over to it and waited. It didn’t take long for me to feel a small breeze coming from around it. \n\nWe all exchanged a look before Emmett and Carlton slowly maneuvered the metal cabinet away from the wall. Everyone else stood at the ready should something happen. But nothing popped out. All that happened was that the air got colder, and a section of floor opened into a hole in the ground. \n\nTwo of the cops immediately took out their flashlights and shined them into the hole. The rest of us peered behind them, and saw the hole opened up into a small cave. The flashlights revealed that the cave floor was only about a short drop from the opening. There was no ladder or anything, but it didn’t look hard to maneuver.\n\nThe opening was large enough for a single person to fit through at a time, so Emmett, Carlton, and I went down with the two cops with flashlights. They went in first, then Emmett, Carlton, and I did. The cave was uncluttered by any debris, and there was no water, so there wasn’t much to look at. \n\nNot that the cave itself took much time to explore either, because before we knew it, we were facing the other end of the cave that turned into a dead end. The two cops shined their flashlights around, but there was nothing to see. \n\nWe all had a last look around before we headed back the way we came. I had no idea what to think. My mind was a jumbled haze of thoughts as we reached where the opening was, and I stopped dead in my tracks. Because of the angle of where the opening was and how the cave was laid out, there was a wall set back a few feet from the opening, and there was something written on the wall that wasn’t visible from above. \n\n*We see you!* \n\nIt was written in red paint with giant letters that could not be missed or misread. The exclamation point in particular was drawn with particular embellishment, as if whoever had done it had enjoyed it immensely. We all looked at it in shock before one of the cops took a picture of it. \n\nThen he turned to the rest of us. “No need to linger down here any longer.” \n\nCarlton immediately pointed to Emmett and myself, so Emmett helped me up to the opening, and once I was back inside the ranger station, I helped him out. Once we helped Carlton out, the two cops quickly maneuvered themselves out before we moved the file cabinet back over the cave opening. \n\nThen we all sat back down in silence. The air was tense and heavy, and I felt a faint prickle of fear on the back of my neck. I didn’t know what was going on, but I didn’t like whatever it was. And neither did anyone else. We would have noticed that cave opening before. Especially with all the recent maintenance work.\n\n“Ok.” The cop who took the picture turned to Carlton. He was tall, lean, and had closely cropped blond hair. “Something is going on here, and until we get to the bottom of it, I suggest you close up shop for today.” \n\n“Fine by me,” Carlton muttered. “Let’s get out of here.” \n\nWe hustled out of there before Carlton locked it up tight. Then we all got in our respective vehicles and pulled out after locking up the gate tight. As a precaution, they agreed to have a cop car parked there for the night. \n\nI wasted no time in heading for home. But when we all drove away, I swear I thought I saw what looked like a figure in black clothing peering at us from behind a massive tree. When I looked back, there was nothing there. \n\nIt could’ve been a prank, or it could’ve been just my imagination. Either way, I wasn’t going back there to find out. Because I couldn’t stop thinking about the message on the wall. We see you, as in more than one person is watching you. \n\nThe cops never did find out what was going on, or how Sam had gotten in. But sometimes when I was out on patrols after that, I would swear someone was watching me. I could feel the hair stand up on the back of my neck, and I would get that stomach churning certainty that something was off, but every time I turned around, nothing was ever there. One time, late at night, I even thought I saw someone following me, but when I went to check, no one was there. \n\nBut no matter what, I never stopped checking that nothing was there. No one did. Because periodically, we would find something had been moved or altered in some way. Sometimes it was barely noticeable, but that didn’t mean we didn’t notice. We also had the opening to the cave boarded up. But I can’t help but wonder if there are more tunnels just like that elsewhere in the park.",

        "text": "[Pt. 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10szh17/theres_something_in_the_subway_tunnels/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*“Tonight is the night I’ll make history. After this nothing will ever be the same”.*\n\nI lay awake in the darkness. The sound of crickets is the only thing I can hear right now. Where the fuck am I? \n\nA tent?\n\nI hear footsteps crunching in the leaves. I try to get up to turn the light off but I can’t move. I hear the sound of a maniacal laugh in the distance. It echoes through the night and in my mind. Then suddenly I see a moonlit silhouette approach the tent. Move, move. I can’t move at all. \n\nThe tent is slowly unzipped as I hear the laugh get louder and louder. It is so loud my ears start ringing in pain. Then a skinny figure grabs my neck and starts choking me. It’s a tall, skinny gray figure with a blank face. \n\nThe sweat makes my grip weak. I can’t breathe. The laughing gets so loud I just hear the ringing. I can’t fight back. Suddenly I black out. Just the sound of ringing in my ear. \n\nThen I’m in my bed. I’m soaked in sweat but I can breathe and my ears aren’t ringing. Must have been a nightmare. It was the third one this week. I looked at the clock and it read 5:03. I needed to get ready soon. I got out of the bed with the image of the face of the man from the tape still on my mind. \n\nI walked into the bathroom and splashed water on my face. This needed to end. I couldn't take it. Maybe if I figured out what happened then I could put this all behind me. This couldn't possibly end well, but no time to think about it now, I needed to go to the job now. At least this time I won’t be alone. I’ll be with another worker, Bradley. \n\nI had met him once or twice but never talked to him for more than a few seconds. If I could have him see this then maybe we could confront the boss about this. I couldn't really call the police because there was really nothing I could prove. It was so dark there the blood stains might have been dirt or mud and unless they saw what I saw, then they couldn't do much. \n\nI got dressed and skipped breakfast. I ran outside and got in my car. It was cold this morning and I could see my own breath. I hopped in my car and raced down to the location. \n\nBy the time I got to the station it was already 5:45. I saw Bradley waiting on the outside. He had driven the van there with the tools and the pipe in the back. I pulled up and got out of the car. \n\n“Ready to start?” He said as he got out of the car. \n\n“Yep.” I replied. \n\nHe immediately started explaining the plan.\n\n“We have the pipe in the back and the tools as well. We’ll bring the pipe down first. I assume you marked off the point where it needed to be fixed?” \n\n“Yes, I marked it down on the clipboard and I have the coordinates in the tunnel.” I responded.\n\nI reached in my bag and took out the clipboard. It showed the coordinates. \n\n“Well if you're ready we can start and hopefully finish this as soon as possible,” he said. \n\n“Alright, sounds good.” I replied. \n\nHe walked up to the back of the van and opened it up. There was a large pipe laying on the floor in the back. \n\n“Hey, open the door and I’ll take the pipe out,” he said, “After you’ve got the door open, grab the tools and help me take this pipe down the stairs.” \n\n“Alright.” I replied.\n\nI walked up to the door and took out my key and unlocked it. I opened the door and it made a massive scrap as it opened and echoed. I looked down into the darkness remembering my events from the previous week. \n\n“Hey you got that open?” He yelled over. \n\n“Yep.” I replied.\n\n“Grab the tools.” He said to me. \n\nI walked over to the van and picked up the heavy leather pouch with the tools in it. I strapped it to my belt. He started walking over to the door and I lifted the other end of the pipe to help him carry it down the stairs. \n\n“Watch your step.” He reminded me. \n\nWe slowly moved down the stairs. The door’s would be left open this time because neither of us could close the door because we were carrying the pipe. All the horrors slowly started coming back to me as I remembered what had happened the previous time. \n\nWe slowly descended the stairs. I felt the wetness of the floor get inside my boot. As we approached the bottom the light at the top door was getting smaller and less bright. \n\nWe finally got to the bottom. The light at the door was almost completely gone. We slowly moved down the path. The sound of our footsteps echoed through the ambient tunnels.\n\n“Just down here.” I told him. \n\nWe finally made it to the section where the pipe was. I was already sweating and I felt that if I turned around there would be someone or something there. Bradley wasn’t that big of a guy so it’s not like he would be able to fight anything off. \n\nAfter some time had passed we quickly fixed the pipe. Just for maybe a split second I was not scared. I had nothing to fear. I would leave this place and leave the darkness behind me. \n\n“Alright, the pipe looks good. We just need to get maintenance to turn the water back on and see if anything leaks on the side.” Bradley told me. \n\nHe grabbed his walkie talkie.\n\n“Hello, just hoping we can run a quick test for the pipe.” He waited for a response. \n\nThen suddenly there was a voice over the walkie talkie. \n\n“I got a guy there right now, he’ll turn the water on.” \n\n“Alright, we just have to wait now.” Bradley said to me. \n\nAfter a few seconds of waiting the voice came back over the walkie talkie. \n\n“It’s on. Is everything good?” \n\nHe waited a second. \n\n“Everything’s good. We’re coming back up now.” Bradley responded over the walkie talkie. \n\n“Good to go?” I asked him. \n\n“Let’s go,” He said, “Just help me carry the old pipe back up to the van.”\n\nWe picked it up and started carrying it to the stairs. Then suddenly I heard a sound that took me back to the feared state I was in a few days ago. It was a footstep. The same moist footstep on the wet dirt echoed through the tunnel. \n\n“What the fuck?” Bradley said, “You hear that?”\n\n“Yeah.” I responded. \n\n“Probably just a rat or something.” He said. \n\nWe quickly walked toward the stairs and suddenly I heard something that I haven’t heard since my nightmares. It was the faint sound of laughter. It was almost identical to the video. \n\n“What the fuck?” \n\nBradley sounded more worried this time. \n\n“Put this down for a second.” He said. \n\nWe set it on the ground. \n\n“Wait,” I said, “what are you doing?” \n\n“I’m going to go check it out.” He replied. \n\nHe started to walk back. \n\n“Don’t do that,” I tried to explain, “the other day I was down here and I heard something and there was some creature down here.”\n\nI had to tell him no matter how onsrud it sounded \n\n“Creature,” He laughed, “There’s no creature. It’s probably just some kids playing some tricks on us.” \n\n“No it’s not,” I pleaded with him not to go down there, “There’s something down there. It chased me. If you go down there it will chase you.” \n\n“If it’s a fucking creature then we’ll find it and get rid of it.” Bradley said. \n\nI ran up to him and grabbed his arm. \n\n“You can’t go down there.”\n\nI tried my best to stop him. He pushed me away. \n\n“Wait here, I’ll be back.” He assured me. \n\nI waited. He slowly walked down into the dark path. Suddenly the lights on the wall went out. \n\n“Bradley!” I yelled.\n\n“What the fuck!” He yelled form down the hall. \n\nI then heard the sound of him screaming in pain. I walked slowly up to the hallway. Just then another subway started to come down and the halls started shaking. \n\n“Fuck.” I yelled to myself. \n\nJust then I saw the bold outlined shadow of what looked to be a creature, almost 8 feet tall. It was gray and skinny but other than that, I couldn't make out much more. I started sprinting towards the stairs. I wouldn't make the same mistake twice. I reached the stairs and started running towards the light at the top. I didn’t hear the creature following me like last time, but I didn’t stop to look back.\n\nI finally reached the top of the stairs. Without hesitation I jumped into the van and drove away. I didn’t think the creature would come into the light of day, but I wasn’t going to risk it. As I was in the car I fiddled through my bag to reach my phone. Why did he have to go down there? Fuck. There’s no way he’s safe. He’s definitely dead.  \n\nI couldn't blame myself. If I went down there to save him, I’d be dead too. I couldn't have told him before, he never would have believed me. \n\nI finally got a hand on my phone and I called the police. I waited until the police arrived before turning back. After hours of talking with police they let me go. I returned home and immediately laid down. I couldn't not for the life of me explain properly what happened in the tunnels. \n\nWeeks passed and I couldn't sleep. I was having nightmares on an almost daily occurrence. If the first time wasn’t hard enough, this was even worse. I had watched a man be taken, killed or I don’t even know, by that thing in the tunnel. All I know is that the only thing the officers found when they went down there was a pile of broken tools and old clothes.  \n\nI asked them about the door and they said they found one but it was locked. They couldn't break into it because they didn’t have any warrant from the city and even if they did, it was a very thick door and very hard to break down. \n\nThis means that whoever or whatever was behind this had come back after I was there and closed the door to cover up their tracks. I couldn't take this anymore so I went to my boss the next day and told him I quit. He understood and I left never to return. \n\nBut thinking back on it raised a lot of questions. What was the thing on the wall? What was the newspaper doing there? What was the tape in the VCR? There were so many questions. The most concerning one though, if there was blood on the door, then had people gone down there before? If they couldn't find Bradley, then was he taken to some lair somewhere? Were others taken there? If they didn’t find the creature and the doors were left open, then did it leave?\n\nI could have made this the end and just moved on with my life but no, in fact it was just the beginning.",

        "text": "  \n\nPerry County Documentary Evidence\n\nTo Be Viewed by Authorized Agents Only\n\nMy name is Raleigh Partain. I am 22 years old. My address is 324 Forlane Ct. I’m writing this document to explain what happened to me and hoping that this testament will lead to the conviction of my tormentor. \n\nI was enrolled in Avalon College majoring in Chemistry. I didn’t live on campus but commuted about 23 miles from home. I was still living with my parents, but after that semester I had planned on moving out of the house. I needed about 34 hours to graduate. I had met my girlfriend Lisa in freshman English and we were ready to take the next step. She was close to graduating herself. It’s her I think about the most while I try to mentally escape the memory of my ordeal. I daydream about the apartment we would have rented and the weekends we would have spent on the lake. \n\nOne Friday we were leaving campus. I want to say it was the 23rd of October. She usually would just ride with me but her SUV was acting up and she was going to drop it off with a mechanic that was a family friend. I was following her in my car. There was a cold misty rain ponding on the road. We were merging onto the interstate from the on ramp. As Lisa started to move into the nearest lane a car barely missed her and I could hear the muffled blast of angry honking. She jerked the SUV back to the right and hydroplaned. The left side of the car lifted up into the air and then tumble onto the roof. The vehicle slid on its roof and into the shoulder of the road crashing into the guard rail.  \n\nI pulled off to the side of the road behind her vehicle. I jumped out of my car and ran to the side of her window. When I bent down, I was shocked to see her sitting on the roof with her back to me. It just struck me as odd that she wasn’t thrown out of the windshield. I could hear her crying. \n\n“Bunny, are you alright?” That’s what I called her. \n\nWith her legs she scooted around to face me. She was holding her right arm and I could see that her wrist or something was broken. Her hand was dangling in an unnatural position. There was no rigidity to it. It looked as if you could have easily pushed the palm of her hand to her forearm. There was a deep gash across her forehead and right eye. I was about to vomit but I had to pull it together for her. \n\n“No, I’m not alright.”\n\n“Hey, is everything ok. Do you need me to call 911?” I heard someone yell from behind me. \n\n“Yes, please. I haven’t called. Bunny, can you come on out? I’ll help you.”\n\n“I’m so sorry.” She started to say as she was sobbing. \n\nI kind of chuckled. “What are you apologizing for?”\n\n“I almost hit that woman. It was my fault.”\n\n“Bunny, that wasn’t your fault. I saw the whole thing. Every bit of it. That woman was an asshole. You were nowhere near hitting her. It’s her fault. She scared you and made you react.” \n\nReally it was Lisa’s fault. That woman did a good job avoiding a collision but I didn’t need my girlfriend worrying about any additional bullshit. With slow and methodical precision, I got her out through the shards of glass and broken window. I gave her my jacket and started to walk her back to my car. The man that had called 911 came over and gave her his jacket to stop the bleeding from her forehead. \n\n“Oh no, I don’t want to ruin your jacket.” \n\n“Don’t worry about it ma’am. I can always get another jacket.”\n\nI told the man thank you. I noticed that another car had pulled over and I waved at that guy to let him know that everything was alright. I put Lisa in the passenger side, started the car and cranked up the heater so she would be warm. \n\n“Well, I guess I gave the mechanic a little more work to do.” We laughed, but she writhed in pain as she did so. Finally, we heard the sirens approaching. It was a fire engine and an ambulance. I got out of the car and waved them over to Lisa. The paramedics came over to check on her and did their thing. They bandaged up her head but they didn’t do anything with her wrist. They put her on a stretcher and wheeled her to the ambulance. I was following behind when she motioned to me. \n\n“Could you grab my purse?”\n\n“Sure. What hospital are you guys taking her to?”\n\n‘St. Vincent.”\n\n“Ok. Thanks!”\n\nAs I was walking back to Lisa’s vehicle, I saw a paramedic picking up a necklace from the ground and putting it into his pocket. I was sure it was the necklace I had bought Lisa last year for her birthday.\n\n“Hey, what in the hell are you doing! Give me that necklace.”\n\n“Oh yeah sure. I was bringing it to her.”\n\nHe took the necklace out of his pocket, spilling other valuables to the ground. \n\n“Are you fucking kidding me! Get out of here. I’m going to report you. Lousy son of a bitch!\n\n“I wasn’t stealing anything. I was gathering all her stuff together.”\n\n“You could have just brought her purse with everything in it.”\n\nHe walked off without saying anything else. In addition to her necklace, I picked up a ring and her flash drive. I went and grabbed her purse and some other items. I put everything in the purse. I stood up only to see that same paramedic behind my car, writing on a pad of paper. He was writing down my license plate number. I thought that was odd so I started running towards him, but he jumped into the back of the ambulance before I could catch him. I thought well I won’t make a big deal out of it. I was trying to do better. I have been accused of exaggerating things and maybe I was doing the same in this situation. I don’t know. I just wanted to get to the hospital and be with Lisa. \n\nI stayed the whole night with her, sleeping on the chair next to her bed. She had some major injuries, but nothing that was going to be permanent- a limp wrist and some stitches in her head. I was worried about her, yet I felt a little guilty because I was more worried about that paramedic. Why was he looking at my license plate and worse, writing it down?\n\nThe next morning, I went home and took a shower. I was exhausted. I didn’t sleep too well in that hospital chair, and I was still too agitated to go to sleep, so I took a shot of cold medicine and drank a six pack. I went to my bedroom window and looked outside at the sunrise. It was a picture-perfect setting, with orange, pink, and purple splashed up against a blue background. I noticed a red truck with a camper over the bed. I had never seen that truck before, and I was sure it didn’t belong to any of my neighbors. I could see on the back window a medical type of sticker, that signifies that whoever owned the truck worked in the medical industry. I heard a shuffle and caught a glimpse of a person’s reflection in the window, but not before I could turn around. I felt a sharp point in my neck, and I could see in the window that behind me was that paramedic and he had just shoved a syringe into my neck. My legs went limp, and I slumped to the ground and lost consciousness. \n\nI woke up in a wheelchair with my legs and arms handcuffed together. I was in a room with shelving units full of glass jars. There were also glass display cases. There were a variety of trinkets and novelties. Most had jewelry but some were a little more macabre. I noticed a finger in one, a toe in another. There was a particularly large jar with a heart in it. Each jar had a label attached with a name, date, and a small description. I only knew this because my wheelchair was close to a shelf that had a collection of rings. One display had a finger with a golden ring on it. The label attached to it read:\n\nCarl Harrison, 10/2/2015, Wife cut off finger after finding out he cheated. Wedding band included.\n\n“Welcome to my collection. It’s beautiful isn’t it. I’ve taken something from every call I’ve ever been on and some unofficial calls if you know what I mean.”\n\n“Why do you have me here? Please let me go…. I”\n\nHe interrupted me before I could say anything else. “You know this is my most ambitious project yet. I was just going to take the necklace and a few other items. There was not much to this call. Not a lot of gore or mess…. No story behind the trinkets, or at least not a good one, but then I thought this is my chance to try something I’ve always thought of. I wasn’t ready to try it just yet, but you pissed me off. I’m going to make you an incorruptible. Have you ever heard of that? No, I doubt you have. In Catholicism there are supposed saints that have died, but their bodies have not decayed. I think its bullshit, but I like the idea of having an incorruptible body in my collection. It's no miracle. You just got to have the appropriate conditions and the correct procedure. It can’t be that hard. Stalin under the Soviet Union did it to Lenin and now I’m going to do it to you.”\n\nHe pushed me around his collection of jewelry and body parts. He made me listen to the stories about each of his calls and what they meant to him spiritually and why he decided to take what he took. There was an art to it. There was nothing random about it. Each item he collected was the most significant symbol he could use to represent that particular instance of human suffering. It took about an hour. It was an extensive collection. I admit I was amazed and horrified by his creativity. \n\n“But you, yes you, are going to be my most prized possession. You represent, or should I say will represent the frozen aspirations of a life that never will be. A living statue frozen in time. A novelty representing more than one moment, but an entire wasted life.”\n\nAfter the tour he wheeled me into a room with a mattress and a bucket. He turned to walk out the room and gave me the most heartfelt look I had ever seen. From that stare, I knew he loved me, not as a person, but as a thing, a possession to be worked on and manipulated. \n\n“Try to relax. I will be back later to knock you out and take you out of that uncomfortable chair.”\n\nHe turned out the light and walked out the door. I could hear the dead-bolt snap into place and an echo reverberate through the thick heavy steel door. He looked through the wire-enforced door lite and waved. \n\nHe fed me once a day, but it was a very low-calorie diet consisting of nothing but chicken broth. I guess he wanted me skinnier than I was. He had shaved off all of my body hair. I felt like a naked mole rat. I knew that my end was approaching. I didn’t know how he was going to do it, but I knew I couldn’t escape. He never let me out. Sometimes he brought in a gurney, knocked me out with a concoction of drugs fed through an intravenous line. He was doing something when I was under. The transformation was under way. \n\nEvery day he took me on the same tour, showing me the same damned displays, so much so that I memorized most of the layout. I noticed a severed delicate hand with manicured nails holding a pen. I decided that with a little patience and at the right moment I would swipe that pen and use it as a weapon. I kept track of the days by counting the tours he insisted on having consistently at the same time every day. It was about five days from the first time the idea had sprung to my mind to get the pen that my chance came. He parked my wheelchair right beside it. Luckily, even with the handcuffs, I was able to reach the pen and wiggle it from the previous owner’s hand. He didn’t even notice, because often he would get consumed in thought about one particular object- a gold watch he had stolen from a house where a woman had committed suicide by overdosing on prescription pills. The more he talked about it the more I was convinced he knew the woman, may have even obsessed about being with her. As he was mesmerized by the watch, I worked the pen up under my sleeve and cupped my hand hoping like hell that it wouldn’t fall to the floor. He finally came out of his stupor. \n\n“Time to get you back to bed sleepy head.”\n\nI had started to forge a plan in my head for escape. I disciplined myself to focus on his routines and mannerisms to see if I could notice if he was making any mistakes or if there was an unnoticed opportunity to gain an advantage over him. After some time, I did notice that sometimes he was in a catatonic state, or at least not perceptive of his surroundings. He would do the tour, but it wasn’t as energetic. It was rote, just going through the motions, but a necessary routine he could not avoid. More importantly, I noticed that sometimes he would unfasten my handcuffs before I was completely knocked-out, sure that I was too weak to do anything. This would be my plan. I just had to hope that he never found that pen or noticed that it was gone. Luckily, he always walked past the hand without a notice. I figured it wasn’t his favorite work of art, but I knew that it was only a matter of time before he would see that the hand was missing its pen. I had to make my move. He was going to be in that mood one day and I was going to fake being under faster than normal. When he unlocked my first handcuff, I was going to stab him in the neck or eye. I hadn’t decided just yet. I didn’t know which would be the more fatal spot, which would give me the best advantage to finish the bastard off. \n\nBut that day didn’t come for a while. He must have been well stocked with medication during that time frame. One day he came down jumping around ecstatic with joy and excited to see me. \n\n“I have a surprise for you,” he yelled through the door. “Get in your wheelchair and fasten your handcuffs.”\n\nI did as he commanded. He was fidgety and impatient, pacing back and forth. “Hurry up. Come on.” When I had finally fastened all my shackles, he unlocked the deadbolt and lunged through the door. He pushed my wheelchair back to the display room and we went through the same old performance, a sad lonely tour guide recounting the escapades of his mentally deranged adventures. I was confused. Why was he so excited? Did he add something significant to his collection. I saw nothing new. When he finished, he wheeled me out the door and into an adjoining room I had never even perceived to have existed. He turned on the light.\n\n“And now the new addition. The largest expansion of this here establishment since the beginning.”\n\nThe room was empty except for a table with a pink tablecloth and something big underneath. He walked over to the cloth and yanked it to the ground. \n\n“Ta-da.”\n\nMy stomach churned and I got light-headed. There on the table was a large glass case shaped like a coffin. Laying in the coffin was my Lisa. She was wearing one of her floral dresses. Her neck had been slashed and crudely sewn back together. He had put make-up on her face, but it looked like something a child would do, caked on eyeliner and bright red lips, her face painted white. I don’t know if he did it out of mockery or thought that was how to apply make-up, but it enraged me. \n\n“You fucking son of a bitch. I’m going to kill you!! I’m going to rip your head off!!!\n\n“Oh, shut up. I did you a favor. You belong together. I don’t understand. You should be happy I brought her here because I knew you missed her.”\n\nOf course, I wasn’t listening. I was still raging on. He finally got tired of my yelling and wheeled me back to my room. He put in the intravenous line and knocked me out. \n\nI believe a few weeks had passed. I was determined now to try to escape if only to be able to cause him harm. He may get the better of me, but I was going to make him pay. He may win the fight, but not without a price. That day finally came. He was in that careless mood, living somewhere deep in his head. The new tour always took me by Lisa and the sickening progress he was making in turning her into an incorruptible. He had decided to do the procedure on her first to make me suffer. He was making me witness her transformation. It made me nauseous to see her and her gradual demise from a beautiful living woman to a still-born mass of flesh and bone. She looked like a mannequin now, smooth and without texture. \n\n“She is so beautiful.”\n\n“You mean she was beautiful, until you ruined her.”\n\nHe didn’t respond. He just stared at me for a moment and shook his head. \n\n“You know I’m missing a pen from one of my exhibits. I wonder where it could be.” He reached in his pocket and pulled the pen out. “You are the one ruining things. I ought to punish you.” He stood there for a moment and then all of a sudden as if a thought had jumped in his head, he walked over and stabbed the pen into my right leg above the knee. I screeched in pain, and I felt my blood boil with a rush of adrenaline and anger. He jerked my wheelchair around and pushed me hard out the door. \n\n“I’m so sick of you. I should just kill you right now. I don’t need you for my exhibit. I have Lisa. Yes, I know her name. I followed her forever. Learned everything about her. Maybe an extra dose tonight and I'll be done with you.\"\n\nHe left me out in the hallway. Didn’t even want to wait until we got to the room. He opened up a closet door and rolled out the intravenous stand. He took a syringe from the closet as well. I guess this was going to be my extra dose. He shoved the line into my vein and then stuck the syringe in my shoulder. I thought to myself this was it. I had to put my plan into action. I started faking all kinds of symptoms- coughing, spitting, and gasping for air. I may have overdone it a little. Hell, for all I knew it was only some sort of sedative he had given me, and all that talk was bluff. I didn’t know, but overacting or not he bought it. It was expected behavior. Whatever he had given me was meant to kill. I started feeling my chest swell and my heart rate increase. I was shaking, unable to control my muscle movement. At that point I passed out. \n\nAs I awakened, I noticed that I had been wheeled back to my room. He had unfastened the cuffs from my hands and was working on the cuff on my right leg. I realized that I had been blessed with an opportunity. He thought that I was still unconscious. I remember when I was a kid, I had awakened in the middle of an ear surgery. The doctors had quickly put a mask back on my face and I felt the cool gas seep into my nostrils and down into my lungs. I had this one chance. I looked down and saw that the pen was still in my leg. He moved over to unfasten the cuff from my left leg, and I saw his neck exposed. With my left hand I grabbed his hair and held on like a vise grip. I pulled the pen out of my leg and stuck it in his neck. He squirmed and yelled, almost getting out of my grip and then like a mad man I stabbed him as many times as I could aiming for that huge pulsating vein that I had just noticed in the frenzy of my madness. I focused intently on that spot and just kept stabbing. He tried to loosen my grip and he turned his head up at me. His left eye was exposed, wide and moistened with tears of pain. I plunged the pen in his eye and shoved him back. I bolted out of the wheelchair but almost fell, since my legs were so weak. I stiffened up and made my way out of the room and up the stairs. The door was opened, and I ran through the kitchen and out the front door. \n\nI escaped physically but mentally I am still imprisoned. I cannot rest easy. He has taken from me not only the woman I loved but the ability to live a normal life. I have the most insane phobias now, the most notable is a fear of ambulances. I have panic attacks when I hear a siren and God forbid, I see an ambulance. I hope he gets the death penalty, and everything goes wrong. I hope its long and painful, because in my mind he did not fail. He achieved exactly what he was trying to accomplish. I am an incorruptible. My body looks alive and beyond decay, but inside I am dead and on display in a madman’s museum of psychopathic desires.",

        "text": "My sister told me about a place where people noclip. \n\nSeriously.\n\nI was as shocked as you are.\n\n“It’s not far from here,” she said. “This guy I work with was talking about it. One of the bouncers. He claimed his best friend went right through it a year ago and was never heard from again.”\n\n“Is he crazy?” I asked.\n\n“Who? The guy I work with? Or his friend?”\n\n“Both of them I guess.”\n\n“Yeah. I guess they’re both crazy. Crazy enough,” she responded, laughing it off.\n\nI took a sip of my small-batch ginger ale. “Well where is it? This place where people noclip?”\n\n“Like I told you, it’s not far from here. Out in the desert. You head east on Interstate 6 for about forty miles.”\n\n“Weird. Then what?”\n\n“... You’re not actually thinking about going there, are you?”\n\n“I might be.”\n\n“Don’t. Like I said, that guy is crazy.”\n\n“Okay. But for the sake of argument…”\n\n“For the sake of argument what?”\n\n“For the sake of argument let’s say he’s not crazy. How would you get there?”\n\n“For the sake of argument, assuming he’s not crazy, the guy says that about forty miles up Interstate 6 there’s a dusty ochre pickup truck abandoned on the side of the road that's been there since 1987. Make a right at the pickup truck and follow the unmarked road, until the street signs stop. You’ll know the place when you get there.”\n\n“How?”\n\n“You just will.”\n\n“How far is it though?”\n\n“The guy says it’s far enough.”\n\n“Fine. What then?”\n\n“Don’t give me attitude or I won’t tell you how to get there.”\n\n“My sincerest apologies.”\n\n“That didn’t sound sincere. But I forgive you.”\n\n“Appreciate you, Sis. What then?”\n\n“Then you park. But it has to be at sunset. That’s what the bouncer tells me. For whatever reason, the thing is only there for about five minutes around sunset.”\n\n“What thing?”\n\n“The cassette store.”\n\n“They still make cassettes?”\n\n“They must, if there’s a whole store for them. Come on, use your critical thinking skills.”\n\n“Fair.”\n\n“Go inside the cassette store. And make sure to say hi to the guy who works there.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Because he doesn’t get many customers.”\n\n“Oh. But that’s not part of the noclipping?”\n\n“No, it’s just a polite thing to do.”\n\n“Got it.”\n\n“Say hi to the guy, then go to the new releases section, and find the Fleetwood Mac tapes.”\n\n“... This is sounding complicated.”\n\n“Would you stop interrupting me? If it weren’t complicated, more people would know about it.”\n\n“Fair.”\n\n“So next, you grab two copies of Fleetwood Mac’s *Tango in the Night*.”\n\n“What about *Tusk*?”\n\n“What about it?”\n\n“Can I get *Tusk* instead? It’s a better album.”\n\n“You’re not buying it. You’re borrowing it.”\n\n“Oh. Thanks for clarifying.”\n\n“Anyway, it has to be *Tango in the Night*.”\n\n“Noted.”\n\n“Grab the tapes, and when the guy isn’t looking, slip them into your pockets.”\n\n“Hold up. Wait a second.”\n\n“What? For the love of God, what?”\n\n“I’ve never shoplifted before.”\n\n“You’re not shoplifting.”\n\n“Then why am I putting tapes in my pockets?”\n\n“Because you’re not allowed to bring merchandise into the restroom.”\n\n“Uh…”\n\n“The next step is you go to the restroom.”\n\n“What if I don’t have to go?”\n\n“…”\n\n“Fine, fine, so I take the two copies of *Tango in the Night* – not my favorite Fleetwood Mac record by the way – I put them in my pockets, and I sneak them into the women’s room.”\n\n“Men’s room.”\n\n“I sneak them into the men’s room.”\n\n“Yeah.”\n\n“Okay. So I’m in the men’s restroom with the contraband. Then what?”\n\n“Go to the third urinal from the door.”\n\n“This sounds like a big bathroom for a cassette store that’s only open five minutes at a time.”\n\n“Yeah, it’s huge. So you go to the third urinal, and you put the two tapes next to each other in the urinal, and you climb up into the urinal, and stand on top of the tapes. One for each foot.”\n\n“You sure it’ll hold my weight?”\n\n“Oh yeah, it’s an American Standard.”\n\n“Damn.”\n\n“And that’s when you noclip. You’ll go right through the bottom of the urinal. Right through the floor of the cassette store. Right through the earth itself. And you’ll enter the space below.”\n\n“... Hell?”\n\n“Huh?”\n\n“I’ll enter Hell?”\n\n“What? No. I didn’t know you were religious.”\n\n“I’m not. I just thought you were using a euphemism for Hell.”\n\n“I wasn’t.”\n\n“Okay, sorry. So it’s not Hell?”\n\n“No, it’s the space below. The void. The bardo. Some third synonym.”\n\n“Then what?”\n\n“What do you mean ‘then what’? That’s it. You’re all done. You have successfully noclipped.”\n\n“Damn.”\n\n“But don’t do it.”\n\n“Oh, yeah. Yeah, of course.”\n\n“You’re not thinking about doing it, are you?”\n\n“Me? Nah.”\n\n“Because it’s dangerous.”\n\n“For sure.”\n\n“Very dangerous.”\n\n“Totally.”\n\n“So you won’t do it?”\n\n“Scout’s honor.”\n\n“Good.”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThere I was, standing on the precipice of fate, one *Tango in the Night* in each hand and a triple-flushed urinal glistening before me. One of the *Tango*s was a used copy, but I figured that would be okay. I figured a *Tango* was a *Tango*. It was VG+ anyway and had barely been played.\n\nI placed the tapes side by side in the trough, and I mounted my steed.\n\nInstantly something went wrong. My steed bucked. \n\nMy stomach jumped into my chest and my body tumbled forward, but I did not bang my forehead on the American Standard’s ergonomic flusher assembly. No. \n\nI had not fallen off the urinal, but rather *through* the urinal, as I had been direly warned would happen. Big yikes. But also hell yes.\n\nAs my body fell forward, I osmosed first through the bathroom wall, then through its gorgeously mosaiced tile floor (seriously, this bathroom), tumbling forward through the very foundations of Murphy’s Tapes itself.\n\nMy heart pounded and my sweat… uh… I sweated a lot.\n\nLooking up, the structure of the cassette store was laid out above me like an architectural blueprint. I could see into every room in the building. I watched the bottoms of Greg’s feet as he dawdled about behind the counter (Greg was the sole employee). In the distance, the underside of cars glided by on the highway, with their driveshafts and rust-specked piping exposed.\n\nIt didn’t take long for me to realize that I wasn’t falling anymore. I seemed to be levitating about 50 feet below ground level. From this depth, I could make out the sketchy outlines of long-dead animal remains, wells that had been dug decades ago and summarily abandoned, roots of telephone poles protruding beneath the desert’s surface.\n\nFurther below me was a pale blue void. My eyes hated that, so I instructed them not to look in its direction.\n\nInstead, I focused my mind on movement (“move damn you!”) and began to fly parallel to the ground, first at cautious speeds, then incautious ones, faster and faster, until I found myself zooming perilously beneath I-80 toward the exurbs of Reno. The buildings above danced past me, semi-transparent rectangles that were broken into smaller rectangles for each room, the way you can draw the [golden spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_spiral) as a collection of smaller and smaller rectangles disappearing into infinity.\n\nAt last I found myself soaring beneath Reno, with its fantasia of lights blinking on to celebrate the dusk. The multiple stories of each building provided densely packed layers of observable activity, tourists isolated in their little box rooms, escalator machinery humming, distant faces illuminated by the glow of screens, the soles of shoes gathered around roulette tables, asses locked into dingy seats next to their favorite slot machines.\n\nThe whole time, there was this strange feeling of freedom I never had before. I rarely ever felt like I was a part of the world, but now I was strictly outside it, an observer, a dislocated person. And from a distance I could finally see. All these people were living their lives in apparent isolation. Is that all I was, this entire time? A person in a box? A person in the flow state of themselves? Locked into the dingy seat next to the slot machine of my life?\n\nI soared further now, past the apartment buildings and hospitals and schools and malls, with Pyramid Lake appearing in the distance as a jagged blue bowl filled with trout and tui chub, decorated with moored fishing boats and wobbling jet skis.\n\nBut above me, directly above me, was my sister’s apartment complex. \n\nTime to spook the heck out of her.\n\nI held out my hands to slow myself down, then with a few swimmer’s kicks managed to bring myself up through the floor of the apartment below hers, then through the floor of her living room. I found myself floating in front of her muted TV.\n\nI looked around the room and saw her in the kitchen, standing in front of the freezer with the door wide open, deciding which of two frozen meals would feed the dragon of her stomach tonight.\n\n“Boo,” I said.\n\nShe didn’t respond.\n\n“Hey. Sis. Boo”\n\nShe couldn’t see me.\n\n“Sis.”\n\nStill nothing.\n\nI reached out a hand to touch her shoulder. As I got nearer she seemed to turn toward me, but could not see.\n\nWhen I made contact with her shoulder, everything gave out. The collision detection algorithm of reality must have been broken, because the moment of contact sent me into a total freefall.\n\nI plummeted. \n\nMy body passed through the carpeting of her living room, then into the apartment below hers, then the unfinished basement of her building, descending down into the pale blue vastness. The bardo. The space below. The great synonym generator beneath our feet.\n\nThe world above me got smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, until it was nothing but a single pixel rotating in the void.\n\nWith nothing to compare my location against, all velocities in this non-space became the same velocity. Maybe I was sailing past at Mach speed. Maybe I was still and stationary as a monk.\n\nThat’s when I realized there was something down here with me. \n\nA small piece of geometry, off in the distance. Quickly the geometry became a box, and the box became a room. It had taken on some kind of gravity, sucking me toward it with increasingly irresistible force. Flail and contort as I might, I couldn’t escape its gravity well as I was sucked closer and closer to the event horizon of its four walls. \n\nThere was no avoiding it.\n\nI closed my eyes and gritted my teeth. There was a deafening SCHLUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP, a sound so massive and unusual that onomatopoeia really fails to do it justice. I guess you just had to be there.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nWhen I opened my eyes I was lying on my back in a small symmetrical room.\n\nI looked around me. The furniture was austere and low-poly, just a bed and a dresser and a Fleetwood Mac calendar on the wall. The calendar showed the page for March 1987.\n\nI rose to my feet and realized the awful truth: there were no doors or windows in this room. To be sure, I walked the perimeter, feeling around the edges, and confirmed the horrible truth. \n\nWhen I got to the calendar, I noticed that the print on it was pixelated and low-res, like a poor-quality jpeg had been used to create it. I tried to turn the page from March 1987 to now (since it was significantly later). But the calendar pages didn’t turn. The material was some kind of concrete, rough and cold to the touch.\n\nIn fact, it turned out everything in the room was made out of the same concrete material. Which meant that I was stuck in a room with no doors or windows. No way to get out. There was a uniform amount of light in every corner of the room, so I could see just fine, despite the fact that there seemed to be no light sources at all. \n\nThe room must have been an unfinished part of the map. A part of reality they built but never used. Who were *they*? Were they God? Were they the Developers? And if they were the Developers, were they still developing? And what are they developing? And why?\n\nThose are good questions, friend. You are full of good questions today, aren’t you. Unfortunately, I was and continue to be answerless.\n\nOne nice thing is I don’t get hungry down here. I don’t get tired, I don’t get thirsty, and I never have to use the restroom.\n\nOne not nice thing is that about 44 minutes into my stay at the Hotel Pale Blue Void (Room 1), *Tango in the Night* began to play at full volume. When the initial shock wore off, I began to listen more carefully to the recording. It sounded like an mp3 played at about 96 kbps. You could hear artifacts in the cymbals.\n\nUnfortunately, the recording has not stopped. It seems to be playing on an infinite loop, with no end in sight (or sound). Every time it reaches the final hypnotic fadeout of “You and I, Part II,” my hopes are smashed when the whole thing just starts from the top again, with the cymbal crescendo of “Big Love.”\n\nAfter 38 hours of this, *Tango in the Night* began to grow on me. By hour 923, I had developed enough lung capacity from singing along to the record that when the title track played I could hold the word “[tangoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo](https://youtu.be/i_xlI6gMH7U?t=126)” nearly as long as Lindsey Buckingham (but not nearly as well).\n\nBy hour 723,298,519,823,479,825 I had developed a profound psychic connection with the secret meanings behind the record that those in power did not want us to know. For instance I learned that, at its core, the album was about a tango. In the night.\n\nWhatever you do, do not send help. \n\nSomeone else could get trapped down here, and I must warn you it is a fate worse than death. Unless you’re an absolutely enormous fan of this album. But probably even then too.\n\nI’ve been looking for places in the room where I can noclip outta Dodge. This is a slow process. Every millimeter of wall, floor, ceiling, bed, and poster needs to be examined. The direction I am facing may have an impact. Whether or not my shoes are tied. Whether or not my jacket is zipped. There are so many permutations and possibilities, even within this tiny space.\n\nSo far I have failed to noclip out of the *Tango* room. But I feel like I am making progress.\n\nAnd now I must deliver my message. A message which is my purpose here and maybe even my purpose in life. \n\nIf you’re out there, if you can hear me, whatever you do, do not grab your *Tango*s *in the Night* from the used section. Grab both *Tango*s from the new release section, like an adult, or your fate (unlike one of my *Tangos*) will be sealed.",

        "text": "My sister told me about a place where people noclip. \n\nSeriously.\n\nI was as shocked as you are.\n\n“It’s not far from here,” she said. “This guy I work with was talking about it. One of the &gt;!bouncers!&lt;. He claimed his best friend went right through it a year ago and was never heard from again.”\n\n“Is he crazy?” I asked.\n\n“Who? The guy I work with? Or his friend?”\n\n“Both of them I guess.”\n\n“Yeah. I guess they’re both crazy. Crazy enough,” she responded, laughing it off.\n\nI took a sip of my small-batch &gt;!ginger ale!&lt;. “Well where is it? This place where people noclip?”\n\n“Like I told you, it’s not far from here. Out in the desert. You head &gt;!east!&lt; on &gt;!Interstate 6!&lt; for about &gt;!forty!&lt; miles.”\n\n“Weird. Then what?”\n\n“... You’re not actually thinking about going there, are you?”\n\n“I might be.”\n\n“Don’t. Like I said, that guy is crazy.”\n\n“Okay. But for the sake of argument…”\n\n“For the sake of argument what?”\n\n“For the sake of argument let’s say he’s not crazy. How would you get there?”\n\n“For the sake of argument, assuming he’s not crazy, the guy says that about &gt;!forty!&lt; miles up &gt;!Interstate 6!&lt; there’s a dusty ochre &gt;!pickup truck!&lt; abandoned on the side of the road that's been there since &gt;!1987!&lt;. Make a right at the pickup truck and follow the &gt;!unmarked road!&lt;, until the street signs stop. You’ll know the place when you get there.”\n\n“How?”\n\n“You just will.”\n\n“How far is it though?”\n\n“The guy says it’s far enough.”\n\n“Fine. What then?”\n\n“Don’t give me attitude or I won’t tell you how to get there.”\n\n“My sincerest apologies.”\n\n“That didn’t sound sincere. But I forgive you.”\n\n“Appreciate you, Sis. What then?”\n\n“Then you park. But it has to be at &gt;!sunset!&lt;. That’s what the &gt;!bouncer!&lt; tells me. For whatever reason, the thing is only there for about &gt;!five minutes!&lt; around &gt;!sunset!&lt;.”\n\n“What thing?”\n\n“The &gt;!cassette!&lt; store.”\n\n“They still make &gt;!cassettes!&lt;?”\n\n“They must, if there’s a whole store for them. Come on, use your critical thinking skills.”\n\n“Fair.”\n\n“Go inside the &gt;!cassette!&lt; store. And make sure to say hi to the guy who works there.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“&gt;!Because he doesn’t get many customers.!&lt;”\n\n“Oh. But that’s not part of the noclipping?”\n\n“No, it’s just a polite thing to do.”\n\n“Got it.”\n\n“Say hi to the guy, then go to the &gt;!new releases!&lt; section, and find the &gt;!Fleetwood Mac!&lt; tapes.”\n\n“... This is sounding complicated.”\n\n“Would you stop interrupting me? If it weren’t complicated, more people would know about it.”\n\n“Fair.”\n\n“So next, you grab two copies of &gt;!Fleetwood Mac!&lt;’s &gt;!Tango in the Night!&lt;.”\n\n“What about &gt;!Tusk!&lt;?”\n\n“What about it?”\n\n“Can I get &gt;!Tusk!&lt; instead? It’s a better album.”\n\n“You’re not buying it. You’re borrowing it.”\n\n“Oh. Thanks for clarifying.”\n\n“Anyway, it has to be &gt;!Tango in the Night!&lt;.”\n\n“Noted.”\n\n“Grab the &gt;!tapes!&lt;, and when the guy isn’t looking, slip them into your pockets.”\n\n“Hold up. Wait a second.”\n\n“What? For the love of God, what?”\n\n“I’ve never shoplifted before.”\n\n“You’re not shoplifting.”\n\n“Then why am I putting &gt;!tapes!&lt; in my pockets?”\n\n“Because you’re not allowed to bring merchandise into the &gt;!restroom!&lt;.”\n\n“Uh…”\n\n“The next step is you go to the &gt;!restroom!&lt;.”\n\n“What if I don’t have to go?”\n\n“…”\n\n“Fine, fine, so I take the two copies of &gt;!Tango in the Night!&lt; – not my favorite &gt;!Fleetwood Mac!&lt; record by the way – I put them in my pockets, and I sneak them into the &gt;!women’s room!&lt;.”\n\n“&gt;!Men’s room!&lt;.”\n\n“I sneak them into the &gt;!men’s room?!&lt;”\n\n“Yeah.”\n\n“Okay. So I’m in the &gt;!men’s restroom!&lt; with the contraband. Then what?”\n\n“Go to the third &gt;!urinal!&lt; from the door.”\n\n“This sounds like a big &gt;!bathroom!&lt; for a &gt;!cassette!&lt; store that’s only open &gt;!five minutes!&lt; at a time.”\n\n“Yeah, it’s huge. So you go to the third &gt;!urinal!&lt;, and you put the two &gt;!tapes!&lt; next to each other in the urinal, and you climb up into the &gt;!urinal!&lt;, and stand on top of the &gt;!tapes!&lt;. One for each foot.”\n\n“You sure it’ll hold my weight?”\n\n“Oh yeah, it’s an &gt;!American Standard!&lt;.”\n\n“Damn.”\n\n“And that’s when you noclip. You’ll go right through the bottom of the &gt;!urinal!&lt;. Right through the floor of the &gt;!cassette!&lt; store. Right through the earth itself. And you’ll enter &gt;!the space below!&lt;.”\n\n“... &gt;!Hell!&lt;?”\n\n“Huh?”\n\n“I’ll enter &gt;!Hell!&lt;?”\n\n“What? No. I didn’t know you were &gt;!religious!&lt;.”\n\n“I’m not. I just thought you were using a euphemism for &gt;!Hell!&lt;.”\n\n“I wasn’t.”\n\n“Okay, sorry. So it’s not &gt;!Hell!&lt;?”\n\n“No, it’s &gt;!the space below!&lt;. &gt;!The void!&lt;. &gt;!The bardo!&lt;. &gt;!Some third synonym!&lt;.”\n\n“Then what?”\n\n“What do you mean ‘then what’? That’s it. You’re all done. You have successfully noclipped.”\n\n“Damn.”\n\n“But don’t do it.”\n\n“Oh, yeah. Yeah, of course.”\n\n“You’re not thinking about doing it, are you?”\n\n“Me? Nah.”\n\n“Because it’s dangerous.”\n\n“For sure.”\n\n“Very dangerous.”\n\n“Totally.”\n\n“So you won’t do it?”\n\n“Scout’s honor.”\n\n“Good.”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThere I was, standing on the precipice of fate, one &gt;!Tango in the Night!&lt; in each hand and a triple-flushed &gt;!urinal!&lt; glistening before me. One of the &gt;!Tangos!&lt; was a &gt;!used!&lt; copy, but I figured that would be okay. I figured a &gt;!Tango!&lt; was a &gt;!Tango!&lt;. It was &gt;!VG+!&lt; anyway and had barely been played.\n\nI placed the &gt;!tapes!&lt; side by side in the trough, and I mounted my steed.\n\nInstantly something went wrong. My steed bucked. \n\nMy stomach jumped into my chest and my body tumbled forward, but I did not bang my forehead on the &gt;!American Standard!&lt;’s ergonomic flusher assembly. No. \n\nI had not fallen off the &gt;!urinal!&lt;, but rather *through* the &gt;!urinal!&lt;, as I had been direly warned would happen. Big yikes. But also hell yes.\n\nAs my body fell forward, I osmosed first through the &gt;!bathroom!&lt; wall, then through its gorgeously mosaiced tile floor (seriously, this &gt;!bathroom!&lt;), tumbling forward through the very foundations of &gt;!Murphy’s Tapes!&lt; itself.\n\nMy heart pounded and my sweat… uh… I sweated a lot.\n\nLooking up, the structure of the &gt;!cassette!&lt; store was laid out above me like an architectural blueprint. I could see into every room in the building. I watched the bottoms of Greg’s feet as he dawdled about behind the counter (Greg was the sole employee). In the distance, the underside of cars glided by on the highway, with their driveshafts and rust-specked piping exposed.\n\nIt didn’t take long for me to realize that I wasn’t falling anymore. I seemed to be levitating about 50 feet below ground level. From this depth, I could make out the sketchy outlines of long-dead animal remains, wells that had been dug decades ago and summarily abandoned, roots of telephone poles protruding beneath the desert’s surface.\n\nFurther below me was a pale blue void. My eyes hated that, so I instructed them not to look in its direction.\n\nInstead, I focused my mind on movement (“move damn you!”) and began to fly parallel to the ground, first at cautious speeds, then incautious ones, faster and faster, until I found myself zooming perilously beneath &gt;!I-80!&lt; toward the exurbs of &gt;!Reno!&lt;. The buildings above danced past me, semi-transparent rectangles that were broken into smaller rectangles for each room, the way you can draw the [golden spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_spiral) as a collection of smaller and smaller rectangles disappearing into infinity.\n\nAt last I found myself soaring beneath Reno, with its fantasia of lights blinking on to celebrate the dusk. The multiple stories of each building provided densely packed layers of observable activity, tourists isolated in their little box rooms, escalator machinery humming, distant faces illuminated by the glow of screens, the soles of shoes gathered around &gt;!roulette!&lt; tables, asses locked into dingy seats next to their favorite &gt;!slot machines!&lt;.\n\nThe whole time, there was this strange feeling of freedom I never had before. I rarely ever felt like I was a part of the world, but now I was strictly outside it, an observer, a dislocated person. And from a distance I could finally see. All these people were living their lives in apparent isolation. Is that all I was, this entire time? A person in a box? A person in the flow state of themselves? Locked into the dingy seat next to the slot machine of my life?\n\nI soared further now, past the apartment buildings and hospitals and schools and malls, with &gt;!Pyramid Lake!&lt; appearing in the distance as a jagged blue bowl filled with trout and tui chub, decorated with moored fishing boats and wobbling jet skis.\n\nBut above me, directly above me, was my sister’s apartment complex. \n\nTime to spook the heck out of her.\n\nI held out my hands to slow myself down, then with a few swimmer’s kicks managed to bring myself up through the floor of the apartment below hers, then through the floor of her living room. I found myself floating in front of her muted TV.\n\nI looked around the room and saw her in the kitchen, standing in front of the freezer with the door wide open, deciding which of two frozen meals would feed the dragon of her stomach tonight.\n\n“Boo,” I said.\n\nShe didn’t respond.\n\n“Hey. Sis. Boo”\n\nShe couldn’t see me.\n\n“Sis.”\n\nStill nothing.\n\nI reached out a hand to touch her shoulder. As I got nearer she seemed to turn toward me, but could not see.\n\nWhen I made contact with her shoulder, everything gave out. The collision detection algorithm of reality must have been broken, because the moment of contact sent me into a total free-fall.\n\nI plummeted. \n\nMy body passed through the carpeting of her living room, then into the apartment below hers, then the unfinished basement of her building, descending down into the &gt;!pale blue vastness!&lt;. &gt;!The bardo!&lt;. &gt;!The space below!&lt;. The great synonym generator beneath our feet.\n\nThe world above me got &gt;!smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller!&lt;, until it was nothing but a single pixel rotating in &gt;!the void!&lt;.\n\nWith nothing to compare my location against, all velocities in this non-space became the same velocity. Maybe I was sailing past at Mach speed. Maybe I was still and stationary as a monk.\n\nThat’s when I realized there was something down here with me. \n\nA small piece of geometry, off in the distance. Quickly the geometry became a box, and the box became a room. It had taken on some kind of gravity, sucking me toward it with increasingly irresistible force. Flail and contort as I might, I couldn’t escape its gravity well as I was sucked closer and closer to the event horizon of its four walls. \n\nThere was no avoiding it.\n\nI closed my eyes and gritted my teeth. There was a deafening SCHLUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP, a sound so massive and unusual that onomatopoeia really fails to do it justice. I guess you just had to be there.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nWhen I opened my eyes I was lying on my back in a small symmetrical room.\n\nI looked around me. The furniture was austere and low-poly, just a bed and a dresser and a Fleetwood Mac calendar on the wall.

        "text": "I don't know what else to do about this, and I can’t sleep \n\nA year ago, I touched something in my backyard late at night. I felt that there was something back there the past few days, as if something was calling me, but I had been too scared to check it out. Well, on this night, I told myself I wasn’t going to let that fear stop me, because I had had a rough day and this was my way if trying to prove myself weird as that may sound. \n\nWhen I mustered up the courage to face whatever was back there, I’m not exactly sure what it was that I saw. It was dark, around midnight, and it was raining, which didn’t help. There was this black mist that was everywhere. I could see vague outlines of shapes in the mist. As ridiculous as it sounds, I felt I was communicating telepathically with these “shapes.” \n\nI can’t seem to remember these conversations for some reason, but, next thing you know I'm having all kind of weird sensations in my body, and I remember I even had my pants down at one point. I also remember hearing whispers in a foreign language, but I’m not sure which. I remember running in place for a good 15 minutes because I was trying to prove myself to these shapes / evil spirits. I didn’t think they were evil at the time, I thought of them as my friend, but I was sorely mistaken, and incredibly naïve to think they could do no harm to me. They also made me eat pork, which is unclean food by religious standards.\n\nAfter a long night, I woke up feeling. . . . strange. I kept having these thoughts of ending the world, and I just didn’t quite feel like myself. I still don’t feel like myself after that night.\n\nNow, I'm pretty sure I'm possessed . Whenever I think about the event, my legs go numb, and I can feel sensations/ numbness moving up and down my legs. I also have intrusive thoughts, thoughts that just don’t sound like me. Sometimes it feels like there’s two people inside me and I can’t tell how the thought applies to me or the both of “us,” whoever “us” is. The worst part is that I don't feel like myself at all.. I was also very high on THC when this happened, by the way.\n\n After a year of my life going downhill, I think I’ve been cursed because bad stuff keeps happening to me. I lost my car, nearly all my clothes and can’t seem to find a job. Now, I'm here asking for help because I don\\t know where else to go. I would be open to an exorcism at this point, but I’m not sure how to find one.  Please if there's anybody out there that has any idea what to do, let me know. Thank you for reading. Also I’m not the best story teller so if you want more details don’t hesitate to ask.",

        "text": "As I drove home from work in the middle of the night, a crying woman covered in blood came running out of the forest. I saw her only milliseconds before she left the thick grove of trees on my right. Her eyes were wide and uncomprehending, her mouth open in a perpetual shriek, her clothes torn into rags- but otherwise, she was beautiful and young. I saw only the merest glimpse of a slender white leg before I instinctively turned the steering wheel all the way to the left, trying not to hit her.\n\nAt the speed I was going, and with the constant rain falling down from the sky, I quickly lost control of the car. I missed her by mere inches as I swerved into the oncoming lane where, thankfully, no cars were coming. In slow motion, I saw the road pass by and then start to rise up to meet me as the car began to flip. I felt like I was in the air for minutes, but in reality it was likely only fractions of a second. Then the car landed, the black pavement rushing up to meet me, and my vision turned to blackness.\n\nI woke up suddenly in a white room, the walls seeming to be made of high-intensity LED lights. They were so bright and white that it almost hurt to look at them. I squinted my eyes slightly, and they slowly began to adjust to the overwhelming white light surrounding me. I stood up and looked around, rising off of a bed made of the same kind of light.\n\n“Where am I?” I asked. No one answered. I began to walk forward, and a building began to materialize around me suddenly, the white light all draining out of the bottom of the room like water running down a drain. I was in a castle, in the entryway looking out massive black gated doors. I looked behind me and saw the bed was just a bench with flat pillows inscribed with roses and cherubs. The castle seemed to stretch forever in a straight line, hallways with endless mahogany doors disappearing into a point in the horizon. No one moved in the rooms or the hallway. Outside, birds chirped pleasantly, and a tropical, sweet-smelling breeze blew past me.\n\nI turned my attention back to the front gate, deciding to go outside. As soon as I stepped outside the shade of the castle, a blazing sun warmed me. I instinctively put my arm above my eyes to dim the summer light. \n\nAs my pupils constricted and I was able to see better, I realized that the light overhead was not coming from a sun, but many eyes looking down at me from the sky. They all sent out some light of their own, brighter than a full moon but far dimmer than the actual sun. I could look up at them and see them moving around, their pupils dilating and constricting as each eye focused on something new. They stayed in constant motion, and there were thousands of them, covering the sky with white sclera, gray, purple and green irises, and constantly flicking pupils as far as my eye could see.\n\n“Those are the eyes of God,” a voice behind me said. I turned and saw a beautiful woman there, holding out her hands towards me. She had green eyes that shone like emeralds and a sweet, melodic voice that instantly calmed me. “You are in Heaven. You did it, you beautiful child.” She came over and put a hand on my cheek. It burned with her touch, sending waves of happiness through my body. As I looked closer at her, I realized she had on platinum armor and a scabbard, with an obsidian sword handle sticking out of the top. Tiny diamonds and emeralds decorated both the scabbard and the handle.\n\n“This isn’t like I imagined Heaven to be,” I said, looking at the trees all around us. They were covered in silver and gold, rising up hundreds of feet in the sky. They stood like skyscrapers, swaying slightly to and fro as the tropical breeze blew the smell of fruits and ocean through the air. At the top, I saw what looked like people moving around, flying even, but they were so high up I could barely make them out even when I squinted.\n\n“Well, the truth is,” she said, her smile widening from ear to ear, showing dozens of sharpened, blood-soaked teeth, her voice deepening and turning into a hissing gurgle, “God killed himself to make this world and your world and everything in-between.” She brought her other hand up, and now the waves of pleasure I had felt were replaced with burning pain as she scratched me with huge talons that had suddenly exploded out of her fingers. Her skin began to blacken, but the eyes stayed green, expanding into circles of luminous viridescent light between folds of black, rotted skin. Massive black wings unfurled behind her, squirming with millions of maggots that constantly fell to the ground, writhing as they tried to return home. The smell of the wings made me gag- reminding me of a combination of burning rubber and rotting roadkill.\n\nI screamed, clutching my cheek and feeling blood running down it in rivulets. I turned, running away from this monster as fast as I could. The eyes above me seemed to move faster, as if they had been agitated.\n\nAt that moment, four people rushed from the forest waving swords and crossbows. They barely seemed to notice me, focusing entirely on the female shapeshifter behind me. She hissed at them like a snake, sending her long, forked tongue flicking out of her mouth and pulling her glowing sword from its scabbard. With a battle cry that made my ears ring, she rushed forward, slicing off the head of the man in front. I saw it fly across the air in slow motion, the man’s body falling to its knees. He still had a look of surprise in his eyes when his head landed a few feet to the left of his body on the tropical white sands of the ground.\n\nThe others wasted no time, using the female’s distraction with the front sword-wielding man to attack her ferociously. One shot her directly in the neck with a crossbow, the bolt piercing through and reminding me ludicrously of the bolts on the neck of Frankenstein’s monster. She screamed with rage and pain as another rushed her from the left, swinging a massive broadsword at her jaw. Time seemed to slow down as the sword connected, cutting through the skin of the monster easily. As it penetrated deeper, sickly green light began to shoot out the wound, and by the time he had fully decapitated her, the light was so blinding I could no longer look.  \n\n“We have to go!” a woman screamed, pointing up to the tops of the massive trees. Looking up, I saw dozens of flying specks, looking like an agitated hornet’s nest as they regrouped and began to approach. As I squinted my eyes, I realized they were more of the black-skinned monstrosities, coming to the aid of the one this group of humans had just killed. I doubted whether they would be able to help her, as one glance at her body showed me her head hung on only by the spine and the associated ligaments and flesh in the back of the neck. She didn’t move anymore and the sickening green light had all evaporated. The maggots still swarmed, however, and voraciously began to move from the wings to the rest of the body.\n\nThe woman grabbed my arm, forcing me to run into the forest with her. The rest of the group was ahead of us. I heard the shrill battle cry of the flying monsters landing behind us, but the woods were growing thicker and the constant sharp turns of the leading members of our group would make it harder to find us.\n\nAfter a couple minutes of running, the shrieking and screaming falling further and further behind us, the man in front stopped suddenly. He opened up a camouflaged tunnel, pushing aside some of the silver leaves that covered the top of it. The rest of the group jumped down, then the man gestured for me to jump down. The fall was only a few feet, and I realized there were torches burning in a cramped tunnel. I walked forward, hearing the man close the door and land just behind me, pushing me forward. \n\nWe quickly came to a round room with a massive long table down the middle of it. Dozens of swords, crossbows, daggers and tridents covered it, all seeming to glow with their own soft, silver light. At the nearest end, the table was cleared and chairs were set up around a steaming pot. A chubby man ladled out bowls of delicious-smelling stew, smelling of mint, rosemary, potatoes and beef. He motioned for us to come sit down and eat. I hadn’t realized it until then, but I was absolutely ravenous.\n\nThey introduced themselves, and we sat down to eat. They poured delicious-smelling wines from crystal pitchers, and I ate the beef stew and drank red wine as they told me everything.\n\n“This is Heaven,” the chubby man said, sitting down on the bench across from me and pouring himself a glass of the wine. “Or at least, it used to be. It isn’t Heaven like most people think of it anymore. Remember, I don’t know all of this absolutely, but I’ve heard most of it from the angels and others who have been here a long time, so at least most of it is true.”\n\n“You mean that shape-shifting monster…” I began. He nodded.\n\n“Those are the angels. They have become rabid and evil over the last few billion years. But I’m getting ahead of myself.\n\n“Nearly 14 billion years ago, God killed himself to create the universe. He cut himself open and let eternal amounts of mass, energy and consciousness pour out of his body, an action which became known to us as the Big Bang. All of this matter had nowhere to go within God’s body, so it created our universe instead.\n\n“Now God dying isn’t like you or me dying, you understand. God dies very, very slowly. It is like he has been bleeding out this entire time, but now he is truly close to death. In our universe’s time, maybe another 1,000 years at most and he will be gone. Once he goes, the entire universe as we know it will go too. It will instantly turn into blackness once the light of his consciousness no longer lights the stars and worlds of our universe.\n\n“These angels here, they got an idea that if they fed the human souls in Heaven to God’s mouth, he would live slightly longer. And it seems to be working- every time they feed him a few thousand souls, he seems to heal slightly. But he is still dying. At most they might delay the end by a few centuries, but even that seems doubtful.” The man shook his face, his jowls shaking slightly. “You can’t really die in Heaven, as even if you get your head cut off, it will grow back after a couple hours. But if they feed you to God’s mouth, then you do, in essence, die. Your consciousness is digested by God and it is fed throughout his body, dissipating into the eternity within him.”\n\n“Where is God’s mouth?” I asked, and all the people in the room looked at each other, a sour expression on their faces.\n\n“It is at the end of Heaven,” the chubby man said, his eyes downcast. “It is… a horrible thing to behold. Trillions of gnashing teeth, endless insects infesting it and screaming in unison. Since his body began to fall apart, the insects of Heaven have really begun to consume His flesh… I think it is driving God insane. A lot of the terrible things in our world might be arising from his insanity and dying- the World Wars, the death camps, the mass killings by Communists. But that is just speculation, I don’t know that for sure.”\n\nAt that moment, I heard a loud crash outside. Shouts and running from above us made everyone deathly silent. Then the hidden trapdoor leading down here was flung open and angels began pouring down the opening, carrying glowing swords and crossbows. They instantly attacked, dozens more coming from behind them. They slashed at the chef. He absurdly raised his wine glass in front of him as if that would stop the sword flying down towards his skull, but instead it cleaved his face in two, and he fell backwards. Within seconds everyone except me was moaning, dead or dying, on the ground. I instinctively picked up my wooden bowl, spilling stew all over myself and the floor. \n\nThe angels began to pull the hacked-up bodies of the others they had murdered out, then approached me, their dead, black eyes staring daggers at me as I backed against the dirt wall of the hidden shelter.\n\nJust as they had all surrounded me, and one was raising his sword to cut me open, I began hearing sounds that didn’t fit.\n\n“Clear!”\n\n“Again!”\n\n“He’s waking up!”\n\nAs the sword came down towards my face, I suddenly opened my eyes, my other eyes, feeling the cold, damp pavement beneath my body. I looked around and saw myself surrounded by paramedics, a Lifestar helicopter loudly descending a hundred feet further down the road. I saw the naked woman who had run out in front of my car in the back of an ambulance. I looked down and saw the wooden bowl in my hands still, cleaved in two by a sword, remnants of herbs and sauce still clinging to the inside of it. Then I closed my eyes and fell back asleep.\n\nThe doctors at the hospital told me I had been clinically dead for five minutes. Apparently the woman I had almost hit was the latest victim of a serial killer. She had escaped from him and ran blindly into the road out of mortal terror. I didn’t blame her in the least, and was simply glad I hadn’t hit her.\n\nI still have the wooden bowl I brought back with me, and the slices on my cheek from that thing I encountered. Once I get out of here, I want to send the remnants of the bowl to a scientific institute, to see what it is truly made out of. I have a feeling it is not a kind of wood anyone on Earth has ever seen before.\n\nThe vision of Heaven I had received was the most disturbing thing of the entire experience. It truly changed my life, and not for the better.\n\nI wasn’t afraid of dying before. But I certainly am now.",

The patient relays that he is seeing his deceased mother follow him everywhere, and if he should sleep, he says she will bring harm to him. \n\nHistory of Present Illness: The patient has been receiving services under the care of Dr. Sophia Kim for the past twenty years. From my review of his documented sessions with Dr. Kim, Mr. Wilson sought out her services when he was 18 years old due to stress at home with his mother. From the records, Mr. Wilson’s mother was experiencing a similar psychosis, hallucinating that her deceased husband was trying to harm her. Mr. Wilson’s father also unfortunately committed suicide about 20 years ago, of which his mother witnessed. It seems that her fragile mental state deteriorated, and Mr. Wilson was seeking treatment for coping with both his loss of his father and his mother’s condition. Mr. Wilson, while attempting to care for his mother during her many hospitalizations and treatments, also struggled with caring for his daughter and maintaining expectations of work. Thus begins the initiating of our services.\n\nPsychiatric History: The patient has never been hospitalized for psychiatric purposes. Outside of his therapy services, his only treatment has been at this facility. It appears that Mr. Wilson was prescribed Xanax for anxiety management a few months ago, which he states he has never utilized. After the death of his mother, and his mental state understandably deteriorated, Prozac was also added to his medication regimen. Pt also reports refusal of this medication.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSubstance Abuse History: \n\nCaffeine - Daily cup of coffee, occasional soda\n\nAlcohol - Social use exclusively\n\nTobacco - Current everyday smoker. We discussed the major consequences of tobacco, and encouraged tobacco cessation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbuse History/Trauma/Unusual Childhood Events: Alarmingly, it appears that Mr. Wilson’s condition is recurrent in his family. Mr. Wilson’s father had hallucinations that his estranged brother (pt’s uncle) was going to “drown him”, of which was triggered by his brother’s suicide a year prior. Mr. Wilson reports that his mother attempted to get his father psychiatric help multiple times throughout his childhood, but tragically, walked in on her deceased husband, drowned in the bathtub. Shortly after, Mr. Wilson’s mother experienced the same hallucinations, stating her husband was going to suffocate her. Mr. Wilson stated that while it’s reported that his mother committed suicide by hanging 6 months ago, his inquiry of an autopsy suggested she had traumatic bruises on her wrists, arms, and neck that could not be self-inflicted. Mr. Wilson does, in some part, believe his deceased father murdered his mother…\n\nFamily Psychiatric History: Prior to any witnessed suicides/suicide attempts, there is no documented psychiatric history for Mr. Wilson’s family. Mr. Wilson himself stated that prior to his uncle’s suicide, his family had no psychiatric complications or issues.\n\nSocial History: Mr. Wilson maintained consistent employment as an environmental scientist with the Department of Natural Resources. He is divorced as of five years ago. He has a single daughter, 14 years old. However, Mr. Wilson relayed that he caused the two of them to become estranged, “for her own good”. Under inquiry, Mr. Wilson tearfully said “I cannot bear the thought of haunting her” and would not divulge under further questioning.\n\nMental Status Examination: The patient is alert, cooperative, yet highly anxious. He is disheveled and unkempt. He appears exhausted, and from my review, is refusing to sleep due to fear of harm from his hallucinations. He avoids eye contact, fixating on the corner of his room. His speech and intelligence are above average, goal-directed, coherent, although hurried and strenuous. Mood is fearful, and affect is anxious. The patient becomes more anxious with some of the questions during the assessment, stating “My mother wants to kill me… My father killed her… My uncle killed him, I know it…”\n\nPrognosis and Plan of Care: Mr. Wilson is a discomforting case. I cannot discern his cognition nor a diagnosis at this time. His hallucinations are very real to him, and apparently his whole family. Aiding in his mental status would require intensive and long term treatment. As his previous family’s history was unable to be resolved, we will have to consider alternative treatments for his severe psychosis. For his own safety, sedation and transfer to a higher level of care is imperative.\n\nMyself and my team will be rounding on Mr. Wilson frequently. Should any changes be made to his condition, please do not hesitate to reach out with concerns or questions.\n\n**Signed by MD, Chen, William on 11/02/XX at 1755.**\n\n\\--\n\n*Nursing Note entered by BROWN, ISABELLA on 11/03/XX at 0247.*\n\nUpon pt rounds, found patient to be standing at bedside, staring at the corner of the room. Attempted to assist patient back into bed. Pt stated “I know you think I’m confused or out of my mind, but I’m not. I see her quite clearly, and I know she’s going to hurt me. I need you to help me… I can’t stay awake much longer.” This RN relayed that she was trying to help the patient, and stating she would give him some medication to help him sleep. Pt then became angry, stating “I don’t need medications, she is haunting me! I need someone who believes what I’m saying! If I sleep, she will kill me! Why won’t you understand?” Pt then became combative, attempting to leave the facility.\n\nThis RN, Charge RN, and PCT placed pt in bed. IV ativan administered for pt agitation. Pt sleeping soundly at this time, will continue to monitor.\n\n\\--\n\n*Nursing Note entered by BROWN, ISABELLA on 11/03/XX at 0342.*\n\nCode Blue initiated. Pt found covered in blood, appears to be eviscerated. MD on call notified.\n\n\\--\n\n*Declaration of Death Note entered by ANDERSON, LIAM on 11/03/XX at 0402.*\n\nPatient WILSON, JAMES in room 402 pronounced deceased on November 3rd, XXXX at 0400 by Dr. LIAM ANDERSON. Patient deceased due to evisceration of bowels, cause unknown, possibly related to admitting diagnosis of psychosis. No heart sounds were auscultated, pupils were mid-dilated and fixed. No breath sounds were appreciated over either lung field. No carotid pulses were palpable. Time of death confirmed and witnessed by Nurse ISABELLA.\n\nNo family present at bedside. MD attempted contact with ex-wife Rebecca at 0358 with no response.\n\nPatient body prepared for autopsy due to abnormal circumstances of death. Awaiting transportation arrival at this time.",

        "text": "Home sweet home. A place of sanctuary. Your own little slice of paradise. I never put much thought into it until recently. How much emphasis we as people place on our homes. Some refer to it as their castle, a place where they above all else rule. Others leave it up to the heart to decide. To find that one place that feels like home above all titles and logical reason. To some, this is a place imbued with nostalgia, and to others, it is nothing more than a foreign environment that somehow feels utterly familiar. Ultimately home is wherever we decide it to be.\n\nHome as a concept, or an idea, was not something I ever put much thought towards. That is not to say I never felt the joyous comfort it can provide, or longed for a day never-ending to cease upon my arrival back through its familiar door. No, those are feelings like many I am no stranger to. However, the idea of it being anything more than simply a place for me to rest my head and live out my days would take many years to dawn. When I was a child, my home was a place for me to rest, eat, play, and little else. It consisted of family and the occasional friend or pet. It was nothing special, but It was mine, and for many years, it would be my world. When something is all you know, and you hold no reason to question it, rarely, at least in my experience, do you.\n\nAge is a brutal thing however, the thoughts in which we placed very little focus, now become the center of our worlds. Gone are the days of endless imagination which turned backyards into kingdoms and attics into spaceships exploring the endless expanse of our universe. Life's cruelest joke is the pain of age. Imagination, instead of fading, is replaced with the harsh truths of reality. Time and responsibilities eat away at any hope still lingering in our heads, and being whisked off into lands unknown once again soon falls by the wayside.\n\nTo say that so far I have lived a grand life would be nothing short of a lie. I was never the greatest at anything. My abilities helped me remain dead center in the middle of the pack. Unwanted eyes were never cast my way for repeated failure, or for adolescent outbursts in a desperate hope of gaining attention, I failed to find elsewhere. In truth, I was nothing more than average and painfully content with it. As a child, my greatest gift like so many was the sheer willpower of my imagination. This did little to change my lot in life. The one that I intentionally fell into for whatever reasons I deemed worthwhile throughout the stages of my early life. Overall I’ll admit it was quite easy living carelessly with a mindset like that. All I ever had to do was place one foot in front of the other and allow life like some cosmic force to guide me forward.\n\nAs the years persisted much like they do my eyes would open more to the world around me. It would take time for me to realize the detrimental toll this took on my imagination, the one gift I was granted. Imagination is a unique gift. Each of us is granted it from birth. The ability to be whisked away into whatever daydreamed illusion we find ourselves called to. The true gift that comes with it is the strength to maintain it. To never let your grasp upon its intangible surface falter. I believe now more than ever that if one is able to do so, if you can prevent yourself from letting your eyes wander too far, you’ll have something very few are able to keep ahold of and its power is limitless. By the time I had reached the doorstep of higher education mine had almost entirely vanished. I don’t blame the parties, the drinking, the girls I chased, the friends I smoked my first cigarette with behind the bleachers, the family vacations, nights spent alone playing games or watching movies, or the part-time job I put so many hours into. I blame nothing more than myself. Life and the experiences held within can serve as great fuel for the machine that is our mind. I blame myself for losing focus. For allowing those things to eat away at my imagination rather than power it. In a way, a mind must be trained to truly harness that which we are all given. As I said I wouldn’t realize this for quite some time. Despite my withering gift as years passed on a dream grew inside of me. The dream was simple. I wanted to be different. To discard my identity as average and become something more.\n\nI had little artistic ability. Music was out of my grasp as was drawing or painting. I knew nothing of film or photography yet more and more I felt drawn to this idea of separating myself from the herd. I did not know at the time what I wished to share with the world. What it was that would make me stand out. There was no all-consuming idea I felt determined to present. All I knew is I wanted more than what I had accepted as my life. After taking a long look at myself and my lackluster abilities, I decided to tell the world a story. Eighteen years old and hopeful, I figured pursuing an English degree would be my best option. With that one decision, my mind was made up. I would study the language and become an author.\n\nI wish I could say I spent the next four years of my life faithfully devoted to my task. Unfortunately, that would be a lie. I did try in the beginning. As sad of an attempt as it might have been. After getting settled my work began. I had barely anything resembling an idea but still, I began work on my first novel. For a few weeks between studying, I did little more than write. I was alone and had nothing else to distract myself with. Unfortunately for my dream I soon made friends, which led to parties, and hangouts, sneaking into clubs and bars, and late nights hanging out in our dorm rooms as we let the world fade away in puffs of smoke. Time would pass and my grades would slip calling for more of my attention to be divided. Before long I’d meet more people, go on dates, and eventually find love. I know now that had I told her I needed a few hours even just once a week she would have understood, but back then I thought differently. Maybe that’s a lie too. Maybe writing, pursuing my dream, was more frustrating than I had expected, and she was a beautiful reason to procrastinate. Nevertheless, those four years soon slipped past me in a blur. There were times where I still made an attempt as few and far between as they were. Times where I figured it’d be best to start over. Times where I completely gave up. Times where the paycheck from whatever diner, bar, construction site, clothes store, or janitorial position felt far more persuading than spending another penniless night frustrated before the dim glow of my laptop.\n\nWithout much thought, I succumbed to the shuffles of life. After graduation writing was truly little more than a dream. Something thought about vaguely in the late hours of the night. I won’t bore you with more of my excuses but life moved on and I along with it. Unable to escape. In a way I enjoyed life wrapped up in the comfortable delusions brought by the false promises I continued to whisper to myself. Words said only to me. Words about “someday” and “when I find the time” all the while knowing deep down that those words held no real truth. I remained lost in this delusion for quite some while, but never entirely, as the quiet ticks of time never seemed to fall on deaf ears. It was those very ticks on the irreversible clock of life that would inevitably drag me under. While it was fun I could only bear the total lack of forward momentum for so long before depression found me. This depression would ultimately prove to be my salvation but it was one that would take months to move me.\n\nThe idea was born in the back of my mind. Something that came and went when it pleased and never drew much attention. However, its constant resurfacing in the depths of my mind would be my ticket to the life I always wished for. After much time I hatched a plan. It wasn’t amazing or glamorous. If anything it was very simple. I decided on a new life. A fresh start of sorts. Something that would forever reawaken all that I had lost. I saved every penny I could and eventually managed to afford first and last for a small one-bedroom in a new city. I packed my bags, said goodbye to my dead-end job, and left my old home. In a single breath, air filled my lungs for the first time in years. I won’t deny it honestly felt amazing.\n\nMy new home was nothing special that was evident for all to see. However it was mine, and for the first time, a certain part of me relished in that. For once I was all on my own, and be it a castle or a dump, I had earned one thing I failed to taste prior. True freedom. Not belonging to anyone but myself. I was isolated and determined to pursue my dream. When it was finally accomplished I would share stories of my humble beginnings starting out in an apartment even the rats avoided. The place was permanently stained through years of cigarette smoke. The ceiling, once likely white, had been tainted with a yellow hue. The scent hovered through the air having been fused into the very walls and floor. Carpet remained stained with a variety of browns and blacks and grays. Every room was decorated in cheap wallpaper, its pattern brought to mind flowers but wasn’t exactly that. The building itself was no better. It shrieked silently to all who found themselves within its shadow. Lost in thought I’d watch as passersby were caught, unable to avert their gaze from the hideous behemoth before them. It haunted the very street mocking the white picket fences which surrounded it through its dirt and grime. The unkempt lawn served as no place for garden gnomes and patio stones. Each chipped brick a true testament to days long since passed and renovations which failed to reach its doorstep.\n\nMy first night there while boxes waited ready to be unpacked I sat down on the couch left by a previous owner and started my work anew. I promised myself that this would be it. That my goal would finally be obtained no matter what hardships I had to endure. I found the first job I could within a week. It was a cute little bookstore run by an old man. I thought if I were to be a writer where better to work than where all the greats had left their work on display. Those first few weeks were truly amazing and I was able to discover a sense of joy in writing I had never found prior. It was the sort of fulfillment that continually eluded me in all aspects of life until that very moment. Be it the nights I spent all alone in that apartment or the few days off I was granted my every moment was filled with my fingers dancing across a keyboard. Though I would soon learn a dead imagination was hard to revive. At first, I took any idea I could think of and soon they slowly gave way to the slightest inklings of stories. Few made it further than a page, many died in just a single sentence. I remained hopeful early on, but try as I might my brain failed to translate my thoughts into anything feasible.\n\nAgain time passed and I had accomplished nothing. When ideas did form something practical I beat myself for my lackluster abilities. When they failed to take shape I tortured myself endlessly for my lack of creativity. Eventually, after seasons shifted, I found myself convinced that it would never come to me if I forced it. I told myself that breaks were just as important as work itself.\n\nThat if I truly had a story to tell to the world it would come to me in time. I was tired of the frustration. Tired of all the self-doubt and the endless hits to both my confidence and self-worth. No matter what, every Idea I pursued was met with a dead end, and I would begin anew each time slightly more disheartened than the last. The excitement I once held for writing had almost vanished and the dream of a life distinguished began to corrode.\n\nDiscouraged beyond all belief, I let my laptop collect dust as each night gave way to an endless series of tv and games. I distinctly remember convincing myself that this would aid me in the long run. That what I was really doing was seeking out inspiration. I wish that was true, but when Ideas came I never stirred, I wanted them to “cook” longer. As another season changed I could no longer deny the truth. My dream would forever elude me. I wanted to blame everything but I was truly the only problem. Night was when I was haunted the most. Without end, I would linger on how little I had accomplished in my thirty years on this planet as once more I watched my life slip past me. My last thought before sleep would take me every night was a wish. I wished for inspiration to find me. For the very universe to grant me my story. This wish would be granted sooner than I realized.\n\nWinter had made its arrival clear this year, and my little home began to wither ever so slightly. Windows became permanently frosted over and pipes groaned almost endlessly throughout the night while faucets dripped cold droplets. Beneath the smell of cigarettes hung the ever-distinct aroma of rot. In a way, it sort of smelt like a combination of expired food and decaying wood. At times it even reminded me of sour milk. On other occasions, it bore the oddest resemblance to pickled eggs. Ultimately I could never quite place what it was that I smelt throughout my home. It was too inconsistent. Both in its strange odor and the frequency in which it appeared. That putrid aroma would arrive so suddenly and then vanish without a trace. All attempts, in the beginning, did little to determine its source.\n\nAll around my apartment, upon every paper-coated wall, little changes began to form. Little gifts left behind bearing more and more signs of the growing change within my home. It was hardly noticeable in the beginning. The kind of thing your subconscious takes note of but fails to reach that aware and alert part of your brain, the part that takes note and makes sure you remember as your mind sifts through all the thoughts brought forward. I’m positive I noticed it early on, but I can’t remember when that was. I also no longer remember if it occurred before or after that smell began. Or even if they began in tandem with one another. What I do know now is that their existence was tied. I never could have suspected so at the time. There is very little reason to connect the dots between the smell I found suffocating me at odd hours of the day and the hardly noticeable peeling of my wallpaper.\n\nIt was so unremarkable when it first began. Nothing more than a few ripped edges along the top or bottom of an odd wall. It didn’t matter if it was the kitchen, the living room, the hall, or my bedroom. It was barely worth a glance in the beginning let alone a thought, but I am sure I noticed it back then. For the life of me, I can’t remember if that’s when I first smelt it. I wonder if the smell came first or if it only arrived after things left the realm of the unexceptional. What I do know for a fact is that when I walked through my home to discover long strands dangling down from the top of the wall and torn off from its base, I was already well aware of that horrid scent. As days passed they appeared more often, scattered throughout my apartment at intervals that caused me to simply stand and ponder as to why this might be occurring. In the beginning, I could never find a reason and even now I still have so many questions. In the morning every now and again I’d find a few long strands collected just beneath the wall in a neat little pile. Above would be the tear marks. The spot where they once clung to now free of the once dangling pieces of paper. As winter continued to press forward these events only continued to grow. Until one particularly cold morning, one where the wind howled and roared and the world outside had been blurred by snowfall, I would finally make an important discovery.\n\nWhen I awoke that morning there it was, staring right at me. It gave me no time to stumble upon it or to slowly build as my mind was occupied by the other happenings. The moment I opened my eyes it stood there across from me as if taunting me. I saw five neat strands of wallpaper hanging from my wall. They were small as if scratched into a peel, and each bent of themselves like they were asking to be pulled down. When I rose to my feet they met the bottom of my throat. In all my time I had not once touched them while they remained on the wall, and until that day they remained as frayed edges along the top or bottom of the wall. On that morning the second statement changed and soon the first would as well.\n\nWith my curiosity roused, I inspected the peculiarity before me. There was something in how different it was that truly aroused my curiosity. The tops of the strands didn’t appear chipped or clawed at, if anything it almost looked like they were pushed from the inside of the wall. Like something had ever so slightly pushed the tips of its fingers through the wallpaper until just enough of it had fallen down for me to grab onto. I did exactly that and pulled the first of the strands away. It ran for a few inches before thinning and then tearing off from the wall. Behind it lay nothing more than the same glimpse into the freshly exposed wall I’d already seen through the rest of my apartment. I don’t know what I had been hoping to find but I felt the smallest tinge of disappointment. My curiosity had not been satisfied and so I repeated the process grabbing hold of the next strand down the line. Once more I tugged down on it until it could no longer remain attached to the wall. It ripped gently, tickling my ears as it moved.\n\nAgain I’m not sure what it was I noticed first. I remember coughing when it hit me though. Cowering away and burying my nose and mouth into my sleeve. It was less like a small gut punch and more like an assault on my entire system. The unmistakable feeling of vomit, rising up and burning my throat, was hard to ignore as I recoiled. After a few groans, I was able to push back against the feeling. Up until that moment I had never encountered a smell that could make my eyes water or sting with such ferocity. With my fist pressed against my mouth and nostrils, I looked back up as I used all my willpower to avoid gagging and picked up where I had left off. There was no mistaking it, through my curiosity, I had seemingly found the source of the smell. Hidden behind the remaining pieces of wallpaper it laid dormant, my eyes only able to see the edge which peeked out from behind the paper. What I saw was nothing more than a small hole.\n\nunapologetically silent and eerily dark it sat there barely exposed. With a hand covering the lower half of my face, I continued to remove the remaining strands one by one. The smell remained as repulsive as ever as I rid the wall of the remaining strands of paper. It seemed to reach its putrid peak the moment it was revealed and proved to linger, never fading or dulling in the time to come. Once I had removed all the wallpaper, all that remained was the hole. Barely any bigger than a quarter. It was peculiar, to say the least. It appeared as if the wall naturally curved inwards with it. Bending inside of itself through the piercing. As if it had been placed there by design. Even with the smell still hanging in the air, I couldn't stop myself from running my thumb along it. It was smooth to the touch. Not a single misshapen or jagged edge upon it. Perfectly round. Perfectly cut. Perfectly smooth. Even the smoke-stained primer which I had revealed followed the fold into the wall.\n\nMy curiosity had been satisfied in some aspects. I had found something after all, although the question of what I had found still remained, more importantly, I wanted to find what was creating that smell. I pulled back from the wall, no longer able to bear the scent of the hole a moment longer, and left the room. I entered my bathroom and squirted some toothpaste onto my finger and applied it to the skin just below my nose. After that, I entered my living room and found a mask and a small flashlight. Once it was slapped onto my face I returned to my room.\n\nThe smell was still nauseating in a sense, but I was able to withstand it far more than I could previously and so I approached the hole. Placing one hand on the wall beside it I leaned in closing an eye as I did so. What I saw inside the hole was an absence of anything at all. Although I suppose that isn’t entirely correct. I did see something. Before my eyes was a never-ending all encompassing darkness where not even a hint of light shown. The smell overpowered my defenses and I pulled back coughing and gagging. Stepping away I noticed the shadows cast throughout my room reaching out across every wall and sparse bit of furniture. My once bright room had dimmed almost considerably. Like the very sun had moved in the brief moment.  Once the feeling of nausea had subsided I turned back to the hole flicking on the flashlight as I did so.\n\nA spotlight was cast before me illuminating the area around the hole in a perfect circle. The wall shined back at me in a grotesque shade of yellow but to my surprise, the hole seemed unaffected by the beam of light. It simply vanished upon contact. As if the darkness had been sucked in and absorbed leaving no trace behind. In truth, it was repulsively dark. I was bewildered at what I saw and for only a moment I wondered if I had been mistaken somehow, that maybe what I thought was a hole was merely just a splash of black paint. I knew however this couldn’t be true. I touched it. Felt its curves. Gazed into its infinite darkness with my own eye, and most importantly I had been tortured via its stench. Regardless, despite all my reasons to the contrary, I couldn’t stop myself from touching it once more. To prove what I saw was real. As I touched it again ever so slightly the tip of my thumb slipped inside it. I jolted back in an instant. It felt like I had just had my thumb frozen in a block of ice. It was freezing cold. I cupped it and winced from the temperature difference. No cold air had flowed out of the hole itself but the inside of it was impossibly cold.\n\nMore perplexed than ever I leaned towards the hole cupping the side of my face with my free hand. I brought the light in as close as I could and stared into the hole. Still, I saw nothing. I should have been able to spy studs and insulation, or wires and rusted pipes, I would have even found it less bizarre to gaze into the apartment next to mine. The light did nothing to breach the darkness. I stayed there for a minute trying my best to make out something, anything at all. As I gazed into the hole of vanishing light and everlasting darkness I could feel the world around me slowly slip away. All sounds remained unheard. All distractions were discarded. I stood frozen in time waiting for my eyes to adjust, so I could make out something in the dark. But nothing was ever seen.\n\nThe smell hit me like a title wave out of nowhere and I jumped back from the wall. This time the room around me was almost as dark as the hole itself. Behind the ever-raging snowstorm just past my window glowed soft street lights. In my right hand remained the flashlight. Its beam had long since been extinguished. My eyes darted around the room in shock. Seemingly hours had passed as I gazed into the hole. I felt a cold shiver run down my spine and my stomach turned for reasons other than the smell in the air. I stumbled over to my phone pressing the power button. The glow burst forward, stinging my eyes slightly. Its screen displayed missed texts sent hours prior and two missed phone calls. Above all the notifications I saw the time. 8:53. I stumbled out of the room in what I can only describe as a daze entering the dark hallway with sweating palms. I remember muttering to myself as I mindlessly placed one foot ahead of the other. I don't know what it was I said but I’m sure it was a series of incomprehensible garbage. The ramblings of a man whose world was just thrown upside down.\n\nMy hands first hit my face then ran up through my hair as I fell to my knees. The scent wafted out from my room but for the first time, it was hard to focus on. Looking back I’d probably say my mind was empty, but I’m sure it was a whirlpool of thought. I sat releasing staggered breath after staggered breath for a while. Once the shaking stopped I pushed myself back up. More hesitant than ever I inched towards the bedroom. When I reached its edge, with a lowered gaze, I grabbed a hold of the doorknob and pulled it. The moment before it closed I couldn’t stop my eyes from shifting upward. The hole remained as dark as ever. My next decision might not have been rational but all the same, my hand slipped behind the door and twisted the lock before I finally shut it.\n\nThe smell still crept out through the crack beneath the door but closing it had reduced it if only slightly. With a deep breath, I turned my back on the room and walked towards my living room making sure to flick on the hall light as I passed its switch. My head felt light, my stomach serged with the pains of hunger, and my throat begged desperately for a glass of water. I heated some leftovers, poured myself a cup, and took a seat before the tv. Whatever I turned on fell into silence as my mind focused on only one thing. I wanted to be rid of that hole. I didn’t care what it was. I didn’t care what made that smell. Impossibly I had lost hours gazing into the unknown. Time I would never get back. Answers were worthless to me at that point. What had happened, all of it, shouldn’t have been possible. I thought about the hole for hours as I sat there on my couch and as the tv droned on I eventually was overtaken by the hands of sleep.\n\nThat night I dreamed of a voice calling out to me. My apartment was consumed by the same darkness that lived within the hole. It was thick like smoke but as scentless as fog. Like a fine vapor, the dark substance shifted through the air as I followed the voice. Soon I found myself back in my bedroom. Gone was the furniture, or any semblance that I had once inhabited the room. All that remained was the hole in the wall. It looked slightly bigger. Still perfectly circular but larger than I had left it. The black clouds which hovered above the floor throughout my home leaked out from within the hole. The voice, so seductive, begged me to stare into it one more time. It promised me so many things. All I had to do was take one last look and what I desired would be mine. With each step, the voice grew louder but it wasn’t coming from the hole. In truth, it had no real location at all. The voice was everywhere and nowhere all at once. The thought of rejecting its offer never crossed my mind and before I knew it I was bending over, placing my hands against the wall, and looking into its depth again.\n\nI awoke with a scream. The entirety of the dream still fresh in my mind, horribly vivid in every aspect other than its final moments. I had no recollection of what I saw, but whatever it was horrified me. I gasped for air desperately as I shot up and that's when the smell hit me and my room came into focus. The door was wide open and I did not lay beneath the warm sheets of my bed. I slowly looked behind me and saw the hole above my head. I wasted no time. I lept to my feet and bolted out of the room. Grabbing my keys and wallet I left my apartment behind and drove down to the nearest hardware store. After thirty minutes I found myself standing back in my apartment with all the necessary tools to get rid of the hole in my two hands.\n\nI didn’t have a single explanation for anything. The hole only confused me more and more after each interaction. There was not a single doubt in my mind that whatever I had found seemed to be impossible but deep down I wished for some form of logical explanation. With all rational aspects of my brain running on fumes, any clear answer stayed far out of reach. I dreaded looking at it again. Horrified at the prospect of losing more time and in all honesty despite the fact I knew what I had experienced the night prior was nothing more than a nightmare, it had left a horrible taste in my mouth. So standing there, with hours lost the day prior to a hole devoid of any light, I couldn’t help but question my own sanity. The truth is however even if whatever I was experiencing was all in my head I still wanted to be rid of it. I felt as though if I simply removed the hole then even if I was crazy it could no longer torment me. Or rather I could no longer torment myself with it.\n\nTightening my grip around my freshly purchased supplies I made my way toward the bedroom. As the door gently creaked open immediately I felt unnerved. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched. It felt as though a thousand eyes were cast upon me. With a single but deep breath, I pushed away the strange feelings and approached the hole in my wall.\n\nAlthough at bay my unease grew with every step forward. Carefully I set my tools down and looked toward the hole. I thought back to my dream and wondered what I could have seen within. Even with my fear and against my better judgment I decided to take one last look into it. Hoping with every fiber of my being that I was somehow mistaken the day prior. That there was some sort of explanation for whatever I was dealing with. So I turned my phone's flashlight on and peered into the hole for what I hoped would be the final time.\n\nIt greeted me with what I unfortunately expected. A vast all consuming darkness which no light could penetrate and no objects could be seen. With my sanity in question and my fears confirmed I pushed myself away from the wall. The moment I did dread overtook me. The kind of dread that reaches down to your very core. I knew at that moment without a doubt everything about the situation was instinctually wrong as my now dead phone weighed heavy in my hand. This time I looked only for a moment yet again when I pulled away my room was cast in darkness. I think tears welled up in my eyes as I stood there, the realization setting in. Those tears didn’t last long however as soon rage took hold.\n\nI made for the light switch and then for my tools. First I cut the mesh and applied it to the hole, then after that was done I applied the primer. It might sound dumb to say but I stood there and watched as it dried. I’d like to say I did it out of spite, for losing so much time already to the thing, and maybe that’s partially true, but the real reason I dared not move was out of fear. Fear for if I turned my back on it somehow it would be there once again. Hours passed and I remained until it was dry enough to sand. Once that was complete I pushed against the spot where it once stood half expecting my thumb to re-enter its cold depths, but the patch stood strong. With a weekend lost but thankful to be able to forget about whatever I had stumbled across, I decided to take a relaxing bath.\n\nI sank into the hot water, feeling every ounce of stress leave my body. I stayed there for well over an hour feeling all my stress melt away bit by bit. Feeling fresh I exited the bath, and with a towel around my waist moved into the living room. I had work the next day and too much time had been lost already. I could feel the sting of hunger back with a vengeance and my throat felt drier than a desert. I cooked myself some hot dogs. Cut fresh mold off of buns that had only been a few days old and took a seat on the couch. I was so thirsty I drank four cups of water, it was the most I had ever had in one sitting. I felt terribly exhausted and lay back on my couch. With my front door in full view, it was only then I noticed the blinking red light on my home phone. I got back up and approached the small device. My hand hovered above the play button while worry took hold. Hesitantly I pushed the button and the message began to play.\n\n“Hey Derrick this is Peter, it’s nine fifteen currently and I was just calling to see if you planned on showing up to work today. I know things can come up, so just call me back and let me know.”\n\nIt was my boss. There was a click and the next message began. He said the date and still as friendly as ever and asked where I was. Another message played and he repeated the date again, but it was different this time. It was two days later. Finally, the last message played.\n\n“I’m sorry to say but this is unacceptable. It’s been all week and I haven't heard a thing from you. I’ve tried calling your cell and nothing. I even stopped by your place but nobody was home. I got a business to run here and clearly, you’ve got other things going on, I’m gonna have to let you go Derrick.” The message ended abruptly after that.\n\nI felt the world around me start to spin. My knees buckled as my legs lost all strength. I felt sick. All of this was impossible. None of it made any sense. Almost hyperventilating I simply muttered the word how over and over again. My hands shook as my eyes drifted down the hall. In a steady flow, it gently glided inches above the floor. To my horror, it was the black vapor from my dream. Charging down the hall in a daze I burst through the door only to find my patch job menacingly absent. My supplies still sat on the floor beneath the hole, but the effects of my handiwork were nowhere to be seen. The black vapor oozed out from the depths of the small circular cut and clouded over my floor. It was back. In a fit of anger, I returned to my living room. Rustling through drawers, I tossed items to the side one by one until my hands wrapped around a small hammer. I was back in the room in an instant and wasting no time I brought the teeth of the hammer crashing down into the wall. It caught nicely and I pulled back with all my might as chunks of drywall burst out around me. I repeated this act again and again and again and again and again and again until more hole remained than wall. I could finally see studs and insulation everything I hoped for. Then I blinked.\n\nIn that brief instant of time, all the damage I had done was restored. That perfect circle that was the hole presented itself before me perfectly untouched. I snapped then. I decided I’d tear the whole wall down if that’s what it took. I crouched down just below the hole and swung the blunt end of the hammer into it. The drywall exploded on impact and fell beneath the cloud at my feet. I continued as bits of wall shot out towards me until finally there was a hole big enough for me to fit my body into. Sticking my head through the freshly exposed area I looked up and instead of darkness once more I saw all I wished to see. The normal innards of a wall. Oddly enough from down there, no hole could be seen. I pulled back then, bits of loose drywall breaking off on my shoulders. When I stood the smile that had made its way across my face was wiped away in a moment. The unaffected hole remained before me.\n\nI crouched back down and broke through the wall into the vacant apartment next to me. Crawling through, bits of draw wall, dust, and cobwebs clung to my body. The only thing on my mind at that point was the hole. I didn’t care about anything else. I simply wanted to be rid of whatever this thing was. Turning around I beat at the wall until hardly anything remained. After I was done, dripping with sweat, I should have guessed what I would see. From the other side of the wall, there was no hole at all. No darkness. Nothing more than what you’d expect to see when staring at the guts between two apartments. Bewildered, I returned to my own apartment back through the tunnel I had made and there it sat. Its eerie darkness showed nothing of what I had just done behind it.\n\nIt was then I screamed. Loud and without an ounce of care, until my voice was horse and dead. I stumbled backward feeling defeated and slumped against the wall opposite the hole. I stayed there, staring at it for what felt like an eternity. Its gaseous ooze, likely now filling my entire apartment. Deep within hidden beneath my fear and rage, beneath all the confusion and bewilderment, something pulled on a string. The feeling rose as I sat there staring at the hole. Something compelled me to look into it. I fought the urge as best I could, praying to never look into that darkness ever again. I lasted for as long as I could but broke soon after I heard the voice. It was the same one from my dream. I recognized it instantly. I stood before realizing I was walking towards it. Just like my dream, I looked into it.\n\nThe darkness greeted me once again but the moment my face came to rest against the cool wall I knew something was off. Within its murky confines for the first time, I could almost make something out. Barely more than an outline the gentle edges of something within the shadowed fog could be seen. I could feel my hair stand and my mind screamed at me to run but I stayed. I watched. Paralyzed I saw as at first, it twitched. I got the impression of something bulbous pushing and moving beneath tight skin. Then I saw it. Slowly it opened as the top and bottom parted revealing an eye staring back at me. Its sclera was so impossibly white it almost glowed. Through the darkness I could now see ink-like eyelids and lashes, and in the sea of white sat a black iris. It stared at me unblinking. I screamed and stumbled back from the wall. The moment I did six inky tendrils shot out from within the hole. They moved for my chest in a flash and dug into me. It burned as they writhed beneath my skin. I could feel every twitch as they dug deeper and deeper inside me. I looked up briefly to see the eye pressed against the edges of the hole. It squeezed together as it pushed through making a disgusting wet noise. It dug deeper inside me as the eye grew ever closer. When the wet eye made contact with my skin it didn’t cut through like the tendrils it simply kept moving. It forced itself inside me, burning every inch of the way.\n\nI’m so cold now. I’m freezing, to be honest. It's here. Inside of me. A bulbous protrusion that's found its new home inside my chest. It’s watching me type this. I can feel it wiggling its appendages throughout my body. They're moving everywhere. I feel them work their way through my arms, down my legs, and up my spine. I hear it speak to me. It says I’ve been chosen. It picked me for something. I don’t know what yet but I think we're becoming one. I dont know how long I'll have left, but i feel this is only the beginning. Through its whispers I can see. There's so much I didn’t know. So many ideas. Things not meant for any mortal. Yet it still shows me. It has a purpose for me. For us. Together, we are one.\n\nI made the choice to stare into the darkness and now I will never go back. I’m glad. After all, I finally got my story.",

        "text": "All I ever wanted was the world.\n\nFor nearly all of my life, I have wanted to be an actress — Greta Garbo, Norma Shearer, Mabel Normand. I wanted my name to be counted among them. I wanted people to stand in long lines to see my newest film. I wanted to be loved.\n\nAll of that led me to this moment. I was being awarded for my performance in my latest film. A man in a tuxedo handed me the award, and I was kissed on the cheek by a woman in an evening gown. The audience applauded as they gave me a standing ovation. Some of them were wiping tears from their eyes. *Me*, I thought. *All of this for me.* Before I was able to give my speech, I was shoved forward, causing me to fall onto the wooden floor.\n\n“Louise,” Mama exclaimed. “Wake up! You’re late. You need to help your brother.”\n\nAs I arose from the floor, I wiped the dust off my nightgown. *It was only a dream.* I made my bed, dressed, and I went to work in the laundry downstairs, which was owned by our landlord. We worked in his laundry for room and board in his one–room apartment upstairs.\n\nMy brother scoffed as I walked downstairs and began working. His name was Daniel, but we always called him “Dee.” He asked, “Where were you? I’ve had to do all the work myself for the past hour and a half. Good for nothing!”\n\n“I’m sorry,” I said. “I went to sleep late last night.”\n\n“I know,” Dee replied. “You were at the moviehouse again, weren’t you?”\n\n“Maybe,” I mumbled. “Does it matter?”\n\n“It matters when you’re wasting money Mama and I work hard for,” Dee snapped. “If you pulled your slack around here, you could go to the moviehouse anytime you wanted.”\n\nMama walked downstairs, and she asked, “What are you two doing?”\n\n“We’re working, Mama,” I answered, but Dee interrupted me.\n\n“She wants to spend money, but not work for it.”\n\n“It sounds like neither of you are working,” Mama scolded. “Get back to it.”\n\nMama, Dee, and I worked in the laundry for twelve hours, 10 A. M. to 10 P. M. Mama checked the customers’ clothes in and out, Dee washed and dried their clothes, and I hung the laundered clothes on a rack with wire hangers. Mama used one of her two breaks of the day to cook supper, which we sat down to eat at 11 P. M.\n\nAfter we blessed our meal, Dee hungrily lapped up his bowl of stew, while Mama and I ate more slowly. Between sips from her spoon, Mama asked, “Where were you last night, Louise?”\n\n“What do you mean, Mama?”\n\n“When I went to bed, you weren’t here. Where were you?”\n\n“I was at the moviehouse,” I mumbled.\n\n“I can’t hear you,” Mama said. “Speak up.”\n\n“I was at the moviehouse, Mama.”\n\nMama looked at me, coolly, as she asked, “Why are you spending money you haven’t earned?”\n\n“Tell her, Mama,” Dee interjected, but Mama raised her left hand to silence him.\n\n“I worked all week, Mama,” I answered. “I wanted to relax. . . .”\n\nBefore I was able to finish my sentence, Mama threw her bowl of stew into my face. The lukewarm broth and shreds of beef and carrots fell from my hair into my lap. I wiped my eyes with my handkerchief as Mama stood up from the table.\n\n“Who do you think you are?” Mama spat. “You don’t know what it’s like to work hard. I wish you did. If only you knew how hard I work everyday to give you and your brother beds to sleep in, clothes to wear, and food to eat.”\n\n“I appreciate how hard you work, Mama,” I said. “I’m saying I work hard, too.”\n\n“If you work so hard, Louise, then you should be resting,” Mama said. Reaching over and grabbing my bowl of stew, she continued, “Go to bed. You’ve eaten enough.”\n\n“Mama, I’m hungry. . . .”\n\n“Go to bed.”\n\nTears welled up in my eyes as I stood up from the table, but I wiped them away. I washed my face, dressed in my nightgown, and I went to bed. Mama filled a new bowl, sat back down, and continued her meal with Dee. Pangs of hunger kept me awake most of the night, but I was eventually able to fall asleep.\n\nOn the following morning, Mama and Dee were still sleeping when I woke up. 7 A. M. Three hours before work. Sneaking out of bed, I went to the kitchen, and I ate what remained of the stew in the stewpot. It was cold and slimy, but it was food.\n\n“What are you doing?”\n\nI turned around, and I saw Dee, out of bed, rubbing the sleep from his eyes.\n\n“I’m washing the dishes,” I lied. “I’ll get ready for work soon.”\n\nI finished washing the dishes as Dee readied himself for work in the bathroom. Mama woke up shortly thereafter, and she went into the bathroom to wash her face. She left her drawer in the wardrobe open. I looked inside at her beautiful dresses, which I was forbidden to wear. Although I could not wear it, I loved her white evening gown. It was an ethereal white, like the wings of an angel. Mama stopped wearing these dresses after Daddy left. Mama abruptly shut her drawer as she returned from the bathroom.\n\n“Get ready for work, Louise,” she said.\n\nI went to the bathroom, washing my face, hair, and hands, and I started to dress. As I looked in the mirror, I thought I could see a resemblance to Renée Adorée as Melisande in *The Big Parade*. I started posing in the mirror, but I was interrupted by Mama, who knocked once before she opened the unlocked bathroom door.\n\n“What are you doing?” Mama asked.\n\n“I’m getting ready, Mama.”\n\n“No, you aren’t,” Mama said. “You were posing in the mirror.”\n\nBefore I was able to respond, Mama continued, “Aren’t you ashamed? A seventeen year old girl with these childlike fantasies about becoming an actress. Do you think the girls in pictures come from laundries in Kansas? No, Louise, they don’t. They come from better places than this. Stop your play–acting. You’re nothing, and you’ll always be nothing. Finish in the bathroom, and join your brother and I downstairs.”\n\nI flinched as Mama slammed the door. Tears started streaming down my face. *She’s right*, I thought. *I’m* nothing. Yet there was a spark of hope left within me. *I* can *become something. I just need to leave this place. If I’m ever going to become an actress, I need to go to Hollywood.* Finishing in the bathroom, I joined Mama and Dee downstairs, where, unbeknownst to them, I worked my last day in the laundry.\n\nAfter we finished our work at 10 P. M., Mama, Dee, and I went upstairs to eat supper and go to bed. Mama allowed me to eat my bowl of stew from the night prior, while she and Dee ate freshly prepared bowls of stew. I sipped the cold broth and ate the soggy vegetables in silence as Mama and Dee talked to each other as if I was not there. We finished supper, and we readied ourselves for bed. Mama and Dee fell asleep, but I lay awake in bed, mustering up the courage to go through with my plan to run away.\n\nGetting out of bed as quietly as I could, I reached under my mattress, where I hid my purse. For the past year and a half, I had been saving money, mostly for the moviehouse. *I had enough for the bus fare to Los Angeles.* Returning the money to my purse, I crawled on the floor to the wardrobe, opening Mama’s drawer. I took her white evening gown, and I placed it in a bag that I took from the laundry. I returned to my bedside, where I took off my nightgown, and I dressed for the bus.\n\nAs I walked to and opened the door, I looked behind me. *Was I making a mistake?* I wondered. Looking at Mama and Dee, I felt a wave of regret wash over me. In spite of everything, I still loved them. *I can’t let that stop me*, I thought. *I have to do this. It’s my only chance.* I walked out of the apartment, closing the door, and I headed toward the bus depot.\n\nArriving in Los Angeles, I was fortunate enough to easily find an affordable room to rent. I scoured all of the papers for audition notices, and I went to each and every one. However, the casting directors always had an explanation for why they did not choose me — *We’re looking for a blonde.* *Too young.* *You don’t have enough experience.* With each rejection, I felt I was being punished. *Why?* It had to be because I abandoned Mama and Dee. *They were right about me.* I was an immature, ugly, and, above all, untalented girl from nowhere. I had no right to be an actress. Returning to my room after another failed audition, I remembered rent was due in a few days. I was running low on money, and I began to contemplate going home. *The prodigal daughter.* I knew exactly what Mama and Dee would say — *We told you so.*\n\nAs I counted what little remained of my money, I decided I would go home. However, I wanted to say goodbye to Hollywood by going to the moviehouse one last time. They were playing *The Big Parade*, starring John Gilbert and Renée Adorée. When the lights went up at the end of the picture, I was shocked back to reality. It was like a cruel joke. I wanted nothing more than to become an actress, and I could not do it, even in Hollywood.\n\nI was leaving the auditorium when I felt a tug on my arm. I turned around, and I saw a girl, who appeared to be around my age. She gestured for me to follow her back into the auditorium, and we sat down. Her hair was a blonde bob, and her makeup was bold and beautiful.\n\n“I’m Hazel,” she said. “What’s your name, honey?”\n\n“Louise,” I answered.\n\n“Well, Louise, I have to ask you something. . . .” Hazel trailed off as she introduced the man that walked up behind her. “This is Charlie. My boyfriend. We saw you enter the auditorium, and we made a bet with each other. Now, answer, honestly. Are you in pictures?”\n\nI felt myself blush as Hazel giggled.\n\n“Are you?” Charlie asked.\n\n“No,” I answered. “I’m not in pictures.”\n\n“Oh!” Charlie exclaimed. “You owe me a drink, Hazel.”\n\n“I’ll get you an ice cream soda,” Hazel retorted. Returning her attention to me, Hazel said, “Remember I said we made a bet? I bet him that you were in pictures. He said if you were in pictures, you wouldn’t come to a moviehouse like this. . . . Well, I guess I was wrong. There’s a first time for everything.”\n\nShaking my head, I repeated, softly, “I’m not in pictures.”\n\n“You’d be perfect,” Charlie interjected. “If I may offer my opinion.”\n\n“Thank you. . . .” I trailed off as Charlie interrupted me.\n\n“Do you want to be in pictures?”\n\n“Who doesn’t?” Hazel interjected.\n\n“Let her answer, Hazel.”\n\n“No,” I said. “She’s right. Who wouldn’t want to be in pictures?”\n\n“I have a friend,” Charlie said. Reaching into his pocket for a business card, he handed it to me. “Jack Morgan. Tell him I sent you. He’ll get you into pictures.”\n\nAs I looked at the business card with trembling hands, I said, “What?”\n\n“Call Jack tomorrow morning,” Hazel said. “Tell him we sent you. He’ll get you into pictures. Do you understand?”\n\n“Yes,” I stammered. “Yes, I think I do.”\n\nHugging me, Hazel exclaimed, “Oh, honey, this will be your big break. Congratulations!”\n\nWalking back to my room in a heavenly daze, I fell back on the bed as Hazel’s words echoed in my mind – “This will be your big break!” I sat up, and I walked out to the lobby of the boarding house to use their telephone. I called the number on the business card, and a man answered.\n\n“Hello?”\n\n“Hello,” I stuttered. “Is this Jack Morgan?”\n\n“Yes,” Jack said. “Who’s calling?”\n\n“My name’s Louise,” I answered. “Your friends Charlie and Hazel told me to call you.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Oh, I’m sorry,” I exclaimed. “They said you could get me into pictures.”\n\n“I see,” he said. “Can you come to my studio tomorrow morning?”\n\n*Was I dreaming again?*\n\n“Yes, Mr. Morgan,” I answered. “I’ll be there. What’s your address?”\n\n“Call me ‘Jack,’” he said. He gave me his address, and concluded, “I’ll see you tomorrow morning.”\n\n“Yes,” I replied. “Thank you. Goodbye.”\n\nI returned the telephone to its cradle, and I went back to my room. *My big break!* I set my hair into finger waves, so I would look like a potential actress during my meeting with Jack. Although I was able to drift off to sleep, I tossed and turned all night, because of the butterflies in my otherwise empty stomach.\n\nAt 7 A. M., I woke up to get ready for my meeting with Jack. My finger waves came out perfectly, and I made myself up to look as beautiful as possible. Taking a deep breath, I walked out of my room, headed to Jack’s studio, saying goodbye to the girl I was.\n\nWhen I arrived at the studio, I was confused by its size. It was not much bigger than our apartment in Kansas. Shrugging off the small size of the studio, I knocked on the door, and it was answered by one of the most handsome men I have ever seen out of pictures. He did not look much older than I was. I tried to stammer an introduction, but I was unsuccessful. The man laughed as he introduced himself.\n\n“Hello,” he said. Extending his hand for a handshake, “Jack Morgan.”\n\n“Louise,” I replied. “Louise Parker. I telephoned you about getting into pictures.”\n\n“Yes,” he said. “Please, come in.”\n\nI walked into the studio, which was nicely furnished. As I looked around, Jack asked, “Would you like something to drink?”\n\n“No,” I answered. “I don’t drink.”\n\n“That’s a good girl, but I meant a drink of water,” Jack chuckled. I blushed as he continued, “So, Louise, you want to be in pictures?”\n\n“Yes,” I answered. “More than anything.”\n\n“May I tell you something?”\n\n“Certainly.”\n\nAs I sat down on his couch, Jack sat down on a chair opposite me.\n\n“It’s difficult to get into pictures, Louise. I’m not going to lie. You’ve got to be strong and tenacious. If you choose to give up after your first rejection, you would’ve never made it in Hollywood in the first place. Superficially, you have to be young and beautiful, but you need to be tenacious, first and foremost. If you don’t have that, you’ll never be a star. Fame comes at a price, and everyone’s got to pay it before they make it. Everyone has to start somewhere.”\n\nBefore I was able to respond, Jack asked, “Are you ready for your screen test?”\n\n“Yes,” I answered, but I trailed off as I looked around the studio. “Where?”\n\n“Come with me.”\n\nHelping me to my feet, Jack led me to the set in the back of the studio. There was a bed with white bed linens, a vanity stand, and a camera positioned in front of the vanity stand. Jack gestured to the chair, and he said, “Please, sit down.”\n\nI did not know what was happening, but I trusted Jack knew what he was doing. I sat on the chair in front of the vanity stand as he prepared his camera.\n\n“Now, Louise, we’ll be filming a screen test,” Jack said. “You’ll act in a short scene, so directors and producers will be able to see how you perform as an actress. It doesn’t mean you’ve got the part, but it shows they’re considering you.”\n\nJack and I looked at each other as he prepared his camera. He smiled as I blushed.\n\n“I’ve started filming,” Jack said. “Now, please, take off your makeup.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“Take off your makeup,” Jack repeated. “Take it off like you’re getting ready for bed. That’s the scene.”\n\nAlthough I was confused by the concept of this screen test, I trusted Jack knew more than I did, so I turned toward the mirror, and I started taking off my makeup with a washcloth and cold cream.\n\n“Now, stop, and start to undress.”\n\n*What?* I was taken aback. *Undress?*\n\nJack stopped the camera, and he asked, “Did you hear me?”\n\n“Yes,” I answered. I started to feel a gnawing sensation in the pit of my stomach. “I don’t know if I can do that.”\n\n“You can,” Jack assured. “Everyone has to start somewhere, right?”\n\n“. . . .Right,” I sighed. I started undressing, and Jack filmed. I was down to my panties, and Jack instructed, “Take off your underwear.”\n\nI took off my panties, baring my nude body to the camera.\n\n“Please, Lulu, spin around for me,” Jack directed, and I did as I was told.\n\n“That’ll do it,” Jack said. He turned off the camera, and he continued, “You may get dressed.”\n\nAs I was putting my clothes back on, Jack examined the film of the screen test, and he smiled.\n\n“I’ll show this to all of the directors and producers I know. You’ll be a star. Wait and see.”\n\nI smiled, sadly, as Jack walked me out of the studio. He paid me for the screen test, and he repeated his promise to show it to his friends. I gave him the telephone number of my boarding house in case there were any developments. As I walked back to my room, I started to cry. *What have I done?* Once I entered my room, I laid down, and I could not help but sob into my pillow, crumpling up the dollar bills in my hand.\n\nI was awoken the next morning by a knock at my door. I answered the door, and the owner informed me, “You had a telephone call at the front desk, Ms. Parker.”\n\n“Thank you,” I replied. The owner left, and I closed the door to get dressed. I walked out to the lobby of the boarding house, and I returned the telephone call.\n\n“Hello,” Jack said.\n\nI felt a wave of nausea hit me when I heard his voice.\n\n“Hello,” I stuttered. “You called me?”\n\nBefore I was able to say anything else, Jack asked, “Yes. Are you able to come to my studio this afternoon, Lulu?”\n\n*What did he want?* I was curious, but I had many obvious misgivings. *Had he not taken enough already?*\n\n“Why?”\n\n“There have been developments,” Jack answered. “With regard to your screen test.”\n\nAs I thought about it, Jack continued, “You’ll be elated by the news.”\n\nAgainst my better judgment, I said, “Yes, I’ll come to your studio.”\n\n“Thank you,” Jack replied. “I’ll see you shortly.”\n\nI returned the telephone to its cradle, and I walked back to my room to retrieve my handbag, which contained my payment for the screen test. I was going to return it to Jack before I boarded a bus to Kansas. I would take back my self–respect. I walked to Jack’s studio, and as I approached the small building, I saw an unfamiliar car parked in front. *Who was here?* Nevertheless, I knocked on the door, and Jack answered.\n\n“Lulu,” Jack beamed. “Please, come in.”\n\nI walked inside, and I saw an older, mustachioed man, dressed in a suit. He was examining a strip of film from Jack’s camera.\n\n“Mr. Verdon,” Jack said. “She’s here.”\n\nTurning around, Mr. Verdon smiled at me, and I was dumbstruck.\n\nDavid D. Verdon was a film producer, whose credits included some of the biggest hits in Hollywood. He produced several of my own personal favorites. In addition, he was known as “The Starmaker,” because actors and actresses who acted in his films almost always became overnight sensations. If Hollywood was a kingdom, David D. Verdon would be one of the contenders for the title of King.\n\n“Hello,” Mr. Verdon said. Extending his hand for a handshake, he introduced himself, “I’m David D. Verdon. It’s lovely to meet you.”\n\n“Hello,” I said, timidly, before I shook his hand. “It’s an honor to meet you, Mr. Verdon. I’m a big fan.”\n\n“Thank you,” Mr. Verdon replied. “Did Jack tell you?”\n\nI looked at Jack, who shook his head, and he answered, “No. Tell her, David.”\n\n“It is my pleasure to inform you that you are in consideration for my newest picture.”\n\n“What?” I asked. “Pardon me, Mr. Verdon, but how do you even know who I am?”\n\n“I saw your screen test.”\n\nThe color drained from my face. *He saw my screen test?* Flustered, I attempted to explain myself before Mr. Verdon chuckled, holding up his hand to silence me.\n\n“There’s no need to explain, Ms. . . .” Mr. Verdon trailed off as I realized I had not introduced myself to him.\n\n“Parker,” I answered. “Louise Parker.”\n\n“We’ll have to do something about that,” Mr. Verdon grimaced. “Regardless, you have the makings of a star. We’ll just need to see a couple of more screen tests from you.”\n\nI was profoundly uncomfortable with the prospect of filming more screen tests, but I said, “Of course, Mr. Verdon.”\n\nAfter we exchanged pleasantries, Mr. Verdon bade Jack and me farewell, and he left the studio. Immediately, Jack embraced me in a hug, saying, “Congratulations, Lulu! You’ve all but nabbed the part!” After he released me from the hug, he continued, “I’ve scheduled a screen test for tomorrow morning. Are you available?”\n\nStardom was within my grasp.\n\nIn spite of everything I felt and said before I arrived at the studio, I answered, “Yes.”\n\nI arrived at the studio before noon the following day. Jack invited me in, and he led me to a man, who introduced himself as Armando. He looked somewhat older than I was, but he was handsome. Jack referred to him as the “male talent,” my “costar.” The gnawing sensation in the pit of my stomach returned, but I ignored it.\n\nAfter I met Armando, Jack led me to the vanity stand, where he instructed me to remove my makeup. I did as I was told, and I turned around to see Jack standing next to a naked Armando.\n\nI averted my eyes immediately, and I could feel myself blush. I had never seen a naked man before. Armando laughed heartily as he walked to the bed, and Jack came up to me.\n\n“This is the screen test,” Jack explained. “A romantic scene. Have fun.”\n\nJack helped me to my feet, and he led me to the bed, where Armando lay naked. I lay on the right side of the bed, facing away from Armando, who came up behind me, unzipping my dress. Jack prepared his camera, and he announced, “Here we go.”\n\nAs he slipped my sleeves off my shoulders, Armando took off my dress and undergarments, which Jack directed him to do. He kissed me. *My first kiss.* His kisses were soft and tender, but I could smell and taste the alcohol and cigarettes on his lips. I did not want to do this, but I thought, *This is what Mr. Verdon wants.* I could not waste this chance to become an actual actress. After a deep breath, I started to reciprocate Armando’s actions, and I lay there as he took my virginity. *How special.*\n\nAfter it was over, Armando said, breathily, “Congratulations, Louise. You were perfect.”\n\n“You were,” Jack added. As I quickly redressed, Jack continued, “This is exactly what Mr. Verdon wants to see.”\n\n“What if he doesn’t like it?” I asked.\n\n“He will, Lulu,” Jack assured. “He knows art from filth. This is art.”\n\nLeading me out of the studio, Jack paid me for the screen test, and he told me, “Your last screen test is tomorrow. Don’t forget. It’ll be big.”\n\nWith a wink, Jack closed the door on me.\n\nI was alone.\n\nAll alone.\n\nAs I was walking back to the boarding house, I saw a couple of people leaving a Catholic church. Dee and I were baptized Catholic, but Mama could never take us to church, because she almost always worked on Sundays. Despite the fact we rarely attended Mass, Mama ensured that Dee and I received our Sacraments, and she taught us our prayers. I walked up the steps of the church, and I looked inside to see a statue of the Blessed Mother. She had a smile of indescribable bliss on her face. Entering the church, I crossed myself with Holy Water, and I entered the confessional.\n\n“Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.”\n\n“How long has it been since your last Confession?”\n\n“I’m sorry, Father,” I answered. “I can’t remember.”\n\n“I understand,” Father said. “Tell me what you can remember.”\n\n“I don’t know where to begin.”\n\n“You should begin wherever God takes you first.”\n\n“I’ve sinned against God in so many ways, but I’ll try,” I said. “Firstly, I ran away from home.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“I wanted to come to Hollywood to be an actress,” I admitted. “It’s stupid.”\n\nBefore Father could respond, I continued, “And I abandoned Mama and my brother, Dee.”\n\n“Go on,” Father said.\n\n“I abandoned them like Daddy did. Why? To become an actress. Mama and Dee thought it was stupid to want to become an actress. They were right. I’m nothing. After I was turned away the first time, I should’ve gone home, but I didn’t want to admit I was a failure. Now, Father, I’ve become involved in something bad, and I don’t know if I can get out of it.”\n\n“What is it?”\n\nEvading his question, I continued, “I don’t even know if God Himself could help me. Is that a sin? I’m sorry. You know, Father, I’ve believed since I was a little girl that even if Mama and Dee hated me, God loved me. Does He still love me? I don’t know anymore. I’ve done nothing but sin against Him. I wouldn’t blame Him if He hated me.”\n\n“My daughter,” Father said. “God hates no one. His forgiveness, love, and mercy are everlasting, but it is our choice whether to accept them or not.”\n\n“Is that true?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“I don’t know,” I said. “I’ve done bad things, Father, awful, horrible, terrible things, all to become an actress, and I don’t know if I can, or if I even want to, stop now.”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“There’s something inside of me, Father. I want to be seen. I want to be heard. I want to be adored. I don’t know much, Father, but if this is my only chance, wouldn’t it be more of a sin to waste what God gave me? I know I’ve got talent. No matter what Mama and Dee said. I might not have as much talent as the girls in pictures, but I’ve got something. So, Father, I can’t stop now. I can’t go home. I can’t go back to Mama. I can’t go back to Dee. I can’t go back to the laundry. The laundry with its filth and sweat and wire hangers. No, I can’t do that, Father. I’ve got to do this.”\n\nBefore Father could respond, I abruptly left the confessional, and I walked out of the church. I returned to my room in the boarding house to prepare for my third and final screen test.\n\nI was awoken the next morning by a knock at my door. I answered the door, and the owner informed me that I had received another telephone call.\n\n“Thank you,” I said. The owner left, and I closed the door to get dressed. I walked out to the lobby of the boarding house, and I returned Jack’s telephone call.\n\n“Hello?”\n\n“Hello, Jack,” I replied. “I was told you called me.”\n\n“I had to tell you, Lulu, that your final screen test will be filmed at Mr. Verdon’s private residence,” Jack answered. “It’s classy, so dress the part. I’ll pick you up around 7 P. M.”\n\n“I will,” I said. “Goodbye.”\n\nI returned the telephone to its cradle, and I walked back to my room to prepare for the screen test. I rummaged through my clothes, and I pulled out Mama’s dress. I laid it out on the bed as I did my hair and makeup. I wanted to feel and look like the most beautiful actress of all time. My finger waves came out perfectly, and my makeup complemented the angelic white of Mama’s dress. After I put on the dress, I looked in the mirror, and I saw a star looking back.\n\nAs 7 P. M. neared, I knelt by my bedside, and I crossed myself.\n\n“I’m sorry for what I’m about to do.”\n\nThere was a knock at my door.\n\nI wiped away a tear as I crossed myself again, and I answered the door. I followed the owner to the lobby of his boarding house, where I met Jack, who led me to his car. He drove us to Mr. Verdon’s residence. When we arrived, I saw Mr. Verdon standing outside of his house. Jack and I walked arm–in–arm to Mr. Verdon, who kissed me on my cheek.\n\n“My dear Louise,” Mr. Verdon said. “It’s lovely to see you again.”\n\n“Thank you,” I beamed. However, I was soon distracted by the sound of voices coming from inside the house. Confused, I asked, “I thought we’d be alone?”\n\nAs he and Jack chuckled, Mr. Verdon explained, “They’re your costars this evening.”\n\nI started to feel the familiar gnawing sensation in the pit of my stomach.\n\nA whisper of a voice spoke within me.\n\n*Don’t go inside the house.*\n\nJack and Mr. Verdon offered me their arms, and we walked to the front door.\n\nThe whisper grew louder.\n\n*Don’t go inside the house.*\n\nAs Mr. Verdon turned the doorknob, the whisper became a scream.\n\n*Don’t go inside the house!*\n\nThe guests’ voices fell silent as we walked into the house. They were dressed in formal evening wear. Jack joined the guests as Mr. Verdon presented me to them. I felt like a lamb being led to the slaughter.\n\n“This is Ms. Parker,” Mr. Verdon said. “Our newest star.”\n\nThe guests, all of whom I recognized from pictures produced by Mr. Verdon, greeted me enthusiastically, shaking my hands, kissing me on the cheeks, and embracing me in hugs.\n\n“Welcome,” Mr. Verdon said. “Shall we get started?”\n\n“Now?” I asked, timidly, as Mr. Verdon and the guests chuckled.\n\n“Yes,” Mr. Verdon answered. “Now.”\n\nA pair of men emerged from the shadows, grabbed my arms from behind, and dragged me to the front room. My screams were stifled by a hand over my mouth. Mr. Verdon followed us, slowly, and I saw an inverted pentagram drawn on the black marble floor in white chalk. I struggled harder, but the men held my arms firm in their grips. I was laid on top of the pentagram, and I was bound by my hands and feet, spread–eagle in the center of the front room. The men who dragged and bound me walked away to join the other guests as Jack and Mr. Verdon walked toward me. The guests’ shadows hovered high above the three of us.\n\nTerrified, I tried in vain to tear free from my restraints.\n\n“My dear Louise. . . .” Mr. Verdon trailed off. Looking around at his guests, he said, “We have to do something about that name. ‘Louise Parker.’ Can you not see the notices? ‘Lousy Porker.’ No. That shall not be. Your name is ‘Alice Astor.’”\n\n“Why are you doing this?”\n\n“‘Why?’ Fame comes at a price. You cannot have anything in this life without giving something in return. You gave me your time. Your self–respect. Your dignity. Now, you must give one more thing. Your soul.”\n\nTears trickled down my face.\n\n“Are you the Devil?”\n\n“Maybe.”\n\nMr. Verdon wiped my tears away with his thumb.\n\n“Louise Parker was an unwanted girl from nowhere,” Mr. Verdon continued. “Alice Astor will be the brightest star in Hollywood’s sky.” Standing up, he concluded, “However, it is still your choice. Do you want to return to your life in Kansas, or do you want to stay and live your dreams?”\n\nI could not help but remember everything that led up to this moment. Daddy leaving us, Mama, Dee, and I having to move into that hellhole of a laundry, Mama and Dee’s abuse. I did not want to return to that life. This was my chance to finally leave it behind.\n\nI stopped struggling, and Mr. Verdon smiled.\n\nI nodded my head.\n\nJack started filming.\n\nA man handed Mr. Verdon, who knelt beside me, a dagger and a small basin. With the dagger, he sliced his wrist, and blood flowed into the basin. He rolled up my skirt and sleeves, dipped his finger into the blood, and he drew symbols on my arms and legs I did not recognize. Ripping open Mama’s dress, Mr. Verdon drew an inverted pentagram on my chest. Lifting the basin to his mouth, he drank from it, and then he tilted it into my mouth. As his blood poured into my mouth, I drank it, but I felt pangs of fear when I thought about what I was doing to my immortal soul.\n\nJack stopped filming.\n\nAs I was unbound, Mr. Verdon helped me to my feet, and I stood up, shakily, Mama’s white dress stained with crimson blood. The guests raised their glasses in a toast to me. *Will God ever forgive me?* I did not know, but what scared me most was I did not seem to care.\n\nWhat I did know for certain was that I was going to be a star. *Alice Astor*. The greatest star of all time.\n\nI was going to have the world.\n\nAll I had to give was my [soul](https://reddit.com/r/TheWelshWitch).",

        "text": "Once upon a time, there was a small, isolated town named Millfield,  surrounded by dense, foreboding forests. The town was infamous for its  strange happenings and the eerie darkness that consumed it every night.   \n\n\nOne day, a young woman named Mary moved into the town, eager to escape  the memories of her past and start a new life. She had heard stories of  the strange goings-on in Millfield and was eager to experience them for  herself. But what she found was far more sinister than she could have  ever imagined.    \n\n\nMary couldn't resist the urge to explore the forests, despite the  warnings of the townsfolk. As she walked deeper into the darkness, she  felt a sense of unease that grew with every step. Suddenly, she heard a  voice, and she turned to see a figure shrouded in darkness, advancing  toward her.   \n\n\n \"I am the Guardian of the Forest,\" the voice boomed in her mind. \"I am  here to warn you that the darkness is not what it seems. It is a portal  to a world beyond our own, a world of terror and despair, where you will  never return.\"   \n\n\nMary was terrified, but she couldn't let go of the hope that she would  finally find peace in this strange world. She begged the Guardian to  allow her to enter the portal, promising that she would never reveal its  secrets to anyone else.   \n\n\nThe Guardian reluctantly granted her request, and Mary entered the  portal. She was transported to a world beyond her worst nightmares. The  sky was blood-red, and the ground was covered in a thick, sticky  substance that she quickly realized was blood.   \n\n\nAs she walked, she encountered creatures of unspeakable terror, their  twisted bodies and razor-sharp claws a testament to their insatiable  hunger for flesh. Mary tried to escape, but she was pursued by these  grotesque beings, who seemed to sense her fear and revel in it.   \n\n\nAs she ran, Mary stumbled upon a clearing, where she was confronted by  the Guardian of the Forest. He told her that she must leave the world  beyond the darkness and never return, or she would be consumed by the  horrors within.   \n\n\nBut Mary was unable to resist the lure of the other world and she  returned, time and time again, each time experiencing even greater  terror and violence. Eventually, the creatures caught her, and she was  horrified to see that they were not just mindless beasts, but beings  that enjoyed the suffering of their prey.   \n\n\nThey tore her limb from limb, feasting on her flesh and drinking her  blood. Mary's screams echoed through the darkness, a warning to all who  dared to enter the portal.   \n\n\nYears passed, and the town of Millfield was consumed by a darkness that  no one dared to enter. The townspeople whispered of the young woman who  ventured into the portal and was never seen again, and the Guardian of  the Forest stood watch, a silent reminder of the horrors that lay beyond  the darkness.   \n\n\n And as for Mary, her soul was trapped in the world beyond, forever  doomed to suffer the horrors that she encountered there. Her final  thoughts were of regret, and a longing for the peace that she had sought  but would never find. Her blood-stained bones lay scattered across the  ground, a warning to all who dared to enter the portal and face the  horrors that lay beyond.   \n\n\n The darkness of Millfield was a reminder that some things are best left  untouched, and that there are forces beyond our understanding that we  should fear. The portal remained, waiting for the next unsuspecting soul  to enter and suffer the same fate as Mary. And the Guardian of the  Forest stood watch, a silent warning of the horrors that lay beyond the  darkness.",

        "author": "firecandyy",

        "text": "For all of my twenty-nine years, I have been severely claustrophobic. I don’t mean to say that I’m a little uncomfortable in small spaces. No, what I have is an absolute, overwhelming terror of closets, basements, windowless rooms - anywhere at all that feels contained. I break into a cold sweat just by thinking of the minute elevators in the nearby department building. My brother’s college dorm, with its one small window, devolved me into a hyperventilating mess. Don’t even get me started on the time a friend thought it would be funny to send me pictures of those Hong Kong coffin apartments.   \n\n\nDespite trying every form of exposure therapy and anti-anxiety medication, the phobia never fully subsided. So instead, I created a life around it. My house has an open floor plan with plenty of big windows, and I blocked off the attic the day I moved in. I call restaurants ahead of time to make sure I can be on the main level, near an exit. I won’t go underground, especially in basements or subways, or too far \\*above\\* ground, because of the necessity of elevators. I work from home - but come on, that one isn’t even unusual nowadays! So while I take my meds and log in for my weekly teletherapy appointment (my therapist’s office was a little too “cozy” for my comfort), I don’t like to think I'm missing out on anything.  \n\n\nBut when I met Lucas, that changed.   \n\n\nI know, I know, don’t change yourself for a man, but Lucas was the sweetest, most angelic golden-retriever-boy I’d ever met. Blonde hair, blue eyes, 6 ft, my mom loved him… the total package. He was even a structural engineer. The guy was a constantly smiling ray of sunshine, and he was refreshingly fearless.   \n\n\nLucas also lived in a below-ground apartment.   \n\n\nIt was just while he got started in his career - after all, since he spent so much time away at work, why pay more for a nicer place? The logic was sound, but that didn’t change the shaky feeling I had even just thinking of it. So I never went. Instead, he came over to my house.   \n\n\nAfter a while of dating, though, I think this started to bug him. Not just the apartment thing - the fact that I’d spend ten minutes struggling up the stairs to avoid a quick elevator ride up to his office on the 21st floor. My flat-out refusal to go to his favorite bar, a basement speakeasy. The way I blew a gasket when he opened the previously untouched attic hatch on my ceiling.   \n\n\nIt made me feel so crazy, so ashamed - the look of disappointment and confusion on his usually-cheerful face. So one night, when Lucas hesitantly pitched an idea over dinner, I forced myself to swallow my terror.  \n\n\n“Maybe we could do our own kind of exposure therapy? I’ll help you, and you can take your meds all you want. We’ll go slow, Jane, I promise. Just so you can try and live a normal life.”  \n\n\nA normal life. God, this unsure proposal was the first time I felt I wasn’t “normal” already. The realization pierced me like a spear through the heart.   \n\n\nBut his big blue eyes, full of hope, gave me the tiniest ounce of courage.   \n\n\n“Okay.” My voice was just a whisper, and he lunged around the table to envelope me in a hug.   \n\n\nOur “therapy” began the next day. Lucas had apparently done quite a bit of reading up on phobias, and he decided the best thing to start with would be simply closing the blinds to the windows in my house.   \n\n\nI sat in the living room with shaking hands, staring at the carpet, as I watched the dancing sunny reflections start to dim.   \n\n\n“Practice your breathing exercises,” Lucas urged.   \n\n\nI’d almost forgotten about them. Obediently, I put my shoulders back and placed my tongue on the roof of my mouth.  \n\n\n\\*In. 2. 3. 4.\\*\n\n\\*Hold. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7.\\*\n\n\\*Out. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8.\\*  \n\n\nI needed to focus on my air moving in and out of my lungs. Not the fact that it was starting to feel like the walls were closing in.   \n\n\nShaking my head to clear my mind, I looked around. The walls appeared darker, giving the room a tighter appearance than it did in the light. The windows were shrouded in black, only a faint light emanating from the edge of the blinds.  \n\n\nLucas had completely shaded the first floor now. Every time I exhaled, I could feel the breath being squeezed from my lungs. Like my entire body was being compressed by the closing walls and darkness. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*Calm down. Calm down. It’s just a cover on the window, there’s still air.\\*  \n\n\nBut where was Lucas? I felt completely isolated, trapped in my own home. I stood up. “L-Lucas?”  \n\n\nMy voice came out small and terrified. I sunk to the ground, curled into the fetal position. My head ached as if it there were tight bands around my skull, my brain being pulled inwards by some horrible gravitational force. The racing pulse of my heart made my breath skip and sputter. I squeezed my eyes closed.   \n\n\n“LUCAS!”  \n\n\nSuddenly, there were warm palms on my knees. “I’m right here, baby. It’s okay. You’re doing it, you’re doing it!”  \n\n\n“Open the shades,” I begged helplessly.   \n\n\n“Janie, open your eyes. Do the grounding exercises we talked about. What’s five things you can see?”  \n\n\nBlinking through the tears, I saw his angelic face in front of me. “You?” I offered.   \n\n\n“Keep going.”  \n\n\nThe walls. The dark, threatening, compressing walls stealing my oxygen. \\*No, don’t think about that.\\*   \n\n\n“I can… I can see the coffee table.”  \n\n\n“What else?”  \n\n\nI scanned the room. “The doorway. The lamp. The couch.”  \n\n\n“What about four things you can feel?”  \n\n\nThe rug, soft beneath my feet. His hands heating my legs. The chair I leaned back against. My arms wrapped tight around my chest. \\*Oh.\\*  \n\n\nI loosened my grip, and felt the relief of some more air entering my lungs. Things were coming back into focus now. It was just my living room. It didn’t look too different than it did at night - just without the view from the window.   \n\n\nLucas noticed the change and smiled his big, sunshine grin. “That doesn’t feel so scary, does it?”  \n\n\nI had to admit that it didn’t. As scary as the experience was, when I grounded myself, I could see nothing had really changed.   \n\n\nFrom that point on, we did daily DIY therapy. At first, I had to be the one closing the shades. Then I had to try to sit in my small bathroom with the door shut and shades down. Next, we tried walking up and down tight stairwells. That one really put me into a panic at first, but when I focused on the feeling of the cold metal handrail - and the door in front of me - it wasn’t so impossible. Or really, it didn’t seem as petrifying because I had Lucas by my side. Even when he pushed me a little harder than I thought was necessary, I trusted him. It was almost funny - this man I’d met only a couple months ago could convince me to face fears I’d avoided for almost thirty years.   \n\n\nAnd so a few weeks into our work, Lucas decided that I had to visit his apartment. I gulped when he said it. I guess I knew that was coming, but for some reason the idea of his closed little underground place triggered my anxiety more than anything we’d tried yet.   \n\n\n“I don’t think I’m ready yet,” I told him gently. “Why don’t we try something above ground first?”  \n\n\n“You’re never going to feel ready, you’ve got to just make yourself do it!”  \n\n\n“I know, but it’ll take time. I want to, I promise, but I don’t want to push too hard and make the phobia worse.”  \n\n\nSuddenly, my boyfriend’s usually-sweet blue eyes darkened. “That’s bullshit.”  \n\n\nShocked, I opened my mouth to respond, but was cut off.   \n\n\n“Jane, it’s not getting any worse. That’s a cop out. I thought you were ready to make a difference in your life. I thought I was enough for you to want to make your life better. I guess I’m just not enough.”  \n\n\nLucas ran his hand over his face. His tone changed from anger to defeat, and he turned away from me.   \n\n\n“Of course you’re enough! You’re perfect! I’m just… I’m just… I’m scared.”  \n\n\nI grabbed his shoulder and turned him around, embracing him. He didn’t move.   \n\n\n“So you’ll try?” Lucas asked, his voice quiet and cool.   \n\n\nI wasn’t sure I’d agreed to that, but he’d been right to push me in the past, hadn’t he? “I… I guess so.”  \n\n\nLucas’ arms encased me in his warmth, and my joyful partner had returned.   \n\n\nThe next day, after taking my medication with a steaming cup of chamomile tea, I stood outside his apartment with shaky legs.  \n\n\nThe front door was down five stairs, each one bringing me further to the small, coffin-like basement that I imagined awaited me. I got down one before stopping and sitting on the step, heart racing. Lucas’ voice came from behind the door. “You can do this, baby!”  \n\n\nBut I couldn’t. It was as if every cell in my body, every minute atom, was screaming at me to run and never look back. I watched a dead leaf fall down by the door where I could never go, and I couldn’t help but weep.  \n\n\nEventually, Lucas came out, unsmiling and holding a glass of juice. He stiffly presented it to me, and I thirstily gulped it down, exhausted by the ordeal.  \n\n\n“Let’s go home,” I sighed.   \n\n\nLucas looked frustrated all of a sudden, his eyes darkening just as they had the night before. “But you’re almost there, Jane! Stop crying, you just need to push yourself.”  \n\n\nHis irritation provoked my own. “I am! I’ve spent thirty years with this phobia, Lucas, it’s not going to go away over night. I’m sorry if that disappoints you, but I’m not going to be pushed into doing anything else that I don’t want to do!”  \n\n\nAt that, my boyfriend exploded. “That you don’t want to do? So now you don’t want to be with me? You don’t want to live a normal life?”  \n\n\n“I’m happy with my life!” I yelled.   \n\n\n“YOU SHOULDN’T BE! I mean, look at you, Jane! You’re like, \\*stunted\\*. Before you met me, you weren’t progressing at all!”  \n\n\nThe sting from his words took a second to hit me. But after a moment of appalled silence, I got up and left. There was nothing else to say.   \n\n\nIt was about fifteen minutes later, whilst storming back to my house, that I realized I felt… off. My surroundings seemed blurry, the sky too bright, and I couldn’t seem to focus on any of it. My mind felt full of static, my body becoming unbearably heavy. I suddenly had an overwhelming urge to close my eyes.   \n\n\nAnd I was barely conscious when a black sedan drove up next to me, and familiar arms dragged my limp form into the trunk.",

        "text": "It always surprises me how special we humans think we are. We think ourselves to be the apex predators on this planet, the greatest, and the smartest beings to ever crawl out of the primordial ooze. The truth is far from that of course.\n\nYou see, humans are not apex predators, there are things that go bump in the night, things that remain unseen while eyeing us from the shadows. Things that do in fact hunt us, some for sustenance, others for sport.\n\nThe really funny part is that humans used to know about these things, but as our night sky got lit up with artificial stars and our homes pierced the clouds, we got arrogant. Humans forgot the old ways and chose to label the knowledge of the ancients as myths and legends. Such a dreadful mistake.\n\nNow, I know you’re wondering who I am and why I’m telling you this. I am but a mere scholar, one who comes from a long lineage of scholars who studied the things most men do not believe to exist, those creatures right beyond our field of vision, in every dark corner just out of view. My family knew all about them, what they were, where they came from, and even how to get rid of them in certain cases.\n\nThat’s right, we were the best and only real supernatural researchers on the planet, but unfortunately, we flew a little too close to the sun, and now I’m the only one left… anyway, I’m not here to complain about my family’s cruel fate, I’m here to share some of its knowledge with you.\n\nI’m not getting any younger and the thought of all of my family’s hard work going down the drain doesn’t sit well with me, so I might as well share it with as many people as I could, even though I know you won’t believe any of it.\n\nThe monstrosity I want to tell about might just be the biggest threat to humanity, I know that is a big claim, and no it’s not what you’re thinking about. It’s not a demon or some old god, it’s a simple being of flesh and blood, just like you and me, but it is far more terrifying than you can imagine.\n\n“he who mimics the wailing” is the name given to it by the native people of the Americas, of course, they weren’t the only ones to come in contact with it, nor were they the first to do so, but they truly named it best.\n\nNow, I could give a 2-hour lesson on the history and possible sightings of this thing, but that would be boring. So instead, I’ll be reading you the journal of Thomas Clarke, a British scholar, explorer, and sailor who encountered the creature in the depths of Africa in 1744. Big parts of the journal were lost due to time and the whole thing had to be reconstructed however, it is still the best single source of information about the creature ever found, so please, enjoy.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**Day 14:**\n\nWe are lost… so very lost, god help us, for we cannot help ourselves.\n\nThe forest seems to be endless, we haven’t seen any locals since the incident, and while hunger isn’t an issue due to the abundance of small game all around us, our water is running out at an alarming rate.\n\nJohn and William are getting tired and impatient, and they are talking their frustration out on Chima. Those uneducated fools know that she’s the only one who can speak the native language, and while her English is shabby, her translation skills are still invaluable.\n\nI personally think they are jealous of the girl; her hunting and tracking skills would put even the most skilled hunters of Britain to shame. She has been much more useful than they have so far, that’s for sure.\n\nShe’s the only native we have on hand, yet they refuse to leave her alone. Richard on the other hand is getting paranoid and scaring the others even more, he claims that he’s being watched at night by something evil, he feels eyes staring at him he says as if something is looking at him while salivating, a predator the likes of which we’ve never seen before.\n\nHow childish. He might be a man of god and representative of the church, but such illusions of demons and devils can’t be tolerated. Everything in this forest fears fire, and even the most fearsome beast can be put down with our muskets. If there is something to fear, it should be our lack of clean water.\n\nThe other two are illiterate sailors and work hands, their ignorance could be tolerated if not excused, but expect more from a well-read man such as Richard, even if what he is read on is a bunch of superstitious nonsense. \n\nAh, dusk is fast approaching, we’ll camp here for tonight and move at first light tomorrow. We need to conserve our strength and resources or we might just not make it out of here.\n\n**Day 16:**\n\nWilliam struck Chima last night, and Richard got in a fight with him over it. both those fools are squabbling over pointless things while we’re lost in a bloody endless jungle.\n\nChima tried to stop William from going to relieve himself in the nearby trees, she screamed, pushed, and even clawed at him in a frenzied state. She was scared out of her wits, screaming “danger”, “he watch”, “stay group” in her broken English at all of us.\n\nShe’s been getting more and more uneasy since we set foot here, once the sun comes down she acts completely differently. She looks behind her back constantly, and even her breathing becomes faster and more rigid as if she’s in a constant state of terror. \n\nAt first, I thought she was just being foolish like Richard. Afraid of some nonexistent monster hiding in the depths of the jungle, but I’m starting to feel doubtful. I’ve seen how this girl can hunt, how fast she can move, and shoot a long bow. She’s clearly an experienced hunter who’s no stranger to dealing with predators… so why? Why is she panicking to such a degree now?\n\nPerhaps I’m growing paranoid too. I should focus more on getting us out of here because the others certainly aren’t.\n\n**Day 19:**\n\nAm I going mad? Are the paranoia and fear getting to me? \n\nI felt it too last night… that sensation of being watched from the darkness by something not of this world.\n\nIt persisted all night long and only let up when the warm rays of sunlight illuminated this dastardly jungle. I couldn’t sleep a wink, how could I? every time I closed my eyes I could feel the thing’s breath on the back of my neck, as if it was right behind me at all times, ready to feast on my innards as soon as I drop my guard.\n\nI was so tired I even failed to remember that the last of our water runs out today. The others haven’t noticed yet and I can’t bring myself to tell them, they will panic for sure and might even turn violent. We must find a way out of this cursed jungle today, otherwise, it might become our grave.\n\n**Day 20:**\n\nDisaster struck today… John left us to go off on his own after he and the others noticed that we had no water left.\n\nAs expected he panicked and ran off with his musket to go hunt for a river or pond of fresh water. I tried to convince him that such water would still be undrinkable even if boiled, but he did not listen.\n\nIf a person gets out of sight for even a minute they can no longer be found here. The vegetation is so thick and the trees so dense that even the sunlight can’t penetrate some parts of this jungle.\n\nNightfall has halted our attempts to find him, and we have decided to rest until the morning, saving whatever strength we have left. If we move too much our thirst will only amplify.\n\nI’m ashamed to admit that I even turned to Richard for spiritual guidance as my sleep deteriorated more, but he had no help to offer, and how could he when his situation was worse than mine?\n\nHe told that he could hear the devil whisper in his ear, he could not understand its words but he clearly felt intent behind them. “It was pleading for me to help it,” he said. I would’ve laughed at such claims before but I would be a fool to do so now, for I too can hear the devil’s raspy, cold voice once the sun goes down.\n\nIt was probably what made Chima so horrified of the night too, she was more in tune with the forest after all so she must have heard it before us, or perhaps she knows what it is, but It doesn’t matter, we won’t live for much longer without water anyway.\n\n**Day 21:**\n\nWe have found John or what was left of him at least. He was torn apart limb from limb, his flesh was flayed, and his throat, brain, and face were missing along with his lungs. It was a grizzly scene for the others and I to witness, but it was especially daunting for William, for John was like a brother to him.\n\nThe only reason we even knew it was John was because of the musket next to his corpse and the boots on his feet, there was no face or even eyes for us to recognize him from after all.\n\nChima was the one to find the desecrated cadaver laid down by some trees not too far from where we set up camp last night. Fear is still apparent on her face, but I do not think it’s because of what she saw per se, but what it signified.\n\nI believe his death to be the work of the devil, the same one who stalks us through these woods once the safety of the sun is no more. I tried to ask her about it, hoping to maybe get something other than incoherent mumbling.\n\n“together stay, night come no leave alone”, “can’t let take people, more he take, more he know” she repeated those exact words over and over again. she knows precisely what is out there I’m sure of it now, I tried to get her to tell me more by force but Richard intervened. As tired and thirsty as we both were that ever-so-persistent fool still found the energy to get in my way.\n\nI must get some rest for now, I haven’t heard the voice of the devil or felt his hungering gaze fall upon me since the night has fallen, perhaps that is a sign that John’s flesh has sated his appetite for the time being.\n\n**Day 25:**\n\nWilliam is dead, the devil took him as well. Chima and Richard were asleep when it happened yet I, unfortunately, woke up when the rustling of bushes disturbed my slumber. I opened my eyes and was met with the most peculiar visage. William was up on his feet with the widest smile on his face, staring off into the darkness of the night.\n\nI managed to muster whatever strength I had left and stood up as well, carrying the musket beside me as I feared the worst. I called out to William many times but got no answer, the only words that left his mouth were very faint and clearly not for me to hear.\n\n“why are you up at this hour William? And why are you looking into the distance like that?” I asked, trying to remain calm and hopeful but in truth, I knew what he was looking at and speaking with, the devil, it has come for him.\n\n“It’s john! He is alive and even found water, but he says you and the others can’t be trusted…don’t fret, I’ll talk to him and convince him to bring us all to the water.” William finally answered my calls, clearly delirious from dehydration and lack of sleep.\n\n“have you gone mad? We’ve seen his corpse William, he is dead! Whatever you heard isn’t real so just go back to sleep and try to ignore it.” I tried to be the voice of reason, what was I supposed to say otherwise? That the devil is trying to lure him into his grasp? That it is the same creature that butchered John in the first place? I feared that saying such things would only agitate him more, but I too was foolishly mistaken for what was beckoning him into the darkness was no devil, it was something far worst.\n\nSuddenly I too heard the voice of John reverberating through the forest, it called out to me, it told me that we were saved, that he had water and had even found a way out of the jungle. I could not believe it, I knew John was dead, I have seen his remains with my own eyes but there he was, talking to me from the darkness, however, something felt wrong with his words.\n\nIt was as if he spoke through a heavy cloth or mask, his voice was a little muffled and he took deep rapid breaths often as if the mere act of speaking was taxing on him.\n\nI was left speechless and confused, I thought that I was perhaps mistaken about John’s death, the only way we could tell that corpse was his was due to the musket and clothing, but those could’ve easily been stolen or given away in barter.\n\nI now realize how foolish it was to even consider, but the weariness of many sleepless nights and near-unquenchable thirst clouded my judgment.\n\nWilliam, no longer able to resist the temptation, ran into the darkness, leaving the warmth and safety of the fire behind him. I panicked and quickly followed after him, trying to navigate the thick, dark creases of the jungle using nothing but the sound of his hurried footsteps and quickening breathing to guide me.\n\nI followed as far as I could before reaching a clearing where William stood, illuminated by nothing but the faint blueish hue of the moon. He looked around frantically, calling for John, asking him if he was okay and where the water was. he pleaded and begged, directing his voice everywhere but got no answer, the muffled words of John have gone silent.\n\nI was unwillingly hidden behind a wall of luscious thick brush and trees and before I could come out of my hiding and call out to William, I saw something that put the fear of god within me. The devil, the beast which stalked us since we set foot in this god-forsaken jungle was now in view. Its horrifying visage was only slightly illuminated by the moonlight, yet it was enough to make me soil myself.\n\nIt was tall, too tall for anything that stands on two legs, yet so skinny and weak looking it appeared to be malnourished. Its skin was grey and loose as if it was an overgrown gown he fashioned out of countless bodies. it had the legs of a goat and the hands of a human, but they were adorned with claws big enough to tear a horse in half with ease, the most horrifying part of it however, the one that made my body shiver the most, was its face. because his face was just that of John, stuck in a permanent expression of utter terror.\n\n“William, come a little closer, I’m right here.” The thing spoke, but its mouth did not move, it remained open ajar yet words still came out of it somehow. its dead eyes darted from side to side in anticipation, waiting for the unaware William to step close enough.\n\nHe could not see the evil from where he stood, and I was so gripped by fear that I could not even muster enough courage to warn him. I was simply frozen in place, musket in hand, watching a man I knew walk into the grasp of that unholy creature.\n\nOnce William came close enough, the creature revealed himself, and it only gave him enough time to scream for god’s help before disemboweling him with his massive claws.\n\nWilliam hit the ground, his expression now matching the one on the face of John, the one the creature wore as his own. the thing knelt down and a long-barbed tongue slithered out of its mouth. It moved as if it had a mind of its own as it flayed and consumed certain parts of William, starting with his face and brain before cracking open his chest with ease and tearing his lungs apart.\n\nEscape may have been the better option I know, but the creature was too preoccupied with his hellish feast and so I thought about ending him there and then. I was afraid, so dreadfully afraid but I still sluggishly aimed my musket at it, using the thick brush to hide the barrel from its dead eyes.\n\nAs I prepared to take the shot a breeze pushed past me, carrying my scent right to the creature. It quickly stopped its feeding and retracted its disgusting, snake-like, tongue back into his body, and started looking around, trying to spot me.\n\nHe stood back up on its hind goat legs and spoke in many voices, most in languages I did not understand nor even recognize. Some sounded like the cries of children, others like the wailing of women, but as soon as his dead, corpse-like eyes spotted me, those words turned into an incoherent demonic screeching and he started running on all fours towards me with terrifying speed.\n\nThe fear of facing a gruesome death finally outweighed my fear of that hellish monster and I managed to muster enough strength and focus to squeeze the trigger of my musket, thinking that it was the end for the monster.\n\nTo my utter surprise and horror, the musket exploded, sending burning gunpowder and wood shrapnel flying out of one end, and the musket ball flying out of the other.\n\nSearing pain assaulted me as I fell to the ground, and my eyes could see not but darkness. The last thing I heard before my consciousness left me was the pained screams of that demonic creature getting further and further away.\n\nIt has been 3 days since my encounter with it, at least that’s what Chima tells me. I have been rendered nearly blind by that faulty musket. My left eye is completely gone, but I can still see out of my right if something is right next to my face.\n\nLight pains me greatly, I can’t open my right eye in the morning or even next to a fire come nightfall. Even under the moonlight, I can only keep it open for a measly minute before the pain becomes too much to bear. It has taken me hours to write this entry, and I fear that there aren’t any others to come.\n\nChima was the one to rescue me, “Richard, go away, find people” she said. Luckily, she managed to find a small lake and made camp for the two of us near it. the source of water we’d been looking for was so close to us. If only William hadn’t fallen for the creature’s trickery.\n\nShe goes hunting during the day and keeps guard during the night. I am lucky no beast has eaten me while she’s away, but perhaps there is a reason for that beyond luck. A reason why she found water so quickly when we struggled to find a drop, a reason why no predator dares come close to our camp.\n\nI have been fed and given water whenever I asked, and no harm has been done to me thus far, but I somehow know that if I were to open my eyes and look at her face, I’d see a horrified expression frozen in time staring back at me.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nQuite the dreadful tale isn’t it? but I know what you’re thinking, this creature is no more dangerous than a wild animal. Well, you are perfectly correct. I do not know why this creature is classified the way it is. My family was annihilated before I was let in on many of the really big secrets.\n\nBut I do know one interesting fact about the story of Thomas Clarke, he returned to retain in 1747 completely healthy and unharmed, only to disappear soon after. I do not know much beyond that but it is certainly interesting.\n\nI feel better now that I can share some of my knowledge with the world, even If I’m going to be laughed at by those who receive it, but I still must thank them for gifting me this serenity.",

The 308 was hitting with much more kinetic force then my 40 caliber pistol. It was putting them down and keeping them down. An empty magazine hit me right in the face as Mairo continued the onslaught. A thought popped into my head from one of the firearms instructors, *Pistols put holes in people, rifles put holes through people.*\n\nAs another magazine hit my face, Mairo yelled, “I’m out.” He grabbed me by the collar of my shirt and with what seemed like no effort at all, he picked me up and said, “ Marine, we are leaving.”\n\nHe shoved me toward the cook shanty. I looked out over the area between me and the elevator. There were over three dozen Wiowalks laying on the ground with the back of their heads blown out. I was so shocked that I stopped running and just stood there, mouth agape. Mairo ran up, shoved me, and shouted, “Unless you are trying to catch a flying rooster in your mouth, close it and keep moving. We are not done with this fight.”\n\nI looked closer and saw at least thirty more crawling out of the mineshaft and coming towards us. In its mad dash to get to us, one of the Wiowalks crashed into a telephone pole, snapping it like a toothpick and knocking out the power to all buildings.\n\nI ran though the double doors gasping for air. Mairo looked like he wasn’t even breaking a sweat. He spun around and was trying to figure out how to lock the door. In a move of sheer genius, Mairo took his rifle and put it between the two pull handle loops on the door. He disconnected his rifle sling, wrapped it around the handle for good measure and tied it off. The door began to shake and groan as the Wiowalks tried to push their way into the building. The sound of cracking plastic could be heard as the polymer frame began to bend and flex. After a brief moment the sounds stopped.\n\nI whispered to Mairo, but in my current state it came out as a shout. “Do you have any more ammunition for that rifle?” Mairo looked at me, cupped his hands around my ear and said,\n\n“If I did, I would not be using it as the world's most expensive door lock.” I gave him a shrug that meant ‘Ok fair point.’ “We need to clear this building of hostiles,” Mairo said.” I gave him a thumbs up.\n\nUnder the glow of emergency lights that cast everything in erie long shadows, we walked over to the first door we saw. Mairo pointed at me and gave me the number one sign and pointed to go right. He then pointed at himself, made a number two sign and pointed to the left. I nodded my head in acknowledgment, unholstered my pistol and had it in the low ready. Mairo opened the door and stood to the side. I went in first and turned right with Mairo close on my heels as he swung left. We cleared the kitchen attached to the cook shanty. We did this for each door we came up to. Most of the rooms on the other side were small closets. One of the doors led outside, but luck was on our side as no creatures were around so we immediately retreated back into the cook shanty.\n\n“Last door.” Mairo said as he opened the door. I rushed in and hooked right, my weapon light activated. I saw a man sitting in a chair behind a desk. It looked like he was sleeping. I fell back on my training and without even thinking I yelled,\n\n“Sheriff’s department, show me your hands. Do it! Do it NOW!”\n\nMairo grabbed the guy out of the chair and put him on the ground. I holstered my pistol and went hands on, putting my knee next to his elbow and moved his right hand to the small of his back. I placed my other knee and leg across his back on the shoulder blade and grabbed his other hand. Holding both of his hands in one of mine, I reached on my belt for cuffs. A surge of panic washed over me when I could not find them. Then I remembered that I don’t carry them anymore. I looked up and saw Mairo smiling at me like a lion proud of his cub taking down his first gazelle.\n\n“Mario, restraints,” I demanded. The former Gunnery Sergeant handed me a roll of duct tape. With Mario’s help, we tied the man up.\n\n”Dang, you jumped on that guy like fly on crap,” Mairo said.\n\n“Is he dead?” Mairo asked.\n\n“No, he's drunk. Passed out. I've seen it before. Also, the trash can is full of empties, which was a dead give away. He's breathing and also has no wallet or ID. We just need to wake him up.”\n\nMairo cracked a grin and said, “Well Deputy, would you like to do the honors?” The grin was contagious, I could feel one of my own forming on my face. I put my hands up in mock surrender.\n\n“Oh no, no, no Gunny. The pleasure is all yours,” I said sarcastically.\n\nMairo let out a snort, “You know how many times I woke up to lance corporals doing this? Way, way too many.”\n\nWith the stranger sitting up in the chair, Mairo closed his fist and placed his knuckles firmly against the man’s sternum and vigorously started to rub. After a few seconds the man let out a groan and his eyes fluttered open. He looked around in panic. As soon as he realized his arms were tied up, he started to hyperventilate. The light from an LED lantern we found was the only thing lighting up the room.\n\nThe man yelled, “I got to close the mine!”  \nMairo grabbed his shoulders to hold him still and got right in the man’s face. In a calm upbeat voice bordering on the edge of sounding like a psycho killer Mario asked, “Hey buddy, care to tell us what kind of grab ass goat rodeo is going on here today?”\n\n“My my my name is Mark. I own this mine. Now let me go. I have to close the doors to the mine. You don’t understand the danger we are all in.”\n\n“Yeeeeeaaaahhhhh, about that…… little late for that,” I said in a long sarcastic tone.\n\n“What time is it? Who are you people? Let me go.”\n\nMairo looked at his watch and said, “It's 1813 hours, and we are with the armored truck to pick up your cash.” With a quick wrist flick I opened up my pocket knife and was about to cut Mark loose.\n\n“Hold up Alex. Before you cut him loose, he needs to tell us exactly what is going on here and what those things are.”\n\nMark's eyes got as big as dinner plates. “You mean they got out?! Oh no, that’s not good,” Mark said anxiously. “Ok, so let me explain. When a man named George Ravenwood owned this mine, he did some bad things to good people. The land was cursed by a local Native American tribe. Demons called Wiowalks attacked everyone, so the surrounding towns came together and built the iron doors to seal the mine shut, but the curse remained after all these years. They hunt based on sound and if they come out into the sun, they turn to dust.”\n\n“How many are there?” Mairo asked.\n\n“Ummmm, I don't know, probably sixty. They only come out at night so I lock up the mine before sundown and never get an actual count.” Mark replied.\n\n“Where are the other employees?” I asked.\n\nMark gave me a quizzical look. “Other employees? No, it's just me.”\n\n“No, there was a girl that was working in the ticket booth. She has blond hair and an athletic build,” I explained.\n\nMark looked at me, confused.\n\nI let out a sigh and mumbled, “Really nice rack.” Mairo perked up at that.\n\nMark looked at me in horror as the realization slowly sunk in. “Was there anyone else you saw?” Mark asked with a shakiness in his voice.\n\n“Yeah, one tall guy with a high and tight military haircut and one chick with the most emerald green eyes I’ve ever seen. I swear I’ve seen her before.”\n\n“Oh fudge me,” Mark exclaimed. “I hired some college students to give tours and something really bad happened.”\n\nWe cut Mark loose and he spent the better part of an hour explaining everything that happened and the horrific details.\n\n“You are a monster,” I proclaimed.\n\n“What, so they are ghosts? Ghosts are not real,” Mairo said.\n\n“You sent lead into the brain stems of demons but ghosts are where you draw the line?” I replied.\n\n“Yeah, it’s a matter of principle,” Mairo said.\n\n“That’s not…..but how….. you know what….. just whatever,” I said. “Wait just a second. If they hunt based on sound, why have they left us alone this time?”\n\n“I don’t know. There’s probably something louder outside,” Mark answered.\n\nMairo peeked out the window and said, “Well, there's your loud noise.”\n\nWe joined Mario at the window and saw about twenty of the Wiowalks swarming over our truck, trying to get at the loud diesel engine that was protected under armor plating.\n\nMark got closer to get a better look and said, “Perfect, we will just wait them out until morning. They will either go back into the mine or die in the sun. This calls for a drink. Mark walked over to the bookshelf and pulled a flask out from between two books and took a long pull. His hands were shaking the whole time. “You boys want to tie one over while we wait?”\n\nWhat time is sunrise?” I asked. Mark smacked his lips and tossed the flasked away. He was rooting around the cabinet under the bookshelf for more alcohol and came up with a bottle of Knob Creek.\n\n“It’s not until 7am or as you military people say Oh-Seven Hundred,” he said, giving a half assed salute. Mario turned from the window, pure anger radiating from him. I turned to respond,\n\n“Hey Mairo, it's cool, remember we don’t want to draw the attention of those things outside.” One of Mairo's eyes was twitching. He stomped up to Mark and said,\n\n“Oh……Oh…… Oh?! Oh is not a number, you mother jumper. Oh is the sound my wife made for three hours straight on our honeymoon. It’s zero…zero seven hundred.” Mairo continued on, his rage slowly subsiding. “And it doesn’t matter. The truck will run out of fuel in about three hours or so. We were going to fill up at that shitty little gas station at the edge…” I cut Mairo off.\n\n“Mark, is there a landline phone we can use to call for help if our cell phones don’t have service?”\n\nMark let out a hiccup and with a slight slur said, “Yeah, it’s in that cabin over there,” he said, pointing toward the window. Mairo started grinding his teeth like he was eating his own jaw.\n\n“You mean the cabin between us and the armored truck? The same armored truck swarming with those things around it?”\n\nMark had the bottle to his lips and gave a nod. In less time then it would take to describe it, Mairo lunged across the room and slammed Mark against the wall stunning him. Mairo even managed to grab the half drunk bottle of Knob Creek and hold onto it. In a deep growl Mairo threatened, “Listen here you rooster sucker, the bar of expectations is at the ground, yet here you are with an eff-ing shovel. I swear to heaven you must have two brain cells left and they are both battling it out for third place.”\n\nI was caught between helping Mark or just falling over laughing at Mario’s words. By the time I was ready to decide, Mairo was starting to wind down. “If you were one of my recruits, I would have you outside apologizing to the tree for its extra work to provide you with oxygen.”\n\n“Hey Gunny, you good man?” I asked, while trying to hold back my laughter.\n\n“Yeah, I’m good. Sometimes you gotta yell at stupidity extra loud,” replied Mairo.\n\n“That’s all well and good, but we need to find a way out of here. As soon as the truck runs out of fuel, our goose is cooked. Do you have your portable radio?”\n\n“No, I left it in the truck. What about yours?” Mario replied.\n\n“It’s at the bottom of a lake. It was attached to my vest.”\n\n“Hey, hey, hey. \\*Hiccup\\* I have an idea. Why don’t \\*hiccup\\* one of you like, ninja crawl over to the cabin and call for \\*hiccup\\* help.” Mark said in a drunken slur.\n\n“You know what Mark? I’m going to start calling you Baskin Robbins because you’re thirty-one flavors of messed up. You do know that, right?”\n\nI let out a snort and said, “It could be done if we were stealthy enough.”\n\n“Although the police will not \\*hiccup\\* come out this far last \\*hiccup\\* last time I called 911, the park ranger showed up. It is their jurisdiction.” Mark said.\n\n“No park rangers!” I blurted out.\n\nThe other two looked at me in confusion. I took a deep breath to calm myself.\n\n“No…no park rangers. Park rangers and I don’t get along very well. Mark sat down in the chair behind his desk and said,\n\n“Well, I know what I’m going to do. I’m going to sit back and relax with my favorite drink and listen….to you two figure out a solution to this problem.” Mairo grabbed the bottle of bourbon from Mark's hand. He took a pull and smacked his lips and then handed the bottle to me. I shrugged my shoulders, took the bottle and said,\n\n“When In Rome.” The harsh liquid burned my esophagus as it made its way down to my stomach. I started to cough. Between coughs I said, “Smooth.”\n\nMairo and Mark both let out a little laugh. “We need to assess what we have available to use. Look for what is going to help us implement and improve our odds of escaping,” Mario announced. “Everyone empty their pockets.”\n\nMairo and I started laying everything out on the desk. Amidst the pile there was a pocket knife, wallet, and keys. Suddenly, Mario started to grin. “Lookie lookie what I got here.” He held up a silver device about the size of a thumb drive.\n\n“You got the dead man switch alright Gunny.” I let out a “Hoo-Ah!”\n\nMario looked at me and sighed while he pinched the bridge of his nose. “Hoo-Ah is Army, Oo-Rah is the Marines and Ouch, I got a papercut for the Air Force.”\n\nMark butt in, “Hey, hey, I got \\*\\*hiccup\\*\\* questions. Not to sound stupid, but,” Mairo cut him off,\n\n“Too late for that Burgundy Cherry, but what’s your question?” Mark completely ignored the insults and continued on.\n\n“What is the dead man switch?”\n\nI spoke up, “Without getting too deep into all the security components of an armored truck, the dead man switch is a device that protects against hijacking. If the truck is driven too far away from the device, the truck will shut down, lock the doors and call the police. However, with no cell phone service, it will not call the police.”\n\n“With that in mind, I have an idea.” Mairo said\n\n**One hour later**\n\n“Let’s go over it one last time,” Mairo said. “I will take the dead man switch far enough away that it shuts the truck off. Alex, you and Green Mint Stick will make your way over to the elevator control shack and turn on the generator. Peppermint Fudge Ribbon here will ride it down and make a bunch of noise to draw Wiowalks away and down into the mine. Then Alex will stop the elevator half way down the shaft.”\n\nMark spoke up, “Then I just wait until morning and ride the elevator up and push all the Wiowalks up with it until they hit sunlight and BAM they are all dead. I still don’t see why I have to be the one in the elevator.”\n\nI replied with, “One it’s our truck, and two, it’s your mine so it’s your problem. Three, someone has to stay and switch the elevator back to manual operator because the down button doesn’t work. And finally, number four, we are the ones with the guns.”\n\n“Once Lemon Sherbet is in the elevator shaft, Alex will walk to the truck and I’ll circle back and we will ride off into the night,” Mario finished.\n\nWe made our way to the door. Mark grabbed a cast iron pan and a large soup ladle to make noise with. Mairo untied the rifle strap and pulled the rifle out from the door handle. It looked beat up, but was in working condition for the most part. Mairo silently made his way toward the woods, while Mark and I made our way to the mineshaft opening and the shack holding the generator and controls. We primed and got the generator ready. Mark handed me a set of walkie talkies. As I stepped outside, I could see the Wiowalks all over the truck. *It’s going to be hard to explain the new scratch marks and missing paint,* I thought to myself. The faint rumbling of the truck ended with a spudder and cough. The dark, still, silence was only broken by the occasional scratching sound of claws on metal accompanied by a hiss.\n\nI walked inside the small shack and closed the door. Mark fired up the generator and the elevator's control systems came to life. Mark handed me a set of big puffy headphones for hearing protection. My hearing was almost back to normal and I did not want to ruin it again.\n\n“Here are the controls.” Mark said in a shout. “This is the elevator manual override lever. Once engaged, the only way to control the elevator is in this building.” He pointed to a display screen with a long rectangle representing the elevator shaft and a square that represented the elevator itself. He put a piece of tape in the middle of the rectangle. “Stop the elevator here,” he said, pointing to the tape. “That’s the halfway point, make sure you throw this lever.” He pointed to the lever that said ‘Override.’ “That will give me control of the elevator again, otherwise I can’t use the control in the elevator itself. Alright let’s go.”\n\nMark stepped into the elevator, yelled, “Wait one second.” He ran behind the generator, knocking over a large set of bolt cutters. He returned with a three liter bottle of Jack Daniels. Mark walked past me, patting the bottle and said, “Can’t forget Uncle Jack.” I shook my head in utter disbelief, but remembered that addiction is a power thing. I started to slowly lower him down. I could hear the clanging of the soup ladle against the pan.\n\nMark came on over the radio, “Ok, drop me down. I got their attention.” The humming of the generator was quickly drowned out by the sound of running feet and hands thudding against the ground. I watched on the screen as the elevator quickly descended. I stopped at the halfway point. A few moments later the elevator dropped a little and the screeching sound of metal on metal could be heard. I ran over to see what it was just as the radio cracked to life. “Everything good up there?” Mark said over a wave of static. The sound was the brakes pressing against the brake disk. It was holding, but any major bump would cause the brakes to slip just a little.\n\nI replied with, “10-4 the brakes are struggling to hold the weight of the elevator and the Wiowalks. Just try to not move around so much.” I monitored the brakes for a few more minutes and radioed in. “Ok Mark, I’m going to switch it over to manual now.”\n\nI was just about to throw the lever into manual mode when the door suddenly flew into the room, and I mean flew. It snapped the hinges and the locking mechanism in one go. In front of me stood a Wiowalk breathing heavily and looking like it was here for revenge. It had a cut along its cheek where my bullet had grazed it before. Visible bruises and welts could be seen where it was tackled by its compatriots. I quickly pulled my pistol out. I defaulted to my training and activated my weapon light, setting it to strobe, trying to disorient the charging creature.\n\nI fired as the creature ran towards me with pure hatred. It was ignoring the sound coming from the mine shaft and apparently went out of its way to find me. I fired once and then a second time, not aiming for the head, but getting shots on center mass. The slide on my pistol locked back just as the Wiowalke slammed into me. My gun skidded out of view and before I could get to my feet I was picked up and thrown across the room. I landed by the big spool of elevator cable. The Wiowalk was seeing nothing but red, or I guess in this case, hearing nothing but red. It charged at me and got entangled in the myriad of hoses, cables, and other elevator parts. The Wiowalk tried to reach for me, and I was stuck in the corner unable to move. Fortunately I was just a few inches out of reach. I looked around for a weapon, and remembered that I had my pocket knife. I pulled out my Smith and Wesson border guard knife and tried my best to stab the hand. I got two stabs into the palm when the creature’s hand wrapped around the blade and pulled it from my grasp. I heard it clatter to the ground in front of me. Then, I saw the bolt cutters that were knocked over. They were just out of reach, but I had an idea.\n\nI yelled, “Hey asshole! Yeah, you with the face! Come get me!” This enraged the Wiowalk. I don’t know if it was just the noise from me talking or the words themselves that were spoken, but the Wiowalked doubled its effort to get me. As soon as both arms came through the rubber hydraulic hoses, I ducked down and lunged in an awesome move that I probably could not do again if my life depended on it, which in this case it did. I grabbed the bolt cutters, did a somersault and landed on my feet. I spun and dove towards the Wiowalk’s hands. The head of the bolt cutters landed inside the creature’s wrist. I pushed down on the levers, cutting off one of the oversized hands with a sickening crunch.The demon from hell hissed and bucked as black oily blood squirted from its missing hand. I wound up the bolt cutters like it was a baseball bat and I need a grand slam to win the World Series. I swung for all I was worth making contact with the Wiowalks jaw. As it separated it from his body, I could hear skin being torn. The creature fell on the ground. I raised the bolt cutters over my head and repeatedly brought it down onto its face over and over again. I stumbled my way over to the control and started to panic when the override lever was snapped. The brakes were starting to strain. I got on the radio,\n\n“Mark the control lever is broken in half. I can’t give you control.” With a rush of static I heard,\n\n“Pull me up, pull me up!”\n\nI replied, “I’m trying the elevator motor. I don't think it can take the weight.” I paused for a few seconds and heard a creaking sound. “Mark the brakes are failing dude. I’m so sorry.” The sound of fishing line being unspooled grew loud as the elevator picked up speed and free fell into the bottom of the shaft, with Mark still inside. In shock I looked around until I found my pistol. I reloaded it with my last magazine and found my pocket knife. I walked out of the elevator room using the bolt cutters as a makeshift crutch. I started to close one of the iron doors when Mairo came pulling up in the armored truck. He turned the truck off to lessen our noise as he said,\n\n“Hey, where is Cherry Macaron?”\n\nI looked up at him and my face said it all, “He didn’t make it.” We closed the heavy iron door, wrapped the chain around it and locked it. None too soon had we finished that banging could be heard coming from the heavy iron doors.",

        "text": "[What happened before.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10rrr6j/on_the_day_i_turned_18_i_inherited_a_spellbook/)\n\n*This Book contains the Record of the House Viator, Walkers and Travelers, born under the shadow of Bright Io, Keepers of the Door.* \n\nThat was the inscription on the first page of the red book. I didn’t have the foggiest fucking idea what any of it meant. I put down the book; somehow, turning to the next page felt lit it was a massive step I wasn’t willing to take yet. \n\nMy parents were still sitting in the kitchen though they weren’t talking much. I got the impression they were listening or maybe just waiting for me to come back. The clock on my nightstand said it was nearly five in the morning. I pulled my phone from my pocket just to double-check the time, then slipped it back. I was stalling.\n\nThe book felt heavier when I picked it up again and turned the page. I stared at the symbols in front of me for a long time. They were…nonsense. Like wingdings, squiggles and random lines and swirls with no clear meaning. The marks seemed almost alive, changing in small, subtle ways as I watched. I took a breath and concentrated. \n\nSlowly, so slowly, they began to swim into focus.\n\n*Ours is the distance and the path, all doors are our doors. When you walk with us all. No way is closed to you. The first gift of Viator is this: mark an opening, hold your destination firmly in your mind, then open the Door.* \n\nUnder the brief caption was a simple drawing of a rectangle. \n\n“What the Hell kind of spellbook is this?” I muttered, getting ready to turn the page.\n\nI hesitated. The paper felt heavier than it should as if it was made of something much denser than pulped-up wood. I grunted, put my shoulder into it, and managed to flip the page. \n\nThe book shivered in my hands. \n\n“Shit,” I yelled, dropping it on the floor.\n\nAfter catching my breath, I leaned over from where I was sitting on my bed and looked down. The book lay open on my rug. The page it was turned to only had a single sentence written in the same spidery script as everything else I’d read. \n\n*Only the worthy deserve the Book of the Traveller; the Call has gone out and they will come.* \n\nThere was a knock at the door. \n\nMy parents stopped their whispered conversation in the kitchen. I heard a chair slide back then stop. \n\n“Don’t,” my mom said loud enough for me to hear clearly from my bedroom.\n\nThe knock came again.\n\n*Knock. Knock…knock.*\n\nI scooped up the book from the floor and opened my door. Or, I tried to, but the door was stuck. \n\n“Mom,” I said quietly. “Dad?”\n\nThere was a loud thud, then another, and then a crash. My dad yelled out. \n\n“Hey,” I shouted, pounding on the door. “What’s happening?!”\n\nI heard more yelling and commotion from within the house and then silence. My mom’s voice came back to me clearly in the quiet. \n\n“You can’t have him,” she said. \n\nThe lights went out a moment later. That’s when the screaming started. \n\n“No, no, *nononono*,” I yelled, banging on the locked door. “Dad! MOM!”\n\nThe book shivered again in my grip, slipping away. It dropped to the floor and I heard the pages flipping in the dark. They stopped. Shaking, I pulled my phone from my pocket and turned on the flashlight, pointing at the book, which lay open. \n\n*He can’t take me from you. No one can. You have to surrender me. Don’t.*\n\nI stared at the words on the page. The red book was talking to me.\n\n“What’s happening?” I whispered. “Who is out there?” \n\nThe book snapped closed. I heard the lock on my bedroom door click open. I’m not sure how it got locked in the first place. The house was dark and silent as I crept out into the hallway, phone held in front of me, its light looking weak and watery as I swept it back and forth. \n\n“Mom?” I whispered. \n\nThere was something on the walls. It was red and I almost screamed at first, thinking it was blood. But when I really looked I could see it was incredibly thin and solid. \n\nThread. \n\nI brushed my hand against the material, ripping it back when I felt pain. The threads were razor sharp. \n\n“Mom? Dad?” I called out, louder now, moving down the hallway toward the kitchen. \n\nI didn’t care if someone had broken into the house; I just wanted to see my parents. And then I saw them, stitched together, and I would have screamed if I was able to do anything at all. \n\nMom and dad were strung out together, little red threads piercing them everywhere. They hung together like broken dolls pinned to the living room wall, hundreds of those threads pushing into their skin, their eyes, and wrapped around their throats so tight that the wire had cut deep. So deep that it explained all of the blood on the floor.\n\nI shined my phone’s light on them and then around them, at first not able to understand, then refusing to believe, and then finally the screaming came. \n\n“I’ll give you a minute,” a voice said from the darkness.\n\nI whipped around but no matter where I swung the light, the living room seemed empty. \n\nExcept for mom and dad. \n\n“Did you do this?” I asked, forcing words out ahead of the vomit that was knocking. “Did you kill them?”\n\n“Yeah,” the unseen voice replied.\n\n“*Why?*”\n\n“They didn’t want to let me in.”\n\nNow that I was paying attention, I noticed the voice sounded young, probably female, and…almost bored? Like a cat getting tired of swatting a mouse around. Anger came up, climbing over the fear, and I suddenly had the distinct desire to push my thumbs through this asshole’s eyes. \n\n“I’m going to kill you,” I said, clutching the red book.\n\n“Probably not,” the voice said from the opposite side of the room. “Give me the book and I’ll let you die fast and easy like your parents. They barely suffered. I mean, they did a little bit but they shouldn’t have been rude.” \n\nSomething stabbed my ankle. I stumbled back, pointing my phone’s light down at the floor. A dozen tiny red threads were slithering toward me. There was a dot of blood between the cuff of my pajamas and my barefoot where one of the threads had already taken a taste.\n\n“You don’t know how much I can make it hurt if I want to,” the voice called out, close now. \n\nAnother stabbing pain in my other leg, much worse this time. I jumped away, putting a hand against my calf. It came back wet with blood. Several threads got me that time. I continued backing away, trying to come up with an idea, a way out. But all I kept thinking of was my mom and dad stitched to the wall with hundreds of those angry red threads.\n\nThe grief was overwhelming, but only for a moment. Then the hate I felt gave me a moment of clarity. A page from the book came roaring in to fill the silence. \n\n*Ours is the distance and the path, all doors are our doors. When you walk with us all. No way is closed to you. The first gift of Viator is this: mark an opening, hold your destination firmly in your mind, then open the Door.* \n\nI backed up until I hit the wall. Something giggled in the dark. \n\n“Nowhere to go. Now, where should we start? I’ve always been fond of the eyes.” \n\nI heard the rustle of the threads moving toward me but I didn’t rush. There was no time to try again if I made a mistake. I reached down to my leg for more blood, then turned and sketched four lines behind me in the shape of a crude rectangle. It was done in one continuous motion, fast but precise, maybe four feet tall by two feet wide. \n\nBig enough for me to fit through if it worked. \n\n“What are you doing?” the voice asked, sounding like it was barely a yard away. “Wait, are you-”\n\nI pressed my bloody palm into the center of the rectangle, focusing on the first place other than home that came to mind. For a terrible second, nothing happened. Then the drywall began to flex under my hand, becoming softer, first like sand, then like water, and then I was falling through an opening while the murderer’s voice shrieked behind me. \n\nWhen I looked back, there was no door, no sign of my house at all. There was only the familiar road leading from Elm Street to the small library where I spent so much of my time. The image in my head when I panicked and pushed through was turtles floating in a tank. \n\nThe library is closed at night. I’ve been sitting in the woods a hundred yards away since I fell through, trying to figure out my next step. \n\nMom and dad…\n\nI can’t think about them without getting sick. Without hating myself for not listening. They died because somebody wanted the book. Maybe I should just give it up. But if I do, how can I make their killer pay for what they did? How can I hurt them without this?\n\nI don’t know if I should go to the police. Would they believe me? Could they help me even if they did? \n\nFor now, I’m going to sit here leaning against this cold tree until sunrise, watching to see if I was followed. Then I’m going to call Hazel. In the meantime, I’m updating my post just to continue the record in case…fuck…*fuck*.",

        "text": "The small town of Ravenswood was plagued by a terrifying creature, known as the Dogman. It was said to be a creature that was half-man half-dog, with glowing red eyes and razor-sharp teeth. It was a creature of legend, but the people of Ravenswood knew it to be all too real. It had been attacking and killing their livestock for months, and the town was in a state of crippling fear. \n\nThe citizens couldn't go one night, without hearing the next dawn, of one of their own being picked away in the night. \n\nWho among them they always wondered, could stand against such a terrifying scourge. This beast, this dogman, he'd proven to be too much even for the police to handle. That is, until one man decided to stand from the crowd.\n\nJack, a young man known for his bravery and hunting skills, decided that he was going to put an end to this, but he couldn't do it alone. So, he gathered a team of the best hunters he could find in the town, far and wide, having displayed their skills in a test in a game hunt, and set out into the woods to hunt the Dogman.\n\nAs they entered the woods, the atmosphere was eerie and the air was thick with tension. On all sides the trees around them were thick, close together, boxing them in. Looking around, each and every one of them they knew there was no getting out of this forest. There was no turning back. Only they, or the dogman would be leaving alive.\n\nThey knew they were facing an extremely dangerous creature and they were aware this may be their very last game hunt. They set up camp and began to track the Dogman. They searched for days, but it was as if the creature had vanished into thin air.\n\nOne night, as they sat around the campfire, discussing their next move, they heard a blood-curdling howl in the woods. They knew they had found their target. But where? That sent a chill down their spines. They quickly packed up camp and set out to track the howl.\n\nAs they followed the howl deeper into the woods, the trees grew thicker and the darkness more intense, they knew that they were getting close. Suddenly, they came across a clearing and in the center of the clearing stood the beast. It was even more terrifying than the legends had described. It stood on its hind legs, towering over the hunters, and it's glowing red eyes locked on it's prey.\n\nEach of the men stood, despite each of them being hardened men, one's that had seen the likes of vile and rabid game, they had never before seen something so terrifying, so gargantuan, so tyrannical as the Dogman that stood before them now. They could feel, each of them, this thing's burning red eyes peering straight through their corneas, straight through their brains and into their hearts.\n\n\"That's it,\" said Jack, his heart pounding in his chest. \"That's the Dogman.\"\n\nThe hunters raised their weapons and prepared to fire, but the Dogman was too fast. With lightning speed, it charged at them, its razor-sharp teeth bared, ready to rent flesh from bone, without even a single worry of them dolling . The hunters fired, but their bullets seemed to have no effect on the creature.\n\n\"We have to take it down, now!\" Jack shouted.\n\nThe hunters fought bravely, but they were no match for the Dogman. It was far too strong, far too fast, and just far too ferocious. Jack was thrown into the ground, and he thought that it was the end for him. He watched as two of his other companions had been slammed into a tree, instantly crushing their skulls to paste. The third, oh the third. Jack watched in horror, as he, all he could do, as the Dogman lifted the poor bastard by his head, and ripped it clean from his shoulders, dowsing the both of them in warm metallic crimson. \n\nJack had all but given up hope, there was nothing he could do. His men were dead and the Dogman would have him next. The Dogman approached, the ground quaking in fear with every step he took forward. Snarling, the Dogman opened it's mouth.  \n\nSuddenly, Jack remembered something his grandfather had told him. He remembered the legend of the Dogman and how it may be defeated, for, like many creatures of native lore, they all bore a very distinct weakness to silver.\n\nWith a surge of strength, Jack rose to his feet and pulled out a silver knife. The Dogman turned to face him, snarling defiantly, and Jack plunged the knife into its heart with a furious roar. The creature let out a blood-curdling howl and fell to the ground, dead.\n\nJack stood, adrenaline forcing his heart to thump  and pound in his chest, harder than it ever could.\n\n\"We did it,\" Jack said, his voice shaking with emotion. \"the town is saved.\"\n\nHe returned to Ravenswood as a hero. He was greeted with cheers and congratulations from the townspeople. Jack went to see the Mayor to report what had happened.\n\n\"Jack, oh God, Jack, I can't thank you enough,\" the Mayor said, a look of relief plastered on his face. \"The Dogman has been terrorizing our town for too long. You've saved us all.\"\n\n\"It was my pleasure, sir,\" Jack replied grimly. \"But I couldn't have done it without the help of my men, God rest their souls.\"\n\nThe Mayor nodded. \"You're right. This is a team effort, they were brave men who gave their lives, and I want to make sure that everyone is recognized for their bravery. I will be holding a town meeting tomorrow to present  medals of honour to you and holding a commemorative memorial to the rest of your team.\"\n\nJack couldn't believe it. He had never thought of himself as a hero, but to the town he now was. He felt a sense of pride and accomplishment wash over him.\n\nBut their victory was short-lived, as they soon realized that the Dogman was not the only creature terrorizing the town. The legend of the Werewolf was also true and it had been seen recently in the forest. Jack knew he would have to act fast before it does any real harm to the town.\n\nHe set out again into the forest to hunt the Werewolf. This time, he was better prepared and he had silver bullets on hand for when the inevitable time would come to face down the beast. He searched for days, but the Werewolf was elusive. The Werewolf was far more agile than the Dogman before him.\n\nOne night, he sat around the campfire, pondering his next move, when just as with the Dogman, hauntingly familiar to him, a blood-curdling howl echoed through the forest. It was even more terrifying than anything he ever heard. It was a howl that would've even made the Dogman before shudder.\n\nAnd before he even knew what was happening, it's eyes, it's burning yellow eyes were fixed upon  him. The young hunter, the hero raised his weapon and fired. But the Werewolf was far too fast, bounding from treetop to treetop. From one, it bounded like a panther towards him, with it's teeth and claws bared. \n\nHe fired his silver bullets. After a few, perhaps three or four misfires, his aim came true, and the Werewolf let out a final howl, before crashing to the ground dead.\n\nJack felt a sense of relief wash over him. He had finally put an end to another terror that had plagued the town. He looked at it and he looked back towards the town, imaging the same relief in the eyes of the townspeople. He had done it once again.\n\nAnd as he made his way back to the town, he was once again greeted as a hero. The town threw a huge celebration in his honour, and once more the Mayor presented him with a medal of honour. Jack felt a sense of pride and accomplishment, but as he looked around at the townspeople, he couldn't help but feel a twinge of sadness. He knew that this was not the end. There would be other monsters out there, lurking, other battles he would have to fight. But for now, he was content to bask in the glory of his victory.\n\nAs days went by, Jack became known as the Monster Hunter of Ravenswood. He was called upon whenever there was any kind of creature, and kind of behemoth monstrosity terrorizing the town. And he always answered the call, ready to face whatever gargantuan behemoth that plagued the town.\n\nIn the years that followed, Jack faced many challenges, but he would always emerge victorious. He became a legend in his  own right, and his name were passed down through many generations of the town. \n\nBut for Jack, it was never about glory or fame. It was about protecting the innocent and keeping his community safe. And that was a duty he would always be willing to undertake, no matter the cost.\n\nAnd so, Jack continued to hunt monsters, his courage and determination never faltering, always ready to face whatever horrors lay ahead.",

        "text": "Okay, so I’m kind of on edge out right now because I just read [this story](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10vcx5u/i_saw_him_counting_backward_i_had_to_try_to_stop/) and now I’m wondering if I met the same dude but virtually. \n\nThis was back in the days when AOL would send you a CD like once a week in the mail begging you to install it and get 500 free hours of internet. \n\nI was 15, and my friends and I would stay up all night drinking my mom’s wine and jumping into whatever random chatroom we could find just to mess with people. Like, we’d pretend to be a 90 year old woman with a dog who had diarrhea and beg people for help. Sophisticated stuff, I know.\n\nBut then one day we’re in the middle of this big chatroom with a ton of people joining and leaving all the time. And we notice this user whose name is just a random bunch of letters and numbers, and every time someone joins the chat, he just posts descending numbers. 10. 9. 8. And finally he gets to zero and leaves. \n\nAs for that last account that entered just before the weird guy typed zero? Yeah, it went idle right away and eventually disconnected without typing a word.\n\nWeird, but nothing too crazy.\n\nExcept that a few days later, we hosted this LAN party in my basement with like 15 dudes to play Starcraft. And when we logged into the Battle.net room we noticed the same guy was already there. Now, this was supposed to be a private room, and we had no idea who the fuck this was. We tried asking, but he didn’t type a word.\n\nThen, as people finished setting up their computers and logging in, he started counting down from 10. Finally, when he got to one, I kind of held up my hand and asked the room if maybe we should stop, or find a new room or something. But everyone else told me to go fuck myself, and then Brian Lee logged into the room. \n\nAnd then he fell over, blood pouring from his nostrils. \n\nCould it have been a coincidence? Yeah, maybe. I guess I always wanted to think so. \n\nBut then when I saw that post a couple of days ago, it kind of freaked me out. Like maybe the Counting Man is real? \n\nBecause when that other poster described the man in the black suit, it kind of gave me to this flashback to Brian’s funeral. There was this super well dressed guy there, who looked vaguely sad. No one seemed to know who he was. And as the mourners walked into the church, I heard him counting down from 10. And when he got to zero, Brian’s uncle dropped dead, right on the threshold to the church.\n\nAfter that, I hadn’t had any encounters for years until I read that story. \n\nAnd then, a few hours later I’m in the comments something of some random thread on some memes forum, and I see him there, user 222cc34 or something like that. Counting down and people made their comments. And I just noped out of there without a word. To be honest, I’m pretty much ready to delete my account altogether and just go live in the woods where ten people never get together at once. \n\nBut… since that’s never gonna actually happen, I just kind of wanted to post here and see if anyone else has experienced anything like this or seen this guy around? Thanks in advance!",

        "text": "Everybody has problems they need to deal with.\n\nI bet if I asked my friends they would tell me a million things that I could fix about myself. And I could do the same to them. It's just the way we are as people, we all make mistakes. What sets us apart, however is how we react to advice on how to fix our mistakes in the future. You can be mature and listen to that advice by acting upon it, making yourself a better person in the process. Or you could be stubborn and not listen to the advice at all.\n\nAnd finally, you can be insane and listen while doing the complete opposite.\n\nI'd like to say I was mature, someone would tell me about a flaw in my character and I would work my hardest to rectify it. If I was wrong, I would try my best to make it right. But, I guess some people don't view the world the same way. You know, the type of people who think there is only one correct way, and it's their way.\n\nThe fact that I thought people were willing to change was a grave mistake of mine. I have a friend named Mathew, who everyone called Matt. We had been friends for a good 17 years, since the end of high school. He was funny and great company. But he had a problem.\n\nHe lied constantly.\n\nAnd I mean constantly. Even about the smallest things. When I first met him, I asked if he had any siblings, and he told me he was an only child. Later that year I found out that he had a younger sister. He would lie about what he did on the weekend, about what pets he had at home, stuff that was really inconsequential, that he didn't need to lie about. And yet he kept lying.\n\nAnd when confronted he would smile and shrug it off, as if it was just a joke and that I shouldn't off taken what he had said so seriously. And so I stopped really concentrating on what he said.\n\n*Just let him be.* I had thought. *He's not hurting anybody.*\n\nWell, Matt wasn't hurting anybody yet. You see, after time his lies would get worse. From little white lies that didn't have any value to big lies that, at best would screw with people, and at worst would ruin their lives.\n\nIt snowballed from \"I went to that Coldplay concert on the weekend.\"\n\nAnd went to, \"I saw that bitch Jessica fucking David in that back alley behind the cinemas.\"\n\nJessica's boyfriend wasn't too happy with that.\n\nAfter 4 chipped teeth, 2 cracked ribs, severe facial tearing and mild brain haemorrhaging, David was finally released from hospital. Luckily he was able to get back on his feet, but the doctor's said he would never be able to move as fast as he used too. Goodbye scholarship.\n\nIt was proved later that what Matt had said, was in fact a lie. When he was confronted about it he played it down and got away scot-free. I could see something was wrong with Matt, and yet I still let him be. I was worried of course, but I didn't know how to bring it up. How do you tell one of your best friends that they may have severe mental problems?\n\nSo I let it go.\n\nI was moving states after all. I kept in touch with him, visiting him when I went back home to visit my own family. We would go fishing or watch a movie. Just generally hanging out. As time went on, he seemed quieter, more withdrawn. More hesitant to speak about his personal life. I had taken that as a good sign. To me less talking meant less lying. Hell, he could even be going to therapy. And so we kept up that sort of relationship for 17 years.\n\n17 fucking years.\n\nI don't know how many people he had hurt since then, I don't even want to know. But I have some sort of idea. The grief occasionally wakes me up in the middle of the night.\n\n\"I could have stopped this.\" I would sob into my pillow. \"I could have done something.\"\n\nBut I never did. And it costed me dearly.\n\n\\-------------\n\nIt was early 2015. I was busy with work and life, and so I hadn't got to see my parents for a while. But then things changed. And when I finally booked my plane tickets I was giddy with excitement. I loved my parents and missed them. And I knew they would be excited to see their first grandson.\n\nI looked at my wife, Abby, who was holding little baby Marc, and smiled again. To me life was good, my job payed well, I had a beautiful wife and son, I was happy and content. And I couldn't wait to share my feelings with my parents. My mom especially would be overjoyed.\n\nShe had always told me, \"You need a good wife to ground you! Take your head out of the clouds, eh?\"\n\nI would smile and shake my head. \"Soon.\" I would say.\n\nAnd soon was now.\n\nMarc's first plane trip was uneventful, which surprised me. But probably relieved all the other passengers on that plane. We got off and spent a joyous few days at my parent's house, who loved to spoil little Marc to bits. We would talk and laugh, and it seemed to me Abby and her in-laws really clicked.\n\nThose were the last days I was truly happy.\n\nI had texted Matt for another catch-up. And he, of course, had said yes. We met at our usual spot. A really nice lake deep inside the bowels of Montana. It was a 40 minute drive to get there but as always, the conditions were perfect and the fish were biting.\n\nWe planned to stay there for about four hours, and during the middle of the session I managed to catch a massive Lake Whitefish. After congratulating me, Matt had told me he had one time caught a fish two times that size. I rolled my eyes at him. I, of course, knew what he was like. Upon noticing my reaction, he seemed kind of hurt, but nevertheless agreed to snap a photo of me holding the fish.\n\nOnce he finished taking the photos of me, he leaned forward to pass the phone back. And as he did, the boat suddenly lurched, causing Matt to roll to one side, and in turn drop my phone. We both watched in horror as the phone landed in the water with a *plonk!*\n\nMatt turned to me, \"Fuck! I'm so sorry Daniel! Honestly I didn't mean to do it!\"\n\nI laughed. \"It's ok Matt, I was looking to get it replaced anyways.\"\n\nHe began to laugh as well, but I could see the relief wash over his face. It was the truth, anyways. I couldn't be walking around with an i phone 8 anymore, it just wasn't practical. But then I had a thought.\n\n\"Oh!\" I exclaimed. Matt quickly turned to look at me. \"You better text Abby I'm not going to be able to text her anymore. Do you have her phone number?\"\n\nHe nodded in affirmation.\n\nI narrowed my eyes at him. \"You don't actually, do you?\" I questioned.\n\nHe sheepishly nodded again, so I told him her phone number.\n\n\"Yeah, you better explain the situation to her.\" I said. And when he pulled out his phone and started texting her, I casted out my line again.\n\n\\-------------\n\nOnce the sun started to set, I turned the boat around and we made our way back to where we had parked. I waved goodbye to him and left to my parent's house. After the drive, I walked up to the front door and knocked quietly, afraid that I might wake up Marc. The door opened slightly, and I saw my mother's face peek out.  She looked as if she had been crying. As soon as she saw me, she sped out and embraced me in a tight hug.\n\n\"I thought you were in trouble!\" She exclaimed. \"Oh, we were so worried!\"\n\n\"What?\" I managed to say.\n\nShe looked at me with a confused expression. \"You know, how you fell off the boat and drowned. Matt told us all about it. He said he was calling the park rangers to see if they could find you, but he warned us not to get our hopes up. I don't know how you managed to get out, but I'm so glad you did!\" And then she hugged me even tighter.\n\nAt this point I was even more confused. \"What exactly did Matt tell you?\" I said slowly.\n\n\"It doesn't matter now, you're home safe, that's all that counts.\" She whispered.\n\nShaking my head, I walked inside the house. \"Where's Abby?\" I called out to my mum.\n\n\"Oh, as soon as she heard the news she took our car and rushed to go see Matt at the lake.\"\n\n\"WHAT?\" I exclaimed. And turned around.\n\n\"Yeah, we're going to have to call-\" She began to say, but I had already made my way back to the car.\n\nI put my keys in the ignition and drove off as fast as I could. As I quickly made my way back to the lake,  trying to avoid an accident, the cogs began to turn in my head. I didn't know why Matt had told my parents that I had drowned, but Abby was going to the lake to *meet* him. Something was wrong, I could feel it. I reached into my pocket to call Abby, when I realised I didn't have a phone.\n\n\"Shit!\" I yelled out, and slammed my palm against the wheel.\n\nThere was no use turning back now, so I kept on driving. But then I noticed a jogger coming towards me, headphones on and listening to music. I pulled over and practically leaped out of the car. They saw me coming towards them and stopped with a worried look on their face. I held up both my hands as a sign of peace.\n\n\"Listen, I'll give you a hundred dollars if you can let me use your phone right now.\" I said.\n\n\"I don't know.\" The jogger said.\n\nI pulled out my keys. \"You can have these until I'm finished so you know I won't run away. Please!\" I pleaded.\n\nThe jogger took the keys from my hand and tossed me their phone. I thanked them and quickly opened up the phone app, and called Abby. No response. Cursing myself, I decided to call Matt. He answered surprisingly quickly.\n\n\"Hey, Daniel what's up?\"\n\n\"WHERE THE HELL IS ABBY?\" I shouted at him, causing the jogger to back away from me.\n\n\"Hey man, calm down. What are you talking about?\"\n\n\"What am *I* talking about? What are *you* talking about? You're the one lying about me drowning or some other stupid shit.\"\n\nHe was silent for a while before responding. \"...I'm don't lie, Daniel.\"\n\n\"My ass you're not! Now tell me the truth for once in your life, WHERE. IS. ABBY?\" I yelled again.\n\n\"Oh yeah! Her. Well it turns out the human body doesn't take kindly to a gunshot to the sternum. Just like I don't take kindly to being called a liar. Sorry about that. There was nothing I could do.\"\n\n\"Liar! Where the fuck is she?\" I said. But for once, I almost believed him. He sounded way to calm given the situation.\n\n\"I don't lie, Daniel.\"\n\nAnd then he hung up.\n\nI stared at my phone in disbelief for a couple of seconds before handing it, along with a hundred dollars, to the now very concerned jogger. I sped away into the night, rushing as fast as I could to get to the lake. I knew Matt was prone to lying, but at this point I was panicking, seriously fearing for Abby's life.\n\nThe trip seemed to last an eternity, every second was spent wondering if it was Abby's last. But, eventually I made it to the lake. Both Matt and my parent's car were parked at the front, confirming my suspicions. They were both here. I walked over to the main part of the lake to see if I could scout out anything. The lake was eerily calm, the water still and even the trees seemed not to rustle in the evening wind. My heart was in my throat, I was terrified of what could be happening, unseen by everyone including myself.\n\n*Where is she? Where is she?* I said to myself. *Come on, think man!*\n\nThen, out of the corner of my eye I saw a shape that shouldn't be there, at the end of the jetty. I focused my eyes on it, and the shape seemed to resemble something human-like, so I made my way over to it. As I made my way closer, some clouds moved past the moon, making my surroundings ever so brighter momentarily. And I ran because I saw who it was.\n\nAbby.\n\nShe was sitting in a chair, hands and feet bound to each other, causing her to sit in an awkward position. Her mouth was bound, and blood seemed to drip over every part of her body. Yet she was still breathing, her eyes looking at me pleadingly.  I came up to her and cried out in anguish when I located the source of the blood.\n\nA bullet wound. Clean through the sternum.\n\n\"What did he do to you? Abby I fucking swear I'm going to kill him!\" I cried out, while untying her knots.\n\nSuddenly her facial expression changed from worry to fear. And before I could react, I felt a hard shove on my back, the momentum carrying me over the jetty and into the water. The cold, tangy water quickly submerged me as I wrestled with my assailant. They had the upper hand, however, as they were on top of me, forcing me down ever deeper. I began to panic, and did the one thing I shouldn't have done in that situation.\n\nI swallowed.\n\nAs the water filled my lungs, I became light-headed and woozy. Shadows and shapes danced in front of my eyes, and I had a hard time discerning what was going on. Every fibre of my being was screaming at me to intake more oxygen, and yet I couldn't. My thrashing became weaker and as the energy slowly left my body, thoughts swirled across my head, cascading into an orchestra of noise.\n\n*I called him a liar.*\n\n*He said you had drowned.*\n\n*Abby had been shot in the sternum.*\n\n*I never lie, Daniel.*\n\n*I never lie.*\n\nMy body finally hit the bottom of the lake, causing me to awaken from my trance. I thrust my hands out to support myself on the sand, like one last-ditch effort before I gave up. However, my right hand came in contact with something, small and glass.\n\n*What is it?*\n\n*It's a...ah, I don't know.*\n\nI had a hard time collecting my thoughts, I was scared and lacked oxygen, but even then they culminated into an answer. I knew what it was now, a beer bottle. Mustering my strength, I swung the bottle as hard as I could onto my attacker. They recoiled, and the pressure release on my chest was almost instant. Feeling lighter, I began to swim to the surface as fast as I could.\n\nAnd let me tell you, after an experience like that, air has never felt better.\n\nI stayed stationary for a while, lapping up oxygen and regaining my strength. Before swimming my way back towards the shore. As I got to dry land, the earth began to sway and rock beneath my feet, as if I had just been on a boat. And then I felt bile rushing up my throat as I bent over and retched into the sand. I stood up again, wiping my mouth, and looking for Matt. And just as I was hoping, there was no sign of him. I must have hit him harder than I thought I did.\n\n\"Good fucking riddance to you, you bastard!\" I called out towards the lake. \"Drowning in the lake really suits you!\"\n\nRemembering Abby, I rushed towards the jetty again. Ever step felt like I was walking through mud. I made it to the end, and she was still there, sitting awkwardly in the chair. Except this time was different, her body was slumped over herself, she was still and she was cold.\n\nI fell to my knees, crying aloud. \"I was too late...she's gone!\"\n\nI curled into a fetal position, willing myself to die. There didn't seem to be much more to live for. I had lost my spark, my joy in this world. I couldn't go on any longer, I wouldn't have went on any longer if it wasn't for Marc. He needed a father. He needed me. And so I begrudgingly cut the ties that bound her and carried her lifeless body into my car, and sped away once more into the night.\n\n\\-------------\n\nIt's been eight years since then.\n\nThe police were called, but because of the lack of evidence they seemed to be most suspicious of me. But after a while they dropped the investigation and left me alone. I t was hard to pick up the pieces after Abby died. I felt like half of myself had been ripped off. I didn't know who I was anymore, what I could do. But therapy helped, and I feel much better about myself now. The grief is still there but I can cope.\n\nMarc has now a strong-minded nine year old. He's determined and adventurous. He doesn't let anything get in his way.\n\nHe's just like his mother.\n\nYesterday was actually the anniversary of her death. I spent it as I usually did, drunk and cursing Matt for everything. I get Marc to play outside with his friends when I'm under the influence, I don't ever want him to see me like this. I can promise you know, I will sober up and go to AA meetings. But for now, he can play outside.\n\nSo thats why I started to panic when I got a text from an unknown number.\n\n*Come quickly! Marc has just been in a hit-and-run accident! I've called an ambulance but I don't know if he's going to make it.*\n\nI leapt from my seat and quickly opened the blinds. And there was Marc, playing a game of catch with his friends. They were having fun and laughing with each other. There was no accident, they weren't even on the road. \n\n*Liar!* I texted back. *Who the fuck are you? What do you want?*\n\nThe reply was simple, but it was enough to chill me to the bone.\n\n*You know I never lie, Daniel.*",

        "text": "Working at Tesco’s was a pretty fun job. Something always happened. A shoplifter, a fight, a Karen or a baby left unattended. The majority of the day was spend screwing up my job miserably. Dropping expensive wines, placing things in the wrong isle and not being able to help customers due to social anxiety. It was okay though. I liked it when interesting things happened. Out of the ordinary. This experience was very out of the ordinary for sure. In a bad way.\n\nIt was maybe 1am and I was working a night shift. There were maybe 10 people working and around 25 customers. Everything was boring. I was stocking the dairy isle when I felt a presence behind me. I slowly turned round and some guy was starting at me. He looked... weird. Maybe he was on drugs or something. \n\n\"Hi, sir! Can I help?\" I politely asked.\n\nBut the man just kept staring. I was too socially awkward to ask him to stop staring at me so I spend the next 10 minutes with a stranger staring at the back of my head while I pretended like everything was good. When my stocking was over, I got up and walked to the store room so I could restock the cereal isle. I wasn't very slowly. My shoes don't make to much sound so I found it strange when foot steps followed me all the way there. Paying closer attention, I realised that the noise was coming from behind me. I looked over my shoulder and it was the same man huron the dairy isle. \n\n\"Can I help you?\" I asked once again. No reply.\n\nI sped into the storage room and took the back exit out. I walked back in through the double doors at the begging of the store. I went over to my work mate at the counter number 3. I explained what had happened with the man.\n\n\"Do you mean that one?\" She pointed to over my shoulder. \n\nI spun around and you'll never guess who was in line to buy stuff. He had duct tape and rope. Not weird at all. I signalled to the lady who i worked with. We'll call her Joanne for the purpose of this story. I signalled to her to ask the man why he was following me. She shook her head and turned to the man. \"Is that all for today, sir?\"\n\nHe nodded. First time he used any form of communication. \n\n\"So what will you be fixing with these items?\" Joanne asked. \n\nThe guy didn't respond. He just payed with cash.\n\n\"Would you like a receipt?\" She asked\n\nAgain, the guy didn't respond. He went to the end of the cage point and stared at me again. \n\n1:25am My shift ended. It was raining heavily outside. I was so pissed That I had to walk home in the rain. \"I can't walk home in that rain.\" I said, making sure the guy heard me. \"I'll get a taxi.\"\nI wasn't a convincing liar. I went to retrieve my bag from the locker. Sup rise. The guy followed me to the door.\n\nI grabbed my keys and did that thing were you place them between each finger, so that a punch would hurt. Badly. He followed me to the carpark. The best and quickest foot path was the on in the far end of the carpark. Being the dumb person I am I took it. \n\nIt happened. He grabbed me and started pulling me towards a caravan He opened the door and flung me inside. He opened a cupboard, tied my wrists above my head and taped my mouth. Yes, it was the stuff from the shop. He yelled at me to be quiet and slammed the door shut. The engine began but then, I heard the caravan door opening. I was struggling so hard to get out and trying to scream through the tape but it was no use. I was so distracted and fearful that I didn't care about the door opening. Then I heard a thud. The door opened as I began to cry.\n\nJoanne was standing there with two other members of the staff. They ripped off the tape and untied me. \n\nWe called the police and the man was arrested.If Joanne and the other people hadn't gotten there in time thenI don't know if I would be able to tell this story.\n\nThe guy was arrested and given 10 years in prison for attempted kidnapping. He's probably out right now. Be careful workings late shifts okay?\n\nI quit my job a few days later. Not because of the kidnapping but because I wanted more out of a job than tescos.\n\n\nThanks for reading :)",

        "text": "I think just about everyone active in the dating community has had the occasional experience with 'crazy eyes'. No, this isn't some cryptid who preys on the innocent single, looking to mingle or anything of the like; more of a condition than something paranormal or otherworldly, I suppose. \n\n  Male, female, gay, straight, somewhere in between, or as yet, undecided; there are crazy eyes in every community. They may seem so normal (if that's even a thing) when you first meet. Average conversation, maybe even some of those little mannerisms that drive you nuts; the biting of the lower lip, stroking the hair gently over an ear, wrinkling the nose with a smile. Those little things that invest your interest right off the bat. \n\n  Sometimes, it's not until it's a little too late before those eyes sell the actual truth of things. \n\n  More often than not, you can escape these encounters unscathed; maybe a few weeks of awkward text messages, or the occasional parked car on the other side of the road outside your house, but it generally doesn't last. Valentine's day of last year, though; that one that left me questioning if I will ever even attempt dating again.\n\n  My buddy, James, and I had come up with precautions for such things: a simple alert, locked and loaded before meeting a new prospective mate. We called it 'the abort code'. Silly and childish, yes, but we had both experienced more than our fair share of evenings out on the town that required some help to escape. \n\n  We would have the message, \"How's your mom and them?\" typed out before the evening's events would begin, ready to just hit send if things should go sideways. It was a natural enough conversation starter that shouldn't expose what was actually going on, should this be one of the more radically crazy types, who whip the phone from your hand, to make sure you weren't texting another girl or something. \n\n  Yes, that has happened before. On that occasion, I was technically messaging another woman; that being my mom, but even after explaining that to my date, Julia, or Jen, or something, she had to double-check. The night went downhill from there. This was before the abort code was a thing, so I just had to grin and bear it. \n\n  After that incredibly long night, James and I came up with this. We had been best friends since childhood, so we had a vested interest in one another's potential significant others. We never arranged dates on the same day, so we would be ready to assist the other, should anything go wrong. If we received the notification, it was time to spring into action. \n\n  The first step was a phone call, requiring a bit of acting on the part of the one in need of a bailout. There would be shock and maybe even tears, depending on how severe the crazy was, ending up with having to ditch the date to get to the hospital asap. \n\n  Most times, this was enough to get the job done. The insane person in question would sometimes offer to come along, to help soothe the weary and pain-stricken heart, wounded by whoever 'had been in a terrible accident', but not always. At the end of the day, even crazy people feel uncomfortable around someone suffering, especially if they've only recently met. \n\n  Should this not be enough to get the job done, step two would be set in motion if no 'all clear' was given within fifteen minutes. This would require acting on both sides, as we would have to show up in person; to attest to the validity of how grim the situation was. \n\n  This part would make just about everyone at the restaurant feel uncomfortable, as we would make a full scene from our dramatic performance. By the time our improvised play would reach its end, we would both be practically running for the door, leaving teary apologies in our wake. \n\n  The only downside to having to take things this far, is whatever restaurant or bar this would take place in, was now burned for at least a year. We couldn't risk inadvertently letting the regulars in on the act; not if we didn't want to blow our cover. \n\n  We only had to resort to this one time. Her name was Lucy or Lenore…definitely an L name, I think. She looked pretty embarrassed by the ridiculous performance we put on, as did just about everyone else around us, but it did the trick. She didn't even text the next day to check in, so I considered that a job well done. \n\n  Step three; the final step, would be an act of pure desperation. While we had been fortunate enough to never have to use this, we would carry some laxatives to every date. Whether we took it ourselves or had to essentially roofy our crazy dates would be dependent on the scenario; it hadn't yet been fully flushed out (sorry, couldn't resist). Either way, the results would be sure to stick a fork in things, or so we hoped. It was still just a working theory, after all. \n\n  Yes, this may be taking things a bit too far, but it's like they say: all's fair in love and war, right? That was good enough for me, anyway.  \n\n  So, it was about a week before Valentine's day, last year, when a work friend set me up with one of his sister's friends. Well, he was more of an associate, I guess. He had only worked there for a month or two, but he seemed a friendly sort. \n\n  I was resistant at first, being generally not a fan of hookups, but after he showed me the girl's picture, I was invested. Yes, call me shallow if you like, but she was gorgeous. Dark hair, dark skin, bright, green eyes, and a smile that could melt a glacier. \n\n  Perhaps, if I had allowed the idea that there had to be a reason that someone this breathtaking was still single, maybe I could have made better decisions that night. Unfortunately, my mind wasn't in charge at that time. Yeah, I'm a pig. I know. For what it's worth, I most definitely learned my lesson; the error of my ways, and all that. \n\n  James was never a fan of Valentine's, for reasons that are not mine to share, but I still checked in with him to make sure it was available, just in case. As expected, he had nothing planned for the day, so I went ahead and set it up. Rainey, the stunning girl in question, and I texted back and forth over that week leading up to our official meeting, and my anticipation was building with every message. \n\n  We discussed everything from taste in movies and music, to where we went to school, and even preferred sexual positions (hey, she brought it up…no innuendo intended). Over those days of messaging back and forth, I didn't pick up even the slightest of red flags that some crazy could be lingering behind her bright eyes. \n\n  Okay, so, after what happened, I went back through the thread to find there were a few, but as I said, I wasn't exactly guided by the top floor at the time. Still, I should've picked up on it when she asked about my ex-girlfriends and the like.\n\n  \"Those bitches just didn't appreciate you,\" one message read. \"You just had to wait for the right girl,\" and such. \n\n  They seemed innocent enough at the time, but I would normally feel a bit uneasy when these things came up before we even met. \n\n  Regardless of my excitement, I still arranged to meet at the restaurant. She came off a little offended when I recommended this over picking her up, but I wouldn't budge on this one. I've endured a few awkward rides over the years as I returned a crazy eyes or two to their home, so this was a far better option than facing the temptation of leaving someone stranded. \n\n  It may seem like a childish way to think, but even in the face of a nut job, I hate to leave someone without a way to get back home. Okay, I have had to leave a girl money for a taxi before, but that couldn't be avoided. It was that, or worry she would jerk the wheel halfway back to her place.\n\n  Rainey was already at the restaurant when I arrived; something that caught me a little off guard at first, as I pulled up a good fifteen minutes early, to grab us a table before she got there. As soon as I walked in, prepared to ask the hostess to jot my name down, I heard that very information yelled out from somewhere in the dining area. \n\n  When I noticed the head of my date, peeking out from a booth near the back, I felt stunned for a moment, giving an awkward smile and a wave, while just about every other face in the crowd turned to look at me. I attempted to ignore the chuckles and mumbles from the tables I weaved around, keeping my head hunched while my face flushed. \n\n  While I can't deny I was somewhat flattered by how Rainey was carrying on; enthusiastically waving and grinning as I made my uncomfortable approach, I was growing a little unsettled about what the night may have in store. \n\n  She looked absolutely stunning in that red, slinky dress, her raven hair hanging to her bare shoulders. \n\n  \"Hi, I'm…\" \n\n  My attempt to apologize for being 'late' was interrupted by my dining companion throwing her arms around me, damn near squeezing the breath from my lungs in the process. \n\n  Though we had been texting back and forth a good bit, I wasn't prepared for such an enthusiastic greeting. Given the fact that she was even more stunning in person than in the pictures I had seen, my logical mind took a back seat to that far more task-oriented, lesser brain that many of us possess; that one that habitually gets us into a lot of trouble, from time to time. I know; I'm not exactly proud of it, but, what can I say? \n\n  \"It's so nice to finally meet in person!\" she said, finally releasing her surprisingly strong, bear hug. \n\n  \"Um, yeah,\" I said with an awkward laugh, \"you look beautiful!\" \n\n  \"Well, that's an odd thing to begin with,\" she said, the wide smile fading from her face as she took her seat, \"I'm more than a pretty face, you know?\" \n\n  \"Oh, I didn't mean to insinuate…I just…\"\n\n  \"Oh my God!\" she said, laughing almost maniacally, \"you're such an easy mark! I was just messing with you, dude.\"\n\n  \"Ah…you got me,\" I said, suddenly feeling tense and a bit exhausted, \"good one.\" \n\n  Every word she spoke felt like an announcement, as though she were calling out to everyone in the room. It almost seemed like a performance designed to make everyone in the room uncomfortable, myself included. \n\n  I've never been a fan of being in the spotlight, even on that occasion James and I had to resort to step two. Of course, part of the point of that particular act of desperation was to make things as awkward as humanly possible. Plus, I was always a little braver in the presence of my best friend; a good bit more arrogant too, for that matter. \n\n  As soon as I took my seat, I tried to subtly sneak my phone from my pocket, preparing to send James the abort code as soon as the opportunity presented itself. With Rainey glaring wide-eyed, and unblinking, looking like she may burst out in a mad fit of laughter any second, I thought it best to keep my actions limited for the time being. \n\n  Needless to say (but I will anyway), I was well aware that I was in the presence of a 'crazy eyes'; perhaps the most aggressive case I had personally witnessed. \n\n  As things progressed; my date kept her gaze fixed on me, and even when the waiter arrived to take our drink order, I was growing almost desperate to escape. When I asked for a glass of water, making a lame excuse that I had to be at work early in the morning, Rainey practically barked at the waiter, demanding that he bring me a Jack and coke instead. \n\n  While that may have been partially my own fault, as I had mentioned this to be my favorite drink over the previous days of texting, I still tried to give the waiter; who looked almost dumbfounded, an apologetic shrug. With the expression he returned, I had a feeling he knew where my head was at the time. \n\n  \"Water?\" she said, looking almost disappointed, \"really?\" \n\n  \"I just don't wanna be hung over for work. You know…\"\n\n  \"Just call in sick, or something. You're gonna have a late night tonight, if you play your cards right, of course.\" \n\n  I almost jumped out of my seat when I felt her toes caressing my inner thigh, her lips peeling back into a mischievous smile. The waiter; who was still standing there, looking as uncomfortable as I felt, finally backed away from the table. \n\n  \"I'll be right back with those drinks,\" he said, shaking his head. \n\n  I just glanced at him, wearing my best 'help me' expression, before turning back to the wide-eyed woman whose foot was slowly creeping further up my leg. \n  \n  \"I have to go to the restroom,\" I said, jumping from my seat before my date's actions could leave me in no fit state to stand up in a public place. \n\n  I caught a brief glimpse of her agitated expression before I sped off in search of the facilities, but as soon as I was clear, I sent the hail Mary text to James. Once I made it to my chosen panic room, I took a seat in the farthest stall, eagerly awaiting a reply. \n\n  Though I knew my friend would wait a good ten minutes before calling with the prearranged, panic-inducing tale, I couldn't bring myself to head back to the table just yet. I even sent a few follow-up messages, just to state the urgency of the situation. \n\n  After a few minutes, and no word back from my partner in crime, I was growing more anxious about potentially being stuck there. Sure, I could've just made something up and run off, if it came down to it, but given Rainey's behavior up to this point, I was certain she wouldn't make that easy. \n\n  I even considered sneaking out while she wasn't looking, as childish as that may seem, but something about this woman assured me that there would be some retaliation for that. No, my only safe bet; the only 'clean' way to break free of this, was the abort code. \n\n  James had never let me down before. I had to believe he would come through this time. \n\n  Finally, with the ten-minute mark nearing, I reluctantly made my way back to the table. I could practically see the steam billowing from Rainey's nostrils as I drew closer, causing me to feel that tension returning to my extremities. \n\n  \"I'm so sorry about that,\" I said, sitting back down, avoiding eye contact. \n\n  \"Did I get you so excited that you had to go rub one out?\" she said, wearing the expression of a disappointed mother, more than an overly eager date. \n \n  \"What? No! I…\"\n\n  \"There's no shame in it,\" she said, sipping from her daiquiri, \"everyone does it.\"\n\n  \"But, I didn't…I had to…\"\n\n  \"Whatever, dude. You just better have enough left in the tank tonight.\" \n\n  I felt almost stunned in the headlights of her rigid gaze, as she laid her glass back down. \n\n  \"I ordered our food. You were gone so long, I didn't wanna have to wait any longer.\" \n\n  \"Oh,\" I said, choosing not to ask what God-awful dish she had spitefully requested for me, \"thanks. I really am sorry. Can't avoid the call of nature.\" \n\n  I attempted to chuckle; something that was not remotely genuine at the time, but she continued to stare knives at me. \n \n  \"Well, now I must answer a similar call,\" she said, sliding from her seat, \"don't run off while I'm gone. It would be quite rude.\" \n\n  She spoke so coldly before gingerly strolling off to the restroom, I found myself stunned once more. Had my mind not been all over the place, I may have been better prepared for what came next. My being frozen in place, staring blankly at the back of the restaurant until she started on her return trip from the restroom, I only had seconds to send another text to James, hoping to God he would hold up to our failsafe. \n\n  'HOW'S YOUR MOM AND THEM!?!?' I swiftly texted, hoping the screaming capital letters would alert him to how seriously I needed his assistance. \n\n  I quickly tucked my phone back into my pocket as soon as I hit send, right as my crazy-eyed date slipped back onto her seat across from me. Giving her what I hoped to be an effective enough 'I wasn't doing anything' smile, I was momentarily distracted by the vibrating noise coming from her purse. \n\n  As she pulled her bag onto her lap, dipping her hand inside and removing contents hidden to me by the table, she glanced up to meet my gaze with far more fury behind her eyes than before. She looked back down to her purse intently, the sound of her fingers tapping across the screen of what I assumed to be her own phone, before setting the bag back on the table. \n\n  \"I don't know about you, but I could use another drink,\" she said, a gentle smile returning to her face. \n\n  \"Yeah,\" I said, \"me too.\" \n\n  As a more friendly conversation began; one that provided me with far less discomfort than anything this night had presented me with so far, I hoped that the tension had finally eased completely. When my best friend's notification tone jingled from my pocket, however; I would find that my circumstances may be far bleaker than I realized. \n\n  Given that my date no longer looked as batshit as she had only moments before, I hoped it would be safe to at least glance at the message I had received. \n\n  \"I'm sorry,\" I said with a more genuine laugh as I swiped the screen. \n\n  'THEY ARE FINE!!! HOW ARE YOURS!?!?' the reply from James read. \n\n  Puzzled and a little dumbstruck by this, I sent back a questioning 'wtf, man?' before looking back to the woman on the other side of the table. \n\n  The strangely satisfied and slightly arrogant smirk she wore didn't fully register with me at first. When that vibrating sound buzzed from her lap, though, I finally began to put things together. \n\n  Again, she looked down as her fingers tapped across a screen, looking back up a second or two later. \n\n  When she lifted the phone from her lap, dropping it back in her purse, and laying it down beside her on the bench, 'Just focus on the gorgeous woman across from you, man. We'll talk tomorrow,' appeared in response to the text I sent. \n\n  A flood of questions attacked my mind all at once: how did she get his phone? What did she do to get it? Where the hell is James!? They were crowding my thoughts so quickly, my mouth couldn't hope to catch up. Just as I began to convince my voice to work again, our friendly waiter arrived, welding a tray of delicious-smelling food. \n\n  \"What the hell is going on here?\" I asked, the waiter cutting his eyes from me to Rainey as he hesitantly laid down the plates. \n\n  \"It's our food, honey,\" she replied with a giggle, \"that's kinda what happens in restaurants.\" \n\n  \"Um, would you guys like anything else?\" the uncomfortable-looking server said, still glancing between the two of us. \n\n  \"You know what I mean!\" I said. \n\n  \"That'll be all,\" my psychotic date said, smiling at the man who began to back away the second she granted permission to do so. \n\n  \"How…the hell…did you get…that phone?\" I asked, losing my patience with this ordeal. \n\n  \"I…don't know…what you're talking about,\" she said, mockingly, \"can we just eat already? I'm starv…\"\n\n  \"Don't change the subject! How did you get it? Did you steal it? Did you hurt him? What the fuck is going on, you fucking psycho!?\" \n\n  \"Dude!\" she said, reaching into her bag, and pulling out her phone, \"this is mine, okay?\" she slid it across the table, \"I don't know this James guy.\" \n\n  I whipped the device from the table, swiping the screen to inspect the messages. As expected, there was nothing sent or received for the last few hours.\"\n\n  \"Then who were you texting, huh? Who was texting you?\" \n\n  \"Um, okay, A: this is our first date and my personal life is none of your damn business; not unless I decide otherwise. B: I wasn't messaging anyone, I was shutting off my Facebook notifications.\"\n\n  \"Bullshit.\" \n\n  \"Look,\" she said with a heavy sigh, \"I'm hungry. Can we just eat? Whatever is going on with you; we can figure that out later, but I haven't eaten today, and I'm getting a headache.\" \n\n  While the burger she had ordered for me did look and smell intoxicating, I wasn't buying what she was selling for a moment. I knew she had my friend's phone, likely still tucked away in her bag, but as I felt that familiar sensation of having every eye in the crowd glaring at me, I knew I had to settle things down. \n\n  Whatever was going on here, I would have to play along to get to the bottom of it. I had to get her to let her guard down. \n\n  I let out a shaky sigh, reaching for my burger and taking a bite, while my mind attempted to figure out the best course of action. \n\n  \"I'm sorry,\" I said, \"it was a long day at work, and I didn't mean to take that out on you.\"\n\n   Her face reverted to that carefree smile as she reached for her matching dish. \n\n  \"No, I'm sorry,\" she said, \"I'm just nervous…I…I've never felt this way about anyone before.\" \n\n  \"Oh…um, yeah…me too,\" I lied, attempting to keep things civil until I could figure out a way to get to her purse. \n\n  \"Do you believe in love at first sight?\" \n\n  Those wide and unblinking eyes glared into mine again, a smile stretching across her lips. There was something behind her gaze and her words that caused a cold sweat to form on my back and brow. \n \n  When the waiter brought another round of drinks, not so much as uttering a single word as he laid the glasses in place, my date still just stared at me with that eerie grin. A strange sort of panic manifested within me, begging me to run now before it was too late. \n\n  I came close to doing that very thing. That was before the sudden onset of dizziness. \n\n  \"Oh my God, are you okay?\" Rainey asked as my head lifelessly drooped from one side to the other, my eyes attempting to roll back. \n\n  \"I…I feel weird…loopy…I…\"\n\n  My heart was practically beating through my chest as the realization of what was happening struck me, but my body and mind were on separate playing fields at the time. \n\n  \"Ricky,\" my date said to the waiter whose name I hadn't caught until now, \"gonna need some help here!\" \n\n  \"Took you long enough,\" he said, \"you sure about this guy?\" \n\n  \"Oh yeah,\" she said; I could almost hear the smile in her voice, as my head fell limp to the table, \"I just know he's the one!\"\n\n  \"What…what did…\" was all I managed to get out before everything went dark.",

        "text": "  \n\nI am a night shift security guard for a series of parking garages in the entertainment district in my city. Security is necessary here because people will leave cars after hours, drunkenly trash the bays and homeless people will seek shelter here which is an insurance liability. I take no joy in turning away people looking for shelter, but I take very little joy in any aspect of my job, save the solidarity. I put in my headphones at the beginning of my shift at 9PM, I set up podcasts to listen to until my shift ends at 5 in the morning. From 2 to 2:30 I get drunks out of the garage and on their way home, but other than that I very rarely have to talk to anyone. Nobody wants to talk to a security guard, and this particular security guard doesn’t care to talk to them either. Of course I get bored, but I need the money and I don’t ever think to myself “I wish I had someone to talk to.” I always just think “I wish I was at home watching movies or playing video games.” That’s part of what made the night I met Lauren so strange.\n\nI will start by saying that despite my natural disposition of being a lone wolf, I am still a straight human man with a pulse so I enjoy the attention of a beautiful girl. The second Lauren walked into the garage, sat down on the curb and lit up a cigarette she had all of my attention. First of all, she didn’t acknowledge me, like at all. Most people walk into an empty space and see a security guard they at least say something, she did not. She was gorgeous even under the florescent lighting, which very few people are, and she moved with so much confidence. She was wearing grey jeans with rips and tears all the way down her legs. She had a blank black t-shirt on and an old pair of Vans on her feet. She had a pixie cut that was died green and a ring through her nose. I caught myself staring and so did she.\n\n“Can I help you with something.” Her voice echoed across the garage where I was standing. It filled all of the space in the garage, almost like we were in a school gym, I just figured she was loud on purpose. \n\n“Well this is private property, ma’am. No parking after 2 AM and it’s almost 3:30 so anybody in here is considered to be trespassing.” God, I sounded like such a dweeb. I hated myself when it came out of my mouth. Maybe she could tell. \n\n“My goodness! Trespassing because I’ve sat down to have a cigarette? Call the cops I’ll be gone before they get here.”\n\n“I won’t call them as long as you promise not to stay too long. My bosses check the cameras.”\n\n“Your boss won’t even notice I’m here I’ll be gone so fast. Just tired of walking is all, needed to rest my feet. Not a lot of safe places for a girl to stop at 3 in the morning around here.”\n\n“That’s ok. What are you doing out here anyway?”\n\n“Couldn’t tell you, darling. Feels like I’ve been walking forever and I just need to sit. You’re kind to let me have a moment to rest.”\n\n“I’d let you rest longer but I kinda need this job and they’ve gotten on me about being too soft on people looking for shelter before.”\n\n“Imagine that. Someone just trying to get out of the cold or the rain or away from the thieves and other animals. A whole concrete building, safe and dry just sitting empty while people suffer on the street. How much do they pay you to watch people suffer.”\n\n“Umm… I”\n\n“Don’t answer that, I’m just giving you a hard time. I really am grateful for the rest, even if it was momentary. I should be on my way, my cigarette is out.”\n\nI looked down to step away from my station and by the time I looked up she was almost out of the door. I didn’t say anything, just let her leave. There wasn’t anything to say anyway, I couldn’t offer her more time to rest or a safe place. I just sat back down and went back to watching the security cameras.\n\nBefore my shift ended I went back to look at the footage my boss would inevitably see so I could measure how long she was there. Couldn’t have been more than 4 or 5 minutes, I couldn’t possibly get in trouble for that but I wanted to check anyway. I started rolling the footage between 3 and 4 in the morning and no matter which camera I was checking I couldn’t see her in any of the video. Not every single spot in the garage is covered of course, this isn’t Ft. Knox, but I didn’t think she was sitting in a blind spot. The camera from the security station was looking over my shoulder at where she should have been but there wasn’t anyone there. Furthermore, the cameras don’t record audio so I couldn’t hear our conversation even if I wanted to. \n\nThe tapes bothered me all the way home and then for days after. I then spent weeks hoping she’d come back for a sit, I wanted her to have a safe place to smoke a cigarette and rest her feet but she never came back. It was almost 4 months later, I came across the article. The article on the internet version of our local paper said that it was the one year anniversary of the police discovering the body of Lauren Keller. There was Lauren’s face. A picture clearly taken from some social media post. She was smiling in front of a waterfall, green pixie haircut. My heart sank into my stomach. I started to read. \n\n*“The body of a local woman was found in the Parker entertainment district downtown today, 6 days after she went missing. Local authorities have confirmed the body is Lauren Keller, who went missing in the early hours of September 22nd. She was walking to her nearby apartment after a night out with friends when she sent a text to her sister that she thought someone was following her. She eventually called her sister and said she would take shelter and wait for someone to pick her up but there was some arguing heard in the background before the signal cut off. When Lauren’s sister tried to call back there was no answer.* \n\n*“Security cameras show Lauren’s last location as a parking garage on West and Main, where a security guard is seen blocking her entrance from the garage. Lauren walks away and then 30 seconds later a hooded figure is shown walking down the sidewalk in the same direction as Lauren. No suspect has been identified.”*\n\nI hope she finds a place to rest. I know I won’t for a very long time.",

        "text": "The adrenaline was strong. Not fear though. Not yet. I was intrigued. The options were laid out in a simple list.\n\n\nVideo of every dream you have ever had (from Age 3 onwards) - $100.00\n\n\nVideo of every memory you have (Including forgotten and damaged memories) - $1000.00\n\n\nVideo of every daydream/fantasy you have ever had (from Age 2 onwards) - $10,000.00\n\n\nAudio of every thought you have ever had - $20,000.00\n\n\nA transcript of every word and sentence you have ever spoken - $30,000.00\n\n\nI had enough money for the video recording of my dreams, so I bought it and eagerly waited for the team to show up. The team is part of a company named Disinter.\n\n\nI discovered them after a bored search about the science of dreaming, which led me down a rabbit hole of people discussing dreams they had that happened to have occurred in real life afterwards. Far down that rabbit hole was a user on a forum who mentioned Disinter, an obscure company that was supposedly able to record just about anything from a conscious brain. It didn't ask for any bank information, and they had multiple video files of proof that could only be produced by high tech government technology.\n\n\nWhen the team showed up, we greeted each other. They were friendly, enthusiastic, and chill to be around. I won't go into detail though as that's not what's important. They put a white MRI-like machine on my head, and after a few minutes of sitting absolutely still, the machine was lifted and the team promised they'd send me mp4 files with my recorded dreams in them. A rush of intrigue washed over me. But there was also a pinch of unease. Dreams can be absolutely random and the contents seem normal to us only when we're in the dream, so would I be watching a ton of uncanny looking creepy stuff in real life? I decided that couldn't be the case half the time at the very least and waited patiently for the email.\n\n\nA few days later, it arrived.\n\n\n\"Your Dreams Are Here\"\n\n\nA rush of excitement ran through me and I opened the email right then. There were 288 attachments. Each one was labeled with a different time period. The first one was labeled \"September 13, 2005 - September 23, 2005,\" which, as promised, was exactly three years after I was born. I scrolled down to the bottom. Surely enough, the last attachment was titled \"December 28, 2022 - January 4, 2023\"\n\n\nI clicked the first attachment. The first dream was of everything being blurred out, as if being censored. Child me looked around, and I watched as I was pretty much seeing my childhood home again, and from my own perspective, although it was all blurry. Still interesting nonetheless.\n\n\nNothing to be concerned about though, as most of the dreams that followed took place in my childhood home. Things like old toys were interesting to see again. Other toys I couldn't recognize, so I wasn't sure if I made them up or not. And some toys were distorted shapes of random different colors and blurry formless variations of the same thing.\n\n\nIn the one named \"October 7, 2006 - October 17, 2006,\" the seventh dream began in the dark. What's happening here? A night light came into view. Oh, this is me in my bedroom at night, I'm guessing. The sound of the living room clock ticking. For some reason it was nostalgic. But then there was a… sound. It sounded like a fwump, but muffled.\n\n\nThis was one of my childhood nightmares.\n\n\nThe POV looked at the night light. A hand covered it and brightened it, revealing a silhouette of an arm. Child me followed the arm and noticed a silhouette of a man. It was still. Child me stared at it. I knew what he was feeling. I remember this very dream. I was frozen, adrenaline rising, I wanted him to leave. I couldn't leave as my reaction was to freeze. Watching this dream, remembering having it myself, I knew what was coming next. The silhouette's mouth opened, revealing a simplistic bright red covering the lower half of its face. It wasn't so creepy watching it in the present day, but when I was a kid, it sent me shivering. Watching it back was like a form of closure. I wasn't afraid of it anymore, so I felt safe. And besides, it was essentially just a rip off of Treatsforbeasts… It didn't matter anymore.\n\n\nThat's not to say I didn't have any nightmares that stick with me to this day. Around the 2 hour mark in the recording titled April 13, 2007 - April 23, 2007, the scenery changed to that of an office filled with thick dark smoke. Computers and papers were strewn all over the floor. The smoke hung over me. This was a recurring nightmare of mine. This one still sends chills up my spine. I was cold watching it play out. Child me looked around until he found a door. They sprinted up to the door and turned the knob, but it didn't move.\n\n\nWatching the dream in the present, I knew what was going to happen next. My breathing had become shallow. Child me looked behind him. A group of tall windows made up the wall across the room. As child me stared at the windows, a series of screams came from the hallway. They became distorted, sending chills down my spine as I watched on. These were creepy screams I hadn't heard in over a decade. I almost skipped through the video to avoid hearing them for any longer, but I needed closure.\n\n\nMy child self looked around at all the debris on the ground. Some of the computers were misshapen. Some looked glitched out. Some were more rectangular. Others were missing their back half. It was also odd how clear what I was watching was. It was in the highest quality I've ever watched anything in. The smoke began to surround child me, even obscuring the floor. As far as I remembered, he had no idea where to go. He stumbled around, waving his hands around as if it would help with the smoke. As he walked around, he eventually fell through the smoke.\n\n\nFalling from a great height terrified me when I was a kid. Let alone being in a burning room or entire building. I would freeze thinking about it. Watching this dream, my stomach tightened. I turned my head away but continued to watch the video with my peripheral vision. It was a dream, but ideas are still impactful. Also, there should be more careful approaches to bringing up certain events to kids.\n\n\nYou probably think I woke up during the fall, but unfortunately I didn't. The ground got closer. My stomach tightened more as I watched the ground get closer. Child me hit the ground. Face against the pavement. Faint sirens and sad saxophone lounge music blared from all directions. From what I remember, I couldn't move. Child me audibly hyperventilated and began to cry. I'm just glad I didn't yet know the true effects of falling from great heights. Instant death, liquification, a huge mess on the ground.\n\n\nI found I had the dream again in July 2007 with little difference. Once more in October 2007 with the only difference being that I was able to turn my head and see black buildings, firefighters, and paper. Then I had multiple flashes of the dream throughout 2008. I couldn't recall these flashes myself, but they were clear as day in the recordings. They always took place in that office. Everything was arranged differently each time, aside from one computer always having a cracked screen with the exact same color distorted picture.\n\n\nThe only time I remembered having the dream in 2008 was in September of that year. Even then, it was practically the same. Terrifying to me then, still terrifying to me now. Especially when watching it back. All the distorted and misshapen objects, less clutter than what would make sense, and eerie moments of silence sent more chills down my spine.\n\n\nMost of the dreams were random scenes with blurred or distorted objects in random scenes. I'd be in my kitchen, looking through the windows and seeing a purple sky, copies of one house sitting beside each other, no fence, absolutely no sound whatsoever. Then I'd be in a room that looked to be like a mashup of my childhood bedroom and my current bedroom, complete with a bathroom sink with no faucet. Then I'd be in my 12th grade Math class. The teacher is an unrecognizable man wearing white clothes decorated with random grey splotches. Most of my classmates have elongated faces with irregular shaped mouths, no lips, and no noses. Some of them are classmates I had in that class in real life. At least they looked normal. There were also one or two classmates who looked normal as well, but I couldn't recognize them at all.\n\n\nI'd look at a piece of paper on my desk. Random symbols were all that was on it. I'd look up at the ceiling then back down at the paper. The top of the page then had the school district logo, name of the school, and my name printed on it. The rest of the page then had random words for sentences all over it. I'd try to read it, but the page would be lifted off of my desk. I'd look up and see a boy my age with an oval shaped head and black curly hair holding the page, then tearing it up a few times and laughing.\n\n\nOkay then.\n\n\nThat's really how it was with the dreams. There was no actual plot. Just random settings with random objects and a lot of misshapen, cloned, and distorted stuff… Be it objects, animals, or people. I didn't even remember most of the dreams. We usually only dream during periods of rapid eye movement. REM. But I only remember 10% of the actual dreams. Of course, that's what I estimated after I had finished watching all of them.\n\n\nAnother thing I noticed was that all my nightmares had a much more coherent storyline than my other dreams.\n\n\nOne nightmare I watched back was from 2007. I was sitting on my bed, looking towards my door when I dark human figure with charred coloured skin and a messed up face popped up. It had a squiggly mouth running from the top of his head down to his chin. A pit formed in my stomach as I watched. This dream was still unsettling and downright terrifying. I thought I had gotten over it by the age of 10.\n\n\nChild me looked to his left, only for another human figure to peer up from the side of his bed. It had dark red and somewhat purple skin, eyes without eyelids, and a v-shaped mouth with thin black lips. The pit in my stomach tightened as I continued to watch. It was very detailed. I wanted to skip through it. Child me looked down at his blanket. I skipped through the recording until I got to the next dream, which was of me eating pizza while a Rihanna song weirdly set to the tune of an Aphex Twin song played behind me.\n\n\nThere was an odd period of time from around March 2009 through September 2013 in which… well… I'll just explain it head on.\n\n\nIn one dream, I watched a video on YouTube of security camera footage showing a tall man in a suit following a shorter man around and standing still in his front yard for an hour. Watching the dream, I recognized the video. I had watched it back in 2014 and it gave me a load of chills then. Watching it again was just as chilling. Another thing I noticed was the YouTube logo in the dream was the post-2013 logo and in the dream, child me peered at the upload date. March 17, 2011.\n\n\nOne thing confused me. The dream was part of the May 14 - May 24, 2009 file. Somehow, I watched the security camera video in my dream years before I watched it in the real world. And I'm not misremembering anything either. Right after I watched the dream, I looked for the video on YouTube. When I found it, I compared it to the one in the dream recording. Same locations, same angles, same camera timestamps (2011,) same upload date, the same tall man was there, the same shorter victim was there… everything.\n\n\nMaybe it was a mistake. There's no way I could see something in a dream before it existed in real life. Besides, in the dream, I was watching it on the computer in my childhood home, the home I lived in around 2009. In real life, I watched the video on a phone in an apartment.\n\n\nBut then I watched a dream from a July 2009 file. A news report played on the TV showing a tsunami carpeting a field with a landfill of wood, trees, cars, and broken up houses. \"From the Pacific,\" the bottom headline read. This seemed quite vague, but I knew it was familiar. I pulled up videos of  the 2011 Japan Tsunami. I didn't expect to find it, but there it was. The exact video from the dream with the same details. Same field layout, same pieces of debris in the same spots. It gave me chills.\n\n\nIn an October 2009 file, I sat in the passenger seat of a car going down an iced up road. Child me spoke. \"I can't believe I'm in Russia.\" The driver's hand pointed towards a tail of light in the sky. The light dissipated, then an ear puncturing loud bang erupted from the light's direction. Then I was reading a news article about a meteor exploding in the sky over Russia, with the publishing date just being Early 2013. I felt as much as a small rush of adrenaline. How was I seeing this?\n\n\nIn a March 2010 file, I was sitting on a roof in London, England, watching an apartment building burn. A news helicopter circled it, and the Big Ben clock stopped ticking. Chills ran down my spine watching the dream, as it reminded me of the fire in 2017.\n\n\nIn an April 2011 file, I was walking down a hallway while wearing a medical mask and gloves. A voice spoke over the system. \"Please wait until further instructions are given.\" Child me walked into a room to the right. Three women sat in the room. One on a chair, one stood beside a TV, and one was laying on a bed. Each of them wore masks and gloves.\n\n\n\"What's going on?\" Child me asked.\n\n\n\"Virus,\" the woman in the chair said.\n\n\nThe woman on the bed uttered something but I couldn't make out what it was. It didn't sound like a foreign language or even anything that would come from a human. Or even an animal. She wasn't showing any signs of sickness. And the virus I suspected it was didn't have any such vocal symptom. It was a dream though, so there's that.\n\n\n\"Stay away,\" the woman beside the TV said.\n\n\nA man spoke over the PA system again.\n\n\n\"Today is March 12, 2020. Covid-19…\"\n\n\nAfter speaking the virus's name, his words trailed off into gibberish.\n\n\n\"2020? That's 9 years away! I'm in the future! Hopefully this virus doesn't kill everybody. Hopefully they make a cure,\" Child me said.\n\n\nI felt frozen in confusion and amazement. I couldn't recall this dream, or any of the predictive dreams I had watched so far.\n\n\nIn a November 2012 file, child me was walking throughout his home, in which everything had a shiny glow. He opened the door, revealing a hideous sight. The trees standing around the houses across the street were infested with little black creatures the size of leaves, every window on the four houses I could see were boarded up, a pale white human head was sticking out of a storm drain, and little holes were forming on the road. Out of each of them came 10 foot long centipedes that squirmed off in all directions.\n\n\nAn intense sinking feeling overcame me. I remembered the dream. It was a nightmare that plagued my mind for days afterwards and had given me a fear of holes for a month. The head still gave me a sinking feeling. The centipedes still gave me chills. One thing I remembered about the dream were symbols in the sky that looked like a code. Watching the sky in the recording, because I was too creeped out to look anywhere else, the code slowly popped up. It was familiar, but the type of code it was has escaped me.\n\n\nAs I stared on, a dark red circular object hovered by and stopped above the doorstep. Oh yeah, this guy. An eye popped out from the underside of it. It had a brown pupil that glanced towards child me and just stared. Another pit formed in my stomach. It's difficult to describe how uncanny and realistic this thing looked. How the eye was part of it and somehow bigger than it. Child me looked at the road. The ground began to shake. More centipedes crawled out of the holes, then the head in the drain sunk out of view. It looked as if it had been pulled down by someone or something. I didn't want to stick around to watch some realistic looking freaky stuff, so I skipped through the video, looking forward to a complete scenery change.\n\n\nI hope that dream wasn't a predictive one. Maybe it was some random stuff put together in anticipation of the supposed Mayan apocalypse, but it all stood out so weirdly. I never had a dream like that one before or since then. There was no indication of when the scene took place. The architecture of the homes reminded me of the homes around the northeastern US that were built in the 70s. It couldn't be far into the future. The adrenaline is rising. When and where did that dream take place? Maybe the creepy things in that scene were localized to that area only? I can't be sure, unfortunately. It's all speculation.\n\n\nThe final predictive dream was of large cartoon-like bombs with the Russian and old Soviet flags falling down on Ukraine during the winter. It's probably obvious what that was predicting.\n\n\nAfter getting to the end of a December 2014 file, I was exhausted. By that time, I had dedicated a few hours each day for three days to watch a bunch of the dreams from each file. I closed the file I had open and checked the time. 1:30 AM. I had no idea it was that time already. I shut my laptop off, then I went to bed. I promised myself I'd take a lot more time to process all of what I had been watching at some point in the future.\n\n\nThe next morning, I woke up with somebody's arm around me. It was rotten green and white and its smell… I covered my nose to block it out. I pushed the arm off me and looked to my left. A rotted face with dangling skin and missing eyes laid on the pillow beside mine. I froze.\n\n\nWhat the hell is this doing here? How did it get here? When did it get here?\n\n\nAfter a minute of cold feelings, I looked towards the door. As I turned my head, I swear I saw its head move.\n\n\nThat shit didn't just move, did it?\n\n\nI was about to jump off my bed and run, but a breathy throaty weak voice hit my left ear.\n\n\n\"Help us. We're contacting you using the most advanced measures possible for us. We first contacted you 10 years ago. Help us.\"\n\n\nChills ran down my spine. That hellish looking thing was alive. I could only associate something like this with wild hallucinations. However, I hadn't ever had a wild hallucination before. Maybe I was dreaming? I layed back down in my spot, resting my head on the pillow… and facing away from that horrible thing that was somehow alive despite its physical condition.\n\n\nTen minutes later, its presence vanished. I had woken up from whatever that dream was all about. I looked to my right and there was a crease in the bed. As if someone had been laying there. I didn't want to entertain the thought I may need to go to a doctor, so I got up and did my usual morning routine. Afterwards, I sat down at my desk and started up my laptop. Once my notifications flooded in, one caught me off guard.\n\n\n\"January 5, 2023 - January 15, 2023\"\n\n\nHow? It's not like my dreams could've been recorded after the time I was visited by the team. I clicked on the file and a video started. I was walking down my home street, watching cars roll by. I skipped through the video and saw some familiar sights. I watched the running dream I had in the middle of last week, I watched the white lines in the sky dream I had on Saturday. I realized these were the dreams I had over the 10 days after the 4th. But how? They were never recorded. But they were recorded anyway somehow.\n\n\nI skipped through the rest of the video and watched every dream I had that morning while thinking about sending a message to the company. After the video ended, I wrote up a message asking them how I got my most recent dreams despite not getting them recorded by the team after having them. While waiting for them to respond, my heart dropped.\n\n\nThe zombie dream wasn't in the recording.\n\n\nI went back and skipped to the end. I was standing on a beach, covering my nose with my hand. The picture faded to white, then the video ended. That was indeed what I was dreaming right before waking up to see the arm and smell the body's terrible odor. But where was it? The dream about the zombie wasn't there.\n\n\nI sent Disinter a second message asking about the missing zombie dream. An hour later, I got a response to both my question about the extra recording and the missing zombie dream.\n\n\n\"We thought you might appreciate it. Some of your dreams are very unique. Especially 11242012BrightHomeDarkReality04:23S, and so it's amazing we could have you as a client! We're sharing with you weekly recordings of all your dreams for the foreseeable future. Thank you!\"\n\n\n\"Every piece of content in our recording(s) is unedited, preserved, and the content is owned by you. Anything not included in our recording(s) was a real world event. If you believe you recall a dream that wasn't included in the recording(s) make sure you:\n\n\nHave watched the recording(s) all the way through.\n\n\nDouble check by watching the recording(s) all the way through a second time.\n\n\nConsider you may have misremembered a past event as a dream.\n\n\nConsider you may have imagined a dream you have misconstrued as a dream you had in actuality.\"\n\n\nWhen I had the time, like… two weeks later, I revisited the late November 2012 file and scanned through it until the title mentioned above popped up at the top of the screen. Child me was in a bright home. He opened the door revealing the twisted scene I already described. It was that dream. Why would they find it so interesting? Was it the code-like message floating in the sky? I waited for the message to pop up, then I transcribed it. This is what it reads:\n\n\n- .... . / -.-- ..--- -.- / -... ..- --. / -.-. .-. . . .--. . -.. / .. -. - --- / --- ..- .-. / .-. . .- .-.. .. - -.-- .-.-.- / .... . .-.. .--. / ..- ... .-.-.-\n\n\nI need to continue on with my usual business right now. After that, I'm going to give myself A LOT more time to process all the dream stuff. I don't want to watch certain dreams again. I may even avoid opening the files those dreams are in despite the dozens of lighter dreams that accompany them. I'm just going to think about what all of this might mean. Well, out of what I watched anyway. There are dozens of files I haven't opened yet, and I don't feel very eager to. What if I think a dream about me dying is foretelling something?\n\n\nThis was exciting at first, but now I'm overwhelmed with confusion, amazement, and the creeps. I can't recall watching the nightmares without being overwhelmed with chills. I can't recall the predictive dreams without wondering how the hell I got information beforehand, then becoming overwhelmed with the unknown and a ton of anxiety about the future.\n\n\nDon't get me started on where the hell that zombie came from and whether or not it's going to come back. A pit formed in my stomach just typing about it. I'm very creeped out.\n\n\nI just noticed something on my sock. It looks like rotted flesh. Damn it, I don't want to have to move away from here.

        "text": " Part one  [Return to the Silver head Mine Part 1 : nosleep (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10vmig2/return_to_the_silver_head_mine_part_1/) \n\nI looked behind me to see dozens of Wiowalks laying on the ground not moving. The 308 was hitting with much more kinetic force then my 40 caliber pistol. It was putting them down and keeping them down. An empty magazine hit me right in the face as Mairo continued the onslaught. A thought popped into my head from one of the firearms instructors, *Pistols put holes in people, rifles put holes through people.*\n\nAs another magazine hit my face, Mairo yelled, “I’m out.” He grabbed me by the collar of my shirt and with what seemed like no effort at all, he picked me up and said, “ Marine, we are leaving.”\n\nHe shoved me toward the cook shanty. I looked out over the area between me and the elevator. There were over three dozen Wiowalks laying on the ground with the back of their heads blown out. I was so shocked that I stopped running and just stood there, mouth agape. Mairo ran up, shoved me, and shouted, “Unless you are trying to catch a flying rooster in your mouth, close it and keep moving. We are not done with this fight.”\n\nI looked closer and saw at least thirty more crawling out of the mineshaft and coming towards us. In its mad dash to get to us, one of the Wiowalks crashed into a telephone pole, snapping it like a toothpick and knocking out the power to all buildings.\n\nI ran though the double doors gasping for air. Mairo looked like he wasn’t even breaking a sweat. He spun around and was trying to figure out how to lock the door. In a move of sheer genius, Mairo took his rifle and put it between the two pull handle loops on the door. He disconnected his rifle sling, wrapped it around the handle for good measure and tied it off. The door began to shake and groan as the Wiowalks tried to push their way into the building. The sound of cracking plastic could be heard as the polymer frame began to bend and flex. After a brief moment the sounds stopped.\n\nI whispered to Mairo, but in my current state it came out as a shout. “Do you have any more ammunition for that rifle?” Mairo looked at me, cupped his hands around my ear and said,\n\n“If I did, I would not be using it as the world's most expensive door lock.” I gave him a shrug that meant ‘Ok fair point.’ “We need to clear this building of hostiles,” Mairo said.” I gave him a thumbs up.\n\nUnder the glow of emergency lights that cast everything in erie long shadows, we walked over to the first door we saw. Mairo pointed at me and gave me the number one sign and pointed to go right. He then pointed at himself, made a number two sign and pointed to the left. I nodded my head in acknowledgment, unholstered my pistol and had it in the low ready. Mairo opened the door and stood to the side. I went in first and turned right with Mairo close on my heels as he swung left. We cleared the kitchen attached to the cook shanty. We did this for each door we came up to. Most of the rooms on the other side were small closets. One of the doors led outside, but luck was on our side as no creatures were around so we immediately retreated back into the cook shanty.\n\n“Last door.” Mairo said as he opened the door. I rushed in and hooked right, my weapon light activated. I saw a man sitting in a chair behind a desk. It looked like he was sleeping. I fell back on my training and without even thinking I yelled,\n\n“Sheriff’s department, show me your hands. Do it! Do it NOW!”\n\nMairo grabbed the guy out of the chair and put him on the ground. I holstered my pistol and went hands on, putting my knee next to his elbow and moved his right hand to the small of his back. I placed my other knee and leg across his back on the shoulder blade and grabbed his other hand. Holding both of his hands in one of mine, I reached on my belt for cuffs. A surge of panic washed over me when I could not find them. Then I remembered that I don’t carry them anymore. I looked up and saw Mairo smiling at me like a lion proud of his cub taking down his first gazelle.\n\n“Mario, restraints,” I demanded. The former Gunnery Sergeant handed me a roll of duct tape. With Mario’s help, we tied the man up.\n\n”Dang, you jumped on that guy like fly on crap,” Mairo said.\n\n“Is he dead?” Mairo asked.\n\n“No, he's drunk. Passed out. I've seen it before. Also, the trash can is full of empties, which was a dead give away. He's breathing and also has no wallet or ID. We just need to wake him up.”\n\nMairo cracked a grin and said, “Well Deputy, would you like to do the honors?” The grin was contagious, I could feel one of my own forming on my face. I put my hands up in mock surrender.\n\n“Oh no, no, no Gunny. The pleasure is all yours,” I said sarcastically.\n\nMairo let out a snort, “You know how many times I woke up to lance corporals doing this? Way, way too many.”\n\nWith the stranger sitting up in the chair, Mairo closed his fist and placed his knuckles firmly against the man’s sternum and vigorously started to rub. After a few seconds the man let out a groan and his eyes fluttered open. He looked around in panic. As soon as he realized his arms were tied up, he started to hyperventilate. The light from an LED lantern we found was the only thing lighting up the room.\n\nThe man yelled, “I got to close the mine!”  \nMairo grabbed his shoulders to hold him still and got right in the man’s face. In a calm upbeat voice bordering on the edge of sounding like a psycho killer Mario asked, “Hey buddy, care to tell us what kind of grab ass goat rodeo is going on here today?”\n\n“My my my name is Mark. I own this mine. Now let me go. I have to close the doors to the mine. You don’t understand the danger we are all in.”\n\n“Yeeeeeaaaahhhhh, about that…… little late for that,” I said in a long sarcastic tone.\n\n“What time is it? Who are you people? Let me go.”\n\nMairo looked at his watch and said, “It's 1813 hours, and we are with the armored truck to pick up your cash.” With a quick wrist flick I opened up my pocket knife and was about to cut Mark loose.\n\n“Hold up Alex. Before you cut him loose, he needs to tell us exactly what is going on here and what those things are.”\n\nMark's eyes got as big as dinner plates. “You mean they got out?! Oh no, that’s not good,” Mark said anxiously. “Ok, so let me explain. When a man named George Ravenwood owned this mine, he did some bad things to good people. The land was cursed by a local Native American tribe. Demons called Wiowalks attacked everyone, so the surrounding towns came together and built the iron doors to seal the mine shut, but the curse remained after all these years. They hunt based on sound and if they come out into the sun, they turn to dust.”\n\n“How many are there?” Mairo asked.\n\n“Ummmm, I don't know, probably sixty. They only come out at night so I lock up the mine before sundown and never get an actual count.” Mark replied.\n\n“Where are the other employees?” I asked.\n\nMark gave me a quizzical look. “Other employees? No, it's just me.”\n\n“No, there was a girl that was working in the ticket booth. She has blond hair and an athletic build,” I explained.\n\nMark looked at me, confused.\n\nI let out a sigh and mumbled, “Really nice rack.” Mairo perked up at that.\n\nMark looked at me in horror as the realization slowly sunk in. “Was there anyone else you saw?” Mark asked with a shakiness in his voice.\n\n“Yeah, one tall guy with a high and tight military haircut and one chick with the most emerald green eyes I’ve ever seen. I swear I’ve seen her before.”\n\n“Oh fudge me,” Mark exclaimed. “I hired some college students to give tours and something really bad happened.”\n\nWe cut Mark loose and he spent the better part of an hour explaining everything that happened and the horrific details.\n\n“You are a monster,” I proclaimed.\n\n“What, so they are ghosts? Ghosts are not real,” Mairo said.\n\n“You sent lead into the brain stems of demons but ghosts are where you draw the line?” I replied.\n\n“Yeah, it’s a matter of principle,” Mairo said.\n\n“That’s not…..but how….. you know what….. just whatever,” I said. “Wait just a second. If they hunt based on sound, why have they left us alone this time?”\n\n“I don’t know. There’s probably something louder outside,” Mark answered.\n\nMairo peeked out the window and said, “Well, there's your loud noise.”\n\nWe joined Mario at the window and saw about twenty of the Wiowalks swarming over our truck, trying to get at the loud diesel engine that was protected under armor plating.\n\nMark got closer to get a better look and said, “Perfect, we will just wait them out until morning. They will either go back into the mine or die in the sun. This calls for a drink. Mark walked over to the bookshelf and pulled a flask out from between two books and took a long pull. His hands were shaking the whole time. “You boys want to tie one over while we wait?”\n\nWhat time is sunrise?” I asked. Mark smacked his lips and tossed the flasked away. He was rooting around the cabinet under the bookshelf for more alcohol and came up with a bottle of Knob Creek.\n\n“It’s not until 7am or as you military people say Oh-Seven Hundred,” he said, giving a half assed salute. Mario turned from the window, pure anger radiating from him. I turned to respond,\n\n“Hey Mairo, it's cool, remember we don’t want to draw the attention of those things outside.” One of Mairo's eyes was twitching. He stomped up to Mark and said,\n\n“Oh……Oh…… Oh?! Oh is not a number, you mother jumper. Oh is the sound my wife made for three hours straight on our honeymoon. It’s zero…zero seven hundred.” Mairo continued on, his rage slowly subsiding. “And it doesn’t matter. The truck will run out of fuel in about three hours or so. We were going to fill up at that shitty little gas station at the edge…” I cut Mairo off.\n\n“Mark, is there a landline phone we can use to call for help if our cell phones don’t have service?”\n\nMark let out a hiccup and with a slight slur said, “Yeah, it’s in that cabin over there,” he said, pointing toward the window. Mairo started grinding his teeth like he was eating his own jaw.\n\n“You mean the cabin between us and the armored truck? The same armored truck swarming with those things around it?”\n\nMark had the bottle to his lips and gave a nod. In less time then it would take to describe it, Mairo lunged across the room and slammed Mark against the wall stunning him. Mairo even managed to grab the half drunk bottle of Knob Creek and hold onto it. In a deep growl Mairo threatened, “Listen here you rooster sucker, the bar of expectations is at the ground, yet here you are with an eff-ing shovel. I swear to heaven you must have two brain cells left and they are both battling it out for third place.”\n\nI was caught between helping Mark or just falling over laughing at Mario’s words. By the time I was ready to decide, Mairo was starting to wind down. “If you were one of my recruits, I would have you outside apologizing to the tree for its extra work to provide you with oxygen.”\n\n“Hey Gunny, you good man?” I asked, while trying to hold back my laughter.\n\n“Yeah, I’m good. Sometimes you gotta yell at stupidity extra loud,” replied Mairo.\n\n“That’s all well and good, but we need to find a way out of here. As soon as the truck runs out of fuel, our goose is cooked. Do you have your portable radio?”\n\n“No, I left it in the truck. What about yours?” Mario replied.\n\n“It’s at the bottom of a lake. It was attached to my vest.”\n\n“Hey, hey, hey. \\*Hiccup\\* I have an idea. Why don’t \\*hiccup\\* one of you like, ninja crawl over to the cabin and call for \\*hiccup\\* help.” Mark said in a drunken slur.\n\n“You know what Mark? I’m going to start calling you Baskin Robbins because you’re thirty-one flavors of messed up. You do know that, right?”\n\nI let out a snort and said, “It could be done if we were stealthy enough.”\n\n“Although the police will not \\*hiccup\\* come out this far last \\*hiccup\\* last time I called 911, the park ranger showed up. It is their jurisdiction.” Mark said.\n\n“No park rangers!” I blurted out.\n\nThe other two looked at me in confusion. I took a deep breath to calm myself.\n\n“No…no park rangers. Park rangers and I don’t get along very well. Mark sat down in the chair behind his desk and said,\n\n“Well, I know what I’m going to do. I’m going to sit back and relax with my favorite drink and listen….to you two figure out a solution to this problem.” Mairo grabbed the bottle of bourbon from Mark's hand. He took a pull and smacked his lips and then handed the bottle to me. I shrugged my shoulders, took the bottle and said,\n\n“When In Rome.” The harsh liquid burned my esophagus as it made its way down to my stomach. I started to cough. Between coughs I said, “Smooth.”\n\nMairo and Mark both let out a little laugh. “We need to assess what we have available to use. Look for what is going to help us implement and improve our odds of escaping,” Mario announced. “Everyone empty their pockets.”\n\nMairo and I started laying everything out on the desk. Amidst the pile there was a pocket knife, wallet, and keys. Suddenly, Mario started to grin. “Lookie lookie what I got here.” He held up a silver device about the size of a thumb drive.\n\n“You got the dead man switch alright Gunny.” I let out a “Hoo-Ah!”\n\nMario looked at me and sighed while he pinched the bridge of his nose. “Hoo-Ah is Army, Oo-Rah is the Marines and Ouch, I got a papercut for the Air Force.”\n\nMark butt in, “Hey, hey, I got \\*\\*hiccup\\*\\* questions. Not to sound stupid, but,” Mairo cut him off,\n\n“Too late for that Burgundy Cherry, but what’s your question?” Mark completely ignored the insults and continued on.\n\n“What is the dead man switch?”\n\nI spoke up, “Without getting too deep into all the security components of an armored truck, the dead man switch is a device that protects against hijacking. If the truck is driven too far away from the device, the truck will shut down, lock the doors and call the police. However, with no cell phone service, it will not call the police.”\n\n“With that in mind, I have an idea.” Mairo said\n\n**One hour later**\n\n“Let’s go over it one last time,” Mairo said. “I will take the dead man switch far enough away that it shuts the truck off. Alex, you and Green Mint Stick will make your way over to the elevator control shack and turn on the generator. Peppermint Fudge Ribbon here will ride it down and make a bunch of noise to draw Wiowalks away and down into the mine. Then Alex will stop the elevator half way down the shaft.”\n\nMark spoke up, “Then I just wait until morning and ride the elevator up and push all the Wiowalks up with it until they hit sunlight and BAM they are all dead. I still don’t see why I have to be the one in the elevator.”\n\nI replied with, “One it’s our truck, and two, it’s your mine so it’s your problem. Three, someone has to stay and switch the elevator back to manual operator because the down button doesn’t work. And finally, number four, we are the ones with the guns.”\n\n“Once Lemon Sherbet is in the elevator shaft, Alex will walk to the truck and I’ll circle back and we will ride off into the night,” Mario finished.\n\nWe made our way to the door. Mark grabbed a cast iron pan and a large soup ladle to make noise with. Mairo untied the rifle strap and pulled the rifle out from the door handle. It looked beat up, but was in working condition for the most part. Mairo silently made his way toward the woods, while Mark and I made our way to the mineshaft opening and the shack holding the generator and controls. We primed and got the generator ready. Mark handed me a set of walkie talkies. As I stepped outside, I could see the Wiowalks all over the truck. *It’s going to be hard to explain the new scratch marks and missing paint,* I thought to myself. The faint rumbling of the truck ended with a spudder and cough. The dark, still, silence was only broken by the occasional scratching sound of claws on metal accompanied by a hiss.\n\nI walked inside the small shack and closed the door. Mark fired up the generator and the elevator's control systems came to life. Mark handed me a set of big puffy headphones for hearing protection. My hearing was almost back to normal and I did not want to ruin it again.\n\n“Here are the controls.” Mark said in a shout. “This is the elevator manual override lever. Once engaged, the only way to control the elevator is in this building.” He pointed to a display screen with a long rectangle representing the elevator shaft and a square that represented the elevator itself. He put a piece of tape in the middle of the rectangle. “Stop the elevator here,” he said, pointing to the tape. “That’s the halfway point, make sure you throw this lever.” He pointed to the lever that said ‘Override.’ “That will give me control of the elevator again, otherwise I can’t use the control in the elevator itself. Alright let’s go.”\n\nMark stepped into the elevator, yelled, “Wait one second.” He ran behind the generator, knocking over a large set of bolt cutters. He returned with a three liter bottle of Jack Daniels. Mark walked past me, patting the bottle and said, “Can’t forget Uncle Jack.” I shook my head in utter disbelief, but remembered that addiction is a power thing. I started to slowly lower him down. I could hear the clanging of the soup ladle against the pan.\n\nMark came on over the radio, “Ok, drop me down. I got their attention.” The humming of the generator was quickly drowned out by the sound of running feet and hands thudding against the ground. I watched on the screen as the elevator quickly descended. I stopped at the halfway point. A few moments later the elevator dropped a little and the screeching sound of metal on metal could be heard. I ran over to see what it was just as the radio cracked to life. “Everything good up there?” Mark said over a wave of static. The sound was the brakes pressing against the brake disk. It was holding, but any major bump would cause the brakes to slip just a little.\n\nI replied with, “10-4 the brakes are struggling to hold the weight of the elevator and the Wiowalks. Just try to not move around so much.” I monitored the brakes for a few more minutes and radioed in. “Ok Mark, I’m going to switch it over to manual now.”\n\nI was just about to throw the lever into manual mode when the door suddenly flew into the room, and I mean flew. It snapped the hinges and the locking mechanism in one go. In front of me stood a Wiowalk breathing heavily and looking like it was here for revenge. It had a cut along its cheek where my bullet had grazed it before. Visible bruises and welts could be seen where it was tackled by its compatriots. I quickly pulled my pistol out. I defaulted to my training and activated my weapon light, setting it to strobe, trying to disorient the charging creature.\n\nI fired as the creature ran towards me with pure hatred. It was ignoring the sound coming from the mine shaft and apparently went out of its way to find me. I fired once and then a second time, not aiming for the head, but getting shots on center mass. The slide on my pistol locked back just as the Wiowalke slammed into me. My gun skidded out of view and before I could get to my feet I was picked up and thrown across the room. I landed by the big spool of elevator cable. The Wiowalk was seeing nothing but red, or I guess in this case, hearing nothing but red. It charged at me and got entangled in the myriad of hoses, cables, and other elevator parts. The Wiowalk tried to reach for me, and I was stuck in the corner unable to move. Fortunately I was just a few inches out of reach. I looked around for a weapon, and remembered that I had my pocket knife. I pulled out my Smith and Wesson border guard knife and tried my best to stab the hand. I got two stabs into the palm when the creature’s hand wrapped around the blade and pulled it from my grasp. I heard it clatter to the ground in front of me. Then, I saw the bolt cutters that were knocked over. They were just out of reach, but I had an idea.\n\nI yelled, “Hey asshole! Yeah, you with the face! Come get me!” This enraged the Wiowalk. I don’t know if it was just the noise from me talking or the words themselves that were spoken, but the Wiowalked doubled its effort to get me. As soon as both arms came through the rubber hydraulic hoses, I ducked down and lunged in an awesome move that I probably could not do again if my life depended on it, which in this case it did. I grabbed the bolt cutters, did a somersault and landed on my feet. I spun and dove towards the Wiowalk’s hands. The head of the bolt cutters landed inside the creature’s wrist. I pushed down on the levers, cutting off one of the oversized hands with a sickening crunch.The demon from hell hissed and bucked as black oily blood squirted from its missing hand. I wound up the bolt cutters like it was a baseball bat and I need a grand slam to win the World Series. I swung for all I was worth making contact with the Wiowalks jaw. As it separated it from his body, I could hear skin being torn. The creature fell on the ground. I raised the bolt cutters over my head and repeatedly brought it down onto its face over and over again. I stumbled my way over to the control and started to panic when the override lever was snapped. The brakes were starting to strain. I got on the radio,\n\n“Mark the control lever is broken in half. I can’t give you control.” With a rush of static I heard,\n\n“Pull me up, pull me up!”\n\nI replied, “I’m trying the elevator motor. I don't think it can take the weight.” I paused for a few seconds and heard a creaking sound. “Mark the brakes are failing dude. I’m so sorry.” The sound of fishing line being unspooled grew loud as the elevator picked up speed and free fell into the bottom of the shaft, with Mark still inside. In shock I looked around until I found my pistol. I reloaded it with my last magazine and found my pocket knife. I walked out of the elevator room using the bolt cutters as a makeshift crutch. I started to close one of the iron doors when Mairo came pulling up in the armored truck. He turned the truck off to lessen our noise as he said,\n\n“Hey, where is Cherry Macaron?”\n\nI looked up at him and my face said it all, “He didn’t make it.” We closed the heavy iron door, wrapped the chain around it and locked it. None too soon had we finished that banging could be heard coming from the heavy iron doors.",

        "text": "Okay, I’m not even sure where to start but my hands are shaking as I am writing this and I am terrified.\n\nAbout a year ago, I was lying in bed, trying to fall asleep, when I heard a tapping sound coming from my window. My bed is right next to the window so it was loud and a very clear tapping sound. At first, I tried to ignore it, making myself believe it was just a branch from the tree outside, but the tapping persisted. I sat up in bed and listened carefully, my heart racing.\n\nThe tapping became louder and more persistent, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that someone was outside, trying to get my attention. I slowly made my way to the window and peered out, but I couldn’t see anything in the darkness. I closed the curtains tightly and went back to bed, but the tapping continued.\n\nI still kept telling myself it was just the wind, but the sound was too rhythmic and deliberate.  There was someone, or something, outside. I reached for my phone to call the police, but before I could dial, the tapping suddenly stopped. \n\nI went back to bed, listening for any sound for hours, but all was silent. I eventually fell into a fitful sleep but was awoken several times throughout the night by the tapping. I was too afraid to look or even open my eyes at all…\n\nThat next morning, I went outside to check the window, and there was no sign of damage or anything out of the ordinary. The tapping did not return, but I knew that something sinister had been at my window that night…\n\nAs I said, this happened like a year ago, and last night I heard it again. The tapping at my window, just as loud and persistent as it was before. I was paralysed with fear, not knowing what to do. I actually mustered up the courage to get out of bed and go to the window. I cautiously pulled back the curtains with my heart pounding in my chest. \n\nThere it was, a figure standing outside my window, smiling at me eerily. The smile stretched unnaturally wide across its face and it just stood there, still tapping its finger on my window.\n\nI stumbled back from the window in terror, tripping over my own feet. I scrambled to my feet, heart racing, and ran to my bathroom. I stayed there the whole night. I was on the phone with my brother for a while who tried to call me down and obviously thought I was making shit up, but it made me feel safe. After about three hours the sun started to rise and I gathered the courage to open my bathroom door. I was facing the window with the curtains still opened, no sign of the figure. \n\nI am left with no explanation for what I saw. What was this and what does it want? No one believes me and I am terrified. It’s getting dark again now and I don’t know if the figure will be out there tonight, waiting for me, or if he will reappear a year from now again… I will keep you updated.",

I could see the figures of people that never  passed on the other side left wandering around the world in an attemp to ease themselves. you cant see their faces but only their shadows..  This 'thing'  tho has a set of rules going on for the figures you encounter..\n\nNumber1. You never look straight at them for a long time .\n\nNumber 2. You don't invite them in NEVER.\n\nNumber 3 . They can't harm you .. only scare you (unless you invite them in your home thus the number 2)\n\nNumber 4. If it goes too far pray and everything will be fine.\n\nFrom times to times I would often see spirits in my dreams trying to come in my place in the form of my late grandpa or friendly figures even in the form of cats and dogs and other things .. the good part is that you could always sense that they are evil .. I don't know how it works really u just get it .. u sense the evilness in their eyes ,fun fact I am actually a lucid dreamer since childhood and could always control and alter my dreams.Although it didn't stuck to dreams only..\n\nI remember one night I was casually playing in my computer (assemble gamers of reddit) and I heard footsteps and screaming from outside .. current time was 3 03 at night and I went on my balcony.. I saw in the wall figures of people running with wagons ,crying,screaming in a language I didn't know and never heard of ,little kids falling and being pressed to death by the feet of others and torches in the air . \nIt was so loud I checked the other apartments but no one was out ..The road was empty and u couldn't see anything In miles except from me that could still see the figures in the wall  .. it was the first time that I froze and felt that I couldn't move ,tears where streaming down my face and I could barely breath by the smell of the torches in the air .. \n\nI closed my eyes and prayed thus falling into the ground and hitting my ankle . Everything went silent and I went back inside but  as soon as I closed the window the smell of the torch flattered my apartment and I could see visible smoke in the air.. I opened the window again and quietly went and covered myself in my blanket crying all night and praying..\n\n\nMy grandma came down the next morning woke me up and informed me that it was my time to deliver the koliva and bread (spiritual food we cook for the dead in Greece.) cause it was an all souls day and my uncles where waiting for me to deliver..\n\nOf course no one believed me and laughed that I dreamed it but I know the truth and it's far from that maybe my\" thing'' got triggered due to the day ..\n\nI don't know who they where or why they where fleeing but I was sad for days and couldn't forget the cries,the trembling of the voices or the bones being crushed and the wagons wheels screeching..\n\nSometimes I still dream it...\n\nSorry for some bad English its not my first language..",

At the age of 22, her future was taken away,\" he added.\nBut Ichihashi’s devastating impact on the Hawker family didn’t stop there.\n\nHe went on to write a book detailing the horrific acts from his prison cell – before offering Hawker’s horrified mum and dad the royalty money, which they refused.\n\nIt sold over 100,000 copies and was a success in Britain – so much so, the story was made into a film 'I Am Ichihashi: Journal of a Murderer'.\n\nToday, Ichihashi remains behind bars to serve out the rest of his sentence.",

        "text": "S…O…S\n\nI stared in disbelief. The stars had started blinking just after midnight — slow, steady, and methodical. Most people are too caught up in their lives to notice the sky, but I was different. \n\nLife had been tough for me. No one stayed around for long. Not my parents, friends, or the few girlfriends I had — they disappeared one by one. I turned to the stars as a refuge. The thought of an infinite universe filled with immense beauty comforted me. Somewhere out there must be someone like me — or so I hoped. \n\nAfter years of calling out to the stars, they were calling back. With a pen and pad in my back pocket, I climbed to my roof and translated the message. Three short bursts of light (S), three extended flashes (O), then back to the triplet of short bursts (S). \n\nThe rest of the town was bathed in darkness. In a rural agrarian town most were early risers, they’d be long asleep by now. I was probably the only one awake who’d be able to receive this message. The rest were blissfully unaware of the events unfolding. I wondered how many other outcasts, with their heads stuck in the clouds, were watching like me.\n\nMy breath was shallow, heart thumping in my chest. Sweat dripped down my brow and soaked my collar. I could barely believe what I was seeing. The universe was shouting in unison, and its message was far from comforting. For the first time in my life, I wished to be looking anywhere but the sky above. \n\nA burning thought burrowed in my mind. Why would the stars be asking to be saved? I could only imagine what they feared — it conjured terrifying images. A universal horror spreading out of control. What in gods name could it be?\n\nThe night sky is a tapestry of the past. Depending on their proximity to earth, it can take anywhere from nine to millions of years for a star's light to reach us. Whoever was sending this message had done so long ago. That didn’t ease my anxiety, if anything it made it worse. It meant we were receiving their cries for help far too late — or was it a warning?\n\nUntil just before dawn, the repetitive blinks continued unabated. I was fixated, staring at the repeating message unblinking. The hours passed like sand running through my fingers. My mind was on fire. An existential dread filled me, unlike anything I’d ever experienced. The universe felt much smaller than before, and that scared me to death. \n\nJust before the sun reclaimed its place in the sky, the stars started to extinguish. It spread across the different galaxies like a plague. One by one they disappeared from view until all that was left was Sirius — the brightest and one of the closest stars to earth. A brilliant flash exploded above me, and then it too was gone. \n\nTrembling, I stared at a blank canvas. It was a new moon that night, so there was no light to be seen. Darkness had taken full control. I shuddered to think what foul creature could have stolen such precious jewels from the sky. I was watching the void of space, the great nothingness, expand at the speed of light. What was hiding in the void? \n\nAs the sun finally rose, my jaw dropped to the floor. I looked on in horror as it too was blinking a familiar message. This time though, there was an additional communication tacked on.\n\n[S…O…S….They’re coming for us next](https://www.reddit.com/r/MidnightProfessor/).",

        "text": "To Death. From the empty void of nothing, you were birthed into existence by radiant light. As the cosmos came into creation, stars were born and then returned to you. From their destruction, came new creation. From the mantle of rock and fire, you watched as life spawned out of the ground and dirt. When animals tore into each other, you stood by and carried the slain to a new world. As man shook off their evolutionary chains, you beguiled as they tried to understand you. \n\nThe blood spilt for you could fill an ocean. The screams that called out to you could write endless symphonies. You have always been there through the aeons. In the minds of men and on the tips of their blades or the barrel of their rifles. Listening, drawing nearer. Reminding us in the dark of your black cloak and your bone hands. \n\nTo Death. The reaper of souls. The taker of vitality. Slowly allowing us to decay until our bodies become grey, broken until we crumble into dust. So sure of our dominion over this life are we Death, that despair grips us when you take us. Shattering our illusion of immortality. Of life. Our foolishness to forsake your divinity. That you gift us the time we so eagerly waste until like Faustus, we wish for just one more minute of it. \n\nBut to you, Death. The ruin of empires. Breakers of legion. Destroyer of worlds. You are not a villain. A fiend. The opposite side of the coin that gifts life. You are both sides of the same. The alpha and omega. Both the light and the dark. Giver of life, and reclaimer of it. \n\nTo Death. You gift a child its first breath, then reclaim them when they have grown old. When their body has withered, you descend on them in their hospital bed with your black feathered wings to carry them off into the world beyond our own. When we scream and cry, and the agony is too much to bear, you hold us tightly in your embrace. You end our suffering. You renew our life. \n\nTo Death. You seed the ground with our bodies for new life to grow. As the sun rises and falls each day. As the meadow flourishes in the summer and dies away with the frosts of winter, to then be reborn in the spring anew. As the cycle of the rains and the tide that ebb and flow in this mysterious wonder of life, so do men too rise and fall, and flowers blossom by their graves. From those flowers, the bees flourish from the nectar bore from us. The deer graze, and birds soar overhead at the break of the golden dawn, as you reclaim us and transcend us onto the next part of our universal journey. \n\nTo Death. You loan us this life until it is time for you to reclaim it for yourself again. Your purpose is not sinister, but sanguine. Your presence reminds us that your gift of life is not permanent, but limited. Through this, we may experience the beautiful totality of wonder, for we know that one day you will come to retrieve us. That the next day is not a guarantee. That the touch of a loved one is fleeting. That falling in love and dedicating our finite years to another is precious because it is temporary. It is by your terms that we live, so we must make our life as such. To not be wasteful with your gift. \n\nAnd for that, Death, I thank you. The pain of loss. The grieving. The despair you bring when you claim back what is yours is a further gift to all, to remind them to hold onto what they have dear. To live each day. To not allow ourselves to suffer unheedingly, so that when you come to claim us and you ask us what we did with the gift you gave, we may look into your loving eyes, smile and say, ‘I did my best, old friend. Now I am yours again.”",

        "text": "No lists of rules, evil A.I.’s, or cursed objects appear in this story. \n\nIt doesn’t take place in a haunted apartment, a supernatural forest, or secret laboratory. \n\nThere aren’t any ghosts or demons, either–\n\nAlthough I suppose you could say that there *are* monsters. \n\nThe year was 2007. It was after midnight on a Thursday night, and my best friend Sean and I had nowhere to go. I was a wannabe writer, he was a wannabe artist, and we had twenty-nine dollars between us that somehow had to buy all our food and gas until the end of the month. That night, we discovered a half-empty bottle of Everclear vodka behind a fake panel in the wall of our apartment: it was like finding buried treasure. We poured it into two bottles along with some expired orange juice–trusting the alcohol to kill off any bacteria–and set out for a walk.\n\nWalking, at least, was free, and those days it was our main recreational activity. \n\nInstead of going through the historic district or out by the meat-packing plant, we headed along one of the many railroad tracks that criss-crossed our town. \n\nWe’d had some close calls before, but we’d always managed to scurry into the bushes when a train came roaring through. So far, anyway. \n\nMaybe it was the booze, but I felt bored with the railroad tracks that night. I wanted to explore one of the gravel roads that led away from the tracks. There were dozens of them, strange little paths that led up into the tree-lined hills or down into the dark gullies behind the tracks. \n\nI picked on at random, and Sean sighed when he saw how steep it was. Fueled by curiosity and vodka screwdrivers, we trudged up into the woods. \n\nWe hadn’t gone far when I began to suspect that maybe, just *maybe,* we’d made an awful mistake. I felt…*watched.* Although I couldn’t see anyone among the dark trees, the hair on the back of my neck was standing up. Goosebumps covered Sean’s arms, and one look in his eyes told me that he was feeling it, too. \n\nWe didn’t dare to speak. A single word might break the spell, causing God-knows-what to come charging at us from the depths of the woods…\n\nHow far were we from town by now? Forty minutes? An hour? Help would never get to us in time if we called for it…and there was no one around to hear us scream. \n\nThere was a heavy, silent, *expectant* feeling to the air, like someone or something was awaiting the arrival of our crunching footsteps. \n\nI couldn’t tell what it was at first: that black shape looming beyond the horizon of the hill. To our overactive imaginations, it looked almost like a ruined castle. \n\nAs it turned out, it was an abandoned rock quarry. \n\nThat feeling of being observed only intensified as we entered the ring of crumbled, graffiti-covered walls and huge machines we couldn’t identify. I felt drawn to the building to the right, but maybe I just wanted to get out of the line of sight of the concrete tower at the far end of the quarry, the one with narrow windows that stared down at us like empty eye sockets.\n\nApproaching the building, Sean and I were hit by a foul smell: a weird mix of diesel fuel, sweat, piss, and something else I couldn’t identify. We turned on the flashlights on our phones and stepped through the doorless entrance.\n\nThe moment I saw the filthy, torn-up clothes and mattresses inside, I wanted to get out of there–and I’m sure that Sean did, too. \n\nBut running meant facing whatever might be waiting for us on the road back, and neither of us were ready for that, not yet. Shaky phone flashlights in our hands, we kept going, stepping over junk half-glimpsed in the dark:\n\nA decapitated teddy bear. \n\nA pink plastic bowl full of maggots.\n\nA long hallway of metal doors.\n\nOne of them screeched as it swung on rusted hinges.\n\n*Was someone else here?* \n\nWe kept going until we reached the end of the hallway, where a concrete staircase led upward. Sean opened his mouth to say something, but stopped when he heard footsteps behind us. \n\nWhoever they were, they could walk just fine in the dark–\n\nAnd they had no trouble staying out of the reach of our dim phone lights.\n\n“H-hello?” I whispered.\n\nThere was no response. Sean and I headed up the staircase, afraid to go forward but even more afraid to go back.\n\nUpstairs, more rusty metal doors. Some of them were padlocked.\n\nFrom behind one, we heard weeping.\n\nIn other rooms, multiple voices held hushed conversations in languages we couldn’t understand. Beneath the door beside us, an orange glow flickered–\n\n*Like firelight.*\n\nThe footsteps behind us grew closer, ratcheting up my nerves until I didn’t dare to turn around–\n\nThe door beside us swung open. Now I saw the source of the orange glow: some burning rags on a broken plate. I caught glimpses, shadows of figures moving inside–\n\nBut most of my attention was fixed on the large, bearded man who burst out of the room, jabbing his finger into my chest and shoving me. Spit flew out between the gaps created by his missing teeth; his breath reeked of vomit and sickness.\n\nRed, wormlike veins stood out on his face as he screamed at me. I had no idea what he was saying, but the meaning was clear: I watched in slow motion as he picked up a chunk of rubble, reared back with it–\n\nThe footsteps that had been following us came running out of the dark. \n\nA dirty, snot-nosed kid tugged on the man’s sleeve. He hesitated for a second–\n\nAnd that was all Sean and I needed.\n\nWe sprinted down the hallway, pursued by eerie echoing shouts and hurled hunks of rock. There was a rickety fire escape at the end of the hall–\n\nWe’d barely started to climb down when headlights appeared on the gravel track below. Something about their brightness made me feel like a hunted animal, and I gestured to Sean that we should hide. Sticks and briars jabbed through our jeans as we climbed up the wooded hillside and squatted down behind a half-rotted log. \n\nThree black vans parked in front of the *“abandoned”* quarry. There was something ominous about the way they left their engines running. Five men got out of the vans and rushed inside the building where we’d found the man and child. Their shadows were long and freakish in the headlights, and while I couldn’t make out their faces, I did catch the glint of a nickel-plated pistol. \n\nMore shouts echoed from inside; we could see flashlight beams dancing in the hollow windows. The five men marched about thirty people out of the ruined building and loaded them into the rumbling vans. The whole thing couldn’t have taken more than five minutes, but I’d swear I saw the kid who’d been following us look up into the hills and give a little nod before disappearing into the darkness of the rumbling unmarked van. I finally understood: the man and boy hadn’t been threatening us–they’d been *warning us.* Trying to get us out of there before it was too late. \n\nWith the vans locked up and ready to go, I got a better look at the five armed men–\n\nAnd what I saw gave me chills.\n\nThey looked…*completely normal.* \n\nA short chubby guy with a goatee, a blonde kid not much older than me who kept checking his phone, an older man with a leathery face and ballcap who I’d seen a few times in the bars around town, and two others with their backs to me–\n\nAll of them calmly smoking cigarettes and telling jokes like they hadn’t just kidnapped dozens of people at gunpoint. One of the men opened a canvas bag he was holding–it looked like it was full of passports and documents–and set fire to them one by one with the tip of his cigarette.\n\nWhen they’d finished their smoke break, they left the smoldering sack on the ground and drove off with their human cargo. \n\nIt was like they were never there. \n\nAlmost half an hour passed before Sean and I dared to move from our hiding spot. \n\nThe same question was on both our minds as we tread carefully down the anonymous gravel road: *what the hell had we just seen?* \n\nI wanted to go to the police with our story, but without any evidence, who would believe us? Besides, as Sean pointed out, we’d have to explain what we were doing on the quarry’s property in the middle of the night, reeking of alcohol. \n\nA few days later, a black-and-white poster in a roadside rest area caught my eye. \n\nI saw two faces I recognized: a pudgy guy with a goatee, and an older man with a leathery face, wearing a ball cap. Both were wanted in connection with a human-trafficking ring.\n\nThey’d brought hundreds of people into the country on false pretenses, destroyed their documents, and shipped them off to work as forced labor–or worse. \n\nSean and I had unwittingly stumbled onto one of the transport hubs of their operation. \n\nI’d always thought that human trafficking was something that happened to people far away: at shipping ports, border crossings, or international airports. I never would have imagined it in the sleepy college town where I lived, but maybe that was the genius of it.\n\nThere are a lot of abandoned buildings in midwestern America. \n\nThere are a lot of gravel roads with no clear end in sight. \n\nIn the quietest of towns–maybe even *your* town–there are a lot of places where evil can hide.   \n\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/beardify)",

        "text": "For as long as I can remember, my family has worked in real estate. And for much longer than that, we have worked alongside the people behind the veil. \n\nBack in the day we were called charlatans because we are mediums. Knowing how to communicate with the dead is a fine art, but certainly not a quantifiable science. After my great grandfather was arrested and died in prison, leaving my great grandmother a widow at 30  and without an anchor at her séances, she decided to clean houses to feed her three small children.\n\nThe problem of course is that if you’re a medium, you’re a beacon. You attract beings from other realms, paranormal objects and the dead whether you like it or not. And often your intuition takes you places and shows you things you never intended to see.\n\nSo the story goes that my great grandmother somehow found herself at house after house with deep, painful histories. A whole family murdered here, a dead child there. She would walk into home after home and as soon as the door opened, the ghosts of each home would rush to her presence, knowing well that she could sense them. \n\nAt some point a lonely, rich old woman who my great grandmother had been cleaning for died and left her the house. The details on this are always a little fuzzy. No one ever says “murder” but no one ever tells the full tale either - they just say the old woman had no relatives and my great grandmother was the closest thing she had to a friend. Either way, my great grandmother inherited a 5 bedroom Victorian. \n\nShe could have moved her children in from their cramped apartment but instead, she decided to fix it up and sell it. The house had three distinctive entities. The old woman herself, the man with no face and the girl made of shadow. My great grandmother struck a deal with the three of them. That they would not scare or kill the next owners for at least 13 years and in return, she would bring them each what they most desired.\n\nWhat can the living possibly offer the dead you may wonder? \n\nWe will get to that.\n\nThe three beings agreed, and everyone kept their word. The first reported sighting of the man with no face was no less than 14 years after the house had been in the hands of the newest owners. \n\nI guess you could say this was where it started. One thing led to another and my great grandmother “inherited” more houses with more sordid histories. Some of the stories my grandmother told me about these houses sent an actual shiver down my spine. But by the time my great grandmother died, she had passed the reigns of the “business” to her daughters who then gave it to their daughters and finally, the business is now run by my sister, my cousin and I.\n\nOur business is now totally legitimate as a real estate agency, by the way. No more dodgy ‘inheritances’ from elderly rich people. My grandmother was the one who put a stop to that. She studied and got her real estate license and set up an above board business. Mom and her sister got their MBAs at universities  and expanded the agency. \n\nI think my mother and her sister just wanted to sell regular houses. New builds. Apartment buildings. They never got those contracts though. \n\nSomehow the houses still found us. They always find us. Wounded houses, houses full of memories and grief that have turned into grudges and then there are the evil houses. The ones that are born bad, crafted with ill intent or built on unhallowed grounds. We were used to strange potential clients walking through our doors at Cornerstone Homes. \n\nWe sit between Rosie’s Café and Jackson Antiques and this has been our office since Grandma bought it in 1967. Now it’s just me and my sister Lora and my cousin Ari who run it after my mother and aunt retired a month ago. \n\nIt’s been oddly quiet. I think the houses are…recalibrating. This isn’t a good thing.\n\nIt’s usually the quiet before the storm.\n\nIt was like this when I sold my first house alone two months ago. It was a 6 bedroom colonial out in Pennsylvania and I had to go and “get it ready” as my family called it. \n\nI remember my heart pounding even as I packed my bag carefully. Salt, sage, sugar, a tiny chest of herbs and oils, a holy book from 5 different religions, holy water from the Vatican and the sacred Ganges in India, crystals for protection, black candles for curses and white for purity, a pistol with silver billets and a gold bullet just in case. Finally a ceremonial knife that had once been dipped in the blood of a Saint. Finally there was the vial of blood only to be used in case of emergencies. \n\nEven with this little armoury of protection, I did not feel safe. \n\nI had only ever watched my mother and sister prep homes. Yes I had helped but it wasn’t me talking to the entities. I wasn’t the one who had to deal with the crueller ones. Or the clean up. \n\nNow it was my turn to do this alone. \n\nI remember checking into my motel quietly, my hands so sweaty, my bags nearly slipping out of my hands. Just as I opened the room door and sat down on the bed, my phone rang. I lifted it to my ear when I saw who it was.\n\n“Have you gone to the house yet?”\n\nIt was my mother. \n\n“Not yet. I just checked in.”\n\n“The faster you get this done the better.” My mother told me, I could hear my sister and aunt’s voices in the background, asking if I had packed everything properly. \n\n“I know.” I said, annoyed. I didn’t like being rushed even though my mother was right. The less time spent in the house, the less chance of my being injured, hurt, trapped or worse, disappeared. \n\nNo one really knows what happens to the people haunted houses take. They sometimes show up as decayed corpses years later. \n\nMostly though, they are never seen or heard from again. I had encountered one of those kind of houses in the past. But that’s a story for another day.\n\nI sighed and rubbed my eyes. Despite the long drive, I knew I had to go to the house now. When these houses are unoccupied, that is when the entities get stronger.\n\nClutching my car keys in my hand, I picked up the bag and walked out of the room.\n\n*\n\nThe house was old. 1650s build. It loomed large behind a rusted old gate which led down a road to the very front of the large white colonial with its grey side-gabled roof. It had two floors and windows which were framed by shutters that opened outwards. The waning sun showed a large garden that was unkempt and overgrown, knee length weeds everywhere and the fountain held two marble statues which I assumed were supposed to be likenesses of Greek Gods but were covered in ivy.\n\nI could hear the voices of the ghosts all the way from here. \n\nA feeling of deep unease was growing inside me as I swung open the rusted gate and it creaked open slowly. Come on, Jo. I muttered to myself. Best foot forward.\n\nAs soon as I stepped onto the road, I heard the voices grow more excited, the whispers grew in their symphony of chaos.\n\nBut below it all, I could hear a few distinctive voices. I couldn’t quite make out what it was saying but I could hear children’s distinctive voices singing a song. \n\nI swallowed hard. \n\nChild ghosts were always the most difficult ones. Their spirits were trapped in these houses because of an unspeakable act. Sometimes the houses keep the children out of misplaced love, other times, it is something far more sinister.\n\nAs I reached the front door, the voices grew deafening.  I pulled out the key and put it in the lock as I winced, I could barely hear myself think. The minute I twisted the key, the voices crescendoed-\n\nAnd then stopped.\n\nThe front door creaks opens into a darkened room. Silence and the feeling I am not alone in this lonely old house fall over me.\n\nI wish I didn’t have to come here in the evening. But the best time for the entities to come out is at night time. And night time is also when they are able to prey best on the living.\n\nIn a way, doing this was setting myself up like bait. The only way to draw a wolf out is to place meat before it and wait.\n\nSlowly, I walked into the house. \n\nEvery footstep made its own quiet little thud. The house was dusty and hadn’t seen the light of day in a while, I could taste it in the stale air. The first thing I did was put my bag down and then walk to open up one of the windows. As I leaned to push the shutters out-\n\n…a large, cold hand grabbed me at the back of my neck. \n\nMy spine felt like it had turned to ice and my heart raced. But I remembered what my mother had taught me. “They feed on fear. Do not scream or cry out or even acknowledge them when they try to scare you. It will only make them more powerful.” \n\nStill feeling the hand gripping the back of my neck, my hands on the shutters, I took a deep, slow breath, willing my heart rate down.\n\nAfter a minute, of hearing only my own heavy breathing, I felt the hand release.\n\nSlowly I pushed open the shutters as I had intended and the last spills of sunlight from a setting sun came into the room. Then I turned slowly, still feeling the impression of the icy cold touch at the back of my neck.\n\nThen I began making my way up to the attic.\n\nThis house was old enough to have experienced a litany of brutalities and scandal to its name. It’s the way of all old houses. The man who had the house built was murdered in his bed on the first night he lived here. It was bought by a wealthy family where the wife developed an fever which affected her mind after her third child was born and drown all three children in a bathtub. At least four more murders had taken place here. And during one of the many parties this house had hosted, a girl had fallen down the stairs and broken her neck.\n\nBut the most haunted place in this house was the attic. Six small children’s dismembered bodies had been found up there two years ago. At the time, no one had been living in the house as it had been bought by a developer. Rumour was that the killer had been experimenting medical procedures on the children \n\nNo one had ever been caught for the murder of these children. \n\nI could hear the noises start again as I climbed up the second flight of stairs. The sense of unease in me grew along with the voice. Quietly I began to chant a Buddhist prayer in my mind to bring myself back to equilibrium.\n\n“Remember they can’t hurt you unless you think they can. Control your fear.” My mother’s teachings came flooding to me. \n\nI wish I could say they instilled more confidence in me.\n\nWhen i got to the attic door, I distinctly smelled it. That old iron whiff of blood. A part of me recoiled realising whose blood it was. The voices were louder now, children singing a soft, unsettling song.\n\n“He told us to run\nBut cut off our feet.\nHe will sneak up behind you,\nCatch you in his teeth.\nHe will leave your flesh\nFor the vultures to eat.”\n\nI really wanted to turn back but I knew that the deal needed to be made. I opened the door and shone the torch inside. There was nothing in there other than an old arm chair and some suspicious looking dark red staining parts of the floor.\n\n“H-hello?” I said, then waited for a response.\n\nNothing at first. The seconds ticked by and I was about to leave and go hunting for some other spirit in the house when a creepy little voice whispered “Hello.”\n\nMy whole body was shivering now, against my best intentions. I shone a torch slowly around the room till I got to the pair of small grey feet. Raising my torch slowly, I almost dropped it when I saw the boy properly.\n\nHe had two faces. One was his own but the other, botched, mottled and eyeless was clearly from someone else: it would have looked like a mask had it not been for the dripping blood. It has been stitched to the side of his face and covered his cheek and ear. \n\nBut the worst part was his eyes. They were completely opaque white. \n\nHis mouth smiled ghoulishly. \n\n“He said you are pretty.” His voice may be soft but there was something deeply wrong with it. \n\nI ignored his words and did what my mother had taught me. Hold the entity’s gaze and say “Let me aid you spirit. I can give you what you need if you give me what I need in return.”\n\nThe boy simply kept smiling ghoulishly, his other face looking even more terrifying when he smiled. \n\n“You are so pretty and he would like to add you to his collection.”\n\nWhat was wrong with its voice? \n\nThe terrible realisation hit me so suddenly, I stumbled backwards. \n\nIt was the voice of a man pretending to be a little boy. \n\nI stuttered this time as I repeated my words. “L-let me aid you spirit-“\n\nThe door behind me slammed shut.\n\nI gasped and turned to it only to find the floor was starting to turn to quicksand. It swallowed my feet up and then turned back to wood, trapping me there. The surprise caused me to make my fatal error: I shrieked.\n\nThe skin crawling chuckle that filled the room made me nearly wet myself. I knew I was in trouble now. I reached quickly into my bag and pulled out the holy water and a vial of blood from my bag. This was a last resort. We were supposed to use this only in case of dire emergency. But as I felt the hands crawling up my back to my throat, I knew I was on limited time.\n\nI stiffened as one of the hands found my throat and started to wrap itself around opening up the holy water and tossing it onto myself. The hands fell away. I tossed the holy water onto my feet but that was no good. The whole time I was there, I could feel something circling me. I tossed the holy water all around me until the bottle was empty. \n\nAs soon as the water was gone, I felt something yank me back by my hair to the point I thought it would tear from my scalp. Terrified I looked up to see it. The boy was crawling on the roof. He was no longer smiling. His jaw distended and black, foul smelling liquid fell from his throat onto my face.\n\nI screamed again, sputtering, my hand clutching the vial of blood. Quickly I wiped my eyes with one arm so I could see the boy and shouted the words, \n\n“In uterum gehennae evanescet et nunquam domum tuam inveniat!”\n\nThen I opened and threw the vial of blood into the boys faces and for a moment, all went still in the room.\n\nWith a loud, demonic roar, the entity lunged for me and I covered my face bracing for impact but-\n\nNothing happened. \n\nWhen I opened my eyes, the entity was gone. \n\nI breathed a huge sign of relief and looked down. My feet had been released from the wood. The attic no longer felt filled with unease and I reached down to pick up my torch which I had dropped in the fray.\n\nQuietly I shone it around once, found nothing and left.\n\n*\n\nThe rest of my time in the house had gone quietly. I smudged each room. I changed prayers and spread salt where I needed to. By the time I was done, the whole house was silent and still and felt empty. Properly, fully empty of anything that could possibly live here. Since no other spirits had met me, I assumed that the attic was the only place I needed to deal with.\n\nAfter staying at the motel overnight, I got up early the next morning to leave. The weather forecast was rain all the way home but I didn’t mind that. I has successfully cleansed and appeased my first haunted house. \n\nHumming to myself as I often did, I left the parking lot in my car, the rain pelting down on the roof. It was only when I was an hour into my drive that I noticed it. The feeling of unease. The sense of dread. The familiar song that I was humming. \n\nBut what solidified it into solid fear was the voice which rose from the empty passenger seat next to me. \n\nThe voice that had terrified me last night and had made my blood curdle. \n\n“He thinks you’re so pretty and he would like to add you to his collection.”",
