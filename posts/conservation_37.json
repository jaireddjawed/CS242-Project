I have a learning disability in math so if you know whether math is required or can be excluded with a diagnoses letter then please let me know. (I am willing to struggle through the class with a tutor for physics or precalc but I won't retain anything, so if it's actually required for the job then it's a no-go.)\n\nI'm currently looking at am Associate of Science Degree with a specialization in Environmental Geoscience, which is 2 years but can be expanded to 4 for a bachelor's. What I really need to know is what will give me the most hands on experience making a difference and working in the field? What has the highest need for employees? I can't travel much for he job itself but can move around BC to find the right one. My girlfriend isn't sure what she wants to do yet but we've already moved together once.\n\nAlso, what are your personal experiences?  What does your job entail? What do you wish you'd be told?\n\nThanks in advance!",

The last week or so I noticed a Goose and Mallard hanging around each other, never leaving or flying.  Upon closer look one day, I noticed the Goose has a broken wing (it's flopped down and can't be held upright by the Goose.  He seems fine besides that. I think the Mallard is healthy, just staying because the Goose is.  \n\nAll the grass is covered and they are out of water to swim on.  I believe they'll either starve or freeze to death as I'm in Winnipeg Canada and our winters are not exactly mild.  I've reached out to Manitoba conservation but can't seem to get any help. \n\nAre these two doomed?  Is there anything I can do to assist? I can't bring them home. Even if I could catch them, my roommate wouldn't have it so that's out of the question.  If I feed them will they live through the cold?  Is there someone I can contact to help them?  Any advice is welcome. I really don't relish the idea of walking by one day to see them slowly dying.",
