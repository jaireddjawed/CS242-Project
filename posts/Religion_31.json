Basically, my mind and body are fine, but my spirit yearns for something to fill it. Is there any way I might be able to balance my scientofoc and spiritual worldviews and find my own faith in spirituality?",

        "author": "CypherFilter",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/religion/comments/zkyq50/the_natural_human_inclination_towards_polytheism/",
        "text": "So I was thinking about this today and am wondering what I'm missing. It is commonly taught in muslim circles that human beings naturally gravitate towards pure monotheism as part of their fitrah. The traditionally taught narrative in Islamic theology is that every community was sent a prophet that taught them monotheism, but when the prophet died, that community corrupted the faith by altering it to their desires and often adding newer or different types of gods into the mix.\n\nThis is what allegedly happened to the Meccans who were originally upon the pure monotheism of Abraham but later devolved into paganism by bringing in idols. Muslims often point out that ancient religions like hinduism also have an ultimate creator God despite them believing in many gods. Christianity has an ultimate God despite them believing in a man being God and being part of a trinity. Many native tribal religions, despite having idols and pagan rituals, also affirm some kind of ultimate creator-god.\n\nBut here's the thing. If God has to constantly intervene into the natural world and send down prophets to artificially force a change in human behavior, doesn't that prove that polytheism is actually more natural than monotheism? God is constantly sending messengers because every times humans are let alone to do their business, they naturally turn towards idol worship and paganism. It's only when their is divine interference and threat of punishment do humans change their behavior into monotheism because they obviously don't want to burn for eternity. If God never intervened and let human civilization run its course, then most people would be polytheists.\n\nSo what am I missing? Isn't pure monotheism the least natural religion then?",

        "text": "I'll summarize. Me and Muslim friend were talking about the afterlife, and I learned what the Islamic version of Heaven is like. It's basically a place where you can't feel any negative emotions at all. This sounds completely horrifying to me, and was wondering if I misunderstood something, or if other people feel the same way?\n\nHe told me that, basically, I would be able to remember negative memories and bad things that happened to me, but I'd never be able to *feel* them. If I remembered a dead loved one for example, I wouldn't feel happy, but since I couldn't feel sadness, I'd feel basically nothing. I told him, \"That sounds horrible!\" and he said, \"Well you wouldn't even be able to feel horrible about it.\"\n\nI can't imagine how anyone actually looks *forward* to a place like that. It seems far more like some sort of twisted Hell than anything else. While I would never wish negative feelings on anyone, I believe they make us human, and I feel good after remembering bad things, because they made me who I am today, and I'm proud of that. And I'd also still like to feel sadness over lost loved ones.\n\nI asked my friend a hypothetical. I said, \"What if there was a pill that made you only feel happy emotions, and everyone (on Earth) was forced to take it?\" And he agreed that it would be a bad thing and a violation of human rights. But for some reason, he wouldn't agree with me that his version of Heaven is *literally the same scenario*. He just said, \"We're humans on Earth, we're not humans in Heaven. So it's different.\" Great, so I'm not even human anymore.\n\nI dunno... It just sounds awful to me. It's not something I would ever consent to while alive on Earth, so I don't think it's right that something like that would be forced on me. I mean, as an Agnostic who is aware of Islam but refuses its teachings, I'm not going to their Heaven even if it does exist. But wow... maybe that's a good thing.\n\nI mean I get it, I wouldn't even be *capable* of feeling bad about it once I was there, but then I might as well not be me at that point. I might as well be a copy of myself with some emotions erased and some memories altered. Because I believe memories and emotion need to go hand-in-hand. If I remember a sad memory but no longer feel sad, it's not the same memory. And without my memories as I had them on Earth, I wouldn't even be \"me\" anymore.",

We always said we would let our kids explore religion if they chose to and suddenly my 9 year old wanted to go to a church. We asked if there was a reason and she said no, but followed up with a lot of questions about God.\n\nWe agreed to take her to a church but we would pick one as we wanted one that is accepting of everyone and didn’t teach discrimination against certain groups, specifically LGTB+. We found one and I took her yesterday and everyone was very nice and she prayed along with everyone else and afterwards said she wanted to continue going. I, however felt pretty uncomfortable as I don’t believe in Jesus being the son of God, and going to a church seemingly praying to him seems disrespectful to the congregation. So, all this said, what advice to others have to support my child’s journey no matter where it takes her while also being mindful of my and my wife’s feelings towards religion?\n\nThanks!",

He (Manny) my mom and a couple other ladies became friends back in the 90s as bilingual (Spanish) elementary school teachers in a large immigrant (Mexican/Central American) community in Southern California. All of them are Hispanic/Latino and raised Catholic. They always knew Manny was gay but in the closet because A) as a teacher, he was scared of school parents thinking the worst and B) his intolerant mother who he loved (he didn’t come out until she died and he retired in his late 60s). \nSo my mom and friends are devastated by this loss, and want a service of some sort, but don’t know if his surviving family will have one. He never had a known parter and closest family member is a niece (who is also a boomer, because he was the youngest child of a mom who gave birth from age 19 to 43) and she says he “didn’t want anything”.\n\nAround the same time he came out, he also left the Catholic Church and became Buddhist. My mom doesn’t know if he attended a temple or if he just meant he practiced meditation at home. Either way, even though my mom and friends are Catholic and all they know is traditional funerals, they know and respect his wishes to not have one. \n\nBut they are grieving and want to get together in shared grief but don’t know what to do. I suggested maybe going to a Buddhist temple and doing.., I don’t know!?? I’m realizing I myself am ignorant as to how Buddhists handle death. I’ve been to the Hsi Lai temple in Hacienda heights which is beautiful, maybe they can do something there? Or is that incredibly disrespectful? Honestly I know my mom and her friends mean well and are trying to do the right thing so I’m asking advice on their behalf.",

        "text": "My name is Tirtha,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am a lifelong monk, currently, I live in an ashram in New York, and I want to share my story. Since monks don’t usually do that, I thought maybe this would inspire someone or at least would be interesting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always believed in God. Although my family wasn’t very religious, I considered myself a Christian. Later, doubts and questions about Christianity entered my heart. I had questions that could not be answered. The more I asked the more confused I would get. Yet, instead of answers, I would receive chastisement, “Have faith in God…” The history of the Christian church also didn’t increase my faith. Gradually, I started looking for answers elsewhere.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI practiced Buddhism for some time when I was younger. Buddhism helped me a lot, yet still, after hours of meditation, I would ask myself, \"Why? Why am I doing this?\" Buddhism was not enough for me. I didn’t want to annihilate my soul and be nothing. I wanted a relationship with the Supreme, impersonal philosophy was too dry for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also was tired of the watered-down spirituality that is so prominent in the West. No one could answer my questions and doubts, not even Buddhism, although mentally I was still very attached to the teachings of their philosophy. The laws of karma and reincarnation were a great revelation to me. Buddhist philosophy made way more sense than the Christian \"Burn in hell forever for your sins\" philosophy. But I was missing Christianity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was raised as a Christian, and I must say, there is something so special about churches. Ever since I was a little kid, I would always find peace in them. Now, I was longing for that feeling, that personal connection with God. I wanted Jesus to be my friend, I wanted Him to talk to me. I wanted to feel His presence like I would when I was just a little kid. I was looking for God, I was praying to Him, but I could not find Him. I could only feel Him, therefore I could not find peace in my prayers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGrowing up I didn’t have real friends; nobody could understand my heart. In school and in parties I would always put on a mask. I would pretend that I was one of them, the cool kid, but in my heart, I knew that I was not. I knew I never would be. I would hang out with the popular kids because I was afraid of missing out. But gradually, I realized that everyone is suffering. Everyone is lost and confused. I saw how meaningless the things that ‘cool kids’ cared about were. Wealth, popularity, status, external beauty, and so on… As I got older, my so-called friends started noticing that I am different from them. As I was maturing, I started to be more confident, I started being myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI never have drunk alcohol or smoked in my life, although I was surrounded by people who were always engaged in those things. Drinking, smoking, parties, drugs, sex, sleep, repeat. I never judged others for doing those things. But in my heart, I had this conviction that I would never do that. Maybe I was a drunkard in my past life because I never had any taste for those sorts of things. Eventually, my so-called friends got tired of me. I became like a thorn to them, not smoking and drinking made them feel guilty. I stopped going to parties and they stopped inviting me. Now I was alone, but it felt as if a rock had been lifted from my heart. I didn’t have to pretend anymore. It was a liberation, I felt as if God Himself arranged that. As if He wanted me to embrace who I really was. But who am I? I still wasn’t sure. But now, I was more eager than ever to find out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started experimenting, doing things I have never done before. Spending money on self-help courses, and going to different spiritual events. I became more open about who I was and started performing in public speaking events, like slam poetry, stand-up, etc. I was writing and reading a lot. Everything changed I felt as if spring has finally come to my life. Yet, I still felt that calling inside my heart. God was calling me. He was waiting for his lost child. But I couldn’t find him. I needed a way to communicate with him. I couldn’t speak his language. I was never attracted to Islam or Judaism; I had lost faith in Christianity and now I was losing faith in Buddhism. I saw truth in all those philosophies, yet it seemed that they were all incomplete, at least for me. I always had great respect for anyone who is trying to advance on their spiritual path, but I couldn’t find my own path. I think religions are like languages that were created solely to communicate with God. So far, the languages I knew felt incomplete. I couldn’t fully express myself. I was in a critical stage. I felt that something big is going to happen to me…\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is when I went to a Masters of Calm weekend event in Lithuania where I met the happiest and the most beautiful group of people in my life. I felt so attracted to them, “Why are they so happy? What is wrong with them? They must be hiding something” These thoughts couldn’t’ leave my mind. I wanted to become friends with them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne day, over sixty people were sitting in a big hall. The leader of the event was leading a group session in which he was trying to show the power of a community. The concept was very simple. Whoever wanted could raise their hand and stand up in front of everyone. Then the person would reveal a desire or a dream that they have in their heart and the rest of the people would try to help them. Only a few people were brave enough to do that. People were sharing their knowledge, giving advice, and providing useful contacts. Imagine a coaching session with sixty people trying to help you. It was a truly powerful experience witnessing that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly, I also decided to stand up. I felt as if God wanted me to reveal my heart. I raised my hand, stood up, and said: “I want to go and live in a monastery in India” There was a long pause. Now, I was standing alone with sixty pairs of eyes staring at me. I was completely at their mercy…\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFour hours later I was in a temple in Vilnius, the capital city of Lithuania. Turns out the people I was so attracted to were Hare Krishnas. Who would have thought… I had seen Hare Krishnas before, dancing and singing on the streets. But I had never read about their philosophy, I thought that they are just crazy happy people. Turns out I was right, they are crazy, and they are happy. But they are crazy and happy for God. In the temple, Hare Krishna devotees introduced me to the bhakti yoga philosophy and I felt that I finally found my place… Words can’t explain what I felt there. The lost son finally came back home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBhakti yoga was the only path that could really answer my questions and where I had no doubts about whether the teachings were true or not. From the very first moment I was convinced that this was THE path, at least for me. I won’t even try to explain what experiences I had in that temple. My heart was captured, and I don’t think I will ever get it back. It was the first time in my life that I experienced real love. Love and be loved, it’s so simple, yet somehow, we, as humans, always find ways to overcomplicate things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBhakti yoga is based on service. With our word’s actions and mind, we are always trying to serve God. We are His children, and our relationship with Him is inherent. But we have forgotten Him… T\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYes, eventually I did go to India and spent some time living in a temple there. Yet, my teachers wanted me to live and serve in the U.S. Out of love for God I became a monk and have taken a life-long vow to follow celibacy. Being a monk is not easy, but it's the most meaningful thing I could have done with my life. Love is service and service is love.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, for the last year and a half, I have lived in a temple in NY. I am a monk and I have never been happier in my life. I have found my path, God called me, and I answered. I hope that everyone will find their path. I know that God is calling everyone, He is waiting for us. Everyone has a different relationship with God. There are so many paths, but the goal is one. We are all children of God. Like rivers meet in the ocean we all will meet in His Kingdom. But each river is different, it has its own beauty and specialty. Each path is different, but isn’t that beautiful?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone has any questions or wants to learn more about bhakti yoga, please don’t hesitate and ask me here or privately\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYour humble servant, Tirtha",

From incense and singing bowls, to icons and entheogens, to musical instruments and microphones and more. I'm curious as to ways that more modern and cutting edge tech might be implemented toward this purpose, perhaps to even optimize the processes. For instance, have you heard of [The God Helmet](https://www.god-helmet.com/wp/)? It uses electromagnetic radiation to stimulate the temporal lobe, which can produce a variety of mystical experiences in users. Why not use something like this, say in communal meditation, or in prayer?\n\nI think there could be a pretty radical frontier here, given the way technological development is accelerating. If you have other ideas like this, or know about people doing any of this sort of work, please share.",

He goes by the classic “you’re in my house, so you’ll live by my rules” which is fair most of the time. Growing up he always had me and my siblings attend church and youth groups, which seemed fun at the time. However, ever since I’ve turned 18, I’ve personally grown out of going to church and worshipping God, not to say I don’t believe, but I’m just not much of a faithful person. Every time the discussion pops up with my dad about my views, he completely disregards them, and gets heated, even threatening to kick me out because I don’t want to go to church every Sunday morning. Again, I understand that I am under his roof, but religion should be completely separate from his rules. He never gave me or my siblings a choice in going to church, he had us going before we could even walk or think for ourselves. THAT is indoctrination, I should have a choice, especially now since I am a grown adult. He seemingly doesn’t care about my thoughts or feelings on the matter, and now every Sunday morning I wake up in anger because he’s made going to church feel like a chore. My brother and sister think it’s insane, even calling my dad a narcissist, which isn’t 100% false. The cherry on top is that he takes me to a mega-church, which almost definitely pockets the donations from the hundreds of other people who attend. I’m not really looking for a solution or advice, the only thing I can do is bite the bullet until I can move out. I just needed to get this out in some way because I let all this frustration build up and it damages my mental state. Feel free to leave your thoughts.",

Some of these faith communities have histories that stretch back hundreds of years.\n\nTo hear people celebrating or even seeing this as a positive in the year 2022 is quite shocking. We have made significant moral progress in other related areas. We understand that we have to respect other people's cultures, and a demographic shift that leaves historical communities vulnerable to disappearance is beyond troubling. Ireland is to this day grappling with the decline of Gaelic speaking communities, and to celebrate that fact would be frowned even in many pro-monarchy English corners.\n\nHow is it not xenophobia to celebrate the decline of historical communities, let's say English Christians, in the year 2022?\n\nI personally think that most of the angry comments celebrating this unfortunate demographic change comes from New Atheists, who, ignorant of anthropology and psychology of religion, falsely teach that religion is not part of culture, behaviour and tradition the way languages and other markers of identities are. However, ignorance is not an excuse for bigotry.\n\nAnd dear New Atheists, here is another reason to quit your hate cult: it promotes bigotry through ignorance, the very thing you are supposed to be fighting with Sagan quotes.",

With that said and for the sake of keeping it short, I had a rough upbringing. I've always had angry issues (diagnosed with BPD) so I'm not exactly sure what I was so mad about anymore, but I was having a very very hard time. Throughout this breakdown I was being spiteful speaking directly to God, saying very nasty things. There is no other way to explain this other than simply saying god spoke to me from within my head, as I didn't hear what he said through my ears... in the most powerful thunderous foreign voice I heard the word \"NOOOOO\" For the record, I was home alone, and this is why this particular experience stuck with me. This shook me so deeply I will never forget the power of this voice. I immediately felt regret and sorrow for being spiteful directly towards God amd truly meaning what I said.\n\nWhen I was roughly 13-14 my best friend at the time invited me to church camp, his mom was one of my many chosen mothers who truly cared for me. She paid my way so I have her to thank for this experience... I wasn't veiwed as religious at this time in my life, and my interest were far from God. With that being said, I decided during a group prayer/sermon that I would close my eyes and search deep into myself for faith. This was this first time I truly searched for God. In the same instant that I truly believed, I, for the lack of better terminology, blacked out amd fell to the floor. When I realized what happened (10-20 seconds after collapsing) everyone in that group were surrounding me, praying over me and congratulating me. I felt blissful and truly happy. Everyone in the group attested that I spoke in tongues and seemed as if I was having a seizure on the floor. (I don't have any medical conditions that would cause this) Looking back on this experience over the years, I've come to view this happening as the holy spirit and I collided. I felt the holy spirit. My best friend at the time, who I mentioned earlier, did not believe me because I wasn't a very religious person. I wouldn't be able to recreate what happened &gt;TO&lt; me so I know in my heart this wasn't something I did as a prank or whatnot. \n\nI hope that me sharing my experiences help someone out there who is going through their own trials and tribulations, I hope me sharing brings someone out there a little bit closer to accepting God as true and holy. I hope me sharing my experiences with the world allows me to forgive myself for the many many sins, and that it allows me to find the courage to ask for God's forgiveness.",

        "text": "I feel like there's a lot of NDE's in which, after similar experiences of bliss, weightlessness, bright lights, tunnels, ease of pain, etc, the person experiences what they believe to be the Christian Heaven (or sometimes an entrance of some kind to Heaven), and some even go in detail of what Christian Heaven is like, seeing passed relatives, angelic beings, and sometimes even Jesus.\nWhat I wonder is if there's any cases of these similar experiences, modern or ancient or anything in between, where a person has an NDE and experiences beings or places of other theologies? Has anyone said to see Moses, Zoroaster, Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), a Buddha or Bodhisattva, Vishnu or Shiva, or be in any of the Heavens or Heavenly Planes of these traditions, or even places like the Underworld, Elysium, Valhalla, Helheim/Hel, the Duat, Field of Reeds, Shiv Loka, etc?",

Even though the percentages are respectively 2.5%, 10% and 1%\n\nOr is it the fact that so many different types of diseases, disasters, calamities and just bad times people could go through?\n\nOr was it just your personal experience that convinced you that this world is evil\n\nP.S: I wish my words don't trigger anyone, and I am extremely sorry if they do.",

Topics discussed include cultural vs biological adaptation, the Agricultural Revolution, Theory of Mind and its over-application, Dunbar's Number and social cognition, concrete versus abstract thinking, and how we move from the simple, localized and concrete to the sophisticated, generalizable and abstract. Persons cited include Pascal Boyer (Professor, atheist, and leading scholar of the cognitive science of religion), Graham T. Allison (Professor, political scientist), and Daniel Quinn (author of \"Ishmael\"). The case being made is compatible with both atheism and theism. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/svX23yERuyo",
