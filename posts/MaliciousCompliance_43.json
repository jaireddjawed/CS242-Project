        "text": "My sister had this friend named Jillian. Some people have resting bitch face. She had resting bitch personality. I would just say hi and she'd act as if I had been annoying her for the last hour, and really snobbish.\n\nMy sister had a group of her friends over to make posters for a club one night. I walked out of my room to see Jillian going into the restroom. For some reason, the toilet in that restroom was becoming really weak. Basically, you could only pee and use very little toilet paper or it wouldn't flush all the way. So I asked,\n\n\"Jillian, are you using this restroom?\"\n\n\"Uh, yeah, what else would I be doing?\"\n\n\"Um, the toilet in this one is kind of-\"\n\n\"*sigh*, can you just fuck off?\"\n\nSo I did. I walked back in my room and waited. After like 10 minutes I heard the toilet flush. Then again. And again. I knew what had happened. She walked out without saying anything, maybe to try and feign ignorance, but I went into the restroom *coincidentally* right at that moment. She looked very panicked.\n\n\"Oh gosh, Jillian, you didn't flush!\"\n\n\"I did, it's not my fault, it wouldn't go down. Just use the other restro-\"\n\n\"I was trying to tell you this earlier. It's ok, don't worry about it.\"\n\nMy parents were on one side of the house, we were on the other, and everyone else was between in the living room. So I shouted at the top of my lungs so both my parents and all of my sister's and Jillian's friends could hear:\n\n\"MOM! DAD! JILLIAN CLOGGED THE TOILET! IT'S BAD THIS TIME!\" \n\nShe got mad and started to say something to me but it was too late. We heard everyone in the living room start to laugh. Maybe if she was one of the friendly, humorous people it wouldn't have mattered much, but she was one of those girls who cared all about her appearance and attitude. She called me an idiot and just left the house and drove home.\n\nLuckily not all my sister's friends are that mean so I went outside and helped them for a little, as they were now short one person, while my dad cleaned the bathroom.",

        "text": "I am truly sorry for leaving out the follow up. It was a painful hour of my life that seamed tedious and boring at the time, but what the public demands the public gets.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI knew I was riding the line hard with this one, it was definitely one of those better to ask for forgiveness than for permission situations. I did inform my coworkers and my manager the situation, but waited until after the deed was done. I didn't want to leave any one hanging when the fecal matter hit the rotary impeller. So we had a plan of action ready, we call it informed ignorance. After completing the work on the computer I called up the offending client.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMe: Hi there, this is “enter caned company greeting” Your computer is finished, when would you like me to schedule the pickup appointment?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nVillain: I don't have time for that. I will just grab it when I get off work.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMe: Well, what time do you get off work. I can set some time aside for you so we can go over what was done, and answer any questions you may have.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nVillain: Look I said I don't have time for that, just have it ready for me when I come in so I can grab it and go.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt was actually the next day when our malefactor came in and signed for the now like new computer. The part that saved my bacon from any career ending fallout was the paperwork he signed had a space for documenting any damages or requests for follow up work to be done. By signing that paper without reading it he basically gave me a liability shield and was still clueless as to what was done. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBecause I did a fresh OS install and nothing else when he first turned on the computer it would have taken him to the setup process. I would have loved to see the look on his face when he got the “Hi I'm Cortana a bit of sign in here a dash of wifi there and you will be ready for all you plan to do.” My shift was almost over when he picked up the computer, so I decided to stay late that day to see if he would come back or not. Sure enough almost two hours later, I was in the back working on some other units when I hear a booming voice, “I want to see the little expletive deleted that worked on my computer!” So I plaster on my best happy face and walk out.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMe: Welcome back! How's the new computer treating you?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nVillain: Don't give me that expletive deleted. Where are all my files?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMe: I'm sorry sir, I don't understand.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nVillain: My spreadsheets, I have an important presentation in a few days and I need the spreadsheets that were on my computer.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNow this went on for quite some time with me playing the ignorance card, but I did finally find out what his original problem was. Excel would open then close right away every time he tried to open one of his spreadsheets.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMe: Oh that's an easy fix. There is a tool built into Office to fix that issue. Takes about ten minutes to run. If you had made a reservation for some time to explain that I could have had you in and out in no time. You didn't fill any of that in on the paperwork, you just asked me to reset the device so that is what I did.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nVillain: I never told you to reset my device!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMe: The work order that you filled out said you wanted the device back in like new condition. But hey this is a easy fix. Bring in your backup and I would be more than happy to restore your files!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nVillain: I don't have any backups! \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMe: Oh (sad face) I'm so sorry to inform you that those files are gone now, there is no way to recovery them.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis is where the volume and color of the language went into the red zone and my manager stepped in. There was a lot of yelling and threats made, and honestly I kinda zoned out for a bit so not sure what more there is to tell. The cantankerous client did get a free 1TB external drive and set up for auto backups. The best part is I never reinstalled Excel so I hope he remembers his MS Live password or he will need to re-buy a license key.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Follow up from this post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/8dm1mf/like_new_yes_sir/)",

        "text": "When I go to my first duty station in the Army years ago, there were frequent urinalysis (drug test, piss test, UA, or whatever you want to call it) because we were stationed in Germany and very close to the border with the Netherlands. A lot of Soldiers were going to Amsterdam and using drugs or bringing them back. Typically we would get a call or someone would knock on your barracks room door in the morning before PT and tell everyone where to be for the test. \n\nI went out the night before because I had the following day off, so when I got back to the barracks I was told about the test and stumbled my drunk ass to the testing site. When it was my turn to go, I had been holding it for a while and really had to go. The observer for the test was my Squad Leader, and he was very by the book, but to the point of annoyance. He could tell I was drunk and he didn’t seem pleased but I was off and there was nothing he could do about it. \n\nHe reads off the instructions about providing a sample and states that he needs to see the urine leave my body and go into the bottle. Most observers don’t do this, they just ensure that you don’t have any tubing or liquids on you so you can cheat on the test. But he decides to go above and beyond and he leans up against the wall by the toilet facing me so that he can see the fluid go body to bottle. So, in my drunken state, I decide to make it easier for him. \n\nI pulled my t-shirt up over my head to fully expose my stomach and below, and then I dropped my pants and underwear to my ankles and I began pissing in the bottle. I guess I embarrassed him because he ran out of the bathroom yelling “oh my god, what are you doing?” I replied “I was making sure that you could see it go from body to bottle. He stood outside the door until I was done and then attempted to yell at me for what I’d done, but when he realized that I fully complied with his request and the guidelines of the test all he could do was walk around pissed off. \n\nAfter that, he never volunteered to be an observer again. \n",

        "text": "So I work for a IT company that provides computer support for the general masses. About 40% of my business is cleaning up peoples computers after they get a virus or 50. The other 60% of my time is spent educating my clients that yes they do in fact have a password for their email/Facebook/iTunes, and that if they want me to set their computer up I will need it. No I don't know what your password is. No I cant just look it up. No I cant just give you a new one. Yes you do need to answer these personal questions. No I don't know who your favorite band is.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBecause of this a lot of the interactions take 20-30 min so we have an appointment system that allows us to focus on one issue at a time. Enter the antagonist stage left.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI'm about 5 min into a appointment setting up an older lady's new phone (Yes I know you didn't need to type in the password on the old phone, but we need to teach your new phone the password so it can get your email.) When a man came in pushing his way in front of the woman I was talking to and shoves a laptop in my face telling me to fix it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYes sir I would love to help you with your computer, but I am currently helping another client. I have a free appointment slot in three hours. Let me set that time aside for you and we can go over the details and make sure we have the information we need to do it right the first time.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThree hours! I'm just here to drop it off and have you fix it. I'm not coming back until its done.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThere is about 5 minutes of back and forth like this that I wont bore you with. What I did was pull out a service order sheet to have him fill in while I go back to helping our damsel in phone distress. The villain of our story took about one minute filling in the form and then says “Don't call me until it's done.” and storms out.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhen I finish up with the phone and take a look at the paperwork. Nature of the problem: Blank. Computer login Password: Blank. Commonly used programs: Blank. Definition of fixed: “I want it to work like new.”\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNow what I am supposed to do in this situation is call the client and get the information I need, but the client was very clear that he didn't want to be called unless it's done, and the clients definition of done is when it's like new. Well the client is always right, so how do you define like new? New laptops don't have personal data on them, so lets purge the drive, reformat, and install a fresh OS. I opened it up and used compressed air to blow it out and did a very thorough physical cleaning. That bad boy sparkled when I was done with it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe follow up would triple the length of this already too long story so the short of it my manager shows the service order sheet and asks “Is this your handwriting? The check box requesting data backup is blank along with any form of instructions on what you wanted done. Is this your signature at the bottom? Does the computer work? Then I don't see a problem. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAfter the persona non grata had left, my manager turns to me and says “I get it, but never do that again.” and proceeds to give me a fist bump.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Added a follow up post for those that want it] (https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/8dphji/like_new_yes_sir_part_two/)",

        "text": "So lately my parents and I have been having some heated arguments because they don't agree with me living with my boyfriend because they think it's causing distractions from school. They are currently helping me with college funds, but it's constantly \"you have to be super grateful to us we are doing so much for you and therefore you need to do all of this for us\" type of thing. To be honest I've been pretty close to just taking out a loan for the rest of school so they stop hanging their contribution over my head. \n\nLately we had a discussion where I was expressing my concern that my major wasn't for me. I go to an engineering school and am having an issue with a class because I keep numbering wrong. To be honest lately I've been doubting myself and with finals coming up I just haven't been too optimistic toward the future because I'm not even sure if engineering is the right pathway. During this conversation my father told me that \"I should just drop out and become a house wife\" referencing the fact that earlier in the day I'd taken my boyfriend's parents to Costco because they wanted to see what all the fuss with Costco was about. That has fueled them to be pushing me to give them access to my school transcripts.\n\nNow for all you in college, you know that you can usually access your school unofficial transcript for free online - but ordering costs money. Yesterday I got a text from them going \"If you do not go to school and sign the paper to give us access then we will cut all funding and kick you out of the house/write you out of our will.\" Keep in mind these are the people that stalked my past apartment so that they could prove that I was letting my friend stay over for several nights each week since I didn't really live there - and then accused him of stealing from me since I wasn't asking him to pay rent? There's a ton of horror stories.\n\nNow after that text I reaaallly wanted to go take out a loan for the rest of my schooling but my friend brought up a good point that the only thing they can do is see my transcripts (I assumed it would give access to my full online account where they could register me for classes ect). Now I have no issue with them seeing my grades, I send the grades to them every semester and I've let them see my transcript though my account - but no way was I giving away my password so they could check my grades/do whatever shenanigans they wanted. I don't know if they assumed I was using my AMAZING power of telekenisis to like hack the school system and change my grades so they would be shown better grades, or if they thought that I was PHOTOSHOPPING my transcripts but with them, who the fuck knows.\n\n Anyways today I talked to the registrar and turns out yes, they can have access to my transcripts and only those, but they have to pay 15$ every time to get an official transcript. I signed it gleefully and sent them the information - because apparently if they don't trust me and think I'm going to SOMEHOW change my grades when they look at it, then tbh they deserve to pay the fee to order an OFFICIAL transcript every semester because fuck them. Instead of just freaking asking \"hey can we see your transcripts\"\n\nTl;Dr my parents are going crazy and think I'm editing my transcript so they wanted access to order an official transcript, so I gave it to them.",

Part of the system I have, is that the students change small bills for larger denominations, this enables me to not have runaway inflation. There was a time that I did not do that, and I gave out five dollar bills until I corralled the singles. This tidbit is useful in understanding the students' thought process...\n\nA few days ago, I realized I was running out of singles and, using superb observational skills, I noticed two students with a gigantic stack of singles. They knew the drill, and they were not following through with it. Fast forward to today, and I am critically low in singles. Another student jumps on the bandwagon - after me asking him for his singles for which I can give him larger bills, he answers, \"No, I only want singles.\" I smiled and moved on.\n\nAlas, I ran out of singles. However, their plan did not quite work...\n\nI circulated among the class, handing out five dollar bills, as I had no more singles - and skipped over those three students. Not once, not twice, but FIVE times. Suffice it to say, they were not enthused. A common refrain was, \"Why can't we get fives?? We're doing our work!!\" I called for attention in the class and made an announcement, \"There are some students that are upset that they are not getting any money. I feel terrible, I don't have any more singles, and they ONLY WANT SINGLES!\" The class burst out laughing.\n\nI had my singles back before the period was over.",

I'm afraid all our tables are reserved for tonight, but you're more than welcome to take a seat at the bar if you like, while you choose if you would like to go somewhere else?'\n\nBI 'What about that table over there, (pointing to the birthday table) that's got 8 seats, we'll just sit there!'\n\nMe 'Sorry, that table is reserved for another family, they're due here any minute, if you wait at the bar, we have a 30 min policy, so if the family doesn't turn up, you can take their table'\n\nBI 'Well none of these empty tables have 'reserved' signs on them, so how are we meant to know? Can you not push those two together for us? (Pointing to two tables that weren't even in the same area!)' \n\nBig Idiot then spots my manager walking past, and grabs her arm to speak to her (which went down about as well as a fart in a lift!)\n\nBI 'EXCUSE ME, there is a table over there that we would like to sit at, but this GIRL here won't let us sit there, we travelled half an hour to get here, and I'm not happy! They don't have any signs on to say they are reserved, so I don't understand!'\n\nMy manager, without missing a single beat says 'I'm sorry about that Sir, please wait a second while I sort this out, I won't be long'\n\nBig Idiot is looking pretty pleased with himself at this point, puffs out his chest and gives me the smuggest look he's probably given anyone. Until he spots my manager walking out, with the little reserved signs in her hand (our restaurant used to be self seating), she walks over to my station, checks the diary, and walks over to each empty table, and places a sign on each one, and walks back over to the station.\n\nManager 'I'm sorry our system confused you Sir, I have now rectified it, I see we have have a free table tomorrow evening, at the same time if you would like to come back then?'\n\nBig Idiot turned the most putrid shade of puce you've ever seen in your life, and stated he will sit at the bar and wait to see if the table cancels, and as they're walking, the birthday table of 8 walks in.\n\nBig Idiot huffs, and beckons his family to leave, at which point, my manager calls over 'If you would like that table for tomorrow, please give us a call, have a nice evening!'\n\nOh sweet, sweet Karma...\n\nTL;DR Idiot thought he could bully his way to a table, my manager took matters into her own hands",

He worked for a small company that sold IT monitoring solutions. \n\nHe had a cheap customer (CC) that really didn't want to pay a cent more than he had to. \n\nNormally Ted would setup the system, including changing the standard settings into something useful, setting thresholds, making standard policies and so on. Then do a scan of the infrastructure, clean it up and present it in a view on a large screen. Let it run for a while and come back later and tweak it.\n\nOver the years the company he worked for had created a whole lot of scripts to help setup the system based on years of experience. \n\nTed tried to tell CC this and it would only take a couple of hours to do a baseline for the system, otherwise it would just report on everything and that would make the system worthless.\n\nCC wouldn't have any of it and told Ted to do the scan and make the system report tickets to the incident system. CC would just Google-Fu the rest instead of paying top $$ for Ted to do it.\n\nTed did as requested, and made sure that everything got reported into the incident system. Friendly and helpful as Ted is he asked if CC wanted a mail sent to his mail for each report sent to incident system, just to make sure everything was as expected, and at no extra cost. And yes CC would like that, and Ted happily obliged. \n\nThis happened a friday, monday CC called Ted back and told him to come ASAP to setup the system as Ted had proposed. Ted told me that while the incident system didn't crash during the weekend, the frontend was so slow that it was basically useless. So CC' Google-Fu didn't quite got the system up and running, but he did ruin alot of settings, so Ted had to clean up the mess before fixing it. While Ted was there another consultant was there to fix the incident system. \n\nCC got his mailbox filled and a incident filled with useless alerts, lost almost a full days use of the incident system, and ended up with paying for two consultants.

I went and talked to the guy responsible for the data entry tool and we fixed it so people couldn't enter bad data. And I opened up a problem ticket with our data team about the bad data and included the query they could use to find the data.\n\nThe next day, the data team closed the ticket with a note saying it was \"too general\" and they could only address specific instances of bad data.\n\nI thought about that for a little bit and remembered that our problem ticket system has a nice little JSON interface. After about an hour of hacking around in Python I had a program that created a ticket for every single instance of bad data.\n\nNow the data team has 45,000 individual tickets that are very specific. It's taking them a while to clear because you can't automate the closing of tickets.",

I decided to let him go with it, because I had in bold and large font, my first and last name right at the top of the document. The teacher asked us for our work, and I provided my printed sheets. Then she asked the other kid, who reluctantly opened the file that I had typed up on the computer, and in bold letters, my name shone gracefully on the computer screen.\n\nThat was one of the most gratifying feelings.\n\nThe kid ended up getting a 0 on the project, and failing the after school program.

She was very committed to this analogy, which to be fair wasn't a bad one. \n\nSo when we had to turn in our assignments, she asked a few of us to read our updated parables in class. I volunteered and proceeded to read a word for word copy of the original parable with a find/replace applied to change \"Samaritan\" to \"Mormon.\" Surprisingly, she didn't seem bothered by this blatantly low effort submission, and smiled and nodded through the entire thing. That is, until I got to the end and mentioned that the kind Mormon assigned 50 of his wives to take care of the injured stranger.

        "text": "Some of you who have read my previous posts know that I'm a lawyer, it's the topic of my stories.  But I haven't always been a lawyer, I was a law student once.  And law students have all the arrogance of a lawyer, 1% of the knowledge, but 10x the reckless abandon.  Here's how all that came together:\n\nI moved to DC to do the last semester of my law schooling at Georgetown.  I jumped in an apartment with 2 other people, but never met the landlord.  The people liked me, and said I could move in, but they said the landlord had a review process that could take a few weeks (because he's lazy and/or slow). They also mentioned he was a huge jerk, never fixed anything, hadn't so much as mowed the grass in years, and hadn't paid the light bill in the lobby for months so we had no porch lights.  Whatever, I thought, I needed a place.  I asked them if they cared if I moved in that day, though, and they were fine with it.\n\nI knew enough landlord tenant law in DC to know that the tenant basically always wins, so long as they are paying and not destroying the property.  We used to call it the \"pissing on the walls\" rules.  So I moved in and just skipped the interview.  I sent my first check to the landlord right away (a deposit) followed immediately by a month's rent.  He deposited them as soon as he got them.\n\nA week later or so he raises hell about me moving in without an interview, and threatens to kick me out.  I kindly pointed out that he had accepted my deposit and rent payment, and therefore I was officially a tenant.  If he wanted to kick me out, he would have to start the process in court (which is expensive and takes forever).  He huffed and left me alone.\n\nI quietly paid my rent for months and months.  But, alas, all good things come to an end, and I had to move out eventually.  I emailed the landlord 2 months, then 1 month in advance of leaving.  I let him know that he should come inspect the property to make sure I had not caused any damage that would require my deposit, and that if not, I would like it back.  I never heard from him.\n\nThe time eventually came that I was done living there, and moving out.  I had everything packed and was ready to leave, then notified the landlord that I would like my deposit back.  He said if I wanted it back, I could \"start the process in court.\"\n\nI smiled.  I already knew that was coming.  Turns out, Mr. Landlord, those emails I sent you happen to correspond with the exact days and timing that I am required to give you in order to get my security deposit back.  Oh, by the way, that request to come inspect the premises that you never replied to was also part of the process, and by not coming you have officially waived your inspection as of today (45 days later or something).  Also, I happen to have already filled out the small claim for return of a security deposit.  Here's your copy.  I'm electronically filing this with the court today.\n\nGood luck!\n\n\nAbout 10 days later I got a check in the mail.",

        "text": "The recent landlord story reminded me that I have one of my own to share.\n\nIt's about seven years ago. I'm living in a trailer (like, legit trailer, not a double wide) in a trailer park because it was my own place and it got me the hell away from my parents and didn't cost me an arm and a leg for rent. Cramped? You bet. But living on my own was a freedom I can't understate.\n\nThat price came with its own price, though: The landlord was...kinda lazy. Hell, I didn't even get a tank of propane when I signed the lease, I had to pay for it myself! But rolled into the rent was all utilities besides electricity, which, oddly enough, the landlord was responsible for adding that to our rent every month. (This led to some interesting issues that eventually got resolved but that's not within the scope of this sub.)\n\nOther than that, landlord paid everything.\n\nMy trailer already had issues, mostly parts of it breaking from just old age. But one of the bigger things was the outdoor lighting. You see, there was this very small step that went up to the concrete platform my trailer sat on, and it was small enough that I have no idea why it was put there but big enough that you'll easily trip over it. The landlord had put down those cheapo solar lights to keep it lit, but those had since died.\n\nI brought it to the landlord's attention. Promises it'd get fixed. This went on for weeks.\n\nFinally after a particularly bad day at work, I decided I had enough once I tripped over it for the umpteenth time. Went to the Homeless Despot and picked up some better solar lights and stuck them where the old ones were. Finally, bliss and not having visitors and myself trip up on their way to my front door.\n\n...or so I thought. Couple days later I come home from work, my solar lights are (crudely) ripped out of the ground and tossed aside, and there's a notice taped to my door that essentially said RESIDENTS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO MAKE THEIR OWN REPAIRS OR MODIFICATIONS TO ANYTHING ON THEIR PROPERTY, IF YOU NEED ANYTHING PLEASE CONTACT $LAZYLANDLORD\n\n(For those curious, for the entire year and a half I lived there, no, they never replaced the lights. I did, however, stick a directional light on the one outdoor light I *was* allowed to replace, and aimed it right at the offending step.)\n\nThis becomes relevant later. I just sighed angrily, and went about the rest of my day.\n\nNow, remember when I said things were breaking on my trailer from old age?\n\nA few months later, I come home from work to hear running water near my trailer. I round the corner, and notice that the big water hose feeding my trailer water had basically disintegrated from being old and worn, and was spewing water *everywhere*. I also remembered that 1. The landlord pays the water bill, and 2. They were lazy and never did anything, and 3. When I did try to correct for their laziness they went HAM on me for daring to make my life somewhat better.\n\nSo I turned around, went back to my car, called my mom, and asked if I could stay the night at her house, to which she agreed.\n\nSure, I knew exactly where the shutoff valve was for the water line going to my trailer. Could I have engaged it? Sure. But seeing as the last time I did something good I was screamed at for making \"my own repairs\", nope. Landlord was going to pay for ALL that water. And her laziness too. (Seriously, that hose should have been swapped LONG ago, and wasn't.)\n\nThe landlord did try to hassle me over it (the irony is she lived directly adjacent to my trailer, so her not noticing the GUSHING WATER is next-level laziness), but I pointed out that she specifically told me I'd get a paddlin' if I tried to do anything on my own again, and figured I'd leave water issues to the \"professionals\". And maintenance of the water system was never spelled out in my responsibilities to the property.\n\nShe eventually got relieved of her job a couple months after that whole thing went down. Her replacement was much better about things.",

I informed him that works for me since my closing was postponed by two weeks anyway so, since I apparently had to pay for the full month now anyway I was also going to remain in residence through the end of the month.\n\nBoy was he livid! No, he said, that would be impossible since he already had renters scheduled to move in on the 16th. He informed me he would be changing the locks if I wasn’t out by the 15th.\n\nHuh. Okay, great! That would constitute an illegal eviction, but whatever. I simply stated I would be happy to comply with his request to vacate by the fifteenth and would *not* be paying for any days he was not allowing me to live there and hinted that should he have any further issues with this he should take it up with my lawyer who had already been forwarded the proof of his threat to conduct an illegal, self-help eviction. \n\nHe had nothing else to say and I lived with my parents for two weeks and saved some money. ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)_/¯ ",

        "text": "So, a few days ago I brought something of Taobao (Chinese Amazon) and didn't like it, so I applied for a refund. During the refund, you have to mail it back to the sender then enter the tracking number into the form, so they can verify you actually sent the goods. I used SF this time (顺丰), which unknown to me at the time, gave me two numbers- the label and the tracking number. I mistakenly entered the label number into the form and submitted it.\n\nNow, Taobao doesn't allow you to change the tracking number after you submitted the form, so the sender received the wrong number. After I found out, I texted them the correct number, along with the QR code to track the package. I could see that they saw the number, but didn't reply in any way. Oh well, I thought, they might be having a bad day.\n\nTwo days later, I called SF again and they had delivered the package and that the sender (receiver in this case) had signed for the package. However, they seller had declined the refund, claiming they had not received the package. I challenged their decision, sent the information, which they declined again, stating a wrong tracking number (even though I had texted them the correct number again). I challenged their decision, they declined, (repeat 8x). I finally gave up, and entered arbitration with Taobao, the seller, and myself. The representative sided with me, and demanded the seller return the money since I had obviously provided sufficient evidence I returned it.\n\nThe next day, I texted the seller for a refund, but despite the ruling, he thought I still hadn't returned the goods. I showed him screenshots of the ruling, the tracking number, and every shred of evidence I had INCLUDING HIS OWN SIGNATURE AND ADDRESS. As expected, he continually denied it, becoming more and more sarcastic. (I translated his message below)\n\n\"Haha, you daft idiot, do you think I'm an idiot? Go ask Taobao for the money, maybe they'll tell you where your refund went. Report me if I care\"\n\nSo, I did what he asked. \n\nI escalated the matter to a human supervisor (before, Taobao used AI for arbitration and support). Their representative was very polite and helpful, and asked for the evidence, including the ruling, which I sent over. Five minutes later, they called me, told me I was fully refunded from their insurance (15USD / 100RMB) and that they would be opening a fraud investigation against the seller since he obviously went against the arbitration and tried to scam me. I also later heard that because of his attitude and his attempted fraud, he was fined 50 000 RMB (About 8000USD) by Taobao and the information passed onto the police.\n\nTL:DR scammer tried to scam me, even after arbitration, refuses to return money, tells me to report him, he loses 5K and gets investigated for fraud.",

We had a new squadron member inbound on a commercial jet so I was assigned to meet him and take him off the plane before the rest of the passengers deplaned.  (We did this for all our squadron members PCSing in to our base.)\n\nI get to the plane and get the VIP's off first then call for 2nd lieutenant \"Smith\" to please come to the front of the aircraft.  I introduced myself, grabbed his carry-on and led him to my truck to take him to the squadron office to get him inprocessed.  Lt. Smith was a wet-behind-the-ears, fresh out of the academy smug punk.  Lt. Smith did not thank me or ask me any questions about the country, base or squadron, he proceeded to bitch that a Sergeant was the facilitator for an officer.  I just kept my mouth shut and dropped him and his carry-on at the squadron office.  \n\nLt. Smith was assigned as the OIC (officer in charge) of my area.  He had a meeting with all the NCO's (which I was one) and told us that no decisions would be made or work done without going through him and getting his input/approval.  \n\nNow, anyone who's been in the military knows that this would be impossible.  We weren't fighting a war, we were loading cargo and passengers into/out of aircraft, refueling and cleaning such and coordinating with the tower and air crew.  No one had time for this kid's bullshit, but so be it.\n\nThe NCO's (including me) proceeded to ask Lt. Smith for permission to do every nit-pickin' thing before we did it.  We had two departures run late (huge no-no), passengers that didn't get on their flights, essential cargo that didn't leave on the first outbound to it's destination, you get the picture.  \n\nIt only took about 6 hours for the squadron commander to come down on Lt. Smith like Zeus from Olympus.  Commander stormed into Lt. Smith's office and yelled at him for about 10 minutes.  Now, my daddy is a Marine and I had my share of ass chewings but my ears are still ringing from that dressing-down.  \n\nLt. Smith learned a valuable lesson that day-do not fuck with the people doing the job or they will fuck with you.  He actually ended-up being a decent officer, one who let his people do the job and stayed the Hell out of our way.",

        "text": "I used to work grocery way back. I worked at a store in the chain where managers were sent for training so we never really had a permanent store manager, which sucked because every single manager we got wanted to leave their mark on the place, and my department manager was a giant suckup so he'd take it all hook, line, and sinker.\n\nOur store was chosen as the training store because we were a relatively small store with not a lot of customers passing through, in fact, most of our customers were return customers, not unique customers, and this becomes relevant in a bit. We all knew eachother and were generally a pretty friendly place because everyone knew everyone. \n\nAs is usual, we got a new manager, and they thought they could prove themselves by increasing our sales and thus our profit for the company. So he enacted a policy called sales synergy base touching (okay, not really, but it was some buzzword-laced bullshit I can't remember) which involved us acting like a cell phone sales rep. We'd try to get people to buy more. Oh, you buying so and so at the deli? Why not add a little bit more or get this to compliment it? \n\nAnd we were ordered to always shill for our private brand stuff rather than the name brand. Up until now when customers asked for recommendations on stuff we always spoke from our own experiences, but now we were being told to always say our in-house brand was the best.\n\nNaturally, our customers were none too pleased about this, and after enough of them complained, one of the external department managers came up with a strategy.\n\nYou see, at the time at least, on every point of sale system we had these postcards that would solicit you for your feedback on how we did with that transaction. No one paid these any mind at all until now. You'd take one, fill it out, and leave it with an employee or drop it in the mail. The deli department manager noted that these cards go to the district manager, above the current store manager.\n\nNow, we were always encouraged to solicit feedback from customers, but we decided to take it a step farther and actively point out the existence of these feedback cards in an effort to get customers to fill them out. If the DM heard enough blowback from this, he might tell the store manager to knock it off.\n\nEvery time we'd have to roll our eyes and give the spiel, we'd pull out a card, hand it to them, wink and tell them if they're not happy to please let us know where we went wrong. Everyone began carrying a stack of them on their person. Store manager found out and told us to stop, but 1. We were totally allowed to ask customers for their feedback as it's in the handbook, and 2. it was too late, DM was already getting ready to tear into him.\n\nAfter that we got a store-wide memo posted next to the time clock that we were to abandon the sales tactics effective immediately.\n\nVictory.",

        "text": "[From](https://twitter.com/cmclymer/status/985760075695476737) Twitter user [@cmclymer](https://twitter.com/cmclymer):\n\n&gt; Today, I was sitting in front of a cafe in downtown D.C., minding my own goddamn business, when three people who were clearly tourists of some sort walked up and gestured for me to take out my headphones. And I did and one of them said: \"Can we pray for you?\"\n&gt; \n&gt; I asked them why they wanted to pray for me, and the same person answered that they felt called by God to walk around the streets of D.C. and let God's voice tell them who might be broken or otherwise need prayer. She literally used the word \"broken\".\n&gt; \n&gt; Now... I'm a Christian, and I'm not opposed to prayer or people praying specifically for me when done in good faith. But I was dressed femme as hell today with gorgeous makeup and earrings, and I sure as hell caught the gist of why these folks happened upon me to offer prayer.\n&gt; \n&gt; And I thought: let's do this. And I so asked their spokesperson if she understood how it might look to be searching for \"broken\" people to pray for and specifically pick out a random transgender person on the street to offer prayer. And they looked more than taken aback.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, I stood up, with what passed for a smile barely concealing my annoyance with this situation, and I asked them what the Book of Matthew says about prayer. And their eyes go wide and the guy on the right starts nervously stammering in front of me in front of this cafe.\n&gt; \n&gt; It's clear he's having trouble answering the question, as are the other two, so ambushed are they that the \"broken\" transgender person is asking a simple question about a common verse on prayer in Matthew, and I wait for a few seconds more than what is comfortable to answer.\n&gt; \n&gt; \"You know how Matthew says that where two or three are gathered in Jesus' name, there He is with us.\" And they stare blankly at me because they have tiptoed with their condescending, passive-aggressive bullshit straight into a brick wall, and I have no intention of going easy.\n&gt; \n&gt; \"That is what Matthew says, is it not?\" And one of them says \"yes, that's right\", and they don't understand that the verse is commonly misused as a prayer for intercession rather than its true purpose as a prayer of accountability. And here, today, I shall bring accountability.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have had it up to here with Evangelicals sticking their noses into how my humanity is defined, and I will be damned if they're going to interrupt my Sunday afternoon coffee when I certainly wasn't bothering them.\n&gt; \n&gt; \"So, let's pray.\" And they nervously step forward into a circle.\n&gt; \n&gt; I say to one of them: \"You start us off.\" And she does. It is quick and antiseptic because they, the three of them, want to get the hell away from this awkward situation. And then I pick it up when it's clear she's done.\n&gt; \n&gt; \"Lord Jesus, thank you for the benefit of these friends...\" and I'm quite honest with God about how I hope She'll bless my new friends w/ a priority for affirmation and inclusion of others. That their community will honor all as God made them and value the strength of diversity.\n&gt; \n&gt; And I specifically mention the natural beauty of the LGBTQ community and thank God again for making us as we exist, and I throw in there a genuine wish that their trip back home is a safe one and wrap the prayer up in the usual Evangelical banal phraseology to let them know that I know their community's vernacular better than they do, and by the time I am finished, by the time I have translated the score back to them by tenfold relative to their passive-aggressive \"let us pray for you\", they murmur their thank yous and scuttle thou hell away.\n&gt; \n&gt; And now, hopefully, they will know how it feels to have someone inject an overwrought and venomous self-righteousness into the core of their being and - I hope - realize how much actions like these diminish the power of prayer and enable so much harm to LGBTQ people.\n&gt; \n&gt; Evangelicals: you are not doing the Lord's work by dumping your misplaced condescension on random strangers you believe to be, uh, \"broken\".\n&gt; \n&gt; These people did not want to know more about me. They wanted to talk at me and pray at me. And I'm fairly sure Jesus would not do that.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, remember: if you ever feel the need to do this... don't. Because it may backfire spectacularly, and you'll wind up praying for a restored sense of peace after your varnish gets unceremoniously stripped away.\n&gt; \n&gt; Prayer should be a loving act, not a bizarre political weapon.",

The dish washer was paid something like $15/hour. There was a change in management and no one likes the new general manager.

The manager kept scheduling him on those days, that combined with being a shitty manager in general, he quit.

It's a relatively busy night in the actual restaurant but very few deliveries. He's been doing dishes, prepping toppings, things around the kitchen to help. The GM sees him eat a couple pepperonis and throws a stink about it. So my cousin says something along the lines of \"fine, then I'm not doing any more work without proper compensation, you can do the dishes\".\n\nThe manager spent the rest of the night doing tons of dishes while he sat around and made a few deliveries, all over $0.05 worth of pizza toppings. \n\nNot the most exciting MC, but it was satisfying to hear.",

        "text": "So, about 5 years ago I started my PhD in physics at a university. Now, at this particular university and specifically the department of physics, as a PhD student I was required to undertake a certain amount of topics - something that is not required of PhD students in our country literally anywhere else. The topic choices were left up to us, with the one proviso that they were to 'expand our horizons'. So I look through the physics topics on offer and none of them fit my project in the slightest, so instead I thought to myself: it would be nice to learn some genetics and some other branches of research to maybe expose me to alternative research strategies that I can apply to my project, etc.\n\nSo fast forward to my first 6 month probationary meeting and the question comes up: what subjects are you going to take? I immediately say that I was planning to do genetics, and explained my reasoning for it. Well, wouldn't you know it, the academics in the meeting went off at me, telling me that that was completely unacceptable and I had to do a physics topic or something directly related to my project. \n\nAt the same time, a relatively new Occupational Health and Safety officer had decided to flex his bureaucratic muscles and crack down on our lab in particular for cutting glass tubing without the correct training on the diamond saw. We only did this once every 6 or so months, due to the plasma environment destroying the tubes. But this little annoyance/drama gave me an idea: time to kill two birds with one stone. So, I went to my supervisor and laid down my plan, and with a massive grin he signed off on it.\n\nSo the next probationary meeting comes around and when again the topic of my subjects came up, I looked them dead in the eye and said that I would be taking glass-blowing (an arts subject), and I calmly explained to them, while their obvious agitation increased, how it was absolutely necessary for me to do so in order to have the proper training to cut the glass tubing. And that is how I ended up doing four years of glass blowing topics during my physics PhD.",

        "text": "This was about 10 years ago and some days I'm still a bit salty over it. \n\n\n\nThe school I went to is small and in the middle of nowhere (250 kids in the school, 73 in my graduating class). So favoritism laws weren't really enforced. By my senior year I had so many extra credits that I only needed two more classes to graduate, but to still be considered at least part time and in compliance with some law i was forced to take 4. I had two random classes, math, and honors English, out of 6 periods I was able to set it up in such a way that I went in for 2nd-5th period so I would show up late and leave right after lunch. The problems I had were with my English teacher (E for short), for an \"advanced\" class I was honestly pretty damn bored. \n\n\nOur reading included; *To Kill A Mockingbird* and *Animal Farm*, there were kids in my class who couldn't even read at that level so even though I'd read the books before we were often forced to read out loud together in class because people weren't doing their reading (it honestly felt like elementary school). So while that was going on I usually had my book of the day propped open within the book we were supposed to be reading. She sat us by last name so I was in the back and it wasn't noticeable, whenever she called on me she would get angry because I did have answers above and beyond what she was looking for. I never hid my boredom, but neither was I disruptive, I just did my own thing. Throughout the year her nieces were in the class and of course her top students, they got away with being disruptive, not turning in homework etc. I would get marked down on ridiculous things such as using a colon rather than a semi colon. Even with her going after me for stupid crap I had an A with 99% in the class.\n\n\n\nAt the end of the year we had our final exam, a bunch of multiple choice questions and between 5 different writing prompts, we were required to write 2 short essays of 2-3 paragraphs each. I made it through 1 and a half essays and all of the questions, (I actually wrote 4 paragraphs for the first essay) within the allotted 40 minutes. She never mentioned it even though I specifically stated I needed to finish one during the rest of week and she said it was fine.\n\n\n\nThe next week I was taken to NYC for the week for my \"graduation\" (my mom added me as an afterthought). I got a call from E and my principal half way through the trip saying that, even though I got 95% of the multiple choice correct and wrote an excellent/thoughtful essay, I was going to be flunked, not graduate and not be allowed to walk (again just for missing 1 paragraph). I was furious and asked if I could finish my essay like I'd requested to do the week before. (E said it had slipped her mind and I'm lucky/thankful my principal had known me since I was 9yrs old in 5th grade) they both agreed on the stipulation that I wrote two new essays. I said fine. \n\n\n\nMonday I showed up for her first period English class and was given 5 different writing prompts from the originals. I sat there for the entire fourty minute period writing an answer to each and every single question, making sure that they were 3 paragraphs minimum. I made sure to request a copy to submit to the principal so she couldn't try to screw me again. The look of anger on her face when I turned in 3 pages of writing was priceless. I graduated with my 3.9 GPA and have thankfully never had to deal with that sort of shit again.\n\n**TL;DR** English teacher hates that I dont pay absolute attention to her and tries to completely flunk me out of high school to repeat my senior year.",

        "text": "I was working at a family owned lumberyard about ten years ago.  For background, most of the prices for in-store items were set by our supplier, and were a bit higher than local competitors, so if a sale was over $10, we'd give them a 10% discount.  The discount was entered in manually, and we'd be pretty lenient with our regular, enjoyable customers.  The $10 mark was merely a rough number. \n\nOne of our regular, pain-in-the-ass customers came in.  He comes up the the counter with a couple of small items.  Total came to $5 something.  I give him his total, he pays, and then looks over his receipt.  Then he looks at me and says \"I get a ten percent discount\".   I explain that the computer only allows it if the total is over ten dollars.  (Total lie, but this guy is a known asshole, so even at 9.99, he can f-off). He says, \"Oh ok, then I'm going to keep shopping\".  \n\nI punch up a return for his already paid for items, give him his money back, and he keeps shopping.  Comes back a few minutes later with a couple more items.  I punch him up again.  Now it comes out to $11 something.  He gets his discount.  He pays and checks his receipt.  Then he says \"this item was a different price in the hook\".  So I go check.  Sure enough, one of his items is ten cents cheaper on the hook then what is scanned.  The second item he purchased was hung right nearby, and I noticed that one was 30 cents more than what it scanned.  I chose not to say anything right there.\n\nReturned those items, and then rescanned them and edited the prices to match the hook prices.  He's grinning ear to ear while I'm doing this.  Then I look at him and tell him he owes me another 22 cents or so.  He asks how and I tell him that when I updated the prices, one item was cheaper and the other was more expensive.  He says \"oh, ok\".  Smiles, pays, doesn't check his receipt, and walks out the door.\n\nThe guy spent an extra $5 to save $1.",

        "text": "This happened ages ago, but here goes: \n\nI had the misfortune of going to HS during an era when every school in the country was ordered to take part in an national effort to get kids exercising. I was a very skinny girl (oh, for those days), and I didn't care for PE to begin with, so I hated the song on the 45-rpm record (look it up if you need to) they issued for use during exercises - it was fondly known as the \"Chicken Fat\" song. During one miserable class, we were on the hard gym floor doing the blasted exercises (to the really stupid song), and it came to the verse about pushups. We did \"girl\" pushups back then, which is where you push up from your knees, not your feet, and my knees were in agony from the hard floor.\n\nSo I quit doing any of it &amp; went on strike. I just lay on the floor while the dumbass song played. And then the nasty PE teacher came by and demanded to know why I wasn't doing pushups and bouncing around to that idiot tune.\n\n*\"Because I don't have any chicken fat!\"* (I was still on the floor, glaring up at her). \n\nShe tried to argue with me, but I refused &amp; pointed to my bruised knees, and then she ordered me into the locker room. As luck would have it, the vice-principal (a real B****) came into the locker room during all of this. The instructor proudly pointed to her errant student and told the VP about my insurrection, at which time the VP smiled big and turned to me &amp; issued my punishment:\n\n\"Write an essay about Physical Education, and turn it in before the end of the week.\" Her eyes even narrowed when she gave the orders, and her smile widened.\n\nI smiled back, even bigger than she smiled, and agreed. I then wrote a detailed essay about what a waste of time PE classes were, especially if you factor in the time it took to change at the start of class, the limited amount of actual exercise time per-person in team sports (I calculated it - it wasn't much - less than two minutes as I recall), and the time to change out of gym clothes, shower, and get back into your regular clothes. I concluded with a reiteration that it was wasted time.\n\nI really wish I'd seen the reaction to the essay, but I never heard another word about it. \n\nOh - by the way, yes, I went on to become a journalist after HS. I have always loved writing and I still write for various publications. And I still hate doing pushups.\n \n\n  ",

        "text": "This happened a few years ago when I worked at a very busy Taco John's. There was this man that would come in 2- 3 times a week for an apple grande (basically a tostada with Apple pie filling on it and 1/2 cup of shredded cheese). He was always in a sour mood and treated everyone like shit. We were his peasants that he came to pick on regularly during our busiest hours and due to our boss also being a douche no one had the stones to stand up to this man out of fear of getting fired. Instead as soon as \"cheese man\" would walk in, bickering amongst us workers in the back would break out as to who would take his order and deal with the what ALWAYS happened after....of course me being the passive shy girl drew the short straw every time. So this man would get an apple Grande with extra cheese every time. That's all he ever ordered, and despite us putting extra cheese on he always would bring it back and scream in my face about how there was not enough cheese and to take it back and put more on.... so I would do so and sometimes even then, it wasn't enough for the \"cheese man\". I even tried to explain to him as sweetly as possible that we had rules put in place by our boss about how much extra we were allotted each time extra was asked and apologized. This would just make him more angry and make him spew more word barf of how I was just a low life incompetent worker. So on one particular taco Tuesday during lunch rush \"cheese man\" reared his ugly head. My first thought was NOT TODAY SATAN and I actually volunteered to be the sacrifice....little did he know I had had enough....the quiet shy girl snapped.....well....on the inside. I smiled ear to ear politely took and gave him his order and as expected he returned it because you know....not enough cheese. Me still chipper as can be \" I am so sorry sir I will take care of this for you\". I go to the back with his already extra cheesed Grande and took 3 massive handfuls of cheese and packed it on top to the point I couldn't close the box..but I made that bitch close... because \"not today satan\". After I successfully made it look like a semi normal box again I delivered him back his big block of cheese with a side of apple and a smile on my face. \"Sorry for the wait sir you have an absolutely fantastic day\", handed over his package and walked away.... If I had a Mic I so would have dropped it. I felt so good. AND \"cheese man\" never came back. I'd say mission accomplished, don't bite the hands that feed you. ",

        "text": "So this happened a couple of years ago when I was working as a waiter at a fine dining restaurant. The owner wanted it to be super posh so we had to do things like wear white gloves when placing our cutlery so as not to get fingerprints on them. \n\nThis owner was a particularly rude old man (ROM) who tried to cost save when ever he could. \n\nQueue Valentine’s Day. \n\nThe ROM has added tables in every corner of his restaurant so people who had purchased the couples dinner special were basically sitting in each others laps and, as you can expect, we received many complaints about this.. Because of the amount of customers we had that night ROM had hired runners for each waiter who would clear the plates for us. I had the largest room as I was the most experienced waiter that night. \n\nNow this ROM managed to get two of these runners crying before even half the night was done because they were to slow, didn’t stack enough plates each run etc. etc and these girls were having a really rough night. At one pint in the night my room became really quiet (everyone had food and I’d just topped up wines&amp;waters) so I picked some plates up to help the girls out.  As I walk in to the kitchen ROM is standing there and sees me coming in with the plates. \n\nROM: Thornadobanan what are you doing?? Don’t pick up plates. That’s not yo job!! Go sell more wine to customers!!! \n\nThornadobanan: Sorry ROM. As you say boss. \n\nAs things are slowing down a bit ROM decides to send the runners home so he doesn’t have to pay them more. About 10 minutes later I’m standing in the hallway with ROM while he is counting money. He can see in to my room and the table closest to us has finished eating....\n\nROM: Thornadobanan go clear plates. Don’t stand here. \n\nThornadobanan: Sorry ROM I can’t do that. \n\nROM: what is wrong with you?!? I am boss!! Go clear the table!!! \n\nThornadobanan: sorry mate you told me not to. \n\nYou guys probably can guess what happened next. \n\nROM EXPLODES. I have never seen this man go off on someone this much before. His head was turning in to the color of a fire truck and I thought he would have a heart attack. Now the thing was I also had a full time job and I was just doing this for extra money and I enjoyed chatting to the customers/other staff. \n\nI proceed to ask for my pay for the night. Hand him my apron and wine opener (which he forced us to provide a deposit for) and quit on the spot, leaving my room of 30+ customers with no waiter or runner on one of the busiest nights of the year.\n\n\n\n\nROM had to begrudgingly go clear the plates himself. \n\n\n\n\n",
