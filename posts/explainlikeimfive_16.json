I get that characters need something to do but they seem so much more...  I guess contrived than other tropes of the genre? Who came up with the idea of dungeons as we know them today? What were they based off of? It just seems like such a huge leap from literal real world dungeons to the basically sprawling underground puzzle caves that exist in fiction that seem to exist solely for people to solve them and get rewards from. Like if they're made to protect things why have puzzles with solutions in the first place? Why make it doable at all?",
