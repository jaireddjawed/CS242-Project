        "text": "• Meghan tiptoes', cowering into rooms, because she's afraid of being labeled pushy, difficult or an angry black woman.\n\n[Legal Disclaimer ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Meghans_Truth/comments/zgejdx/legal_disclaimer/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n  Part 1 is here \n\n     Meghan: Yeah. Because I often find myself even in walking into a room, I'm particular.  I think a high tide raises all ships, right? We're all going to succeed. So let's make sure it's really great because it's a shared success for everybody. But I also know that I will find myself cowering and tiptoeing into a room where, I don’t know if you do the thing that I find the most embarrassing, when you're saying a sentence, but the intonation goes up like it's a question.\nMeghan: And I was just like, Oh, my God, stop, stop, whispering and tiptoeing around it.\nJust say what it is that you need. You're allowed to set a boundary. You're allowed to be clear. It does not make you demanding. It does not make you difficult. Makes you clear.\n\nhttps://newsroom.spotify.com/media-kit/archetypes-podcast-transcripts/\n\n  So Meghan has had a reputation of being difficult from the beginning. In fact before she ever met Harry things were already being said. But is Meghan really cowering when she enters rooms? Does she really fear being labeled pushy, demanding, difficult, an angry black woman? Only one way to find out and video is the best way to do that. As the one above proves.\n\nIs Meghan's clear, or is she demanding?  As of May 2022 over 14 top aids have quit the Sussex's since there 2018 wedding.\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11507175/Harry-Meghans-revolving-door-staff-14-employees-Sussexes-lost-2018.html\n\nHigh stress job, new person in the mix, a little friction and even turnover is normal. But no other royal seems to have such a high volume of turnover in employees. And usually when one does it's linked to a major life event, a wedding, birth etc. So it is at the least noteworthy.\n\nAccusations of bullying started even before the Australia Tour, but really seemed to escalate after that. Now strangely Harry and Meghan have sued 10 different times since 2019, most of which center on the media. \n\nhttps://www.newsweek.com/prince-harry-meghan-markle-ten-lawsuits-3-years-what-they-say-couple-mail-sunday-police-1724175\n\nThey have 0 problems going to court. Yet  4 large detractors have gone unanswered, three perfect for the same kind of libel suit Samantha Markle has against Meghan. The bullying article. Tom Bower's book Revenge, Valentine Lowe's Book Courtiers, and the Palace bullying investigation which did not publish it's results. All have done massive amounts of damage to The Sussex's, Meghan in particular. Tom Bower has been taken to court, and won against several power players including Richard Desmond, Conrad Black, and Richard Branson. Which is the only reason I give his book weight. One half-lie is grounds for a libel case, and having to pay damages. As far as I can tell he hasn't paid a cent.\n\nWhy not go to court, and tell 'there truth' as they claimed. Why not petition the Palace for the results of the investigation, or release them yourself as Meghan did request a copy of the findings. This is one of there biggest PR problems, and easily solved. Yet...nada, nothing, silence. Like everything else about this couple, it's bizarre.\n\n\nThe clip from 'According 2taz' made me realize why Meghan's behavior during the funeral week was so strange, and noticable. There Meghan was unsure. There Meghan was tip toeing. And it was a huge contrast to what we usually see from her. As was Harry's, he was more assertive, he was taking the lead. He smiled. It was a complete role reversal.\n\n     https://pagesix.com/2022/09/13/meghan-markle-showed-inner-anxiety-at-queen-memorial-expert/amp/\n\n     \n  Each link below is a different clip of Meghan at multiple events from 2016 to 2022.\nThis isn't every clip, but it's enough. The video above gives pretty good evidence on it's own. \n\n(And this has come up a lot so I'll explain, the Morocco bit was a big deal because Harry is the Prince, and the man. Meghan wasn't even allowed to walk down the red carpet with him she had to walk beside it. It is a heavily Muslim country, and while not super strict and known for being tolerant they do have customs (and Muslim rules) and foreign dignitaries are meant to follow them.)\n\nhttps://www.roughguides.com/morocco/culture-etiquette/\n\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/L53FsIyKSQg\n    (Link to video from the clip)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/LNf-sPIz3IU\n         (Clip at 1:17:00 of Meghan and Palace Aid)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/aNqAri5omds\n          (Great Body Language clip\n\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/p-JO8X6kefo?feature=share\n       (Clip of Meghan with Royal aid.)\n\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/dUEz0P4IUmI?feature=share\n      (Meghan and Doria )\n\nhttps://youtu.be/WXXPYMnQsqY\n      (Meghan's elbow)\n\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/OMzIvghWxkU?feature=share\n   (Red carpet in Germany)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/7rJzvyToxDY\n     (Wedding and Charlotte)\n\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/7ZcI1uMbgzE?feature=share\n    (Harry's UN speech)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ki9tuuPK7Es\n    (The yellow dress)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/iihmLhGZAv0\n   (Harry's Friends)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/cYLK_rMeimY\n    (Gestures)\n\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/J3uPlAxLlzk?feature=share\n  (The chair)",
