        "text": "I was studying Tolkien's Finn and Hengest and was intrigued by his reconstructing the past of the Frisians, Jutes and Danes in the fifth and sixth centuries. So I'm looking for some reading suggestions on the history of Germanic peoples. \n\nI'm especially interested in the early history, from when they diverged from Indo-European until Christianity, but also open to stuff from after since there's probably more sources on that.\nI've found some books on Indo-Europeans in general or histories of other peoples such as Celts and Slavs, but not much on Germanic peoples specifically. If anything, they feature around the North Germanic peoples. But I'm interested in how the different Germanic \"tribes\" such as Danes, Goths, Frisians and Franks differed from eachother, evolved separately and borrowed from others, and the common grounds. Migrations, language, religion, genetics, anything goes really.\n\nThanks!",

I was saying that it is not necessarily essential to the perpetuation of the species like sex is.  Many animal species don't kiss one another yet they still propagate.  Perhaps \"no biological purpose\" was the incorrect phrasing to convey my point.  I was just wondering since it's primarily a human trait that most other species of animals don't do, is it a built in biological drive for humans to kiss, or a cultural phenomenon?  And if it's the latter, does anyone know what culture(s) popularized it.  I'm sorry if my wording caused any confusion. ",

I took a great deal of anthropology classes in college, but outside of Introduction to Linguistics I don't think my professors described China *at all*. While I have a fair amount of friends who are Chinese and know some Chinese nationals really well, my understanding of the Chinese cultural landscape is appallingly incomplete.\n\nWhat are the foundational works of modern Chinese ethnography? While I'm sure most interesting research happens in the minute analysis of specific Chinese societies, I really want an all-encompassing text that can help me understand China. While I would really like something new, because Chinese society has changed incredibly rapidly in the past 50 years and because I'd like to avoid any traces of Orientalism, any book recommendations are appreciated.

        "text": "I have two questions for this subreddit:\n\n1 Why is there an extremely large cultural taboo in Japan about your picture being taken? I've been watching a bunch of awesome Japanese multicultural youtube channels covering the international incident Jake Paul created in Aokigahara and one of them mentioned how in an arcade they couldn't even take a picture of themselves at the arcade as that was the place's policy. Further more their friend took a picture of some guy cheating on his wife and got sued in a messy legal battle and lost. The youtuber also mentioned that taking pictures of people is against a lot of societal norms in Japan, not to mention the laws that are in place against your picture being taken without your permission. So I was wondering why are there these strong social and cultural norms that are strong enough that when this youtuber posts pictures of him with his Japanese friends he has to put a black bar over their eyes?\n\n\nThe youtuber I follow is called Gaijin Goomba and does cultural analysis videos of different items in videogames and their real world and historical origins. I thought I'd mention it as it's basically anthropology of cultural items and influences in videogames.\n\n\n\nThe second question I have is is there a cheap, under $20 college level anthropology text book that's recommended by people here? I am starting to realize that I love to learn about the origins of why certain social and cultural constructions and norms exist and while I would never go to the jungles where it seems like a lot of anthropologists find themselves in their research (please correct me if this is wrong as the few chapters I've read mentioning anthropology in my college courses always have someone ending up in a jungle with tribes people searching for either the origins or early comparisons to societal structures.), I love to read about what the origins of these things are as I find them absolutely interesting.\n\n\nAlso note I can't take an introduction to Anthropology course next semester otherwise I would be reading that text book already instead of asking online.",

        "text": "Hello /r/AskAnthropology! First of all, I'm sorry if the following post is going to be a bit wall of text-ish... I have a number of questions in my mind.\n\nCurrently I'm planning my thesis in anthro. My plan is to study micro-celebrities/influencers. \n\nThis might come off as weird but in my department no professor specializes in digital/virtual ethnography, including my adviser. In where I live this field seems to be a bit under-studied;  I tried to look up some info but most studies seem to be coming from communication and political science which involve little to no ethnography.\n\nSo I did some digging myself. I've read a few books/articles that I think might be related (Postill's, Boelstroff's, Hine's, and Markham's), but I'm still scratching my head about how to do this ethnographically. I have done a fieldwork before but it was only for a class; my undergrad was in political science (my few research experiences mostly is on the quantitative side and some interviews) and the fieldwork I did for a class was something more \"traditional\".\n\nI was told by my adviser that in order to study influencers I need to live in like anthropologists usually do. Participating in Twitter and blogs (where they spend most of their time in the internet) wouldn't be enough, I need to engage in how they live their life. I did some preliminary - attended influencers gathering, did some interviewing, socialized in the social media - and there are a couple of problems lingering in my head...\n\n* Influencer works very individually. Tweeting and/or writing a blog post is something they do while they're commuting to their work, having a break in the work place, enjoying a time at home, or hanging out with friends. It's something they do in their spare time. How can I get into their life like that - live in their home? Especially considering \"intruding\" into private lives of urban folks seem to be a bit more difficult than in rural areas...\n* Since I need to build a rapport with a couple of influencers - with different primary jobs, different places of living (still in the same city, but can be located 20 kms away) - what would be the most effective way to engage in their life? Building rapport with one person so that I could get a glimpse of their daily life would already take a lot of time I imagine, what about a several?\n* They are very mobile. They can commute long distance. As my subjects are travel and lifestyle influencers that means they occasionally travels to other parts in the country too - which would cost plane tickets. Do I need to follow them that far?\n* This might sound like a really dumb, clueless question, but is doing this traditionally the only way to do it ethnographically? My professor insists that it's the only way but I'm curious if there's an alternative.\n\nI have about a year for my study. I'm not in a hurry (I can extend the studying period if needed); but I'm a bit too clueless. My thesis adviser asked me to focus on the relation between man and technology in digital age which I guess why he emphasized the importance of doing this \"traditionally\"...\n\nWhat do anthropologists in this sub think about it? I'm open to any advice. I'd love to know if there's a good books/articles that can help me too.\n\nSorry if this sounds so amateurish. I'd really appreciate the help!\n\n",

Specifically I like to worldbuild for my fiction, and I like to draw on scholarly thought on topics such as this to add a decent layer of realism. Fantasy fiction in general tends to take a *lot* of liberties about human culture (even in the absence of magical influences), usually promoting the whimsical over the pragmatic. It's a trope I like to intentionally subvert when possible. \n\nI understand this topic will largely be theoretical, but I have come across a couple of articles that both cite Textor's \"A Cross-Cultural Summary.\" I gleaned a good amount of information from these to help get the cogs turning in my head... but I was wondering if there is any other comprehensive texts (particularly more contemporary ones)? Has the field moved away from this area of research/theory? Has another field adopted it?\n\nFor example (just of the random conjectures that come to mind; no evidence): has anyone explored a potential connection between the cyclical monsoon season being related to Hinduism's \"samsara\" (cyclical change) philosophy? I mention it specifically because of the almost magic-like change the environment goes through once the rains begin. (http://i.imgur.com/tOip6dx.jpg) The rains also could hypothetically be linked to the religious significance of water in Hinduism (e.g., almost all temples have a sizable water tank for purification purposes; holy places are usually adjacent to water; funeral grounds are typically near a river; etc.).\n\nAgain, that was just conjecture on my part. I was just trying to give an example of the line of thought I was going after and if anyone here could point me in the right direction for some good resources. I was looking for more than just information on the relation between environment and Hinduism, it just happened to be one that sparked my imagination a bit.\n\nThanks, and you all have a lovely community here!

        "text": "So I have just finished reading a book (L'origine des systèmes familiaux, Tome 1 : L'Eurasie, by Emmanuel Todd) on traditional family systems. His thesis says that traditional family systems influence some of the values of today's societies.\n\nAnd in one of the author's interviews, he says that lowering the status of women sterilizes the creativity of societies.\n\n&gt; **Europe, placed on the periphery, therefore has a \"nuclear\" family structure that is archaic?**  \nExactly. What emerges as a global vision of humanity is that primitive, hunter-gatherer societies initially have a nuclear family system: a father, a mother and children. The family is not alone, it is associated by horizontal kinship ties (type brother/sister, brother-in-law/sister-in-law) with other nuclear families, in the form of \"local bands\". These fluid groups use the links between men and women to form each other. It is in this context that human history begins. All sorts of inventions and innovations are appearing: agriculture, writing, the city, the state, in short, civilization. And innovations, also in the family domain, towards more complex and heavier shapes. And fundamental innovation is changing the relative positions of men and women. In Sumer, in the middle of the third millennium B. C., or in China at the end of the second millennium, a patrilineal system can be observed. First, with the appearance of the male primogenitating family (the eldest of the boys inherits most of the family's property, but girls are still allowed to succeed if there is no boy), then with the fully patrilineal community family (there, there is no question of the girls succeeding) and, from there, once the patrilineal architecture has been built.  \n**It is paradoxical, because this regression occurs in societies that invented everything...**  \nYes! In extremely progressive societies, at a time when there is nothing in Europe! This lowering of the status of women sterilizes the creativity of these societies, since it must be admitted, without exaggerated feminism, that the educational potential of children decreases when mothers are infantilized. But even men, theoretically dominant, are partly children in a patrilineal antiindividualistic system. The patrilineal principle, then its accentuation, paralyzes these societies little by little. And that is why history shows us the end of the Middle East civilization, Chinese civilization, Indian civilization.  \n**And what happens to the West?**  \nWell, the West, which has invented neither agriculture, nor the city, nor writing, nor the State, will receive all these innovations by diffusion. While escaping the patrilineal system and thus keeping its primitive dynamism, which is in fact the dynamism of cavemen. People like Max Weber, for example, were trying to explain the mystery of the take-off from the West, but there is no mystery of the West! The real mystery is that of these central societies, which invented everything and paralyzed themselves by adopting a patrilineal system. In the case of the Middle East, to which Europe owes everything, it goes even further, because there is the additional paralysing innovation of endogamy, of uniting with people from the same family. So not only is the group centred on men, but it closes in on itself through marriage between cousins.\n\nSo why lowering the status of women sterilizes the creativity of societies?\n\nEdit : [The interview in French](http://www.lepoint.fr/grands-entretiens/emmanuel-todd-l-occident-n-est-pas-foutu-01-09-2011-1374220_326.php)",

The man deserves the kids, by default. Even if he is abusive. Because he was probably only abusive because of the wife in the first place.\nMarriages would be a lot healthier if it was a system where the man could walk away with no consequences. The purpose of a woman in the universe is to provide services to a man, and she would be providing much better services if she knew the man could take everything she has away from her an moment. That is the way human relationships have always worked. The man was always able to walk away, and this kept the woman obedient and pleasing.\n\nIs this really supported by history or is he making things up?",
