        "text": "Hello Again! \n\nThis is my second question today on an altogether different topic.\n\nI recently finished the audiobook version of *The Afghanistan Papers: A Secret History of the War* by Craig Whitlock and came across something that blew my mind.\n\nIn the book, one of the difficulties American military forces reported in trying to train Afghan soldiers is that *they couldn't count*. The idea of numbers, even basic ones, were (allegedly) beyond their basic comprehension. When asked how many brothers someone had, the Afghan solider could not give an answer in the form of a number, but would instead list the names of their brothers. \n\nI would give an exact quote, but I'm afraid I listened to this on audiobook. I found the following quote via Goodreads that came from the same chapter: “Almost all Afghan recruits had been deprived of a basic education during their country's decades of turmoil. An estimated 80 to 90 percent could not read or write. ***Some could not count or did not know their colors***. Yet the Americans expected them to embrace PowerPoint presentations and operate complex weapons systems.” (emphasis added).\n\nThis got my head spinning. Before the writing down of abstract numbers, did people simply never use abstract numbers in their lives? \n\nI'm reminded of how the Romans did not have a **ZERO**, and how the Ancient Greeks could not see the color **BLUE**. \n\nI'd be fascinated to hear if scholars have looked into this intersection between abstract numbers and literacy.",

This goes back to about 600 B.C.\n\n\nWhich, to my uneducated brain, somewhat makes sense. Middle and Old English would be pretty difficult for modern English speakers to read, but that can be attributed to the fact that English writing changes to accommodate pronunciations, and as time goes on, pronunciations change and so do spellings and words. Meanwhile, written Chinese was designed to make sure it was legible by people of all different dialects of Chinese with vastly different pronunciations, so even though modern Mandarin sounds nothing like Middle or Old Chinese, the writing should still be comprehensible to a modern reader. I’ve even heard that the traditional/simplified divide is pretty easily ignored by a lot of simplified users who can still somewhat read traditional.\n\n\nOr is the TvTropes claim total bogus and Chinese grammar and vocabulary changed to much for a modern Chinese high schooler to be able to read ancient Chinese texts?\n\n\nTvTropes link: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ChineseLanguage",

        "text": "Good Day AskHistorians!\n\nFirst off, I absolutely loved the answers I received the first time around I asked my question - I’ve really learned a lot since I started reading this subreddit (and had many of my previous notions overturned and corrected).\n\nI didn’t see this addressed in the FAQ, but I assume this has already been answered to some extent before.\n\nNamely, I’d love to know the truth over how the Ancient Greeks viewed women, their power, autonomy, status, class differences, and, if we have accounts from the women themselves. And, if we have sources, from earlier periods as well, specifically the Minoan women, as seen as the Blue Ladies and on various frescos.\n\nTo begin, I know Pericles’ speech put a rather fine point on it where he seemed to indicate that women shouldn’t be publicly visible, and that I remember learning how women in Athens were basically prisoners in their own homes to protect against the husband’s fear that his children wouldn’t be his own.\n\nBy contrast, the YouTube channel Historia Civilis painted Spartan high-class women as uniquely powerful, and that even Spartan kings were beholden to groups of rich and powerful women (source: [https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ppGCbh8ggUs&amp;t=318s](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ppGCbh8ggUs&amp;t=318s)).\n\nAlso, it strikes me as…odd… that for all the assumed sexual oppression, the Athenians at least made females, their roles, and their sexualities a central theme in their surviving plays. The sexuality of Clytemnestra, almost overturning sexual norms by the way she describes killing Agamemnon, is a powerful example. I can see why the easy answer is ‘she’s a bad guy and presented in a way to say ‘don’t act like this’’ - but I would think even the Ancient Greeks would have some degree of sympathy and understanding for Clytemnestra killing her absent, daughter-sacrificing husband…\n\nFurthermore, in a society with a large leisure class, I assume the slaves and servants were far more egalitarian in their gender roles - out of necessity perhaps? Or lack of money to afford wife-prisons? Thereby, if I’m an upper-class Greek woman, and I’m basically a prisoner, I’d be a little more than miffed that all my lower class servant girls could run around, have fun, and even…dare I say… marry for love?\n\nThen there are the beautiful and brilliant poems of Sapho…\n\nAnd last but not least, I was brought to tears the other day while listening to the audiobook *Sailing the Wine Dark Sea*, wherein the narrator quotes in full the dialogue between Hector and Andromache with little Astyanax in the *Iliad*. This appears to suggest, among other things, that love existed far before Shakespeare, and the scene gives real human colour to a family relationship that even modern readers could recognize as similar to their own.\n\nThanks!",

        "text": "\nHello Everyone!   \n\n\nI'll get straight to it. I'm working on a series of Epic Fantasy novels based within a world that is heavily inspired by the events, legends and prominent cultures of the Viking Age. One of the major backdrops at the beginning of my story features a rising warlord who, for story reasons I'll not bore you lot with, has spent years fighting to unite his people as their first king. They're a proud, warrior people who content themselves with raiding their neighbors, drinking, feasting, and doing their best to be worthy of having songs written of their deeds. All fine and dandy heroic Viking buffoonery. They've never ever ever had any kings in all their history, at least never on a grand scale and never any that were remotely successful. But I'm stuck! I've come to a point in the story where the would-be king is meeting with his most trusted vassals, and they must decide the next course of action in their quest for unification. I have a plan narratively beyond this point, but realism in the way that these cultures are adapted into my world is very important to me.  \n\n\nSo, what I need to figure out is: How would such a leader even begin to navigate this? I've read that the Vikings used the sun and stars to navigate the sea, and that they didn't use maps. Is this true also for how they would travel by land? If there were no maps, how would an ambitious warlord successfully expand his territory? A big part of being a successful commander is, I believe, having an understanding of terrain and how to use it to your advantage. How did these people find their way around or go about establishing borders? How would someone intent on uniting an entire culture in a large nation-sized region obtain knowledge of landscape in hostile territory or establish supply lines, conduct sieges, etc. during this period of history? What would a king on campaign do when meeting with his generals, how would that war-council look?",

The law is much more relaxed when it comes to samurai killing peasants.\n\nBut I can't find any primary or secondary sources that actually cite details about the laws and what exactly the text of that law regarding duel is.\n\nIf anyone can help provide some context it would be much appreciated.

So probably some medieval historians may be able to answer this question even without knowing exactly what Dante's Inferno talks about. \n\nI've been researching the \"geography\" of Hell in Dante's vision since my professor has talked about it in class, and I still haven't found a clear explanation. My professor isn't clear about this too. \n\nSome sources describe Hell as a \"funnel\", so I guessed the circles of hell are not really circles? Like, they do not go all around the centre of the Earth. But then some other sources are really insistent on calling them circles and hint that Dante and Vergil go \"around\" the circles. I don't understand if they are like the structure of Heaven in the Divine Comedy: concentric circles that surround Earth. \n\nSo I'm asking if anyone knows what Medieval Catholic thought was like for the topography of Hell.",
