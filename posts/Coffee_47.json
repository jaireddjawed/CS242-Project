        "text": "Hello!\n\nFor the longest time I've been a tea drinker, lamenting the fact that the smell of ground coffee is the best thing in the world and bears zero resemblance to the actual taste of the beverage. However, a few days ago I had my first cup of coffee - straight, black, without any additions - without making any faces. I actually liked it in a way. Thus, I started looking into getting myself means of making coffee. However I soon ran into issues, and now I'm hoping that you might lend me a hand.\n\nI live alone and don't drink that much in terms of hot beverages: One or two cups a day maybe, on a good day? So I would need something that lets me make a single cup with close to same convenience as having a teabag and a kettle, since if I have a bigger setup, it will make far too much coffee for me to drink and I don't bake enough to use that lefrover coffee.\n\nOn the other hand I would like the option of making more. I live in Finland, and the traditional way of drinking coffee here is to make a big ol' pot of drip for your guests. I know though, that I'll never use something like a Moccamaster (used to be a really big thing here, don't judge) on my own, and I wouldn't even have the space or electrical sockets for it.\n\nI was considering an aeropress: It wouldn't need electricity, it gives me a cup if I want it, but what the heck do I do when I suddenly need coffee for 4 or more people? I've been alos considering a moka pot.\n\nAlso, I got some pre ground coffee for christmas, seemed to be some sort of big gift bag that was the same for everyone or else the coffee wouldn't make sense given for all they knew at the time I didn't drink coffee. The coffee is ground to drip/french press style, but I've personally enjoyed espresso and moka style coffee more and my intention is to get a hand grinder and start grinding my own beans to moka pot/espresso level... but I'd still need something that can handle the gift bag of coffee grounds.  \n\n\nTo sum it up: Just learned to like coffee like two days ago. I like espresso, lack the space and electrical sockets for a big machine. Commonly I only need 1 cup at a time but occasionally need a potful. I'm in possession of a bag of pre ground that I would need to use but am considering buying and grinding my own beans in the future.  \n\n\nIs there any kind of set up of a grinder and a brewing system that'd help me accomplish all of this? Budget wise I would prefer to spend at maximum 500 € but the budget can be up to doubled with enough justification. 0 to 300 is the comfort range. Oh, and if the coffee grinder in question can be adapted to handle spices, nuts and herbs then I'd be happy to get myself two, one for coffee and one for spices.",

I'm hoping all of the experts here will kindly share their tasting notes if they think they know of a coffee I'd enjoy drinking black.\n\nHere are my specs:\n\nI live in Nova Scotia, Canada. Not in the city, but in a tiny rural town, so stores don't have a ton of options.\n\nI'm willing to order online, but paying for shipping is painful and it's hard to click *purchase* if I have to pay it. I don't love using Amazon either.\n\nI have a French press, pour over, grinder, scale, etc.\n\nI haven't tried a ton of different coffee, but from what I've had, my favourites have been acidic and lighter roasts. (For some reason saying this gives me anxiety, like these preferences are actually a personality quiz that I've failed.)\n\n\nIf anyone has any suggestions at all, I would appreciate it.

        "text": "Hi folks, I'm hoping someone can help give me some guidance on how brew better coffee. My goals are to maximize aroma and minimize bitterness. I feel like I'm doing something wrong. I buy fresh (within \\~1 week of roasting) medium-roast beans which I store it in an air-tight coffee container (I never replace the little C02 valve though), and it lasts me about a week (the coffee tastes pretty bad by the end of the week after I open the bag). I have the strength figured out (grounds to water ratio). I grind it roughly in the middle of the fine to course settings dial (very slightly more towards the coarse). I then brew it in a regular cheap Walmart coffee brewer. Because I only brew one cup for myself, if I just put the pot under the coffee maker and let it brew, there's so little water in my one cup that all of the grounds won't even come in contact with the water. For this reason, I remove the pot from the coffee maker and let the hot water accumulate inside the basket for a few minutes, stir it with a spoon and then put the coffee pot in place to let it drop into the pot.\n\nThe coffee is okay, but it's never as good as when I get the same drip coffee brewed from the coffee shop I get it from. I suspect that some of the culprits might be:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Coffee beans just aren't fresh enough 1 week after roasting\n* Grind setting\n* Letting the coffee sit in the basket for a few minutes, causing over-extraction\n* Perhaps the water temperature is off in the cheapo Walmart coffee maker\n\nThat's all I can think of.. maybe I should just measure the water temperature myself, switch to pour-over and increase the grind coarseness (and therefore also increase the quantity of beans)? Anything else I'm missing?\n\nThank you!",

Takes 5 minutes for first drips to flow from the chimney. Total brew time = **30 seconds** (start of flow to finish). Pull off of heat and submerge in cold water as soon as gurgling begins. \n\nPour **50g double shot** into a cup then froth **50g milk** and do some artsy latte stuff. \n\n**Results:** It's pretty damn tasty - balanced, with coffee tartness/roasty flavor still coming through the milk.

        "text": "Hello, this will probably be a pretty sizeable post because I just have so many questions! I work at  Starbucks (I know, most ppl don't actually consider that as a \"real\" barista, but I'm trying ok) and making drinks at work, they taste great. I only started drinking lattes a few weeks ago because Im not HUGE on coffee. I was thinking about leaving the company eventually, and have been buying a lot of sugar free syrups for my flavored water, and I figured why not get a cheap espresso machine so I can make lattes or even try some foam art. \n\nSo, I got this machine off Amazon, called an IMUSA (not promo just info that may be needed to help me) espresso maker. It's about 5 bar pressure? I initially tried using a moka pot but the espresso tasted horrible. So I got this machine, measured out about 4 fluid oz, 14g of Starbucks espresso that I ground at work.\n\nFirst let me say, yall were completely right about it tasting burnt. Like, wow. It's BAD. It looks and tastes it too. Once it measured to a little over 2 oz of espresso, since I put syrup into the same carafe the espresso poured in to. I turned off the machine, combined it with my milk and it was ultra bitter. I expected this, knowing the warnings but it's the only espresso I could find on hand. \n\nSo, here's my questions I would really like to know!\n\n1. Does blonde decaf espresso exist? I want to use decaf espresso.\n\n2. If not blonde, is there any lighter/sweeter decaf espresso I could get off Amazon? Don't want a caffiene addiction lol\n\n3. Is decaf cold brew a thing? For my lazy days? Is it worth the hassle?\n\n4. ANY tips would be great. We're my measurements okay?\n\n5. Best tasting alternative milks with low sugar? \n\n6. Your favorite sugar free coffee syrup, I'm looking in to buying more than just hazelnut and vanilla 🫡\n\n7. Is there anything I should have done differently?\n\n\nI know it's ironic I make coffee all day and know this little about making it at home, but I seriously appreciate anyone who answers!",

        "text": "COFFEE REVIEW!!!\nPrivate Selection - Kona Blend\n$8 at Smith’s\n\nOverall Grade: F\n\nPros:\n- Bag is easy to work with\n- Pleasant aroma\n- No roast discrepancies\n- Smooth (not bitter)\n- Acceptable caffiene strength\n\nCons:\n- Poor bag seal and Co2 valve\n- Questionable freshness\n- Small beans with poor uniformity\n- No flavor to speak of\n- Even worse with cream!\n\nI hear Hawaii has some of the best coffee in the world. After enjoying Private Selection's Guatemalan Antiguan, I was thrilled to try their Kona Blend. The question is, how many of these beans are truly grown and harvested on The Big Island? Private Selection is silent on this. Looking at what other companies charge for a bag of coffee with just a few Kona beans inside, I'm sure this $8.00 bag doesn't have many. Speaking of the bag, it appears that the problem I had with Guatemalan Antiguan is not unique to Guatemalan Antiguan and affects all of Private Selection's coffee: faulty seals and ineffective Co2 valves. I want quality and freshness, which means no puffy bags filled with air. At the very least, the bag is made of that wonderful \"matte\" plastic that is easy to re-seal.\n\nWhen I opened this bag, I was treated to a delicate, sweet fragrance of honey blended with some smokiness. The beans themselves were sporadic at best. Some were small, some were large, some were light brown, and others were dark brown. This could be because this coffee is technically a \"blend,\" but generally all of the beans should be the same size and color. Half point here. Though the beans grind well, I didn't notice any crema or Co2 bubbles when brewing in my pour-over. I also didn't get the \"cinnamon swirl\" I like to see on the second and third pours. This could hint that the beans aren't as fresh.\n\nThis coffee is really smooth; there are no bitter notes in it at all. It has low acidity, a disturbingly light and thin body, and a prolonged, gentle finish. To be honest, this Kona Blend doesn't taste like anything. It has the thickness of water and the flavor of air. Strangely, this coffee has the ability to totally neutralize any flavor of cream that you add to it. So not only does the coffee flavor not cut through with cream, but neither does the cream flavor! This coffee was a big problem for me. Needless to say, getting to the bottom of the bag was a challenge I did not expect to have.\n\nThe Kona Blend from Private Selection is an anomaly. It defies logic that coffee from a brand I respect, sourced from an area known for producing the best coffee in the universe, could be this terrible. It's always a bummer when I come across a coffee that I despise, but I know that these disappointing experiences are inevitable. I've now had both extremely good and very dreadful experiences with Private Selection, and I'm not sure if I'll try their next bag. I will think about it more later, but for now, I'd rather just forget this one.",

I'd be curious to learn why dark is the predominant roast in the US. Admittedly, I don't have very extensive knowledge of coffee culture abroad. \n\nI feel like many people would like light roast better. I find it has more complex flavors (and caffeine!). My hypothesis is that part of reason people load up their coffee with cream and sugar and fake flavor is because they have a dark roast that just tastes bitter and burnt. \n\nAny info out there as to why we have the current retail coffee paradigm?",

Needless to say, I was eager to try it for myself. The bag itself is well-made and easy to use. The beans are large, and they are perfectly uniform. However, even with a nice hand grinder, I struggled to achieve a satisfactory grind. This suggests that the beans might not be as flawless as they appear to be.\n\nThe scent that greeted me was quite roasty and meaty, almost like a really powerful steak seasoning. In the back end, I could discern a faint nutty sweetness, but it was very subtle.\n\nThis coffee has a heavy body and low to medium acidity. The mouthfeel is bone dry. The flavor tells me that this coffee isn't designed to entertain or make you feel brilliant; it's almost non-existent. It's not nutty, fruity, or earthy. It tastes like business, industry, and carbon. It's perhaps the most boring coffee ever, which may be desirable for some people, I suppose. It does have the natural smokiness of dark roasted coffee, and I found that it does cut through with cream. At the end of the day, I can't give this coffee a pass for flavor because I wouldn't buy it again based solely on flavor. And because I almost fell asleep halfway through my cup, I can confidently say that the caffeine strength is really low. Even a minimal level of caffeine should have done the trick for me.\n\nUltimately, I believe this coffee does the polar opposite of what coffee should do. I imagine Major Dicakson's is offered to the Dunder Mifflin employees selling printer paper all day in their office building. I'm shocked this is sold at the price it is, and even more surprised that people keep buying it when there are far better options available at virtually any local market. Unfortunately, it will be a long while before I try another bag of Peet’s.",
