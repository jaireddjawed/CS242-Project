(he started catching feelings and decided it was best to end it, maybe it was a fwb thing, i didn’t ask). so we end up spending more time together, lunch, shows. we have similar interests. after a couple of weeks i’m noticing she’s becoming more interested in me than i was in her. she started to really like me. this was a surprise to me. i was not expecting it. i don’t know what i expected. i found that when someone wants to be closer to me, i push away. i was abandoned as a child. i’m afraid to love. her attachment grew stronger after we had sex (i know, what did i expect). a couple of months later i find myself almost pretending to be her boyfriend. i say “almost” because we never made it clear what we were. we started a relationship without defining it. i’m hesitant even though i enjoy spending time with her and find her attractive. tbh sometimes it’s a lot for me. i don’t know if i can love her the way she loves me. i’ve talked to her about my fear of love. she understands but i feel like she wants to stick it out for me. i don’t want that for her. it feels unfair to her. so i wrote this message. i’ll likely tell her in person",

He was previously in an office relationship that ended poorly, and I respected that. I asked for space, and we spotted speaking then.\n\nToday we went for a walk for two hours, and it felt lovely to laugh with him again and shoot the shit. I'm in a relationship now, so I wasn't expecting anything other than a friendly walk and talk, which was happening.

He thought it might be good to tell me now, but he wasn't sure. I told him I was surprised and disgusted. I felt swept with emotional whiplash. \n\nI consumed myself with sadness about how my insecurities and anxious behavior pushed him away after we broke up. There were so many moments where I could tell he was playing games, but I believed his words because I didn't trust my gut. \n\nNope, it turns out he was seeing someone else and didn't know how to tell me because he didn't want me to tell our colleagues. Not that he didn't want me to stop seeing him in case I wasn't into poly relationships. He didn't want his colleagues to know he was dating multiple people...I'm so embarrassed. \n\n I've since spent the day reflecting on my current relationship and my desire to ignore the ways we're incompatible.\n\nHave any of you had to practice, in a way, trusting your gut again? I don't know if I've ever been 100% about trusting my instincts, but the stakes seem higher the longer I wait to learn.",

I’ve been tormented for the last year about a friendship breakup I’ve experienced. My friend and I had been friends since middle school (now early 30s) we have been through so much together, and I never imagined life without her. \n\nA couple years ago, an atom bomb went off in my life when my partner and father of my son died from depression. My friend was there for a few weeks then slowly stopped talking to me, checking in on me, rejecting any invites or conversation starters. I realize we are all adults and have our own lives and I wasn’t expecting her to be on call, but I was disappointed at the lack of support i was getting. We never had a true fight, but I did tell her to not bother coming to my son’s birthday party. We have spoken once since and that was a year ago now. I did apologize over text, and she said she was sorry too. That was all that was said. Clearly she’s not interested. If she has a more peaceful life without me then who am I to stop her?\n\nI feel very devastated and full of shame. Not only did my partner abandon me but someone I trusted as a sister did too. I have had anger issues and lash out at people close to me, especially since the loss of of partner. I feel like a toxic, unlovable mess. I don’t want to wallow in self pity. There are a good handful people in my life who love me. I am accomplishing goals, showing up for my son, and have been seeking professional help. \n\nThis friendship loss weighs heavily on my heart. I see her “like” a post on social media sometimes and it breaks my heart all over again. She definitely doesn’t like any of mine anymore. I’m aware how petty that sounds.\n\nI’m almost in shock about how much it hurts to lose a friend. I’m open to advice about how to not hyperfixate on rejection, how to let go of control, and how to resist the temptation to continually try to prove that I am lovable. \nIf you’ve made it this far, thank you!",

        "text": "Some of you might not think that this is triggering but others might be triggered. It is the experience that many women go through unfortunately, but I never knew that this would feel so strongly. \n\nThis is especially because the person who sexually harassed me was my friend. \n\nMy friend (woman) is a pushy and aggressive person. She already had a couple of red flags attached to her, one of which was that she had no friends. I didn't know this until years later when she confessed to me that she had no friends. I also didn't realize how jealous she must've been whenever I was hanging out with my friends and made connections with other people. \n\nShe became more possessive and aggressive after setting me up with dates. None of them worked out because me and the dates didn't click, at least from my perspective. The more I said no, the more she pushed my boundaries and sent me aggressive text messages, like how I have impossibly high standards, how I'll be single forever, so on. \n\nI took a break from her and then later explained that I needed some space to breathe because she was being too aggressive and pushy. I told her that I didn't like how she was acting towards me, and she would have none of it. \n\nShe didn't get it! The problem was, she didn't understand that I didn't like how she was acting toward me. Then when I tried explaining it to her more explicitly, she acted as if she was the victim and we ended up brushing the issue aside. I felt so uncomfortable talking to her. \n\nAnyway, she became more aggressive towards me. Later, she kept sending inappropriate messages and pictures that were just disgusting and in poor taste over the phone. She even sent me photos of her child's faecal matter smeared all over the room. Aside from that one photo, almost all of the photos contained some type of inappropriate sexual nature. Looking back, I wish that I could've documented them better. I tried laughing it off while hinting that I felt extremely uncomfortable for her doing so. \n\nShe later broke off the friendship with me because she couldn't control me. She tried to make me submit to her by making me come to her house. I couldn't go to her house at the time and she used that as an excuse, among other things that were of issue to her (such as me breaking off the dates, me needing a break from her, me not being able to tell her the reason why I needed a break from her, wtf) to break off from me. \n\nYears passed.\n\nI took a seminar about sexual harassment and it hit me. Word for word, I realized that sexual harassment didn't have to be about the person inappropriately touching me. \n\nShe had sexually harassed me over the phone by sending unwarranted sexual pictures. She crossed my boundaries so many times by breaking my consent. Sexual harassment is when someone does something that makes you feel uncomfortable because it breaks your boundaries, your consent, your dignity as a human. And she did exactly that. \n\nI realized that it's no wonder why she had no friends. She was the bad friend, not me. \n\nI don't know what to do anymore. She sexually harassed me. She's also extremely homophobic and transphobic. She also works with vulnerable minors and pretends to be a saint while she's a total hypocrite on the inside. \n\nSo yeah... That's my story.

Two days later my ex reached out to me and asked me to get together. My ex showed me his true colours on multiple occasions and hurt my feelings horribly but for reasons I don’t understand myself I still had feelings for him. Which is why I stupidly accepted the invite over (when the roommate was gone out of town) We hooked up and today (just now) I realized he removed me from all social media and pulled a disappearing act! \n\nHonestly I can’t even say I’m surprised at this point because like I said he showed me his true colours on multiple occasions long ago.

I have a lot of insecurities around my looks and body image and this relationship has massively triggered all my “stuff” - I now feel completely shut off to dating and unsure of how to break out of this funk. \n\nHe was very critical of many aspects of my life, career choices etc and made a lot of negative comments about other women’s bodies, including graphic comments about previous sex partners genitals. He also told me how he found his housemate’s curves “repulsive” when I myself am a curvy woman. I dread to think what he was thinking about my body! These comments have really stayed with me and I still feel extremely uncomfortable with the thought of being naked and vulnerable with a man again. \n\nI appreciate taking time off dating is totally valid but it’s been nearly two years now and feel like this is some kind of trauma response rather than an empowered decision. I’m so annoyed that this douche has totally taken away my ability to open up and be vulnerable with people. I don’t want to give him that power! I’m also extremely paranoid that there were clearly so many glaring red flags that I either didn’t see, or saw and chose to ignore, that I don’t think I can trust my judgement with men anymore. \n\nAny advise on how to deal and move on from this? I feel so bruised and wary from this awful experience.",

I felt it was a boundary and we discussed it and she swore nothing happened. Over the last several months my spouse has made some comments that she refuses to discuss further. These comments are usually out of the blue she says it then changes the subject. For example she has said that.. she lies to me, she treats me like crap, if I knew what she had done I would never want to have sex with her again. She has also made comments out loud to herself that I overheard, like that she wonders why she always falls for bad guys etc.. when I ask her to explain what she means she changes the subject or gets upset.\nHow can I approach her and help her feel comfortable talking to me about the comments she made? They are very troubling and have caused me so much anxiety. All I would like to do is clear things up and keep working on the relationship. I'm at a loss. I can't just let this go. I asked her again and she said it didn't mean anything and she doesn't even remember saying some of those things and even if she did she didn't mean anything by them",

Most important to me was creating safety for women (and minority groups) in society in as many ways as possible, including creating equal opportunities.\n\nOver the last few years, I find myself strongly struggling with identifying as a feminist because of strong and even violent leanings of anger towards men in words and actions. (I very much empathize and understand the underlying trauma, hurt, struggles, and have come to a place of healing in my own world.)\n\nThere is still a lot of work to do. \n\nNonetheless, I don’t understand how our cultural narrative has gone to a place of wide-scale disrespect towards ALL men by large swaths of women at work and in dating. The “Kill All Men” movement broke my heart. The lack of accountability by women in relationships breaks my heart (not talking about abuse - just that it takes two to tango). \n\nSo, I am curious about your thoughts about how we can get back to a place of love and equality, and am seriously contemplating asking us all to band together to start a new wave premised on respect for all. \n\nWhat are your ideas and thoughts? \n\n\n\n\n(As an aside - I know my name can throw some of you off, but I promise I am in a very consensual, kinky, happy BDSM relationship where I identify as a slave, among other fun identities. 🕊️)",

However, there are deal breakers such as their career direction(or lack thereof) and smoking. On top of that - from what I perceive, it is platonic on his end.

I really enjoyed each date and he is the first man who I have been genuinely interested in for a long time and wanted to pursue.\n\nHe’s not on social media, neither seems to be an avid texter. I often questioned his interest (to my friends), but I would still end up hearing from him at least every other day for the most part. Texts were engaging, thoughtful, flirty. I was willing to overlook his sparse texting because of how he was in person, and also understanding that not everyone is glued to their phones or enjoys texting.\n\nAfter our 4th date he told me he had a fever. I bring this up because we had planned our 5th date for 1/4. I had some back pain so I asked to move to 1/5 and he said great. Night of 1/4 he lets me know he has a fever. I know this time of year people are sick, but I found it odd he had seemingly two separate fevers / illnesses 2 weeks apart. I already assumed we would cancel and he texts me on 1/5 in the afternoon to let me know he still isn’t feeling great. We exchange a few messages. He’s very sweet. I say “I look forward to rescheduling when you are feeling better.” He does not reply to this.\n\nHe now hasn’t sent me any messages for 5 days. My last message was the one above.\n\nI am assuming he ghosted me.\n\nIt hurts because at this point I would think we gone out enough for him to send a closure text. Plus, we have been intimate.\n\nThe reason for my question is maybe he has put me “on the bench” while he talks and meets with other women, but isn’t sure and that is why no closure. I also get this is normal and probably the advice I would get until I become official with a bf.\n\nOn our 5th date I was going to ask him where he sees this going. Not something I would want to text.\n\nI saw potential with him, but I’m obviously not okay with this behavior (ghosting, breadcrumbing, bench-warming, etc.). I’m making assumptions, but I believe them to be realistic.\n\nSo if he were to reach out and ask me out again - would you reply?\nWould it depend how long he goes without messaging, or if he has an apology and excuse, does him being sick make a difference, do you think he would deserve another chance? \n\nFinding someone I like [getting to know] this much has been has been hard. I have swiped and swiped, gone out with other men, but frankly I rather take a break than start with more first dates.\n\nHave you been in a similar situation and it worked out? \n\nTIA!",

        "text": "I'm 46, but I wasn't sure where else to post this, lol!  I have grey roots that need to be colored every 5-6 weeks, but I also get highlights every 3 months or so.  I tend to go very blonde in the summer, and then I dial it back a little in the winter.  I finally found someone who translates exactly what I ask for, into the hair I get.\n\nI broke up with my previous hair stylist because the price just kept going up and up and when you have to get roots done every 5-6 weeks, this just becomes a problem. I also didn't like how subtle she was with my highlights.  They always looked the same, and she always made me feel guilty about going blonde, because she'd make comments about how it \"wouldn't look natural\", blah blah.  I am old enough to know what looks good on me and what doesn't, you know?   So I found a new guy that's closer to my house and HALF the price.  And I've been seeing him for about a year, and every time I leave, I'm so happy with my results. \n\nBut here's the catch:  I find him a little too \"friendly\". \n\nFor the record, he's straight.  He's married with 3 kids and his family also works in the salon with him.  He has owned it for 20 years.  He's originally from Turkey and he's done a great job with my hair.  He's super chatty (with ALL his clients).  He's got clients that have come to him for years and they are affectionate with each other, and he's definitely more of a \"friendly\" guy with all female clients. I think part of his friendliness may be cultural.  I have lived overseas several times (my parents were foreign service) so I am VERY familiar with the idea that in certain cultures, men are much more vocal with women than American men would be.  And quite frankly, the female clients I've witnessed coming in and out before me or after me, seem to reciprocate this relationship - they kiss on the cheek, they say things like \"thank you baby\" or see you later love\".  \n\nI want to make sure I paint this picture accurately, it's an environment that seems to be very close/friendly, not in an outrageous way, but definitely more than the salons I've been to previously. Clearly, this new to me.  I've never been to a straight male before, lol!  I'm not opposed to being chummy with my hairstylist, but I've literally never been in this sitch before.  We both workout, so naturally, our workouts come up in conversation while I'm in the chair.  He asks what I do, I ask what he does, etc. etc.  We commiserate with each other about how much we love food, so we will never be as \"shredded\" as we want, and that we both go through phases where we get lazy and fall off the wagon. \n\nWell last week, we were talking about how we wanted to get back on the fitness wagon this year, and he was saying he is going to dial in his nutrition....yadda yadda....I said something like yeah, \"maybe I'll actually have a before and after this year\" and then he asked to see a picture of me when I was in the \"best shape\". I kind of chuckled nervously, and said I don't really have a lot of those, lol.  And he was like, \"Oh come on, we all have them\" and asked again.  The only thing I felt comfortable pulling up was a workout video I took a years ago where I had been strength training and lot, and I had a lot of definition in my arms, and I wanted to make sure I was using proper form.  So he watched it and he was like, \"Oh yeah...I see it! Your arms look great!\" And then he was like, \"Okay, but now show me the selfies\".  And I was like, Huh?  He was like, \"You know, the 'before' picture or the 'after' picture where you take the selfie in the mirror?\".  And I chuckled, but blew it off, and he was like, \"I'll show you mine if you show me yours\".   So....because I'm non confrontational, I found ONE picture of me in a bathing suit that I sent to a macro coach last year.  And he was like \"now Zoom in\".  And I chuckled nervously again and said, \"Uh, maybe next time.\"  \n\nOKAY - YA'LL.  WHAT IS HAPPENING. \n\nDid he really just say \"zoom in\" to a photo of me in a bikini in my bedroom?  That maybe one other person in this world has seen (my macro coach?)   I mean......is this weird?  Or....am I just an old prude?!  I get that when you're in the fitness/nutrition space, there IS going to be conversations about bodies and I am definitely someone who has always felt super insecure about mine.  I HATE selfies.   \n I am NOT one of those people that posts tons of pictures of my face or my body.  If anything, I'm just the opposite.  And for the record, he did show me his picture of being in \"good shape\" and it wasn't pervy or anything (it was just from the arms up).  So I'm not sure if I'm over-reacting???!! But now I feel like I don't want to go back to this guy!",

He's buying himself a vintage jacket and out drinking. \n\nIt all ended when he invited me over to make me dinner (finally)..., and on my way, he says he stopped to get a drink and I should join him...he was drunk. Dinner was not made. He blew up at me and yelled at me (because I was upset his ex was at the bar, and asked him why he stayed when he knows she makes me feel uncomfortable).

        "text": "She's been super possessive of me her entire life. Oops... I meant mine. Ever since I was a young girl, we've been \"best friends\". That came with a lot of abuse and most of it was verbal but some of it was physical. Lots of name-calling throughout my youth, she picked on me for being insecure about my looks, called me a \"bitch,\" etc. When my dad was alive, she'd team up with my dad and make fun of me while I was in the room. \n\nWhen I became pregnant at the age of 30, I was homeless and didn't have anywhere to go. So I called her and mistakenly went back to the house where I was basically born. She did nothing to advocate for me and help me keep my kid. So I ended up giving my kid for adoption.\n\n My kid is being raised by somebody who couldn't care less about me and I hardly get to see him as a result. \n\nMy father died about 2 years ago and now my mom has dementia that is fairly severe. She needs a lot of help, so I help her. I take care of all the bills and everything that needs to be taken care of. \n\nI guess the thing is... I can't find a partner to save my life and have always had trouble finding someone who is of good quality. I've been an abusive relationship after abusive relationship and I'm fairly sure that my childhood is partially a reason why. \n\nNow I spend every day with my mom. I take her out to eat and go out and do things. It's better than it was, since now she's not able to be abusive. But the monotony of it is horrifying to me. I wake up every evening wondering when my life is going to change. I wonder when she's going to go. It's horrible but I just want to live my own life. \n\nI'm 36 years old, I'm not getting any younger. I feel like I'll never get married or have kids of my own, let alone a career. I can't work full-time because I'm tied up with taking care of her. I feel like I'm going to die old, alone, single. All because I spent time with my mom instead of going and finding somebody to create a life with. \n\nI look at all the couples and people with kids and I just feel this incredible way of sadness and I wonder if I'll ever experience the joy that it is to raise my own child. I feel so hopelessly stuck with my mother. I'm so tired of her sometimes... I just want to live my own life and I feel very guilty about not wanting to be with her. I don't know what to do. \n\nIt's every night I'm waking up and I'm thinking about what I've missed out on by listening to her and giving my child to somebody else to raise. I hate my situation. I'm just looking for some kind of perspective.",

        "text": "Characters, all in our early to mid thirties:\n\nMe - woman \n\nFriend - woman, K\n\nHusband of friend, also my friend - man\n\nThis came to my attention recently, and I'm quite blindsided. \n\nSome background: He and I are not close friends. As in, we don't have a tight personal friendship nor do we really chat privately. He and I met through mutual local friends. Whenever we're hanging out, it's on our public gaming server. This is a server of friends, a mixture of online and irl friends, for a specific game we all play. This group goes back about six years. We're a chill bunch, as is K's husband, so it's a nice atmosphere. Also, since we're all in our thirties and most people are in long-term relationships, the drama is non-existent. People aren't sliding into DMs or trying to be weird. We're in the loop of the major happenings of each other's lives, bonding beyond our game, but none of us are in each other's faces or invasive. All this is to highlight and underscore that general maturity of our group lol. \n\nHe was one of the first of our group to marry, so our friends made a special effort with his wife. I felt a coolness from her, but figured it was in my head. K and I became good friends over the last two years. She's hilarious and we have a lot in common. We talk nearly daily, privately. K can be a bit hot and cold at times. But I chalked it up to some personal esteem struggles she's described dealing with.\n\nA few days ago, one of our friends (D, another woman) took me aside. She showed me a screenshot of a conversation she had with K. It was all about me and my friendship with K's husband. K talked about how much she *hates* that he and I are friends. K worried that I might have feelings for him. Or that he might have feelings for me. K said that she hasn't nothing to go off for feeling this way. \n\nK went on to say that she considers me a friend now and loves our friendship, but still thinks it's wrong I'm friends with her husband. D mentioned this wasn't the first time K has confided in her like this about the friendship. Because I'm recently single, K knows this and the demise of my relationship is apparently amplifying her nerves. \n\nI'm pretty gutted. I really like her. I've tried to be so friendly and warm with her, and I thought we'd built up a mutually admiring friendship. We've sent each other gifts, and after they moved to another state, we've had movie nights etc on discord. It was always just her and I, not even with him. Our friendship was US and our interests. Not centered around him. \n\nIt gets potentially hairy here. A few years ago, before they met, her husband and I went on a date. We weren't close friends then either. This was more of a pseudo-blind date our mutual friends encouraged. Nothing came of it, we didn't jive romantically. Our dynamic has been solely as described above. It wasn't ever weird between us, as would be the case with mature adults. We just... moved on and gamed. He met her several months after our one-off date, and he's been in love (and fully devoted) ever since.\n\nAnyways, it's evident his wife doesn't know about this date. I'm SO nervous now, knowing how deep her insecurities are running. I won't broach this with her. It feels like a lose-lose situation. But I'm not sure what to do moving forward. Our friendship doesn't even feel real anymore. Even if she loves our friendship, it souring knowing she's long been suspicious/insecure of me.",

        "text": "I (36f) have been with my boyfriend (52m) for two years now. We do not live together. I've been struggling with some of his behaviors and the way he approaches life and I fear we are just fundamentally too different for a future together.\n\nSpecifically, I find the way he communicates and the way he views the world to be incredibly negative, hateful, and caustic a lot of the time. He is highly critical and judgmental of others and also seems to find a way to nitpick everything I relay to him, by criticizing my friends or my work teammates or my team lead, even when I'm just telling him something innocuous about my day. For example, I told him today about hanging out with a friend I hadn't seen in a while who had just moved back to town. He starts with, \"What is she doing back here, why would you want to move back to (city I live in that he despises \\[he lives in a neighboring rural area\\])\" and then it's \"Is there any money in (career program she is starting)?\" Also \"What did you guys do?\" When I say we just hung out at my place he goes \"What? You just sat there? You didn't go out or get a bite?\" Just...not positive and slightly undermining, I guess?   Then when I tell him the dates I'm going out of town for my sister's baby shower he says \"I thought you were leaving on Friday, not Thursday. Well I guess I'll be eating the cost of the ticket of (event he mentioned in passing over a month ago but never put on our shared calendar like I've asked him to do a million times). Oh wait, it's actually on the 21st so it's fine.\" He then proceeds to tell me a story about a friend who is in search of a real estate agent \"but I guess I can't refer him to you, since you still haven't gotten your (neighboring state) license like I've said you should.\"\n\nWhenever I retort to these things he says, he tells me I'm being defensive and reactionary all the time, but really the way he speaks to me leaves me no room BUT to be defensive, otherwise I'm just being cowed to his snide remarks.\n\nHe also bitches about his ex-wife and his grown children constantly, to the point where I have told him repeatedly that he needs to get therapy because of how cyclical and constant his ranting about them are. I can't do any more to help with the topic and frankly I'm sick of hearing about it.\n\nHe has very black and white thinking about the way the world is and the way people should act and behave and does not have an open mind to the fact that some people do things differently and it doesn't mean they're bad and wrong. He seems to be angry a lot of the time, bitching about all the things he \"fucking hates\" and it's tiresome to be around. But then he'll turn around and say I'm the one who is negative.\n\nWe seem to have very different life goals in some areas - he wants to move away from where we live to somewhere tropical. Meanwhile, I'm getting my career going in the city we live and can't just up and leave. I don't have my own financial stability yet and I refuse to depend on a man to take care of me, so I need to stay and build up savings. So then he bitches about living here all winter long and talks about how the city I live in is going to shit. We do both want to travel a ton, but I also might want kids and he is done with that. \n\nThere are positives, of course - he is caring, is my biggest cheerleader, cooks for me, does many acts of service, has great insight and advice sometimes, generally seems to adore me.\n\nBut the passive-aggressiveness (which I have demanded he stop before), the overall anger and negativity and acidic tone about everything, and his underhanded nasty remarks to me absolutely enrage me. Him acting like I'm the problem by \"being defensive\" is really just him not being a good communicator. How should I proceed? How do I approach this with him and what is the actual issue here?",

He's a great guy though and the more I pull away the less I want to go through with it.

He really loves me and I know that I'll miss him when he's gone. Can anyone relate? I'm not sure if I'm scared of taking the plunge to dive into a serious relationship, or just scared to get out. I know I sound extremely passive. I'm just scared I'm throwing away a good thing for nothing. How do you know?",

There are a few reasons I’ve identified that are contributing to how I feel: \na) I was bullied at primary school and was not helped or supported by the teachers (they told me to pray for my bullies) so I worry about that for her\nb) I have philosophical qualms about putting children into school too early \nc) I will miss hanging out with her - I worry it will change our relationship and that we won’t have fun anymore.\n\nI know the school my daughter is going to. It’s a lovely one with a great culture. I’ve also been told by her kindy teachers that she’s ready for school. My husband is of the opinion that she will love school and I respect where he’s coming from. \n\nI am in therapy and will continue with it. My husband is supportive and thoughtful, I have a great family and social network. My daughter is excited about the prospect of school. But despite all those positives and supports and strategies, my heart is a bit sore and anxious about the future. \n\nAny words of advice?",

I (34F) have a friend (35M) who seems to continue down the path of poor mental health and inability to care about himself. We met in college 15 years ago when we were both optimistic about life, without having to worry about the real world. We remained close for years afterwards, we used to talk on the phone for hours. But slowly things have changed - I have felt at times where I became his therapist and at times have resented it. I have set boundaries with him, which he voiced understanding, but was distant after that. I have watched him go through several failed relationships, job loss, and overall not taking initiative. I have an advanced degree and am quite successful in my job, have close friendships I actively engage in; he remains at his retail job, still lives at home, and pretty much never goes out. I got in a new relationship a couple years ago and admittedly have not had as much time for him, but also have been a bit distant due to not wanting to be drained. I feel like I still want to be friends with him, we used to have so much in common (although I'm not sure as much anymore), and he has proven to be a loyal friend (he was there for me through a breakup, family emergencies, etc.). Do any of you have advice or experience with similar situations?",

I haven't been dating for years at this point but have never been walled-off from the idea of meeting someone. We both went home to our home countries for the holidays but are back in the same country again and starting to see each other in-person. \n\n**The self-sabotage**: I have an intense complex about my looks-- I just wasn't born attractive. Some days I've accepted it more than others but it's just how it is. The man in question is very handsome, tall, and charismatic. And he's stated his intention to pursue whatever is happening between us. \n\nSo naturally I'm left wondering: why me? I offer genuinely nothing on the looks front. I know I have other things to offer but it's just so drilled into my head that a man needs a hot woman, and that's just never something I can be. \n\n**The come to Jesus**: I understand that the above ↑ is highly irrational. Regardless of my looks, at the end of the day it's more than just looks, and it's really up to the other person to decide what they do or don't want, and whether they find my fleshy being attractive. \n\nBut yet the underlining feeling and thus the desire to self-sabotage persists. I really am interested in also seeing out whatever is happening, and I'd like to do it without getting in my own way but I just don't know how. And that leads me to my question: how the hell do I just chill out and not self-sabotage?",

Unfortunately I met her shortly after her spouse passed away tragically and when we met I fell in love with her immediately and we became 'best friends' over night. We became incredibly close and talked/texted every single day. We visited each other multiple times a year.  At the time we bonded over our traumas (my cancer, illness, and divorce) and over our journey to heal. \n\nShe had been dating a guy the past year that was a good 'for now' person, but recently had an affair with a co worker (who doesn't live in the same state) and said she wanted to keep it casual with him.  I told her it wasn't a good idea and there was a lot of risk involved.  I spoke from my own experience in this where I almost lost my job.  At the same time she is an adult and can make her own choices and I told her her situation was different than mine and I would support her no matter what. As this went she developed deeper feelings for him. \n\nInevitably before coming to a christmas party at her town, her coworker broke up with her because he didn't want to jeopardize his career. When she told me this, she said she didn't want to talk about it.  I felt really bad and I said I was sorry that her heart was broken. I didn't pry. \n\nAt this point she did not return any of my messages for two days.  When I reached out again to check on her, she said she was feeling really bad and once again I said I was sorry to hear that, but I didn't know what else to say.  A few days after that when she was acting all cold, I reached out and let her know that it hurt my feelings that she was not communicating with me. she got mad and said I didn't care about her and that she was hurting because she missed her husband and I should have known that was the issue.  She did not communicate to me that this was going on, just went radio silent.  When i tried to tell her this, she got even more upset and said i was gaslighting her and it was unfair for me to be hurt and that all she wanted was for me that i wasn't loving her the right way. I asked for examples and tried to understand.  I apologized to her for not being more sensitive. I apologized for coming off passive aggressive (I didn't mean to but reading my texts later i realized how it could have been taken). I was so upset and cried for days.\n\nShe then stopped talking to me entirely.  The next day she reached out to my bf and he told her that yes I was wrong with my frustration and my comments, but he also said that she needed to take responsibility for not communicating. She also told him that she didn't believe my apology was heartfelt (my bf sat with me when her and i were having the issue and saw me crying and gave me advice on how to best apologize or reply to her). She got upset with him and stopped talking to him as well. \n\nBoth of us were going to send her a substantial financial gift for christmas to help with a theraputic ketamine treatment for her, but we decided not to.  I did end up sending her a sentimental gift of a figurine for christmas but I haven't heard anything back. \n\nI just don't know what to do anymore, and I am so hurt.  I feel like our relationship didn't mean as much to her as it did to me.  Should I bother reaching out and trying to repair this? I've been so upset that it basically ruined christmas and new years and everytime i think about the situation i just start shaking.",

I'm trying to be more intentional this time around since I think having someone I feel really comfortable with will help me be more likely to stick with it. \n\nI'm going to set up a few consultations, but I'm wondering how those of you in therapy chose your therapist? In the past when I've done those consultations I feel like they ask basic questions of why do you want to do therapy and remind me if they're out of pocket and then get me on the schedule, but there's not a lot of evaluating if it's a good fit.\n\nAre there specific questions you asked in a consultation and if so what? Or was it more just did you vibe with them? What type of things told you it would be a good fit or not? Do you prefer online vs in person?\n\nAlso any suggestions of places to look? My insurance covers a good chunk even out of network so I'm not restricted to that. I know PsychologyToday was a big suggestion in the past but it seems like there are a lot of other sites  (like therapyden, headway, etc.) to search on these days?",

I was getting out of a toxic long term relationship and assumed that was the reason that I felt we had no vibe/connection. He works overseas and we lost touch. \n\nCut to a few days ago, I’m in the middle of planning a move abroad and I meet said guy again. He’s great, on paper he is everything I’d want in a guy - kind, caring, a good listener, trustworthy, there’s a certain comfort with him. But why do I feel so disconnected from him? I don’t feel the instant attraction. I’m not unattracted to him but I don’t feel it passionately like I have in the past. \n\nI have so many questions: Am I attracted to dysfunction? Is he too healthy for me? Have any of you ladies been in a situation where the attraction to a partner has been slow? Does it make sense to start something just before I move abroad? \n\nI’m sorry if I’m all over the place, I’m so overwhelmed.",

        "text": "My sister and her husband are very well off.  They make a lot of money. They love to spend money on designer, Michelin starred restaurants, vacations 3-4x a year (maybe more). I'm 31F she is 35F.    \nShe took me and my parents to London this Christmas, and went all out.  She had us stay in a really nice hotel, eat the fanciest meals and the whole deal.  She paid for 99% of the whole trip.  \n\nBefore Christmas, I asked her what she wanted as her gift.  She wanted a pair of boots that were sold out every single time I checked.  I updated her on my progress of finding this gift for her.  Every time I would bring it up, she'd say its ok don't get it for me. (To give some background: my sister does not like to receive gifts that she doesn't want so she tells you what it is she exactly wants.) Up until the last moment, she kept telling me not to get it and that she is fine without it.  For context, in 2020 I lost all sources of income and moved back to my hometown and am currently living with my parents while I am in nursing school.  I work around 22/hrs a week and make $15/hr.  With all that in mind,  I was ok with dishing out $200+ for her gift since she is taking me and my parents to an extremely expensive vacation.  I'm starting the nursing program in Jan, so I have a lot of expenses I need to pay for, especially since I was not approved for any student loans.  \n\nBecause money is tight and she kept insisting that it was okay that I didn't need to get her the boots, I decided to take my 35mm camera and make a photo album of the trip for her.  The trip was great, she didn't really mention anything about money.  My mom and I wanted to buy a pair of shoes while we were in London and told my sister to pick out a pair for herself and she would buy it for her.  Again for context, my parents do not make a lot of money. They work graveyard shifts, 7days a week. They are lower-middle class and especially with the inflation and slow business, it hasn't been a great 3 years for them.  \n\nMy mom's CC charges an international fee, and my sister told us not to exchange our dollars for pounds, and just to use her CC and pay her back for anything we wanted to buy. So, my mom used my sister's CC and it was agreed that she would pay her back (I was going to pay my mom back as soon as we got back to the states). \n\nThe last night of the trip my mom gave my sister the money for all of our shoes, and she declined it. My mom insisted and insisted, but my sister kept denying it, saying it was ok and she didn't want them to spend money.  \n\nEverything was great,  this was one of the best times we've had as a family.  When we're all together, it usually ends up in a huge fight, so this was a really special time for us.  \n\nWhen we get back to the states, I decide I'm going to get the film developed as soon as I got paid that Friday.  Also, I was planning on surprising her with the photo album (I know I said she doesn't like gifts that she didn;t ask for but this is sentimental so who wouldn't want that.)  \n\nA week later, my sister and I are facetiming just talking about random things.  Not even 1 second after we hang up she texts me, \"So are you getting me the boots or what.\"  I was taken aback because 1. why didnt you ask me about it while we're facetiming? Obviously it was on your mind.. but you couldn't say it to me.  2. Before the trip she kept denying the gift.  I called her back immediately after reading the text and my tone was not the happiest.  As sisters, we fight and give each other attitudes but its all good because thats how sisters communicate. She immediately went into defense mode and long story short, she said she spent sooo much money on the trip, we didn't pay for anything, and she even bought me and my mom shoes and didn't get her anything.  This just made me feel so upset.  I told her I was going to get her the boots but she said it was okay, so I was planning on doing something for her.  I told her it was tacky to be throwing all of this back into my face again. \n\nI understand she spend a lot of money on this trip. She didn't receive an x-mas gift from me or my mom, so I understand she could feel like she should get a gift.  I just don't understand why she can't put together the pieces that my mom and I did offer her a gift, but she kept denying it.  I didn't tell her about my surprise until that last heated argument.  Our conversation ended and I texted her I'll send her the money for her boots so she can buy them when its back in stock, so I sent her $200. Again, she said it was okay, and that she'd rather receive my surprise.  Honestly, I don't even want to look at those pictures right now.  I don't have any of those sentimental feelings anymore.  I told her it was okay and I'll just send the money.  I sent the money, and we haven't spoken since.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel bad, I know she spent a lot of money.  We're just two extremely different people.  She is wealthy. She can't understand my shortcomings with money in this point of my life, I'm working towards my future, so I have to be frugal.  I was still willing to buy her the boots because I wanted to.  So, what should I do? Should I reach out? I just wanted to vent. Thanks for reading.",

        "text": "I'll start out by saying that my dad is an emotionally immature, extremely manipulative narcissist. We've had a strained relationship for my entire life. I was raised by my paternal grandparents, and he would basically pick and choose when he wanted to be a \"parent.\" He would frequently make plans or promises and back out last minute, often times without communication, leaving me confused and waiting for him to show up. I could share a million painful memories, but only two are important for the sake of this post.\n\n1. When I graduated college, he was in the middle of giving me the silent treatment due to a miscommunicated disagreement. He did not call me on my birthday or speak to me on Thanksgiving. When my graduation date was approaching, I thought at the very least he would reach out with congratulations, but no. He did not show up to my graduation, he did not call or send a card, didn't even acknowledge I had graduated at all.\n\n2. When my husband and I got married, we had a very small church ceremony with only six of our closest family and friends. My dad showed up wearing jeans, did not wear his dentures, and frowned in every single one of our pictures. He made it very clear that he did not want to be there, lurking in the windows while we were outside taking pictures and checking his watch during the ceremony. At dinner, he refused to make a speech or say anything as father of the bride. We received \\*nothing\\* from him on our special day - not even a card. I later learned that he had a sour attitude because I did not go around and introduce him to our guests.\n\nAll this to say - his 60th birthday is next week. My family is having a birthday lunch for him. Is it petty or wrong if I don't buy him a birthday gift? It feels wrong celebrating when he didn't celebrate two of the biggest moments of my life. He couldn't even be bothered to pick up a $2 congratulations card on my wedding day, so why should I buy him a birthday card?",
