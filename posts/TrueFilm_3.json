        "text": "What's weird about it is that it can be super damn goofy as fuck like a 80s Peter Jackson movie while also being a genuinely emotional and heavy look at trauma, insanity and the homeless. It does have creepy stuff to it for sure that can ruin it for someone like Robert Williams' character (Parry) being a stalker and a bit of sexual harrasser and one moment where the main protagonist's wife pressures his husband into sex until he gets horny for her but idk, the kind of absolute messiness of the situation and emotions kinda just blends well with it, in my opinion. I kinds take it for example Lydia being okay with Parry's behavior because of her absolute loneliness and her feeling like somebody finally sees her struggles and frustrations and Parry's insanity and trauma getting in the way of behaving better in order to be in a romance with her. While it does not fully justify its problems, it does work for me as a way of engaging with the story and it does not remove the other ways the film can be so powerful\n\nI love it quite much. It had the emotional factor for me while also appealing to my more childish tastes of being over the top and being quite literally trashy. Robert Williams gives one of the best performances I've seen from him, if not, my favorite. He is pretty hilarious in this movie and when he needs to be awkward, cute and sad, he does it super well. The scene where he expresses his love for Lydia is genuinely a very emotional scene despite the creepy reveal of stalking. And there is the gay cabaret singer character who is pretty obviously gay and my God, he is fabulous as hell  and he is portrayed very well by Michael Jeter. He's almost at the level of the fun, campy appeal I get from Frank-N-Furter, who is an absolute queen and the scene where he congratulates Lydian for her award at the video store is pretty iconic and I was smiling the whole time watching it.\n\nIt is just my kind of film and probably my favorite so far by Terry Gilliam. Great bizarre characters, a surprisingly cute romance in parts, fun cinematography and a great story about trauma and redemption while also working as a social commentary of wealth inequality, the discrimination against the homeless and also, to an extent, a critique of homophobia.",

        "text": "So recently I got the chance to watch The Big Sleep for the second time, and I was reminded about how much I love it. The snappy dialogue, moody atmosphere, and the twisting plot all work together to create one of my favorite examples of film noir. As many of you know however, the plot is renowned for being one of the most confusing in all of cinema. I feel as though I have a decent grip on the plot (especially regarding the Mars, Rutledge, and Regan dynamic), but some of the answers still elude my understanding, and I figured that this would be a knowledgeable corner of the internet to turn to.\n\n1) How did Carmen (general Sturnwood's daughter) get mixed up with Joe Brody? I understand that General Sturnwood hired Sean Regan to get rid of or pay off Brody for some reason, but i'm a little confused on this dynamic.\n\n2) How did Carmen get mixed up with Geiger? Its my understanding that he was running the pornography distribution business and blackmailed Sturnwood for Carmen's gambling debts, but why would he know about Carmen's gambling debts if he was in the porn business? \n\n3) Why was Carmen even at Geiger's house at the night that he was murdered? She was obviously drugged so that they could take pictures of her and use that for blackmail, but why was she there in the first place? \n\n4) Lastly, why was Joe Brody there at Geiger's house? It's my understanding that Joe Brody was a gambler who was looking at taking over Geiger's business, but was he a part of the business already? Didn't Geiger already have Agnes and his driver/lover Lundgren as his assistants? \n\nAnyways, sorry for the long-winded post. I appreciate any help you can give!",

        "text": "Tell me if you've heard of this before:\n\nA Chinese American woman must travel back to Asia because of a wedding. Her Americanness clashes with the ways of the locals and this specifically causes a rift in the family. In the end, the protagonist must find a balance between both her American and Chinese identities.\n\nYou're probaby thinking 'oh that sounds like Crazy Rich Asians' and it is but it's also The Farewell. I've brought up this comparison before in another write up about Modern Orientalism that mostly focused on the then new Mulan live action remake. But after having had seen both Crazy Rich Asians and The Farewell again very  recently, the parallels exceedingly stood out to me. I find it very interesting how these two films tackle essentially the same subject but from two drastically different viewpoints arriving at two vastly different answers. Before we get into that, I wanna go over the  topic of gaze again. In my other post, I defined gaze as the  lens through which the author is assuming his audience is viewing his work. In the Western World, white gaze tends to be a phrase thrown around a bit whenever we talk about not only the amount of representation in media but also in how those identities are represented. A movie can be about Black, Asian, Latino or Indigenous societies but if the majority of the creative heads are white, it's going to be told from a white man's view and perception of that culture. A way around this is to let underrepresented communities in Western culture tell their own stories. If it's somehow impossible to find someone from that community to direct or write, form a story trust with people from said community to give their input. We've seen this done quite a bit with animated movies like Moana, Encanto, Soul and Coco. \n\nBut even if you can get an Asian director, writer, crew and cast put together, if you're aiming to release this to a Western presumably non-Asian audience then ostensibly you're going to conform your story in a way that makes sense to them. Your white/non-Asian audience is going to feel a sense of lockout if your movie, TV show, musical etc doesn't take into account their lack of knowledge here, right? Maybe, sometimes. As we've been  seeing recently with media being more globalized, a growing   \ncontingent of Americans want to engage with foreign cultures in an authentic way. I call it the 'Epcot Effect'. Americans want tofeel as if they're having a genuine cultural experience but at the  same time they want something that overall fits their perception of the culture they're engaging with. If there was a Colombian pavillion at Epcot, I'd imagine they'd pull mostly from traditional Colombian culture, like pre-1950's. You're not going to have dudes on every corner trying to sell you watches while a group of cumbia musicians serenade a couple eats street food as they wait for a bus. But by having a Latino writer, co-director,  composer and songwriter on your creative team, none of whom are actually Colombian, you can sell your new fantastical musical to gringos as a somewhat culturally accurate and authentic experience, albeit provided to you by a multinational media conglomerate. Studios see the value in creating content that appeal to diverse audiences and want to make the maximum amount of dollars as possible for every project. There's this juggling act of making sure the community represented is appeased but also that your white audience isn't alienated by something not feeling made for them.\n\nCrazy Rich Asians feels like the endgame of this type of thinking  and this is coming from someone who actually loves this movie. I've never done a full on review for this film but overall I think it's a solid 7/10. I definitely think it should've been nominated for  a few Oscars and I'm excited for the sequel. But the film does have some issues lend themselves to our discussion here. If you don't have any familiarity with Chinese culture outside of the takeout restaurant down the block, do not worry. This movie will explain everything. Why are we having this party? It's because this flower only blooms a certain time of year and our culture sees this as good luck. What's this food I'm eating? This is a traditional  Malay food that's common in the country. Why are we making these dumplings? What does this game represent? Why is anything happening in the plot at all? They will explain every goddamn thing. Every single cultural clash or exchange is broken down for the audience. I wouldn't even say it was done poorly. If you're just blindly  watching like I was then you're more caught up in the beautiful outfits, sexy shirtless men and beautiful locales than anything  else. But upon rewatching it a few times, it stood out to me how old fashioned the movie feels. Rachel is ultimately at odds with   \nthe viewpoints of the locals in Singapore, especially Nick's family. Her Americanness/modernity is what makes her stand out and puts her at odds with the more tradition minded Young family. \n\nWhat's weird about this dynamic is that the way the film portrays Singapore is this sort of fantastical urban paradise. When the film came out, I jokingly heard some Asians refer to this as their Black Panther. But in as much as that movie portrays a very  fantastical version of Africa, Crazy Rich Asians does the same with Asia. The film does explain that Singapore and China are two different countries, kinda. But you would be forgiven if you  though Singapore was a colony or territory of China. The focus is exclusively on the Chinese Singaporean characters. Darker skinned characters are only seen in service positions or portrayed with heavy shades of 'Scary Black Man'. Singapore is portrayed as a   \nlavish and indulgent country of excess that mimics the West but has an Eastern twist on it. They sing American style jazz music but in Mandarin. They have exotic over the top weddings with the bride walking down the aisle to Elvis. They strive to be on the Chinese version of Vogue. They flaunt their European brand clothing and jewelry constantly. The movie begins with them combating racism by buying out the hotel. They are shown to be close friends of the white British aristocracy. Hell half of them speak with British accents. Their culture looks like ours somewhat, but our American protagonist finds herself out of place in this world and her Americanness is what not only causes conflict but forces certain characters to change their viewpoints on things. At one point, the studio actually wanted to turn Rachel into a white girl and while  I'm very glad they didn't go through with that choice I can also see why they'd suggest that. \n\nCrazy Rich Asians feels like if someone saw La La Land and Joy Luck Club and wondered if there was a way to blend the two. I've never read the book it was based on but apparently the author pulled no punches in how he portrayed the upper class of Singapore. From what I understand, the book reads more like a satire whereas the film plays it straight. There's dance numbers that feel like something George Cukor would've come up with had he directed Flower Drum Song. There's this sort of classic Hollywood vibe to how decadent the world of the Young family is shown to be.  Critics picked up on this as well with Caroline Siede from The AV Club writing:\n\n\"Crazy Rich Asians isn’t a musical, but it feels like one. Frequent dance-movie director Jon M. Chu, who made a couple of the Step Up sequels, films the opulent world of Singaporean elite as if they might break out in song at any moment.  A zippy montage of social media gossip feels like a modern update on Bye Bye Birdie’s  “Telephone Hour.” Beauty And The Beast’s “Be Our Guest” could easily underscore any of the film’s many montages of delectable-looking Chinese cuisine. And there’s a wedding   \n sequence so elaborately staged you could place it wholesale into a Broadway show. Chu’s  film revels in the glamorous attire, kooky supporting characters, and elaborate parties that so often define the movie musical genre\"\n\nAnd:\n\n\"Chu films the world of Crazy Rich Asians as if it were a decadent dessert just waiting to be  eaten: From the gorgeous gowns Rachel wears to the aerial shots of Singapore’s stunning architecture to the elaborate party sequences that sometimes involve 1920s dance numbers and synchronized swimmers, Crazy Rich Asians feels like a Busby Berkeley number made of colorful fondant and served alongside a Singapore ice kachang\"\n\nCrazy Rich Asians presents a version of Asia that appeals to an Orientalist sensibility. Singapore is presented as this hyper-decadent old fashioned exotic land where people live in futuristic cities yet still arrange marriages for their children like it's the late 1800's. It is Rachel with her American sensibilities that teach this cast of outlandish and silly characters how to truly come into the 21st century. She is the one who confronts Eleanor on her outdated ways concerning relationships. She is the one who dares step out of place to question why things are the way they are. Her Americanness is seen as what makes her  different from the other girls Nick could be with. She's outspoken, direct and is forward thinking. There is not a lot of daylight between what this film is doing and something like The King &amp; I. Even when the film does engage with Chinese culture it does so in a way that feels nostaglic with jazzy standards sung in Mandarin and Cantonese.  Jocelle Koh for AsianPopWeekly picked up on this too:\n\n\"The song choices were all a little lacklustre for my taste, drawing mainly from classics from the 1920-1960s which although may add that grandeur and glamour to the film,  also reek a tinge of orientalism at play. It perpetuates stereotypes of a musical landscape stuck in time; classic and elegant but gently crumbling round the edges. It seems to me that for  the most part, the film just headed straight for the safe classics rather than really trying to reinvent perceptions of the Asian diasporic experience sonically, showing an inherent lack of  understanding of how musical offerings on both sides contribute to meaningful cultural dialogues\"\n\n\"I craved more instances which represented a willingness to open channels of communication between Eastern and Western cultures, rather than just thinly packaged Western goods with a marketable Eastern sheen\"\n\nThis coating of Western goods with an Eastern packaging also extends to how the film was cast according to how some critics and audience members responded. There was a lot of talk about how so many actors with European ancestry were cast as supposedly wholly ethnic Chinese Singaporeans. This critcism focused largely around Henry Golding's casting. Henry is mixed with Iban and English and while to me he presents as Asian, he doesn't really pass as someone ethnically Chinese. Many felt as if his casting was a result  of whitewashing. This topic is incredibly complicated and rooted in Hollywood's long history of yellowface, whitewashing and Asian erasure yet cultural commodification. I'm not Asian so I can't tell anyone how to  feel about this. But this speak of Hollywood's tendency to seek out versions of different groups that  conform to European beauty standards. Light skinned and biracial Black women have often had an easier, but by no means smooth, time in getting roles compared to their darker skinned counterparts. Golding's casting wasn't the only point of contention when the film came out. A few actresses who auditioned for the film were told that couldn't be cast as ethnically Chinese or weren't Asian enough. Then there's the fact that again almost no almost other ethnic groups are portrayed besides Chinese Singaporeans. I have a friend who lived in Singapore and I asked him about his experience while he lived there, he's originally from Malayasia. He told me this:\n\n\"Most of my friends were a mix of Malay, Chinese and Indian. Even if you were as rich as Nick and his family was, you'd have at least one Indian friend who went to some of the same prep schools as you. The younger ones would definitely have artsy friends who are Malay or Indian. Especially Indian because if they're this rich then they've definitely at least met Indians from India who are just as rich\"\n\nAs I've mentioned before, the film comes to the conclusion that Eleanor was wrong for how she treated Rachel. Rachel is willing to let go of Nick not out of some cultural obligation but solely due to her personal devotion to his happiness. Eleanor is the one who must grow and change. She is the one who learns. Rachel gets what she wants in the end because of her selflessness and moral virtue. She is the one who teaches the ignorant foreigner the follies of their way of thinking. And it's all presented this almost fairy tale like hyper stylized way that would have Baz Luhrmann weeping with pride. It's a candy coated, vibrant and luxurious dreamscape that gives Asian Americans the representation they've been craving while presenting non-Asian viewers with a highly exotified and fantastical version of the East. As much as I love this film, I do wish there were more moments when the characters and the themes they represent were allowed to breathe. Astrid gets the thinnest of B-plots that from what I understand contained a lot more class commentary in the book. You ain't getting a shred of that shit in this movie so I can see why it was removed. But they could've done \\*something\\* more than just have her act out the Asian version of 70 percent of Lifetime's original content. For as traditional as Singapore is portrayed in regard to gender roles and class, you'd think the film would've spent more time with Oliver. How does a gay man navigate a world like this? How does someone like Pek Lin who clearly doesn't conform to gender roles cope in this kind of place? These are the characters that spend the most time with Rachel besides Nick and their characters largely exist as soy sauced archtypes we're used to in the West. \n\nWhen I watched The Farewell while I didn't think it was most original thing I've ever seen in my life, I appreciate how I wasn't viscerally reminded of the films influences. Billi's struggle is almost the same as Rachel's in that her Americanness puts her at odds with the cultural mores of the Chinese locals. Where this film differs is that Billi doesn't end the film still entrenched in her American way of thinking. She instead sees the value of upholding her family's traditions because she's reconnected with a side of herself she thought she lost. Billi processes what she had to give up in order to immigrate. As she unpacks this, she rediscovers her love for her ancestral culture and a newfound appreciation for her family. While she keeps the lie, the movie doesn't frame this from a 'East v West' type of morality. Doing so does cause her internal turmoil and she doesn't come to this decision easily. The answer The Farewell comes to by the end of it's runtime is not at all clear cut. Life is complicated, families are complicated. Sometimes you go along with things you dislike to protect the ones you love. That doesn't make it right or wrong, but it's what we do to get through the day. The Farewell doesn't end on a definitive note. Billi has been forever changed by her experience back home and she's kept a little piece of it with her as we  see by her 'ha'ing at the sky like Nai Nai.\n\nA big difference between The Farewell and Crazy Rich Asians is how they portray Chinese culture. I'm going to say Chinese for the sake of simplicity because Crazy Rich Asians is entirely concerned with ethnic Chinese Singaporeans and doesn't make much of a distinction either way. Anyway, my favorite scene in The Farewell is the scene where the family is talking about the differences between Chinese and American life while eating at the rotating buffet. While the characters are openly talking about cultural differences, there is not much of an explanation of culture in the same way Crazy Rich Asians does it. It feels natural that they'd be having this conversation and it doesn't grind the film to screeching halt. But what I like even more is that there is zero explanation of what they're eating. They switch back between Chinese, Japanese and English depending on who they're talking to while going   \nabout their dinner. Billi's dad never says 'oh we eat this because of this cultural reason'. It's also a clever way of keeping your scene visually interesting when it's basically ten minutes of people just sitting and talking. This isn't to say that there isn't some sort of explanation at all but it's done in a way that feels a bit more natural. The crux of the plot hinges on whether or not Billi will keep the same lie everyone else in the family is from Nai Nai. This is one of the few times the film explains the cultural significance of something instead of just leaving it up to interpetation. There's a similar moment in the graveyard with the fake mourners. But otherwise, the film in very entrenched in Chinese culture yet doesn't hold our hand through it. In a way, our journey as an audience mirrors Billi's journey as she is being thrown back into this world she's been removed from. She's not given much context to what she's experiencing and has to stumble her way through it and relearn what was forgotten .It's a subtle choice but it's an effective one. As the movie progresses so does our familiarity with what we are being exposed to. My second favorite scene in the film is when the family is doing that weird chicken thing around the table. Again our experience mirrors that of Billi's. At first there is confusion then there is the attempt to learn and finally we are in full thrust with it all. When Billi is leaving China and Awkwafina is giving us her third Oscar clip of the film, her heartbreak is that of our own. I watched it the first time when I was visiting my mom in Jersey for the first time in years. My feeling about leaving my family was very similar to Billi's so  by the end of the film I was full on sobbing.\n\nThe Farewell doesn't force Billi to make the decision to be Asian or Asian American. Instead it analyzes the life of a woman who has already made that choice and what doing so has done to her. I think that's the main difference between this film and Crazy Rich Asians. They're essentially telling the same story in a lot of ways but whereas Billi ends up having to reckon with her identity at some point, Rachel never does. It's funny because if you strip away a lot of the glitz and sheen from Crazy Rich Asians thematically it's trying to communicate this a very similar message to The Farewell but visually it's like An American in Paris or Gigi. The Farewell gives Billi the space to actually work through her issues in a way Rachel is never allowed. The closest thing we get is when she's alone with her mom. This would've been the place for Rachel to walk through what it means to her to be both Chinese and American and what she feels like she gained or lost with this. Billi's monologue where she's crying to her mom is the same moment of cartharsis and revelation Rachel should've had at some point. There's also something else I like about this scene: Billi actually tells her mother that she brought the family to the USA and Billi felt entirely in the dark about what was going on and that in a way has scarred her. It's clear that this has led to a bit of a distance between Billi and her parents over the years. It's not a one to one comparison, but I do wish there was a moment like this between Rachel and Nick. He gets off basically scot free for not basically thrusting his girlfriend into this insane world and not preparing her for any of this shit. \n\nThe reception to Crazy Rich Asians and The Farewell in China is interesting to analyze. Usually these days when an American studio creates a film about a non-white culture, the response from the people of said culture is that of appreciation and respect. Mexicans loved Coco. Colombians have embraced Encanto. Africans were hype for both Black Panther films. This was not the response that the Chinese gave Crazy Rich Asians. If Asian Americans were silently weeping at seeing themselves represented for the first time, the Chinese were not impressed. I've read  a lot of reviews on Chinese film message boards and they were not with the shit's at fucking all. I wish I could share every single review because there is some gold here. But to sum up what the main criticisms are, many took issue with the extreme amounts of materialism in the film. For context, in many Asian cultures the concept of flaunting wealth is seen as uncouth and unbecoming. The overwhelming decadence of Crazy Rich Asians didn't sit well with a lot of Chinese viewers. It was as if the West was showing them out they truly viewed Chinese people: stuck in their ways, foolishly extravagant and needing of Western influence to bring them in the modern era. They also took issue with the casting with Henry Golding again singled out. His foreign accent when speaking Mandarin alienated some viewers. Ironically though it might've been that the film was as groundbreaking in the West that it flopped in  China. To quote Chinese film industry analyst Johnathan Papish:\n\n\"Mainland audiences prefer their ‘Chinese’ stories to come from China and their Hollywood stories to come from Hollywood; they walk away when the lines are blurred\"\n\nHu Shan, a Beijing based performing artist, had a similar line of thought:\n\n\"The novelty of Crazy Rich Asians only works for Western people who don’t know much about Asian culture and are fascinated by how ‘crazy rich’ Asians can be … and the Asian diaspora, who are mostly happy just to see their own culture presented in a Hollywood movie. For the Chinese, both of these points aren’t relevant. The love story itself isn’t even touching because it’s too distant from their own lives\"\n\nCrazy Rich Asians made about 1.5 million dollars in China but The Farewell fared much worse and only made 580k in China. But the reasons why The Farewell flopped are very different from why Crazy Rich Asians did. To some audiences, the story felt too Chinese to feel like an American product yet also didn't feel quite Chinese enough. The immigrant experience doesn't really translate to that audience. It was decently received by the audiences who did see it. It got a 7.3 out of 10 on Douban, their version of Letterbox, and 8.4 out of 10 on Maoyan, their version of Metacritic. For comparison, Crazy Rich Asians has a 6 on Douban and Maoyan didn't even bother giving it a rating. Some audiences who saw The Farewell liked how much it did resemble the people they know and their own family dynamics. However it was so authentic that a lot of people were ambivalent. It was so familiar that it didn't stand out from their own films. What is novel in the United States, is old hat in China. The overall reaction seemed to be that this way better than Crazy Rich Asians but it still didn't hit the mark for Chinese audiences. To be fair, most American made movies about China don't do well in China unless your name is Kung Fu Panda.\n\n2018 feels like a lifetime away here in 2023 and we've seen the landscape change a lot. We are seeing more Asian and Asian American films break through and become mainstream. Turning Red, Minari, Everything Everywhere All at Once, Drive My Car, RRR, Shang Chi and shows like Ms. Marvel, Squid Game, Pachinko and Mr. Sunshine have seen success in the  last few years. Parasite became the first foreign language film to win Best Picture at the Oscars. Asian led projects are coming out with more frequency and are finding their audiences. There have been some misses like Raya and the Last Dragon. But we are seeing progress in how Asian cultures are being portrayed. Crazy Rich Asians definitely kicked off something and we're still seeing the results of it. But as much as I like the film, I think by the time we get to it's ten year anniversary we might look on it as a bit dated. It was definitely a step forward right in the right direction but as we've been seeing lately, we can do better.",

        "text": "This is definitely one of the more underrated works of Wong Kar Wai. I think anyone (and this mostly everyone) who falls in love with Chungking Express and In Mood for Love has to go visit this one. Despite being 5 &amp; 10 years earlier than the mentioned films, it represents a sort of intersection in both types of filmmaking. It has some linear style placed throughout its fragmented structure. It is strong on use of Visual Style (colors, expressive camera, and other effects). The camera work is nowhere as stylish as we later see in Fallen Angels, or Chungking. Still, it feels like a beginning point of the experiment which led to the personal style we see in those two films. \n\nDespite the usual dreamlike atmosphere of Wong Kar Wai's films, it does present an intensity and depth of emotion that affects the viewer in a manner intended to last. The dialogue (despite the problems of translation) is absolutely remarkable. \n\nYuddy's (Leslie Cheung) initial declaration to Maggie Cheung's character that - \"This day April 16, 1960, 2:59:00, I will remember this minute for all of my life because I spent it with you.\" Each character portrait is personal and independent in its own way. (However, I found it more so with the male characters.) The writing stays quite impressive with a fall here and there, but still very much a standard especially considering that Wong Kar Wai is not one for the writing process and script rehearsals. \n\nOne of the discussions around WKW's films is about the nature of the plot (or the lack of it). WKW said that for him there is a plot. I have felt that especially due to his background in Graphic Design and Media, Colors are very huge part of the storytelling for him. It isn't simply a matter of lighting and warmth/cold. \n\nThe multiple storylines meeting and separating throughout the films is a feature that is done really well. We have each character with a story and life of their own. In WKW's films, the temporal and spatial aspects are not definite, they may intermix into each other to create a narrative like one creates a painting.",

        "text": "A recent example is definitely the film, Close-Up (1990) by Abbas Kiarostami. I really, really related to the film because of the fact that it is a story about this guy who loves finding meaning about how he feels in his life and art to him, is also a way to bringing awareness to much greater societal issues going on around him. And he also desires to be himself someone to tell his own story based on those feelings and beliefs but due to lack of money and abilities, he cannot really reach that desire of his and can only admire those who do art that is so beautiful and personal to him. And I personally have gone through those kinds of feelings. Not just with movies but also with my desire to be a rapper and talk about my own emotions and also my identity as a person of color and of the LGBTQ+ community. It's a film that while I think it's personally well-directed, the thing that really got me was its story and how it feels so real to my own experiences.\n\nShiki-Jitsu (2000) by Hideaki Anno is also like my second favorite movie of all time. While not exclusively a favorite for just how personal it is to me cause I think that for example, the characters are compelling, the cinematography is goddamn gorgeous and has an amazing score, it does tell the kind of story that I feel I go through regularly. The thought of everyday just wanting to go somewhere else where I am not bothered from the hardships of my adulthood, the codependency for someone and just feeling depressed and like my actions have no coherent reasons to their occurrences. It is a film that just captures perfectly that sense of loneliness and that temporary glimpses to absolute happiness and then to desperation and sadness. And thinking about it now, the film does also show what it means to be someone with bipolar disorder, which I have myself.",

        "text": "**Blurry Background (Shallow DOF)**  \nThe former, I assume, is a film-makers' technical and/or artistic choice, and for the purpose of showcasing the foreground by having the background out of focus (known as a shallow DOF -- depth of field, created with the aperture of the lens). The only real reason I could understand for this is to better blend background and foreground camera work and locations, and animation (though I don't actually know if this is needed). Regardless: I don't care. I hate blurry backgrounds, more so on clear, crisp HD playback (such as 1080p Blu-rays). I want the entire field to be equally focused (foreground and background, and subject). Am I the only one?\n\nI just saw my copy of *Transformers: Age of Extinction (2014)*, and most of the movie has an extremely blurry background with an extremely clear, crisp foreground (but, mostly, just the subject). I read that this movie was shot on both film and digital, so maybe this decision was to better blend all camera work. I have no idea.\n\nCompare to *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007)* or really any of the HP movies, which is almost perfectly focused throughout the field (deep DOF). I like this much more. First, I have no problem keeping my gaze on the subject. Second, it offers much more detail, throughout (by definition). Third, it's mostly more realistic, since the human eye doesn't actually really blur background like Transformers does. Fourth, it looks more pleasing to my eye, more so when we're trying to view the clearest, highest quality picture -- it's *all* crisp and uniform.\n\nNote: There are certain scenes which work well with extreme shallow DOF, for storytelling purposes through film-making techniques. This is typically when we are to hyper-focus on a subject, or else looking at the world through their eyes, and they only see a given subject (if not in reality, at least from an emotionality or psychological valence standpoint). This, I have little issue with, though personally prefer an entirely perfect movie (this likely speaks more to personality and subjective taste than anything else). The key point being that I don't actually have a *problem* with this sort of shallow DOF usage when done right. Lest we forget, some movies go over the top with this, which proves counterproductive to what they are trying to achieve, at least for me. Two clear examples would be The *Commuter (2018)* and *The Conjuring 2 (2016)*. If I can recall, these two use shallow DOF to properly align the viewer with the MC \\[main character\\] in terms of the great negative emotion they are feeling (though there are certain cases where this can be used for positive emotion, it's much rarer). The other, fairly popular way is within comedy to some end, such as *Blended (2014)*. I do have a problem with the entire movie being shallow DOF, though.  \n\n\n  \n**Film Grain**  \nThe latter might be a little more complex and interesting, though I personally hate film grain under 90% of circumstances. Even if I lose some detail with the DNR due to the original film stock being low-quality, I would rather have a clear image than a full-detailed grainy image. But, in many cases, this is not actually needed, because the grain is reasonable, such as with *Saw (2004)*, though I have heard 4k viewers complain that there is much grain on the 4k version. I found the 1080p Blu-ray version to be slightly better than DVD, and more than watchable, regardless of some grain issues.\n\n*Saw (2004)* is actually a good place to start, because it brings up another key point: taste. I noticed a certain creepiness was covering the DVD cut, with the lower-quality and graininess. Maybe James built the film around the graininess, or maybe it was accidential. Nonetheless, I did feel Saw (2004) worked a bit better in the lowest possible picture quality, for two reasons: first, it hides any issues in-camera (namely, around the cutting scenes, which are very unrealistic, though much of this is hidden with editing/transitions), and second, it makes it feel more documentary and somehow more real. Maybe that's just my experience.\n\nAnyway, in most cases, beyond this and a few others *-*\\- such as actually wanting that sort of old or washed-out look -- I hate grain. I hate grain when it's added back in (such as with those semi-early American digital movies circa 2010-2012), and I hate it when it's from the film stock. I don't think it looks good, I find it distracting, I don't think it adds anything artistically, emotionally, or technically, and it is objectively less detailed than had you high-quality stock with stock, or slow film (or not added any in post-, if digital). A movie should either be old, or it should be perfectly clean. One thing I seriously don't agree with is adding grain back into digital film. That just makes no sense, unless we are to make all movies have the classic 'cinema look' of 1970 for all eternity, in which case, you should just use high-quality 35mm film! The great purpose of digital is that it can be perfect and ideal for CGI (of course, it's now faster and cheaper, I believe (but not all film-makers and actors agree on shooting within the fast digital environment, though this is seriously off-topic now)).\n\nThoughts?",

        "text": "Demolition Man (1993) is one of the most epic classic science fiction/action film of all time! Has it all, explosions, practical effects, one liners, 80s songfests, soundtracks! \n\nJohn Spartan (Sylvester Stallone) is a reckless Los Angeles policeman, known as the \"demolition man\" for the destruction he routinely engenders while apprehending big baddies. After a particularly ruthless criminal, Simon Phoenix (Wesley Snipes), sets him up by making it appear that Spartan wantonly caused the deaths of a bus load of hostages, Spartan is sentenced to 60 years in prison. \n\nThe film begins in a not-too-distant future of 1996. Prisons are a lot different than what we're used to, and there's a new policy of cryogenically freezing inmates. Flash forward to 2032. Simon Phoenix is up for an obligatory parole hearing, when he escapes. The film's 21st Century society is much different than what we see in today's day and age (worsening cultural chaos, exacerbated by a huge earthquake, precipitated the change), and the \"San Angeles\" police cannot capture Phoenix or keep him in check. The decision is made to revive Spartan, reasoning that an out of control but effective cop mired in the ways of the late 20th Century may be the only one who can capture the out of control criminal. \n\nDemolition Man is peak Stallone. He's at his beefy best, performing a ballet of virtuosity. And the acting is not bad at all. This was the first of three meetings between Stallone and Wesley Snipes and boy is it a zinger. The chemistry between the two is electric, just flowing off the screen like lava. The screenplay is quite tongue in cheek, it knows that there is too much cheez spread across this pizza pie, but does it cringe in shame? No!!! It embraces it whole-heartedly, suspending any skepticism about its \"aboutness\"....\n\nTalking of Snipes. Stallone insisted that Snipes and only Snipes play the role of Simon Phoenix. There was some grumbling at the time the movie came out that some of his fight sequences seemed a bit telegraphed. This is because Snipes was so fast at swinging punches and kicks he needed to slow it down for the camera to pick up his sweet moves. Snipes also insisted on doing his own stunts which some, at least according to Denis Leary, had to be secretly reshot with a stuntman at night.\n\nI wasn't aware of this, but the film has a healthy 5.7 on IMDB, that's not bad. Yes, we can stand around and poke fun at ol' \"sly\" but I bet any one of us would have been more than happy to be him on that movie set, at the height of our careers, not a care in the world other than making entertaining movies that people want to see.",

        "text": "Obviously style is an important part of making a film but can it be its own justification and exist independently as the driving force of the film? Recently I see more and more films where style is not there to support narrative but the other way around. In films like this plot is secondary and I would dare say even inconsequential and a film is just a canvas for an author to showcase their visual style. Although a film can have some great mise-en-scene, cinematography, editing in my opinion this approach puts a certain ceiling on how impactful a film can be. I can respect the showcase of cinematic techniques but if it's just for essentially \"showing off\" with no purpose in shaping narrative it feels aimless and reminds me more of a film school exercise than a real film.\n\nSolid argument against style's dependence on narrative is \"parametric\" narration. David Bordwell coined the term inspired by Noël Burch who called film techniques - parameters. It's basically style centered narration where style doesn't necessarily follow the conventions of syuzhet construction. Stylistic patterns are usually (in classical narration, art cinema narration and Soviet historical-materialist narration) a vehicle to help the process of constructing fabula out of syuzhet by reinforcing causal, temporal and spatial \"connective tissues\". Parametric narration creates stylistic patterns distinct from the demands of syuzhet construction which makes style at least equally or even more important than syuzhet patterns. The frequent example would be repetition of stylistic elements over and over again throughout the film with slight modifications so the plot patterning is intentionally predictable in order to make noticing variations easier. Bordwell names \"Last Year at Marienbad\" (1961) and \"Méditerranée\" (1963) as two landmarks in the cinema of parametric narration.\n\nAlthough this is a good argument for the coexistence of plot construction and style that doesn't play a role in supporting it, style in this case also serves a purpose in overall film form, only through the back door. It still isn't its own justification and end goal. It still tries to tell. It is at least indirectly dependent and tied to overall film form.",

The story of a man wanting to express his own feelings and thoughts about society and wanting to do art but not having the ability to is one that talks to me deeply and I love it. And I find myself crying everytime he opens up more about himself and shows regrets for lying to the family and wanting to get their admiration through the disguise of a much more famous man. I also think it has does have important social commentary in that the man loves art but doesn't have the money to really make a film or even for himself and also lies to the family for some financial support while at the same time wanting to express his passion for film and art in general.\n\nIdk, I just fee the film captures perfectly how I deeply value art as how it relates to my personal life and what should be said about the world. It's beautiful.\n\nAlso, it has one of my favorite final shots ever in a film. The face of the protagonist with the flowers is just a perfect expression of both the beauty of art and also hope that this man will be better after this and maybe move somewhere a little bit better than where he was. I know I sound annoying and preachy with this but it really has captured my heart and I was smiling inside watching it.\n\nThe title for this film is perfect for describing what this film is about. In the way how cinematic close-ups helps us feel more personally engaged with the characters we are watching going through their stories rather than isolate yourself from them with long shots, we get to see a little closer into the life of this man to further connect with him rather than just watching him from a distance and from the voices of the people interpreting his actions and beliefs as outsiders. The close-up creates empathy and this is what it is all about. To empathize with the poor. To empathize with the passion for art. To empathize as a value in life itself. Art is after all, a form of communication that requires us to empathize to an extent with the feelings expressed in the images.\n\nSuch a beautiful film.",

        "text": "The movie is a legal thriller starring Richard Gear as an attorney defending his client, the very young Edward Norton, in a case of brutal murder of a Chicago bishop. The movie is very tense, it goes beyond the courtroom itself and into a branching investigation that goes over multiple facets of human vices. In parallel , Richard Gear's romantic interest, play by Laura Linney, faces him in court as the procurer in charge of giving Norton's a maximum sentence.\n\nI've been recommended this movie by YouTube and I thought I would give it a try. It's actually pretty good, but there's also something a bit quirky about it. Not every scene is perfect, not every lined delivered like you'd expect. It's and oddball, or maybe it just aged in a way that makes it over-dramatic for the modern audience. It stays interesting to watch though. \n\n(spoilers ahead)\n\nSo many plot points in this movie have been over-exploited tropes that there is something gauche in the curve of that story. The multiple dissociative disorders, the sexual abuse from clergy members, the badass penal attorney and his mobster support, and pretty much all the characters in the judiciary and political system, etc.. Everything jumps at your face in a way that transcends your regular 90s fiction and is more akin to the 2020s production. It's almost a self-aware movie, despite being set in the very typical for the time court room. The 4th wall barely holds under some of the awkward lines (\"the usual, Stu\" while asking for a drink almost killed me). The main female protagonist (who says that line) displays a rare aggressiveness that place the movie at the border of misogyny. I can't think of any movie that gives a central woman so little softness. Yet the movie is one of the most relevant that I can think of, maybe because you can never tell if it's great or if it's terrible. \n\nAnyone else saw it recently? What are your thoughts?",

For a fully illustrated version please click here - https://filmofileshideout.com/archives/alan-gadneys-pointless-film-moonchild/\n\nIf you like good acting, I suggest you stop reading this article and forget you ever heard the name Moonchild. This odd, little movie stars both John Carradine and Victor Buono. You remember Mr. Buono, he played King Tut in the Batman TV show and a hundred other minor roles throughout the mid-twentieth century. Both Buono and Carradine have a grandiose, faux-aristocratic style of acting that makes you want to shake them until their neck snaps. Regardless, the two men have starred in enough schlock to fill an extra-large dumpster.\n\nMoonchild falls into the “creepy castle” movie genre. It’s a tried and true and tired old method of churning out films on the cheap. A producer gets a deal on renting a European castle somewhere, and then flies the cast out for a weekend shoot. Such films always consist of the same ingredients: blood, boobs, and either vampires or Satan worshippers. Oh, and there is very often a hunchback or Igor character. In Moonchild, the hunchback is named Homunculus. He is not only named Homunculus, he is also referred to as a homunculus, which he is not. I don’t think the writer knew what a homunculus was.\n\nIt’s likely the whole creepy castle genre was born out of James Whale's 1932 film The Old Dark House. You might say The Old Dark House was a homunculus. What James Whale didn’t have was the Gregorian funk soundtrack. The soundtrack for Moonchild sounds like Bootsy Collins wandered into a monastery in 13th century Flanders. I suppose the monks would have been a bit surprised when a 6 foot 2 black man (not counting the 8-inch platform shoes) dressed in a glitter suit, top hat, and starburst sunglasses, sauntered through their arches, but once the monks stopped panicking and started singing along with whatever Bootsy was layin’ down, it might have sounded like the Moonchild theme song and soundtrack.\n\nMoonchild is billed as a horror movie, which it most certainly is not, unless you count the horror of realizing you have spent money to see it. There are no monsters, or slashers, or ghosts. There are no Satanists or space aliens, just never-ending arguments between a king and a priest. Writer and director Alan Gadney seems to have had higher aspirations than making a straightforward grindhouse money-grab. By all appearances, he believed he was making a deeply philosophical movie about the eternal conflict between Church and State.\n\nIn place of a plot and/or character-driven drama, what Moonchild provides is a series of overblown soliloquies about the freedom of man. Most of them sound about as deep as a Captain Kirk diatribe, but not as well written, if you can imagine that. Actually, Shatner would have fit right into Moonchild. He could have spouted overblown platitudes right alongside the others.  \n\nThe premise of the film is that in this creepy, old castle, there is a never-ending conflict between a pompous priest (Buono) who wishes to conduct an inquisition and a king who challenges the inquisitor’s judgment. This clash has been played and replayed for centuries. Any time a young man visits the castle, he is drawn into a phantasm where he must play the role of the sinner, while the king and the priest fight over his fate. \n\nThe film shows us an unnamed college student’s journey through the madness. I assume that Gandey thought he could provide some insight into the current relationship between church and state by replaying the inquisition. He clumsily tries to bridge the time gap with scenes that involve the college student arguing with the enthroned inquisitor and asking with indignation, “Am I not innocent until proven guilty?!” At which point I yelled at the screen, “No, you idiot! This is the inquisition!” I guess no one expects the Inquisition. \n\nMoonchild does not have the obligatory boobs (good name for a punk band). The pretty, blonde ingenue is spared having to bare her bosom, but lest we fail the patriarchy, she has no lines at all in the film. She makes sad eyes and loving eyes and inquisitive eyes at the men running around her, but apparently what she has to say is irrelevant. Of course, if we truly are talking about the Catholic Church, that would be a fair assessment of their attitude toward the female of the species.\n\nThe film is completely pointless. If Gandey had something to say about the relationship between Church and State, hiring Buonno to defend the inquisition doesn’t shed light on much, but Gandy may have had a different motive. The film is bookended by a quote from Edgar Cayce, “the sleeping prophet.” If you are not familiar with Cayce’s work, here is a brief excerpt from his Wikipedia page: “Edgar Cayce (/ˈkeɪsiː/; 18 March 1877 – 3 January 1945) was an American clairvoyant who claimed to channel his higher self while asleep in a trance-like state. His words were recorded by his friend Al Layne, his wife, Gertrude Evans, and later by his secretary, Gladys Davis Turner. During the sessions, Cayce would answer questions on a variety of subjects like healing, reincarnation, dreams, the afterlife, past lives, nutrition, Atlantis, and future events. As a devout Christian and Sunday school teacher, Cayce's readings were often criticized as demonic by his religious colleagues.”\n\nGandalf or Gandy or whatever his stupid name is, decided to use the following quote, “Yyou may not even have to come back at all if you become perfectly developed in this life.” I’m not sure if that qualifies as “actionable advice”, but there you have it. It’s as insightful as anything else said in the film.\n\nGandy originally made this film for his master'ss thesis at the University of Southern California. It was released in 1974 and flopped. He made one other film during the same period called West Texas, but that didn’t do so well either. As far as I can tell, that was the end of his career in film.",

I disagree with that because he's already won 2 Golden Globes for The Fabelmans and he came up close to win his 4th DGA against the Daniels. Another reason why I disagree with this is because I don't think being in his late 70s has anything to do with that. And while most of his recent films have been a hit or miss, he still has been able to make films that've been pretty groundbreaking in my opinion like Lincoln, West Side Story, and The Fabelmans. \n\nI do believe he'll make more films that are very creative and groundbreaking that will be enough to win his 4th DGA award and a 3rd Oscar win for Best Director (and maybe Picture) someday in the future. Not to mention maybe earned himself another BAFTA nomination for Best Directing.  The \"Spielberg is taken for granted\" is common opinion I've been hearing from some movie lovers on Reddit.

Everything that i searched for leads up to tops of movies with the most sex scenes and i dont mean that. \nProbably there is an indie movie or maybe another scorsesse movie that leads the ranking. \nIf anyone know,  thanks!",

        "text": "I'm just some guy but the first time I remember seeing a drone shot in a movie was in Werner Herzog's documentary **Cave of Forgotten Dreams**(2010). In that movie there's what appears to be a handheld first person camera shot of someone walking down an aisle between two rows of grape vines in a vineyard near the Chauvet Cave in France when suddenly the camera ascends off the ground and swoops over the trees to reveal the Ardèche river gorge. As it was happening I realized how they did it and it blew my fucking mind.\n\nSince then drone shots have really entered the visual lexicon. In the last five years I feel like I've seen just a whole bunch of overhead tracking shots following cars being driven down lonely roads by detectives and rising shots of medium density city neighborhoods accompanied by text establishing that we are now in Philadelphia or Boston or LA. They've become a relatively cheep way to add some instant production value which is good and worth while but also a little pat.\n\nThen '22 felt like the year of the sick drone shot.\n\n**Ambulance**(2022) is a really fun movie that is built off of a series of breath taking drone shots. I've never really been a fan of Michael Bay's movies --I've just never been able to silence my nagging suspicion that the only thing keeping him from becoming Leni Riefenstahl is a lack of opportunity-- but Ambulance is him at his absolute stylistic best. The movie does this thing a couple times where the camera rockets up to the top of a skyscraper then flips around and dives down the side only to pull out and find our eponymous ambulance tearing down the freeway. I've never seen anything like it. The drone shots take a story that could be a contained thriller like **The Taking of Pelham One Two Three**(1974) and blows it out into a maximalist roller coaster ride.\n\n**EO**(2022) is the empathetic story of a donkey's journey through contemporary Poland and a series of threads that spin off from there. In one section you assume the perspective of a bird and you get these swooping red filter drone shots of the country side then a massive wind turbine appears in the distance and the frame locks on the rotation of the blades, spinning the earth around the edge of the screen in a hypnotic way. Like with Ambulance it was something I've never seen before in a movie.\n\nAnyways, between those two movies and this art installation I saw that used a lurching drone shot of a woman out on the water in a rowboat to accentuate the sense of being in swells in a small craft I just felt like I kept getting knocked out last year by inventive uses of drones and I wondered if anyone else noticed the same thing or had any other examples. \nCan anyone think of an earlier example than Cave of Forgotten Dreams of obviously drone footage showing up in a commercial film? \nAre there any precursors to the wild drone shots we saw in 22' that I might have missed?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/118spvj/how_did_the_usual_suspects_really_end/",
        "text": "To fully understand the ending, let's recall the events of the movie! It starts with a man called Kaiser Söze gunning down an injured man by the name of Keaton, before setting the ship in which the dialogue is occurring on fire. The whole following timeline of the movie is focused on unraveling the backstory that resulted in this particular scene, and on establishing Kaiser's true identity.\n\nAs we can learn from the later scenes, 27 bodies were found on the pier after the explosion. There are only two people who survived - a severely burned Hungarian immigrant who regains consciousness slowly in a hospital, and a semi-paralyzed con man called Verbal, who is under interrogation by agent Kujan. Upon the instructions of the district attorney, Verbal will be let go in return for assisting in the investigation. The bulk of the film consists of Verbal's memories, presented in flashbacks.\n\nVerbal recounts that he was invited once to the police precinct as an extra in a line-up. Another four extras with felony records, who were involved in the line-up in addition to him, were kept overnight in the same cell. There, they devised a plan to commit a robbery. Dean Keaton, an ex-cop once convicted of \"dirty deals\" and now struggling to establish a legitimate business, plays the informal head of the crew.\n\nShortly thereafter, a lawyer named Kobayashi shows up, asking the crew to blow up a ship loaded with coke. Kobayashi blackmails all the crew members by giving them a detailed dossier on themselves and their relatives, and threatens severe retribution at the hands of his boss, the legendary Turkish gangster Kaiser Söze. At various times, all five have crossed Kaiser's path by sabotaging small operations, and now they are in debt.\n\nThe night of the raid comes. The three accomplices head for the ship, and Verbal is left as a \"lookout.\" One of the raiders is shot dead near the car with the cash, another is knifed in the back, and Keaton is shot by someone from the top deck. The cripple becomes an unwitting witness to Keaton's assassination scene, with which the movie started.\n\nAs it turns out, the dope was just a front, and Kaiser's real goal was to eliminate a precious witness who could lead the police to his trail. An agent is convinced that Kaiser and Keaton are one and the same person: the agent has been investigating Keaton's shady past and knows that Keaton once succeeded in faking his own death. He explains to the shocked Verbal that he has been manipulated and that the shootout was a set-up by Keaton for the mere purpose of making Verbal the witness who will convince the police of his death.\n\nShaken by what he has discovered, the storyteller is set free and the agent reports his concerns to his superior. He glances at the board with the names of wanted felons - and there he spots the names of all the locations that Verbal had recounted in his tale. He drops his cup of coffee in shock; it falls to the floor - the name of Kobayashi, a Japanese ceramics manufacturer, is painted on one of the pieces. The agent recalls that the cripple didn't directly tell him both about the Kaiser and about the fact that there was no dope on the ship - he drew this intelligence out of him on his own.\n\nMeanwhile the police fax arrives with a sketch of Kaiser Söze, based on the words of an injured Hungarian illegal. No doubt: Verbal is the Kaiser, and his whole story is made up in this very room on the basis of the objects that his eyes have glimpsed. As the agent rushes out into the street, the supposed cripple has already fled. As he takes a few steps, the fearful loser Verbal subtly transforms into a self-confident man with a willful, imperious face. The symptoms of sickness are gone, and he confidently fires up a cigarette, the very same lighter that was in Kaiser's hands at the beginning of the movie. He hops into a car, driven by the man who figured in his story as Kobayashi, and takes off.\n\nSo now, when we know the narrative, it’s time to answer this question: Was the story that Verbal told the FBI agent the truth? And if yes, why did the discovery that Verbal made up those names cause the agent to realize that Verbal was Söze?\n\nThe line-up in the precinct did take place, for the cops are aware of it. We know it happened, and probably as we see it. However, the chat in the cell raises certain questions.\n\nIt is believed by many that Verbal gathered them all together at the precinct to team them up for the task he wanted to carry out. Remember? All five have crossed Kaiser's path by sabotaging small operations, and now they are in debt. Verbal swears during the interview that it was McManus who offered the job, but what if it was Verbal who proposed it? Söze is no fool, and he sees that the agent is so dazzled by his loathing for Keaton that he can easily be played around, which is why Kint reverses his position:\n\n&gt;Yes, yes, it was all Keaton! We only followed him from the beginning! I didn't know! I saw him die! I believe he died, oh my God!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Kujan: You saw what he wanted you to see. He chose you because he knew he could manipulate you. Because you are weaker than they are.\n\nBy reciting these lines, Kujan is accurately reflecting something Verbal has just pulled on him. In the movie, there is one intriguing scene where Kujan is standing behind Verbal's back and not seeing his face, while we, on the other hand, see everything, close-up. Kujan continues to accuse Keaton of everything because he himself wants to believe in this idea, while at the same time a little smile emerges on Kevin Spacey's character's face. But the smile is wiped away as soon as the agent casts a glance at the usual suspect.\n\nHere's the thing: there are specific events that Söze is completely beyond his ability to fabricate, no matter how much he wishes he could. For example, the line-up at the police department, the flights across the country, or, for example, their first job together. In the first case, the witnesses would be cops, in the case of flights, the papers or tickets, and in the case of a raid, the usual yawners.\n\nWhere there is concrete evidence, Kaiser's hands are tied, but where the evidence is his statements, he has full carte blanche. In simple words: if there are witnesses, Söze repeats what the latter said; if there are no witnesses, Kaiser fabricates as he sees fit.\n\nA logical question arises: if Kaiser can lie and control people so masterfully, was Kaiser posing to be Verbal all along? Did the cripple actually exist, and Kaiser stepped in and stole his identity right in the heart of the timeline? Or did no Verbal ever even live?\n\nWe know that Verbal made up some non-existent names and titles, but most of his story is true. This can be seen from the police reports and the agent's reaction when recent events flashed before his eyes (during a surprise revelation). I think he made up the last name Kobayashi to protect his fellow man, as we can see he also made up Redfoot, borrowing the name in the agent's office during the questioning. Otherwise, the events were all of a true nature.\n\nWell, we know that Verbal has been part of the underworld for some time: the police knew about him, so did the criminals who were present during the line-up. The police couldn't just invite some random fella with a clean slate. Naturally, the police must have photos and a Verbal’s file, which once again proves that he wasn’t born yesterday. Creating a backstory in such a case is not enough, you need to gain the trust of other criminals, and that takes time. Agent Joe Pistone under the alias Donnie Brasco, for example, took more than a year at this stage. So Söze, after all, was Verbal from the start.\n\nIf that's not enough for you, here's another fact that supports my theory: Kaiser is a Turk, and in Turkish his last name means almost the same thing as Verbal - \"To talk too much\".\n\nIn the finale, we see the cripple recovering from his disability in front of our eyes, and soon a car pulls up, driven by Kobayashi, who we already recognize. The underling arrives to pick up his master. Together they disappear from our sight and the sight of the police. Yet he gets away with another evil deed, Kaiser Soze,  the devil in the flesh who never existed.\n\nIf you prefer visuals rather than text, enjoy: [https://youtu.be/xJVkjRElhWY](https://youtu.be/xJVkjRElhWY)",

Watching the chrono order makes you look differently at some characters, especially Nathalie who comes across as less evil and is actually trying to help Leonard (as well as herself). Watching the chrono order is also a bit of a mystery because there are still things mentioned in the movie that are never actually shown. Some people think that it presents Leonard as a more sinister character but I am leaning towards the \"happy ending\" version of the film.\n\n If you think about it, by killing Teddy, Leonard is actually breaking the cycle, because Teddy is really the evil one here, he seems to have been using Leonard for a long time. Even though Leonard's motivation is to forget what Teddy told him by  killing him, by tatooing the license plate number he has created a problem for himself. What happens when he tries and track down the car again? He will find out that the owner is deceased and then what? Will he just keep doing this over and over or will he finally get the tattoo on hist chest that we see in a flashback that says \"I did it\"? Maybe he didn't actually kill his wife and they live happily ever after? Maybe Teddy was lying to him so he keeps killing for him? Fascinating movie to be sure!",

I just put in my Blu-ray disc (original/standard UK version), and it doesn't actually look that much better than Blu-ray for the opening (I assume they used pretty bad film there, or something went wrong, at any rate). The opening crane sequence even had many defects. The rest of the movie is better than the DVD, picture quality-wise, and I don't see any defects. It's not really good, though -- and the snow scenes look bad on Blu-ray because of how he made that cold effect on-set (at least, what I'm looking at, the DVD version came out better, overall). The red bathroom scene has a problem, too: the image is shaking back and forth when he first enters, with the camera at the back (no idea if this is a camera problem or post-work). (The entire thing is quite grainy, which I assume is from the original film stock, unless they just did a bad job with the Blu-ray transfer.)\n\nNote: The Blu-ray disc is from the standard Blu-ray pack set called 'Visionary Filmmaker Collection' (7 movies).\n\nBut, that's not what I wanted to talk about. I want to talk about the aspect ratios (doesn't everybody?) of this movie.\n\nFirst, it's full screen (filling up my 32\" Panasonic), yet I cannot actually find any info on what the ratio is for this disc/transfer. Second, I just put in the DVD disc (again, original/standard UK version), and the ratio is the same. The DVD case is telling me the ratio: 1.78:1 widescreen.  \n\n\nI have four questions, then:  \n(1) What is the Blu-ray ratio?;  \n(2) What is the correct ratio (to actually see as much of the image and its contents as Kubrick intended)?;  \n(3) Which do you prefer, DVD or Blu-ray?; and  \n(4) Is there a better Blu-ray transfer in the UK, or is this it?",

        "text": "This is a criticism probably many of us have already encountered when reading reviews. \n\n\"The movie has 'no plot'\", \"It's about 'nothing'\", \"goes nowhere\". The most recent movies in which I've encountered all of these is in \"Once Upon A Time In Hollywood\" and \"Licorice Pizza\". And I start wondering, do they even know the definition of story/plot? It is definitely one of the most vague criticisms you can give to a movie. \n\nAll these amazing slice of life's stories are discarded as \"nothing\", or pointless by some people. \n\nYou don't need to have a \"I'm a young, ambitious student who wants to become the best drummer of the history\" kind of description in the first 10/15 minutes of the film so you can go and say \"Alright! Now this makes sense!\". \n\nA story unfolds, just like life does. It's about how small events lead to big ones and how these make us, or our characters, change. And the two films I mentioned earlier follow this thing I've just said. \n\nThe whole post may sound dumb, but I feel like the definition of \"story\" and \"plot\" have aquired a different meaning. Like if nowadays people needed to be specifically told what the movie they are about to see is about, as if they were fearing of wasting their time. Like if they don't have enough time to watch a story develop, they just need the information as soon as possible. \n\nMaybe it has to do with short attention spans, which can lead to a lack of patience - many people won't be enthusiastic about sitting through a slow, long movie... and this applies to other kind of art too. Classic Music is meant to be enjoyed on its own, and you have to take the time to listen to a classical piece. People will prefer a short song with an easy melody and refrain, which is understandable of course, but you miss all the rest. \n\nAnyways, I'm rambling now. To give a conclusion... \"Once Upon A Time In Hollywood\" and \"Licorice Pizza\" are two recent movies that deal with this. There's even a more recent one, \"TÁR\", which amazed me when it started with a 10/15 minute long interview conversation, we don't see much of this nowadays... As well as the whole car talking sequence with Brad Pitt and Margaret Qualley in \"Once Upon A Time In Hollywood\", in which two characters have a conversation about \"nothing\" while going \"nowhere\".",

        "text": "Watching RRR sparked a discussion around how rare it is to see a celebration of friendship between male characters that has a component of intimacy to it.  To try to define this, I'm referring to \n\n* male friendships that are of significant focus in a film (not necessarily *the* focus)\n* with displays of emotional or even physical intimacy (eg guys cuddling, or showing great emotional interaction/vulnerability) \n* the intimacy goes beyond what might be comfortable for mainstream western heteronormativity, but not within a homoerotic/LGBTQIA+ relationship\n\nThe intention with the last bullet isn't to say \"no homo\", in the sense of the phrase's common homophobic connotation, but more to pinpoint something ultimately unconcerned with the \"no homo\" paradigm, and perhaps even subversive of it.  Not that RRR  even is the best example of this, but there was a sense that the movie didn't have to grapple with navigating mainstream US heteronormativity while being a self-assured celebration of male friendship in its own right.  \n\nMost of the examples [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieSuggestions/comments/pvdufc/movies_with_true_male_friendships/) don't really meet what I'm looking for, as many of these are just centered male friendships without the component of intimacy I'm trying to get at.  Although, if you feel some of these do belong on this list would love to hear your thoughts on what about them is intimate.\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts/recommendations on other films that do this, preferably any that even pushed the envelope more than RRR does (as still a relatively heteronormative film for its own country).",

        "author": "TheRetroWorkshop",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/117h9yb/first_time_horror_review_the_shining_1980_92100/",
        "text": "*Note: This review is from 6 months ago, other than a few edits I just made. I watched this on DVD. I need to watch the Blu-ray version soon (it should be even better, though it's my understanding that the original Blu-ray transfer is imperfect). And, this is the standard UK version -- not the original, full-length American version of the movie!*  \n\n\n*Disclaimer: Major spoilers!*  \n\n\nI  have seen some of this a few times -- but never the entire movie. It's  very high quality for 1980, but that makes sense with Kubrick behind the  camera, and a large budget. Profoundly influential in both detail and  overall film-making. Kubrick has a way with film. The opening itself,  with the music and the little car being pulled through deeper and deeper  into the underworld by the strings of fate  -- seemingly, an act of  symbolism (not only in terms of the hotel being hellish, but also in the  context of free will with Jack). At least, that's how I felt, watching  it, especially by the time we got to the snowy landscape, echoing a  feeling of Bracht's painting, The Shore of Oblivion. The rolling credits  at the beginning gave that feeling, too. The car being pulled along --  Jack being pulled along -- is mirrored later on, when the boy is playing  with a car on the patterned carpet, pulling it along. I also have to  make mention of the maze shot. One of the best shots I have ever seen. \n\n(I am editing this review here to include something I learnt only recently, though I did not fact-check it: I heard that in Native American culture, the maze symbolises life, with its many dead-ends. You struggle to the middle of the maze, where you find home -- where you belong, and one assumes, happiness. Not sure if anybody had this in mind for this story, but given the Native status (?) of the hotel/grounds, it's an interesting connection given how key that maze is by the end. I did see that documentary about fan theories and such, but don't much any stock in most of them, and found no evidence to support such from the movies or Kubrick, but the maze symbolism at least seems possible.)\n\nThis  is how you craft a great horror movie, and how you write a great  villain. I won't dissect it much since this has already been done for  such a classic, so, I'll just say that the way to create real suspense  and concern (for the victim) in the viewer is to ensure that there isn't  some pre-arranged understanding, some known weakness in the villain,  whereby we merely wait for the protagonist to deliver, and defeat the  evil. The aim is for a horror or terror or monster, or man, woman, or  child to be without weakness, at least, until the final moment. This  includes leaving the victims no escape. It must be as close as possible  to what Tolkien calls eucatastrophe: a sudden, unpredictable and  unexpected turn from worst to good. It's a real experience precisely  because you don't know what's going to happen next, or how it's going to  end. This movie did that very well (though the bathroom scene was a bit  iffy, as a result. It's difficult to get this right because it's just  not believable most of the time). The deep twist with this movie is  complete and utter innocence on the part of the victim (the mother and  son). That actually makes it archetypal: the worst possible punishment  for the most innocent person, for the least possible crime. In fact, the  son's powers actually give him God-like status, making it mythic in  tone (after all, Tolkien meant this in relation to The Lord of the  Rings, and gave the example of Christ). Following this meta-narrative  thinking, Jack is the Devil. The symbolism of snow is not lost on me,  either: purity and innocence, juxtaposed with death and sadness. Not,  then, an accident that Jack freezes to death in the maze.\n\nAlthough  the exposition and plot outline given to Jack by his employer nicely  connects to what I said about the opening credits, along with the  following images of the girls and blood-filled lobby, I'm not a big fan  of the plot outlining. But, in this case, it becomes clear why that was  the case. Jack was always the caretaker. It was always Jack. Though we  don't know how, or what this means. In this way, it connects back to  when Jack tells the story of how he hurt his boy by accident around 3  years ago (this timeline about adding up to the first murders and the  present day). We never know if this was literally true, or metaphorical,  or supernatural. A good plot twist, either way, and one I never saw  coming. This story keeps you guessing, keeps you on edge, with the boy's  apparent psychic powers, and the question of just what is the evil: the  hotel or Jack. The reveal of the endless papers -- 'all work and no  play makes Jack a dull boy' is just stunning. You get a clear sense here  that the problem is Jack, not the hotel.\n\nNeed  I mention the masterful acting, music, set design, framing,  composition, editing, camera work, dialogue, spectacle, and so forth?  Even the colour palette is perfect (green for death, as is common for many of his movies). His use of silence is just as  significant as his use of music and sound (as proven in *2001 (1968)*). That's because he trusts the  acting, dialogue, storytelling, his own directing, and the audience. He  is one of the best at silence. (Also, the music with the kid in the hall  with the patterned floor, that music sounds like the direct inspiration  for the Dexter theme, which is repeated again some time later, when the  boy is talking with Jack on the bed. Not to mention the now-overused  tricycle. The ball slowly rolling across the floor all by itself,  indicating -- play -- is obviously a common trick in horror movies, as  well.)\n\nNot a scary horror, but a  very suspenseful and unnerving one -- and great. One of the best  dramatisations of madness I have ever seen, and a great depiction of  evil: rationalisation, deceit, denial of responsibility, and  self-aggradation. He also clearly has some kind of complex going on. He  thinks he's a great writer, and gets outraged at his wife for his own  failings and writer's block, because he clearly cannot write. At all.  Then, it offers quite subtle additional motivation on Jack's part for  his actions with some backstory between him and his son, tying it all  together. Jack also drums up this idea of his great responsibilities,  which are, in fact, small. This is to make himself feel important and  superior. He gets a nice easy job, like looking after an empty hotel,  and places great value on this, and himself. This is crystallised when  he screams at his wife, 'you don't have the slightest idea of what a  moral or ethical principle is, do you?' He adds further by mentioning  how his future is on the line, and he must do the job properly;  otherwise, his life is over. This is known as 'catastrophising' in  psychological terms. He is looking at things at the wrong level of  analysis, assigning excess value, and ultimately blowing out his entire  motivational and emotional regulation structures. A bit like how a  certain high school student says, 'if I fail this exam, my life is  ruined'. That is because they have not properly oriented themselves with  their map of the world. Instead of just letting the 'I passed the exam'  branch die off, they have blown out the entire tree, and all the  branches upon it. Of course, this is because Jack is actually very  worried about his low-status, which makes sense -- but he is a weak man;  hence, his reaction. The film really nailed all of that in about four  lines of dialogue and thirty seconds of film. Strong indications of a  narcissistic personality disorder, with the deeper diagnosis being  inferiority complex (though I'm no doctor, of course. This is just my  understanding).\n\nOf course, she  could have taken the boy and left via the front door much sooner, at  least trying their hand at the snow for a few hours -- better than dying  inside the hotel. This is maybe the only plot issue. And, I did notice a  big, strange continuity issue with the door at the end. When he first  chops it, just one panel was out, but when it came back, both panels  were missing! (This failing lately came because of the difficulty of shooting and editing this entire section, as Kubrick was never happy with the bathroom scene.)\n\nThe final rating  speaks for itself with this masterpiece, but I do have a problem with  it: the nudity. I am almost always against it, and find it very cheap,  though I do understand the psychology of the naked woman in the bath in  this case (but there are naked women in paintings, I believe, which I don't think were required). I can also mention the strange ending. Kubrick states that it  suggests reincarnation of Jack. The entire hotel, according to one  theory, is a sort of purgatory. Though there are other theories. We can  sense that the hotel itself does have some supernatural control, but  that it's a two-way street: feeding on the darkness already within the  human heart. Akin to the One Ring from The Lord of the Rings: Jack was  already corrupt and allowed himself to be consumed by the hotel, so to speak.  \n\n\n**SCERS Rating:**\n\n**(1) Theme** \\[meta-narrative/meaning/purpose/why the story is told and arranged the way it is -- and politics, or lack thereof\\]: **8/10**\n\n**(2) Plot** \\[actions/cause-and-effect sequence of events\\]: **10/10**\n\n**(3) Character** \\[human qualities, and how they react/act towards said events\\]: **9/10**\n\n**(4) Narrative** \\[structure/continuity/how the story is told and arranged\\]: **9.5/10**\n\n**(5) Language** \\[diction/dialogue/word choice and meaning\\]: **10/10**\n\n**(6) Film-making &amp; Sound** \\[production, editing, pacing, directing, and acting, etc.; and music/score, songs, soundscape, and Foley\\]: **10/10**\n\n**(7) Cinematography** \\[lighting/camera work/framing/composition/colour palette, etc.\\]: **10/10**\n\n**(8) Spectacle** \\[effects/set design, etc.\\]: **9.5/10**\n\n**(9) Scream-o-Meter** \\[jump scares/suspense/dread/disgust/phobias/fear, etc.\\]: **7/10**\n\n**(10) Picture-Sound Quality** \\[picture/audio clarity and consistency\\]: **9/10**\n\nTotal Score: **92/100**",

The acting, the dark &amp; creepy tone, the cinematography, that rabbits short film...wow, it was hitting all my buttons. But then the second half of the film goes full Lynch and does away with any interesting plot threads set up in the first half (like the cheating storyline) and descends into full  Lynchian madness &amp; symbolism, which is *fine*, but not for me; I preferred the coherence of the first half.\n\n\n\n\nOther films that completely fell apart in the last half or final act would be films like: \n\n\n\n**Sunshine** - Tarantino did a famous rant about this one. The first half was one of the best sci-fi films I've ever seen and then, ugh..... don't want to spoil this one but it becomes a completely different film in the third act which felt like a betrayal\n\n\n\n**Enter the Void** - the first 30 minutes or so was one of the most engaging &amp; immersive film experiences I've ever seen but after a certain death it goes completely off the rails for me into the realm of experimental and arguably pretentious nonsense (did I really need to see a CG penis ejaculating inside a CG vagina?)\n\n\n\n**Kairo:** it's been a while since i've seen this but I remember it as one of the creepiest, most unique &amp; prescient horror films of the 90's, but the third act gets very silly with bad vfx.\n\n\n\n**Death Proof:** once again, the first half (with the first group of women) was shaping up to be one of Tarantino's best films for me but the second half was was jarring with the change of cast (which was a lot less likeable then the first group) and Stuntman Mike going from an intriguing sociopath to just some goofball was just, uh...jarring.\n\n\n\n\nwhat are some films in your opinion which starts off amazing but falls apart or goes off the rails in the second half?",

This is the first one:\n\nRachel Weisz: \"Maybe the problem is Julian and I never had children\"\n\nMichael Caine: \"I don't know what the problem is. But I'm not going to try to cheer you up by lying and talking about things I never knew about.\n\nYou were right. Music is all I understand. And do you know why? Because you don't need words or an experience to understand it. It just is. Your mother would've understood you. I can't. But your mother's not here.\"\n\nHarvey Keitel's character was also sat at the table and overheard the conversation. Then, later on, in a dinner scene, after Caine tells Weisz that he's retired as a musician, Keitel tells Caine the following:\n\nKeitel: \"Cut the crap. Your music conveyed surprising new emotions.\"\n\nCaine: \"Emotions can be overrated too, Mick.\"\n\nAnd finally, toward the end of the film, Keitel tells Caine the following in a hotel scene:\n\nKeith: \"You say emotions are overrated. But that's bullshit. Emotions are all we've got\".\n\nSo I have two questions here:\n\n1. Is the first scene somehow connected to the second and third scenes?\n\n2. I'm really confused about what Caine's character is trying to say with these words. Doesn't the \"Because you don't need words or an experience to understand it. It just is.\" quote contradict with \"Emotions can be overrated too\" quote? How can you possibly believe in both? Is this just cognitive dissonance on Caine's character's part?",

        "text": "No wonder this is a very widely discussed movie. Everything about it makes it near as possible to the perfect horror movie. There's so many angles to view it from, and so much ambiguity too. \n\nI think The Shining was ultimately about the evil inherent in people. \n\nAs many have pointed out, Jack was unstable from the start of the movie, before he ever reached the Overlook Hotel. I believe the Hotel did not make Jack go crazy by itself. It just brought out the worst parts of his inner self that were already there. Jack is an alcoholic, an abuser, a person who works menial jobs to make ends meet. He's impulsive, narcissistic, and uncaring. These qualities were slowly being brought out throughout the Hotel over the weeks and months he was there. \n\nHim entering Room 237 sealed his fate and gave his soul over to this place. Jack was seduced in literally less than 5 seconds after entering the room by this woman who is revealed to be a rotting corpse. After that, Jack has totally slipped into insanity and hatred. If you have will-power, it's possible for you to be unaffected in the Hotel. Remember what Tony/Danny says - they're 'just pictures.' Dick also said the same thing - sometimes there's just 'impressions' left over from bad things that happened in the past. The issue is that even mere pictures can 'get' to Jack and influence him. I feel like him being told about the previous murder also planted a seed in Jack's mind that slowly grew into the climax of being a copy-cat and attacking his own family. \n\nThere's a huge number of ways to read this movie, but one interesting thing I noticed is that it's not Jack who actually attacks Wendy. Wendy physically attacks him FIRST, and pretty brutally at that. Before that, Jack has arguably done no actual violence to anyone. Being knocked out and locked in the freezer is what prompts him to murder - like a final full justification in his mind to go the extra step. I also do NOT believe Jack ever harmed Danny with the choke marks, because after being accused, Jack was walking the hallways alone angrily pouting that he was falsely accused, which one feels he wouldn't do if he really did it. Sometimes, even a guy as repulsive as Jack can be innocent of what he's accused of. \n\nI do believe the supernatural elements are real, but not in the way most people think. The spirits here have almost no real power. They can just break extremely weak people like Jack, and maybe communicate a bit with Danny. There is an exception: when the energy is so negative like in Room 237, it can be powerful enough tip Jack over the edge, and physically harm Danny. But overall, Wendy notices no spirits until the end because none of it is real to her, not even Tony. Only at the end is she overwhelmed with negative energy that even she begins noticing what she previously ignored and denied existence to. \n\nI'd wager that Jack died because he couldn't find his way out of the maze at the end, just like in his life he became easily lost. He ended up freezing to death. Plastered on his face is a look of dissatisfaction and even hatred. I feel like the last image of Jack in the photo was symbolic and ghostly, not real. The suggestion kept being planted to Jack that he was \"always\" the caretaker, when that was objectively false and obviously impossible. Yet Jack was so weak that he believed in it to give himself some kind of identity outside of being a washed-out alcoholic who was always struggling,",

        "text": "This article refers to two specific film stills. For a fully illustrated version please click here -\n\n[https://filmofileshideout.com/archives/geeking-out-over-a-minor-detail-in-f-w-murnaus-nosferatu/](https://filmofileshideout.com/archives/geeking-out-over-a-minor-detail-in-f-w-murnaus-nosferatu/)\n\nI’ve seen Murnau’s *Nosferatu* dozens of times. It’s one of my favorites. Somewhere along the line, I noticed a minor detail that brought a smile to my face.\n\nThe second half of the film takes place in the fictional city of Wisborg. There are two scenes, or really two shots that were photographed in either Lübeck or Wismar, in Northern Germany. \n\nThe first shot is of the town crier with his drum, marching down the street to announce the coming of the dreaded plague. To capture this moment, Murnau found a high window in a building where he could get a view of the street leading back into the distance. He waited until the row of houses that lined the street cast a jagged shadow down the middle of the cobblestones and shot as the town crier made his way along.\n\nThe second shot comes later in the film. It is shot from the same location and at the same time of day, as evidenced by the position of the shadows. The shot is part of a scene where our heroine, Ellen, tries to muster the courage to destroy the vampire. She looks out the window, but this time Murnau films a funeral procession making its way slowly down the street.\n\nBoth shots are filmed from the same window, but one is meant to be an objective record of the town crier, while the other is meant to be the subjective depiction of Ellen’s point of view.\n\nIt took many viewings before I noticed an important difference between the objective shot and the subjective shot. The objective shot is done with the window open, so we cannot see where the camera is filming from. We just perceive that we are high up looking at the troubled town. Ellen’s shot is filmed with the window closed, and so we see an out-of-focus window pane at the bottom of the frame, reminding us that this is one person’s individual perception. It’s a minor detail, but it took deliberate planning and forethought. To drive the point home, Murnau also vignettes the frame.\n\nIt is a small detail, but the movie was filmed in 1922, when the language of film was still developing. Murnau shows not only an impressive eye for detail, but an understanding of the objective and subjective lens.",

        "text": "The takeaway so many people have with \"Us\" is that \"The clone Adelaide we follow is the true villain for stealing the ORIGINAL Adelaide's life\"  But that is what is interesting: The reason \"Red\" AKA the original Adelaide wants to get revenge is for being forced to live in those tunnels, correct? So living in the tunnels is a bad thing, obviously. And yet, when the cloned Adelaide escaped the tunnels - we're supposed to hate her for wanting the exact same thing that Red wanted? Because it's almost like saying \"the poor people should stay suffering in the poor place and the well-off people should stay well off\" when it's much more complicated than that. \n\nI think Peele was making a statement about the “I got mine so fuck yours”/always wanting something better mentality of the USA. Adelaide’s husband is constantly jealous of their rich friends and their possessions; meanwhile the tethered are mad at the surface dwellers for enjoying a life of luxuries they take for granted. And the people at the top, the rich Tylers, who have it all, are still miserable. It’s an attitude infecting America…which BTW this film has Hands across AMERICA, a thing that was meant to “combat” poverty. Red responding to Gabe “We’re Americans!” United States = US. This movie is about the U.S. and this movie is about “us” as a country.\n\nTHAT is the whole conversation that Peele was trying to start, I believe.",

        "text": "Before I start, I would like to give my reasons for writing this and explain some basic facts about myself to give this a bit more context.\n\n* My main reason is the relative obscurity of Slovenian cinema, both worldwide and in Slovenia. I also didn't find anything talking about Slovenian cinema that is easily accessible online for the regular folk. If you don't speak Slovene then it is pretty hard to find any actual love for our cinema online.\n* I chose this sub, because it has a large base of followers, is active and people here are actually interested in learning about cinema. \n* I'm an amateur film lover like the rest of you. I don't have a PhD in film studies nor am I a film theorist or a published critic. So if you think I got anything wrong or left anything out, please say so. I would also like to invite all Slovenians and people familiar to Slovenian cinema to participate.\n* I would love for you all to ask as many questions as possible, debate about what I will write and in general engage with this post. I am no expert of Slovenian cinema, just a Slovene observing things.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**WHY IS SLOVENIAN CINEMA IN SUCH A BAD SHAPE, A TALE OF HISTORY AND MONEY.**\n\nYou could says that a country like ours, with about over 2 million citizens cannot have a developed or influential cinema. But the Check Republic has and still plays an important role in international cinema even with just over 10 million people. It is not a matter of population, even tho it plays a role (Nobody with less then 50 million people can actually produce blockbuster film). It's a matter of approach and Slovenian approach is terrible and lacking behind the rest of the world.\n\nWhy is it terrible? We must go to the beginning to understand. At first Slovenian cinema was a part of Yugoslav cinema. We had two organizations that produced films locally, but were really under the boot of the main Yugoslav organization for film. This lasted from about the start of the 60's to about 1975, when those two organizations just kinda died out. Most of our films from that period were incredibly simple and rudimentary, lacking not only behind American, but also European and Asian film. Most films were propaganda about Partisans or good old fashioned Slovenian values and folk tales. If you watch these films, they look like they were made in the 1930's. But there are still gems hidden in between.\n\nThen came some turbulent years for Slovenian film. A new organization was made, which was a bit more independent from Yugoslav cinema's control. It is still around today and still produces like 90% of our film. I think it is called Viba. Where the last period had two good directors that tried to keep up with Europe in terms of complexity, this era had nothing. The only thing this era can show for is one single good film (Probably the best film in Slovenian cinema history), but that film was more of a lucky fluke amongst piles of nothing. This lasted until 1991, when Slovenia became independent.\n\nBut you have to know that for most of our cinematic history there were not a lot of films produced. From 1948 to 2020 there were maybe 3 features a year with some years being completely dry. \n\nYou have to know the difference of how film is produced here and how it is in America. Here films cannot really turn a profit, due to the very small cinema going public so there is really no way to compete with American film. This is why there are no or almost no producers that finance their own projects. So our government and before that the Yugoslav government financed film themselves. There is a public fund, into which our country puts money to be used for film. The same applies to other cultural activities. So all these private studios and production houses are actually completely reliant on government funding to make film.\n\nSo after 1991, the Slovenian government decided to partner with Viba. This basically made Viba the engine of Slovenian cinema. Our government put money in and the engine would roll out film. This organization lead to more academic and festival oriented film-making. Since it was not going to make profit it could at least get some awards. \n\nThe 90's produced some interesting film, but if you compare that to international cinema, we were still years behind. So then the 2000's rolled around and our government threw even more money into film, but not quite enough to produce more then 4 a year. Funnily enough the most groundbreaking and popular film of the 2000's was a self financed crime comedy made to entertain.\n\nThen the 2010's were more of the same, but at the start of the 2010's our government did invest in a comedy for the masses, which turned profit for the first time in history so naturally they did a sequel. Then two local YouTube personalities made a self financed comedy and that is now the highest grossing film in Slovenian cinema history.\n\nThen in 2020 a right wing government, which took over right before corona due to our prime minister resigning. This government and its president were engaged in a little media war with some of our left leaning popular artists. So naturally they closed the pipe to most cultural activities and Slovenian film suffered.\n\nIn 2022 we had general elections and elected a left leaning party. After a protest of about 100 filmmakers wearing black masks at our national film festival, we now have 11 films in production in 2023 alone. Never have we had more then 3 or 4 a year and now the government has allocated more then 3 million euros to film. It is an exciting time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**A STORY OF STYLE GONE WRONG**\n\nBecause there was never any actual money involved with Slovenian film we never really had people dedicated primarily to film, there were exceptions, but very rare exceptions. \n\nOne thing we Slovenians can be proud of in the art world is our Theater. As far as I've followed it and talked to people that are active in it, we are doing great. Our Theater gets relatively a lot of money, has a big culture built around it and attracts the masses in our regional amateur theaters. But we are also not lacking behind in complexity and innovation. Most of our artists work or have worked for theater in some form or another. We have a lot of scholars and writers constantly pondering theory and a public that is somewhat aware of this. I mean, most of our famous people are theater actors and directors. \n\nBut what that means is that when it came to creative approaches to film (aka, what was not Yugoslav propaganda) was quickly transformed into an exercise of theater. Most Slovenian film back in the day was shot like one would shoot a theater script. It was clunky and flat. No thought was given to the visual, just the textual. Same happened with script. Writers form theater began writing for film, but in the same way they wrote for the stage. Conversation and static dialogue began to control the narrative and the visual element was neglected. Same with acting. A lot of our film is riddled with actors pretending to be on stage. The delivery of the stage becomes awkward on film. Nobody adjusted to the medium.\n\nIn the 90's we finally developed a visual language. But when everyone else was experimenting, we were trying to figure out the basics. Then in the 2000's we finally started to drift away from theater acting. Still there were actors pretending to be on the stage, but it was much better.\n\nThen came the 2010's. Slovenian filmmakers decided they wanted to stay away from theater, as far as possible. Modern films began to look way more naturalistic. They wanted to film \"reality\". But this clashed with how they still wrote dialogue or staged scenes. The dialogue still felt and still feels stiff and the common practice of actor arriving, standing there, talking and then going away was still there. There were films that broke this ground, but then we would slide back into it.\n\nThis theater leftover stiffness is still present in most film. Most actors, directors and writers come from theater and most of the technical workers (cameraman, director of photography, sound, editing,...) come from either TV news or reality TV. They don't work in the same creative space. They don't connect with each other. There is no synergy, because there is no common ground.\n\nIt is driving me nuts to see Slovenian film so behind the times. There is yet to be a Slovenian feature film that employs some experimental things. Something to keep pace with the rest of the world. I want to see one film that I can say didn't have influence of our theater in it.\n\nBut at the same time we do have a lot of experimentation in our short films. We have a lot of young people, especially in stop motion animation, producing great shorts. But they are small in number and running away. Most of them find work elsewhere. Our most famous director recently directed a Hollywood movie, because he couldn't get work here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ELITISM**\n\nThere is only one school and in that school one program that is built around film. That is film and TV program at the college of Audio, Theater, Radio, Film and TV. And in that program there is only film direction which actually studies film.\n\nThey only accept one or three candidates per year. I mean that is crazy. Yes you get resources, but to accept just a couple people into our film program is stupid. \n\nThen there is the fact that, that school is monolithic. They only teach one way of doing film, they push students towards that view of cinema. That schools stairs down a narrow road of cinema and hates change. They are dogmatic in that sense. These are not only my opinions, but have been shared by some independent filmmakers here in Slovenia. The school cannot produce innovation if it is stuck in the past.\n\nThe school is run by our theater people. They impose the so called talent testing, where you have to make a short film to be let into the program. I've heard, but have not seen conformation that they reject people that enter with experimental films and even fun action/comedy films. As long as you follow their hollow aesthetic of naturalism mixed with misguided theater practices then you are fine.\n\nI blame this for the sameness of Slovenian cinema. Where most film feels the same, has a similar structure and also has the same clunky theaterisms. \n\nThe next thing is the elitism of our academics. They are not interested and even reject popular film. They only release most Slovenian films for a couple days in one obscure cinema in one city. It's like they are making private showings. Maybe one or two films per year make it to the popular cinemas for a very limited run. There is no marketing. I sometimes find a paragraph in a newspaper about a new Slovenian film that came out for two days, one showing per day in one city in one cinema. They show them in festivals and then these films are gone, mostly winning small prizes. Nobody that is not already a part of the film scene will ever know that these even exist.\n\nOur academics are also a bunch of circlejerkers. They have one magazine, where they discuss very obscure, often new wave (yeah the 60's and 70's new wave) stuff. They are obsessed with the French new wave. I mean come on. The magazine is also not sold on public stands and doesn't have commercials. You have to seek it out, subscribe and wait months between new issues. I am the only person I know that is aware that it exists.\n\nBut when you open the magazine expecting news about new and exciting experimentation and innovation in global film you only get discussions of old cinema or talk about our cinema of the 60's. And I checked multiple issues online. There was a mention of a 2002 film at one time. And then they use very academic terms, mixing theater in constantly and making the magazine unapproachable by the regular folk and even the regular film buff.\n\nSo maybe reviews in newspapers then. Two problems tho. Nobody uses newspapers anymore except old folk and second, these reviews are just quick plot summaries of foreign blockbusters with a star rating.\n\nAlso getting work in film if you were not in either theater or that school is barely possible. There are a couple public auditions a year, hidden in obscure websites. Slovenian film has become an insular discussion of a couple rich, white people that mainly come form theater. If you don't live in the capitol your chances of working in film are zero. Besides showings of American blockbusters there is no cinema culture outside Ljubljana.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A COUPLE IMPORTANT AND GOOD FILMS**\n\nHere I will include films that brake the mold and not the sea of naturalism getting fucked by theater that our cinema has become. I want you to watch some incredible or important Slovenian films and not just some random schlock. Trying to create a sort of cannon for international audiences, because it doesn't exist yet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*  **On our own land (1948)** \\- First Slovenian film, also not bad. The director's name is France Štiglic. He was the first innovator of Slovenian film, basically inventing it. He was even nominated for the best foreign film at the Oscars in 1960 I think for Yugoslavia. [https://letterboxd.com/film/on-our-own-land/](https://letterboxd.com/film/on-our-own-land/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Vesna (1953)** \\- More of a cultural landmark then a good film, but worth a watch. [https://letterboxd.com/film/vesna/](https://letterboxd.com/film/vesna/)  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Kekec (1951) -** Just a cultural icon adapted to film, nothing much, but it is a decent kids film. [https://letterboxd.com/film/kekec/](https://letterboxd.com/film/kekec/) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Dancing in the rain (1961)** \\- Probably one of the best things to come out of Slovenian cinema. The director is Boštjan Hladnik, who is praised as the best Slovenian director and I have to agree. This man was not ahead of his time globally, but definitely locally. When I mentioned two good directors from the 60's I meant him and Štiglic. This is where quite a bit of the Check New Wave influence can be seen. Prague has played an important role in Slovenian cinematic development. [https://letterboxd.com/film/dancing-in-the-rain/](https://letterboxd.com/film/dancing-in-the-rain/) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Hang on, Doggy (1977)** \\- A very cute kids film about a dog and a boy and it weirdly presents a complex picture of life in Yugoslav Ljubljana from a perspective of a kid. [https://letterboxd.com/film/hang-on-doggy/](https://letterboxd.com/film/hang-on-doggy/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **A summer in a sea shell (1985)** \\- A teen comedy that turns serious towards the end. Presents a nice picture of teen life in our little coastal towns. Directed by Tugo Štiglic, but unlike his father he was not much of a talent. But he did leave a lasting legacy on our TV programs and archives. Also this movie has an amazing soundtrack. [https://letterboxd.com/film/a-summer-in-a-sea-shell/](https://letterboxd.com/film/a-summer-in-a-sea-shell/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **My Dad, the Socialist Kulak (1987)** \\- Some say it lacks in the visual department, but the script, acting and the overall direction of this is amazing. I would call it our only masterpiece. It is heavily reliant on specifics of our language to tell its story, so maybe the English subtitles wont give you the entire picture. [https://letterboxd.com/film/my-dad-the-socialist-kulak/](https://letterboxd.com/film/my-dad-the-socialist-kulak/) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Outsider (1997)** \\- Our very own bad guy movie. Reminiscent of Taxi driver and American Psycho, but less good, more of a mimick and more of an exercise in violence. It is controversial today, because of a very tasteless rape scene that most call unnecessary and I agree. [https://letterboxd.com/film/outsider-1997/](https://letterboxd.com/film/outsider-1997/) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Rooster's Breakfast (2007)** \\- It's an okay drama that is very highly praised here. [https://letterboxd.com/film/roosters-breakfast/](https://letterboxd.com/film/roosters-breakfast/) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Here and There (2005)** \\- Basically just lock, stock and two smoking barrels, but made for way less money and it shows. This is the highly popular self-financed I mentioned before. Directed by Mitja Okorn. [https://letterboxd.com/film/here-and-there-2005/](https://letterboxd.com/film/here-and-there-2005/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Going our way (2010)** \\- A very popular comedy, with the Slovenian equivalent of Jack Black in the main role. [https://letterboxd.com/film/going-our-way/](https://letterboxd.com/film/going-our-way/) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Class Enemy (2013)** \\- The strongest performance ever put to film in Slovenia. Also the film itself is pretty good. [https://letterboxd.com/film/class-enemy/](https://letterboxd.com/film/class-enemy/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **At Hostar (2016)** \\- Highest grossing film in Slovenian history, but it is very bad and loud and obnoxious. [https://letterboxd.com/film/at-hostar/](https://letterboxd.com/film/at-hostar/) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **My last year as a Loser (2018)** \\- Directed by Urša Menart. A very deep look into some of Slovenia's modern problems when it comes to 20 somethings who've finished college and have nowhere to go. One of the rare films with so little theater influence, that if you don't understand Slovene then you don't even see it, because it hides in dialogue.

        "text": "In 2022, *The Fabelmans*, *Babylon*, and *Empire of Light* all wanted to be love letters to film. With streaming, COVID, and franchise movies looming, I kinda get it. What I found interesting instead was *The Menu*, a film that does not want to celebrate film. High-class dining and those who participate in it (both on the creative side and the consumer side) serve as an allegory for how film has suffered a similar fate to Chef Slowik and Hawthorn. \n\n\nI think the film allegory in *The Menu* is most strongly recognized by its characters, each of which who represent different participants in the film industry. Here's some of the most important characters and how they relate to the film industry:\n\n\nStarting with **Tyler**, a representative of all cinephiles. Tyler knows everything there is to know about food, and the processes in which the food is made. He even demystifies the starter dish, noting that it's created with a pacojet. The only thing he doesn't know about cooking is cooking itself. When Chef Slowik insists that Tyler cooks, he makes a fool of himself. He knows about all the tools and processes, yet can't execute upon something as simple as cutting up a shallot. Much like Tyler, the cinephile has the same predicament. They are cursed with the knowledge that lies behind all filmmaking, yet are unable to become filmmakers themselves. Their demystification of the art means that there is no movie magic. At the end of the day, they're just another consumer.\n\n**Bryce, Soren, and Dave** are the producers. They're the ones who have financial control over the restaurant, but what they *really* want is creative control. They hate that something as simple as bread isn't being served. To them, they don't see the value in eating at Hawthorn and being able to experience Chef Slowik's creations. If they had it their way, then Hawthorn would just be another McDonald's, and Chef Slowik would be simply someone to steer the ship. When the film shows the tax returns and how they fudged the numbers on those, it's an allegory for how studios fudge box office numbers in order to hide profits from the directors and cast and funnel money to themselves.\n\n**Lillian and Ted** are, of course, critics. I think the shot at critics is made fairly obvious by the tortilla scene. A bad review can tank a restaurant in the same way that a bad review can tank a director's career. There's also the broken emulsion - much like Tyler, it's easy to have the knowledge that the technique behind an art could be better. Having the technique to do that art is much more difficult.\n\nJohn Leguizamo's character actually doesn't even have a name (I had to look it up!) and is simply referred to as **Movie Star**. It's actually pretty clever - he's just another movie star clinging onto whatever relevance that remains. The Movie Star's sin is that he no longer cares about art. Even worse, he's completely detached from it. Slowik hates the Movie Star because he saw a movie that he starred in that was terrible. Not only was the film terrible, but it was also on one of Slowik's few days off. The Movie Star has no apologies for this. For him, he was just getting another paycheck. I would bet that Slowik doesn't really care that much about a terrible movie on his day off. For him, the apathy the Movie Star shows is worse than any film he could have made.\n\n**Margot** is the average movie-goer. In a way, she is uncorrupted. For her, the fancy foods and the magic behind it all don't really do anything for her. She's interested, but the cinephile's obsession drives her away. Her request for a simple cheeseburger doesn't show her lack of appreciation for the finer things in life but an appreciation for the simple things. Since Margot is also a part of the service industry, Chef Slowik likes that she's able to see past all the bullshit and enjoy something everyone can enjoy.\n\nLastly, there is **Chef Slowik**. Chef Slowik is jaded. His sole purpose in life, cooking, is now a meaningless dog and pony show, mostly \"enjoyed\" by the richest of the rich. Even worse, those who are capable of appreciating it are nitpickers and wannabes, incapable of enjoying something simply for the sake of enjoying it. Part of why Chef Slowik likes Margot is because she *is* capable of enjoying something simply for the sake of enjoying it. She asks for a cheeseburger - any cheeseburger would have done. In a film filled with high dining and visually intriguing dishes, this humble cheeseburger is probably the most appetizing item shown. Two smashed patties with onions and yellow American cheese on a sesame seed bun with a side of fries. It takes Chef Slowik back to his days as a humble burger flipper, back when he knew what he was serving was not a dish meant to be picked apart by critics, analyzed by amateur foodies, and questioned by those who fund him. At the same time, it's far from another mass produced cheeseburger from another franchise. Chef Slowik shows that there's room in the middle for things that aren't just another bite, but also can just be simply enjoyed.\n\n\n\nAnd that's what *The Menu* is. You can analyze a film like *The Menu* all you want, but at the end of the day, this is a film that sits between the franchise movies and the arthouse films. It's a nice cheeseburger. It's not the best thing you'll eat all year, but there's one day when you're eating a quarter pounder and you'll think about how you wish it was half as good as that other cheeseburger you had.",

        "text": "I am a cinephile in the making, but it sometimes feels like the list of important films just go on and on. It is pretty hard to know where to start if you wanna go through the canon.\n\nI must admit that I am a sucker for lists, which means that Sight and Sound and TSPDT have given me a great starting point. I don’t ever let these lists affect my opinion though, I just think they are a good and easy way of learning about films and directors and get a sense of a particular film’s importance in cinema history.\n\nThat said, I stumbled upon a conundrum. I realized early in my journey, that I was still missing out on something. It felt like I was only scratching the surface watching all these “greatest of all time” films, but never getting to know the artists behind them. So I stopped checking all these great films out, and started focusing on the directors I knew  and liked (Godard, Fellini, Bergman) and their catalogues. These are all directors with many films under their belts, which makes it a bit harder to get to know them fully unlike directors like Tarkovsky with only 7 films.\n\nSee, I have for a long period now been limiting myself to a few directors rather than watching 1 or 2 movies from different directors. And now I just feel like I’m missing out. Especially when S&amp;S dropped their new lists, there were so many directors I didn’t even know.\n\nSo my question is, what do you think is the best method for digging into cinema history. Do you think it’s best to focus on the “greatest” films canon or the “greatest directors” canon (Because not every director has a flawless catalogue)? Do you think it’s something completely other thing? My real problem is probably lack of patience, so I just wanted to hear your opinion on the fastest way to become an expert on the subject.\n\n(I realize it began to sound like I was just looking at lists and “collecting” movie experiences. This is not what I’m doing. I just wanna experience as many different things as I can, so I can really expand my knowledge of the medium and widen the spectrum of my film vocabulary, so to speak. Hope you get what I’m saying)",

        "text": "Ritwik Ghatak was a well-known Indian director, screenwriter, and actor, best known for his work in the Parallel Cinema movement of the 1950s and 1960s. Ghatak was born in Dhaka, now Bangladesh, in 1925, during a period of political upheaval and cultural upheaval that greatly inspired his cinematic vision. Ghatak's works were profoundly founded in his own experiences, reflecting his concern for the social and political realities of the day.\n\nGhatak's career includes eight feature films, all of which are considered Indian cinema classics. His films were frequently distinguished by poetic realism, complex characters, and nuanced narratives. One of his most well-known films (\"meghe dhaka tara\" (the cloud-capped star))[https://boxd.it/ix2] is a heartfelt depiction of a family striving to make ends meet in post-partition West Bengal. The film is widely recognised as a classic for its realistic representation of a poor family's daily problems, as well as the nuanced performances of its actors.\n\n(\"Subarnarekha\")[https://boxd.it/33HM] another of Ghatak's most acclaimed films, addresses the issues of relocation and identity in post-partition India. The film portrays the narrative of a family forced to leave their birthplace and start over in another area of the country. The film's striking images and compelling storyline have made it an Indian cinema cult classic.\n\nOther significant works by Ghatak include (\"Ajantrik\" (The Unmechanical))[https://boxd.it/5aLK] a story about a man's passion for his car, and \"Jukti Takko Aar Gappo,\" a film that tackles the notions of Marxism and revolution through a complex narrative structure.\n\nDespite being admired by film aficionados and critics alike, Ghatak's works were not commercially successful during his lifetime. His impact on cinema, however, is indisputable, as he was essential in developing the Parallel Cinema movement in India. With their profound social commentary, complex storytelling, and cinematic vision, Ghatak's films continue to inspire and challenge audiences today.",

        "text": " On the surface, both *Taxi Driver* and *First Blood* seem to have a similar plot: a special operations veteran from the Vietnam War having trouble reintegrating into society. *First Blood* obviously fits this as we know for sure that John Rambo was in the Special Forces, and we can obviously see the trouble he faces as he attempts to be a civilian in the real world after war. However, *Taxi Driver* is not so obvious.\n\nThe \"official\" backstory for Travis Bickle as said by Martin Scorsese himself in an interview (apparently, as I have not yet found the actual source) is that he was \"Special Forces in the Marines.\" A quick internet search will inform you that the [Special Forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Special_Forces) are only the U.S. Army \"Green Berets,\" and that they are the only special operations unit in the U.S. referred to as \"Special Forces.\" This could easily be a detail mistake by Scorsese, and he may have meant Travis Bickle was a [Reconnaissance Marine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps_Reconnaissance_Battalions), which would explain his jump wings on his jacket.\n\nIn my opinion, however, Bickle is a liar. The only proof we have of his service is when he states that he \"served in the Marines\" at the beginning of the film, his Marine Corps T-shirt when he does pull-ups, and the jump wings on his jacket, which may indicate he was in a Reconnaissance Battalion. This could also indicate that he really did see combat action and that he was not some regular support troop. However, unlike Rambo, Bickle does not display the mannerisms of a combat-hardened veteran. He handles weapons in a very juvenile and untrained manner and also, in my reaching opinion, approaches his new workout regimen in a very beginner-like way.\n\nThe most contradictory thing he does though, is give himself a mohawk haircut, which is actually an [Army WWII-era 101st Airborne tradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filthy_Thirteen), and not a Marine Corps one. I do not think a Marine with the supposed experience like Bickle would willingly co-opt an Army tradition to make himself feel tougher. This leads me to believe that Bickle lied about his service to feel more important, as the whole idea of his character is that of a loner and a wannabe. He is known to be an unreliable narrator, so even his military experience is up for question.\n\nMany interpret *Taxi Driver* as a film that really delves into how a combat veteran tries to reintegrate into society, but there are way too many details that say otherwise. What do you think? Does *Taxi Driver* possess the same Vietnam War combat veteran story as *First Blood*, or is *Taxi Driver* its own film about a lying wannabe loner?",

        "text": "So I, like many others, gained greater appreciation for Back to the Future as I grew older, recognizing the subtler themes of sexual abuse and emotional recoil— Lorraine clearly over-corrected in light of the sexual assault she most certainly faced from Biff. The film shows how this trauma had a massive ripple-effect in Lorraine’s life later on, as her husband was a clear “safe” choice, she lived as a much more anxious and suppressed woman, and her approach to parenting was certainly more dysfunctional. This aspect of facing the real and sobering consequences of sexual abuse offers such a great layer of depth to Back to the Future.\n\nThat being said, I noticed a small additional aspect to this story upon a recent rewatch. On topic of thematic sexual abuse, I noticed that there seems to be an intentional reason as to why Lorraine is so condemning of stereotypical teenage behavior among her kids. Clearly, this is hypocritical, as Lorraine’s 1955 character implies that she is clearly experienced in terms of the typical highschool behaviors— in the parked car she hints to Marty that she has sexual experience, that she parties, etc. \n\nI believe that the film implies that Lorraine quite likely experienced much self-blame and suppressed internalization in the wake of her sexual trauma— that she would end up believing that her “irresponsible” teenage decisions were in part her fault for how she was abused. \n\nWith this is mind, it makes a whole lot more sense to me as to why Lorraine was passionately adamant about hypocritically forbidding this type of behavior in her children, since she directly equated it to her sexual assault. \n\n\nI wouldn’t be surprised if this is nothing particularly new to y’all, but, at least for me, I found it quite interesting!",

        "text": "This might be a good way to compare tastes and find some interesting recommendations on the way.  Not everyone uses the /10 scala, so feel free to rate however you rate, and share how close your rating got to your initial expectations.\n\nIn my book 9's &amp; 10's (and 1's &amp; 2's) are quite rare, but some do deserve it.  The vast majority of all films I've seen score between 3 &amp; 8.\n\n\nMy last 10:\n\nUs  (2019)  -  9/10\nRashomon  (1950)  -  6/10\nThe Innocents  (1961)  -  8/10\nDark Water  (2002)  -  4/10\nQuo Vadis  (1951)  -  7/10\nGalaxy Quest  (1999)  -  8/10\nTerminator Genisys 3D  (2015)  -  4/10\nDune 3D  (1984)  -  3/10\nThe Thief of Bagdad  (1940)  -  7/10\nGodzilla 3D  (2014)  -  6/10\n\n\nConclusion:  old movies score well.  \n\nI wasn't expecting to rate Thief of Bagdad higher than Rashomon, but its likeable charm won out over Rashomon's eccentricity.   \n\nOn horrors:  I'd been looking forward to Dark Water for years, disappointed by how below-average it turned out.  This was nicely offset by the very good The Innocents (which I was expecting to like) and being blown away by Us...that caught me by surprise, wasn't expecting much from that (haven't yet seen Get Out).\n\nOn 3D (using home cinema with large projector screen):  Dune &amp; T:Genisys I went in with lowered expectations and still didn't get much out of them, other than a feeling of wasted time.  Godzilla I suspected might be the best of the three, and so it proved.  The Bluray-3D effect of all three movies was nothing special.  It seems for every Avatar or Infinity War, there's a big handful of movies that don't put much effort into the 3D-experience.\n\nQuo Vadis I was expecting to like - coming off a recent watch of Ben Hur - it started slow but the second-half met my expectations.  Enjoyable epic.\n\nGalaxy Quest is the only one I'd seen before, probably almost two decades ago.  A rewatch confirmed my old impression: very funny!  \n\n\nSo Us &amp; The Thief of Bagdad were the pleasant surprises.  Dark Water, and to a lesser extent Rashomon, the disappointments.  The rest were roughly on par with expectations.\n\n\nWhat about yous?",

Simply that these films can be easily consumed by newcomers to the \"film world\", compared to harder-to-digest pieces- I don't know why he specifically comes up in my mind but Cronenberg, for example. \n\nOf course, the first ones that spring to mind personally are Spielberg and Tarantino. Spielberg's films are a part of nearly everybody's childhood and I'd wager anyone under the age of 50 has had some childhood memory about jurassic Park, Jaws or Indiana Jones. His filmography is so large that his presence in all media is virtually omniscient, and so I'd say he'd surely qualify for this title. QT, on the other hand, is, to a lesser degree of course, a household name but also the \"cool\" director when you're a young adult. Pulp fiction is an incredibly easy film to get into (provided that you have a strong stomach) with its flashy violence and even more dynamic dialogue and soundtrack that many can easily fall in love with, myself included. \n\nI'm interested to hear other people's thoughts though, and it doesn't necessarily have to apply to \"household name\" directors- many filmmakers fly under the radar but have some seriously famous output that helps introduce people into the film world.",

I'm sure some of you here are more knowledgeable than I am and I'd like to read some more informed opinions.\n\n I've wondered about this for a while, but I got curious again because of this Regé Jean-Page quote from Variety, which angered some Film Twitter people I follow (who I respect but I believe can be reactionary about cinema: )\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;**There’s been a lot of discourse about “the death of the movie star.” Do you believe that the concept of the movie star is dead?**   \n&gt;  \n&gt;To cry about that particular tragedy, it’s like, “Okay, but are there good movies?” I’m not sure that I was ever in love with going to a movie to see the actor. I go to the movies to see *the movie.* It’s like crying that there are no rock star sound designers anymore. This one department isn’t getting this outsized amount of attention that they got used to for a while? Cry me a river, man.\n\nAs a viewer I never cared much for movie stars. This is in part because as a kid/teen I used to have a hard time telling their faces apart, and I thought it was unfair how all the attention was centered around a handful of conventionally attractive people, who weren't necessarily any better at acting than the rest. I didn't see why DiCaprio, Cruise, Clooney or Jolie were heralded as the best actors on Earth when people like John Goodman or John C.Reilly (for example) were just as good, they just didn't look as hot.\n\n(I'm generalizing here, as Depardieu is a huge star in France and certainly not \"hot\" for example)\n\nBesides I do think actors get too much focus over other moviemaking jobs when they are only one piece of the puzzle. In one Bertrand Tavernier documentary, he tells the story of Jean Gabin yelling at some technician asking him to move for lighting/shot composition reasons. I was somewhat upset at how easily Tavernier's film took Gabin's side in the matter, while I thought the technician was within his rights. After all an actor isn't a movie by himself, he has to fit into a broaded plan that sometimes gets ignored by audiences, or worse by directors.\n\nOf course over time I somewhat got the appeal of seeing someone familiar over and over again, for example I always enjoy seeing Steve Buscemi partly because he was one of the few actors I could consistently recognize. But I've never considered a movie worth watching just for him.\n\nThat said, I also understand how the focus in advertising shifted from actors to franchises as most popular movies became part of big preexisting IPs, and that's also a concern. One of the advantages of movie stars was that they could sell a weird or artistically ambitious movie based on their name alone. I'm not sure whether that's still possible today. About a decade ago Brad Pitt could get some people to watch The Tree of Life, but I'm not sure Tom Holland could get audiences to watch anything that's not Spider-Man.\n\nTo an extent it's not entirely different, people want more of what they already like, except they want more Batman/Star Wars/whatever instead of more Tom Cruise/Keanu Reeves/whoever. But I understand how it could be seen as a step back for cinema.",

        "text": "Firstly, I should say that this is my first Apichatpong Weerasethakul movie, and I loved the movie’s artistry, atmosphere and delivery. I like slow-paced movies in general, mainly because they remind the audience that time exists, and indeed life is not just about successive events, and these “times between events” in fact constitute most of our lives. This movie has an additional dimension to that use. Yes, it shows that time passes between events and gives us a moment to appreciate it, but it does it in such a way that the movie becomes a transcendental, relaxing, meditating experience. In fact, I had a bad headache before starting the movie, but I started not to feel it as it progressed, the amazing sound design, the sound of the environment and the sound of everyday actions calmed me down so profoundly that I found myself in the movie. It makes one be aware of his/her surroundings, which I think the main purpose of the movie, and while doing so it makes everything but itself imperceivable.\n\nAs for the plot, seemingly it is about a woman, Jessica, mourning her sister’s death, who dreams/recollects the events that preceded the death, that’s why the memories, even though being reasonable as individuals, seemed to be mixed up. Many conversations like the one about a dentist hint this, and this is why Jessica is very misplaced, sad and confused throughout the events. Maybe she is trying to get over with her life by pursuing the sound that she hears, which is also present in her dreams. This “dream sequence” takes about half of the movie, in which she is seen to be concentrated on the sound, maybe as a distraction. She also sees a doctor, presumably for psychiatric help, and asks her for pills, maybe to cope with her loss and her depression. In this journey, she experiences beautiful sounds in her surroundings, for example, the sounds of the nature, but she insists to concentrate on the strange sound. This seems to be the main theme of like three quarters of the movie.\n\nWhile these happened, the slow-paced nature of the movie and the surrounding sounds took me to another world, but when, towards the end, she met older Hernán, the story started to unveil, which bugged me. Although the theme of sad memories, traumatic past and grieve continued, which was a closure that Jessica needed, science fiction also intervened. And then, the spaceship happened. This killed my joy and my hype for the movie, it wasn’t a closure that the movie needed, so I couldn’t really get its purpose. But then I started to think, and after some time, like 15-20 minutes, passed I realized something, or maybe I wanted to realize it. The spaceship was the movie’s way to tell us that the events or closures that we seek in our lives are not important. They are dull, and they won’t contribute anything to our mentality. The whole theme of the movie was to show us that our surroundings, our perception of our surroundings, and the time itself matters. As a result, it gave a dull, boring explanation for those who sought a “big closure”, a great explanation for the events. It said, “Yeah aliens did it or something.” to them. Dull. It didn't care about it, we didn't need to learn that. The \"alien explanation\" has no intrinsic value, same as almost any closure or \"answer\" that we seek in our daily lives. So, it worked as some kind of a “warning” for the ambition of pursuing a destination for both Jessica and the audience. At the end, the movie again showed that everything, every \"simple\" thing, in the nature and the world was awaiting us, so forget about the aliens and listen to it, life is easier that way.\n\nI am not sure if the director intended to imply such a message, nevertheless, I am looking forward to watching other movies of Apichatpong Weerasethakul, even just for their slow-paced delivery and artistry.",

        "text": "I’ve been listening through the Steven Benedict podcast based on a recommendation made in this sub ages ago, and during his episode on Who Framed Roger Rabbit, he clipped a quote from Richard Williams (the film’s director of animation):\n\n“That’s the rule with animation: you have to do what you can’t do with the camera. They knew that in 1905 - don’t ever do what a camera will do. Everything in animation should have an element of impossibility.”\n\nI’m curious what folks here this about this kind of prescriptive approach. This strikes me as one of the obvious benefits or attractions of animation (I’m thinking more so as a style than a tool used in an otherwise live-action film), but is there necessarily an *imperative* do something “impossible”? Does the use of animation as a visual or storytelling mechanism have to justify itself in this way? And if not, what does it mean to tell an otherwise “realistic” or “naturalistic” story using animation?\n\n(Also, if anyone hasn’t listened to Benedict’s podcast, I can’t say enough about what a treasure it is. I’ve been teaching film and writing film scholarship for over a decade, and his ability to cram insights and perspective into twelve-minute segments is astounding.)",

They seem to range from one compelling scene or performance to the next that is just too weirdly overacted or overwritten or overly improvised.\n\nThe kinetic, frantic style of these directors just didn't work for a number of scenes in these two films as opposed to some of their previous works. Maybe they weren't always the best dialogue writers or perhaps it's just some scenes in these films that were filmed, edited or acted in an unfitting manner.\n\nWhen I heard about the praise of this Babylon script back in 2019 I expected a much tighter film but some sequences were just too jumbled and overdone. The ones that work are just exceptional but i think he might've fallen for that mistake that some directors did by bloating their scripts due to the pandemic break that delayed their productions.\n\nI've come to notice a number in the industry and critics seem to respond more to those on set scenes as opposed to the debauchery of their party scenes which is curious whether they're exaggerated or not. But I bet they didn't even go far enough because they didn't reveal the assaults that took part in such parties.\n\nAll in all, they were both fun watches despite the sporadic scenes that are a 𝘨𝘪𝘢𝘯𝘵 𝘴𝘸𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘰𝘧 𝘮𝘦𝘥𝘪𝘰𝘤𝘳𝘪𝘵𝘺.",

        "text": "It could be childhood memories of my older sister letting me watch it when my parents were out. Could be that its a perfect time capsule of what it was like to be a teenager in the 1990's. Could be that it's just a really great movie in general. \n\nBut I think the reason why the first Scream has always stuck with me is because there's always been this greater underlying meaning and social commentary to it that the other Screams didn't have and quite honestly, most horror movies don't have in general. Let me take a stab at explaining it...\n\n**Disinterested/neglectful Parents**\n\nThis was a pretty common theme for Gen X and the movies made about them. Donnie Darko, American Beauty, Fight Club and probably a half dozen others made in the 90's. It's this lost, directionless generation raised by cold, disinterested parents. And the result is angst, anger, and ultimately violence in almost every movie mentioned. Scream is no exception. It's a lot more subtle for sure but I think it's an underlying comment.\n\n**Sydney**\\- Her mom was indeed no Sharon Stone. Screwed around on her dad pretty consistently with a complete disregard for how that would effect either of them/destroy their family if it was ever found out. We don't know for sure but I could guess that she probably wasn't around very much. Her dad, while he does seem to genuinely lover her, is implied to be out of town on business trips pretty consistently. \n\n**Billy**\\- This one's pretty straight forward. A father who screwed around (on his son's girlfriend's mom which is just straight fuckin weird in so many ways) and who clearly isn't involved in his son's life \"wait you went out last night?\". His mom left, understandably so, but I think its kind of implied that she cut ties with Billy too. And then she turned into a serial killer herself in the 2nd movie so you know she was also probably bat shit crazy to begin with as well. \n\n**Stu**\\- \"Two of your classmates were just slaughtered last night? Oh my goodness that's terrible!....Well anyways me and your father are gonna be in Hawaii for the week so lock up honey!\" Now you could argue that they were out of town before the murders started. But even still, who the hell leaves their 16-17 year kid alone in a super isolated house for a week? And again, I get the feeling that this was a pretty common occurrence, which is probably what led to Stu being so fucked up and out of touch with reality to begin with.\n\n**All the other kids** \n\nThere's a serial killer on the loose who within the past 72 hours has gutted 2 high schoolers, attacked/attempted to kill another, is pretty clearly targeting high school students/is most likely one of the students themselves and there's a city wide curfew for everybody. \"Yo mom I'm goin to a party at Stu's house! Don't wait up!\". \n\nThis to me is the movie making a pretty clear statement the kids in this town/generation. They're parents are unaware, uninterested, unengaged and most likely more focused on their careers than their families. And I think part of the reason why Billy and Stu ever became murderers in the first place is due to this. \n\n**Desensitized Generation Raised on Movies**\n\n*\"20 years ago I woulda said no way. But these kids today....Damned if I know\"*\n\nThis was another common theme that you saw in a lot of 90's. \"These damn kids today\". In Scream, their parents are too busy. They live in a safe little upper middle class suburban bubble. They have too much money. Too much time on their hands. And way too much freedom for how young they are. They grew up in the 80's and 90's, when movies and music were getting more and more violent each year. And with no parents to raise them properly, they took to movies to learn about life. \n\nI guess one of the reasons I found the original scream so interesting is that these killers who brutally butcher their friends, create this intricate yearlong murder spree and ultimately become two of the most infamous serial killers of all time are, at the end of the day, just kids. 2 upper middle-class 17 year old high school students from a quiet little Northern California town. \n\n**Super Rich Kids with Nothin But Fake Friends**\n\nThese aren't kids who were born to poor families in a Mafia-run neighborhood in Brooklyn or in a gangland ghetto in Detroit where they'd be exposed to drug crime and violence from a very young age. But ironically, I think it was this very lack of struggle, their sheltered lifestyle and maybe even just boredom that ended up making them so desensitized, and making a few of them ultra violent. \n\nBilly is without a doubt a psychopath, but Stu literally just did it for the lolz. Obviously they're both insane, but not to the extent that they don't know what they're doing. That being said it's pretty clear to me that Stu has absolutely no clue what kind of effect the murders he's committed really have on their loved ones. He looks at it like its all just \"one great big movie\", and in that sense he really is completely out of touch with reality. They even commit murders according to the \"rules of horror movies\" so it makes sense for the plot so to speak, which is real life to them. \n\nOf course we see this with Billy and Stu, but to a lesser extent, we see this with the other high schoolers as well. The whole school finds out that two of their classmates were ripped open the previous night, and a couple students think it would be just hysterical to run through the halls wearing the killer's costume as a prank. \n\nI mean picture this. You just found out about the brutal murder of two of your friends/acquaintances, and your response is \"Damn! I'm in the mood for a really good horror movie right now!\"\n\nYou just find out that the principle of your school was just found stabbed to death and hung by the goal post. Whether you liked him or not, the response to most people would still be horror and sadness. But not here, the high schoolers are actually so ecstatic about the news that they leave the party to go see him get cut down by the coroner for fun and are laughing and singing as they drive over. \n\nThere's a lot of little nods to this throughout the movie. The Sheriff talking about \"these kids today\". The principle reaming the two kids out and their \"entire whoring generation\".\n\nEven the song Youth of America playing as everyone shows up to the party. \"Say a prayer for the youth of America\" being one of the first lines we hear. In other words, **this whole generation is really fucked**.\n\nThis is what I love about the first Scream. It doesn't just implicate and accuse the actual killers themselves, but their entire generation. The movie at least to me, isn't just a straightforward \"whodunnit\" but a social comment on how that generation of kids were growing up and what it meant for society.\n\nAnd of course, the best part is that this whole movie is directed by Wes Craven, who helped establish the entire Slasher genre. I almost look at Scream as Wes's way of exhibiting some level of guilt over exposing the younger generations to extreme levels of violence and pondering the impacts it makes on society. And ironically enough, he's making this comment about slasher films while making another slasher film in the process. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnfortunately people tend to look at the first one as just a gimmicky horror movie from the 90's. Don't get me wrong, its not perfect by any means. But there's a lot more going than meets the eye I think.",

        "text": "“It’s All About Bucks, Kid. The Rest is Conversation.”\n\n\r  \nAnother season, another entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is the thirty-first entry into the franchise and, like at least the last twelve before it, does nothing to renew or revitalize the cinematic behemoth’s trite formula. Peyton Reed is back in the director’s chair, enthusiastically kowtowing to the demands of producers and ensuring there is no detectable sense of style or personal touch.\n\n\r  \nQuantumania plays like a cross between tediously scripted Saturday morning cartoon and embarrassingly generic Star Wars rip-off, evoking no sense of fun or wonder despite creative makeup, costuming, and digital landscapes. It’s utterly disposable and completely forgettable, but the theater was full at 3:00 pm on a Thursday, so silver lining, it will line some cultural overlords’ pockets with cash.\n\n\r  \nThe film follows Scott Lang and company as they’re sucked into the quantum realm, a land of mind-bending vistas and infinite possibilities. As Lang discovers the secrets of the realm and tries to protect his daughter Cassie, a new threat rises. Kang the Conqueror, one of Marvel’s most powerful villains, takes advantage of the newly available Pym Particles, enacting a savage plan to nebulously do something or another. The film also introduces M.O.D.O.K, immediately butchering his characterization and badassery.\n\n\r  \nThe MCU runs the gamut from inspired to miserably inept. Quantumania proudly slots into the center of the spectrum, not nearly as imaginative or well-crafted as Iron Man or Infinity War, but not as boring or portentous as Thor: The Dark World or Eternals. It squeezes so snugly into its predestined mediocrity that it’s difficult to scrape up thoughts which haven’t been said of any other MCU film from the last two years.\n\n\r  \nThe tone is still scatterbrained due to incessant quipping, the filmic craft is still laughably corporatized, the CGI is still creative and complex though horrendously fake-looking, the villain is still stripped of all complexity or intrigue, and the heroes are still indestructible paragons of status quo ubiquity.\n\n\r  \nSpecifically, Quantumania’s story unfolds sluggishly before kicking into hyper-speed. There’s hardly time for character introductions, let alone character growth. A few minutes’ stretch sets up a story of trust, subversion, and calculation, but is quickly bolled over for an overplayed, gratingly uninspired rebellion angle. By the time our characters are situated in this strange new world, the final act has started, and quickly becomes a typically rote slog.\n\n\r  \nNone of the performances elevate the film, though Paul Rudd is eminently likeable and Michael Douglas plays up to the stupidity of the material, charismatically smartassing his way through the adventure. Kathryn Newton is charming enough, Michelle Pfeiffer lends legitimacy to the inanity, and Evangeline Lilly…doesn’t really have much to do, honestly. \n\n\r  \nJonathan Majors is the disappointment of the cast, always just teetering on the verge of sobbing no matter the scene or context. Kang is an all-powerful force of destruction, but Majors plays him like he never left the set for The Last Black Man in San Francisco. He’s a great actor, but not an intimidator – he may have added thirty extra pounds of muscle to transform into a daunting presence in Creed III, but he didn’t here; all he has here is a cool-looking cloak.\n\n\r  \nWhat else is there to extrapolate after thirty previous entries? For perspective, the Bond franchise has been running for sixty years and just recently celebrated the twenty-fifth entry into its franchise, and where Bond has reasonably shifted its values, identity, and presence throughout several decades, the MCU continuously doubles down on its commitment to assembly line productions. \n\n\r  \nThe true shame is that, despite the staggering volume of the genre over the last twenty years, its context and potential for alteration (fundamental or superficial) has hardly been mined. Imagine a three-hour sweeping superhero epic, a dusty superhero western, or a psychological horror of superpowered insanity, all of varying budgets, tones, moods, styles, and complexity.\n\n\r  \nTake the thought further – hire legendary filmmakers like David Lynch, Paul Thomas Anderson, Darron Aronofsky, the Coen Brothers, David Fincher, or \\[your favorite filmmaker\\]. Sure, not everyone would go for the idea, but those who do would surely produce something of staggering ingenuity and creativity; the inexhaustible subtext of a superpowered world could be explored for decades, and these production companies have limitless resources to explore it.\n\n\r  \nAll a pipedream. Rather than force their audiences to grow up, Marvel and DC eagerly cater to their infantilized, developmentally arrested fanbases, slapping together content like Chinese day laborers, desperate to keep the dopamine perpetually dripping. Guardians of the Galaxy 3 will be here soon, The Marvels soon after that. \n\n\r  \nWriting this review was tedious enough; I cower to think of recording thoughts for MCU film number thirty-eight, number thirty-nine, forty, forty-one, onward and onward for eternity, until the Canadians invade, the dollar collapses, or The Living Tribunal is caught in a human trafficking scheme. Either way, blessed release.\n\n\r  \n4/9",

It is also known that he was considered for The Godfather, and The Leopard.\n\nI recently did a Post on Henry V and I enjoyed the movie and love the photography in the film and how Olivier directed the film. Hamlet is a film I am currently trying to watch and I think it is a complicated watch. I thought he was alright in Spartacus.\n\n Together with Richardson and Gielgud, Olivier was internationally recognized as one of the \"great trinity of theatrical knights\". Despite this, I've seen Many People these days don't take lightly to Oliver these days. Many call him a Ham or Over Acts in movie and many thought was not as good as Ralph Richardson and John Gielgud. I think why many people revered Olivier was the fact that Oliver preserves through Hard Work and Determination. This Quote said it all from William Redfield.\n\n\" Ironically enough, Laurence Olivier is less gifted than Marlon Brando. He is even less gifted than Richard Burton, Paul Scofield, Ralph Richardson and John Gielgud. But he is still the definitive actor of the twentieth century. Why? Because he wanted to be. His achievements are due to dedication, scholarship, practice, determination and courage. He is the bravest actor of our time\".\n\nControversial Opinion, I think Olivier was the British John Wayne, A Wooden Actor or Ham, but given the right material, can make things shines and never gives up.\n\nWhat do you think of Laurence Olivier?",

In addition, Spiderman 2, while not made by Marvel Studios, is my favorite comic book movie of all time.\n\nReasons why I think Avatar 2  is better than the recent MCU movies:\n\n1. Quaritch : Stephen Lang’s portrayal of this villain was excellent and I would even go as far to say it is one of the best \"bad guy\" performances in cinema history, behind Christoph Waltz as Hans Landa in Inglorious Bastards and a few others I can't think of off the top of my head. His line delivery and movements were good enough to steal the spotlight of any scene he's in. This contrasts with the bland and cliche Marvel villians.\n\n2. Plot: While the general premise of the movie was a bit weak, the rest of the plot is as good as it gets for a blockbuster movie, especially the whale subplot. A lot of the MCU movie plots feel copy-and-paste to me, not to say Avatar’s plot is perfect or anything.\n\n3. Groundbreaking Technology: This is a purely objective point, but the vfx in avatar completely blows marvel and Star Wars out of the water (no pun intended). Nothing in this movie feels fake which keeps me more immersed while watching it. \n\nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed the vast majority MCU movies, however, Avatar 2 is a superior movie to all of them in my opinion.",

Daveed Diggs, who is among my favorite rappers (I highly suggest watching \"Blood Of The Fang\", which is a music video that uses vampirism and makes references to historical and revolutionary black figures), gives a fantastic performance and he shows off some of his great rapping skills in this and Rafael is also great. For a film as comedic as this, it had some genuinely intense scenes where it left me on the shoes of the main protagonist trying not to get in trouble with the police and the justice system and how friends and those around you have a strong influence in your circumstances and choices. And I think it's also among the best critiques of systemic racism and police brutality. I appreciate it that it makes more nuanced by making the character to be indeed a felon that is perfectly justified in his fear that the police will discriminate him for his racial identity and also making the first victim of police victim as having a concealed weapon. Just because somebody committed a crime in the past doesn't justify nor hide the reality that the police is a violent, authoritarian organization as it exists today in the United States. To be around the police is to be at the risk of gaining the death sentence without a trial. But it also touches on the sensitive issue of how white people can behave \"black\" and also, how they cannot fully relate or experience the struggles of being a member of that group. And just watching at Miles feels like you are watching a ticking time bomb and you hope that he will not explode in anger.\n\nSuch a great ass movie.",

        "text": "Who is the best filmmaker still active today? Modern movies get a lot of stick for not being as good as some other era’s, and whilst that’s true in part, I still think there’s some wonderful directors who are still putting out fantastic work. Is Spielberg still your guy? Wes Anderson? Joachim Von Trier? Claire Denis?    \n     For me it’s probably Celine Sciamma. I think the last two pictures she put out will be heralded as absolute masterpieces for years to come. We already saw Portrait of a Lady on Fire feature in a high position on the Sight and Sound Poll (deservedly so imo) and Petite Maman is such a beautiful and poignant 70 minute ball of wonder.   As to possible contenders, I think, depending on his next project, Paul Thomas Anderson is still very much right up there (Phantom Thread really isn’t that long ago) and I still have great faith in Paolo Sorrentino’s genius. \n\nWho do you regard as the greatest artist in film today?",

        "text": "Spoiler Warning for Casino Royale and Mission: Impossible III\n\nI, as many others do, had chalked up the abrupt grittiness of Casino Royale and Mission Impossible 3 to the success of the Bourne Identity; however, after rewatching Bourne, Bond, and Mission Impossible in their entirety I think the claim gives the Bourne franchise far credit for the tonal change then it deserves. The Bourne Series cannot explain the newfound introspection, paranoia, and unprecedented nihilism seen in Mission Impossible 3 and Casino Royale like the loss of innocence after the 9/11 attacks can. \n\nI should note before I go any further that The Bourne Identity was written and shot pre-9/11, despite its 2002 release date. This negates an argument that 9/11 caused Bourne which caused CR and MI3. Bourne was a product of its own, as was any influence 9/11 caused - allowing thier legacies to be examined separately.\n\nLet's rewind a little. In a pre-9/11 world Mission Impossible and James Bond enter the 21st Century on an absurdist note, releasing Die Another Day and Mission Impossible 2, each infamously quintessential \"2000s\" action films. They each feature excessive slow-motion, awful CGI explosions, silly villains, a nonsensical premise, and an immature emphasis on \"coolness.\" The tagline of Die Another Day was \"He's never been cooler\" and MI2 is... well it's MI2. While Die Another Day took a Spy Kids route in contrast to MI2's Bollywood vibe, the manner in which the two franchises approached thier 21st Century debuts is undeniably similar. \n\nA few years later in 2006, CR and MI3 release six months apart, each featuring a never-before-seen dark tone for the franchise. They feature a new world where gamblers blow up planes for a side hustle only to be killed by their clients, where an arms dealer horrifically tortures innocents after laughing in the face of capture, and where all the hero's closest friends will stab them in the back if they don't kill them first. \n\nCR takes an introspective look, questioning the very existence of Bond himself and his purpose in this post-9/11 world. He's an obtuse egotistical blunt instrument with a license to kill. He kills an unarmed man at an embassy and proceeds to stop an airport bombing that was designed to do nothing but crash a stock. Bond is then betrayed by an ally and tortured by the villain - who isn't even killed by Bond, but by another greedy client of his. Bond is then betrayed again by the only woman he ever let his armor down for, and is then forced to watch as she drowns. After his experience, Bond finally concludes cynicism is his only key to survival. \n\n\"You don't trust anybody do you 007?\" - M  \n\"No.\" - Bond  \n\"Then you've learned your lesson.\" - M\n\nThe newfound self-awareness and hopelessness goes in tandem with the loss of innocence in the world.  \n\nMI3 features an even darker plot. Ethan Hunt successfully executes a run-of-the-mill operation to capture arms dealer Owen Davin. Owen laughs in the face of his capture, and calmly tells Ethan he's going to hunt down and kill his wife. Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Damian's nihilism is terrifying. Ethan is then betrayed by a trusted friend, Owen is released, and despite having no need, follows through on his promise to kidnap Ethan's wife. He tortures them both, even forces Ethan to watch his wife's (fabricated) death, and inserts a bomb into Ethan's brain. \n\nMI3 parrels Casino Royale in its cynicism. The protagonist's allies betray him. Villains commit horrific deeds without justification or remorse. The protagonist is forced to watch his loved one die in front of him. Nothing is glorified. Nothing is \"cool\" anymore. The films are a dunk into ice water when watching the franchises in order.\n\nAnd then... it eases off. 2008's Quantum of Solace is still gritty but the introspection and cynicism are toned way down. 2011's Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol is a complete tonal shift back to something more recognizable as a PG-13 action flick. \n\nThe tonal anomaly of MI3 and CR isn't because of Bourne. Bourne may be cynical, critical of the government, and frustrated with the existence of \"obtuse egotistical blunt instruments with a license to kill,\" but if you rewatch Bourne Identity, it's nearly a rom-com. Bourne is not a wholly broken man. His closest allies don't stab him in the back. The CIA villains, while still horrible, are rational in their thought and recognizable human beings. \n\nWhile the Bourne series undeniably had some influence on Bond and MI, the global loss of innocence is what ultimately made them embrace cynicism in thier post-9/11 debuts.  The complete rehaul between Die Another Die and MI2 compared to Casino Royale and MI3, and the fact this rehaul was consistent across the two franchises, perfectly encapsulates the effects the attacks had on the industry. I just find this historical little tidbit fascinating. \n\nThank you for coming to my Ted Talk. What do you guys think of the rise of film's like these and the Dark Knight in the mid-2000s?",

Yet when looking at these scenes from a distance, they show actions by the characters that are very trivial in nature. The suspense in these movies is not derived through fast editing, moody lighting or dramatic music, but rather by showing the viewer meticulous, well-planned efforts by the main characters, carried out step by step.\n\nAre there any others movies like this that you can recommend?",

        "text": "Let's kick that elephant out of the room first : I guess that any German film of the period could be tagged as *expressionist*. In this instance though, the décors were designed and built by the same artist as Dr Mabuse, so there's that. No distorted perspective here, even if some futuristic geometries do ring a bell. Now, the exagerated make-up, facial expressions and body language of the actors may seem par for the course in any movie of the 1920s but in here they have that \"not-kidding\" tinge that is, as far as I understand it, the hallmark of the much-touted, little-explained \"German-Expressionism\".\n\nI don't think that I'll spoil much of the fun by sketching some plot elements below.\n\nThe core tenet is that a random man discovers a secret that enables him to generate infinite electricity at no cost for him, giving him immense power on the rest of humanity. Which, of course, does not end well, hence the subtitle : \"Tragödie der Macht\", translated in English as \"The Tragedy of Power\", which is somewhat ironic since \"power\" is often used as shorthand for \"electrical energy\".\n\nBear in mind that this movie was released in 1920 : at that time, the prospect of atomic electricity \"too cheap to meter\" was not even thinkable except for a handful of theoritical physicists. A number of said physicists were German and I can't help but imagine that at some point there were some connections between theses and those screewriters. (I imagine late at night in [some cabaret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabaret_\\(1972_film\\)) in Berlin, à la [Babylon etc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon_Berlin)).\n\nThat was prescient too, or at least extremely well informed, is the dilemma wether abundant energy would free the workers or conversely enslave them further. Cue the \"specter that had been hauting Europe\" since that notorious Manifesto and that had started to materialise as the Bolshevick Revolution of October 1917 and even as the short-live Soviet Republic of Bavaria.\n\nIn the real-world geopolitical context of the period, the disrupting, abundant, cheap, monopolistic newfangled source of energy was of course not magical (or even atomic) electricity but indeed petroleum. With abundant deposits already discovered and drilled in the USA, and none in Europe, the balance of global power had already started to shift. Hence, maybe, the difuse malaise pervading said movie.\n\nAlso of note a part of the plot is that a neighbooring coutry finds itself an obligatory client of said magical electricity after it has depleted its coal deposits. IRL, peak coal was as early as 1900 for Great Britain.\n\nAnd oh, there are aliens too, coming from a planet supposedly orbiting the very real star [Algol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algol).\n\nIn the opening credits are explainations of how this movie was lost, and much later found, then restored.\n\nThis whole thing is now in the public domain and [available at archive.org](https://archive.org/details/algol-tragodie-der-macht-1920).

        "text": "I don’t quite know how to properly explain it, but here goes. \n\n\nThere is a scene in The Irishman where Jimmy Hoffa complains that Tony Pro turned up to a meeting in shorts, and it would seem pretty dumb for a grown man in a Scorsese film to be making such a complaint, but Pesci then snorts/laughs, with the film showing us here that he is more or less on the same page as us, and thinks this is ridiculous on some level.\n\n\nIn Goodfellas, after the famous Billy Batts beatdown, Pesci says to Henry “I didn’t want to get blood on your floor”, and a normal viewer would think “WTF of all the things he’s worried about in that moment it’s the cleanliness of the floor?!”, and Henry makes a face at Pesci that perfectly sells this expression. Again, the movie showing us it’s on our level.\n\n\nIn The Departed, a similar thing – the fight over the Cranberry juice crack, and after its all said and done Ray Winstone asks DiCaprio if he’s on is period. It’s kind of a dumb comment to repeat, but he holds the power in the situation so what can ya do? Maybe just raise your eyebrows, which is what DiCaprio does.\n\n\nI don’t know, it’s like the movies keep their morality relative to the temperament of the audience, knowing exactly what viewers will be thinking in a scene. The scene in The Irishman may have come off as goofy if Pesci hadn’t reacted the way he did, likewise The Departed scene. \n\n\nIs there a name for this?",

        "text": "What really impressed me about the movie is that the main character speaks very little, doesn't explain much about his motivations, you get no character background, you just watch what's happening. The character is just a completely average guy (apart from the fact that he's a hitman), he just looks and acts normal and average without any special quirks often used to create a sense of personality. \n\n\nBut in my opinion the director made this work perfectly, despite (or because) of all this. I was completely immersed in the plot and rooted for the character without having any special reason to do so. \n\nThrough very few elements and the ending you can get an idea of the character's code of ethics and even understand the final actions almost intuitively \n\n\nI also like how there are no romantic or sex scenes even though the character's actions among other things consider the interests of that girl. It's really great that the movie spared us a romantic subplot.\n\nThis really makes me think about how the director managed to achieve this, I think when done wrong this minimalistic approach could make the character seem boring and unrelatable to a lot of audiences who like more exposition, or make it hard for them to understand the character motivations and actions. But I think this movie completely succeeded in everything. \n\nAlso, I heard that the director wanted the guy to smile at the end when he kills himself but the actor already did that in one movie, so the director decided against it. I think it's much better this way.",

        "text": "So I just finished watching Amadeus last night (theatrical cut), and I really was blown away by the acting and how polished the movie was. I felt like I had a pretty good grasp on the obvious themes of the film (how jealousy and hatred can destroy someone), but I was still confused when it came to two parts: the symbolism of the sweets in the film, and the ending.\n\nIn the film, Salieri is shown to have a serious sweet tooth, and munches on treats throughout the movie, whether it be the “nipples of Venus”, the chocolate ball that he’s about to eat before Mozart and his girlfriend bust into the banquet hall, or the confection that the servants try to tempt him with in the beginning. In addition to all of this, Salieri’s father chokes on what appears to be sweets and paves the way for his son to finally study music. My question for you all is why do you think this was included? I figured that  Salieri’s appetite for sweets could be in part due to Salieri’s vows of celibacy and a need for an outlet for his indulgence, but I still feel as though I’m missing something. \n\nThe second part I’m a little confused on was the ending. In it, the old Salieri is wheeled around absolving the residents of the mental institution of their mediocrity, and Mozart’s ridiculous laugh rings out. Is this because Salieri feels as though he’s like the patron saint of mediocrity or something? And does Mozart’s laugh symbolically represent how he’s still haunted by jealousy and the memory of Mozart? I would love to hear any thoughts on this.",
