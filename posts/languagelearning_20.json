I would study many hours everyday for calculus or quantum mechanics, only to get a C- and barely pass the class.\n\nIn contrast I didn’t study for my final exam for German until 30 minutes before and I still got almost a perfect score.  \n\nI think one difference is that languages are generally formulaic.  You know the grammar and it’s mostly predictable.  For physics problems I had trouble “thinking outside of the box”.  If I could not use a formula to solve a problem I was completely stuck and could not even start.  \n\nDo any of you have a similar feeling? Foreign languages in general are easier than college level mathematics? The hardest languages in the world (Cherokee, Georgian, Arabic, Japanese etc) are easier to learn than the hardest graduate math/physics courses (like string theory, chaos theory etc).  Math requires more intuition and “intelligence” while languages are more straightforward?",

I'm at the stage now where I'm quite comfortable reading the Cyrillic alphabet and I can speak basic Russian. I think the reason why I love these two languages is because they have similar qualities that make them sound slightly similar. \n\nThings like the fact that they are both stressed timed, used closed vowels much more than open ones, use the dark \"L\" a lot and tend to use a \"sh\" sound where other languages would use \"s\". \n\nThe perfect word to describe my point is how both languages say the word \"school\" because its said nearly the exact same way. School in Portuguese is \"escola\" which is pronounced in European Portuguese like \"shkola\" and school in Russia is \"школа\" and pronounced \"shkola\" too. \n\nThese are both said with an \"sh\" (when most languages in Europe say it with an \"s\"), a closed \"o\", a dark \"L\" and a closed \"a\". \n\n(My apologies if these vowels aren't closed in every dialect but I have been taught that these letters are closed. You can understand my point regardless, the \"o\" and the \"a\" arent the same as the letters in Spanish for example.)\n\nIs there any reason why all of this qualities develop in the same languages while languages like Spanish and Italian includes almost if not any these qualities?",

        "author": "JakeWakefield",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/10w7is6/how_i_started_reading_german_literature_after_76/",
        "text": "After seeing a lot of posts and material about learning language X in Y number of months or Z number of years, I started tracking my language learning sessions for German. \n\nAfter all, someone who studies 5 hours a day versus someone who studies 1 hour a day will make different progress within Y number of months or Z number of years for a language.\n\nThis post is about how I started reading German literature for native speakers after 76 hours of study.\n\nJust a warning: Am I fluent in German? No. Do I understand everything? No. Am I reading actual German literature with the help of a dictionary now? Yes.\n\nTo be fair, I was not starting from absolute 0 with German when I began this. I had taken about 6 one hour tutoring sessions in high school for German before I stopped so I knew that German had 3 genders and I knew the accusative case was \"den\" for the masculine definite article but that's about as far as I got.\n\nFor my German study, I went through the Assimil German With Ease course from 1987, the German Without Toil course from the 1950s and then finally the newer Assimil German With Ease course from the 2000s.\n\nI also did flashcards on Anki from the \"German Sentences 2/3\" deck which is apparently a collection of sentences from Tatoeba. From the Anki records, I went through 11,899 cards out of the total 62,840 cards.\n\nSince I knew my goal was to read in German, I did zero listening practice and zero speaking practice. Even though the Assimil courses have audio, I barely listened to them and instead devoted the time to reading the lessons.\n\nThis worked out for me because I am able to learn much faster through visual comprehension than auditory comprehension. However, it also means that I am not practiced in listening to German or speaking it.\n\nAfter studying the three Assimil courses and the flashcards for 76 hours, I was going to do the Linguaphone German course but as I started to read the first lessons and go through the basics I had gone over 3 times already, I realized I couldn't take it anymore and decided to jump into literature.\n\nSince I am not a big fan of Harry Potter, I decided to start by reading \"Märchenmond\" by Wolfgang and Heike Hohlbein since it's a fantasy story and was also the work that launched Wolfgang Holhbein into becoming the top German fantasy writer.\n\nAs far as understanding the grammar went, I could understand all parts. There was no grammar that came up that I did not understand. \n\nThe vocabulary was a different story, however. I had to look up every other word.\n\nI used VocabTracker ([vocabtracker.com](https://vocabtracker.com)) which is an excellent tool. I imported each chapter into it and then used the pop up dictionary to look up the words by clicking on each word. This also stored the word and sentence it appeared in so that I could later export a csv file to import into Anki with cloze deletion flashcards that I have begun studying to increase my vocabulary.\n\nWhen I got to the end of Märchenmond, I could read a lot faster and understood a lot more without using the dictionary through the practice of having read so much. I was still looking up words, however.\n\nThe next book I decided to tackle was \"Die unendliche Geschichte\" by Michael Ende. I chose this book because it was also fantasy and was even adapted into a popular movie in 1984 (The NeverEnding Story).\n\nHowever, as I was halfway through, Professor Arguelles (whose Academy I attend) in the language learning support group suggested I join the German literature class. I am too busy to do this at the moment but he said they were reading \"Homo faber\" by Max Frisch. So I have started reading this book now.\n\nSince I want to join the German literature class eventually, I realized that I needed to improve my listening comprehension and speaking skills. I started listening to Easy German Podcast while I drive and after about 16 hours of listening to them, I can more or less understand them, although there is still a lot of vocabulary I don't know.\n\nAs for speaking practice, I have started summarizing what I read in \"Homo faber\" after I read it and then writing what I speak into a Google doc so I can later get the grammar corrected by a native speaker.\n\nI still have a long way to go in German but I am pleased with being able to read real German literature with the aid of a dictionary.\n\nMy plans from here are to continue practice summarizing my thoughts on Homo faber until I am able to speak well. I will study the flashcards I make from the vocabulary I get through using VocabTracker. I will continue to listen to German podcasts in the car. \n\nThen when my time is free again, I will join the German literature class at the language academy with Professor Arguelles.\n\nAlthough I started German relatively recently, I have been studying languages all my life. I have a somewhat high level in Spanish, French and Japanese and I actively study Chinese, Spanish, Korean, German and Arabic everyday at the moment. So I imagine this gave me an advantage in learning German, too.",

At times this has made English feel much less wordy in comparison, so I was curious if there are other languages that have seemingly endless verb-phrase constructions like English does.",

E.g. a native French speaker who knows some Spanish, Portuguese and Italian doesn't necessarily impresses me as much as a Brit speaking perfect Japanese.\n\nSo off the top of my head my top picks are:\n\n-Jodie Foster. Her French is literally native level. Not only her grammar, pronounciation, intonation, accent and flow are all perfect, but she also masters highly complex topics with a rich vocabulary that is actually superior to that of many French. Additionally, she speaks pretty decent Italian (beyond the usual \"I went to Italy once, I love Italia, pasta pizza\") and reportedly she's conversational in Spanish and German as well although I don't have any confirmation of this.\n\n-Alicia Vikander. Her English is possibly the most perfect I've ever heard from a non English person. Quite amusing.\n\n-Diane Kruger. Perfectly trilingual. Again, she isn't just \"pretty good\". Her French and English are just about native.\n\n-Julie Dreyfuss. In addition to being bilingual in French and English, any Westerner becoming so fluent in Japanese that *they're able to act in that language* deserves a medal.\n\n-Riche Faulkner, British musician from Judas Priest. Here's [a clip of him speaking Swedish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvV73G3vuIA). He learned the language pretty casually as a teen selling sausages on the street and playing music in venues, and decades later he's still fluent with a near perfect accent and pitch.",

While we may be dedicated enough for some self study we all prefer some sort of instruction. We are all US native English speakers.\n\nMy one friend has experience dealing with Berlitz however they are much more business focused, with the price to match, where as we intend to learn for more personal travel and culture consumption reasons. \n\nWe are not apposed to paying for classes but as we only have the view of business based language classes I am looking for some advice on potential alternatives. Right now for level 1 (out of 10 I believe Berlitz offers) 20 weeks of one 2 hour session a week with course materials would be about 1800 each. \n\nI have seen the resource guide and a lot of different discussion concerning classes but nothing that quite fit into what the 3 of us are looking for so I figured I would ask. All three of us work normal day jobs with some flexibility but can probably only do 2, 3 at the absolute most if well planned for, lessons a week. As the three of us are not local and we intend to take these lessons together an online lesson would obviously be preferred.  \n\nAs for budget we would like to keep it modest, Berlitz seems pricey but I don't have a good frame of reference. If that is what it takes then so be it. \n\nAny advice in this would be appreciated. Thank you!",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/10vp4w4/how_i_went_from_a1_to_c1_spanish_listeningreading/",
        "text": "I recently took the SIELE Spanish proficiency exam and received C1 in Listening/Reading along and came very close in Writing/Speaking (B2). Results [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spanish/comments/10vdj2g/almost_exactly_3_years_ago_i_started_spanish_101/). I didn't really prepare for the exam other than looking at the format the day before.\n\nI was fairly neurotic with tracking my input so I wanted to break down what it took for me to achieve this progress. Long post incoming so I've organized it with headers. Skip to what's relevant for you.\n\n# My Background\n\nI'm a senior in college and while I *technically* took Spanish in high school, I placed into my university's lowest level Spanish class so I started from scratch and very much needed to haha. That was 3 years ago (January 2020). After that semester, I took two Spanish classes that summer online through my university and continued to take Spanish classes until my last year in college. \n\nFor anyone curious about people learning multiple languages concurrently, I also started Arabic in college (my first semester) and am an Arabic major, so I started learning both languages from square 1 concurrently.\n\nI believe most of my growth after that first \\~9mo-year came from outside of the classroom, the classes felt more like a practice place than my main growth source. I never studied abroad, though I have spent about 5 (separate) weeks total in Spanish speaking countries over the last year just traveling.\n\nOriginally I did not focus on any one dialect, but after reaching around a low B2 level I decided to focus on rioplatense/porteño Spanish.\n\n\\-------------\n\n# Listening!\n\nFrom A0 to C1, I listened (podcasts, tv shows, movies, videos) to approximately **425 hours** of content. As I said in my background section, I wasn't really abroad for a significant amount of time, and believe most of my growth in listening came from this content. This is an approximate (but decently accurate) number made by analyzing my Netflix data, Spotify podcast data, Plex history, YT history etc.\n\nAs a general strategy, I preferred to watch television series over any other kind of listening content. I wasn't ever really a fan of things like Dreaming Spanish or other 'learner' focused content, personally. I began when I was a high A1/low A2 by watching Pokemon with Spanish audio and Spanish subtitles. Once I grew comfortable with a show/the difficulty, I would turn off the subtitles and get used to having just the audio as I grew. Then I would progress to a higher difficulty show, but back to Spanish audio + Spanish subtitles, but also have an easier show where I could just do audio. \n\nI would never use English subtitles in any of my listening/watching. I look up words occasionally but I try to keep it to a minimum so I can just enjoy the show. Animated shows are easier to understand than many \"live action\" shows, and the dubs of \"live action\" shows (like Stranger Things) are generally easier to understand than non-dubbed (clearer language, less colloquialisms).\n\nHere's some examples of the content I watched, graded by the approximate level that I consumed them at. In rough order of when I consumed them.\n\n*A2/B1ish*: Pokemon, Sword Art Online, 7 Deadly Sins, Neon Genesis Evangelion (2x), The Beginning, Death Note, Kakegurui, Parasyte (show), Jojo's, Attack on Titan, La Barrera.\n\n*B1/B2ish:* Stranger Things (dub), Ozark (dub), Rebelde, Control Z, Money Heist, Locked Up\n\n*B2/C1ish:* Millennials. El Marginal, La Cruda (podcast), YT channels like VisualPolitik.\n\nFrom my own self-estimates, I think it took me around**:**\n\n* **62 hours** to get to a B1 level of listening\n* **143** **more hours** to get to a low B2 level of listening (205 total)\n* **220 hours** more to reach the C1 level I have now (425 total)\n\nInterestingly, from B2 to C1 this is 10 more than the theoretical \\~205 I had calculated, as it's sometimes said that the path from B2 to C1 takes as long as A0-B2! \n\ntl;dr: **Use TL language, no english. Set a watch goal. Make a YT account just for your TL.**\n\n\\-------------\n\n# Reading!\n\nI've read approximately **9,124 pages** in Spanish to reach a C1 level. Inspired by [posts like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/n8y4td/spanish_reading_from_b2_to_a_solid_c1_via_50/), I set a reading goal in July to hit 10,000 pages to hit C1 but fell short by about 900. Still, in July I had only read 4,132 pages in Spanish, so I'm very happy to have averaged around 30 pages over that time and reached my goal of C1! I had a reading goal of 33 pages a day to hit my goal, and tracked it in an excel spreadsheet. \n\nThis does not take into account readings I had to do for Spanish class (except for the one novel we did read, which I did count), though those are all short stories or poems that won't add up to more than a couple hundred pages. \n\nIn terms of non-book reading, I read the news maybe once every two weeks for an hour, my phone is set to Spanish, and I am subbed to some Spanish language subreddits.\n\nMost of my recent reading was done on a Kindle, which was very helpful for the occasional looking up of vocab (and reading at night...), but I also got a lot of benefit when I was a \\~high B1/low B2 of having the physical book and *not* being able to easily lookup words, as it let me just keep going, enjoy the book, and learn from context. The books range from YA (El Alquimista, Aristotles y Dante) to literature (Bestiario, La insumisa) to pop science/politics (por qué dormimos, la cuestión palestina). I recommend reading on a wide variety of topics/styles to learn a wide variety of vocab.\n\nAll 38 books I've read to completion (in order, for the most part): Aura, El Alquimista, Veronika Decide Morir, La tregua, El túnel, Primavera con una esquina rota, gracias por el fuego, pedro páramo, la ciudad y los perros, La sombra del viento, El Aleph, Tengo miedo torero, historias de cronopios y de famas, las batallas en el desierto, el psicoanalista, adultério, Aristóteles y Dante se sumergen en las aguas del mundo, las cosas que perdimos en el fuego, La insumisa, Stamped: el racismo el antirracismo y tú, Cuentos de amor de locura y de muerte, te daría el sol, pedro y el capitán, guia del autoestopista galáctico, bestiario, por qué dormimos, la ley de la ferocidad, Qué es el peronismo? De peron a los kirchner, la metamorfosis, Las malas, la cuestión palestina, la borra del café, Siria: revolución sectarismo y yihad, 1984, boquitas pintadas, el beso de la mujer araña, Yo Robot, del tiempo y sus demonios.\n\nApologies for formatting, I would've done a bulleted list but it would've made this post even longer...\n\n# Speaking\n\nI was [9 points away](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spanish/comments/10vdj2g/almost_exactly_3_years_ago_i_started_spanish_101/) from C1 speaking, a shame! But this was to be expected, I didn't practice speaking that much, but I'll write out what I *did* do in case it could help someone. I don't speak much Spanish in my daily life, but my boyfriend speaks at around a B2 level and we chat maybe once every two weeks for an hour. I've had 8 iTalki meetings, and before this school year I had regular Spanish classes where I got to practice speaking occasionally. \n\nI improved my accent by posting audio recordings to HelloTalk and asked natives to roast it. Super helpful.\n\nI've traveled to Spain (Madrid 1week, Barcelona 1week), Uruguay (Montevideo 2w), and Mexico (CDMX 1w), and while I was there I would only speak in Spanish to people not in my group which got me some practice and confidence, but most of my time was spent talking to my (english speaking) friends there, so they weren't quite transformative experiences.\n\nI've spent maybe 10 hours total on some VrChat Spanish-speaking worlds, honestly very helpful. Very slangy language but really funny sometimes and helps simulate immersion in a less stressful environment.\n\nI try to talk to myself often in Spanish, which is where I think a lot of my growth comes from. Daily, I'll narrate my life and thoughts in Spanish, often my discussions with myself in the shower are in Spanish. I'll practice giving my (English) school presentations in Spanish for fun, and recently have started pulling up random topic generators just to riff about.\n\nI plan on joining more Spanish speaking communities online where I can practice speaking more, as well as doing some iTalki so I can cross that C1 threshold.\n\n# Writing\n\nWriting was my weakest skill (still a strong B2, though), which didn't surprise me as I don't really write much. I used to write more when I was in Spanish class and received good feedback on my essays, but aside from that most of my writing experience just comes from either journalling or note taking. Often, when I'm bored in a (non-Spanish) class I will take my notes in Spanish to keep me more engaged, and this is helpful for identifying vocab weakpoints. I journal occasionally but not super often, but it's also helpful for identifying weakpoints. I'm of the opinion that to be a good writer you have to be a voracious reader, and I think that's how I was able to achieve relatively high level despite relatively way less time spent on the skill.\n\nMy plan is to amp up my journaling/notetaking, but honestly it's not my highest priority skill. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#  Ask me anything below!",

Our club is starting up our English lessons for the semester again, so I figured I would share this this message.\n\nWe are a group of college students at the University of North Carolina. We are a club where we teach English to those interested in learning. If you are interested in free English conversation practice, you can fill out this form to sign up for our email list and get more information/updates. [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe\\_TXW2GzANKLUC61PIXRKsxhulBbqQ7PejwZzcOOyCw91OSw/viewform?usp=sf\\_link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe_TXW2GzANKLUC61PIXRKsxhulBbqQ7PejwZzcOOyCw91OSw/viewform?usp=sf_link). We tend to break out into groups and practice conversation with each other so that everyone gets the chance to practice and learn in small groups. It is pretty informal, and we do things from casual conversation practice to grammar lessons to reading and comprehension. We will be meeting twice a week on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 7-8pm EDT on zoom. Feel free to come and test it out on either of the days. We are fine with any level of English, but we prefer at least an intermediate level. Feel free to message me if you have any questions.\n\nHope to see some of you at the next meeting!",

        "text": "Hi! So I have grapheme-color synesthesia, where I see/associate colors strongly with letters and numbers, and most of the time a word is a color that's a smushed-together equivalent of all its letters. I've always found it very helpful with spelling in general, but I wasn't sure how it would transfer, if at all, to learning new writing systems as an adult.   \nHowever, I've been learning Japanese on-and-off for over a year now, and definitely am now getting colors for kana and some kanji. I'm really curious if there's other grapheme-color synesthetes here who have studied a language with a different way of writing than your native language, and if so, did you get colors? At what point did you start to get them? Were there any patterns you noticed?  \n\n\nFor me, I've noticed:\n\n* Most kana have a color similar to either the consonant their romaji spelling starts with, or to a letter or number that their appearance reminds me of. For example, all the N group kana are strongly shades of red-oranges, which is the color N is for me, but the various shades of the N group kana don't correspond to the second letter in the romaji spelling. For example, の and ノ are not the same shade as the English word \"no,\" even though that's how they're pronounced and spelled in romaji.\n* In the Latin alphabet, capital letters are usually a darker or more saturated shade of the same basic color as their lowercase equivalent, but katakana and hiragana are not as likely to match. This made it significantly harder to memorize some of them. For example, よ (yo) is a shade of yellow, which the color Y is for me, but ヨ (also yo) is the same green as a capital E.\n* Some kana and kanji are seemingly influenced by the color of another one that I learned first. For example, despite \"h\" being a soft red for me, ほ (ho) is a purple/periwinkle, and I think that's because ま (ma) is strongly purple for me, and both the number 1 and the letter I are a soft pale blue, and it looks kind of like \"Iま\" \n* Diacritics are closer to working like capital/lowercase does in Latin script. For example, \"k\" is a bright yellow-orange, and \"g\" is a mild greenish-gray. But が  (ga) is a darker version of か (ka), more similar to how a capital K would be in English. \n* On the other hand, small versions of kana are the same as the big versions, just... smaller.\n* Kanji are all over the place. Most that I don't know don't have colors (yet?), but some randomly do. Even for kanji I know, they can have colors that don't have a clear reason behind them, or have colors that correspond to a romaji reading of them, or to something else they look like (ex. 七 is the color of セ rather than colored like 7, nana, or shichi), or to an English *translation* of what they mean (ex. 中 is the color of the word \"in,\") seriously there's not really a pattern.\n\nHopefully someone else finds this as interesting as I do! Let me know if you have anything to share!",

I was able to teach some Spanish and my partners did a good job at trying to teach and practice English with me.\n\nI then finally switch to Russian as a target language and the whole app turned into crap. Nobody ever texts me nor do they reply when I text them. The few times I somehow get something going they refuse to send audio/call and the whole convo is basic/dry and one sided with me teaching them and they returning back as little as possible. \n\nI switched my target language into something thing more popular and easier like French or Italian and it was more or less the same experience as Russian but not as bad.\n\nNgl I was eager to meet new cultures and learn some new words. But now I feel like im leaving the app with a newfound xenophobia and racism that was not there before in my heart. The English/Spanish speakers are so kind and helpful and everyone else is so selfish and useless. My 2 cents.",

However, there is a problem in that I have to \"wake them up\" in my mind, \"warm them up\", and for some reason I cannot keep them \"active\" in my mind at the same time.\n\nWhat I mean by this is that when I am talking to someone in French, Polish words keep popping up in my head and want to jump off my tongue. After a few days the problem subsides, but when I go back to Polish the same thing happens and French words keep coming up. It is really annoying and makes me reluctant to actively improve any of them. I am even afraid to learn a new language at this point, even though I would like to (because it has led me to believe that I do not have an open 'slot' for new languages in my mind). \n\nThe problem only occurs when speaking, not when listening, and - as far as I can tell - is limited to vocabulary (no problems with grammar). \n\nAbout the context: I acquired French at school (7 years) and Polish (after a totally unhelpful and discouraging A1 course) just by listening and talking to Polish family and friends, gradually picking up more and more along the way (basically ignoring grammar, but picking up the main cases &amp; declinations anyway).\n\nAre any of you familiar with this problem? Have you found a way to solve it? Do you have any explanation of how it works?",

        "text": "Hey All, I posted this 500 hour update a few months ago ([https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/ylc228/update\\_500\\_hours\\_learning\\_spanish\\_through\\_anki/](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/ylc228/update_500_hours_learning_spanish_through_anki/)) and since I just hit 750 hours, I figured I would post another quick update with my progress. \n\n*Soft  disclaimer: I didn't start tracking hours in the very beginning so I  don't have* ***exact*** *time numbers for some elements of this, but when I went  through and added everything up to the best of my abilities, I am at or  a little bit over 750 hours. Also, this doesn't include passive input  like having an audiobook playing while getting groceries where I was  barely listening to it.*\n\n**Hours breakdown:**\n\nDreaming Spanish: \\~282 hours  \nAnki/srs: \\~87.65h  \nMovies/TV Shows/youtube: \\~273 hours  \nReading: \\~75 hours  \nCrosstalk: \\~32 hours\n\n(Background: if you are interested, I talk about my background with spanish learning in the 500 hour update post!)\n\n**Changes over last 3 months:** \n\nOver the last 3 months, I have continued to focus on getting as much immersion as I can but have been doing a lot more reading than I had been doing before. I mostly waited to start reading until I felt like I had a decent grasp on how the language sounded so I wouldn't subvocalize with the wrong sounds and feel like I got there. I have been reading a lot of graded readers (thank you Paco Ardit!), news articles, and video transcripts from educational youtube channels like CuriosaMente with the audio playing. I've also found that I go through phases with Dreaming Spanish where I will alternate between consuming lots of DS and between consuming lots of movies/TV shows. I don't know if I do that because of the variety or what but I've been enjoying it.\n\nI've also gotten a lot better at pure listening comprehension without any visual aids. For instance, in the mornings while getting ready, I will usually put on a news podcast and listen to it without too much difficulty. \n\nI've continued doing Anki and am enjoying it but when the new cards run out of my deck next week, I think I might stop adding and focus more on just reviewing sentences in clozemaster (while still doing the anki reviews, of course) \n\nI've also continued doing crosstalk once or twice a week for 30 minutes to an hour and have found it really helpful. \n\n**Where I'm at:**\n\nShort  answer: Right now, if I HAD to guess, I would estimate that I am at B1.\n\nLong answer: The difference in comprehension in reading and listening and watching from 500 hours to 750 hours has been very interesting. When I rewatch something that I felt like I was able to mostly understand, I just feel like I understand it better. It feels like looking at something without my glasses and then putting them on- I understood it decently enough before but now am starting to see shades and just understand it more deeply. I also am getting to a point where I am much better at noticing things like accents and typos and when a native speaker says something incorrectly but then corrects themselves quickly, which pretty much all went right over my head 3 months ago. I am also getting a lot better at recognizing and noticing different grammatical structures that didn't really make sense to me before and feel like I am developing an intuition for what 'feels' right.\n\nUsing DS videos as a metric, I can watch every Super beginner and beginner video with complete understanding (and, if I am watching them, I usually put the video at 1.5/2x speed) \n\nI can watch pretty much every intermediate video with *at least* 90%-95% comprehension depending on the topic and can understand almost all of all of the advanced videos I have watched. However, there have been a few advanced videos that I felt took a little too much energy and focus, so I just marked them as not-watched and am saving them for later. \n\nOutput: I really haven't done much output at this point. However, there have been a few instances where I've needed to and felt a LOT more comfortable than I did before. A month or so ago, my landlord sent a few contractors to make some repairs in my apartment, and they only spoke spanish. I was able to talk with them, introduce myself, answer some questions about the repairs that needed to be done, offer them coffee, etc. Of course, I still made a ton of mistakes but I'm totally fine with that. I was able to understand them decently well when they were talking to me, but couldn't understand them when they were talking to each other. \n\nI've also had a few meetings with one of my crosstalk partners where we didn't do crosstalk but just a traditional language exchange. Again, I made a ton of mistakes of course, but feel way more comfortable than I did a few months ago and feel like I can speak and converse on topics that are outside the basics/salutations/etc. \n\n**My Thoughts/Goals:**\n\nI feel like the changes in the past few months have been a lot more subtle than they were from 0 hours to 250 hours and 250 hours to 500 hours, but that subtlety has felt extremely rewarding. I feel like I am developing a better 'feel' for the language and totally get what people mean when they say the time from each CEFR level to the next is exponential. haha \n\nFor the future, I think I am just going to keep doing what I am doing. I have been thinking about maybe signing up for the DELE B2 exam but haven't made any real plans with that yet. Either way, just wanted to give y'all an update for future people considering learning mostly with immersion! \n\nThanks for taking the time to read this! I hope it can be helpful or interesting.\n\nIf you have any questions, I'm happy to try to answer them!",

I'm not taking any medicine (personal reasons) but I am wondering what I can do to more effectively learn languages.im trying to learn Spanish. Both my parents are fluent and I've been exposed to it my entire life. I have never been able to fully grasp it. I know a ton of vocab. I can almost always understand when someone talks to me (depending on where they are from. Accents and variations sometimes makes it difficult.) I can read but kinda like a little kid lol. I know i need to just sit down and practice but every time I do I end up doing something else. I've bought tons of books to help but idk. What can I do to force myself to practice? Or trick myself into practicing. Thank you.",

I'm kind of between an A2 and B1 now and will continue studying. But I also want to learn French and Japanese. \n\nI think my plan moving forward will be a combination of Pimsleur, Lingoda, Yabla, and Duolingo to start with. There are also podcasts and YouTube resources, but I want to focus on using the four programs I'm paying for first lol\n\n**My first plan/idea**\n\nMorning Before Work: \n\n\\- 1 Pimsleur lesson (either French or Spanish) (30 minutes)\n\n\\- 15 Minutes daily on Duolingo (for either Spanish and French, immediately after the Pimsleur lesson)\n\n\\- 15 Minutes daily of Yabla (for either Spanish and French, depending on the Pimsleur lesson I've chosen)\n\nAfternoon Work Break: \n\n\\- 1 Pimsleur lesson (either French or Spanish) (30 minutes)\n\n\\- 15 Minutes daily on Duolingo (for either Spanish and French, immediately after the Pimsleur lesson)\n\n\\- 15 Minutes daily of Yabla (for either Spanish and French, depending on the Pimsleur lesson I've chosen)\n\nEvening After Work: \n\n\\-  30 minutes learning Japanese characters on Duolingo\n\n\\- \\*On weekends will do 1 hour for Japanese on Duolingo, opposed to French and Spanish\n\nThe problem here is fitting in Lingoda Spanish classes. It may just be whenever I can fit them into my schedule. I debate which is better sometimes - timed repetition on Pimsleur even though it's more beginner level (I think going back to basics can cover things I've skimmed over) OR Lingoda because it's all in Spanish and there's a lot of talking and listening to real people. Probably the latter, in which case...\n\n**Second Idea**\n\nTry hard to do Lingoda for Spanish most days per week, and leave Pimsleur and Duolingo to French and Japanese as primary practice and just using Duolingo Spanish as a game and additional touchpoint throughout the week. I think Yabla is still a good resource for Spanish though. \n\nSo one of the time slots in the day would just be Lingoda and Yabla for Spanish. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\----\n\nWhat do you think of my plan? Any advice? I'm trying to make it not overwhelming, but also want to make some progress in each language.",

I also realized that my Italian output is severely lacking.\n\nWhat I would want to do is to add an Italian output activity to my schedule, and maybe try to do some creative writing in Spanish to improve that one too. Haitian Creole, I simply use it with my coworkers, and while I would need better resources to really improve, it is really not a priority for now. I usually got by by doing a lot of input while I am in transit, walk or work, but that is not sufficient if I want to practice output or seriously.\n\nWhat I am looking for with this post, other than much needed encouragement, are ways to practice output that are not too taxing, or other activities that might be helpful. Just discussing your own experiences is fine too!",
