If so this would undermine the common argument that the existence of systematicity favours the language of thought hypothesis over connectionism.\n\nIs there any research that has been done on this?",

The Rabbis point to the imagery of a bull raking the farm but gets injured, and instead a horse takes his place for the time being.

        "text": "I  think it's a very common intuition in western society to think incest is ethically problematic, but I never really dove very deeply into the why of it, the first time I had someone argue incest was etically okay I didn't know how to respond, but I  think it's important to have a good foundation for why we think what we  do, after looking into to it for a bit, I think I understood why that was the case, but I would appreciate feedback to see if my thoughts and these arguments I have encountered are really solid, if there is a flaw in this logic I would precariat the feedback ;)\n\nfirst, let's address that it is still common in some places of the world but that doesn't make it right\n\nyes  it's common in certain cultures  and was more common in the past, but  it's still a practice that is  looked down upon in numerous amount of  places in the world, even the  ones where it is legal, there is a reason  why a lot of countries banes  it, it is socially tabu and a  controversial topic, and even in  most countries where it is not illegal  it is still tabu for most of these societies\n\ncousin marriages are legal in some states in the US and its tabu over there\n\ncousin marriages are legal in Canada and it's tabu over there\n\ncousin marriages are legal in brazil and it's tabu over here\n\nand cousin marriages are legal in japan and it's tabu over there ([that's why it's been declining in recent years](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/10642433_Consanguineous_marriage_and_childhood_health))\n\nthere   are reasons why cousin marriages are considerably rare in most of the   world and appear to be declining in most of the world\n\n*-yes  there is the genetic problem, but that's not even the main one, yes   it's a bit riskier, but it only becomes a huge problem when it's a  recurring event in a family tree*\n\n*-but   the thing is that genetic problems are not the only reason people are   not fans of cousin marriages (though the fact that in large scales  cause  problems do contribute to a cumulative case it shouldn't be  encouraged by society)*\n\n*-cousin  marriages may have problems with power dynamics because of the family   structure and the respective position of both parties*\n\n*-cousin  romantic relationships have a bigger likelihood of causing fallouts   between families in a kind of snowball effect if there are big fights   between the couple (which are common for couples)*\n\n*-several  religions prohibited it, and even if you don't think that's a valid  argument it does contribute to making the practice tabu in many   cultures (this one is not a moral argument, it's just part of the  historical justification of the way incest is tabu, that I tough would  be dishonest not to include in the list of why the most people in the  west are not okay with incest*\n\n*considering  all that, it  is natural for cousin marriages to slowly become rarer  and more tabu,  especially since the whole reason it was so popular in  the past was to  preserve political power and because of convenience and  lack of other  options in small communities (*[*even today convenience and lack of options is one off the most common reasons for the practice*](https://web.archive.org/web/20080531165818/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,250060,00.html)*)*\n\n**I  don't think any of these arguments would apply to discourage gay marriage, or old people marrying or re-marrying (increased chance of problems when an older woman gets pregnant), or childless couples. I am  =not saying society should get to dictate couples based on the utility of children to society.**\n\nthose  are not nearly the same situation judging old people, gay people,   divorced people, infertile people, or childless people could put a  severe mental strain on something they can't avoid and that can  happen to anyone, while the societal backlash to inter cousin marriages  comes from taking genetic and social risks that would not even be  present if the person approached other romantic options that would be less troublesome for you and everyone involved (and I  wasn't saying we should ban the practice since I agree the government  shouldn't decide who marries who, I was only defending it is immoral and is a justifiable social tabu that shouldn't be socially encouraged)\n\n**So based on that, I do think genetic problems are not the only reason people are not fans of cousin marriages**\n\nhere is some objections I have gotten from this argument and my answers to them\n\n&gt;Most of that boils down to \"may have problems\" which is nor really  immoral or gross.\n\nThe same can be said for interfaith couples, age gap couples, wealth or education disparity couples, and so on. It can be normal for some   relationships to both be more likely to lead to problems and yet be   completely fine for a couple of consenting adults\n\nthat's   a completely false dichotomy, I was making a cumulative case that   cousin marriages which have a higher likelihood to cause problems and   should be discouraged, but there is no reason to assume that one single   characteristic alone makes cousin marriages equivalent to the various   examples you listed\n\nI do think   it's entirely valid to certain religious communities to discourage   conflict in interfaith marriages, but that tabu is far from as  widespread as the negative fame of incest, and there are good motives  for that, not only does it have less likely inherent  risks (like it  doesn't have the built-in power dynamics incest has), it also  contributes to intercultural exposure and communication which is   commonly viewed as a positive and moral trait by many societies\n\nthe   same thing applies to wealth gap and education gap relationships, it   encourages intercultural exchange and dialogue, not to mention these two   particular ones also promote social mobility to the couple's offspring   which is a plus, it isn't a coincidence these examples are less tabu   then incestuous relationships, they have less downsizes and more   benefits\n\nand regarding the age gap   example is more useful for my argument than for yours being hones, I   mean certain age gaps are one of the most recurrent features people say   can be \"red flags\", that is not to say it can't work (I myself am a   child of a couple with 10 year age gap that have been a happily married   couple off more than 20 years that) but there is still a reason it is a   common tabu, depending on the age gap it can be a very big red flag  that  includes a series of possible toxic traits built in (power  dinamics and  the like) relationships, in general, are a case by case  bases, but  expecting society not to produce backlash to general  examples of things  it considers harmful is not realistic or even a good  idea, a society  pasive to things it thinks are bad would not be helty  (or are we going  to act like being nonjudgmental to relationships  between a 14-year-old  and a 17-year-old just because it's legal would  be okay and not a  complete case of societal negligence just because it  has the super rare  possibility off being completely helty)\n\n&gt;people  to know the stakes and to decide they're going through with their  relationship anyway.The  whole shitty tendency of wholesale judging  \"couples that are more  likely to have problems are gross and illegal\"  is really annoying and  gross,\n\nI   am not even arguing it should be illegal, because that is something   which can be argued would be immoral to ban via juridical means with   stronger arguments, but acting like society judging it as an immoral   thing is not positive but harmful is completely backward, yes societal   norms are not inherently good, but in many cases, they do serve to   encourage optimal or moral behaviors\n\nI   mean I don't want to be mean, but I really don't see your point, I do   think discouraging activities that have a high chance of being harmful   and are also completely unnecessary in most cases, tend to be a moral  action  for society to take even if it's not a judiciary law\n\nif you guys have anything to add it would be welcomed, and thanks for reading everything, and if you didn't the **tl;dr** is:\n\nincest can cause genetic problems\n\nincest  also has common and likely built-in power dynamics in many cases  because of the previously reestablished relationship and the different  standing in both in their shared social group of the \"familly\"\n\nit can cause a big impact on family relationships causing fallouts\n\nis an easily avoidable practice not worth the risk involved\n\ntherefore society should discourage the practice to reduce the occurrences and their negative consequences\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthat's basically it, if you guys could offer feedback correcting an invalid argument or adding one I missed I would appreciate it",

        "text": "David Lewis was one of the most influential philosophers in the late twentieth century who had a tremendous impact upon metaphysics. He is most famous for defending his radical metaphysical view of reality known as modal realism. However, he also is seen as the main proponent of a type of metaphysics referred to as “neo-Humean metaphysics” and this is apparently summed up with his concept and idea known as Humean Supervenience. Lewis famously said to describe this is that “all there is to the world is a vast mosaic of local matters of particular fact, just one little thing and another”. This appears to be a form of ontological atomism (or metaphysical reductionism). Atomism is the metaphysical framework which holds that the world is not an indivisible whole, but rather, is made up of and reducible to its parts — that the world is an aggregate of parts. This is contrasted with metaphysical holism which is a metaphysical framework which holds that the world is a single, indivisible whole, not reducible to the sum of its parts.\n\nI am very new to studying metaphysics and especially the work of modern day metaphysicians. This sounds extremely complicated and abstract to me and I am having difficulty breaking it down and understanding it clearly. I was therefore hoping can someone simply explain what exactly is David Lewis’ Humean Supervenience/neo-Humean mosaic? \n\nIn addition, I was wondering what are some good arguments against Humean Supervenience/neo-Humean mosaic? These can be arguments which are more philosophically motivated (a priori) or even scientifically motivated (a posteriori). The reason why I even ask about it scientifically is because with some of my research there is a claim that Humean Supervenience fits nicely into a classical/Newtonian physics view of reality, but with the advent of quantum physics, this has apparently cast evidential doubt upon the neo-Humean mosaic (for some reason I am not exactly aware of). \n\nSo, overall, is the so-called neo-Humean mosaic a philosophically and or scientifically plausible metaphysical model for the physical world? Further links or readings for me to do further research into is fine too. Thanks everyone 👍🏻",

But if we grant that 1) it is good for humanity to continue existing and 2) people younger than you have to exist to care for you in your old age (either directly by working in the healthcare system or indirectly by keeping the Medicare and social security payments flowing), then presumably we must believe that *someone* is morally obliged to have children.

A Chinese room might be capable of machine translation, or following instructions within one human language, but the task here is so self-evidently outside the training set, and so convoluted, that is requires genuine understanding.

Because it is forgetting irrelevant details. There is another term for this: abstraction. It is forming concepts. There comes a point in the performance to model size curve where the simpler hypothesis has to be that the model really does understand what it is saying, and we have clearly passed it.\"\n\nAny comments or critiques?

For that very reason, it is fitting that he have primary say over what may be done to them—not because such an arrangement best promotes overall human welfare, but because any arrangement that denied him that say would be a grave indignity.

They throng about the captain, begging and praying him to commit the helm to them; and if at anytime they do not prevail, but others are preferred to them, they kill the others or throw them overboard, and having first chained up the noble captains senses with drink or some narcotic drug, they mutiny and take possession of the ship and make free with the stores; thus, eating and drinking, they proceed in their voyage on such a manner as might be expected of them. Him who is their partisan and clearly aids them in their plot to for getting the ship out of the captains hand into their own whether by force or persuasion, they compliment with the name of sailor, pilot, able seaman, and abuse the other sort of man, whom they call a good-for-nothing; but that the true pilot must pay attention to the year and seasons and sky and stars and winds, and whatever else belongs to his art, if he intends to be really qualified for the command of the ship, and that he must and will be the steerer, whether other people like or not-the possibility of this union of authority with the steerers art has never seriously entered into their thoughts or been made part of their calling. Now in vessels which are in the state of mutiny and by sailors who are mutineers, how will the true pilot be regarded? Will he not be called by them a prater, a stargazer, a good-for-nothing?",

        "text": "I am trying to write up an analysis of controversial philosophy papers in the analytic tradition that have elicited considerable blowback either from the lay public (usual outcome) or from philosophers (more unusual). One of the goals of the project is to examine if the authors of such papers have failed to prophylactically immunize themselves against reasonably foreseeable backlash through poor framing, needlessly purulent/grotesque examples, etc. or if the actual conclusions, even carefully presented, are simply inherently or intuitively controversial. The controversy in these papers tends to be of the socially-relevant or justice-oriented variety. \n\nObviously, the *Journal of Controversial Ideas* exists but it is both very new and too explicitly centered on controversy to be relevant to this inquiry. I am aware of the obvious examples which I will provide below to give you the flavor of what I am looking for, but I would like to have at least **five or ten additional papers** to incorporate. \n\nAn obvious recent example is Rebecca Tuvel's 2017 paper [*In Defense of Transracialism*](https://philarchive.org/rec/TUVIDO) wherein she argues that since we should accept transgender identification, we should also accept transracial identification for analogous reasons. Alberto Giubilini &amp; Francesca Minerva ignited a firestorm with their paper [*After-birth abortion: why should the baby live?*](https://philpapers.org/rec/GIUAAW) wherein they argue that neither fetuses nor newborns have the moral status of actual persons, potential personhood is morally irrelevant, and since adoption is not always an option, ‘after-birth abortion’ (killing a newborn) should be permissible in all the cases where abortion is permissible, including cases where the newborn is not disabled. \n\nBasically any Stephen Kershnar paper is going to qualify, be it one arguing [in defense of Asian romantic preference](https://philpapers.org/rec/KERIDO-3), that [nonforcible adult-child sex is often not morally wrong](https://philpapers.org/rec/KERTMS), the one where he gives a [liberal argument for slavery](https://philpapers.org/rec/KERALA), and [for discrimination against women](https://philpapers.org/rec/KERFDA). He also has a book length treatment of abortion wherein he argues that Christian theists that hold conventional theological beliefs should find abortion to be morally obligatory since the ensouled fetus is guaranteed an infinitely good afterlife in heaven because the Christian God is an all-good/morally perfect being and that is the only place such a being could send a fetus' soul. \n\nLikewise, infamous Peter Singer papers about bestiality, infanticide, and speciesism. These are all the *kinds* of papers that I am looking for rather than papers by e.g. Frank Jackson, Thomas Nagel, or Daniel Dennett where a philosophically controversial conclusion is reached but it fails to enter the broader social conversation or touch issues of justice and/or fairness. \n\nI'd be grateful any assistance in locating other similar kinds of papers.",

        "text": "Recently read on wikipedia an article about Beauty briefly explaining Jaspers philosophy, however there weren't any sources and I'm wondering from which book it is (sorry for the bad translation of the article) :\n\n\"According to him, beauty applies in fact to two different dualities: that of primary being (dead matter) versus complex being (individual), then to the natural duality of substance versus form. [ref.  necessary]\n\n For the first duality, we can summarize by saying, simply, that the beauty of simple beings (scenery, landscapes) is called the ambiance, the atmosphere they give off.  As for the beauty of a complex being, for example a human being, it is called his personality.  An individual unlike an inert setting is an autonomous generator of meaning, it generates its own atmosphere, and it is indeed called the personality.  This personality is the charm, the flavor of the person.  It is almost his way of being, his logic of existence.\n\n As for the second duality to which the concept of beauty can be applied, Jaspers says that it is the duality of substance and form.  The beauty of the bottom, that is to say of the essence of being, touches on flavor and it is the one described just now and in which the first duality of being simple versus being could be inscribed.  complex.  Flavor is therefore, for Jaspers, the key word to describe the background of a being, and this flavor is necessarily subject to beauty.  As for the beauty of the form, simply, it is about aesthetics.  An object can be aesthetic by its appearance, therefore by its form.\"",

        "text": "I know it sounds a little bit like simulation theory, but I actually mean more than that. Attention, it is getting really weird!\n\nI try to make it more clear: There are people who study religious texts like the bible for ciphers. Now just replace the bible and take our language, the letters, nature itself and do the same.\n\nTo make an example:\nYou are enjoying a cold winter day. It is -1° celcius.\nBefore you get to a park, you are being stopped by an old lady who mentions the necklace you wear on this cold winter day. She says how beautiful the rhombus form looks. You are impressed by the compliment even the next weeks. Now you watch nature. Take a cloud or a tree. The very shape sometimes reminds us of something specific. Now common sense says that we only overinterpret some random natural patterns here. But what if these patterns actually are a cipher for something more, even if it looks totally weird? Like, say you see a lion in the clouds. And later on you stumble upon an image of a lion on tv. Say, Lion King. Now you notice that 'i' is the second letter in Lion and in King. You associate that one with i^2 which mathematically stands for 'minus one'.\nNow nothing special here, but this is the second time that you think of minus one. And maybe the next days or weeks you will notice it much more.\n\nThe first time was a direct impression of looking at the thermometer which showed '-1'. Then a lot of associations in your mind brought you to the second '-1'. Now maybe when you notice minus one the next time you think, what a weird coincidence. Maybe there are even more symbols involved which consist of a pattern that your mind became aware of or at least dealt with subconsciously. \n\nLike, the next thing you notice is, if you deform the symbol 1 a little bit and make it longer on one side, you get /\\  together with the minus you receive /-\\ which reminds you of the letter A. Furthermore, you think, well if minus one is representing the letter A, then what is representing plus one? Maybe the mirrored version of A? The closest letter to it may be the letter V. Now the next thing you think of, that together with A on top of V they form a rhombus. \n\nI know the thought process is totally crazy and random, but in the end, the whole impressions and thoughts you invested either consciously or subconsciously, are bringing you to the symbol of a rhombus, which was the one the old lady liked so much at the beginning of the 'thought journey'. \n\nNow, what's the meaning? There doesn't have to be a specific meaning. But: I want to know if there is any philosophy which is representing this kind of mindset which plays with symbols and impressions and letters and associations to connect them to different new symbols which eventually reoccur. \n\nMoreover, if you consciously think this is crazy, what if your subconscious mind does this whole the time? \n\nI'm asking this because I believe through my own experiences, that I had something like a vision, but maybe in the end it was just my subconscious mind which did such complex and weird connections that it already had a result in mind while my conscious mind even was concerned with the question.\nLike: what is 9166373838282 times 537373835, obviously you don't know the answer to it directly. But somehow your subconscious is able to do these huge calculations.",

        "text": "I'm looking for an introductory overview of the Judy Benjamin problem, but most of what I'm finding is more technical than I can handle.\n\nIn my understanding, the Judy Benjamin problem goes like this: Judy is in enemy territory. She is either in Red (R) or Blue (~R) territory, and whichever of these two possibilities is right, she is also either in Second (S) company or Headquarters (~S) company. To begin with, her probability function is neutral between all possibilities, meaning P(R&amp;S) = P(R&amp;~S) = P(~R&amp;S) = P(~R&amp;~S) = 1/4.\n\nJudy then receives information from another officer, who tells her that *if* she is in Red territory, odds are three to one that she's in Headquarters company. The problem is how Judy should update her credences given this information.\n\nI understand that Judy cannot update by standard conditionalization, because her new information is not in the form of a proposition that she can now regard as certain. Nor can she update by Jeffrey conditionalization, because her information is not in the form of a proposition that she can now assign some new unconditional credence. So a variety of more complicated update rules are proposed, some of which have the concerning result that Judy's new unconditional credence in R should be less than 1/2.\n\nI'm struggling to understand some of the mathematics involved in the proposed new rules, but at a more basic level, I don't see why Judy shouldn't update like this:\n\n* P'(R&amp;S) = 1/8\n\n* P'(R&amp;~S) = 3/8\n\n* P'(~R&amp;S) = 1/4\n\n* P'(~R&amp;~S) = 1/4\n\nIsn't this the straightforward, intuitive way to update?
