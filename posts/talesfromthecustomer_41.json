        "text": "Horrible service all around. I'm a server too, and I know that working on NYE sucks. You'd rather be with your friends, and everyone's loud and happy and annoying. But this? This is beyond bad service. This was fucking mind-blowingly shit. We're talking about a chain bar/grill type place. \n\nSo at 11pm a server walked around selling a bunch of \"silly string\" for the countdown. We bought some. We weren't told that it wasn't actually silly string, it was some kind of synthetic snow foam shit that melts and gets everywhere. When 12am rolled around my friends and I were shocked to find ourselves covered in sticky white foam from the other tables spraying it at everyone. Our food and drinks were inedible because didn't hand out covers. No warning either. \n\nStrike one. We called a server over. Our drinks were mostly half gone, and we didn't really care. Ordered a bunch of drinks again and told her to take the ones with the foamy shit away. Then we asked if she could please give us a new basket of nachos or take it off the bill. She was argumentative. \"Uh, you ate half of it.\" She rolled her eyes at us. \n\nTHAT WAS BEFORE IT GOT COVERED IN SHIT. THAT YOU NEVER TOLD US ABOUT. \n\nWe insisted, and she wordlessly took it away. She never came back. We found out later that she didn't take it off the bill. Whatever. \n\nMy friends were quite drunk and happy at that stage, and they were enjoying themselves. A familiar song came on and they started dancing, which isn't an uncommon sight in this neighbourhood bar. I'm trying to forget how shitty the service is here and going along. \n\nStrike two. A couple minutes pass and out of the corner of my eye I see one of their servers take their phone out and while sniggering, point the camera at my dancing friends. What the fuck. \n\nOk, that's fucking rude. But no big deal. I approached the manager and let her know. She looks at me, looks at the offending server, says she'll talk to him, and walks away. I was perplexed. My SO watched her, and she didn't talk to that server. \n\nAn hour passed, the manager was standing around talking to her coworkers. She didn't come back to follow up about what we spoke about. No explanation, no apology, nothing. \n\nWe paid the full bill and left. It was my first time there and it will be my last. It was atrocious. Jesus. \n",

        "text": "I had gotten a videogame made by THATGAMEDEV for my computer.  It installed fine and even seemingly ran fine. About 20 minutes into playing, the game crashes. I try it again. It does the same thing. I try a restart before trying it again. The crash still happens. I try a couple basic fixes that work for other games. The issue is still happening. I look up the issue. On THATGAMEDEVs forums I find a list of fixes. They are all things I previously tried. There are no posts in games forums about people reporting the issue, but are plenty in nonTHATGAMEDEV forums. I find it a little odd, but and up deciding to contact their support.\n\n\nAt the time, I lacked a call phone and the landline was being used by my mom. I wanted to deal with it, so I could play. I selected the live chat option of  THATGAMEDEVs support. I fill out a text box with my issue details, including what fixes I have tried before. I wait a full half hour before getting connected.\n\n\nThe chat starts out with the guy giving his name. He asks what my issue is. I describe it. He tells me that there are a couple of easy fixes to that. He tells me to restart my computer. I'm using said computer for the chat and am leery of restarting it and getting thrown back into the waiting list. I mention as such and say I tried that along with all the other said offical fixes in THATGAMEDEV forums. He tells me that unless I restart my computer right this second he will mark the issue resolved. I agree to and close down everything. I restart.\n\n\nUpon logging back into my support account that I had to made to communicate with their tech support, I see my ticket marked resolved with a note that I ended the chat, so my issue must of been fixed. I use an option that lets me unmark it resolved and get back in line for the live chat again. I am waiting for over 1 hour. I look at the estimated time remaining to get a representative. It is 35 minutes. I have to go to the restroom. I'm in there for only five minutes max. Upon returning I see a chat log with a different representive. This one asked the issue. Upon getting no response, they said \"Well looks like your issue resolved itself.\" Then they ended the chat. \n\n\nI again unresolve the ticket. This time I try email. The first thing I get is a question about the issue. It is three days later after copy and pasting exactly what I said in the ticket notes, that I get a copy and pasted list of fixes. I response with the fact that I tried all of those and even mentioned that in my previous email. The response takes a full week to get back. The representative states that my issue must be fixed because there are no known issues beyond that. He insinuates that I am lying. He says that He will revoke my support account, if I continue wasting their time.Then he resolves the ticket.\n\n\nThree months later in patch notes for that game, I see a fix is included for a crash that happened at roughly twenty minutes each time The game was started up. Guess it became a known issue.\n\n\nI have another story about another game and trying to get that fixed, but I didn't feel like typing it up right now.\n\n",

On our way back from the pizza place we stopped at a gas station that was close to our house to get a couple of 2 liters. This was about 11 pm, and we noticed one of our friends was there and we had a short conversation with them. \n\nWe got in line behind our friends, and they told the cashier that their items were going to be on separate transactions (as in, they were just paying separately). For some reason, this really made the cashier angry. He started arguing with my friend's mom, saying they *had* to put all of it on one transaction. I should mention at this point that this employee had signs hanging above the register that he had written in crayon. So my friend's mom says something like \"I also don't think you should have handwritten signs like that\" and he flipped out. He threw their 2 liter soda into the cigarette rack and was screaming at everyone in the store to leave.\n\nMy mom, my friends and I all walked out and called the police, but they said they couldn't do anything if he didn't hurt anybody. So my mom and I went to another store and asked them to call the regional manager, and we never saw him again after that. \n\nAs we were standing outside waiting for the police, my friend told someone as they were going inside, \"Don't criticize his signs!\" I will never forget.

        "text": "The week before Thanksgiving, we drove 7 hours to Tampa and were starving at 4:30pm upon arrival, so we found an open restaurant near our hotel. They were serving an \"in-between menu\" in their dining section when we arrived at 4:40pm, which the hostess explained to us. No problem, we said. We plan to eat dinner at 5 when you start serving it, but in the meantime we are happy to order an appetizer and some drinks off your in between menu.\n\nThis is where it gets weird. She said no - we either had to wait 20 minutes to be seated for dinner OR we could sit now, order off the in-between menu, close out, come back to the hostess stand, and be reseated for dinner. This is all in the same section and it was a waterfront restaurant - they weren't resetting the tables for dinner service and they weren't very busy.\n\nI worked as a hostess a few years ago, so I know it's not her fault that they have a weird policy. I politely ask to speak to a manager. He happens to be standing right next to her. I again calmly explain that we are happy to order off the in-between menu now, and we're not asking for the dinner service now, but we would prefer NOT to have to change tables in 20 minutes if possible as we plan to order a full dinner after 5pm and we've driven a long way to get here. He makes a big deal about it, then finally sighs and says \"fine, just seat them.\"\n\nI made it a point to be extra nice to our waitress and we spent over $400, including two bottles of champagne. I never did find out why their policy existed. ",

        "text": "I was at a certain fast food joint which claims one can \"have it your way\" about a week ago and just remembered this subreddit existed today, and I figured it would be a story worth sharing. \n\nWe got to the register where a man I will call M was working, and we had a fairly big order. I forget fully, but it was something like an Original Chicken Sandwich, two dollar spicy chickens, and two dollar hamburgers, as well as a small onion ring. This isn't exactly it, but it was a week ago so, sorry. \n\nM was probably not the guy that should have been on the register. He was clearly dealing with some form of mental challenge and was having a hard time entering things into the computer system. But, he was a nice guy and we were working with him to get everything ordered. Cue his coworker, P. M was asking P for a lot of help, and while P did help him, he kept saying things to M in front of us like, \"the button is right here, moron,\" and similarly rude comments. We got the food, and our mistake was that we did not check it until we left. Much of the order came out incorrectly. \n\nWe went back to the restaurant after discovering that very little was correct, and it turned out that M had left. Either he was upset by P's treatment, or his shift ended. I'm not sure which. So, we took the incorrect order to P, who started saying rude things to his manager about it while my friend was going over our receipt for about the third or fourth time. P kept saying things to his manager along the lines of \"who the fuck hired the fucking retard? He can't even get one order right. Who put the retard at the register?\" and making hand gestures paired with \"durrrrr\" sounds, trying to be funny to his coworkers. We brought the manager the receipt, ignoring P for the time being, while he was full on flirting with her as she was trying to fix our order. The manager said nothing to stop this asshat. \n\nWe got our correct order and I asked why my friend kept staring at the receipt while we were in the store. He pointed out that everything M put into the computer in the first order was correct. It was everything that P put in that ended up being wrong on the first transaction. It became kinda apparent to us that P had been sabotaging M's order. We decided to put in a call at this point and were put in contact with the DM of the store. \n\nThe DM said they would send somebody over to look into the store and look at the tapes, before we mentioned the names of the employees. After we did, we found out the best/worst part of all this. P and M are brothers. How could this establishment allow for a brother to talk to his brother this way in front of customers? P is still working there. How do I go about taking this to a higher authority?\n\nEdit: Thank you to those who gave constructive suggestions. If P is still working there the next time I go in, I'll end up making a public Facebook post for the company about his and the manager's behavior. One detail I forgot to add was the fact that the manager mostly laughed all of this off, including P flirting with her toward the end of our stop in there.",

I'd rather not risk getting hit by a car.) So as I'm riding, I see a golden arch up ahead and think \"that's what I want\". So I go over, and as I pull up, a worker is coming out, and locks the door behind her, this is what takes place:\n\nMe: Pardon me, are you guys closed?\n\nMW: The dining area is closed, but our drive through is open 24/7.\n\nMe: Oh good! ... Wait... Will they let me go through on my bike?\n\nMW: Unfortunately not, that's against the policy.\n\nMe: Boooo. I just wanted some cheese burgers, oh well, thank you though.\n\n(At this point I'm starting to ride away.)\n\nMW: Hey, what did you want? I can swing through in my car and drop it off over here to you.\n\nMe: really?! You wouldn't mind?\n\nMW: Not at all!\n\nSo I let her know what I want, just a cheeseburger and a hamburger, and gave her the money, and tell her to keep the change. Sure enough, after a couple minutes, she pulls back up, and gives me the bag. I thanked her profusely, then i sat out side, opened both burgers, took one bun off the hamburger, and slapped that hamburger inside the cheeseburger, and made myself a poor mans big mac. And it was delicious. \n\nSo to you random golden arch employee, thank you, for satisfying my hunger with your selfless deed. :)\n\nEdit: removed company name.",

So I go looking for it.\n\nI get there, make my way to tools (I don't normally shop at Orange Home Improvement Warehouse, but it's gotta be there, right?), and only see the Wave and the Wingman. No big deal, find an employee. They're everywhere. Look, there's a guy next to a computer.\n\nHe searches inventory (which is basically him going on Orange Home Improvement Warehouse's website, selecting the store we're currently at, and seeing what their system says. I could've done that. And I did. Before I walked in!) Voila, they have 12 in stock! Great. Where? He asks another passing employee. Employee goes \"Well did you look in tools?\" Yes, I looked in tools. \n\nI was carrying a Wingman, because if I couldn't get the Skeletool, I'd get that instead. Bit too much, but eh. I hold it up, go \"Yeah, but there's only this and the Wave.\" He asks me to show him where I found it. We walk back over to tools, I show him where I found it. But oh look, there's an empty spot on the wall! Surely that's where it was and someone just miscounted 12 multitools! Never mind the fact the empty hook was in between two Gerber multitools and it was on sale for $19 (down from it's normal $29, whereas the Skeletool was on sale for $29, down from $69).\n\nSo I decide I'm gonna just walk around, try and find it on my own. I pass back by the guy, and he tells me someone told him they were up front, maybe I should check up front. Great. There's a lot of front. So I walk up and down the front of the store, looking in every nook and cranny. No Skeletool. Check all the aisle displays. Nope. So, I give up. If I can't find it, and no one will help me find it, I'll make someone find it for me.\n\nSo I go to Orange Home Improvement Warehouse's website. I'll admit, I should've done this before I came, but I didn't expect it to be such a hassle. At this point I've been in the store for about 30 minutes. So I'm on their website. Orange Home Improvement Warehouse offers same-day in-store pickup if it's in stock. Oh hey. The Skeletool is in stock. Add to cart, buy, sign up for an account to track the order, go to customer service and wait.\n\nTen minutes later, another employee walks up to customer service desk, passes them the Skeletool. Walk up to the desk, and boom, I have my multitool. Aside from minor feelings of guilt at making someone find it for me, I'm happy.\n\nIt's a really nice multitool.\n\nTL;DR: Possibly lazy employees can't find item, buy it online, pick it up ten minutes later.\n\nEDIT: Their may be they're in some places, but here, their is their.",

I am upset by how I was treated because of my confusion about how the discount/sale worked and the cashier's lack of regard toward me when she failed to explain it in terms I understand.\n**********\n\nSo, my mother asked me to run down to the drug store and pick up her prescription and a box of candy. She gave me some money to get everything with and told me I could get something for myself as well. I always feel really guilty about spending money that isn't mine so I hadn't planned to get anything, but I did go look at the lipsticks(I needed a new one because the last lipstick I bought look like it was bright orange when I put it on)\n\nI noticed this yellow tag on about half the store.  Buy one get one 50% off. The candy my mom wanted had that tag and this cheap $2 lipstick had it. I read the tag to see if they could be used together, because I can convince myself to get the lipstick if it's only a dollar. The tag didn't say it only applied to same products. It said \n\n'Buy one get one 50% off\n*on product of equal or lesser value'\n\nSo I take my cheap little lipstick and candy over to get the prescription. Naturally it doesn't ring up right. I let the cashier know and she said she would go check. This is the exchange that followed.\n\nCashier: They both have those tags but it isn't the same product. \n\nMe: but the tag doesn't say it applies to same products. It says of equal or lesser value. The candy costs more, so the lipstick should be half off.\n\nCashier (defensively): but they aren't the same product\n\nMe: that shouldn't matter because the lipstick is priced less than the candy.\n\nCashier (defensively and annunciating each syllable): they are not the same product. \n\nMe ( huffy and irritated because I hate being spoken to like I'm stupid): Okay hold on I think that you feel like I'm attacking you or that we're in some kind of argument right now and we're really not. It's a dollar. I'm not so irrational as to throw a fit for a dollar. \n\nThe tag is misleading you need to be aware that it can cause confusion. If they don't apply they don't apply that's fine, but you need to let who's ever in charge of that discount know because I guarantee you there are going to be people who will throw a fit and actually get into a fight with you over it. its just a dollar I'm not fighting with you over and dollar.\n\n(I finish up paying)\n\nCashier (slightly condescending): actually you're the only person to try and use it that way.\n\nMe ( derisive, condescending, and a little flabbergasted): HA Really! \n\nSo I paid the full $2 for my cheap lipstick that promptly broke two days later and (after the heat of the moment  wore off) felt bad about getting snippy with the drug store cashier. \n\nI don't know, was I right to get a little mouthy with her? It was just a dollar, but I was more upset by how she spoke to me and how dismissive she was being. Like I couldn't read and was to stupid to understand when it was explained to me. \n\nTL; DR\n\nI got mouthy with the cashier at a drugstore over a dollar.",

        "text": "Context: This happened a few years ago when I went shopping with my mother and boyfriend-now-husband. We live in a (sort of but not really) rural area in a conservative state, and this was when a lot of Somali immigrants were moving here for jobs because we had a ton of them to offer. Most of this is going to be paraphrased because it's been a while.\n\nAnyway.\n\nWe're walking down the area with kitchen utensils and stuff when we see at the end of the aisle is a guy I used to work with at a sandwich-based chain (he quit because it didn't pay enough to support his family). He was Somali and really polite, but unfortunately he became an immediate target for Racist Lady.\n\nAs we're approaching the end of the aisle, this woman who'd been casually browsing scooted her cart up to him and pulled an item out of it, putting it in front of his face.\n\n\"Excuse me.\" She said, literally shoving it into his line of vision and personal space.\n\n\"Yes?\" He was unphased by her immediate rudeness.\n\nThe item in question was one of those little restaurant-style red ketchup squeeze bottles. \"I need this in a bigger size.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, we don't have that.\"\n\nHe spoke with a bit of an accent and was usually really quiet, so I'm not sure if she was just being a bitch here or honestly didn't hear him and just had the shortest patience in the known universe. \"*What?*\"\n\n\"We don't have that.\" He shook his head.\n\n\"Are you fucking kidding me? How can you not have this? It's not even that hard to have in stock, you have one size, why can't you have the other?\" I guess she decided that going full tirade-mode would make them magically appear on the shelf. \"Do you even know what I'm asking you for?\"\n\n*Oh, no, no no no.*\n\nMy family and I all exchange looks; we've all worked retail and we know exactly what we're going to do. We keep walking down the aisle.\n\n\"I can't believe people like you just come here to steal all of the jobs from hard-working Americans--\" said like she'd read it a thousand times in Fox News articles or straight from the mouth of Rush Limbaugh \"--and you can't even do the jobs *properly*. This is just unacceptable!\"\n\nBefore she goes off onto another mini-rant, we three pull up next to her and stroll by as slowly as possible, and whisper as loudly as possible amongst each other the following phrases in random order:\n\n\"Oh my god, can you believe what a *bitch* that lady is being?\"\n\n\"Wow what the fuck is her problem?\"\n\n\"I'm embarrassed people think like that still. That's disgusting.\"\n\n\"Yeah she should be ashamed of herself.\"\n\nOur not-at-all-quiet whispers immediately grab her attention. Racist Lady stops mid-rant and is stunned silent (my heart was racing so fast here, I still remember the adrenaline rush of passive aggressively putting someone in their place. I'm petty), puts the bottle back into her cart, and wheels away. We burst into laughter and continue on with our shopping, but it doesn't stop there. At least two other times (that I saw, anyway), we ran into her again. The first time I looked right over to her and pointed, saying \"Oh my god it's her\" and started laughing (seriously, I got a taste of what it's like to be a grade school bully and I almost understand the power trips they must get), mom and now-husband joining in. The third time we saw her, she immediately turned her shopping cart in the opposite direction to avoid us. It was glorious.\n\nTL;DR racist lady at Hell Mart berates employee for something he can't change, my family and I shame her into silence.\n\nSide note: I know since it reads out as a story and is going to come across as really \"I'm a hero\"-ish, but I honestly just thought I'd share so other people could get justice boners like my own when I think back to it. c:",

I don't usually order drinks with delivery since it's much cheaper to buy 2-liters from the store, so this was the first and only time I ordered one from this place. \n\nBy the time the order got to me, it was pouring rain.\n\nI signed the receipt (prepaid by CC) and the driver starts handing me my food, and suddenly he gets this panicked look on his face. He apologizes profusely and says he forgot to bring the soda, but that he would drive back to the pizza place, get one, and bring it back.\n\nNow, that would be like a 15-20 minute round trip for him. I'm not going to make him do that, getting drenched twice more, over a dollar's worth of fake sugary goodness. I tell him not to worry about it, it's not a big deal. He offers one more time and I tell him it's really not a problem. He thanks me, and leaves. I don't know if I ended up being charged for it, and honestly I don't care. Everyone makes mistakes.\n\nEver since then, every time I place an order, it gets delivered to me with a free Diet(tm) Cola(R). I even tried mentioning it to the guy who takes the orders, to tell him it's kind but not necessary, but he responded with \"I have no idea what you're talking about.\" :)\n\nThey've definitely got my business for life (or at least as long as I live here), even if they eventually stop sending free soda. The fact that they still remember months later - that's some amazing customer server right there. :)",

So, assuming you can math, you would know I'd be getting an even $10 change.\n\nBut not this poor fella.\n\nWent through the Drive-Thru for a golden arches breakfast the other morning.  I wasn't given the total until I got to the paying window, and it came to $8.05. I handed the fella a $20 note and said 'hang on I think I have 5c here', so I would get an even $12 change instead of a bunch of coins.  It took about 5 seconds between me handing him the note and then the coin.  \n\nThe guy looks frazzled, I'm guessing he's already hit the '$20' button on the checkout to calculate change, and instead of handing me any notes, he hands me a bunch of gold coins.  I start making my way up to the food window, assuming he can count, but have doubts and sure enough, he's handed me 8 $1 coins....  \n\nI mention to the lady at the last window that I didn't get all my change, I explain how I handed him a $20 and then 5c as my order was $8.05, and only got $8 change, and she goes to check with him.  He comes out and apologises, but mentions they both have to look at the computer together to figure out what went wrong.  As I suspected, his brain was frazzled and $8 must have just got stuck in his brain and reverberated.\n\nSo they hand me my breakfast and I pull over whilst they go through the computer to figure out what went on...\nI've just about finished eating when the fella comes back out with another handful of coins for me and apologises...  But instead of it being $4 it's $3.95 (as I guessed, he's hit the $20 button on the register before I've mentioned the 5c, which is fair enough.  But still, it's not rocket science).\n\nSeeing as I can probably look under one of my car seats and find 5c I wasn't going to push the case any further, but I definitely had a good giggle to myself that morning as I drove to my destination.\n\nDon't confuse people with extra coins people!!!

        "text": "This happened a couple of years ago, but a friend asking me for some advice today reminded me.\n\nNot long after moving to my current town I bought a bike off a colleague. Not long after that I went off road where I shouldn't have and ended up with multiple punctures in both tires. I decided it would be easier to replace the tubes, rather than fixing the punctures (not that I had a puncture repair kit). I checked what type of tube I needed, wrote the info down and stuck the note in my wallet. \n\nAbout a week later I was driving somewhere to meet a friend when I saw a bike shop. I thought since I had some time up my sleeve that I might as well quickly drop in and grab a couple of tubes. I had been putting it off, and was starting to feel lazy. It turns out my spur of the moment decision was a big mistake.\n\nI walked into the shop, there was one person looking at the bikes, another at the counter, and walking past me was the employee. I said \"Hi, I...\". Without looking at me he said, rather curtly, that he was with someone, and continued on his way. It seemed he was helping the person looking at the bikes. I looked around and saw the bike tubes next to the counter, so I walked over and immediately saw the ones I was looking for. The person already at the counter said it might be a while, as there was only one person working and that he had already been waiting 10 minutes without so much as being acknowledged by the employee. Not long after, he said he had enough and left.\n\nI thought, oh well, sometimes it can't be helped. At the same time I was conscious of the time, and that I had to be somewhere soon. I grabbed three tubes (always good to have a spare right?), and a puncture repair kit, totaled it up in my head, and realised I had the correct change (it was something easy like $40.50). I then waited another couple of minutes during which another person came into the shop. Thinking this would be a quick easy transaction, I walked over to the employee and began \"I have the correct ch...\". He turned on me and snapped \"I am with someone!\". It should be noted they weren't actually speaking at that point, the customer appeared to be reading some kind of literature, at the outburst he looked up with a mixture of shock and embarrassment and mumbled something along the lines of \"Really, it is okay.\". \n\nThe employee was glaring at me, ignoring what the customer had said, I didn't want to be late meeting my friend, and I had had enough saying, \"I guess I will come back another time.\" I walked back to the counter, put the tubes and repair kit down and headed towards the door. The employee sarcastically exclaimed , \"Some customers! Simply can't wait their turn!\". Definitely losing my temper at this point I said, \"Some employees, don't know the meaning of polite! I don't think I will come back ya Dickhead! (Yeah, not real proud of that one, but it felt good). The best part was, someone who had walked into the shop as the exchange was going on, turned around and walked straight back out again.\n\nAnyway, I met up with my friend, told him about the exchange. He told me there were two other bike shops in that area. On my way home I went to one, got my three tubes, a puncture repair kit, and decided to buy a new pump, it was a pleasant experience and have been back many time since. Including the time I spent a lot of money on a new bike. The best bit though, is my job involves a fair bit of employee turn over and a lot of interaction with people who have recently moved to the town. I have a lot of people ask me where the best place to buy bikes and accessories is, since they see me riding mine. I always refer them to the second shop, and tell them to stay well away from the first one. In fact this very thing happened today, which is why I was reminded of this story.",

At the front entrance there was a sign indicating \"please wait to be seated\" so initially we did just that. There was just one family waiting in front of us. The place was clearly pretty dead; at least half of the tables were empty.\n\nWe waited several minutes without any sign of any staff members, and several people just walked past us and right in to the pub. Eventually I said \"the hell with this\" and my friend and I walked in and sat at one of several open tables. We were legitimately confused about whether we were supposed to wait or just walk in given the lack of responsiveness of staff and the behaviour of other customers.\n\nA moment later, a man who appeared to be a manager walked over to our table with the family that had been waiting at the front in front of us, and told us that those people were in front of us and he was giving them that table. This was totally understandable and we moved without complaint and sat at a different open table.\n\nA server came up to us and, to her credit, she was friendly and tried to be helpful. She asked if we'd been helped, we briefly summarized the situation, and she said she'd be happy to settle us in. The manager then walked over, told her not to help us, inexplicably claimed there was a wait list in spite of the fact that the place was very obviously not busy, and ordered us to go wait at the back of the line at the front (behind people who had actually arrived after us, since the only people who were in front of us had been seated) with a passive-aggressive \"if you don't mind\" thrown in. I replied \"actually, I do mind, since we waited several minutes there without service, several people walked straight past us and seated themselves, and clearly half the tables around us are available.\" I explicitly told him we were willing to sit at any table that was convenient, that multiple people had just walked in and singling us out was totally arbitrary, and that the server had already offered to help us and resolve the situation immediately so I failed to see the problem.\n\nHis response, in a wannabe tough guy tone, was that there were plenty of other pubs in the area and that I was welcome to go to them instead. I said that we certainly would, and we left.\n\nKudos to the server; I feel bad that she has to work for an idiot that clearly revels in creating and escalating conflict with would be customers. I like to think of myself as a pretty reasonable customer but it was like the guy was going out of his way to be as annoying as possible and make it as difficult as possible for us to get service. This was the most \"Larry David\" situation I've been in in a while.\n\nFortunately his suggestion that we go somewhere with better service than he provided was sensible at least!",

It's the last thing they put up before they got fired. (Please excuse Typos, Formatting (New to formatting) and wrong translation, english is not my mother tongue)\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nIt's the early February of 2015 and I recently rediscovered the Joy of playing Pokémon thanks to the remake of the 3rd Generation (my favourite one). While already having the required console, I decided to visit a small store belonging to a chain I might call \"Playstart\". As someone who actually looks out for deals and well situated prices I spot the game of my need for 20€ off the original price (as sold in the store next door). Seeing as I can buy the other complimentary Utility from the Nintendo store, I decide to take an e-store card as well, and go to the cash register. The usual two Bro-Type of guys are at it and completely ignoring the customers, lets call them Tally and Chubby. talking about their *3000*€ TV set ups for playing FIFA, as well having a herd of small kids and the family behind the counter and the back room. Keep in mind, its a small store, so approx. 40m².\n\n\nI cough a little to get attention, get the usual disgusted look (wasn't the first time they were disrespectful, more maybe later if you wish to), and they start to ring me up - around *44,99*€. As it just was payday, I handed him a *200*€-note, bank didn't give me smaller ones. He bags my purchases, hands me the bag and turns around with a smirk.\n\n\n*Uh... Excuse me? There is something missing!*\n\n\nAfter me asking him about my change, he looked me dead in the eye... and told me he's keeping it as a tip. I was gobsmacked. Utterly upset. I was lost for words. What the fornication related swear word just has happened? Luckily after their first incidents I always took backup with me, and my buddy took over and told them he's now going to call the police. Tally went into the back room (he is usually more nice when he's alone, and got his job back recently), and Chubby sneered at me \"*Its just a joke, calm down. Wondering if your fatty friend throws a tantrum, like the loser he is, playing pokemon!*\". He handed me my change and receipt and from then on ignored me and started treating other customers.\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nFast forward a few hours, as I arrived home and contacted corporate. My pal backed me up as witness. They asked me to mail the receipt directly while we were on the phone, apologized for it and investigated. I thought that was it, but no. Again, I got more than I expected. On the bad side. Next morning I awoke to a facebook message from an unknown person. at least at the first glance. I deem you already figured it out, but Chubby found out who I was (not that hard, as I'm a local comedian, author and game dev), and left me a long message about that I'm a (citing) humourless fag, should grow up and I almost got him fired, I shall not bother to enter the store ever again or else.\n\n\nNeedless to say, I relayed that message back to corporate and never entered their store until he lost his job.\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nThis just one of many stuff that happened in this store, amongst trying to drive a female friend of mine to kill herself, stealing merch from customers, cancelling preorders for fun and lols, insulting customers with derogatory terms, refusing service people \"because they are gay\" and a lot of other stuff. \n\n\nThere are a ton of very nice store clerks and cashiers around this city, and they earn my respect by doing their job well and way over the top, but its the bad apples that damage their reputation sadly.",

The shop I stop at it pretty awesome.\n\nOnce the barista remade my drink twice because I have to drink decaf (I'm breast feeding). I tasted coffee in it twice and felt like an ass for asking her to remake it a second time. She just laughed and said she breastfed her kid too and knew how careful someone had to be. \n\nThe second time was after a late night at work. The shop had a huge crowd of people, I think it was a bus from a church. There were three women in the crowd who were incredibly nitpicking and kept going back and forth and giving the baristas hell for 20 min. I was waiting in line and just told the girl to finish up their order before taking mine. I only had to wait a few minutes but the barista looked so much more calm when she came back over. \n\nAfter both of these situations, I thought I'd write to Their corporate headquarters to give them a customer compliment. I wrote a long email and sent it off thinking they made get some good feedback from their district or regional manager.\n\nThe way their feedback letters are set up you have to include your address. Two weeks later I got a giftcard in the mail with a very nice letter from their customer service department. They said they hoped I'd continue to visit their location and that they loved that I received such wonderful customer service. \n\nThen yesterday I stopped in on my way home from work. The one barista recognized me and asked if I was the one who put in the customer compliment. After I said yes, she smiled and gave me my drink on the house. \n\nI never expected getting anything from acknowledging their excellent customer service, but both the giftcard and the drink from the barista really made my day.\n",

        "text": "I was working on building a large concrete block wall outside my home to replace rotten wooden ties.  It didn't turn out perfectly but I saved about $3000 in labor so I'm happy with it. Overall the project went well, except for one part.\n\nThe way the wall went together you put each block up like bricks on the outside of a house where you overlap one onto two bricks below it.  For the wall one end was going to be  straight up and down, the other a slope to follow my yard slope.  I needed some blocks cut to size to make the end straight, which you think would be easy to get done.\n\nI could find no one that knew anyone that cut concrete blocks and was available.  I decided to rent a tool and do it myself.  I'm usually handy and like to do projects that don't involve me risking the house burning down or flooding.\n\nI did my homework, I both called and reviewed the website of the big box store I found had the only usable tools with a deep enough blade.  $35 for half a day and a $75 deposit.  I thought it was a damage/theft deposit and I would get that back, that was fine and the saw price was fine.  My call was to make sure they had the item in stock and they told me this and hung up on me.\n\nSo I drove and went in to rent the tool.  I had to rent a blade too.  You pay after its returned but pay the deposit up front. So I missed the part where not all accessories were included in tiny text, and didn't give the price of these accessories regardless.\n\nI had rented the world's most dangerous tool. It jumped, let off dust farther than you can imagine and made noise you could hear the entire length of the street.  I cut my blocks and returned it.  My wall was finished.  That said it was slightly damaged, the blade guide wasn't flat making my work harder  and when I realized this I decided the jumping was a problem too.\n\nI pointed out to the worker at th return the item was damaged and the two guys showed no ability to care about that.  Wait, I owed more money?  Huh?\n\nI paid, reviewed my receipt and nothing added up.  How did I pay $98?  It wa supposed to be $35.  The receipt itemized nothing.\n\nCustomer service couldn't help me and the tool rental people wouldn't.\n\nSo I went back, got them to give me the contract, yes, afterwards.  There was damage insurance and the blade cost more than the saw.  Ok, the blade isn't horrible to pay for if a bit high.  I then realized I paid for insurance for a damaged tool and no one told me until after I paid, nor did they offer to take it off.  Hell no.\n\nSo I filled out their online survey stating I was very unhappy. That was All Saturday.  I received a call on Sunday from a manager that gave me a $75 credit in the store.\n\nA tile project was next and that funded most of what we needed to do it.  You don't have to offer me money twice, the credit was used within an hour.\n\nAnd that's how poor customer service led to a crazy increase in the price from things they didn't tell about and I ended up paying around $35 for my rental.",

I accepted this, but asked him to have a look at the port.\n\nHe took the phone out back, took it apart, and used a jet of air to clean the port.\n\nIt still wouldn't charge\n\nI was informed I would need to pay £150 for a replacement.\n\nI couldn't afford the replacement at that point in time, so took the phone back home.\n\nI became frustrated, and inserted a toothpick into the charging port.\n\nI unclogged a huge chunk of dust from there, and lo and behold, the phone now charges.\n\n\nI can't describe how immensely disappointed I am with this customer service, do you guys feel this is something worth complaining about?\n\nTL:DR, Phone stopped charging, tech guy took phone apart and found no fault, at home I used a toothpick to solve the age old problem of dust.",

I know that the this store price matches so I decide to do a lap around the gaming area while I look to see if any certified retailer had it cheaper. That's when I saw it. \n\nSome one had stacked a couple of headsets with the wrong price tag. Headsets were of high value, which I will call A4, and since I first heard of them 4 years ago I've dreamt of owning a pair and at this price I can't afford to pass on the offer. As the titles says this is a tale from the other side, I was an ex employee of the company, I know the rules I know exactly what to do. I stand look around to find the headset that was supposed to be there and don't see any in sight, I send my brother to do some recon and he finds them about 2 aisles over. Good so they do have the right ones in the right spot. Then I look to see if there are anymore of these A4 headsets. None are in sight these are the only ones in this sections and are clearly mispriced.\n\nAfter all the information ad been gathered I stood and waited for an employee to approach me. took 30 min but I knew if I could get them for the misprice It would be worth it. Finally some one came over. \nFT (me) BE (employee) \n\nBE: need help with anything? \nFT: Yeah, is this the actual price, because online its something else. \nBE: No...looks like this is in the wrong spot...that's definitely not the price.\nFT: yeah..\nBE: Yeah...let me look up the price for you.\nFT: Actually, the last time something like this happened I the item had to have been sold to me at this price. (True story, took 100 off a nice mouse) \nBE: Yeah...well it varies from store to store.\nFT: Not really I know that its store policy that's why you guys have the key code on your register.\nBE: Oh, well that not up to me to decide its up to my manager or lead, did you want to talk to one?\nFT: Yeah lets do that. \n\nHe then proceeds to leave and find a manager one. strolls by me and he asks if he has time to help me. Manager says not really, what is it that I am asking. All the employee can say is, \"well he found something and its not in the right...\" Manager interrupts and says we have to match it and walks away. Employee comes back and I get what is an expensive headset for a very economic price. My only with this whole experience is I didn't even buy the charger so now I have to go back.",

Can you tell me where they were access from?\n\nMy fear was that some hackers in Russia or something had cracked my password and were looking at boobies on my dime.\n\nCS: It looks like they were accessed from [City] and [IP].\n\nVK: Hmm, that's my city and my IP.

        "text": "I was out at a work happy hour last night, at a moderately sized chain restaurant.  As usual, corporate places = relatively sad liquor and beer selection, but I found a bottle on the menu that was something I've purchased to drink at home, with a rather unique name.  Let's call it Tennessee Whiskey Cask Ale.  It's on the menu at $7, which is a ridiculous markup for this beer, but it's a bar in downtown Chicago, so what are you going to do?\n\nI order it by literally pointing at the drink menu.  There are only about 12 bottles on the list, but I tell the server I want the Tennessee Whiskey beer.  No problem.\n\nI do two rounds of beer, and it's time to head home.  \n\nAsk for the bill.  $18+tax = $19.XX\n\nFor two beers listed as $7 on the menu.  I call over the server and do my politest \"Um WTF\"\n\nShe checks and comes back and says I was drinking the Tennessee Whiskey Cask STOUT instead of the Tennessee Whiskey Cask ALE.   Mind you, there's no stout listed anywhere on the drink menu.  I didn't request the stout - just asked for the only Tennessee Whiskey beer listed.\n\nServer says she'll have it fixed.  NBD.  Manager shows up at my table, and lectures me in front of my work colleagues (who saw me order this beer) that I'd really been drinking the stout, not the ale, and so therefore I should know that there was a price difference (again, no stout on the menu) but that he'd take care of it just this once.\n\nYeah, it'll be just this once, cause I'm not coming back, douche.\n\nServer drops the bill, looks me in the eye, and says \"if you want to talk to the manager further, he's over there\" and leaves.  Clearly, she's already in trouble for this, which sucks and wasn't my intention.  \n\nOpen the bill, and for the two beers, instead of taking off $2 each to make them the price on the menu, he took $1.14 off.  Total.  I don't even know where that number came from.\n\nSo I'm ticked at this point, and hunt him down.  He seems surprised that I haven't just paid it and left, but fuck this douchebag and his shady shit.  Finally get him to fix it so I'm just paying the normal obscene overcharge for two bottles of beer instead of the wildly inflated obscene overcharge.  \n\nLeft the extra $4 for the server, who I got the feeling was getting reamed (and may have had to eat the difference since her manager was clearly an awful idiot) but I won't be back, and at the same time they managed to alienate an entire table of white collar professionals from the building next door who also won't be coming back.  Good job, manager.  Losing dozens of customers for easy happy hour business over your obscene liquor profit margins!",

It was pretty fun, all things considered.\n\nOn the second day, we went on a tour of various places in Paris. We went by the Louvre, but we didn't actually go in (it was a pretty cheap trip). I had been a bit of a fool and not packed a warm hat, and since it was November, I couldn't feel my ears. As luck would have it, though, there was a street seller setting up nearby, and he had hats!\n\nI went over to look at this guy's hats. He had them laid on on a blanket on the ground. They were pretty thick, decent quality, and I spotted one I liked. I should mention that thanks to my dad, my accent is pretty Cockney and *noticeable*. It was obvious I was a foreigner.\n\n**Me:** Monsieur, how much for this hat?\n\n**Seller:** 30 Euros.\n\n**Me:** Uh... no, thank you.\n\nI start to leave because hell if I can spend 30 Euros on a hat, and it's pretty clear that this guy is trying to get money out of the foreign kid.\n\n**Seller:** Wait, mademoiselle! How much do you want to pay?\n\n**Me:** Uh... fifteen?\n\nI expected to have to haggle upwards, but he accepted fifteen and gave me the hat *very* quickly. Just as I was leaving, a police officer came up to the man.\n\n**Officer:** I told you this already, if I see you here again I'm arresting you on the spot!\n\nSo yeah, the guy wasn't meant to be there and I bought a hat that he wasn't allowed to sell (I assume that he needed some sort of a license to sell his wares on the street that he didn't have). Oh well, it's a nice hat, and it really was very warm. I still have it!",

He's not violent or anything, but he's obnoxious and determined to make my decisions for me.\n\nNow, this doesn't really bother me.

Our total came out to just shy of $15, so when I got to the window to pay, I handed over the gift card and a fiver.\n\nA moment later she asks if I wanted the gift card back, I told her no. A minute later we get our drinks and food. I'll be MSB, she'll be TG for Taco Girl.\n\n&gt;MSB- Uh, I didn't get my change, miss.\n\n&gt;TG rolls her eyes and looks at me like I'm an idiot- I asked if you wanted the card back.\n\n&gt;MSB- What?\n\n&gt;TG- There's like $.56 left on it.\n\n&gt;MSB, quite annoyed- Then I'll have it back.\n\nTG rolls her eyes, *pulls it out of her pocket* and hands it back to me.\n\n&gt;MSB- I'll have a word with your manager as well.\n\n&gt;TG, folds arms- She's busy.\n\n&gt;MSB, looking at the cars behind me in the drive thru and put my car in park- I got nowhere better to be.\n\nTG, rolls eyes again and walks away\n\nA few seconds later a frazzled manager comes over, we'll call her FM for frazzled manager.\n\n&gt;FM- Is there a problem ma'am?\n\n&gt;MSB- I was just wondering how you do gift cards, is it gift card then other payment, or the other way around?\n\n&gt;FM looks quizzical- Gift card first, like everywhere.\n\n&gt;MSB- I thought so. Also, if someone doesn't want a gift card that still has money on it, can the staff member then pocket that gift card?\n\n&gt;FM- Uh, no, we don't even throw away empty ones for people anymore due to issues we've had.\n\n&gt;MSB- Oh, okay. And are your employees allowed to take an attitude with customers and roll their eyes?\n\n&gt;FM- No, of course not!\n\n&gt;MSB- Oh, in that case you should probably tell TG everything you just told me.\n\nI went back a few days later to use what was left of the gift card (in terms of service, they're the worst, but I am addicted to their tacos.) FM was there again, and apologized about the situation the previous week. FM told me the girl was no longer working there, and hinted that the gift card issue was just the tip of the ice berg. \n\nTo apologize for the incident, she threw in a free dessert. Win-win situation.\n\nedit: formatting",

        "text": "I've been a long-time lurker to this sub, and now I finally have a story to share.\n\nToday, I went to certain retail pharmacy chain to pick up a few monthly essentials.  I hadn't shopped at this specific location before, but have used other locations in the past.  When I came in, I didn't get a greeting (but personally no big deal). So, after picking up my items, I head to the front cashier.  After standing in line for about 5-6 minutes, it is just one guy and myself in line.  At this point, the cashier starts demanding that we take our purchases to the cosmetics counter.  A little weird, but I figure maybe her shift is ending.\n\nHowever, to my surprise, she's still manning the counter so I approach her counter.\n\nSalesperson (S): If you have cosmetics, go to the cosmetic counter.\nMe: I don't have any cosmetics; can I check out here?\nS (getting suddenly angry and picking out a box of menstrual pads): THESE ARE COSMETICS!\nMe: Those are pads.  (At which point, the other guy who has no idea where to go now starts laughing).\nS: No, they are cosmetics.  Anything near the beauty section is cosmetics (news to me).\nMe: May I go ahead a purchase here?\nS (acting very frustrated): Fine, but I'm trying to make regional sales person for the beauty section and need the sales.\n\nI paid, left, and then called the 1-800-Tell Us Your Experience number to report her actions.  \n\nThe thing is, I would not mind helping someone under normal circumstances.  However, telling people you won't serve them because you won't get to be the local salesperson winner and then making a scene with menstrual supplies is a bit much.  I have never heard of pads as cosmetics until today.  \n\nFinally, a tip to all salespeople: if a woman comes in to buy menstrual supplies and chocolate, just run their order through all ready.  They aren't buying these things to use as stocking stuffers!",

        "text": "Sorry for the long post. I am not a retail worker, but I try not to be a douchebag either, and we are trying to teach our kids that you should always be honest, even if you know you will never get found out. \n\nTo set the stage, my son and I were out, just goofing around, doing some window shopping and wasting a perfectly good Saturday before TGiving. My wife called, and asked if I would mind picking up some groceries on our way home. She also said \"hey, canned veggies are on super sale, so stock up\"\n\nSo we rock up to the grocery store, feeling good, and proceed to get our grocery on. We get to the canned veggie aisle, and I notice they are 4/$1. Hell yeah!! So we grab 20 cans each of corn, green beans, etc. We end with about 100 cans of veggies all told. \n\nSo one thing leads to another, and we are at the cashier station. She starts to ring us up, and after about the 10th can, I notice they aren't ringing up at the sale price. I point it out, she sighs heavily (I'm sure expecting a fight) and informs me there is a limit of 8 cans for the sale price, and everything after that is regular price. \n\nMe: \"Oh, I didn't notice a limit on the tag on the shelf\" \n\nHer: \"Yeah, it's definitely on there. I can have someone show you if you'd like.\" \n\nMe: \"Nah, that's okay. I'm sure you've been through this already today. I'm sorry for the hassle, but I don't really need all these cans, so can I just take the 8 at the sale price and put the rest back?\" \n\nHer: \"Uh, sure. No problem\" \n\nSo we check out, I feel like a moron, my kid is audibly making fun of me for not being able to read the tag. \n\nWe get home, and unload. What's this? 12 cans of veggies? WTH? \n\nI'm kind of internally going over my options, then my kid pipes up with \"Hey, we didn't really pay for those. This is kind of stealing, right? \n\nDammit. So we go back to the store the next day. We walk up to the customer service desk, and try to explain what is going on. After five minutes of back and forth, I finally say \"I want to either give these back to you for you to put on your shelf, or I would like for you to ring me up and let me give you money for them. Either way is fine by me.\" Admittedly, I was a little frustrated.\n\nShe finally explains that since the product had left the store, if I give it back then they will just throw it away. So I asked her to ring me up, and she did. Our total cost (because she gave us the sale price again)\n\n$1. One freaking dollar. Uno. \n\nAfter we finally paid, and were getting ready to leave, the lady smiles at us and says she has something to reward our honesty. And then she hands us a coupon for $2 off of our next purchase. \n\nAs we were leaving, my kiddo looks up at me and asks \"So are we still stealing or what?\" So I gave the coupon to a guy that we passed as he was going into the store.\n",

I have worked in tech for 10 years and know my stuff when it comes to things.\n\nI was looking for a mid range Windows laptop around the £400 to £450 mark - nothing fancy, just something to see me over for the next 4 years until I get enough money to get myself a fancy top of the range Apple Macbook Pro all top spec.\n\nI had seen the laptop i wanted, fit for my needs - grabbed the attention of the floor sales associate walking past and asked if I could get this laptop to go please.\n\nHaving worked in retail before, i was nice and know that it's always nice to treat the workers with the respect and dignity they deserve, advising that I was not interested in any extended warranties or insurance etc...that being in IT, I can fix any related issues myself.\n\nShe was fine, took me over to the checkout and advised that $girl_1 will just get some details from me, my payment then I would be good to go.\n\nWhen it comes to paying purchases I normally save up and pay for it cash in hand. I dont have any overdrafts, loans, credit cards etc, I just have a direct debit card - that is all I need. Typically if I want anything, like the iPhone 6s (bye bye £700) or Laptop i save up for it then buy cash in hand, that way the product is mine to keep, from the outset - not under ownership of a third party company until I pay it off under interest.\n\nThis occasion was no different, I went to the check out where my laptop sat, I advised $girl_1 nicely I was a \"no\" for insurance, extended warranty's etc.... and asked her for total, which she advised it was £435.56\n\nI advised I was paying by cash, took out what money I had, and started counting it - at this point I was just concentrating on counting getting £440, not really worrying about seeing if she was there or not. After I counted the money, I looked up:\n\n&gt; Me: There is £440 *look of confusion* - erm who are you?\n\n&gt; $girl_2: Oh, sorry *small giggle* about that $girl_1 just had to help someone else *points to other person helping out another EU*\n\n&gt; Me: Oh right ok - do you know what I am here for buying?\n\n&gt; $girl_2: Yeah, £435.56 for *points to laptop* with no insurance etc...\n\n&gt; Me: Yup, here is £440 cash in hand, for a moment I thought I was going a bit mad there or you where a timelord who regenerated *thinking she would not get this as she seemed only around the 16 to 18 age bracket*\n\n&gt; $girl_2: Nah, I aint a timelord, but my brother thinks he is - dam him watching doctor who all the time, he is lucky i dont chuck out his stuff for watching it all the time!\n\nWe had a slight laugh and the rest of the transaction went well enough! Just thought i would share this light hearted tale with you all with the message of:\n\n**If you are kind to retail workers and give them a bit of fun in their day, then you can brighten their day**\n\nTL:DR - Apparently timelords work in $computer_chain_stores in the UK.

        "text": "Last week I went to buy one thing at [Electronics Store]. I knew I'd only make it there about half an hour before close (coming from work myself), so I made sure to check the website and see if they had stock, and that I knew exactly what I wanted. I didn't want to be the person that turns up 30 mins before close with an hours' worth of questions.\n\nWebsite said they had stock at my local store, so I raced over after work. I'm wandering around the relevant aisles, looking for the headphones. I wasn't having much luck and a salesperson asked me if I needed help.\n\nI let him know what I was looking for, and he *instantly* said, \"We don't have those.\" I mean: no pause, no hesitation, no even thinking about what I wanted. It was a reflex reaction.\n\n\"Oh, okay,\" I said. I just *knew* he was bullshitting and I also knew I'd checked the site (which I know isn't always 100%, but anyway). \"I checked the site, they said you had plenty in stock?\"\n\n\"Oh.\" He says. \"Oh. Well I'll just check.\"\n\nOff we go to the in store PC, he browses to the exact website I used, searches the headphones and sure enough they say 'In Stock'.\n\n\"Well,\" He says, sounding kinda pissed off, \"it says we have them, but we *definitely* don't.\"\n\nMy 'you're-a-liar' radar is still pinging like crazy, but I just say, \"Oh damn OK, well thanks...\"\n\n\"Store#2 has them in (next area over). You should go get them there.\" (I didn't even realize at the time, but he was using the same stock levels on the same website that said his own store had them! But he was still happy to recommend I drive 30 minutes without really confirming their stock for me).\n\n\"Sorry, I won't make it there before close.\"\n\n\"You should order online.\"\n\n\"I could... Do you know how long shipping takes?\"\n\n\"It can take a week.\"\n\nI'm like ack, a week, no thanks it's a bit long. \n\nSo he leaves me to look around and sure enough, within about 15 seconds, I found the exact item I wanted. Same brand, model, price. I think at this point he twigged and magically reappears.\n\n\"Hey, excuse me... Isn't this them right here?\"\n\nHe looks. \"Oh. Yeah. Well it's nearly closing time, so...\" \n\n\"Uh... Well could I buy these?\" I checked my watch, it's about 15 minutes until they close.\n\n\"Uh... Well I'd have to go out the back to get them for you.\"\n\n\"Oh... Would that be okay?\" And because, again, I don't want to be the guy shopping after they close, I add, \"Do you have time?\"\n\n\"Well it would take me about 5 minutes to get them.\"\n\nI check my watch again. \"If you have time, that would be great...\"\n\nHe kind of brightened up at this point, saying, \"You should buy the floor stock! You want the floor stock?\"\n\nNow he's talking about the set sitting out in the open, no package, no book, no box, no nothing. I really don't want the floor stock that everyone's poked at, worn, etc. Maybe that's me being fussy, but eh, full price for floor stock when they have unopened ones... No thanks...\n\nI tell him no thanks, he kind of angrily trudges out to the back to get me a new box.\n\nI wait for a while, finally he comes back and snaps \"They're at the front counter.\"\n\nProbably a pretty tame story, but I was kind of just amazed. Like he got caught lying/misleading me about stock, encouraged me (quite forcibly) to order online or go to another branch, then made me out to be an asshole for wanting a new package. We all have shitty days and if he'd just said when I first found them \"Sorry man, I stuffed up\" I would have been totally OK with it. It was just the ongoing complete and utter lack of regard for my time, or even me as a person. I was just made to feel like a complete nuisance the whole time. \n\nKinda annoyed, because I didn't want them to even get my money at this point, I bought them cos otherwise I would have had to wait a few days. I just don't think I'll go back there again, the last time we went we asked someone if they knew the differences between two sets of speakers that were very similar and he stood there silently reading the boxes before saying \"I don't know\" and walking off.\n\nOh, and I'd paid and was out the door a few minutes before close, to my relief. Still don't want to be that guy...\n\nEdit: I'm half considering complaining. I pretty much never complain, but this guy was just *so* awful the entire time. I don't know though. I think I'd feel pretty bad.",

Well this guy was dispensing some ham for a couple. \n\nFirst look and you could tell the guy was awfully pissed and looking for a scapegoat making disgust faces at the worker whom was quiet and calm, their exchange went like this: \n\nBitchy guy [BG]: I didn't like it\n\nWorker [W]: You didn't? Okay \n\nBg: It's salty and old\n\nW: Okay, would you throw it here?

YOU are being rude\n\nBg: I don't like his attitude I'm *talking* to him--\n\nMe: No you're not he's been doing his job and you've been complaining all along even though he's been working, I hate people like you who attack the working people like us who aren't doing anything wrong\n\n[I can't hear anything the guy is trying to say to me and his wife seems scared of me, good.]\n\nBg: You know what -- [leaves]\n\nWorker: ...

It's not your fault you're just doing your job\n\nLater I found authority of the shop and told them what the client did and about his tantrum and they said they'd look into it. The worked had NO attitude at all he was chill as fuck.\n\nHe kept thanking me and saying \"god bless you\" and \"thanks boss\". \n\nI'm still angry at the asshole though. I'm worried he'll make the poor guy lose his job which is what that store does because it doesn't care about the worker at all.",

I really wanted to stand up for her but being very small, I wouldn't be able to handle a punch from him should he get violent.\n\nThis was only about 5 hours after a prostitute started threatening a guy for glancing her way while waiting for the bus to come. She kept saying \"I have a gun, I'll shoot you on the bus\" and was actually reaching into her bag. Don't know if she had a gun, because I was already on the bus at this point but damn.\n\nWas yesterday a full moon or something, or did all the crazies come out at once? \n\nEdit: didn't realise I had to make the location more anonymous",

        "text": "This happened a few hours ago but it's still depressing the shit out of me. I guess I'm writing in the slim hope that the actual customer service rep that had to deal with me will see this, but also to acknowledge all customer service reps that are handling the deluge of crackhead-acting customers that are undoubtedly dumping their shit on you this holiday season. \n\nI'm the shipping coordinator for a really fun, small, very new candy company. Normally everything is ALL rainbows and daffodils because it's candy and what could possibly happen to get upset about at a candy factory? But since it's Christmas I have 100 times the orders I normally do and the whole company is feeling very anxious going from the top on down. Added to that, I've worked for much larger companies in the past, all NYC-based, and as a result my default way of conducting business is very direct and requiring immediate results/answers/solutions. I don't like to chit-chat, I want clear responses that don't leave me guessing. I'm courteous but not looking to make friends. And I really don't like to tell my boss that something won't be on time; at the very least I want a very accurate ETA, so if I don't get that or I get some kind of run-around I'm on the war path til I get my answers.  \n\nCut to today -- he was the third customer service person from \"Shipping Company F\" I had spoken to about my delivery of thermal labels since Friday (these labels are ordered directly through \"Shipping Company F\"). No one was able to give me a clear answer as to when they'd be delivered, and the order number still had no tracking # attached to it. I started asking this poor guy just question after question regarding my order: WHEN is it getting here WHY isn't it here yet WHERE is my tracking WHY did the last two people tell me I'd have it already DO you want to lose my business right now I swear I'll take these 400 packages to \"Shipping Company U\" if I don't get a straight answer -- he's answering me as calmly as best as he could, but I wasn't getting direct answers so I kept going and going, and then I heard his voice break, and he choked and couldn't speak for like, a good long minute. I knew right then that he was more than likely one of the myriad seasonal workers brought in to handle to the uptick in shipments for the holiday. I knew he was probably being worked to the bone by aggressive attitudes like mine all day, and probably not being paid enough for it. I could hear him on the verge of tears. I quickly told him that I was sorry, I knew none of these issues were his fault, I was just frustrated because I get in trouble at my job if I don't have all the answers all the time (trouble mainly coming from the standards I set for myself). I thanked him and hung up, but this pitiful feeling sat in me like pure misery. \n\nI just sat there about to cry for a while, texted my boss and my boyfriend to tell them how crappy I felt over being so aggressive to someone who is probably exhausted and overwhelmed. BF suggested I call back, so I did and I didn't have the rep's name but someone tried to help me trace him and said they'd get my message of apology and gratitude to them and their supervisor. I really hope that happened. Who knows. I'm just mortified that I unnecessarily added shit to someone's day... that shouldn't be a part of anyone's job. I'm so sorry.\n\n**tl;dr - I was overly-aggressive to a customer service rep and when their emotions reflected their hurt I also felt the pain of what I'd done.**",

        "text": "My address is pretty simple. It's not 1000 N 50th St, Anytown 12345, but that's close enough for this story.\n\nFor some reason, we get a lot of mail that is not actually addressed to us. I think having a round number address has something to do with it. At least once a month we get something for 1000 W 50th, or 1500 N 50th, or 1000 N 55th, or some similar variant. None of these addresses actually exist, as far as I can tell, at least not in my zip code. And for some reason, these things always have my zip code, sometimes even with the exact 4-digit extension. No idea why people think that is their zip code, but they do. And apparently zip code trumps all, so the carrier looks at this address that doesn't exist and thinks \"I'll just assume it's this similar address in this zip code that does exist.\" \n\nSo far this has always been USPS, and we have always just highlighted/circled the address, maybe written a note to the carrier, and put it back in the mailbox. It's been going on for years and while they never seem to learn, they do at least take away the stuff that does not belong to us, never to be seen again.\n\nBut this time it was Major Private Package Carrier (let's call them UPC for short). And it was two very large boxes. Address was 1004 NW 50th, Anytown, 12345. That's a new one. Pretty sure that doesn't exist, but it's also clearly not the same as the address to which the packages were delivered. Not our name on them, clearly not for us.\n\n**Wed:**\n\nPackages arrive. I call UPC. After slogging through an automated system that has no option for this and does not want to let me talk to a real human, I finally manage to confuse it enough to kick me to a person, and I explain the situation. Provide the tracking numbers on both packages. They say no problem, driver will be by to pick them up later, have a nice day.\n\nSeveral hours later, I get a phone call (paraphrased):\n\nUPC: \"Hi this is UPC calling you back about the report you filed.\"\n\nMe: \"Well I didn't really file a report, I just notified you that packages were delivered to my house that are not addressed to us.\"\n\nUPC: \"Okay so the address on the package is your address but the name is not anyone who lives there?\"\n\nMe: \"No, the address on the packages is actually 1004 NW 50th. I'm at 1000 N 50th. I'm not sure 1004 NW 50th exists. But the name isn't anybody here either. It's clearly a mistake.\"\n\nUPC: \"Okay no problem, we will have a driver pick the packages up and return them to the sender. It may be tomorrow before the packages are picked up. Just leave them on the porch. Have a good day.\"\n\n**Thu:**\n\nPackages disappear from my porch. All good, right?\n\n**Sat:**\n\nPackages mysteriously re-appear on my porch. I don't notice until the evening. I am not thrilled, but it's only a minor inconvenience for me. I'm not messing with their phone system right now, probably no people available anyway. I'll call on Monday.\n\n**Yesterday:**\n\nI call and fight with the phone system again. Explain again, this time sounding a bit annoyed. Provide tracking number again. Only have to provide one this time, person is able to locate a ticket showing the two packages are linked and confirms last 4 of second tracking number instead of making me read it out. Tells me he will notify local dispatch and this time at least warns me to expect a confirmation call from them later that day. Better, I guess, though I still don't understand why the information I have already provided is not enough.\n\nLater that day, I get a call from local UPC person (I think it was the same person as last time). Repeat nearly exact same conversation as before, where they don't understand that the address on the package is somehow wrong and does not match the physical address to which the package was delivered. Once again I think it has finally been cleared up. Am told driver will be by to pick them up.\n\nThis time, packages disappear same day. Then I get a follow-up call from local UPC, confirming that packages were picked up and apologizing for the inconvenience. Success!\n\n**Today:**\n\nHusband is outside doing yard work, when who should arrive but our friendly (but rather frustrated) UPC delivery guy, with the same two giant packages! Husband cuts him off and says those are not for us and we don't want them back. UPC guy asks him to sign a package refusal and says that should fix the issue. Husband feels weird refusing packages that aren't actually addressed to this location but does it anyway, and guy leaves with the packages. \n\nNo idea if this saga is over yet or not. \n\n*edited for better formatting*",

        "text": "So yesterday on my way home from work I realize my gas gauge is low and I need to stop for gas, so I pull into the local gas &amp; convenience store made famous by Bill &amp; Ted. I do the usual pop the gas gap, pull out the handle, shove it in the gas tank hole, lift the handle... ok, need to pay. So I press the \"Debit\" button, swipe my card, and it asks me, \"ENTER PIN\". I enter my PIN, press Enter, and see \"CANCELLED\" on the screen. Huh. Maybe the touchpad is sensitive. Once again I press the Debit button, swipe my card, see \"ENTER PIN\" -- 1 2 3 4 Enter, and \"CANCELLED\" pops up again. I grumble a bit, and just swipe the card to have it run as Credit, and it asks for my ZIP code. Fine, 1 2 3 4 5 Enter, and the pump starts.\n\nAt about 8 gallons (out of the 10 I expected) it just stops, and I see \"PUMP STOPPED\" on the screen. I stare at it for a moment before it changes to \"SEE ATTENDANT\". I grumble again, lock the car, and trudge into the store and stand in line behind about eight people buying various combinations of cigarettes, snack foods, and lotto scratchers. Finally after about ten minutes, I'm at the front and engage the cashier.\n\nMe: Hey, I was on pump 7 and it stopped and said to come see you guys.\n\nCashier: Huh, yeah, it says the pump stopped but I don't see any alerts. If you want to keep pumping I can run a credit card here but you have to give me a dollar amount. \n\nMe: Never mind, it was almost full anyway. But you ought to know your pay terminal is messing up and cancelling every time I enter my PIN.\n\nCashier: That's because we don't ask for your PIN, we ask for your ZIP code.\n\nMe: No, I hit the Debit button and swiped, and it very clearly asked me to enter my PIN.\n\nCashier: If you enter your PIN it will cancel the transaction. That's because we don't ask for your PIN, we ask for your ZIP code.\n\nMe: No, it said in big capital letters, \"Enter PIN.\" \n\nCashier: Yeah, but if you enter your PIN then it cancels the transaction.\n\nMe: Riiiiiight. Okay, well you might want to put some sort of notice on there not to run it as Debit because it asks for your PIN if you do that.\n\nCashier: No, we don't ask for your PIN, we ask for your ZIP code, so it cancels the transaction if you enter your PIN.\n\nAt that point the stupid was just getting too overwhelming so I just shook my head and walked off. I guess there's a reason some people make minimum wage.\n",

        "text": "Apologies for any formatting errors, first time poster and all that!\n\nSo I'm a university student and recently decided I was sick of having a single bed. Figured that with a little parental help, I could afford to upgrade to a queen size.\n\nAfter looking online for a while, I found a really nice bed frame (mattress not included, this is important) at Store A on clearance. Yay! Then found Store B with a sale on mattresses, including a great deal on a brand that was highly recommended to me. Conveniently, it's situated right next door to Store A. Double yay! :)\n\nSo, having found what I wanted, I struck a deal with the parents and arranged to go in and check out the bed and mattress in person. Walk into Store A, sales lady asks if she can help, and mum and I politely decline. Found the bed without any trouble, checked its sturdiness and height and width and all that, and said we'd go for it. So we find the sales lady and ask when it'll be in stock. Unfortunately they won't have one available for a couple of months yet, but that's okay. Then she points out that the bed frame doesn't come with a mattress and asks if we've seen their range, and this is where things got awkward. We're very non-confrontational people, and neither of us wanted to refuse outright and say we were getting one elsewhere (especially because we hadn't tried it yet and weren't certain). So we followed her over to the mattress range, and the prices are horrendous. Upwards of $1000, and then some. Both of us knew we were never going to buy one of them, no matter how much she tried to convince us. But of course she gave us the pitch about how great they are and how they come apart somehow so it's easy to move them around, and how the quality is really good, etc. etc., and we just let her talk. I felt kind of bad for her, having worked in retail and knowing how important those big sales are for individual employees to make their targets, but it was way out of our price range and not at all what we wanted. Then she drops the bombshell that when you buy a frame, all the mattresses are half price. Obviously she thought that the deal would change our minds, not realising that there was no way in hell that I'd be spending $800 on a mattress. Anyway, I said that I hadn't decided on a mattress yet, it was a bit too expensive for me because I was a student, and I wanted to just look around and get some ideas before deciding, because I had several weeks before the bed frame would arrive. She doesn't get the hint and keeps repeating how great the deal is and how great the mattress is and how \"you want to get a good quality one because you want it to last\" etc. I felt pretty bad saying no again, just because of how hard she was trying, and eventually I had to put my foot down and say \"at this point, I'm not ready to decide on a mattress. I might come back at a later date but I won't be buying one today.\" She looks a little disgruntled and disappointed but takes us up to the counter and organises all the bed frame ordering and payment and so on. Her service from the moment I said no was definitely less polite and helpful than it had been earlier, and I got the feeling she had taken the loss of sale (of the mattress, I still bought the bed) personally.\n\nNow this was already an excruciating ordeal with this sales lady, and I was already hoping that I wouldn't have to deal with her when we collected the bed frame. But we shook it off and immediately went to Store B to look at the mattress I actually wanted. It took a bit longer to find, but once we located the right one (on sale!) and I lay down on it and wiggled around to check the firmness and whatnot, we knew it was a done deal. At this point, the sales guy walks up, this lovely older guy who was very polite, didn't try to push the sale at all, but could obviously see that we had fallen in love with the mattress. He answered a few questions, was extremely helpful regarding ordering it to arrive at the same time as the frame, and was even politely interested in what I was studying. After Sales Lady, it was a refreshing change - not that she wasn't polite or helpful, just overbearing.\n\nWhat I wasn't aware of is that Store A and Store B must have had a connecting door, so presumably they shared some resources or something. Because as I was sitting on the edge of the mattress and very definitively telling Sales Guy that I would take it, Sales Lady walks straight past and shoots me the dirtiest look! I swear the timing was unbelievable, she literally walked behind Sales Guy as I was looking in their direction and telling him that the mattress was perfect. So, after telling Sales Lady that I wouldn't be buying a mattress today, she witnessed me doing exactly that.\n\nTL:DR - Told overbearing sales lady that I didn't want an expensive mattress from her store, ended up buying a cheaper one from the store next door while she watched.",

I picked up the bird food I needed and proceeded downstairs to look at fish. I go upstairs when I have decided on the fish I wanted to find a fish guy. The first remark I got was \n\n&gt;\"Oh no I didn't know someone was still down there!\" \n\nWeird comment but I ask for a fish guy. The manager tells me theyre closed and have been closed for 15 minutes apparently; and an employee says in a joking tone \"We almost locked you in\" No apology what so ever.\n\nI ask if I could be rang up for the bird feed, and they say yes, and inform me that they closed their credit card machines after scanning the item. I was short 2 dollars, so I could not purchase the bird feed.\n\nSo TL;DR noone checks the downstairs before they close shop, one employee thinks almost locking someone in is funny, and they don't tell me that they arent taking credit card before saying I can be rung up.\n\nI wish I had another petshop nearby, like large chain [Petstore Company] or even just a supermarket that had animal feed so when I just run out of food and food I have scheduled to ship every month doesn't arrive yet, I can buy a bag of emergency my pets need food now food.",

But sometimes, you find someone who is just incompetent.\n\nSo I bought my girlfriend a new computer at an electronics retailer that also offers tech support and warranty support in house. Unfortunately, she starts having hard drive problems a couple months later. Fortunately, I'd bought her a plan that covered hardware problems.\n\nSo we make a reservation with support to bring the laptop in. No line at the desk when we get there, and we tell them the problem, they check the computer in for repairs.\n\nA day or two later, I get an e-mail saying that it's been fixed. So I go in to pick it up after making a reservation. There's two people standing in line in front of me. After the first guy is done, it's after the time that I'd reserved. The guy at the desk asks the next guy if he has a reservation. Guy says no. Desk guy proceeds to help him anyway, without asking me if I have a reservation. I decide not to be annoying, the guy was there before me, and I'd be annoyed too if someone showed up after me and got helped first.\n\nSo I wait another five or so minutes while he helps this guy before I get up to the desk.\n\n&gt;Him- So did you have a reservation?\n\n&gt;Me- Yeah, for 7:30.\n\n(It was 7:40 by then)\n\n&gt;Him- Okay, well you're a little late, but I've got time before my next reservation.\n\n*WHAT?* I was so incredulous I didn't even know what to say to this idiot. I just wanted to get the computer and go, so I just shook it off.\n\n&gt;Me- Uh, ok. I just need to pick up a computer that was having the hard drive replaced.\n\n&gt;Him- Okay, be right back.\n\nHe runs to the back then comes up front.\n\n&gt;Him- Did you get a call?\n\n&gt;Me- No?\n\n&gt;Him- Oh, well your computer isn't actually ready yet.\n\nHe explains that the e-mail is wrong, and that I'll get a call when the computer is done. As I'm standing at the desk getting more and more annoyed a tech comes up from the back with my gf's computer. Apparently it is actually done.\n\nSo the desk guy is going over the repair with me, and I notice something about the box the replacement hard drive came in. It says 500GB, my gf's computer has a 1TB hard drive.\n\nI point this out. He says his computer says otherwise. Fortunately for him, after standing in line for over twenty minutes, I found myself desperately needing to use the bathroom. I left, with plans to come back later.\n\nThat night, I look up on the internet that the computer does indeed come with a 1 TB hard drive. So the next day I go back in, after making a reservation, and get in line. I'm there five minutes before my reservation. There are two people in line in front of me. Oh frickin boy. They finish helping the first guy after a few minutes. Then, they help the next guy, who had a reservation fifteen minutes before mine. So I wait for another 5-10 minutes while they help him.\n\nFinally, it's my turn. When I try to explain to the guy working the desk what was up, he gave me the blankest stare. \n\n&gt;Him- So... you want to upgrade?\n\n&gt;Me, frustrated as all hell- No! I want what I had! I want what I paid for! Fresh from the factory, this computer comes with a 1 TB hard drive! You replaced it with a 500GB hard drive!\n\nEventually, he got it. So they take the computer in for the repair. A few days later, I get an e-mail saying it's been fixed. This time, I wait for the call. After I get the phone call, I make a new reservation to pick up the computer.\n\nI get there ten minutes before my reservation, hoping to head off anyone who might stand between me and getting the computer back. Once again, I'm standing in line. The woman in front of me is a soccer mom who doesn't know a keyboard from a monitor. So I wait, and twenty minutes later the lady finally leaves. I was finally able to collect the computer without any other issues. As I was leaving, as they all do these days, the guy said something about filling out a survey online. I turned to him and said, \"You didn't do anything wrong dude, but you *really* don't want me filling out that survey.\"\n\nI am never spending the extra money on support ever again.",

I go in and everyone is running around buying things for the holidays. I go to the aisle where the machine is to duplicate keys - no one is there. \n*That's fine* I thought, *Just need to find an employee* \nWell, every employee was busy with somebody so I make my way up to the customer service desk. There's a huge line so I start looking around, and I see a guy stocking the shelves. \n*Perfect! I'll just ask him if there's someone available!* (This may have been my first mistake since maybe he wouldn't know who is available or not.) So I go up to him and here's the conversation that happened: (M= me, Employee = E)\n\n* M: Excuse me, do you happen to know if someone could help me duplicate my keys?\n* E: *sighs heavily* There ain't someone there?\n* M: No, everyone near that area is helping someone else\n\nHe grumbles something and slams the products he was holding (some small boxes, looked like light bulbs or something), and then proceeds to storm off down towards the other end of the store.\n\n(Side note: So here's the thing - I never worked retail in my life..and I've read enough tales from other subs to know how horrible people can be. So, I always try to make sure I'm not adding their daily dose of misery. I felt bad that I seemed to put him in a bad mood)\n\nSo he's pretty much power walking at this point and I'm trying to keep up. I have to raise my voice a little for him to hear me and I said:\n\n* M: \"I'm sorry if I was bothering you. I didn't mean to make you upset.\"\nHe stops dead in his tracks and looks at me in surprise. Then he kind of looks around and sighs even bigger this time, running his hands through his hair. \n* E: \"Look lady, it's..not you. Things are crazy here during holidays and the *fucking* management thinks it's a good idea to cut hours on us or never staff enough people. Do you...do you know what it's **LIKE** (he raised his voice at this point) to work like this!? *sighs again*.. The holidays makes me hate my fucking job\" \n\nAt this point he turns back around and takes me to the key machine. He grabs another employee and I get my keys duplicated. He walked off before I could say anything else.\n\nThis isn't a super dramatic story, but it really made me feel bad. I knew he probably needed to vent, but I can't help feeling somewhat responsible. I tried looking for him after I got my keys, but he wasn't around. \n",

This happened about 2 years ago. \n\nI don't drive and the only grocery close to me is a big chain that's a little bit on the pricey side of things, but their produce is of excellent quality, so it's worth it. \n\nAnyways, one really cold winter day, (Canada and I hate the cold) my mom's boyfriend offers to go grocery shopping for my grandmother and myself, so we didn't have to go out in the cold. So we give him a grocery list, the money for it, and he heads out. He does all the shopping, leaves the store and sits down on a bench that's located maybe about 20ft from the store's entrance. And he starts loading up a big suitcase he brought with him so he could carry everything back and save us a couple of bucks on a cab. He got back to our place, unloaded the groceries, and well... Over half of our groceries were missing. \n\nMB = Mom's bf\n\nL = Mom\n\nG = Grandmother\n\nM = Me\n\nCS = customer service at the store\n\n&gt; M: Where are the chips? Where's the cottage roll? \n\n&gt; G = Where are the potatoes? \n\nAnd well the list just kept going, so we look at the receipt, and he definitely bought and paid for all the items, about $100 in groceries, missing. \n\n&gt; L: MB, how do you lose so many groceries???\n\nSo we were hoping that he accidentally had left the groceries at the register (I've done that with many items). So we called the store. \n\n&gt; CS: Thank you for calling (store) how can I help you today?\n\n&gt; G: Uhm, my daughter's boyfriend was just at the store and did our grocery shopping, and we're missing over $100 of the groceries he paid for, we were hoping that he may have left them at one of the registers???\n\n&gt; CS: Just give me one minute I'll check our books. \n\nSo they checked their books.\n\n&gt; CS: Very sorry to say but no one has left behind more than one item today, is there any where outside the store he may have left them?\n\n&gt; G: MB, did you put the bags down any where outside?\n\n&gt; MB: Oh yeah, when I was filling up the suitcase, outside the store on the bench they have there.\n\nSo my grandmother tells them that, they put us on hold and run out and check, super duper nice of them. \n\n&gt; CS: Sorry, they're not out there either, someone must have taken them. \n\n&gt; G: Well, someone just got a very lovely Christmas present. \n\nShe said it in a joking matter and laughed.\n\n&gt; G: Ah well, thanks very much for checking for us. \n\n&gt; CS: Would it be alright if I put you on hold for a few minutes?\n\n&gt; G: Uhm, sure, what for?\n\n&gt; CS: I'm just going to speak with my manager. \n\nSo she puts us on hold for about 5 minutes. \n\n&gt; CS: Hi, sorry about that, do you still have your receipt?\n\n&gt; G: Yes we do.\n\n&gt; CS: Awesome! If you can, mark on the receipt all the items that you're missing and come back in and we'll give you the items. \n\nMy grandmother was completely shocked. \n\n&gt; G: Really? It was our own fault, you don't need to worry about it.\n\n&gt; CS: No it's alright, it's almost Christmas and my manager said it was alright to. Just come in today or tomorrow, although, if you can come now it'll be a bit easier as I already know the situation and know it was approved, but whenever is good for you!\n\n&gt; G: We could do it now, we only live 5 minutes away, thank you very much! \n\nAnd we marked the receipt for only the items that we were missing (some people would take advantage, but that's what ruins great (superb) customer service like this), he went back and got the items hassle free. \n\nSuper, duper, nice of them.

        "text": "There's an independently owned clothing store that I liked to shop at every now and then. They had a pretty good selection of quality clothing at reasonable prices, and it was never really crowded. My kind of place.\nAnyways, one day I went in to do some shopping. Nothing unusual, just looking for a pair of pants and maybe a couple of shirts. The only person working there at the time was the owner, an old man probably around 70. He had his grandson at the store with him, so I guess he was babysitting. The kid was probably about 5 or 6 years old. \nI walk in, say \"hi\" to the old man, and go about my shopping. As I'm looking around, his grandson starts to follow me around. OK, cool, no big deal, the kids probably bored out of his mind. So I just smile at him and continue my shopping. Well, this kid gets really hyper and starts playing army with me, you know, ambushing me from the clothes racks, sneaking up on me and trying to scare me, that sort of thing. I'm OK with it until he started hitting me in the crotch. I politely told him not to do that to me, but he just laughed and did it again. So I told him again not to do that again, but in a more firm tone. Still didn't stop him, if anything he got worse. \nSo now I'm done playing, he's not listening to me, and grandpa doesn't seem to know what his grandson is doing. So I tell him in a polite way, (I used to work in retail, so I know how to treat people), that his grandson is getting a bit out of hand, and he keeps hitting me in the crotch. I didn't say anything bad about him, I just told him what the kid was doing to a complete stranger. \nSo dude looks at his grandson, and says in a loving grand fatherly way, \"This person doesn't like you! He doesn't want you here!\" I'm like wow! That's a bit harsh! So I say \"I didn't say I don't like him, I just want him to stop hitting me in the crotch.\" Old man just gives me the cold shoulder. OK, whatever, I go back to shopping.\nBy the time I get back to where I was looking, dude starts blaring Christian music in the store, and doing some kind of praise and worship thing obviously trying make me uncomfortable so I'll leave, (I was the only customer in there). \nWow, OK, time for me to go. But I'm still getting what I went there for. So I take my stuff to the counter to pay for it. Old man rings me up while making it a point to continue his praise and worship thing so that he wouldn't have to talk to me. \nGot out to my car and thought, damn, I liked that store.",

I could practically smell the food particles clinging to the guy's clothes. But anyways, I stood there and overheard the following exchange (paraphrasing from memory):\n\nGuy: \"I bought (some video game) here and then I accidentally left it on the bus.\"\n\nClerk: \"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, that's a really good game.\" (The tone here wasn't sarcastic or passive-aggressively twisting the knife; the clerk seemed like she was genuinely trying to be sympathetic)\n\n[A few seconds of awkward silence ensued]\n\nGuy: \"So here's the receipt...\"\n\n[Clerk took it, looked at it, wasn't sure what to do with it. There were a few more seconds of silence while she processed what he was getting at.]\n\nClerk: \"Uh...we can't issue you a refund for an item you lost.\"\n\nGuy: \"That's okay, I don't need a refund, I just wanted a replacement copy.\"\n\nClerk: \"...uh...I'm sorry, but this isn't a situation that would be covered by our refund or exchange policy...I would need you to provide me with a defective product for exchange, otherwise anyone could just say they lost something to receive additional copies of it...\"\n\nGuy: \"You mean there's NOTHING you can do?!?!\" (Guy wasn't so much angry as depressed and flabbergasted here.)\n\nClerk: \"No, I'm really sorry this happened and I hope you have a good day.\"\n\n[Guy slumped out of the store, dejectedly.]\n\nOnce he was gone and I went to the clerk to process my transaction, I said \"that guy was a fucking idiot, no personal accountability whatsoever\" and the clerk was a kinder soul than I, saying that she felt bad for the guy and didn't blame him for being upset.\n\nSeriously though, it's been 10 years since I worked in retail and this stuff still enrages me to be witness to. Why do some people think that other people who did nothing wrong should have to take a loss to cover their stupidity and ineptitude?",

If I'm gonna spend $money on a backpack, I want to choose a quality one I can use for a long time without it falling appart.\n\n$worker is next to me, sorting products unrelated to my purchase.

I refuse to watch this any longer.

If you get offended by customers being in the store you work at, you shouldn't work in retail.\n\nIn the end I waited until she entered some employees only area and finally made my purchase. I hope your day is as pleasant as you are.\n\nI still feel the rage flow through me. I might be overreacting here, or might be just like any other annoying customer out there.

For the title please imagine Spongebob.\n\n\nThis occurred on my University's campus, at a popular student run diner.  Some friends and myself (about 6 of us total) decided to go there for dinner one night because it was a nice change of pace and we could use our meal plans! Now, it was not at all unusual to get groups this big at the diner, in fact I'd say it was pretty usual because of what it was.\n\nThe evening starts out great, we all meet up, put our name on the waitlist and spend our time catching up.  After while, our name gets called, we sit and order.  \n\nNow I had a particular order I always got at this diner - chicken fingers with french fries, honey mustard sauce and pickles on the side! Not an overly complicated order and something that should be ready fairly quickly. \n\nAfter waiting sometime for our food a girl -who I might add, was NOT our waitress - brought out the food, well everyone's food but mine.  She said our waitress would be right out with my food, which I was fine with. Hey whats a few extra seconds when you're having fun with friends! \n\nBut then those seconds turned to minutes, and those minutes to quarters of hours, and eventually on to near an hour/ hour and a half.  I was absolutely STARVING as I had not seen hide nor hair of my food in that time. And, wouldn't you know it our waitress had not been back in our section at all during this time! Thank fully my friends gave me bits of their food to tide me over but still! Eventually (after One Eternity) our waitress stopped back and I was able to demand my food.  They forgot both the honey mustard and the pickles but dying from starvation I just inhaled it all right away!\n\nLater I tweeted about it to the diner's twitter handle, and they pretty much just said oops our bad! Glad you got to eat though! :/ Thanks, that definitely helps...",

        "text": "At my job, we often have to send important, time sensitive documents.  We usually use one of the major companies, because I see more of their trucks around, the drop boxes are convenient, and they let you put ground packages in the box, whereas their biggest competitor would make me find a store.  This company is giving me gray hair. Every time they mess up, which is often, to add insult to injury -- literally -- they lie, make false promises, and generally do nothing to help.  I could start a whole subreddit just about how much they suck (maybe someone has), but for now I'm just going to tell you about today's SNAFU.*\n\nI sent a letter out overnight, next day air, \"guaranteed\" (HA!) for delivery by 10:30.  At 11:30, I still haven't gotten my delivery confirmation email, so I track it on their website. It says \"In Transit: On Time\" which it clearly is not.  I do some work, and then decide to call at about 12:30. I eventually get a human. (Little tip here, if you don't want your customers to be seething maniacs when you talk to them, try to make it less obnoxiously difficult to get a human.)\n\nThe guy basically whips out his script and reads so fast that it's all a blur, but basically he says it's on the truck, but they had a large \"influx\" of packages, and he's running late, but it will be on time.\n\n&gt;Me: Um, clearly it's *not* on time, because it's almost 1:00.\n\n&gt;Him: Well, because of the large influx of packages, we changed the guaranteed time to noon.\n\n&gt;Me: Nice of you guys to change the rules without notification, but you missed your made-up late deadline, too.\n\n&gt;Him: It's definitely on the truck, the driver has a lot of packages. There was an influx of packages. It's holiday time.\n\n&gt;Me: First of all, are you telling me all bets are off for the entire month of December? Second, that makes no sense. Most Christmas packages on December 2nd are not going to be sent next day air, they're sent ground. Your driver is supposed to do all the air packages first.\n\n&gt;Him: He'll get to it, I promise. It's on the truck. \n\nSo at 2:30, still no email, I go back to the website to track it. Guess what?  They've erased the entire delivery progress history and changed it, and marked it with an \"exception\". Now instead of showing what time it was scanned as it got on the truck, and being marked \"on time\", it says at 10:00am, they \"left the package in the facility\" and had to reschedule for tomorrow.  Then at 11:15 it shows a \"destination scan\" which means it was scanned at its final warehouse before getting put on a truck. \n\nAnd the topper is that they won't process my request to get my money refunded pursuant to their \"guarantee\" until the package is delivered. \n\nWeasels.\n\n_____\n*SNAFU, for those who are unfamiliar, is Situation Normal: All Fucked Up.\n\n - - - - - - -\nEDIT: Son of a -- Just for kicks, I went online to check the status, since it's now 10:30 on the next business day.  It says \"first attempt made\" - meaning no one was there??? It's a law office, FFS!  This letter is cursed.\n\nEDIT #2:  Confirmed, people were in the office when the driver came by and left a \"we missed you\" post-it on the door without knocking or ringing the bell.  Our client actually sent a secretary from Manhattan to Brooklyn with a copy of the letter to hand-deliver it.\n\n",

        "text": "So I have a few stories about this one pizzeria we would order pizza from at my old place. But we'll just start with the funny one.\n\nAnd let's just say we don't have pizza very often, and when we do, it's like a heart attack on dough. 4x extra bacon crumble on one and 3x extra cheese on the other. We pay quite a bit extra for the extra toppings, but we understand - pay for what you want, and we also tip well. But because of this, they usually get the order wrong and the amount of bacon is literally a normal amount, so I usually I have to send it back for it to be right. Which I hate doing, but I paid for it, I want what I paid the extra $6-$8 for (depending on the size of the pizza).\n\nSide note: the first time I ordered it with 4x extra bacon, there was *a lot* of bacon on it, and so, I expect to be like the first time I ordered it, every time I order it. Though, this particular incident, I didn't have to complain about the amount of bacon. \n\nMe = M\n\nGM = Grandmother\n\nCS= Customer service\n\nOne night my grandmother and I decide to order pizza, because my mom and my best friend were over that day and well, we were too lazy to cook anything.\n\nSo I call it in, order the pizza, it arrives, I pay, I tip, I bring in my pizza, open it up... \n\n&gt; M: Uhm... .___.\n\n&gt; GM: Oh what now? (used to me complaining)\n\n&gt; M: .___. Why is there something green in my pizza?\n\n&gt; GM: (comes and looks) It's a bell pepper.\n\n&gt; M: I didn't order peppers... I hate peppers. \n\nSo I called it in, I said the other pizza was fine, just the bacon one had peppers on it, didn't look like much, but there were also some peppers underneath the cheese (I inspected it) and I did not want to eat it. \n\n&gt; CS: We're very sorry about that ma'am, we'll rush an order out to you right away. \n\nSo that's fine, new pizza got to my place pretty quickly, about 20 minutes or so rather than the normal 45. So I give the delivery guy the old pizza, he gives me the new one, I go inside, open up the box and just stare at it like .____. \n\n&gt; GM: What now????\n\n&gt; M: .____. (moves pizza around in box, start laughing) What even???\n\n&gt; G: WHAT NOW?\n\nSo I look up at my grandmother trying to hold in my laughter. \n\n&gt; M: Well nanny, they rushed it out sooo fast to me, that they forgot to cut it!\n\n&gt; G: What?\n\nSo I showed her and she began laughing as well, and so I called customer service back, not to complain or ask for a new pizza, or ask for a credit or anything stupid, just to let them know. (I don't only call CS to complain, I call to compliment, and apparently for things like this too)\n\n&gt; M: Hi, uhm, I called earlier about a pizza having bell peppers on it, and I just got my replacement pizza that was rushed out to me...\n\n&gt; CS: (it was actually the same lady I spoke to earlier) Yes, I remember, is there something wrong with this one too?\n\n&gt; M: No, no, well not really, I just wanted to compliment how fast the new pizza came out. \n\n&gt; CS: As I said we were rushing it out to you so you can enjoy your dinner! (In a happy voice, not rude or snarky)\n\n&gt; M: Yup, and they rushed it out so fast, they forgot to cut it. (Starts laughing)\n\n&gt; CS: ... What? \n\n&gt; M: It's not cut. Don't worry I'm not asking for a new pizza or anything, that would be stupid, I just thought it was funny.\n\n&gt; CS: (starts laughing) I have never heard of that happening before, give me one moment. \n\nAnd I hear typing on a keyboard. \n\n&gt; CS: Okay, for the trouble of this I'm going to go ahead and give you a $5 credit towards your next order. \n\n&gt; M: .___. I... I wasn't trying to ask for a credit or anything, it's alright.\n\n&gt; CS: I know, don't worry about it, in any case it was still a mistake on our part, and we're sorry for the inconvenience, \n \nSo I thought that was pretty awesome.\n\nAnd before anyone asks \"if they usually mess up the order and you have to send it back, why do you still order from there?\" Because their pizza is amazing, when they do it right.

        "text": "So, I'm working late by myself tonight.  My store is relatively slow today as it isn't a high priority stop on Black Friday.  So I let all of my TM's go early and because of this, I didn't have a lunch break nor did I bring anything with me as I wasn't expecting to send everyone home early.\n\nSo I ordered something delivered.\n\nThe driver gets here pretty quickly, as is usual for this place, he hands me my food, I hand him the money.  My total was $10.25 and I normally tip between 18-20% on everything. So I was gonna give the guy 2 bucks as a tip. \n\nNow this is where the M. Night Shamalamadingdong twist comes in.\n\nI handed him $15 (10 and a 5) and this kid says, \"Sorry, I don't have any change.\" and walks out the door.\n\nI was dumbfounded and stunned silent.  Before I could say anything else or get my own change, he was gone.\n\nI was gonna let it go but something just didn't feel right about the whole situation. So I called the store and asked the manager if it was common to send drivers out without any change.\n\nShe said it wasn't, apologized and said he was on his way back with my change.\n\nGut feeling confirmed.\n\nSo the kid comes back in and I can tell he's pissed. As i walk up to meet him, he plops my change on the counter says \"Here's your change\" and walks away.\n\nAs I counted my change I noticed an extra $5 bill.  I won't lie, for a split second I thought about keeping it for my troubles.  Ultimately I walked out to the guy and gave it back to him, letting him know that he gave me too much change. \n\nSeeing as how I already had my suspicions about this guy, I immediately called the manager back to let her know I had received my change. I also told her the the driver had given me $5 too much and had it in his possession, in case their tills came up short.  I mean, if he was willing to try and get a bigger tip by telling me he didn't have change, what would stop him from trying to get a \"tip\" from somewhere else?\n\nAs a Manager/Retail Slave myself, I cannot stand the stuff that people (customer and employee alike) try to get away with, nor can I tolerate shitty customer service.\n\nHad he been more gracious about it by offering to come back with change, asking if I had anything smaller or something to accommodate the situation, I probably would have just told the guy to keep it.\n\nHowever, him grabbing my money, telling me he has no change and making for the door made him untrustworthy.\n\nAnd untrustworthy employees are not good employees.",

        "text": "-I try to be as patient and understanding with retail workers (and people in general) as possible because I have worked retail before and remember it vividly. Well, the other day I was at a big box retailer that sells everything from food to toys to medicine. \n\n-There was only one register open and the line was so long it went into the clothing section so I decided to take my chances at self-checkout (SCO). I wait a few minutes and hop on the first open register. I scanned all of my items with no problem until I got to the beer (which I knew I would need approval for but figured SCO would still be easier).\n\n-My favorite cashier was working SCO that night, a sweet old lady who is a little bigger and has a little difficulty getting around and it was a mad house at the SCO there were lights going off for her help everywhere.\n\n-She was making her way around helping everyone and seemed to skip over me. After about 5 minutes of waiting this conversation occurred: **M=Me, C=Cashier, RC=Rude Customer**\n\n**M**: (waving slightly) &gt;Excuse me?\n\n**C**: &gt;Just give me one minute I have a lot of lights going off!\n\n*I was a little put off, but she's usually sweet as pie so I just figured she was having a bad day so I said nothing and continued to wait. While she helped RC. When she finished with RC she came over to help me.\n\n**M**: &gt;I'm sorry, I didn't mean to rush you. I didn't think you saw me.\n\n**C**: &gt;No, I'm sorry. It's just been a crazy day. I didn't mean to be rude to you. (as she's working on the SCO)\n\n**M**: &gt;Don't apologize, I used to work retail I understand how it is.\n\n**RC**: (yelling across the whole area) &gt;HELLOOOOO? YOU COMIN BACK TO HELP ME OR NAH?\n\nThe cashier and I exchange looks with each other like, is she serious?\n\n**RC**: &gt;IF YOU DON'T GET YA ASS OVA HERE AND HELP ME I'M WALKIN OUT WIT ALL DIS STUFF.\n\n-The cashier then finished with me, we wished each other a good night, and she went over to help RC who continued to be rude and obnoxious. While I bought a candy bar on a separate purchase and stopped at her cashier stand on my way out. I dug out my pen from my purse and wrote on the receipt \"I hope your night gets better &lt;3\" and left the receipt and candy and started to walk away. \n\n-The cashier then came up to the stand expecting to have to ring me out for a stupid candy bar and very kindly said \"Just this?\" To which I turned around and smiled as I kept walking. She read the note and profusely thanked me telling me I didn't have to do that for her. She then told everyone around her how sweet that was and how it made her night. I continued walking, blew her a kiss, gave her a smile, and walked out the door.\n\n*Moral of the story is that something as small as a $1.20 candy bar can make a person's day, so we should all just be kind to each other because you never know what someone else is going through.*\n\n-TLDR: Sweet cashier has awful night with rude customers, I bought her candy and she was extremely grateful and happy. \n\nEdit: formatting",

        "text": "Yesterday, as my SO was making the stuffing, he realized he did not have enough prunes so I made the obligatory, last-minute trip to the grocery.\n\nSince the turkey had to go into the oven soon in order to be ready for our scheduled dinner time, I quickly grabbed the prunes and the other three items we needed and headed for self-checkout because I'm in a hurry.\n\nNope. Self-checkout not open yet.  The store had been open for an hour.  \n\nNo worries, I go to one of the two open registers.  Except neither one had a cashier.  The manager walks by, sees me and asks \"Where are my cashiers?\"  Dude, I have no idea.\n\nHe gets on his radio and calls for cashiers and in a few seconds they both come out of an isle saying they'd been helping someone.\n\nOne of them starts checking me out and things go smoothly until she pulls the receipt from the register.\n\nC = cashier\nMe = me\n\nC: Oh, you can't read this.  I should have changed the tape.\n\nMe: That's okay, I don't need the receipt.\n\nC: Gets on the phone and calls for a manager.\n\nMe: That's really okay, I don't need a receipt.\n\nC: Starts to walk away from register to get a manager who's standing a few registers away.\n\nMe: Do I need to sign?\n\nC: No, I just need to get you a receipt you can read.\n\nMe: Thanks, I don't need a receipt.\n\nAt this point, I move to the end of the register counter so I can take my basket.  The bagger is still standing in front of my basket so I say \"Thanks!\" and move around her to take control of the basket.  She doesn't move.\n\nI'm starting to feel like these people are lonely and really want me to stay and keep them company.\n\nI start pulling my basket, essentially forcing the bagger to move or else get hit by the cart.  She finally moves aside, and I speed walk my basket the hell out of there.\n\nI half expected them to chase me down to give me a legible receipt.",
