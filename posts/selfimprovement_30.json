        "text": "I'm 24 and have been confused on what to do for the past two years and even more recently. Ive tried many different jobs, construction, delivery, restaurants(waiter), cabling, building garages, recently got laid off from garage job and have just been confused and lost.\n\n I was into martial arts my whole life competing and did mma for 4 years, got injured, stopped training as much and that's when I starting feeling even more lost. Just bouncing from job to job I'm not even sure that I want a career. I mean I want a better life and more money but don't see how that's possible right now. I have some interest in IT, business, computers but like I said don't know if I want a career or how I'd even get in. So I've kinda just been taking whatever jobs I can get that pay good. I've also been feeling depressed because I got laid off and things haven't been working out since I moved states and I'm trying to find the right medication. I really just want an online job or to play poker online(trying but unsuccessful) and be able to travel wherever I want, because I've always wanted to travel but don't have the money and feel a career would make it impossible. \n\nThat's really the only thing I want but I've lost interest in a lot of things like pursuing women, working out or martial arts. I know I need to improve to compete with other men in life but I'm just tired of everything. It all seems pointless. I know I shouldnt be this way but that's just how I feel.",

        "text": " Taking a clear and decisive decision is the key to making a long-lasting change. For instance, you can't overcome your addiction if deep down in your heart you're not sure if you want to. After all you started indulging in it for a reason. It brings you comfort, escape, pleasure.\n\nYou have to ask yourself **2 major questions:**\n\n1. **What would I lose from this change?** Really dig deep and figure out how is the thing you're trying to overcome serving you. You're smart, you wouldn't do it for no reason at all. There has to be a reason. Write down those reasons, cut and clear, doesn't matter where, you can use your phone's notes. It's important to be honest and non-judgmental with yourself. Be compassionate and understand your needs.\n\nAfter you've done that, your goal now is clarification. Think it through and ask yourself if this reason/gain are completely true. Some questions to guide you:\n\n\\- If I'm really getting pleasure from doing this, then why is it making me miserable?\n\n\\-If I'm getting comfort from doing this, then why does it make feel uncomfortable with myself?\n\n\\-If I'm getting stress-relief out of it, then how come my mind never seems to be at peace?\n\nThe habits you developed were useful for you to deal with certain circumstances in your life. They were answering your needs and they were valuable. Do not be hard on yourself for indulging in them. It was you trying to protect yourself. Be compassionate and understanding towards yourself.\n\nHowever, your life's circumstances have changed. Some of the habits that once served you, are no longer useful. You are still using the training wheels that have kept you safe and stable. But now all they are doing is slow you down.\n\n2. **What would I gain from this change?** This is the easy part. It's shouldn't be hard to imagine how much better your life would be if you changed. It doesn't have the mental burden of moving out of your comfort zone. Still, it's a crucial step if you want to make a solid and reliable decision. Therefore, Write down everything you would gain from changing. Examples: Peace of mind, Confidence, Freedom, Health, Self respect, etc.\n\nAfter you've done that, it's important to make it seem more realistic. How far down the road will you have to go in order to get those benefits? If you're only looking at the fruits you'll reap one year from now, your not looking at the full picture. Once you make the clear strong minded decision to change, some benefits will be instant. You will feel more self respect, more drive, more purposeful, more confident, more passionate etc. You know why? Because making a strong decision to change is already the first big step towards change.\n\nOnce you clarify your mind like that, you'll no longer have to force yourself to change. You've made change desirable as it should be. It's a win-win situations.\n\nI hope this was helpful, Good luck!",

        "text": "Many people in the self-improvement space frown upon reading fiction books because it isn’t necessarily productive. But if you look a little further, there are actually studies showing that reading fiction increases empathy, vocabulary and brain health in general. For example, reading about coffee or lavender actually lights up the smell regions of the brain.\n\nUsually, I read multiple books at a time. For example, I am currently reading *The Winter King* by Bernard Cornwell, *Psycho-Cybernetics* by Dr Maxwell Malts and *The Art and Business of Online Writing* by Nicolas Cole. I don’t have a schedule for reading, I just read whenever I have time and feel like it, and reading multiple books on widely different topics gives me more of a chance to be in the mood for reading one of these books.\n\nThe fiction books I read, tend to be historical fiction. Therefore, I learn a lot about different eras, cultures and events that happened at various epochs during the long history of humankind. This increases my general knowledge to levels my non-reading friends aren’t at by a long shot. It’s not the most practical knowledge to have, but reading a great story set in real historical circumstances only has upsides in my opinion. I also feel like this makes more of an interesting person, being able to relate current events to historical ones not many people have heard of.\n\nHere’s a short list of fiction books I read in the past and I’d recommend to a friend:\n\n* *Pillars of the Earth* by Ken Follett\n* *The Alchemist* by Paulo Coelho\n* *Palm Trees in the Snow* by Luz Gabas\n* *War and Peace* by Leo Tolstoy\n* *To Kill a Mockingbird* by Harper Lee",

        "text": "It is unfortunate that the purpose of our existence as a species is not known for certain. If it were, it could perhaps serve as a point of focus from which to shape our lives around. Since a definitive answer to this core question of why we are here is unattainable, we must content ourselves with creating and defining our own personal, unique-to-self purpose to pursue in order to give our lives meaning and direction. This purpose for living ideally includes the following:\n\n1. Deriving as many pleasures and joys from life as we can from the various sources from which they may be had. This is not only in line with our self-interest and natural drives, but also serves to honor those before us (both the known and unknown) who have lived and toiled in the past, whose efforts we have come to benefit from in the present. \n\n2. Being a source of such pleasures for others during our daily interactions and in our relationships. \n\n3. And—most importantly—having a clearly defined goal or ambition that will constitute our life’s work and enable us to move beyond a life of passive or semi-passive existence. \n\nThis endeavor should reflect our highest potential to produce a meaningful benefit, gain, or advancement for others and society over our lifetime, with the specific nature of such work being determined by our particular interests and aptitudes. Within this realm of our inclinations and abilities, I recommend choosing a singular main endeavor to label as our life’s purpose, and to devote the bulk of our energy and focus toward it. Beyond this, it is best to pursue not more than a few additional large goals, if any. And of them, let them be a separate aspect of our lives and of secondary importance in regard to the time and energy we allocate to them. This will ensure our efforts are not spread so far and wide that only mediocre success results, as pursuing several aims at once does not allow for the concentration of effort often needed for prolific achievement.  \n\nWhen contemplating having such a purpose and high aspirations, the question may be raised as to why many of us are not content with our current situation, and why we are seemingly instinctually inclined toward aims that may result in the aforementioned improvements and advancements for ourselves and others. The answer to this is because we understand that the continued development of ourselves and the communities we live in leads to a higher quality of life for all by enabling the obtainment of more resources, comforts, and security with less difficulty and effort. We want to succeed on a meaningful scale in this regard, not only for direct personal gain, but also to establish our societal value and worth as they may be justly derived through our successful contributions toward the progress of those ongoing human endeavors. \n\nTo the outside universe our lives may not matter, but to us in our isolated world it does, because each of us (and those who will live after us) feel and experience physical and psychological pain and pleasure as a result of being conscious physical beings. These very real things regulate our actions by motivating us to move away from things that cause pain, and toward things that result in positive emotions and pleasures. As a result, our minds and bodies have imposed self-importance upon us and our individual and collective conscious, and so we strive onward innately to satisfy their demands of health, psychological well-being (as may be more readily secured through favorable external environments and situations), and material abundance. It is our efforts and perseverance—the price paid—that makes us worthy of success in our common goal of securing this more ideal existence and improvements in the human condition, as they are the fruits of our labors. And if we are worthy of these good things by our efforts, then the endeavors we embark on to secure them become worthy as such, and success in them a noble measure of a life well lived.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe above content is among the opening pages of a book called Thoughts &amp; Counsel (the entirety of the opening pages can be read if you click on the ebook cover on amazon). The book goes into great detail about self improvement and the various avenues that a person can take to imbue their life with meaning and purpose. A great read!",

        "text": "Before starting to type about what I want, I've seen the pinned post of people being suicidal here - I want to note that I'm not suicidal, thanks.\n\n(I'm writing this post on a whim, so there isn't really any good structure to follow, and maybe I'll find myself repeating some things, so I'm apologizing in advance :). Also I've tagged the post as \"Vent\" but it's not really like that, but similar.\n\nMANY THINGS I WROTE ARE OFF-TOPIC, sorry.)\n\nI'm currently a senior high schooler, meaning that after around 4 months I'll be graduating and moving on with my life. Even though I'm saying I don't have a goal or interest, I do have a life plan of some sort, as I am planning to go to university.\n\nCurrently, I'm at a lost point in my life and have been for a while, everyone around me has a goal for their life, not a long-term goal, some of them have a short term such as \"I want to be a dentist\" or even \"I want to study medicine or finance\" or whatever for me, I don't have any such goal, not long-term neither short-term. Everyone around me is surprised to learn this when they ask, as (1) I'm a senior and planning on migrating for studies within less than a year and (2) I'm a top student in the school.\n\nBy lost point, I don't mean I don't know which field I want to study, instead I mean that I don't see a point in living, although that doesn't mean I'm seeking to die or do nothing, it's just, I don't really know what to do. If you ask me \"When was the last time you had fun\" I'll have trouble answering that. Same thing goes for the question of \"When was the last time you were sad\". I just don't feel grateful for being alive, nor do I feel the need to die.\n\nAlso don't get me wrong, I do have fun in the moment like when partying or whatever, but it's just that when recalling these memories, I don't feel like i had fun, or even have the feeling to seek that \"fun\" that I had.\n\nI've been like this for as long as I remember, except I do remember having fun in childhood, but it feels like I have the memories of another life.\n\n\\---\n\n(next section might come off as boasting, but i don't mean to boast, so please ignore it if it comes off as trying to boast)\n\nI'm... gifted?\n\n\\-&gt;(Academically and intelligently)\n\nI'm very fortunate academically, I learn stuff very quickly, and I memorize very easily (Read things once and I'm good to go), and usually very good in literature. In essay-writing all I need to do is read one or two samples, read the format/structure of the essay needed and be able to generate an essay of similar level.  \nThis is the reason why everyone is so surprised when I tell them I have no interest in any type of studying, not even in my best subjects (Mathematics and Physics, as i often find myself skipping many classes). It's also why many people around me have high expectations of me and my life, thinking I have everything planned and prepared, when I don't.  \nLast year I didn't study for any subject on final exams, well I lied, I did study but at the same day the exam was held (Flipping through books/pdfs/presentations 1-2 hours before the exam) and I scored the highest in my class.\n\nThis obviously created an issue of procrastination for me, I can write anything and everything in a short amount of time at a high level, but lately, it's gotten worse... \n\n\\-&gt;(Miracles? I don't know really)\n\nI've had repeated occasions where I didn't even write an assignment within the deadline, but the world created a scenario where that's okay... for example, once I didn't write a very important assignment, and when I went to school I didn't even bother trying to write, turns out on that day the teacher couldn't come as he got into an accident.\n\nA scenario of similar kind happened around 5-10 times this year only, and there were instances where it really was unbelievable.\n\n\\-&gt;(Body)\n\nI don't know what it's called (I think it's having high metabolism but I'm not sure), basically my body doesn't really generate that much fat, and no matter how much I eat, I don't really generate any fat. And don't mention me doing any exercises because there was a 6 month period where I would wake up, sit down on my laptop, and then go back to sleep while eating like a madman, but nothing changed.\n\nI don't really get sick all that much, especially compared to other people, I'm fortunate for this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith all these, people think I'm gonna be something or have something planned, but no. I don't even know why I wrote this.\n\n\\---\n\nI don't care what people think of me. I don't tend to have strong emotions or feelings towards others, with the exception of \"respect\". I do have immense respect for a few people in my life, such as my Brother, Parents, and a three of my teachers, with that said, I don't really have strong feelings for any of them. I've never really understood the reason for the existence of \"Family bond\". I've had experiences such as being 3 weeks to a month living alone, multiple times actually, but I've never felt the need to call or text any of my siblings or parents, but I do pickup or message them when they do.\n\nMy brother went to another country for studies 3.5 years ago, but I've only called him twice, once because I wanted to ask him something after he talked to my dad on speaker, and the other time was to ask about universities in said countries. - Oh and we don't text at all.\n\nWith that said, I see myself above everyone around me. Arrogant, I know, but at the same time, I see the people around me have better lives than me, they have hobbies and interests, non of which do I have.\n\n\\---\n\nI did have a goal when I was a kid, and that was to be an astronaut, however those feelings of interest and hype went away as I grew, I don't really see any goal that I have, outer space used to interest me, but not anymore.\n\nI don't have any types of hobbies or interests, I used to play a ton of video games, right now I don't have any video game that interests me.\n\nI don't have any feelings of love, neither sexually nor emotionally.\n\nThere were instances (when I was a kid) where I would be fascinated by things like Muay Thai, as it resembled the closest thing to a perfect bare-body fighting (to my knowledge). Which I feel like was the reason I was also interested in outer space, it was like a perfect world to me where you're free.\n\n\\---\n\nThe only reason I'm even going to uni is because I want to work to get some income for my father, as he is suffering a whole lot just for me (The school I'm attending is expensive, and he is doing this because of the good diploma), and I respect him for that and feel like I have a kind of debt to pay off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThings in here don't make sense, I wrote things I shouldn't and don't fit the topic I'm talking about here, but I wanted to just have freedom in writing whatever comes to my mind, so please excuse the poor writing that happened.\n\nIn conclusion, I don't think I'm supposed to be classified as alive, atleast by human-standards.\n\nI want to live, so please help me do so.\n\nP.S. If you have any questions regarding anything, even if it's off-topic, go ahead. I don't mind answering stuff :).",

I think I’m done with that. \n\nI tried HARD and I’m still trying because I don’t know what else to do but nothing is improving.\n\nI have ten million started projects, routines, regimens but nothing ever goes anywhere. Nothing feels good. Nothing makes me happy or feels like it paid off. \nI can’t stand (and never could stand) monotony and every little thing I do feels like NOTHING. I was hoping once I made it out of the hole it would get better but nothing ever feels like I’ve “done” something. \n\nI wanted to be an environmental attorney. I wanted to write books and I loved doing research. \nNow I have to smoke pot or I can’t keep food down before noon. I lost the weight but it didn’t matter. I graduated high school but it didn’t matter. I made friends and had fun but it didn’t matter. I still wound up stuck again. \n\n\nI’m so tired of staring at blank pages and empty in-boxes and the same empty rooms I’ve been living in for the last 5 years. \n\nAny advice?",

        "text": " \n\n**What is the pure and healthy relationship?**\n\nIt’s the feeling of being comfy and loved by your partner without being engaged to a reason unless it’s a personal one.\n\nPeople always tend to love others because the feel the same based on; their norms, perception, appearance, standard of living, culture, characteristics, loyalty level, manners, mindsets, race, customs, sexual, and religion orientations.\n\nIf you are the same you will accept and overcome any challenges and struggles along the way, at that point both partners will feel compassionate, enthusiastic to treat and interact like lovers, without noticing any showstoppers along their way.\n\nAny relationship without similarity from the above attributes, and acceptance from both parties, will be a consuming relationship and tend to lose/win from partner to another.\n\nAnd always one partner will play for his/her own without noticing the other’s essentialities to keep on, and it would be the worst nightmare and decision he/she has ever made.\n\n**What is the friendship?**\n\nIs when both friend or more treat each with respect, and love like brothers and sisters no matter the current events or circumstances or age, usually they are all for one and one for all, acting as real backbone to each.\n\nMost of us have friends to be better than their family members as they love, and serve each other’s blindly even if one party is traumatized or have any psychosis.\n\nThey will always stand on their ground, and back them up and all what they need to be on the first place without counting any blessings or looking for any benefits in return, and vice versa.\n\n**What is the toxic friendships?**\n\nPeople who know each other for a reason to gain benefits from each in different forms like; Money, exposure, Fame, attention, life opportunities, or in appropriate deeds and needs.\n\nThey cooperate and treat each for specific reason, once one party changed or don’t have any to offer on table they fade out.\n\n**Here are two forms of love which we all have throughout our life path:**\n\n**Seasonal love:**\n\nIs the love exposed by others for a reason, like when follower’s love celebrities when they are trendy, aggressor’s love when they can’t stop achievement storm of someone, hater’s love inorder to come closer to gain or to avoid confusion from others.\n\nThe only healthy seasonal love is when coworkers expose it, after achievements come across from one of them as he/she earned their respect and by his/her noticed milestones, and awards toward success.\n\n**Unconditional love:**\n\nIs the love directed from others without any valid reason, like; how kids love their parents, and how pets love their owners, without relying on circumstances, standard of living, or even appearance.\n\nAs one party is a care giver to the other one, and committed to him/her regardless any changes or challenges which life will grab along the way.\n\n**Why could someone have stuck on toxic relationship for a long time?**\n\nMost of us were or will be in toxic relationships, and unless being contained by the other partner.\n\nHe/she will be consumed and feel impressed, and confused, and they can’t move on or take any steps ahead for good life or change.  \n\n**Here are some of the common struggles which people face while keeping on toxic relationship**\n\n**Fear of change:**\n\nFear to live alone or other trustworthy partner as the individual used to be happy in the past, and fear their present and can’t even manifest it with different foresight.\n\nHowever, they didn’t enjoy the same level of happiness or satisfaction like before.\n\n**Loyalty trap:**\n\nPartner who stick and stand for each other because the feel it mandatory based on invalid reasons, and commitments which could be settled even after separation.\n\nAs one partner can’t see any good opportunities for him/her along the way in the future, and the other tends to be an outlier who doesn’t provide the same initial loyalty anymore.\n\n**Attachment issues:** \n\nSome partners are attached to the other partner because they are totally dependent on them and it’s one of the mental illness disorders, as the dependable partner can’t eat, drive, enjoy, initiate anything without the presence of the other party.\n\nThey are like the kids that feel dependent on their mother. Always dependent on his/her partner, and looking for orders to obey, and plans without taking any responsibilities along.\n\n**Relapsing and rebounds:**\n\nWhen partners stay engaged even while being skeptical and confused as one fear life after breaking up as he/she doesn’t remember how to handle life challenges alone, and excel life alone.\n\nSo they hate their current but can’t accept any changes, consequence while moving on.\n\n**Relationship toxicity vortex:**\n\nit’s one of the most confusing issues could any human being face, get manipulated with, as one partner always put fake blames on the table without relying to any valid reasons, and the victim feels that he is the mistaken one, even if he/she didn’t start to tackle or have any intention as well. \n\n**Intuitions Denials:**\n\nas one person is denying the other actions and recations, even if it’s not appropriate or wouldn't be accepted by others.\n\nLike; a woman who still engaged with a guy who got many fairs along the way, and she is still keeping on as she felt that she is the reason beyond all what he did, and she got her low self-esteem, and downgraded herself without noticing.\n\nAnd she/he keeps standing on the relationship as he/she stand for partner’s version which doesn’t exist anymore.\n\nThe victim always loves the feeling of being guilty and drama queen/king as they love the feeling of sorrow. and deny their intuitions and accept to continue like it never happened.\n\n**Worthless memories and emotions:**\n\nEvery relationship has its own glow since the start which may last for one partner and fader for the other.\n\nThe victim will accept because of the history of many good things in the past which he/she don’t feel or enjoy anymore.\n\n**Here are some steps to move on and overcome toxic relationships:**\n\n\\-List all losses as far as time, exposure, peace of mind, characteristics, and life opportunities.\n\n\\-Scale the severity of each from 1 to 10\n\n\\-See which part will Wight down\n\nRemember that no one will help you to change, and gain your fruitful results.\n\nAnd anything could change even the past its always your call.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nyour partner should be you source of enlightenment, and inspiration and the closest person who add value to your life, not the source of your struggles.\n\nYour partner should be always your backbone who back you up even in your hard times.",

I developed an inherent characteristic to self improve because I know my hard work pays off as I'd get perm positions from the sport teams and full time offer from jobs.\n\nFrom this, I naturally gravitate towards people that does more/tries more, whether that's friends contributing to society, putting effort to hobbies,  or in my case learning ways to improve myself at work and life tips to navigate life.\n\nNow comes my question, with this in mind how do you navigate people in your life that doesn't want to try harder/do better/be better? I've encountered family and friends where they either reach to a level where they are comfortable (reaching low 6 figure salary) or have a BF that makes up for their low salary by providing for them financially and it just bothers me so much. Sometimes I'd think to myself \" You can do better once you put your mind to it!\" I understand not everyone wants that but this realization just leads me to slowly distance myself from them.",

        "text": "I am male, 24, and have no idea what the heck I want to do with my life (although I am an optimist and there is a lot of stuff to be excited about.. I definitely do not suffer from depression). For about four years (mid-2019) I have suffered this issue where I have what feels like an extra 'organ' in the lower right part of my torso (just below my ribcage). I went to the doctor and actually had a scan done and there was nothing in that area so it is all in my head. The prevalence of this 'organ' is one where at times I can genuinely feel in pain, and the 'organ' is 'polluting' my bloodstream and wearing me down, like an anchor of sorts.   \nThis relates to my wider, unhealthy obsession with eugenics/genetics and how in my head all of humanity is inbred (and technically we kinda are; we descend from a few small groups in East Africa who then branched out and the populations continued to suffer bottlenecks as they migrated into areas like Europe and Asia, often caused by changes in climate and resulting food shortages). I think about how my own great-grandparent was the child of two parents who were half-siblings and thus, that makes me 1/8th 'inbred' (obviously it isn't quite as clear-cut as that). This is on my English side (I am half-English, half-Hungarian, and live in England) and it makes me uncomfortable that so much of my ancestry comes from an island, and islands are genetically isolated. Just for the record, this psychosomatic issue I have is very cyclical, so I can often go for a full week when I feel 'nothing' to do with this and things are ok, but then it will come back for another week, and this has been non-stop for four years. It's never painful enough to interfere with sleeping, though.  \nNow, so as you get an idea as to what my brain goes through, we switch to the wider subject of what one does with their time. I am a serial procrastinator, and as someone with Asperger's syndrome, I have both very specific interests but also no ability to filter out really mundane areas of those interests that are otherwise irrelevant. There is genetics/eugenics that I was talking about, but then again, I don't know much about that, because of my appalling attention span; it's just what I feel. I do go on long walks every day, which obviously are very healthy and good for mind and body, but other than that, when i am not in the company of friends (and I am lucky in that I have a very wide base of very close friends), I just spend all my time writing lists. Lists such as statistics of countries and their GDP, their age demographics, and their political leaders, and that is interesting, but the point is I do the SAME lists. When my friends were all watching TV series or getting into sports, I would just be writing endless lists over and over again. And this boils down to an area I really am trying to understand and that is reading. I think I honestly have a huge chip on my shoulder about anything related to reading/poetry in that I just can't really get into it as other people can. With that said, I 100% can say that I haven't really felt the need in other areas to 'go with the crowd'. Like in most other cases, such as movies, and music, I have always been totally content doing my 'own thing' and listening to music in my own way (I am a die-hard fan of music, I love it, I listen to it all the time, but I only focus on the instrumentation, even if if it is nice to sing along). But in terms of reading, I think if I really put the effort in, I could easily plow through a book, but then I nihilistically ask myself 'what is the point in reading OTHER people's words' (you do you), and I guess it's to just not be wrapped up in our own thoughts, but one could argue that most poetry/reading is just self-indulgent BS.   \nI can hardly, hardly call myself a nihilist, though, since I genuinely do have a very 'deep' and 'meaningful' bond with the music I listen to, and notice the aesthetic beauty and visual comfort a beautiful painting or a certain style of architecture has. I am irreligious and will likely stay so, but have actually just started going to church as well (partially for the communal aspect, but also just for some other perspectives). But the point is in this last area, I am all over the place, it's like I am very spiritual but ultra-nihilistic as well; I hate people with chips on their shoulders, and yet here I am ranting like the world owes me a favour.   \nIn short, I know this is a lot to unpack for anyone and I solemnly appreciate the efforts of anyone who does attempt to divulge this mammoth of a thread, but I am genuinely begging for some different perspectives because otherwise, I will be directionless. I haven't started talking to anyone at Church just yet about this, but I will I have spoken to my friends a bit about all this, but some of it's a bit embarrassing. Maybe this belongs in r/offmychest but I genuinely love a lot of the people on this thread who are so empathetic and fantastic to chat with (just like they are on said website, albeit it's a different vibe). On a concluding note, and maybe this is a symptom of bipolar disorder, I love being around people, but I also love my own company. I used to think I was an introvert, but then I realised if there was no-one around I would probs kill myself.",

        "text": "A couple years ago I was 365lb. I've lost weight since then (200lb), and started weight training, but I was never good at running. Since I was a kid I've had some pretty bad asthma that made running pretty painful for me. Even at the beginning of my weight loss, when I was just walking my dog on the Greenway it felt like the air was tearing my lungs apart.\n\nI've been reflecting on my self improvement journey a lot recently, and a couple of weeks ago I decided that I wanted to run the greenway mile in my town. I'll try to make it short, but walking that greenway with my dog helped me realize a lot about myself, and gave me the opportunity to grow as a person, so I figured that I would use it to help me again, and run the path with my dog, instead of walking it. \n\nSince I live in the middle of nowhere, and I don't have time to drive there everyday anymore, so I'm using a treadmill to train. \n\nThe first day was pretty rough. I have a hyposensitivity to pain (ASD), but my lungs have always been my kryptonite. The pain started about 20 seconds in, and it kept getting worse. About 1/16 of a mile in it felt like my lungs were sandpaper, and the air was razorblades, but I felt like I needed to keep going. I knew that if I didn't push myself past where I had always stopped before, it would never get any better, and I would never achieve my goal, so I made a goal of getting to an 1/8 of a mile.  I almost fell off the end of the treadmill before the end, but I made it. I spent the next 30 minutes with my face in the sink wheezing, spitting, and drinking water.\n\nMy lungs were pretty messed up for the next couple of days, so I didn't run, but as they were healing I realized that it was actually a lot easier for me to breathe in general. I was pretty confused, but after googling it, apparently running can help reduce the symptoms of asthma (I wish a doctor told me that before lol) I still have no idea if I needed to go that hard to help alleviate my asthma, but I don't really care because the feeling of breathing easy was worth the pain. \n\nThe next time I ran the pain was pretty much nothing by comparison, but I could only get to a 1/16 of a mile before I started losing a lot of power in my body, so I figured that was the point I would stop, and I would make it my goal to get one dot (1/64) of a mile further on the treadmill every day. \n\nI spent about a week doing that, until I accidentally knocked the on button (little plastic thing) out of the switch mid run. I looked at the treadmill, and realized that I had the treadmill on its maximum incline setting. I turned down the incline to the minimum, and I started running. I got to 1/4 of a mile today because of that. \n\nI don't know how long it will take me to get a mile on the treadmill, but if I can do a minimum of adding 1/64 of a mile on ever day, I should be able to do it in 48 days, but with the results today I want to try to do it before then. After that I'll take my dog to the Greenway, and go for a run.",

I haven't had sex in several years as living at home makes this a logistical nightmare.  \nWhen I was younger, I had such high hopes for my life. My dreams of success, travel and freedom have crumbled along with my dignity. \n\nAdmittedly, I am feeling particularly low today so this may come across as a self-pitying ramble \n(which it is 😂) but this is the reality of my situation. \nI would appreciate any practical advice or help on how to reframe my situation.",

Stand up and walk.  Channel that inner baby.  There is a level of toughness you can learn from it so you can expand that comfort zone.  \n\nIf a baby can challenge their comfort zone, going from crawling to walking, imagine what you can do now as an adult.  \n\nStop playing small!",

We also got into a pretty big fight about heritage and it separated me and my fathers family a little.

        "text": "What's the point in running a race if there's no finish line? If there's no obvious ending point? Without an end, you're working for no reason. Without an end, you're going to quit whenever you feel like it. Without an end, you won't stay focused. Everything is dependent on an end –– even your goals.\n\nI used to set a lot of goals with no end. One of my biggest goals was to write a book, and every blue moon, I'd have a massive drive to work on it. So I'd hop over to my computer, pull up google documents and start typing and typing. I'd go on and on for days, just putting the pedal to the metal, until suddenly, I'd stop.\n\nI'd look at all the words I typed, all the pages I filled, and told myself I'd get back to it. But I never did. I have tons of unfinished books that follow this same life cycle. I'd get pumped up, spend days working, look at all I'd done, and then, for some reason, I'd never get back around to it, even though I said I would.\n\nHas that happened to you? Have you ever made goals to work out more, save more money, learn a new skill, or keep your room clean, only to do it for a few days and then forget about them? Because for the longest,  I set goals just like that, but I never stuck with them until I learned the power of an end.\n\nThink about this, if there was a basketball game without a timer signaling the end or even a score, do you think the players would be going their hardest? Staying dialed in and focused, pushing through the fatigue and pain to stay in the game, even when their mind is screaming at them to stop? Of course not! There's no point.\n\nThey'd stop when they get bored shooting hoops or just don't feel like it. The minute the going gets tough, and they aren't sure if they have more, they wouldn't attempt to find more. The minute anything more exciting and new came around, they'd lose focus on the game itself and move on. \n\nBut the second you slap a timer on them, everything changes. The game is promised to come to an end; there's no more messing around. They're gonna put in the work, stay focused on their goal of winning and not let any mental or physical thing hold them back.\n\nEndings change everything\n\nIf you want to stay locked in and focused on your goals every day, no matter the circumstances, you've gotta give yourself an end – a finish line. That way, you'll know what you're aiming for, and you can keep your attention on that and work to get closer until you finally arrive.\n\nOne of my big goals has always been to get rich, and that's probably why I never have because getting rich isn't a finish line I can visualize. What does getting rich mean? How much money does it cost? I don't know.\n\nSo for years, I thought, \"One day, I'll be rich,\" but that day never came, and neither did a drive to figure out and do what it takes to get rich.\n\nBut everything changed when I sat down and thought about what does rich mean to me and came up with how much I'd need per month to reach my version of richness. Because I realized all I needed was $5000 a month. That's it.\n\nGetting $5000 a month became my finish line, and because that actually seemed attainable with enough time and hard work, my mind expanded with tons of ideas to reach that goal.\n\nWhenever I had days where I felt discouraged when a challenge popped up or I just didn't know what to do –– I'd close my eyes and envision the finish line. I knew what I was aiming for, and because it was realistic, it gave me the drive to keep showing up, learning, and putting in the work.\n\nI no longer set goals I forget about in a week because I have my eyes on the finish line, encouraging me every day to step towards it, and you can do the same.\n\nWhatever goal you have, ask, when will you know you've achieved it? What has to happen? And please, be realistic with the end goal. \n\nIf you want to make more money but say you wanna make 1 million in a year, there's no way you can see the finish line.\n\nIt's hundreds of thousands of miles away. You're gonna be running that race, out of breath, searching for that end in vain. And the moment it gets too tough, or you just don't feel like continuing, you'll give up.\n\nBut imagine if you set the goal to make $15,000 in a year? Now, you can see the finish line, and even though it's still freaking far away, the fact that you can **see it** makes all the difference. Because now, when you're in the pain cave, and you wanna give up because you're doubting yourself, all you gotta do is look ahead and see that finish line.\n\nYou can get there –– it's totally possible as long as you keep going.\n\nThat finish line will keep you focused, push you to show up, and motivate you when nothing else will.\n\nThink about what it really means to have reached your goals. If you want to write a book, it could be filling 15 chapters with adventure. If you want to work out more, it could be building strength to lift a 150-pound weight. If you want to have more money, it could be saving $2000. \n\nEach of these ends is realistic and will serve as a huge motivator and keep you focused on what needs to get done to cross the finish line to your goals.\n\nAnd then, of course, you can set higher goals with a new end to start the process again. But without an end, you'll never truly start, so make sure you have one.\n\nNow remember, time is passing anyway. So you might as well start taking action and working on your goals right now.",

        "text": "Taking a clear and decisive decision is the key to making a long-lasting change. For instance, you can't overcome your addiction if deep down in your heart you're not sure if you want to. After all you started indulging in it for a reason. It brings you comfort, escape, pleasure. \n\nYou have to ask yourself **2 major questions:** \n\n1) **What would I lose from this change?** Really dig deep and figure out how is the thing you're trying to overcome serving you. You're smart, you wouldn't do it for no reason at all. There has to be a reason. Write down those reasons, cut and clear, doesn't matter where,  you can use your phone's notes. It's important to be honest and non-judgmental with yourself. Be compassionate and understand your needs. \n\nAfter you've done that,  your goal now is clarification. Think it through and ask yourself if this reason/gain are completely true. Some questions to guide you: \n\n\\- If I'm really getting pleasure from doing this, then why is it making me miserable? \n\n\\-If I'm getting comfort from doing this, then why does it make feel uncomfortable with myself?\n\n\\-If I'm getting stress-relief out of it, then how come my mind never seems to be at peace?\n\nThe habits you developed were useful for you to deal with certain circumstances in your life. They were answering your needs and they were valuable. Do not be hard on yourself for indulging in them. It was you trying to protect yourself. Be compassionate and understanding towards yourself. \n\nHowever, your life's circumstances have changed. Some of the habits that once served you, are no longer useful. You are still using the training wheels that have kept you safe and stable. But now all they are doing is slow you down. \n\n**2) What would I gain from this change?** This is the easy part. It's shouldn't be hard to imagine how much better your life would be if you changed. It doesn't have the mental burden of moving out of your comfort zone. Still, it's a crucial step if you want to make a solid and reliable decision. Therefore, Write down everything you would gain from changing. Examples: Peace of mind, Confidence, Freedom, Health, Self respect, etc. \n\nAfter you've done that, it's important to make it seem more realistic. How far down the road will you have to go in order to get those benefits? If you're only looking at the fruits you'll reap one year from now, your not looking at the full picture. Once you make the clear strong minded decision to change, some benefits will be instant. You will feel more self respect, more drive, more purposeful, more confident, more passionate etc. You know why? Because making a strong decision to change is already the first big step towards change. \n\nOnce you clarify your mind like that, you'll no longer have to force yourself to change. You've made change desirable as it should be. It's a win-win situations. \n\nI hope this was helpful, Good luck!",

Those who are also abusive, emotionally unavailable, borderline disrespect me.\n\nI was seeing a guy and we became more of a FWB and I made a loottt of excuses for him (thinking I was confusing with my actions, how we don't owe each other anything, etc), but when it comes down to it, he straight up sucked and took advantage of me, consciously or not.\n\nI'm talking to another guy now who treats me so well but I'm so attached to the first guy and I hate myself for it. I always go for the guy that has \"more trauma\" because I feel like they can understand and relate to me better and not think I'm \"crazy\" or that I have a lot of \"baggage\" or that my family is \"too much\". I know a really good guy will look at my character and be able to separate that from the circumstances I was born into but I'm having trouble with it still.\n\nThe new guy I'm seeing comes from a wealthy and emotionally healthy family and I'm really intimidated by that. He seems really into me but I'm still thinking about the guy that doesn't text me for weeks after we have sex and only messages me when he's on vacation and horny.\n\nHow do I be smarter in this type of situation? I want to be able to cut ties with the emotionally unavailable guys or guys who do me dirty. I read this in another post that someone said I feel guilty for not talking to my dad because I'm mourning the lost of what could have been a good relationship with my dad, not the actual relationship. I feel like it's the same for guys I date. I always mourn what could be or the potential so I latch onto it only to get disappointed. I'm very self aware, but I do stupid things.",

        "text": "Time is at a premium these days. It’s hard to find anyone that complains about having too much time on their hands. Most of us are so busy with work, family, and various obligations, there’s little time left to do the things we’d really like to do!\n\nIt’s not easy to find time to pursue your passions, but there will be a way.\n\n### Use these techniques to create the time you require for important pursuits: \n\n**Decide what you want to make room for.** The best way to motivate yourself to create more free time in your life is to identify what you want to make time for! What are the most important things you’d like to spend more time on?   \n \n\n● Figure out how you’d spend that extra time and make sure you have some good reasons. Create a list of reasons that give you an emotional response. Being logical is unlikely to inspire you.  \n \n\n**Use your mornings wisely.** Most people waste their mornings. They stay in bed as long as possible and barely manage to get to work on time each day. Make the most of your mornings. Go to bed earlier and get up earlier.  \n \n\n● It’s often easier to do something worthwhile in the morning than in the evening. What are you missing by going to bed earlier? Probably not a lot.  \n \n\n**Understand the ways you waste time.** We’re quite ingenious at wasting time. Watch yourself for a day and write down all the ways you waste time. When you understand where your time is leaking away, you can start working on solutions.  \n \n\n**Make a schedule.** A schedule can keep you on track and help to ensure that your time is being spent wisely. A schedule can help to minimize the amount of time you waste. You can also build time into your schedule to do the things you enjoy the most.  \n \n\n**Delegate.** Create more time for yourself by utilizing the people around you. This can work at work and at home. There’s a good chance that someone in your life would benefit from being delegated to. Put your employees, coworkers, children, and partner to work! A little help can free up quite a bit of time.  \n \n\n**Prioritize and eliminate.** Perhaps you just have too many non-essential things going on in your life. It might be time to cut back on a few of those obligations.  \n \n\n● Take a look at everything you do each day/week/month and think about how much value those things add to your life. You can probably find something to remove from your life.  \n \n\nYou can find time if you have a good enough reason! **Determine what you want to create time for and make it happen.** Delegate, schedule, eliminate, and avoid wasting time. What are you willing to give up to spend time on the things you love?\n\nI have posted further quick reads on my own little corner of Reddit – it would be great to see you there.",

        "text": "This will probably be a long post so pardon me.\n\nI am a 23 year old male engineering student. Six years ago, after graduating high school with not so stellar grades, I became aware of a problem which I assume I've always had but one that hasn't started to affect me before that point, before I started having my own goals and had to make conscious, everyday, decisions to keep progressing towards these goals: extreme lethargy and Procrastination.\nI was very ambitious and had a lot of goals coming out of highschool, despite the downfall I've had in the ,I was sure I'd be able to \"fix it\".\n\nEver since, I've been trying everything to try and break free from this curse and start being the person that I want to be: I set clear goals,Journaling, Detailed plans and daily to-do lists,reading countless self-help books, meditations...But to no avail, It only got worse and worse gradually, I failed the majority of my freshman year courses and had to transfer to another university, where I barely passed freshman and flunked the following year and yet again was forced to repeat it...It didn't stop at Academia either, I gained 20kg over the last 3 years and I began to withdraw from meeting with the few friends (Again, because of a mixture of not maintaining relationships and social anxiety which makes it hard to initiate contact in the first place) that I had. I felt like I had nothing to add to the relationship except lamentation, I gradually stopped answering calls until we completely lost contact. The only person I have left is a friend who unfortunately is in a similar situation...we kept each other alive, made plans together and tried to build each other up but we were met with failure after bloody failure. It was not out of lack of motivation or purpose, we knew exactly what we wanted from our lives, we were just Unable to follow up on ANYTHING consistently. Even things we used to be \"good\" at.\n\nWhat kept me from ending it uptill now was the unconditional love and support of my family and my friend, to whom I was determined to pay back this kindness by  making them proud and not being a complete failure. But after six years of trying, it seems so hopeless now...and I can't keep being a parasite forever.\n\nI'm very tired of living in this perpetual nightmare, I will give myself the period of one more semester to turn things around to atleast be going in the right trajectory. So i wanted to know if anyone had at some point found himself facing the same problem, and if they managed to get themselves out, Any advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\nTLDR; Lack of self-discipline has slowly but surely destroyed every aspect of my life, I've been trying to change for a long time, but i never could. If you've had a similar curse , I'd appreciate any advice and I'd like to hear your story.",

My mom never had it in her to leave, and she wanted us home with her all the time. She didn’t like it when we made friends because she wanted to be our friend. I developed a crippling drug addiction in high school, faced some consequences, did some time, then I got out and got sober through the 12 steps, which I’m still quite active in. I’ve been sober for 10 years now, engaged to a great woman and we have a 6 month old daughter. For the last 7-8 years I’ve been trying to help my two brothers who struggle with addition however I could. Setting an example, taking them to meetings, introducing them to good people, whatever. Both of them moved back in with my mom and the old toxic reunion was back. Things have been spiraling into darkness ever since. They call me when shit hits the fan, I get emotionally invested and try to help, they don’t do anything about anything, then I’m the asshole for following up on it. It’s affected me so much to where I started going to Al anon. My most hateful brother finally crossed his last boundary and I let him know I don’t want to talk to him anymore until he gets help. That’s when all hell broke loose, my mom sicked my siblings on me like they were dogs. I’ve been harassed all day, texts, phone calls, kicked off shared streaming platforms, thrown into group chats where they were talking shit about me. My brother used his partners phone to text an absolutely vile message, My mom tried to get my phone turned off. My one glimmer of hope was my sister, she has always seemed somewhat level headed, but nope, she called me to blame my brothers addiction on me and that she was better than me because she never needed AA. I am truly and sincerely disgusted. I’ve never experienced anything like this, but if anything this made it clear I made the right decision. I have my own family and peace of mind to protect. I cannot imagine letting them back into my life until a good deal of time passes and work on their part has occurred. Has anyone else dealt with this?",

Not sure why Fall semester always goes great and then Spring feels so dreadful. Any ideas on how to correct this habit before it’s too late? Anything that’s worked for you guys? Trying to work on my discipline and slowly get better at it but I’m worried I might be in too deep to finish this semester off strong.",

When I look back, I can't think of any way I couldve changed those outcomes. I just hate how when I take directions, I somehow make all the wrong choices, like being told by google to take a train that only runs once a day without being told so.\nBoth my friends low-key put pressure on me to please them, and now I feel like they look down on me. They are always questioning every decision. I feel so rushed all the time. I dont know how I can stop this behaviour, why I am more prone to make mistakes that seem so foolproof at first glance. The shame is too overwhelming and I just want to go somewhere alone to recover, because I dont want to bring everyone else down by mood.",

Apart from the 3-4 times a  week I go out and hangout with my friends and school, I am home as I  live in an exurb where it is basically impossible to get anywhere  without a car (I have a bike, but my parents do not let me use it  because they deem the roads to be too dangerous). I spend this time at home productive. I have a low screentime of around 10-20m on my  phone a day, I typically read for 3 hours a day, I study the bible daily, I workout for an hour, I get up early, I usually get all my  homework done and spend a lot of time studying, but eventually this gets dull. By no means do I stop these habits, or lessen these habits, but  life, staying at home, just eventually gets boring. I eventually start  thinking worse of myself the more I stay home and I realize I cannot do  much about it, as I cannot really, consistently pursue many outside  activities due to my age (not being able to drive) and my hard-working  parents who are always at work all the time (by no means am I trying to  disrespect them or speak negatively of them). I just wanna learn how to  stop being sick of staying home until I  can actually pursue outside activities and work by getting a driver's license or convincing my parents to let me bike. If anybody has any solutions on how to get into outside world more, convince my parents to let me bike, or  tips on how to start loving this time and stop getting sick of this  time, I would love to hear them.\n\nNote;\n\nIt  wasn't always like this. I used to enjoy being at home. But this was  back in times where I was an unproductive, ungrateful, lonely and  unhealthy child who would spend all of his time playing videogames and  watching movies, and I don't ever, ever wanna go back to those times. I have greatly improved since those times and now greatly athletic, have many great and loyal friends, don't touch videogames, and do great in school.",

Now, I just feel that worrying so much makes the actual outcome less horrible than the one I imagined. So, it better to worry so even if the outcome isn't great it's at least better. Sometimes I worry that if I don't worry about things, then I won't be able to fully enjoy and appreciate those things. I feel I have to worry that I will never make any friends. So, that is I do manage to make friends, then I will feel like I suffered so much for this so I'm going to appreciate and enjoy it more. I just worry about so much from finances to career to love. And I know that worrying won't change things. But, I think deep down I believe that worrying so much will magically make the world give me a break or something. It's honestly so exhausting.

In plus of having more control of yourself, you will come off as a better listener (which is 2/3 of the equation in any conversation).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you want to get started with meditation, try Medito.

This last one truly made me realize that I need to be single for a long time. I haven't been single for longer than a month since I was 13. I don't even know how that's possible, but I guess it is😂 granted. This would be easier if I had a lot of friends, but with moving around a lot, I only see my friends maybe once a year.

Luckily the situations esolved themselves but I want to help people.\n\nI can't really help myself either. I freeze up in the same situations. I'm just glad it was in public. I carry a knife but my old coworkers made fun of me for it. I'm small and lanky and weak and they thought me stabbing a dude would be similar to a pin prick.\n\nI want to stand up for others and myself but I keep freezing up and then I feel guilty for being so weak.
