[{"title":"PotW #54: Bowen - Piano Sonata no.5 in f minor","author":"number9muses","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/classicalmusic\/comments\/11qazoa\/potw_54_bowen_piano_sonata_no5_in_f_minor\/","text":"Welcome back everyone to our sub\u2019s Weekly Listening Club! Was on hiatus for our New Years \u201cFavorite Composer Bracket\u201d, will now go back to our Monday posts. Each week, we'll listen to a piece recommended by the community, discuss it, learn about it, and hopefully introduce us to music we wouldn't hear otherwise :)\n\nWe left off with Mozart\u2019s [Rondo in D Major](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/classicalmusic\/comments\/101gknk\/potw_53_mozart_rondo_in_d_major_k485\/) for piano. You can go back to listen, read up, and discuss the work in the comments. \n\nOur latest Piece of the Week is York Bowen\u2019s **Piano Sonata no.5 in f minor (1924)**\n\n\u2026\n\n[**Score from IMSLP**](https:\/\/vmirror.imslp.org\/files\/imglnks\/usimg\/e\/e1\/IMSLP394051-PMLP637614-Bowen_-_72_Sonata_in_f_Minor_op_72.pdf)\n\n\u2026\n\nsome listening notes from [Francis Pott](https:\/\/www.hyperion-records.co.uk\/dw.asp?dc=W6232_66838)\n\n\n> Since the Piano Sonata No 5 in F minor Op 72 was issued by Swan only a year after the Short Sonata, publication years and opus numbers may mislead us as the date of actual composition, prodigious though Bowen\u2019s work rate was. Publication preceded the work\u2019s first performance, given by Bowen in London in January 1924 and favourably received by audience and press alike.\n\n> The Sonata\u2019s arresting triadic opening generates material both for the first movement, a spaciously dramatic conception with an angular melodic principal subject, and (in altered guise) for the driving rhythms of the finale. Between lies another fragile reverie whose irregular five quavers to the bar again hint at MacDowell\u2019s lyrical artlessness in similar contexts (though one improbable precedent for a slow movement in quintuple time is Chopin\u2019s early C minor Sonata Op 4). Bowen\u2019s scheme as a whole might suggest an attempt to mirror Beethoven\u2019s \u2018Appassionata\u2019 in entirely personal terms (the two works are in the same key and feature slow movements seemingly cowed into submission by what surrounds them). However, it is here that one finds the beginnings of an acceptable \u2018fit\u2019 for the \u2018English Rachmaninov\u2019 label. Since Bowen included in his performing repertoire some of the twelve Transcendental \u00c9tudes by Sergei Lyapunov (1859\u20131924), one wonders whether he knew Lyapunov\u2019s powerful Sonata (also in F minor) Op 27, published by Zimmermann in 1908. There are distinct similarities between the two composers, both in the instinctive brilliance of their piano writing (recorded evidence survives of Lyapunov\u2019s formidable virtuosity in the last of his own \u00c9tudes) and in their tendency to conceive primary material which, already striking in itself, somewhat resists fruitful deconstruction during sonata development sections. In view of the range of colour and texture achieved on more episodic terms by both composers, it would be mean-spirited to criticize this.\n\n> Unusual by now among his British contemporaries for coming into his own particularly in last movements, Bowen returns to compound time for an exhilarating virtuoso climax to the Sonata. Summoning greater terseness and astringency in the striking juxtaposition of unrelated triad chord formations, he vividly conveys his own enjoyment of the proceedings. Fittingly, this reminds us that he was a fastidious craftsman who would have shared Medtner\u2019s devotion to a Platonic ideal of composition, attaching no less importance to the spiritual consolations attending its pursuit than to its consummation in performance. In this respect, as in his structural preferences, Bowen remains in a sense an innately Classical type of late-Romantic composer.\n\n> Towards the end of the Sonata occur two reminiscences of its opening, one hushed, the other (ffff grandioso) casting all caution to the winds before a storming octave peroration. The coda as a whole bears a striking resemblance to its counterpart in the Sonata Op 25 (1954) by Bernard Stevens (1916\u20131983), a composer comparably neglected among the ensuing generation.\n \n\n\n**Ways to Listen**\n\n* YouTube - [Jeremy Filsell](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BI7-r0D42EQ), **video includes score**\n\n* YouTube - [Wouter Smits](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Nl7g4WG6tpk)\n\n* Spotify - [Joop Celis](https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/album\/34vu1cMvoecWzlAUQVT0Vs?si=aA7E7JusTzWkuboz_2FgIQ)\n\n**Discussion Prompts**\n\n* What are your favorite parts or moments in this work? What do you like about it, or what stood out to you?\n\n* Do you have a favorite performance or recording you would like to recommend?\n\n* In the notes, Pott says that Bowen\u2019s material \u201cresist[s] fruitful deconstruction during sonata development sections\u2026\u201d but admits that he thinks this criticism ignores the value of color and texture that Bowen creates. How do you feel about this argument? When listening to a piano sonata, does proper form and thematic development matter more than tone-color and texture? Does it even make sense to pit different aspects of music against each other like this to determin \u201cquality\u201d?\n\n* Have you ever performed this before? If so, when and where? What instrument do you play? And what insights do you have from learning it?\n\n...\n\n\n*What should our club listen to next?

The music was amazing and not like the stuffy old music I had imagined. But what really stood out to me was how the film used music in unexpected and brilliant ways.\n\nEarly in the film, there's a scene where Salieri, an unknown enemy of Mozart, looks at Mozart's transcripts. As Salieri flips through the pages, the music from the transcripts plays in the background. It's a subtle but incredibly effective way of communicating Salieri's envy and frustration at Mozart's genius.\n\nLater in the film, there's a scene where Mozart and Salieri, who is still pretending to be a friend, write music together. The scene is beautiful and poignant, with Mozart and Salieri working together to create something truly magical. However, it also highlights the struggle of making music when one aspires to be great. Salieri, who secretly harbors hatred towards Mozart, doesn't fully understand what Mozart is trying to do, and the two composers clash. But even in their conflict, there is an undeniable beauty to the music they create and a way for Salieri to learn from a master if he would reject his own pride.\n\nThe music in this scene is particularly stunning, with the two composers working together to create a piece that is both complex and deeply emotional. The film does an incredible job of capturing the creative process, as well as the tension and rivalry between Mozart and Salieri.","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1678733570.0},{"title":"Is this video still up anywhere?

At about 47 seconds in, and then repeated multiple times throughout, was a melody I was sure I had heard somewhere hundreds of times before. This was my first time knowingly listening to the piece, although it\u2019s always possible that I\u2019ve heard it in a film or commercial. Was it lifted for some pop song? A TV theme tune? A popular ringtone?\n\nIt took me a while, but I eventually placed it. I\u2019ll put it behind a spoiler alert in case you want to listen to Ferranc\u2019s theme first to see if you can guess it.\n\n>!It\u2019s the theme song to NPR\u2019s All Things Considered, written by Don Voegeli in 1971, which I have heard not hundreds but thousands of times in my life. !<\n\n(Hm, turns out you can't put a link in a spoiler. You can hear the newer piece [here](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Qkq5CFGOBH4&list=RDQkq5CFGOBH4&start_radio=1).)\n\nI did look up the sheet music to both and confirmed that they are almost entirely identical, with just one additional passing tone in the earlier work.\n\nWhat\u2019s more interesting is that I also came across [this video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fWs25AilZ1k) in which someone pointed out that this theme is also used in >!John Williams\u2019 1975 score for Jaws!<, which most of us here will probably not find too surprising. But no one else, as far as I can tell, has mentioned the coincidence with Ferranc\u2019s quintet, so I am either the first person who has noticed or, more likely, just the first person who found it interesting.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678769882.0},{"title":"Haydn - String Quartet, Op. 76, No. 3","author":"ViolinOutOfTune","url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/qoWdtGUe5fc","text":"","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678748299.0},{"title":"Komm, s\u00fc\u00dfes Kreuz, Bach, aria from St. Matthew Passion","author":"ommummo","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/classicalmusic\/comments\/11qk2f2\/komm_s\u00fc\u00dfes_kreuz_bach_aria_from_st_matthew_passion\/","text":"This is my first reddit post.

She is a very good teacher but strict as can be. We have had less than serious moments together and made each other laugh, though. We had online lessons for much of COVID and only resumed in-person this school year through a music college. I am not going into music but just finishing out this last year of lessons and concerts, probably won\u2019t get the opportunity for another comp.\n\nI\u2019ve noticed that it\u2019s not just strictness but also personal factors that have affected her attitude towards me. She is a young grandmother and has to care for her daughter\/grandchild, which is exhausting; she has other, younger students who I think she gets even more frustrated with but can\u2019t really take out her anger on because their parents are there; she is from the Soviet Union, so gives 0 fucks about mental health and has a very hardass attitude. Believe me, it\u2019s tough trying to get Russian\/Soviet adults to be more lax and open-minded. \n\nBecause I\u2019m older, at a higher level with more expectations, and come to lessons alone, I think she finds it easier to scream at me. I also come from a very musical family and have perfect pitch. I take a lot of the abuse quietly, and I only sometimes say mildly snarky\/petty things or try politely hinting that this teaching method is ineffective, but most of it sails right over her head and I have been afraid to confront her. Anything I have tried gets shut down. I try to endure it to just finish out the year.\n\nThe thing is, I have my problems too. I am working on myself and starting a new, healthier life, but I still come to my weakest point each Friday night, when I collapse into bed after getting 5-6 hours of sleep each night and wake up only a few hours before our lesson. I have also been practicing no more than a half hour each day, with less than ideal technique too, which just isn\u2019t ok at this level. If I wasn\u2019t in a bunch of AP classes and extracurriculars I would try for an hour as a minimum. I have also been through mainly emotional and verbal abuse from so many other people, I guess I reached a breaking point yesterday.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult for me to focus on these Saturday mornings, usually tired and especially since I think I have undiagnosed ADHD, but I try. When the screaming and constant berating starts though, I tend to zone out. It\u2019s not voluntary, I just can\u2019t take it. On Saturday, she just wouldn\u2019t stop and kept scribbling all over my sheet music to emphasize markings already there that I hadn\u2019t done right. I asked her to stop and was literally erasing them because they were overlapping and hard to read. But she wouldn\u2019t. So I couldn\u2019t help it, I was so upset and overwhelmed that I started crying. I already feel disrespected enough as a human by so many people. It\u2019s too much bullshit for anyone to take.\n\nShe had a really shitty reaction at first and was like \"why are people so touchy these days, how are you going to survive on your own?\" Which just drove me to tell her flat out that I had asked her to stop because the markings were literally becoming impossible to read and focus on. She seemed to accept this, and I added, \"I suppose it would be too much to ask you not to constantly yell at me, too.\" She said \"Ok well you don't hear me\" which is bullshit because she sits literal inches from me. It's a focus, not a hearing issue. So I said, \"Yelling doesn't exactly get the words into my head.\"\n\nI don't know how, because she is such a hardass, but she seemed to understand and calmed down. The lesson got better, unsurprisingly. I was fucked up from the breakdown but really tried to prove that not yelling at me is a more effective ay of teaching, because it is! At the end, she apologized for yelling at me, I kind of brushed it off like \"it's ok,\" maybe because that's an automatic reaction I used to have to abuse or belayed I won't have to see her after June. She actually said \"No, it's not.\" Which is surprising because very few people have said that to me after mistreating me. Since my parents already paid for my tuition for the year, I don\u2019t think it was an attempt to keep me as a client, either, and she has plenty of students.\n\nI guess I should stand up for myself more, as should anyone with a teacher like this. You deserve better regardless of how much the lessons are or how many hours you practice.","upvote_ratio":0.72,"created_utc":1678650639.0},{"title":"I just came across this spectacular performance by identical twins!

My approach was to get as much info as possible about work, period, etc, even I\u2019m completely dumb about music theory. Main goal was to understand what artist wanted to express, what should I feel, how should I feel\u2026 \n\nUntil last night when I decided just to listen. Beethoven\u2019s 7th Symphony. After listening to the whole piece for the first time I had a feeling of calm fulfillment, it wasn\u2019t excitement, it is a feeling when you talk to person you have very strong connection and you\u2019re just grateful to experience that moment. \n\nFirst movement: in the first part I\u2019ve experienced feelings of innocent happiness, like when I was a kid. But later during the movement something started to change - feeling started becoming more diluted, something like when you want more and more stuff and you keep getting them, but each time happiness is decreased, diluted. \n\nSecond movement: emotion of realization mixed with emotion loneliness. Similar feeling to standing in the church and praying after some event that changed your perspective in life. \n\nThird movement: feeling when you work hard, fight hard through life, without much excitement but with calm determination. And I felt this part is not about the goal, it is about you fighting through life according to how you\u2019re designed. Everything is moving you to equilibrium. \n\nFourth movement: I have those moments in life where I\u2019m just full of joy, like some kid, but also in the same time feeling that joy in much broader way. Feeling joyful because you\u2019re alive and you\u2019re existing and feeling the whole world. Everything is mixed up here. After listening I had a feeling I learned something new, feeling of fulfillment. \n\nSorry for this much text, but needed to express my main point that from now on im just going to listen and feel and literally talk to the pieces. \n\nIm using this Idagio app, it\u2019s pretty nice.

The Concertgebouw orchestra played Rachmaninoff\u2019s second piano concert and Rachmaninoff\u2019s rather unknown first symphony. They were being conducted by ex chief conductor Ricardo Chailly! The piano was played by Mao Fujita.\n\nThe second the piano started playing I immediately got goosebumps, and the moment that the orchestra joined in it truly felt like I had landed in a rising storm. The acoustics of the Concertgebouw really are so amazing, they manage to flabbergast me every time. I have always liked the second piano concerto, but I think now I like it even more! The whole experience was just absolutely mindblowing, and so, so impressive. I hadn\u2019t listened to classical in a while and the last time I went to a concert was 2 months ago, but now I remember why I love Russian music so much again.\n\nThat the second piano concerto was my favourite does not mean that the unknown first symphony wasn\u2019t good! It flopped when it first came out, and it was received so badly that Rachmaninoff actually got depressed. The first symphony is definitely different from his later work, but it is unmistakably Rachmaninoff. It is a rather fragmented symphony with different \u201cparts\u201d but that didn\u2019t take away from it. The orchestra was amazing as always, and the maestro Ricardo Chailly was absolutely amazing. \n\nI have been to performances conducted by M\u00e4kel\u00e4, Blomstedt and Chong, and he definitely didn\u2019t disappoint. It was hard to believe that he is 70! I have heard from a member from the orchestra that his conducting hasn\u2019t changed at all and that he is still just absolutely amazing.\n\nAll in all, another mindblowing experience from the Royal Concertgebouworkest and the beautiful Concertgebouw.\n\nEdit: I really haven\u2019t given enough credit to Mao Fujita. He was so good yesterday, his range on the piano is absolutely mesmerising, he\u2019s able to play both the softest and loudest notes!

The author titled it \"The Composer as Specialist\", but the publisher, without consulting Babbit, changed it to \"Who Cares If You Listen?\"\n\n>I am concerned with stating an attitude towards the indisputable facts of the status and condition of the composer of what we will, for the moment, designate as \"serious,\" \"advanced,\" contemporary music. This composer expends an enormous amount of time and energy -- and, usually, considerable money -- on the creation of a commodity which has little, no, or negative commodity value. He is, in essence, a \"vanity\" composer. The general public is largely unaware of and uninterested in his music. The majority of performers shun it and resent it. Consequently, the music is little performed, and then primarily at poorly attended concerts before an audience consisting in the main of fellow professionals. At best, the music would appear to be for, of, and by specialists.  \n>  \n>\\[\u2026\\]  \n>  \n>The unprecedented divergence between contemporary serious music and its listeners, on the one hand, and traditional music and its following, on the other, is not accidental and -- most probably -- not transitory. Rather, it is a result of a half-century of revolution in musical thought, a revolution whose nature and consequences can be compared only with, and in many respects are closely analogous to, those of the mid-nineteenth-century revolution in theoretical physics.  \n>  \n>\\[\u2026\\]  \n>  \n>The time has passed when the normally well-educated man without special preparation could understand the most advanced work in, for example, mathematics, philosophy, and physics. Advanced music, to the extent that it reflects the knowledge and originality of the informed composer, scarcely can be expected to appear more intelligible than these arts and sciences to the person whose musical education usually has been even less extensive than his background in other fields.  \n>  \n>\\[\u2026\\]  \n>  \n>And so, I dare suggest that the composer would do himself and his music an immediate and eventual service by total, resolute, and voluntary withdrawal from this public world to one of private performance and electronic media, with its very real possibility of complete elimination of the public and social aspects of musical composition. By so doing, the separation between the domains would be defined beyond any possibility of confusion of categories, and the composer would be free to pursue a private life of professional achievement, as opposed to a public life of unprofessional compromise and exhibitionism.  \n>  \n>But how, it may be asked, will this serve to secure the means of survival for the composer and his music? One answer is that, after all, such a private life is what the university provides the scholar and the scientist. It is only proper that the university, which -- significantly -- has provided so many contemporary composers with their professional training and general education, should provide a home for the \"complex,\" \"difficult,\" and \"problematical\" in music.  \n>  \n>\\[\u2026\\]  \n>  \n>Granting to music the position accorded other arts and sciences promises the sole substantial means of survival for the music I have been describing. Admittedly, if this music is not supported, the whistling repertory of the man in the street will be little affected, the concertgoing activity of the conspicuous consumer of musical culture will be little disturbed. But music will cease to evolve, and, in that important sense, will cease to live.","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1678326020.0},{"title":"Favorite Music\/Genre outside of classical","author":"BenLear","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/classicalmusic\/comments\/11mjazb\/favorite_musicgenre_outside_of_classical\/","text":"I was just curious what you all listen to outside of classical music.

The quiets are too quiet and the louds are too loud. I hate listening to a piece and having to constantly hound the volume control because I either can't hear anything at all or my ears are getting blasted.\n\nI work as a recording engineer, so I know how mics work, the effect of distance, polar patterns, EQing, mixing, and mastering. I also know that replicating a live performance perfectly is going to be near impossible without giving everyone their own mic. Things like a solo clarinet playing a quiet, gentle passage clearly over the entire string section (as in Schubert's 8th symphony) is going to be a herculean task to replicate using only room mics.\n\n I can't help but feel almost every recoding I hear would be vastly improved by narrowing the dynamic range, sometimes by a considerable amount. especially since timbres produced by instruments change depending on what dynamic they're playing, meaning you can still tell when an instrument plays quietly even if the decibel count difference isn't drastic.\n\nI never really hear this being brought up, though, and people seem to listen to the music just fine, which makes me wonder if I'm the issue hear.","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1678140531.0},{"title":"Variations on a Rococo Theme (Tchaikovsky) -- Juilliard Pre-College student performed with the Orchestra of Camerata NJ on 2\/26\/23","author":"childhood000","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=w2iLxR2rkAc","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1678207523.0},{"title":"Hand written Sibelius 5 manuscript","author":"mike_tai_swan","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/classicalmusic\/comments\/11l34cz\/hand_written_sibelius_5_manuscript\/","text":"I feel like this is a long shot but I\u2019ve been searching forever for a hand written manuscript of Sibelius Symphony 5.

I have found a seemingly endless well of great composers, styles, and recordings of these pieces from very talented performers and ensembles. It's music that I'll probably be listening to for the rest of my life and still not have heard it all.\n\nBut something I have had a hard time with, is figuring out a good reference guide that really breaks down the categories of baroque music into a tangible list of 'styles' and their corresponding genres. The best I can think of for this is to break it down between different instruments, and regional styles for said instruments, in which there are a cluster of composers for said style with said instrument. But then again, each of those composers bring something new to the table that arguably is a new style in of itself. That being said, here are some 'clusters' of baroque music that I find notable (please note I am focusing on instrumental, not vocal or sacred works)\n\n'Style Phantasticus'; improvisational and contrapuntal keyboard music, typically for organ or harpsichord. Close ties to Lutheran vocal melodies-\nThis tradition began with the likes of Claudio Merulo, Girolama Frescobaldi, and JP Sweelinck. Evolved to composers such as Johann Pachelbel, Dietrich Buxtehude, and eventually JS Bach.\n\n'Concerto Grosso'; light and melodic, expressionate Italian style, often in the form of sonatas and concertos. Instruments like violins, cellos, woodwinds, and sometimes even organs. Evolved from the instrumental side of Monteverdi's style at the beginning baroque era. Got perfected by Corelli and advanced by the likes of Vivaldi, Handel, and Tartini.\n\n'Stile Brise'; a style derived from lute music where melodies are hidden subtly within arpeggiated chords. Started in French lute music with composers such as Robert De Visee and the Gaultiers. The style also got brought to the harpsichord through composers like Rameau and Couperin. A German sound was added to this style through the composer Silvius Leopold Weiss.\n\n'Suites and overture'; orchestral openings to French operas and sets of tunes to dance to. Use of instruments unique to the french baroque such as the viola and horn among others.\n\n'Rococco'; composers whose music was beginning to go into the classical era yet retained some baroque features. CPE Bach and Dominico Scarlatti are good instances of this.\n\n'All of the above'; composers that experimented in all genres,  and added their own personal flair. Bach and Telemann are good examples of this.\n\n\nThis is just my rough guide so far to this expansive period of music history. I'd love to hear alternative ways of looking at this however, or feedback to improve my understanding of the types of baroque music. I understand that because of the massive creativity of many of these composers some of them truly do stand in a category of their own which can make it hard to really categorize some of this music. But it does help explore a genre when you can navigate the different strains of music. I hope you enjoyed and feel free to comment your take on this.","upvote_ratio":0.83,"created_utc":1678139218.0},{"title":"Picking up cello at 29?","author":"Herecomestreble_93","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/classicalmusic\/comments\/11kc9k0\/picking_up_cello_at_29\/","text":"Hi all, I\u2019m considering starting cello lessons.

My father, who is from the North (Hanoi, he is currently 73 now), also loves classical music, having studied in the USSR between 1969 and 1975 and having been trained as a medical doctor in both East Germany and Czechoslovakia for one year each before returning to Vietnam. Several relatives in my father's side also love classical music, with classical music being a favourite genre to some. My mother's side however (from the South) isn't really interested in classical music at all.\n\nI am curious if western classical music is popular in Vietnam, given its recent popularity in countries like China, Japan, and South Korea, or is it not, and if it is, then where is classical music usually popular and respected in Vietnam?

I tried asking it to pretend to be Lester Bangs and be snarky, but it refused!)\n\nPrompt: \"Review Dvorak's Legends in comparison to the best pieces of music ever made, and show its deficiencies and how it might be improved.\"\n\n> Comparing Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's \"Legends\" to the best pieces of music ever made is a tall order, but I'll do my best to provide an objective review of the work and identify any potential areas of improvement.\n\n> First and foremost, it must be acknowledged that Dvo\u0159\u00e1k was a masterful composer with an exceptional gift for melody, rhythm, and orchestration. The \"Legends\" suite showcases many of his strengths, with each piece offering a unique and evocative mood or character that captures the listener's attention.\n\n> However, when compared to some of the greatest works of classical music ever composed, such as Beethoven's Ninth Symphony or Bach's Mass in B Minor, \"Legends\" may fall short in terms of its complexity and emotional depth. While each piece is well-crafted and enjoyable to listen to, there is a certain lack of profundity or lasting impact that might prevent it from being considered one of the absolute best pieces of music ever made.\n\n> One potential area of improvement for \"Legends\" might be to incorporate more experimentation or innovation, whether it be through the use of unconventional instrumentation or the incorporation of more complex harmonic or rhythmic structures. While Dvo\u0159\u00e1k was certainly a skilled and inventive composer, there is a sense that \"Legends\" is somewhat conservative in its approach, with few surprises or unexpected turns.\n\n> Overall, while \"Legends\" may not be one of the absolute best pieces of music ever made, it is certainly a worthy addition to the canon of classical music, and a testament to Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's talents as a composer. With a bit more experimentation and risk-taking, it could potentially reach even greater heights and become a classic for the ages.","upvote_ratio":0.87,"created_utc":1677857935.0},{"title":"Richard Wagner - Prelude And Love-Death From Tristan and Isolde","author":"Dramatic_Turn5133","url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/U1p8h5HLbUs","text":"","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1677867496.0},{"title":"Erik Satie: Gymnop\u00e9die No. 2","author":"nomariii","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=biWJFkj0wUw","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.6,"created_utc":1677884121.0},{"title":"Most Dramatic Vivaldi String Compositions","author":"Complete-Ad5058","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/classicalmusic\/comments\/11h53mo\/most_dramatic_vivaldi_string_compositions\/","text":"What are your favroute most frantic and dramatic string compositions (\/concertos) of Vivaldi?","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1677861205.0},{"title":"Happy 199 Birthday to Bed\u0159ich Smetana","author":"ComradMarko","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/s99li6iuddla1.jpg","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1677764027.0},{"title":"Mozart K.447 Horn Concerto #3 in E-flat 2nd mov.

A little stressful.\n\nAllegri- Miserere Mei, Mozart - Requiem in D: Overtly spiritual. I have to be in the mood for these especially though.\n\nIn general I believe I tend more towards piano pieces. The big symphonies with lots of dramatic strings, etc usually comes off for me as noisy. It\u2019s almost like I\u2019m overwhelmed so I tune out and it becomes boring. A lot of Berlioz is in this category as an example but also in general tons of classical music, maybe even most.","upvote_ratio":0.63,"created_utc":1677587472.0},{"title":"Post-Baroque fugues","author":"ferenczeit","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/classicalmusic\/comments\/11dypgc\/postbaroque_fugues\/","text":"For context, my favorite fugues are the Grosse Fuge, the fugue from the Beethoven sonatas no. 28, 29 and 31 (especially the one from the Hammerklavier, I am obsessed with that one), then from the more modern ones I love the fugue from Szymanowski\u2019s piano sonata and the fugues from Hindemith\u2019s Ludus Tonalis.

Let's say, I'm familiar with classical.\n\nAs enchanting as the piano was to me, it was an acoustic guitar (when I was 20) that guided my musical future. Now, I was concerned about sounding too similar, so I determined not learn how to play other artists' songs. \n\nI learned to play two chords smoothly, and wrote a song. Then I learned another chord, and wrote another song. After three years, I chose to learn Knocking on Heaven's Door. (I have a version of that on soundcloud.)\n\nSo where am I going with this, right? Well, many songs, and many years later, I'm watching a movie called Call Me By Your Name, and was enamored by all the classical literature, art and music in the film. A couple months later I owned my first full-sized midi piano. \n\nIt's a Casio CDP-S100, and I love it. It feels and sounds very real to me. (Also, I am not affiliated with Casio. lol)\n\nAs with guitar, I didn't want to learn to play other artists' music. So I tinkered on this piano, playing exercises I'd create. Separating the hands was the biggest hurdle, for sure. I also determined to focus on one scale, only: Cm. I wanted a decent mix of white and black keys, to challenge my form.\n\nOver a span of 18 months, I had about 20 actual hours of practicing. That was when my hands started to play independently.

While he was furthering his studies with Vivaldi in Venice over 1716-17, Pisendel one day submitted to his teacher a trial run for a concerto movement which, as an indication of allegiance, starts like the caprice of the Sonata RV26 which the maestro had just given him (was it a coincidence if Bach was to open his famous double concerto in the same manner?). Vivaldi read the composition and corrected it.   \n\nPisendel kept hold of the manuscript carefully and took it back with him to Dresden (where it is still conserved in the famous Schrank II collection held in the Saxon State and University Library under the classification 2421-O14). This  extraordinary document is a godsend for anyone trying to grasp the art of the prete rosso. He was never a great one to make many corrections\u2026 He barely touched the violin part, lightly revising the writing out of the ritornelli, in particular the viola part which he livened up and cast into a slightly higher tessitura; then he crossed out, scratched off and wrote a little here, a little there, considerably lightening the accompaniments for the solos. In three strokes of his quill, or rather of his scraper, he lightened the concerto in a spectacular manner, and brought unanticipated undercurrents to the surface. The lesson is a clear one: only use what you need. Yet you still need to know what you want.","upvote_ratio":0.78,"created_utc":1677282634.0},{"title":"Pieczonka","author":"luiskolodin","url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/miZ5LrFqxl0","text":"","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1677298804.0},{"title":"Composition inspired by Morton Feldman","author":"Matekon","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/classicalmusic\/comments\/11b4kq5\/composition_inspired_by_morton_feldman\/","text":"Here's my composition \"2 a.m. Rendez-Vous\" inspired by the late years of Morton Feldman.

I have practiced so much this year and still feel so disappointed. I was rejected from prescreening by 5 schools all on the same day back in December, and it really discouraged me. I thought i was not going to be able to go into music, and\u2014 out of stress\u2014 I applied to academic universities and colleges to keep my options open, just in case i didn\u2019t pass the other 6. Now, having auditioned at 5 schools and 1 last audition tomorrow (all at really great music schools) I feel incredibly behind and inadequate. Everyone I meet at these auditions is so talented, and I feel like there is no way I can compare to anyone. I also recently just got waitlisted for two summer programs, so it just feels like I am not good enough for anything. I was thinking about it today, and I really have only been accepted to one summer festival, which was not that competitive. I am always just being slammed with rejection all the time. In the past 18 months, I\u2019ve been rejected from colleges\/programs 17 times, and I haven\u2019t even received results for any of my final auditions. My teacher and those who hear me are so encouraging, and I was pushed by these people to apply for all these competitive things. But i almost feel betrayed, they tell me I am definitely going to get in somewhere, and then I don\u2019t get in. I feel like I have nothing to show for my work. And I feel completely overwhelmed by stress that I will end up being rejected from everywhere. I just don\u2019t know what to do. And I know i definitely could have worked harder, or made better recordings etc\u2026 I don\u2019t know, this process has felt years long, and I just don\u2019t want to have to open disappointing decisions from colleges all spring. Anyways, I\u2019m sure other people struggle with this. The fear of failure is kind of a defining characteristic of any musician.","upvote_ratio":0.78,"created_utc":1677270645.0},{"title":"Platinum tier piano pieces","author":"kayonashisan","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/classicalmusic\/comments\/11ai4ci\/platinum_tier_piano_pieces\/","text":"If you can only choose 1-3 pieces to demonstrate the greatness of piano music and how rich and moving piano can sound, what would these pieces be?

My questions are these: \n\n1) Do certain instruments\/ sections get paid more than others?  For instance, do the strings get paid more than the brass?  Or is it essentially all equal, except for maybe the first chair or principal instrumentalist of your section? For instance, principal trombone or principal oboe? \n\n2) Which instruments lead each group?  Do the violins or viola's lead the strings? I have heard the flute leads the woodwinds but then I've read in some places the oboe does.....? \n\n3) Is there any type of friendly rivalry between each instrument group?  For instance, I can see the strings thinking they are better than the woodwinds and brass sections.  \n\n4) What would you say is the hardest instrument to play in each section?  Is violin harder to master than say,  the cello or bass?    Is the trumpet more technical than the trombone or French horn?   Is the oboe more difficult to play than the bassoon?  Etc? \n\n5) I have seen huge pay differences depending on what site i go to.  For NY and San Francisco, i have seen pay ranges from 150K-200K all the way to 500K for the orchestra.   Others I see more in the 80-90K range for other cities?  What is the average? \n\nThanks for any informative info!  : )","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1677189430.0},{"title":"The World's Most Underrated Musical Instrument: The Kora of West Africa","author":"Friendly_Client16","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=H6YqXAndgYQ","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1677161295.0},{"title":"Is there a second version of the \"Don Giovanni\" overture?...","author":"Angelyxer","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/classicalmusic\/comments\/11a6nm5\/is_there_a_second_version_of_the_don_giovanni\/","text":"Okay, I think all of us in this community know what the opera \"Don Giovanni\" is: A man who lovingly lies to various women accompanied by Leporello, his servant and compa buddy.

However, a couple of months ago I found a video of this overture, only with one significant difference: the ending of it was completely different!

Here's the video:\n\n\n\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/jyjVCbTo5F0\n\n\n\nWhy is this happening? Is there any explanation? Or is it simply a modified version to be performed in a concert version, without a scene?\n\nIt's him For me it is what makes the most sense. However, I MUST CLARIFY: The first chords of Don Giovanni (and the theme in adagio, the first part of the overture) is the same thing that happens before \"Don Giovanni, a cena teco m'invitasti\". In other words, we are talking about the first time that an overture presents relevant themes from an opera from the classicist period (correct me if I'm wrong, it's the only one in this repertoire that sounds like it to me and so many claim). \n\nFor whom I asked, the second version is directed by Hans Vonk, Accompanied by the Dresden Staatskapelle.\n\nI'm just a teenage boy who is crazy about classical music, opera of all repertoires. \n\nTell me about your own theories about this difference in these two versions of the overture.

Before I give the link to the playlist and start asking for recommendations, I should explain what each word means here, going from easiest to hardest.\n\n**Choral:** For this playlist, I am not just looking for music for choir but music for vocalists in the classical tradition, or a synthesized imitation of such vocals. This is why pieces with vocal soloists and Dancing Mad are on this playlist. However, I will not include pieces that take the human voice and alter it in a way that cannot be described with traditional notation, which is why tape pieces like \"It's Gonna Rain\" and \"Bye Bye Butterfly\" aren't on this list.\n\n**Masterpiece:** This is obviously very subjective, but here I mean pieces that have substance. Song cycles rather than single songs, and symphonies rather than 5-minute pieces. This is why most dark film and videogame cues aren't included but the monumental Dancing Mad is. This is still pretty subjective, and we may disagree on what makes a piece substantial.\n\n**Dark:** By this, I mean \"expressing a highly pessimistic worldview in an artistic way.\" Even though some of the pieces here may have consoling endings, there is still an extremely dark undercurrent. The \"in an artistic way\" is my method of (very subjectively) removing pieces that are dissonant for the sake of being dissonant rather than as a means of expressing the darkness and beauty of the world. Like everything, this is extremely subjective, and there are pieces of which I am unsure of their pessimism (these can be found in the playlist description).\n\nHere is the playlist: [https:\/\/youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLtie-LgFkXMvU8JT-wq9h5CKgdyUfPLwL](https:\/\/youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLtie-LgFkXMvU8JT-wq9h5CKgdyUfPLwL)\n\nLet me know what you think, and what you think can be added!\n\nEdit: Thanks for the recommendations!

My classical background is... pretty lacking. A lot of my examples, many would say aren't even classical. I'm aware, trust me! But things like these. Get ready for the \"basic bitch\" of requests.\n\n1. Clair de Lune, and others by Debussy. I LOVE Passepied, R\u00eaverie, Hommage A Rameau, and pieces like that. That's by far my favorite composer. It perfectly suits what I'm hoping to find. It's not a genre thing, but a sentimental kind of \"feeling\" I guess. *If you know any Ravel in that vein, I'd be willing to hear it. \"Jeux d\u2019eau\" is great, but Ravel isn't fully what I'm looking for. It's kind of like when you want a recommendation for Bob Dylan and someone tells you to listen to Bruce Springsteen, or a random guy with an acoustic guitar. Not quite the same. But I'd be willing to hear more.*\n\n2. Edward MacDowell - To A Wild Rose. Another great sentimental piano piece. Love it.\n\n3. Franz Liszt - Liebestr\u00e4ume. This one isn't quite as spectacular to me, but I do love it.\n\n4. Moonlight Sonata. I know it's basic, but the minimal aspect of it really hits me. I don't love really \"busy\" piano work, I think. That might be why classical is hard for me to find an entry into.\n\n5. And lastly, an odd one: [Fisherman's Horizon](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=UI3itDnSDn8). A song from a video game. One of my absolute favorite pieces. A lot of it is just a nice melody, but there's just some points when the left hand is going against the right and it sounds perfect to me. It's kind of like that one bass note in \"In My Life\" by The Beatles. In many songs it wouldn't work, but it works there. This song here got me into music when I was a young kid. I would have never picked up guitar and started bands. Now that I'm going back into learning with piano a bit more, I'd like to point out my start for this sort of music! Anything like this is just automatic endearment\n\nIf anything comes to mind, I am more than happy to check it out. Sort of minimal yet emotive piano pieces. There's been hundreds of years of people making it. There's bound to be a ton I just don't know about! If you have any advice, I'm all ears.

He lived only thirty-two years, yet in this short time\u2013or, more accurately in eighteen years \u2013 he wrote more than eleven hundred compositions. This fact, in itself sufficiently astounding becomes more so when we consider the conditions of his life as described by his biographers \u2013 his poverty and privations, from his early years, when we find him suffering from hunger and cold, and unable to buy music-paper to write down his inspirations, to his last year, when typhoid fever ended his career and left his heirs about ten dollars, not enought to pay for his funeral expenses \u2013 and no wonder, since, even in his last years, twenty cents was considered pay enough for some of those songs on which many publishers have since grown rich.\n\nSurprise has often been expressed that the Viennese (among whom he lived) and the publishers should not have appreciated him more substantially; yet it is not difficult to find reasons for this in the circumstances of the case. While a pianist or singer may find immediate recognition, a composer, especially if he has so original a message to deliver as Schubert, has to bide his time. We must bear in mind how very young he was when he died. Dr. Hanslick has urged, in defense of the Viennese, that only seven years elapsed between the publication of Schubert's first works and his death, and that during his lifetime he became known chiefly as a song composer; and songs were at that time not sung at public concerts, but only in the domestic circle. Moreover, Rossini on the one hand, and Beethoven on the other, overshadowed the modest young Schubert, and it is significant that Beethoven himself did not discover his genius till the year of his own death. As regards Schubert's orchestral works, we must remember that orchestras were not at that time what they are today. The best Viennese organization, the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde, found the symphony in C [major] \"too long and too difficult\" at the rehearsal, and substituted an earlier work. This was in 1828, the year of the composer's death. Ten years later the zealous Schumann discovered the great symphony in C and took it to Leipsic, where the equally enthusiastic Mendelssohn secured for it a noteworthy success. In Vienna, too, it was taken up again in the following year, but only two movements were given, and these were separated by a Donizetti aria! Three years later Habeneck attempted to produce this symphony in Paris, but the band rebelled over the first movement, and the same result followed in London, two years later still, when Mendelssohn put it in rehearsal for a Philharmonic concert. These things seem strange to us, but they are historic facts, and help to explain why Schubert, with all his melody and spontaneity, made his way so slowly to popular appreciation. He was young, modest, and unknown, and musicians did not hesitate to slight a symphony which they would have felt bound to study, had it borne the name of Beethoven or Mozart.\n\nBut his fame has grown steadily from year to year, and will grow greater still in the next century. Rubenstein has, perhaps, gone farther than any one, not only in including Schubert in the list of those he considers the five greatest composers \u2013 Bach, Beethoven, Schubert, Chopin, Glinka \u2013 but in exclaiming, **\u201cOnce more, a thousand times more, Bach, Beethoven and Schubert are the highest summits in music\u201d** (Die Musik und Ihre Meister, p. 50). I am asked whether I approve of this classification. Such questions are very difficult to answer. I should follow Rubenstein in including Schubert on the list of the very greatest composers, but I should not follow him in omitting Mozart. Schubert and Mozart have much in common; in both we find the same delicate sense of instrumental coloring, the same spontaneous and irrepressible flow of melody, the same instinctive command of the means of expression, and the same versatility in all the branches of their art. In their amazing fertility, too, they were alike; and herein lay, and still lies, one of the greatest impediments to their popular appreciation. The longer I live, the more I become convinced that composers, like authors, mostly follow the impulse of writing too much. There are a few exceptions, like Berlioz and Chopin \u2013 not to forget Wagner, who condensed all his genius into ten great music-dramas. Would it not have been better for their immortality and the perpetual delight of mankind, had Rossini written ten operas instead of forty, Donizetti seven instead of seventy? Even Bach\u2019s magnificent cantatas would have had a better chance of appreciation if there were not quite so many (the first 34 volumes of Bach\u2019s collected works contain 160 of them). At the same time we should be sorry to lose a single one of them.\n\nIf we are often amazed at the prevailing ignorance and neglect of many of the great works of the master, we are at the same time obliged to confess that they themselves are largely to blame; they have given us too much. There is in creative minds an impulse to write, which it is difficult to curb, and this was especially the case with Schubert, whose genius was like a spring which nothing but exhaustion could stop from flowing. Fortunately the works of the great masters have at least been made accessible in complete editions; the Schubert collection is just being completed by Breitkopf and H\u00e4rtel. It contains many gems unknown to the public, or even to the profession; and it now behoves artists and conductors to select from this embarrassing wealth what most deserves revival. **Schubert contributed to every form of his art; he was, as I have said, as versatile as Mozart, to whom he bears so many points of resemblance**. But in one respect these two masters differ widely. Mozart was greatest in the opera, where Schubert was weakest. Schubert's attempts to exercise his genius and improve his fortunes by writing operas came at an unpropitious moment--a time when Vienna was so Rossini-mad that even Beethoven was discouraged from writing for the stage. It took several rebuffs to discourage Schubert; indeed, though all his attempts failed, he is said to have had further operatic projects at the time of his last illness. He was always unlucky with his librettos, which are, without exception, inadequate. There were other untoward circumstances; yet the chief cause of his failure lay, after all, in the nature of his genius, which was lyrical, and not dramatic, or, at any rate, not theatrical.\n\nWhen Liszt produced \"Alfonso und Estrella\" at Weimar in 1854, it had only a success d'estime, and Liszt himself confessed that its performance must be regarded merely as ein Act der Pietat [an act of piety] and an execution of historic justice. He called attention to the strange fact that Schubert, who in his songs contributed such picturesque and expressive accompaniments, should in this opera have assigned to the instruments such a subordinate role that it seemed little more than a pianoforte accompaniment arranged for the orchestra. At the same time, as Liszt very properly adds, Schubert influenced the progress of opera indirectly, by showing in his songs how closely poetry can be wedded to music, and that it can be emotionally intensified by its impassioned accents. Nor must we overlook the fact that there are in these Schubert operas not a few melodies, beautiful as such, which we can enjoy at home or in the concert hall. These melodies were too lyrical in style to save the operas; they lacked also the ornamental brilliancy and theatrical dash which enabled Rossini to succeed temporarily with poor librettos, and with a less genuine dramatic instinct than Schubert has shown in some of his songs, such as the \"Erl King\" and especially the \"Doppelganger,\" where we come across chords and modulations that affect us like the weird harmonies of Ortrud's scenes in \"Lohengrin.\"\n\nBesides the opera there is only one department of music in which Schubert has not in some of his efforts reached the highest summit of musical achievement. His sacred compositions, although very beautiful from a purely musical point of view, usually lack the true ecclesiastical atmosphere \u2013 a remark which may be applied, in a general way, to Haydn and Mozart, too. To my mind, the three composers who have been most successful in revealing the inmost spirit of religious music are Palestrina, in whom Roman Catholic music reaches its climax; Bach, who embodies the Protestant spirit; and Wagner, who has struck the true ecclesiastical chord in the Pilgrims\u2019 Chorus of Tannh\u00e4user, and especially in the first and third acts of Parsifal. Compared with these three masters, other composers appear to have made too many concessions to worldly and purely musical factors \u2013 of course, not without exceptions. One of these exceptions is Mozart\u2019s Requiem, especially the \u2018Dies Irae\u2019, which moves us as few compositions do, and attunes the soul to reverence and worship. Such exceptions may also be found among Schubert\u2019s sacred compositions. Miriam\u2019s Song of Victory is a wonderful work, as are some of his masses. In the Psalms, too, he has achieved great things, especially the one for female voices in A flat major, which is celestial without worldly admixtures. It must not be forgotten, too, that the notions as to what is truly sacred in music may differ somewhat among nations and individuals, like the sense of humor. To the Viennese of their time the masses of Haydn, Mozart and Schubert probably did not seem too gem\u00fcthlich, as the Germans say \u2013 too genial and sentimental. As for Schubert himself, although he was one of the most modest of men, he was thoroughly convinced of the truly devotional character of his church music. We know this from a letter he wrote to his parents in 1825, and in which occurs the following passage:\n\n\u2018Surprise was also expressed at my piety, to which I have given expression in a hymn to the Holy Virgin, and which, as it seems, moves everyone to devotion. I believe this comes of the circumstance that I never force myself into a devout attitude, and never compose such hymns or prayers unless I am involuntarily overcome by it; but in that case it usually happens to be the genuine spirit of devotion.\u2019\n\n**Schubert's chamber music, especially his string quartets and his trios for pianoforte, violin, and violoncello, must be ranked among the very best of their kind in all musical literature**. Of the quartets, the one in D minor is, in my opinion, the most original and important, the one in A minor the most fascinating. Schubert does not try to give his chamber music an orchestral character, yet he attains a marvelous variety of beautiful tonal effects. Here, as elsewhere, his flow of melody is spontaneous, incessant, and irrepressible, leading often to excessive diffuseness.--Like Chopin and Rossini, Schubert has frequently shown how a melody may be created which can wonderfully charm us even apart from the harmonic accompaniment which naturally goes with and enriches it. But he was accused by his contemporaries of neglecting polyphony, or the art of interweaving several melodious parts [voices] into a contrapuntal web. This charge, combined with a late study of Handel's scores, induced him shortly before his death to plan a course in counterpoint with Sechter. No doubt his education in counterpoint had been neglected. It is not likely, however, that such study would have materially altered his style. That was too individual from the beginning to undergo much change, for Schubert did not outgrow his early style so noticeably as did Beethoven and Wagner, for example. Besides, Schubert had no real need of contrapuntal study. In his chamber music, as in his symphonies, we often find beautiful specimens of polyphonic writing, --see, for instance, the andantes of the C-major quintet and of the D-minor quartet, --and though his polyphony be different from Bach's or Beethoven's, it is none-the-less admirable. Mendelssohn is undoubtedly a greater master of polyphony than Schubert, yet **I prefer Schubert's chamber music to Mendelssohn's.**\n\n**Of Schubert\u2019s symphonies, too, I am such an enthusiastic admirer that I do not hesitate to place him next to Beethoven, far above Mendelssohn, as well as above Schumann.** Mendelssohn had some of Mozart\u2019s natural instinct for orchestration and gift for form, but much of his work has proved ephemeral. Schumann is at his best in his songs, his chamber music and his pianoforte pieces. His symphonies, too, are great works, yet they are not always truly orchestral; the form seems to hamper the composer, and the instrumentation is not always satisfactory. This is never the case with Schubert. Although he sometimes wrote carelessly, and often diffusely, he is never at fault in his means of expression, while mastery of form came to him spontaneously. **In originality of harmony and modulation, and in his gift of orchestral colouring, Schubert has had no superior**. Dr. Riemann asserts with justice that, in their use of harmony, both Schumann and Liszt are descendants of Schubert; Brahms, too, whose enthusiasm for Schubert is well known, has perhaps felt his influence; and as for myself, I cordially acknowledge my great obligations to him.\n\nI have just observed that mastery of form came to Schubert spontaneously. This is illustrated by his early symphonies, five of which he wrote before he was twenty, at which, the more I study them, the more I marvel. Although the influence of Haydn and Mozart is apparent in them, Schubert's musical individuality is unmistakable in the character of the melody, in the harmonic progressions, and in many exquisite bits of orchestration. In his later symphonies he becomes more and more individual and original. The influence of Haydn and Mozart, so obvious in his earlier efforts, is gradually eliminated, and with his contemporary, Beethoven, he had less in common from the beginning. He resembles Beethoven, however, in the vigour and melodious flow of his basses; such basses we find already in his early symphonies.** His Unfinished Symphony and the great one in C are unique contributions to musical literature, absolutely new and original, Schubert in every bar. **What is perhaps most characteristic about them is the song-like melody pervading them. **He introduced the song into the symphony, and made the transfer so skillfully that Schumann was led to speak of the resemblance to the human voice** (Aehnlichkeit mit dem Stimmorgan) in these orchestral parts.\n\nAlthough these two symphonies are by far the best of Schubert\u2019s, it is a pity that they alone should be deemed worthy [of] a place in our concert programmes. I played the sixth in C major and No. 5 in B [flat] major a dozen times with my orchestral pupils at the National Conservatory last winter; they shared my pleasure in them, and recognized at once their great beauty.\n\nIt was with great pleasure and feelings of gratitude that I read not long ago of the performance in Berlin of the B [flat] major Symphony by Herr Weingartner, one of the few conductors who have had the courage to put this youthful work on their programs. Schubert's fourth, too, is an admirable composition. It bears the title of \"Tragic Symphony,\" and was written at the age of nineteen, about a year after the \"Erl King.\" It makes one marvel that one so young should have had the power to give utterance to such deep pathos. In the adagio there are chords that strikingly suggest the anguish of Tristan's utterances; nor is this the only place wherein Schubert is prophetic of Wagnerian harmonies. And although partly anticipated by Gluck and Mozart, he was one of the first to make use of an effect to which Wagner and other modern composers owe many of their most beautiful orchestral colors--the employment of the brass, not for noise, but played softly, to secure rich and warm tints.\n\nThe richness and variety of colouring in the great Symphony in C are astounding. It is a work which always fascinates, always remains new. It has the effect of gathering clouds, with constant glimpses of sunshine breaking through them. It illustrates also, like most of Schubert\u2019s compositions, the truth of an assertion once made to me by Dr. Hans Richter \u2013 that the greatest masters always reveal their genius most unmistakably and most delightfully in their slow movements. Personally I prefer the Unfinished Symphony even to the one in C; apart from its intrinsic beauty, it avoids the fault of diffuseness. If Schubert\u2019s symphonies have a serious fault it is prolixity; he does not know when to stop; yet, if the repeats are omitted, a course of which I thoroughly approve, and which, indeed, is now generally adopted, they are not too long.\n\nSchubert\u2019s case, in fact, is not an exception to, but an illustration of, the general rule that symphonies are made too long. When Bruckner\u2019s eighth Symphony was produced in Vienna last winter, the Philharmonic Society had to devote a whole concert to it. The experiment has not been repeated anywhere, and there can be no doubt that this symphony would have a better chance of making its way into the world if it were shorter. This remark has general application. We should return to the symphonic dimensions approved by Haydn and Mozart. In this respect Schumann is a model, especially in his B flat major and D minor Symphonies; also in his chamber music. Modern taste calls for music that is concise, condensed and pithy. In Germany, England, and America, Schubert's instrumental works, chamber and orchestral, have long since enjoyed a vogue and popularity which have amply atoned for their neglect at first. As for the French, they have produced two Schubert biographies, but it cannot be said that they have shown the same general sympathy for this master as for some other German composers, or as the English have, thanks largely to the enthusiastic efforts of my esteemed friend, Sir George Grove. It is on record that after Habeneck had made an unsuccessful effort (his musicians rebelled at the rehearsal) to produce the great symphony in C [major] at a Conservatoire concert, no further attempt was made with Schubert's orchestral compositions at these concerts for forty years. This may help to explain the extraordinary opinion of the eminent French critic, Fetis, that Schubert is less original in his instrumental works than in his songs, the popularity of which, too, he declared to be largely a matter of fashion! The latter insinuation is, of course, too absurd to call for comment today, but as regards the first part of his criticism I do not hesitate to say that greatly as I esteem Schubert\u2019s songs, I value his instrumental works even more highly. Were all his compositions to be destroyed but two, I should say, save the last two symphonies.\n\nFortunately we are not confronted by any such necessity. The loss of Schubert's piano-forte pieces and songs would indeed be irreparable. For although much of their spirit and substance has passed into the works of his imitators and legitimate followers, the originals have never been equalled in their way. **In most of his works Schubert is unique in melody, rhythm, modulation, and orchestration, but from a formal point of view he is most original in his songs and his short pieces for piano.** In his symphonies, chamber music, operas and sacred compositions, he follows classical models; but in the Lied [song], the \"Musical Moment,\" the \"Impromptu,\" he is romanticist in every fiber. Yet he wrote no fewer than twenty-four sonatas for pianoforte, two or four hands, in which he follows classical models, and we can trace the influence of Beethoven's style even in the three which he wrote in the last year of his life. This seems strange at first when we consider that in the Lied and the short pianoforte pieces he betrayed no such influence even in his earliest days. The \"Erl King\" and \"The Wanderer,\" written when he was eighteen and nineteen respectively, are Schubert in every bar, whereas the piano sonatas and symphonies of this period are much more imitative, less individual. One reason for this, doubtless, is that just as it is easier to write a short lyric poem than a long epic, so it is easier for a young composer to be original in short forms than in the more elaborate sonata and symphony; and we must remember that Schubert died at thirty-one.\n\nBut there was another reason. **The tendency of the romantic school has been towards short forms, and although Weber helped to show the way, to Schubert belongs the chief credit of originating the short models of piano-forte pieces which the romantic school has preferably cultivated.** His Musical Moments are unique, and it may be said that in the third Impromptu (op. 90) lie the germs of the whole of Mendelssohn's Songs without Words. Schumann has remarked that Schubert\u2019s style is more idiomatically pianistic (clavierm\u00e4ssig) than Beethoven\u2019s and this is perhaps true of these short pieces. Yet it can hardly be said that either Schubert or Schumann was in this respect equal to Bach or Chopin, who of all composers have written the most idiomatically for the piano. I cannot agree with Schumann in his rather depreciatory notice of Schubert's last sonatas (he speaks of \"greater simplicity of invention,\" \"a voluntary dispensing with brilliant novelty,\" and connects this with Schubert's last illness). I would not say that Schubert is at his best in these sonatas as a whole, but I have a great admiration for parts of them, especially for the last one in B-flat [major] with the exquisite andante in C-sharp minor. Taking them all in all, I do not know but that I prefer his sonatas even to his short pieces for the piano. Yet they are never played at concerts! Just as the \"Impromptus\" and \"Musical Moments\" were the source of the large crop of romantic short pieces, so Schubert's charming waltzes were the predecessors of the Lanner and Strauss dances on the one hand, and of Chopin's waltzes on the other. There is an astounding number of these Schubert dance pieces; they are charming as originally written, and Liszt has given some of them a brilliant setting for the concert hall. In this humble sphere, as in the more exalted ones we have discussed, historians have hardly given Schubert full credit for his originality and influence.\n\nIn Schubert\u2019s pianoforte music, perhaps even more than in his other compositions, we find a Slavic trait which he was the first to introduce prominently into art-music, namely the quaint alternation of major and minor within the same period. Nor is this the only Slavic or Hungarian trait to be found in his music. During his residence in Hungary, he assimilated national melodies and rhythmic peculiarities, and embodied them in his art, thus becoming the forerunner of Liszt, Brahms and others who have made Hungarian melodies an integral part of European concert music. From the rich stores of Slavic folk music, in its Hungarian, Russian, Bohemian and Polish varieties, the composers of today have derived, and will continue to derive, much that is charming and novel in their music. Nor is there anything objectionable in this, for if the poet and the painter base much of their best art on national legends, songs and traditions, why should not the musician? And to Schubert will belong the honor of having been one of the first to show the way.\n\nPerhaps the luckiest accident in Schubert\u2019s life was his acquaintance and friendship with the famous tenor Vogl. This was brought about deliberately by his friends, in order to secure for his songs the advantage of that singer's artistic interpretations. Vogl at first pretended to be \"tired of music,\" and showed some indifference to his modest young accompanist's songs; but this was soon changed to interest, followed by genuine enthusiasm. Thus it came about that these songs were gradually made familiar in Viennese social circles. Schubert himself sang, though only with a \"composer's voice\"; but he must have been an admirable accompanist. In a letter to his parents he says: \"I am assured by some that under my fingers the keys are changed to singing voices, which, if true, would please me greatly.\" This, written only three years before his death, illustrates his great modesty. In some recently published reminiscences by Josef von Spaun, it is related how, when Vogl and Schubert performed together at soirees in Vienna, the ladies would crowd about the tenor, lionizing him and entirely ignoring the composer. But Schubert, instead of feeling annoyed or jealous, was actually pleased. Adoration embarrassed him, and he is known to have dodged it once by escaping secretly by the back door.\n\nLittle did the Viennese dream that the songs thus interpreted for them by Schubert and Vogl would create a new era in music. **In the Lied or lyric song, not only is Schubert the first in point of time, but no one has ever surpassed him.** Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven did indeed write a few songs, but merely by the way, and without revealing much of their genius or individuality in them. **But Schubert created a new epoch with the Lied, as Bach did with the piano, and Haydn with the orchestra. All other song writers have followed in his footsteps, all are his pupils, and it is to his rich treasure of songs that we owe, as a heritage, the beautiful songs of such masters as Schumann, Franz, and Brahms.** To my taste the best songs written since Schubert are the Magelonen-Lieder of Brahms; but I agree with the remark once made to me by the critic Ehlert that Franz attained the highest perfection of all in making poetry and music equivalent in his songs.\n\nIn the best of Schubert's songs we find the same equivalence of poem and music, and it was lucky that Vogl was an artist who, as Spaun says, \"sang in a way as to interest his hearers not only in the music, but also in the poem,\" which so few singers do. In the absence of singers who could imitate Vogl in this respect, Liszt was justified in arranging these songs for the pianoforte, whereby he greatly accelerated their popularity. To hear the real Schubert, however, we must have the voice, and the poem, too, so that we may note how closely the poem and the music are amalgamated, and how admirably the melodic accent coincides with the poetic. In this respect Schubert marks great advance over his predecessors. He was almost as adverse to word repetitions as Wagner, whom he also resembles in the powerful emotional effects he produces by his modulations, especially in his later songs. Schubert's melodic fount flowed so freely that he sometimes squandered good music on a poor text, as is shown in his operas and in some of his songs. Usually, however, the best poems evoked the best music from his creative fancy. His fertility is amazing. It is known that he composed as many as eight songs in one day, and ninety-nine in one year (1816), while the whole number of his songs exceeds six hundred. The best of these songs are now so universally known, and have been so much discussed that it is difficult to offer any new comment on them. There is only one more point to which attention may be called here-- Schubert's power of surrounding us with the poetic atmosphere of his subject with the very first bars of his Lieder [songs]. For such a stroke of genius recall his song \"Der Leiermann,\" the pathetic story of the poor hurdy-gurdy player whose plate is always empty, and for whose woes Schubert wins our sympathy by his sad music--by that plaintive, monotonous figure which pervades the accompaniment from beginning to end, bringing the whole scene vividly before our eyes and keeping it there to the end. **Before Schubert no song writer had conceived such an effect; after he had shown the way others eagerly followed in his footsteps.**\n\n-END-","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1676733771.0},{"title":"Beethoven like Chopin's first concerto","author":"CadavreContent","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/classicalmusic\/comments\/115xmhn\/beethoven_like_chopins_first_concerto\/","text":"I'm in a bit of a phase where I'm really enjoying Chopin's first concerto, especially the first movement.

Brilliant ritornelli with numerous spatial effects launch ringing and rugged solos, either at an exuberantly full speed on wilful themes, or by weaving melodies over exotic harmonies. Above all in a resolutely theatrical fashion. The visual element involved \u2013 embracing sweeping bow movements, irregular articulations and abrupt shifts of position \u2013 is essential to the effect. Here is observable Vivaldi\u2019s skill in knowing how to take advantage of his instrument: no mechanical action demanded is gratuitous, it always acts as the source for a musical effect of a superior nature; this is demonstrated by the \u201cdin\u201d represented by the first solo which relies simply on open-string playing. The concerto\u2019s final cadenza exists in various versions (Vivaldi most probably used to produce his own improvisations at the time of playing, selecting from passages which he had prepared in advance, according to need). This recording uses the especially athletic one, which was dedicated to Count Leonardo Pontotti from Cividale del Friuli; it is the longest of the dozen of cadenzas which we know by Vivaldi and is an excellent representation of the genre designed to open up a new pathway: Locatelli composed his Capricci in Venice some years later, and these were to act as a model for the famous 24 Caprices of Paganini.\n\nThe name \u201cGrosso Mogul\u201d does not appear on the autograph copy of the concerto (only in a contemporaneous copy held in Schwerin). The title is believed to have been added to the concerto on the grounds of its clear success (JS Bach went as far as making a transcription of it for the organ, BWV594), probably as a reference to the famous diamond of the same name (of no less than 280 carats!), discovered in India and cut in the seventeenth century by the Venetian Hortensio Borgis. This recording presents the original version of the concerto for the first time; Vivaldi subsequently made changes to it on several occasions, in particular for one publishing project where he took good care to remove the cadenzas and the recitativo, which were too closely connected to a personal practice to be able to be suitably understood and performed in the rest of Europe. \n\nThe patrician Venetian Benedetto Marcello, a man with Arcadian inclinations and sensitivities towards French Enlightenment ideas, moreover criticized the doubtful behavior of this (anagrammatic) \u201cAldiviva\u201d (in his Il teatro alla moda, 1720) who was capable of giving a strong boost to a flagging opera merely by unshackling his violin. For as well as \u201ckeeping a tight grip on its neck\u201d and playing \u201cinterminable cadenzas\u201d, Aldiviva also gives himself up to veritable fairground effects such as improvisations on popular dances, imitations of birds or shooting stars \u201cwith plucked, or lead-muted \\[instruments\\]\u201d, in particular with a violin in tromba marina. Since all references to this are connected with Vivaldi, it would appear that this strange instrument was an invention of his. It is a violin with a modified bridge (resembling the trembling example of a trumpet marine) which produces a sound between a hunting horn and a rattle. Vivaldi assigned to the instrument his finest rustic dances and his startling slow lyrical movements; clearly this is not one of the Muses singing on Mount Parnassus here, but who better than this unlikely individual to recount these intensely tender pieces. \u201cThere are cries deceitful for the ears which are true for the heart.\u201d","upvote_ratio":0.84,"created_utc":1676590736.0},{"title":"Organ Magic: Ferry's Improvised Romantic Fantasy Performance","author":"ferrymusic","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iwGk8sxKBtQ","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.6,"created_utc":1676640048.0},{"title":"Looking for decent seats at decent price","author":"Ya75384","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/classicalmusic\/comments\/114r9jq\/looking_for_decent_seats_at_decent_price\/","text":"Where does anyone suggest buying tickets for Bocelli in May in rosemont, Il at at reasonable price?","upvote_ratio":0.25,"created_utc":1676652085.0},{"title":"Mary Lattimore - Jimmy V","author":"InsularAtlantica","url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/MlHgA85fzGM","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1676631083.0},{"title":"Looking for march pieces","author":"RunningBear276","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/classicalmusic\/comments\/114pn9b\/looking_for_march_pieces\/","text":"My band director is looking for marches for us to compare for March Madness and i\u2019m struggling to find anything decent.

Honestly, given my lack of expertise I didn't stick around that video for very long, but next to it was recommended Lim's performance of Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 3.\n\nIt was quite long for my bird-brain attention span, but I had it playing in the background while playing a game.

(I hope it doesn't fall under the self-promotion rule..)\n\nHi everyone! :) My name is Miko\u0142aj. I'm 19, soon to be 20, I come from Poland and I love music! I play the piano as my main instrument but the violin is also very close to my heart (although, I probably love it more than it loves me hahaha) My favorite composer is Fryderyk Chopin. He is my hero and I really feel like his music understands me and my world. I also love Mozart but I don't listen to him nearly as much as to Chopin's music. I'm very open to other types of music, so if any of you wanna recommend me something to listen to, it's gonna make me really happy :D\n\nI have other hobbies as well. I love art and my favorite painter is Vincent van Gogh. I like chess, although playing online chess can get a bit annoying at times haha :) I'm also interested in psychiatry and psychology, I don't really know a whole lot about these fields but I find them fascinating:)  I really like learning about different kinds of peoples and cultures, and finding out more about our incredible world. \n\nI'd love to meet you guys and hopefully become friends! I can't wait!!! :)  \n\nI'm not sure what PotW means but I set it as the flair hoping it means People of The World, if it's something vulgar then I'll change it :D","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1676312806.0},{"title":"Flaner \u00e0 Paris","author":"Gunnisch","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/classicalmusic\/comments\/111y30c\/flaner_\u00e0_paris\/","text":"Let the piano take you on a journey of relaxation and peace, while the violoncello explores a whole world of sounds and harmonics.

What I mean by this is the setting and frequency exposure to classical that we have in the modern day compared to other genres.\n\nI've always felt that places such as doctor's office waiting rooms have been especially bad for creating positive exposure. Consider that the office waiting room is usually some combination of cold, dreary, quiet, boring, and usually for the patient, anxiety inducing. Additionally, while NPR is a great station and I've discovered many great works from listening, I do find they tend to play what I feel are less high quality recordings a.k.a. tinty\/canned. And I feel like this can often lack the \"umph\" that better versions can have on us emotionally. The exposure of classical as well of as the other factors of being in a waiting room I feel has a sort of negative conditioning on people. \n\nOf course, for us classical music lovers we can enjoy it mostly anywhere and anytime. But I personal find when I enter a waiting room and I hear it NPR, I'm usually not as stoked as I would be in a different setting. \n\nI've probably missed a few points and my theory probably has a few holes in it, but I'd love to get your thoughts on all this. \n\nOn the flipside, I can contest that my own exposure to classical through the old cartoons of the 90s and 00s had a positive effect on me overall, and I would guess many of you in this group.","upvote_ratio":0.47,"created_utc":1676318343.0},{"title":"HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY!!

If so, thoughts?\n\nSheku Kanneh-Mason was absolutely wonderful playing Bloch's King Solomon! For me, his style of playing is very reminiscent of Jacqueline du Pre although he's also a fantastic collaborator. I don't think I've ever seen anyone work so well with Andris Nelsons, who is generally great with soloists, but these two together were dynamo. The interpretation was rather clean. Not as much vibrato from Kanneh-Mason as one may expect with a piece like the Bloch but the way his playing fit in with Nelson's overall concept and sound for the work...really wonderful. His encore was perfect and the hall, containing a lot of chatty students on Thursday night, was silent during it.\n\nCarlos Simon's new work Four Black American Dances commissioned by the BSO is also fantastic. However, I will say that I feel like it was a bit beyond the capabilities of the BSO and if it had gone to a symphony like LA, it would have sounded perfect. The work requires the trumpeters to go jazz with a mute to squelch and \"wah-wah\". The BSO trumpeters weren't really adept with this and need some master classes with Wynton Marsalis (who is, of course, adept with both classical and jazz trumpet). The percussionist also seemed to have some difficulty with Simon's directions, including using a plank against a wood board.

The LSO is coming to Australia with Simon Rattle and it seems pretty rare they come so I thought I'd pick up one of the last tickets they had left. They are going to be performing  **John Adams:** Harmonielehre, **Claude Debussy:** La Mer, **Maurice Ravel:** Daphnis et Chlo\u00e9 Suite No.2. As mentioned I've never been to a live Orchestra so am unsure what to expect. I am going to be going by myself. Any advice for me? Also is the seat I got a decent seat for a first timer? (My seat is about where the red dot is). It's all I could get.  I'm only 16, I have been interested in film music and classical music and would just love to see an Orchestra live. So yeah any advice for anything is appreciated.

Some Mozart operas take 3 hours. Wagner later expanded this to 4 or 5 hours. AFAIK the length of an opera is limited by the health of singers, so we won't get any operas longer than 5 hours.\n\nBeethoven's symphonies were often barely longer than half a hour. Later romantic composers like Bruckner or Mahler created 1h or sometimes even 1,5h symphonies. But it never got any longer than this. Why did no composer decide to write a 2 or even 3 or 4 hour symphony?","upvote_ratio":0.84,"created_utc":1676064114.0},{"title":"Do older classical recordings have less dynamic range and is that why everyone thinks classical music is \"relaxing?\"","author":"SnackThisWay","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/classicalmusic\/comments\/10z6qvd\/do_older_classical_recordings_have_less_dynamic\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.83,"created_utc":1676073233.0},{"title":"Sviatoslav Richter plays Tchaikovsky Grand Sonata in G","author":"Dramatic_Turn5133","url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/X2NTCBbhcgw","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1676065685.0},{"title":"Pls help take two Lang Lang tickets off my hands!!","author":"hopeufindurairpods","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/classicalmusic\/comments\/10ymt4y\/pls_help_take_two_lang_lang_tickets_off_my_hands\/","text":"My friend and I can\u2019t go anymore to Lang Lang\u2019s Grieg concert on 02\/20 in San Francisco and we\u2019re not sure where to post this. ;-;\n\nMessage me if youre interested!!","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1676021733.0},{"title":"Pieces of music associated with magic","author":"Walt_Gilman","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/classicalmusic\/comments\/10yr5qi\/pieces_of_music_associated_with_magic\/","text":"Hi, wondering if anyone can suggest pieces of music said to cast a spell or have magical effects on the listener?

In fact, it's my #1 favorite Ring Cycle recording. I know that Solti and Karajan get all the praise, and I understand that. But Janowski didn't have to be histrionic with the music: he keeps it direct with quick tempos while still making it intense. The orchestra also gives a splendid performance. Singers are very distinctive and wonderfully talented.\n\nI've been hearing his Berlin Radio recording on both Youtube and Spotify, and I'm been warming up to it for quite some time (I need to buy the CD box set ASAP). Konieczny is good as Wotan, though I still prefer Theo Adam. The other singers are pretty great, too. The Berlin recording does have better sound quality, too. But the orchestra itself is a couple of notches below Dresden.\n\nA nitpick with the Dresden recording: during the finale to Das Rheingold, the bass trumpet drowns out the rest of the brass, which is a bit of a letdown.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1676075734.0},{"title":"Ferry's Mesmerizing Improvisation of a Light and Airy Modern Organ Piece","author":"ferrymusic","url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/afbHlNIqBK4","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.55,"created_utc":1676059699.0},{"title":"Wendy Carlos wasn\u2019t interviewed for biography?","author":"phishhead94","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/classicalmusic\/comments\/10z62ot\/wendy_carlos_wasnt_interviewed_for_biography\/","text":"From what I understand Carlos was not interviewed for the biography on her written by Sewell despite Sewell trying to secure interviews.

Bruckner and Mahler are prime examples, and they really only became commonly accepted in the classical world through the later passionate advocacy of certain conductors. It strikes me that composers can be controversial in two ways. First you have the composers who, although making a name among classical music critics and aficionados, remain deeply controversial among the wider listening public. This is perhaps Second Viennese School music or post war avantgarde. I can think of the Proms performance of Harrison Birtwistle's Panic in 1995. Second, you have composers who are rejected by professional critics, musicians and aficionados, yet find some small but significant segment of classical music listeners who absolutely love their music, people like Allan Pettersson, Havergal Brian, Alan Hovhaness.\n\nWho are your favourite controversial composers? Why are they controversial? Do you think their music will make it long term as part of the classical canon? Please don't use this as an opportunity to attack composers you don't like.\n\nEdit: In an attempt to improve clarity and avoid philosophical discussions about what 'controversial' means, I define a 'controversial composer' as one who is not part of the 'canon' as yet, but currently has both ardent enthusiasts and ardent detractors. This is likely either to be a modern composer, or one who certain musicians are currently trying to resurrect from obscurity.","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1675972277.0},{"title":"What makes a Shostakovich fugue a Shostakovich fugue?","author":"Manriki_Kusari","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/classicalmusic\/comments\/10ygfsk\/what_makes_a_shostakovich_fugue_a_shostakovich\/","text":"I have an assignment that\u2019s asking me to create a fugue for 2 marimbas in the style of Shostakovich, and while I\u2019m mostly familiar with the fugue form, I don\u2019t really get what are the particular idioms unique to Shostakovich.
