I am considering doing a certificate at a mid-ranked state university in physics education for about $5,000. \n\nConsiderations:\n\n1) I have a master's in computer science\n\n2) I can afford $5,000, but would like an eventual ROI\n\n3) I won't get paid extra for teaching physics in addition to computer science, but I am certain that I would like both \n\n4) The certificate looks pretty legit and rigorous (you take actual graduate-level physics classes, not just fluffy middle school pedagogy classes)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI certainly don't want to be teaching forever. I enjoy it, but with skills like computer science and physics, I am pretty sure I could get a much higher-paying job elsewhere. \n\nWhat gave me this idea was when I was watching an episode of To Catch a Predator. One of the people caught was a HS math teacher, who was (for obvious reasons) fired from his job but ended up getting a higher-paying job as an aerospace engineer. \n\nWhile I fortunately am not a predator, and do feel a little uncomfortable by the fact that I got this idea from a registered sex offender, the fact is that these quantitative skills of mine could potentially lead to a much higher-paying job in the future.\n\nQuestion: \n\nWould you think it's worth it to get a physics certificate in addition to my master's in computer science? Could I get a job that somehow uses both skills? \n\nThank you  so much.",

Since speed is a relative measurement of the distance between 2 objects divided by what we call time, \nhow can a photon traveling in a straight line have its internal clock, as observed an outsider (“Earthling”) slow to a stop, while the Earthling’s clock, also moving towards the photon at light speed AS OBSERVED BY THE PHOTON)does not slow to a stop? \nHow can both clocks be slowed at the same rate?\nI don’t know if I’m thinking about this wrongly because I’m not a physics student, but it is perplexing…",

However that wasn't the plan and I couldn't.  \nBut given the response I want to do a Lab Work as a graded assignment in the next quarter post Christmas break.\n\n**Suggestion Needed:**  \nI need help in making a list of Experiment that a Grade 9 student can do. Maybe something they can do at home.  \nTo make this a fair graded assignment I have decided to give them a list of at least 20 different experiments on the theme of Work, Power and Energy, so each student will perform a different experiment.  \nIdeally I would like the students themselves to choose a topic for themselves but if they cannot I would like to suggest an experiment for their level focused on the theme. Either way students would select their Independent and dependent variable perform the experiment and derive their conclusion.  \n\n\n**List of Experiments I have right now:**\n\n1. Energy loss when a ball bounces (Bounce a ball and measure the difference in potential Energy)\n2. Kinetic Energy gained in rolling down a slope (different height, different angles)\n3. Loss of brightness of light source over distance (use a smart phone a light sensor and measure brightness over distance)\n4. Energy stored in a popsicle catapult (change angle or number or rubber bands and measure range of projectile)",

        "text": "Let me preface this by just saying I know Copenhagen is the widely accepted interpretation and is how I was taught QM, but I let my mind wander and came up with this thought. As the title suggests, I'm curious if quantum entanglement is the result of Many-Worlds? I am no expert on MWI by any means, so that's why I am asking you good folks. \n\nTo my understanding, when two entangled particles, let's say that have zero total spin, are placed very far from each other (e.g. opposite ends of the universe). Then, if we collapsed one particle's wavefunction (as per Copenhagen) and observed the spin, we'd instantly know the spin of the other particle and collapse its wavefunction faster than the speed of light.\n\nWell, how about Many-Worlds that states each time a particle is observed, it is instead creating a bifurcation of both possibilities which is apart of the sum making one universal wavefunction. Well, would this mean that when we measure an entangled particle, we randomly observe a particle of spin up, and so we split into this bifurcated world where the other particle must be down. \n\nWhat got me thinking about this was the Nobel Prize this year and Bell's inequality. If I have any misunderstandings about the above topics, please correct me. I'm just curious and looking for a discussion. Cheers",

I don't really place a high probability on the fact that simply mixing two well understood components would create a world changing invention, but I don't have the background to prove myself wrong and my lay-intuition can't see why it wouldn't work. So please tell me why it wouldn't work, or wouldn't be worth doing.\n\nIt would effectively be a heatpump combustion engine.\n\nthe basic premise is extremely simple: we start with a typical heatpump setup, but, instead of expanding the refrigerant into fins to draw heat from the ambient environment; we allow a fixed amount of the refrigerant into a cylinder and use the expansion to drive a piston. two of these on a harmonic cycle with each other would act like a two stroke engine that could drive a flywheel. like a normal engine it would take a bit power to get it running; but the \"fuel\" would just be the temperature differential between the earth and the combustion chamber.\n\nif that would work in principle, there would likely be analogs for all types of combustion engines and/or turbines",

I am pretty sure I started in the fall of  2010 and finished in the spring of 2011.\n\nFast  forward a decade, and I am enrolling in a Masters program that involves  learning a foreign language. Since being accepted, I cannot decide if I  want to start over with a language considered “easier to learn” for  English speakers, such as Spanish or Italian, or stick with Russian.  Although I was not the best student in my younger years, I feel like I  understand the Cyrillic alphabet along with a good amount of vocabulary  words.\n\nEven  though I find Russia extremely fascinating and think it would open some  doors career wise, Spanish would probably be better considering the  demographic shift of the United States. With that said, however, Russian  language proficiency might be more valuable in the future considering  less people know it along with Putin’s aggressive actions on the world  stage.\n\nThe  part of learning the Russian language that scares me is the cases. I  never understood them and have not found a decent explanation online  during my recent research. After taking Russian, I always thought German  might be a good language to learn for me because I will struggle with  the pronunciations in the Romance languages, yet it would be more “do  able” or “realistic” than Russian. Turns out, German has cases as well!\n\nBasically,  I think I am asking what would be easier: Option 1: Learning a milder  Romance language starting from square one, or Option 2: Learning Russian  with A маленький и очень плохо understanding of the language. While I  realize this is a hard question, I am fearful I may not be able to learn  the Russian cases.\n\nThank you for your time, and I would welcome any input on this matter!",

Why wouldn’t scientist assume the black hole is actually a 1 meter diameter sphere?  Obviously this is just an arbitrary example, but there are so many diameters the black hole could have that DONT break the known laws of physics.  I have heard the argument that “no known forces are strong enough to stop the star from collapsing completely”.   Though it seems the natural conclusion that should be drawn is that the there is a force that we haven’t discovered yet.  \n\n\nOne additional question:  If a star forming a black hole collapses at a finite rate, doesn’t it mean that it collapses forever into an infinitesimally small point?",

This is because the amount of work done by an electric field is proportional to the rate of change in the stator's capacitance.\n\nRecording of presentation at:\nhttps://youtu.be/f7eoWkomD2E \n\nThe article and recording can be found at: https://positive-electron.com",

        "text": "So two years ago, I decided in high school to go to college and major in chemistry because my high school AP chem teacher was great and made it seem like something I would really enjoy (for the record, my AP physics teacher kinda sucked). So I get to school, and in my first two semesters I have to take Physics I and II. And something kinda just... clicked. It just scratched a part of my brain and I couldn't get enough of it, so I decided to go for a physics minor just cause and enrolled in the next physics course for my 3rd semester.\n\nMeanwhile, chemistry is just... meh. It turns out all of the parts of AP chem that I liked were just physics in disguise. I don't hate it per say, but I'm in organic right now and with that course especially I just do not find it engaging (too squishy). I'm not bad at it, I've gotten As in all my chem courses so far, but it just feels like work. And the labs especially are... not my favorite.\n\nWhich brings us to now, at the end of the third semester. So obviously at this point I \\*want\\* to switch to a physics major with a chem minor, but I'm worried I'm making a mistake. The problem isn't the classes, chem and physics majors take most of the same things their first 3 semesters so that wouldn't really be an issue. I just have no idea what I would do with a physics major once I finish, or how hard it would be to find a job, or how much money I would make. I have no plan and no clue where to even start. I'm just so worried about going through with my chem major and ending up doing something I don't care about forever. \n\nSo to anyone who majored in physics, do you regret it? What are you doing now, are you happy doing it? I guess I just want someone to either tell me I'm being an idiot for thinking about this, or for not doing it sooner. Thanks!",
