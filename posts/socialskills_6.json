I get very anxious and pressured when it's just me and another person, so I have a tough time keeping conversations going and opening up. I was wondering if you guys know of any good resources or ways I can practice talking to people one-on-one in real time (like phone calls, IRL, etc.), not over chat/text. I considered a retail or barista job before I realized they wouldn't really help since there's not much prolonged conversation involved, and I would do bartending but I don't drink. I'm also not comfortable connecting with strangers online. Are there other ways I can practice? If not, do you think I should consider therapy?",

        "text": "I used to be very close with a few people I met through some events in the industry I'm in. After over a year of chatting in group texts all the time and going to many events with them, I started to realize our group was fairly toxic and decided I needed to separate myself from it. That was spring 2020, so covid basically made that much easier for me.\n\nA couple of them still will talk to me sometimes, but after being pretty distant from them, I don't have any desire to hang out with these people any more. There are some events coming up that they will all be at and I'm positive they will talk to me there, and ask me why I stopped talking to them and I don't really know what to say or how I should act around them.\n\nIt's not like any of them did one big bad thing to me, but they are all very negative, criticize each other, complain about their own misfortunes, and badmouth others and I just don't want to be like that any more or be around it any more. From what I've seen of them on social media, it looks like most of them are still this way and haven't made the same effort to change that I have.\n\nAll I can think to do is pretend like I don't know them, and that's not really my style, but I would feel very uncomfortable trying to have an honest conversation about why I stopped talking to them *at* the event especially if they tried teasing me for \"being a stranger\"\n\nI also don't have any desire to talk to them about why I don't want to hang out with them anymore. I mentioned before quarantine started as I was already distancing myself from them that I found the dynamic to be toxic, though I think the ones I mentioned that to might not have had the self awareness to know I was talking about them.\n\nRegardless, I don't feel that it's my job to teach these people to not be toxic, and many of them act like \"ask-holes\", being addicted to asking for advice and have poor boundaries, and I have the sense that if I try and give them honest feedback about their behavior, they may just keep hounding me for more advice.",

        "text": "I’m a 19f and for the past few months I’ve had absolutely no friends besides my bf. I had some friends at my first college. It was a 4 year university and I lived in a dorm. It was easier meeting people because I’d just hangout in the common area and have conversations with people. I hung out with them sometimes in their dorms or at the park. Every once in a while we’d have a fun night out. I moved and tried to stay in contact with them but I had to constantly keep asking my bf to give me an hour ride to see them because no one wanted to drive to see me. I completely get that but I just wanted them to maybe meet me halfway but that was still too much for them.\n\nI transferred to a community college because of money issues sometime last year and I’ve made zero friends. I feel absolutely alone, I’m envious of people who are my age and have fun on weekends. I literally don’t talk to any one besides my bf most days and I hate it. All I want is to have friends who I can care for and care for me too. \n\nI tried joining clubs at schools, but everyone seems reserved and the club meeting times were not working for me. I downloaded those online friends app and the people there never respond. The one girl I hung out on there kept using me and venting constantly it drained me. I used to approach ppl in my school but they respond as though they are busy or don’t want to talk to me. For example, I see a girl and tell her I like her shoes where are they from? She says thanks and just leaves.\n\nI just want to make friends but I don’t know what to do anymore. I need advice please.",

I remember they were just puppies; what about the couch they broke? What about your mom? Did she have another baby like she said she wanted? Did you finish college? How did your acne treatment go?\".\n\nI was sincerelly curious of how she was doing, and i got answers, but i gotta admit it really hurt being the only one asking questions and her just responding with one-syllabes, completely uninterested.\n\nI eventually got tired of this and i went straight ahead:\n\n\"Hey, the reason i contacted you was because i thought we could be friends since we really got along back in those times, but i know it wont be posible, so im quite happy getting that off my chest, i wish you luck in life!\"\n\nAnd she writes: \"i don't think we have much in common to be friends. If we were friends was just because we sat together in classroom and we were forced to interact\"\n\n...\n\nWas she being petty? Was she trying to hurt me for the last time?\n\nI don't feel it was necesary for her to say something so heartless. She could've just said goodbye or a \"yeah you're right, wish you luck from now on\"...\n\nOr something...\n\nYeah, it really hurt to know what she really thought about our 3 years of friendship, how she summarized those 3 years with laughs and tears together with a \"we sat together in classroom and we were forced to talk to each other\" like it didn't mean nothing to her, really hurt deep down.\n\nI talked about this with my boyfriend a day after when i couldn't hold this to myself anymore and he was there consoling me while i was crying on his chest like a baby. That really helped me with the heartache.\n\nBut ever since that, it also made me completely lose interest in having friends again.\n\nOr at least, it made me very cautious of what type of people try to get close to me.\n\nI don't have traumatic thoughts like \"is she talking to me because she wants to or is it because i'm next to her?; i dont want to meet this new person, we won't be having anything in common anyway\"\n\nIt's more like \"meh... i dont want to\"\n\nI learned the hard way that people from the past, stays in the past, and not everyone who wants to meet me deserves a bit of my time.\n\nWhile i don't get the lonely feeling anymore and i really enjoy just existing in solitude, i'm worried if it's okay for me to end up molded like this?",

Or who knows, maybe I'm mistaking tolerance for actual affection, but I digress. One thing that just made it painfully obvious for me that I'm not accepted as part of the group is that I just saw a Facebook post in my news feed of pictures from last night of the various people who are there every Friday night and I was never asked to participate or be in any of these pictures and I try to act like I'm too cool to care, but it hurts my feelings. I wouldn't care if I've only been going there for a couple weeks, but I've been going this place every Friday since August, so by this point they know me well enough.",

I then commented under her post to say I sent her a message under the Meet-up chat function and she said:\n\n“Hey sorry i didn't see this.

Over whatsapp and instagram I had continued our convo with some text but I didn't get any reply to them ever after a week or more has passed (both platform had different convo topics so i didn't change platform to get response). Now she sees my stories though and I understand sometimes people just don't want to text but this pattern has been observed couple of times since we have been friends. She always apologise for being a bad texter or replying so late which I get it but nevertheless it's always frustrating. \nNow I'm more of a texter though i also prefer face to face. She did her abroad semester here and hence now she went back so face to face meetings will no be possible anymore which i would have preferred to do in between. I do text a lot when in flow, it's just how i text. Not smothering someone (may feel like it to them though) but I've been introvert and never mixed with people much until start of my 20s. I want to maintain the friendship with her. How can I deal with this issue of over texting, not getting replies anxiety and seriously following more healthy approach?\n\nNote: whenever we used to meet, we talked almost for hours on end and always had a decent time together, group or 1v1. So she being mean is not an issue. She does have a bf and now i understand that going back home will change many things. So it does affect our friendship a bit which is totally out of my control. I'm making myself ready to be prepared mentally if this friendship is to reach dead end.",

In other words, I can't control the anxiety but I can control what situations I put myself in. \n\nAfter coming to that realization, I finally got myself to start going to a group at my church for 20s and 30, which is something I had been considering for over a year so that was a nice win! It's a great group of people and they're all very nice. \n\nThe problem is that the anxiety is still there at full strength, and it keeps me from being myself and even being able to think straight. I'm just stuck in a brain fog. It's almost like I'm frozen. My heart literally beats so hard that I have chest pains and I feel like I can't breathe. I just can't seem to override that part of my brain. \n\nAll of this keeps me from being able to think of what to say, and it's so frustrating because it feels impossible to respond to even simple questions from people without coming off like an awkward mess. \n\nTl;dr: I've finally started forcing myself to do social things, but the symptoms of anxiety make it feel impossible to think, be myself, and connect with people.

It makes me feel like a zoo animal. And she DOESN’T ask. She just does it. Like wtf we aren’t in the salon anymore! I paid my dues and even tipped her and the services is done like why does she still feel the need to touch my hair every time she sees me?! Ugh.",

Its like nobody respects me and cared what I got to say. And I hate myself for opening up to others who don't care to listen when I speak. I hate that  I have the respect to those who didn't deserve it by listening to them way more than the other way around. I'm 28 now and it's been this way my whole life. From here on out I'm putting my foot down  If somebody speaking to me I'm more likely than not going to half ass listen  or just not pay attention to them at all. If somebody actually has a question for me then that would warrant a response. In that case I'll give said individual a concise, straightforward apathetic response.\nI don't care if people get salty for never never speaking. People confuse being quiet for being self absorbed and arrogant.. I don't speak no more because when I did most people didn't care \n\n\nI can feel it all in their body language that these type of folk got issues with me. They disdain the way I choose to move  \n\nSome of them will even talk I'll of me behind my back to others.

I find that very offensive. These type of folk can shove it. Straight up. \nSee, people gotta match my energy. \n\nI had short periods where I got fed up of being treated as unimportant that I withdrew myself.

They went from having an uninteresting/ uncaring body language towards me, to being funny acting with a look disgust towards me.  \n\nThese were only short periods of me being dead silent until I wanted to socialize with the world again. That was a mistake.\n I'm training myself to have it enbedded in me to never speak again. I could give a damn how anybody feel cause they didn't give a damn bout how I felt.\nI only know of 1 non relative who embraced me. They care about what I got to say. We have good conversations. Thats my non blood brother. I give them that same energy because of all the love this brother showed.\n\n I relate love to respect. It's all about respect.

        "author": "Droppedby365",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/11onoda/pride_good_or_bad/",
        "text": "Disclaimer: this post is only discussing the feeling of pride of one's obtained achievements, accomplishments, development, etc. If you are proud of characteristics that you were born with (i.e. nationality, colour of skin, etc), or defining characteristic that you didn't choose or work towards (ancestry, inheritance, etc) this is not the post for you. Also, you are dumb. End of disclaimer.\n\nSome time ago a friend told me \"before I met you somebody had told me you are too proud\". My friend said it as if the description \"proud\" is bad thing. He also said that now that he met me he doesn't think of me as \"too proud\". \n\nI didn't know what to think of this statement. Therefore, I never gave a solid answer to my friend. This is mainly because I do think that I am a proud person and I don't think it is necessarily a bad thing. I am proud of my academic and professional journey, I am proud of the ways I have supported friends, girlfriends, and family in the past, I am proud of my altruistic job, I am proud of my closeness to the people I choose, I am proud of my proactiveness in social interactions (apologising before I am confronted, or complimenting someone out of the blue), I am proud of helping stray animals, I am proud of my 8+ years of volunteer work at 31 years of age, I am proud of my physical condition, I am proud of my fighting spirit when it truly matters, and the list goes on...\n\nNaturally, I started thinking about what this other person could have meant by \"too proud\". If pride is a good thing, why did they present my pride as a negative? In my view, a person who is proud is generally not submissive, is assertive, has good leadership skills, provides constructive feedback and criticism when necessary, is confident, etc. You get the gist. \n\nLet's play this little mental game. Name the first historical figure you think of when you hear the word \"proud\". Go!\n\n... You thought of Hitler, didn't you? 😁 Well, the bastard is the most used historical example, so it's expected. But besides the square-moustached mean man with arm ankylosis, I also thought of Che Guevara, Nelson Mandela, Gandhi, Martin Luther King, even Jesus of Nazareth. Yes, even Jesus was proud in my opinion. Only a man deeply proud of his message is willing to undergo so many hardships and to die in order to communicate it.\n\nIn that sense, isn't pride a virtue? I think yes. I always thought yes. I think of pride as a synonym for dignity, poise, and self-esteem. But if it is a virtue, then why does it stick out so much when put it side-by-side with some other virtues?\n\nGenerosity\nHonesty\nJustice\nPatience\nKindness \nWisdom\nHumility\n*Pride*\n\nIt just doesn't stick. Especially next to humility. Proud people tend to demonstrate a lot of resistance to receiving advice from others. They are generally stubborn. This is the opposite of humility, isn't it? Interestingly, however, pride sticks well next to some virtues like assertiveness, courage, and perseverance. \n\nThen you put it next to vices. \n\nVanity\nArrogance\nLicentiousness \n*Pride*\n\nIt sticks with them too, doesn't it? This is interesting... It seems to me that pride can be a jack of all trades. It is a virtue when you need it to be a virtue, and a vice when you need it to be a vise. This is why both Hitler and Jesus came to mind during my previous mental game. \n\nNow, let's assume for a second that pride is only a bad thing. If it is only a bad thing, one should choose to be the opposite of that solely bad thing in order to be good, right? So what is the opposite of proud? \n\nShameful\nLowly\nMeek\nUnimportant (?)\nUndignified\nModest \nHumble \n\nI can go with the last two, but I can never allow myself to be any of the first five. So I guess I will be proud for life with some hints of modesty and humbleness. Is this a good compromise? I think yes. At the end of the day, we are left with three definitions for pride and two out of the three seem positive to me (I am not Machiavelli resurrected, I promise). Hear me out.\n\n1. The positive feeling someone feels when they have achieved (or tried to achieve) something worthwhile, which results to their self-development. This feeling is impinged upon when someone insults their achievement. \n\n2. The feeling one gets when they realise their value as human. This feeling is impinged upon when someone insults their human dignity. \n\n3. The excessive sense of self-importance and self-worth. A feeling of being better than others. An overfed ego in the shape and size of Jabba the Hutt.\n\nThis is now starting to unfold... It seems like pride is a jack of all trades after all. This is why it is used in situations so radically different from each other. Like LGBTQ+ Pride 🌈 and The Proud Boys 💩, Hitler and Jesus. Perhaps the Bible was a bit too fast to place pride amongst the 7 Deadly Sins. \n\nWhat is your opinion? Write your own thoughts in the comments and let's see if we can bring some salvation to pride or if it deserves to be forever stigmatised.",

I can't seem to explain my reasoning behind anything without being told I'm giving excuses. \n\nHow do you convey your reasoning behind things without coming off as if you are trying to excuse yourself?",

For the last year I have a feeling that people are using me and due to my lack of social skills I am not really sure what I can do.\n\nI was always better at listening rather than talking. And I don't really have problem with that. But now it feels like the only thing I can do is listening. I am not going to lie, I am usually bored with what they are saying, but I think they just need to be heard, so I listen. \n\nFor example, my boyfriend talks to me all the time about what happened to him at work (in like really long monologues) and I have always listened. But when I do the talking, he is not listening to me. I was mad and the other time I didn't listen and he was mad that I am doing other things instead of listening, wtf.\n\nOr my mom, she also is telling me what is happening in her work, but when I want to share something with her, she is not listening to me and when I asked why, she told me that I am telling her unimportant things. And I am. But I think things like what happened the other day to her coworker is unimportant too. But yet I still do listen.\n\nMy friends are also telling me all of the meaningless things that happened to them, but are not willing to listen what I want to share.\n\nWhat I can do? Can it be my fault, that they are behaving this way? Or should I just say that I care, if they don't care?",

I lack the knowledge in the topics they talk about most of the time and don't know where to bring in solving this issue.\n\n\nI'm not sure how to formulate this question but I will try my best. Personally, whenever I am in a group of newl met \"friends\", which most of the time are friends if my brother, I tend to sit back and just listen to their conversations. I don't add much to the conversation and that spirals down to a couple of reasons, that I tried to understand about myself:\n1. I'm an introvert. I can be extroverted/an ambivert but that only happened with people that I connect with and that I don't mind judging me. So I stay quiet in gatherings with strangers and that boils down to new reasons (below)\n2. I stay quiet because I have this thought about myself that I'm not as intelligent as anyone in the group, I feel inferior compared to them regarding having a great grasp of knowledge, mostly in any topic they are talking about, so I would rather stay quiet since I see myself below them and.\n3. I try to avoid asking questions because I will end up looking really, really dumb and with me being 25, I compare myself to these people who are also my age &amp; know so much more than I do about politics in example, or economy, or history of some country (the list can go on forever, because I'm too aware of the topics I'm not well versed at), so, I stay quiet and understand very little from the topic being talked to.\n4. I had previous experiences where I did talk and asked something which embarrassed me (these situations were with my family), or I had said something and couldn't keep the conversation going because I didn't have as much background info memorised for that topic.\n\nI tried to solve these points by being more relaxed, remind myself to TALK instead of listen only, not to compare myself to anyone else around me &amp; lastly, start my journey in learning everything from scratch (recently started, so not much progress in this).\n\nBut after all of this, I still feel like I don't belong with anyone who knows so much or more than I do in certain topics, so I end up having this exact pov of myself, which is summarised in me being below average about my general knowledge/ intelligence. This affects my thoughts, feelings, moods, confidence &amp; work performance on a daily basis. I tried to snap out of it from time to time but It feels like its a \"fact\" more than a thought now. I feel like I have the \"looks\" but not much intelligence. Like I just have a face and that's it.\n\nMy question is, did you ever feel this way, especially being 25 years old or older, and are you trying to solve it?\n\nSorry for the long post, and thank you for reading all of it.",

She always apologise for being a bad texter or replying so late which I get it but nevertheless it's always frustrating. \nNow I'm more of a texter though i also prefer face to face. She did her abroad semester here and hence now she went back so face to face meetings will no be possible anymore which i would have preferred to do in between.

You could be an important or respected person, and there's nothing wrong with that. But allowing yourself to let loose a bit can free your thoughts and result in better clarity and assessment of the moment. I loved giving myself some slack, which in turn improved my productivity and usefulness with the team at work. Above all, I wanted to share this with you guys because it made it so much easier to talk with people. When you stop worrying too much about what others think, and you're chill with making a fool of yourself at times, conversations become fun and you can express yourself better.

        "text": "TLDR; brainstorming ways to keep friendships alive when separated by life\n\nFor me, High school was easy because you see these people everyday and thus don’t need to go out of your way to maintain friendships. \n\nHowever now I’m in university and a common theme is the difficulty of how to maintain these friendships when it’s very inconsistent how often I see them. Sometimes the whole week, sometimes not for weeks. \n\nI only really keep contact with my best friend from Highschool. But our connection is so deep I can just text him whatever and vice versa—we have similar humor, interests, video games. It’s effortless\n\nBut it’s not so easy with people I’m not that deep with. I value our friendships but I don’t know how to stay connected.   I don’t keep contact with any other prior school friend anymore \n\nMy current thinking is: in order to stay connected you to interact somehow. It’ll rarely be physically like in school. I’m a 21 year old zoomer so keep that in mind for my social setting. \n - Do I really text a normal non-close friend how his day was? Texting usually seems very formal and too high-stakes. but I might be wrong, tell me if so\n - I don’t like Snapchat but I might bite the bullet and use it again to have low-stakes interactions with friends. \n - I use instagram reel/meme sending, but rarely so I’m thinking about expanding that. Great for low stakes interaction\n - what about phone calls? People my age generally don’t unless urgent, but it can be short and sweet to interact.\n - I meet up with people/ groups, but this usually comes after when we spend time together physically at Uni, so it’s less maintaining more deepening what is. \n\nWhat else is there and what do you recommend?",

        "text": "Thank you if you read this or have any advice for me! (I’m 22f)\n\nI have a back patio which has railing on two sides and a tall wall on the left side of it, so that no one can see in. On the other side of the wall is an empty field which is turned into a horse pen. My neighbour rents it so his daughter can ride her horses there. \n\nThe story starts last summer.\n\nA family member and I were sitting on my patio when I heard the girl from the neighbours  talking to someone on the other side of the wall. (I think she made sure I can hear them.)\n\nShe mentioned my name and she accoused me of taking a photo of her and her brother.🤯🤯At first I had no idea what she was talking about and I was obv. pissed off. 😤I would never take a photo of them, I had no reason to. My fam. mem.and I were just kind of starring at each other confused since she knows I’d never do something like that. \n\nLater I realized that she might have been talking about that one evening I was taking photos of the sky from my window. Maybe it seemed like I was taking a photo of them but I wasn’t, I was just photographing the sunset and the cloudes. (Btw photography is my hobby and no neighbour has ever had a problem with me taking photos before.) \n\nI wanted to talk to her and explain that I was just taking some sunset pictures but everyone told me not to. They said it was her problem and she should come talk to me but she never did.🤷‍♀️\n\nAfter accusing me, she went onto criticisising my apparance. Then came a bunch of private personal information came up about me that I never shared with her in my life. She was criticising my life at this point. I had no idea where she knew those things from bc she doesn’t know me at all.🤨\n\nMy fam.member told me that she probably knows my private informations because while she was out with her horse, she most likely eavesdropped on my conversations that I had on my patio before. She was basically listening from the other side of my patio wall. 😧😦\n\nAfter all this we noticed that she started hiding her facebook posts from me for some reason.😂\n\nA couple of months later something weird started happening. At the time I did not think the two situations were linked to each other. \n\nI registered to Linked in, where I had my personal e-mail adress shared as a way to contact me. This was visible to everyone who searched my name on Google.\n\nI started getting notifications that someone was trying to log into my Fb, Ig, Twitter, Gmail and even my Apple id. This went on for months but they could not get into any of my accounts. \n\nAfter a while I had enough and I looked up the IP adress that was trying to log into my accounts.\nI came back as my neighbours IP 😮😮🤯😲\nI was shook and extremly angry to say the least. What the hell did they want from me😡\n\n(Also during this time, a fake Fb account sent me a friends request and weirdly enough all their info on their profile matched my interest to a tea, their workplace, the pages they liked etc. I can’t prove that this was the neighbour girl but I have a strong suspicion it was.)\n\nI recetly changed my passwords and email adresses to all my accounts and I blocked her on everything.\n\nI thought that with this it was over and I moved on, however I have to admit that lately she’s been bothering me a lot.🤔\n\nI keep running into her on the street when I leave my house all the time. She stares at me and either makes faces or sneers at me. \n\nAt first, I though it was just a coincidence that we keep runing into each other but today she literally waited for me to leave. She was standing outside my house with her horse and she started walking in front of my car when I was about to leave. She stared and sneered at me. Even my friend who was with me noticed the whole thing.",

        "text": "**Quick Details:**\n\nI have social anxiety, autism, and an IQ of 170. Note: I mention this because many people unfortunately assume autism = stupid, and that's simply not the case. However, autism can cause certain social difficulties, such as Low Affect (not showing emotions), or focusing on different aspects of a conversation (I focus on logic far more often than emotions).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Problem:**\n\nThe Social Issue I frequently find myself running into is this: many people attempt to \"Railroad\" &gt;!(to push through hastily)!&lt; me during conversations. This is not because I don't stand up for myself; on the contrary, I usually try to be very forthright. I believe what is happening is that I overwhelm people with detail-oriented thinking to a point where they no longer feel in control, and, in an attempt to regain control, they try to Railroad me. I will try to give 2 quick examples of this in different scenarios:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **1st Example:** The other day I was in a healthcare-billing-related meeting. Before, during, and after the meeting I was asked to sign a total of 65 pieces of legally-binding paperwork. I explained to the woman I was dealing with that I would need some time to review the paperwork. She seemed surprised, and asked me to explain what I was concerned about. I explained that I never sign anything without taking the time to read all of it. She did not seem to accept this (logical) answer, and kept trying to ask me \"Why\" I was so concerned. She behaved as if she was put-upon by me, when all I wanted was some time to read what I was being asked to sign.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **2nd Example:** About a year ago I was at a doctor's appointment for my child. I was speaking to the Doctor, and they were explaining some potential medical red flags. I did what I always do, and asked about \"the odds\" (the reason being: 1 in 10 odds is much more likely than 1 in 1,000,000,000 odds). The Doctor did what they always do, and responded to me with a non-numerical answer: \"It's rare.\" I (very-politely) asked for a numerical answer (because \"Rare\" means different things to different people). Once again, the other person (a doctor in this case) became annoyed, and, instead of just answering my question, started to ask me \"What I was so worried about?\" I explained I wasn't worried - but that the numerical odds would allow us to properly calculate the risks associated with treatment. For some reason, a Medical Doctor did not understand why this was extremely relevant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**My Question:** Does anyone have some good advice about how to deal with these kinds of people? Essentially, I think what may be happening is that I make people feel uncomfortable by asking them detailed questions (when they do need to be asked).\n\n**Please note:**\n\n1. I frequently run into this situation (probably &gt;= 50% of the time).\n2. I believe my mannerisms (autism + social anxiety) cause me to \"act strangely\". Examples: not using typical facial expressions, flat-affect, robotic tone of voice, etc. This is not something I control consciously, and it's really not something I can \"fix.\" I have attempted to \"fix\" it in the past with mixed results: either I weird people out even more, or I make them feel comfortable enough to ignore my questions.\n3. I have a large amount of mathematic and legal knowledge which I cannot \"just ignore.\" I mention this because many people have claimed that I \"overthink things\". I can see, from their point of view, that it appears like I'm overthinking when, in reality, I'm just operating at my natural, baseline level of thought. An analogy would be to ask: \"Is Bobby Fischer &gt;!(famous chess player)!&lt; 'overthinking things' when he plays Chess?\" - No, of course not. He is 'thinking' at his baseline level of thought, which just-so-happens to be much higher than an average chess-player's level of thought.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you to the r/socialskills community for your assistance.",

I've reassured that I will keep it a secret.\n\nThat isn't the problem though, yesterday they just keep side eyeing me and B and gives us dry replies when we talk to them, sometimes not even responding. I've told them that if they feel like they don't want to talk, they could go to the library during school but no, they just stay there and it feels so awkward.\nB recently came up to me and asked if I felt that A was off, I've made an excuse for A as I've promised to not say a word.\nI've told A about what B said , and A didn't even give me any form of response to me that I had to ask them if they could hear me or not. \nB got so frustrated by the amount of times A doesn't reply and stopped talking to her, which means I have to put in effort to ensure it doesn't feel awkward which sucks because I'm the only one initiating.\nI've tried to include them as much as possible but they act like they don't want to be a part of it which is frustrating, if you don't want to be included and talk, why are you even here with us?

( I was in my early 20s at the time) During this time I had the support of my close family members.\n\nLong story short, I got the diagnosis several months before the pandemic and was unable to function like a normal healthy person (i.e. I couldn't walk at times, would sleep more than usual, and was very weak overall).\n\nSeveral Months into the pandemic, I decided to reach out to one of the friends from my former friend group just to offer an explanation. She first started out by saying she understood that I needed some space, but then later proceeded to get upset with me for not reaching out sooner. Prior to me struggling with this illness, this particular friend played the blame game a lot and I felt as though the friendship was draining at times.\n\nI felt very embarrassed and vulnerable as at the time I was still very ill. I went from being a very vibrant person, to being a shell of who I really was, so it was very tough at the time.\n\nNo one else in this group ever them reached out to me at any point either. I always felt like I was the 'therapist' friend or the 'helper' friend in the group prior to my diagnosis, and I was tired of being that person to them.\n\nI can't tell sometimes if I did the right thing.

        "text": "I’m very excited and nervous about a new job that I was recently hired to. The only thing that’s been on my mind about being hired was the fact that I would have to talk to people and get sales, which will require me to talk and be social.\n\nI’m a introvert and have trouble keeping up with conversations. I feel choked up and get social anxiety when I talk to people because my mind constantly wonders what they think of me or how they feel about me sometimes. I’m trying to overcome it for my position since it’s better than my last job position, but I just need some advice on holding conversations and talking in general. Does anyone have some tips or advice? I am very open to all as I would love to try it out on my future clients. \n\nThank you! :)",

I don't even know what to say or how to feel anymore, I just wish I knew how to break out of this fake persona I have in front of everyone and just be myself, because right now it feels like I'm an actor having to put on a show every single day and man, it is so, so tiring. I crave socialization even though it sucks the life out of me. I don't know what's wrong with me. I just want to know how to change.",
