For that site, it was explained, that would be an \"overdue earthquake.\" And when suck an  earthquake eventually takes place, it is typically stronger than normal.\n\nBut several scientists have explained to me that this does NOT hold true for tsunamis generated by earthquakes, such as the tsunamis that regularly hit Hawaiian islands.

This would mean you get a return on the profits as a result of your investment. If my foundational knowledge is wrong, please correct me.\n\nI have more specific questions related to this:\n\n1. Is a company \"limited\" in the number of shares it can put out? Ie can a company say \"we are splitting the company into 100 shares, first come first serve\"?\n2. If a company's shares are hypothetically unlimited, and one stakeholder owns 10% of the shares, can I just buy enough shares to make other peoples' shares irrelevant?\n3. If shares are limited, what happens when everyone is just holding onto their shares? Can someone forcibly buy my shares from me?\n4. Can a company \"split\" their shares? If so, why wouldn't this make shares worth less or more? Same with \"making more shares\" or \"reducing shares\".\n5. How does a company starting out decide how much their shares are worth, since shares on the open market seem to be driven by the market?\n6. What's the difference between public vs private shares?",

Over the past decade or so, when I've seen people on social media attempting to give away or sell (for the same or lower value) event tickets, the tickets usually end up not getting used and people call the seller a \"scalper.\" \n\nI could see why it would be frowned upon if one were to attempt to resell the tickets for a higher value. But why is it also just as bad if the tickets are being sold for a lower value or offered for free? Maybe there's some entertainment-industry context I'm missing?",
