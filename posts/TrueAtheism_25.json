He explained how people are a lot more likely to agree and believe you when you sound confident and act like you know what your talking about.

        "text": "[Part 1: Discovering the similarities between the self-reported origin stories of infant religions](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/3kxa0v/exmormon_reading_the_quran_discovering_the/)\n\nI'll keep posting these as long as I find relevant things to talk about. I can see that as time goes on, I will find fewer parallels between Mormonism and Islam, and more content that are just general musings. However, my religious upbringing will probably cause me to interpret things differently than a Muslim would interpret them, so I'll keep the same title. Plus, continuity.\n\nI just finished the ~~first~~ *second* surah, \"The Cow\" (the first one is just a page long, and consists of a few verses kissing up to Allah). I listened to it and some of the next surah on the \"Quranify Me\" podcast on the way into work. I did not read the text by myself like I wanted, but ain't nobody gone time fo dat.\n\nTo start, I did see some more parallels, the first are major.\n\n-----\n\n**Propagation of Biblical errors both from the Direct Word of Allah to Muhammad and from the Holy Ghost to Nephi**\n\nThere are two major errors that both the Quran and the Book of Mormon make, and to me, they are show-stoppers. Both come from the Gospel of Luke, Chapters 1 and 2.\n\n1. The mere existence of Luke 1&amp;2 is wrong. [Here's a blog talking about it.](http://ehrmanblog.org/did-luke-originally-have-chapters-1-2/). Basically, Luke starts in Chapter 3, and chapters 1 and 2 were added later. This includes the entire Nativity story - the wise men, the shepherds, and particularly the story of John the Baptist's cousinship to Jesus, and Zechariah's disbelief and muting. The Quran references the story of John the Baptist being related to Jesus, which is exclusive to Luke 1&amp;2, and the BOM also draws from references from the same chapters. This shows a simplistic understanding of the Bible by Muhammad and Joseph Smith. Both authors take the Bible at face value, keep the errors, and write their own material with the errors included.\n\n2. Mary wasn't supposed to be a virgin. The Bible is a collection of fragmented documents which were not written at the same time or the same place. It can almost be forgiven for having so many mistakes. But the Quran is supposed to be the literal first-person voice of God speaking, and he says that Mary was a virgin, and includes the Annunciation of Gabriel from Luke 1&amp;2. Oops. The Book of Mormon, particularly 2nd Nephi, quotes a vision of the Holy Ghost to Nephi, saying that Mary was a virgin. Both books propagate the Biblical error of Mary being a virgin, making it a direct quote from deity.\n\n-----\n\n**Both religions have an economic system that their congregants insist would make the world a better place if everyone did it**\n\nIn \"The Cow\" you learn about donating 2.5% of your income to the poor (or rather, donating it to the church, who will distribute it to the poor). In Mormonism, you learn about donating 10% of your \"increase\" to the church.\n\nEach religion has its own level of enthusiasm for spreading their own practice to be the law of the land. Islam has Shariah. Mormonism has [shitty Pinterest memes.](http://i.imgur.com/uURxBK7.jpg) Islam forbids taking interest on loans, while Mormonism endorses Red-blooded American Capitalism, so they differ there.\n\nI don't know about Muslims, but Mormons LOVE the idea of a flat tax -- that it would be fair to both the wealthy and the poor. They fail to realize that a family making $30,000/year needs that $3,000 much more than a family who making $100,000/year needs that $10,000. The readers' opinions here on income taxes is probably going to vary widely, and I'm not trying to start a debate on it here. I'm just saying that Mormons have an internal need to justify how every aspect of their religion is perfect, how following the religion makes you happy and financially rich (prosperity doctrine is a core tenet of Mormonism, just see the [Nephite Price Cycle](http://byustudies.byu.edu/book_of_mormon_charts/charts/144.jpg) straight from a BYU lesson manual. So, if the government adopted Mormon tithing concepts as their taxes, then America would be even better! I imagine that Muslims feel the same about implementing Shariah.\n\n-----\n\n**Hell**\n\nThe Bible really doesn't talk much about hell, or heaven for that matter. There are some freaky visions of the apocalypse, but as far as the eternal afterlife goes, the Quran, Book of Mormon, Pearl of Great Price, and Doctrine &amp; Covenants sure seem to know a lot about it.\n\nThe mainstream Mormon scriptures and the Quran are both pretty vanilla about it. Bad people go to hell, and it is a fire, and you burn forever.\n\n-----\n\n**Lack of calls to violence against unbelievers in Islam, and other misc stuff**\n\nSo after reading the longest Surah in the Quran, and part of the one after, I haven't encountered any verses that explicitly say that Muslims must kill unbelievers or anyone that believes in Islam with a slightly different flavor. However, it seems that every few verses do talk about the evils of unbelievers and how they are all hellbound, as well as those who don't obey Islam correctly, calling them all \"polytheists.\"\n\n\n*So far* I would not call the Quran a violent book, but I really wouldn't give it any credit for inspiring people to treat \"others\" well.\n\nOh yeah, a woman can only think half as well as a man. After forbidding the accumulation of interest on a loan, Allah says to simply write down all loans and have it witnessed by two men, OR... one man and two women \"so one can remind the other if she forgets.\"\n\n-----\n\nI'll add more things if I remember. See yall.",

        "text": "(copy/pasting this from my post to /r/exmuslim)\n\n-----\n\n\nI'm listening through the \"Quranify Me\" podcast. After each Surah (internal book, like \"Genesis\" or \"Joshua\"), I plan to read through them on my own, without the critical commentary.\n\nThere are a few points that stood out to me as an ex-Mormon, whether it was directly said, or I got a \"vibe\" from what was intended, or maybe my own personal bias as I read along. I could be wrong on these points, but this is what I have taken (spelling fix) from the first ~160 verses of \"The Cow\" (which is the first internal book within the Quran).\n\n-----\n\nISLAM / QURAN\n\n1. Every prophet that has ever existed was given the pure message of God, but was rejected by his people, and the original word of God was changed and apostasy occurred. Each apostasy was given a new prophet to preach the original word again.\n\n2. The Quran was perfectly written the first time, and has never been altered. It contains the fullness of God's law as it was originally intended. It is unadulterated by the philosophies of men. It is the most correct book on earth.\n\n3. It acknowledges Israel as God's chosen people, but they have lost the truth, but can still repent after hearing God's original message. The Quran is written in our days for the convincing of the Jews to come unto God again.\n\n4. Muhammad is God's prophet, and he proves that the Quran is true, and the Quran proves that he is a true prophet, and by this you shall know that Islam is God's kingdom upon the earth.\n\n-----\n\nMORMONISM / BOOK OF MORMON\n\nWith regard to [1], this is Mormonism in a nutshell. Adam was the first prophet, and he had the Original Full Law of God, including animal sacrifice and polygamy and priesthood, all the way through Noah and Abraham and Isaac and Jacob/Isreal and his son Joseph. After the Egyptian captivity, Israel was not ready for the full law, and so only received the preparatory lower Law of Moses. Moses and all the prophets knew the fuller laws, but Israel wasn't ready until Jesus came. Jesus gave the new law, which wasn't the full law still, despite him being the literal sexually-generated Son of God. Joseph Smith revealed the full law that Adam once had, but the US Government screwed it up, and now we can't do polygamy. Once Jesus comes back and the Jews re-build their temple, then we will do polygamy again and kill animals to make God happy.\n\nOn [2], there is a Mormon Article of Faith (official canon) that says \"We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly; we also believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God.\" Mormons teach that the Bible has additions and deletions by bad-guy scribes. The Book of Mormon is perfectly translated as it was written.\n\nOn [3], the Book of Mormon claims to be written to \"the house of Israel ... Written and sealed up, and hid up unto the Lord ... To come forth by the gift and power of God unto the interpretation thereof ... Which is to show unto the remnant of the house of Israel what great things the Lord hath done for their fathers; and that they may know the covenants of the Lord, that they are not cast off forever—And also to the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God.\"\n\nOn [4], the Book of Mormon also claims that those who read the Book of Mormon will \"gain a testimony of its truth and divinity\" and \"that Joseph Smith is His revelator and prophet in these last days, and that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints [Mormonism] is the Lord’s kingdom once again established on the earth, preparatory to the Second Coming of the Messiah.\"",

But the question of whether it is possible that a necessary being could exist is also interesting and needs to be wrestled with. If it is possible, then certain things follow logically. And since there is nothing contradictory between the notions of 'being' and 'necessary', we must admit it is possible (though not to say actual, just yet anyway). Or if you try to fight back and say it is impossible for God to exist, I can sit back and smoke my pipe for a good long while, watching an attempt to do what has never been done, and, I'd say, can't be done.    \n\n&gt; Since it is possible that a necessary being exists, we realize that this means if it exists, it would exist in every possible world, and not only the actual world. Then we must ask what would happen if it didn't exist in the actual world. If that were the case, then it would not exist in any world. More than that, we'd have to say that it *cannot* exist... it is impossible for it to exist if it doesn't exist now. But we have already admitted that it's existence is possible. Therefore, the only way it couldn't exist is if it were impossible for it to exist. Therefore, it does exist.\"\n\nIf I understood it correctly, his argument is the opposite of Russell's teapot?

Then it goes on to point out that much of C.S.

I post this because I just came back from visiting an English correspondent that has similar interests and had a discussion with him and his friends that ended ... quite badly. They ended up scorning my friend and I, but most importantly they seem to have a very different take on metaphysical questions. They seemed to use \"atheism\" as \"non theism\", were somewhat condescending towards me once I told them I was agnostic, used terms like \"agnostic atheism\", ... It worried me because they seemed to regard the philosophical/metaphysical side of the question as worthless and self-evident, and they talked about a Sam Harris who (now that I googled a little) seems to be proponent of what looks awfully close to scientism. I searched on the internet and it seems like that take on atheism is indeed very popular. I know that thinkers like B.Russell used the same terminology than I did so my guess is that it's a rather recent phenomenon. My questions are: Is it as widespread as it seems to be on websites (like this one) among \"secular circles\" in English-speaking countries?

What keeps going through my mind now is one of the opening lines from The Lion King.  \"From the moment we arrive on the planet, and blinking step into the sun, there is more to be seen than can ever be seen, more to do than can ever be done.\"  So my question to atheists is this: Does it ever sadden you that there are things you will never get done over the course of your lifetime?  For me, I think about the technological wonders I will miss out on in years to come.  In a hundred years people may be living on Mars, and visiting the methane lakes on Triton.  Mysteries concerning the deepest parts of our own oceans may be solved.  There is so much knowledge and discovery yet to be made, and I won't be here to see it.  What are some other atheists' fondest wishes, and how do they cope with knowing those wishes will never come to pass for them?",

His style and his aggressiveness put into perspective my \"beliefs\" and how ridiculous they were. How freely he talks about it was great. \n\nSo by that time I was 15 and I put christian in quotations because I never really cared for church, or god, or jesus and the whole religion thing. I just said I'll become religious when I'm older because that's what everyone does. No one really tries or wants to follow the bible and the shit rules, the shit writing ,and the shit control they have on society.\n\nIn 10(10-20) years I've set foot in a church twice and zero times in the past 4+ years. By the time I was a sophomore in HS I was at the vague god stage of becoming an atheist. I'm sure most atheist have gone down the theist or deist route and eventually came to atheism. Watching TJ was the sledgehammer that broke through and I just realized I was an atheist and probably have been for some time by then. \n\nHaving friends that are too atheist since then have helped. Two of my best friends are a Ukrainian atheist and a catholic atheist. Catholic as in he was confirmed but conversations throughout the years he's admitted to being an atheist. Even acquaintances and regular friends I found were atheist. My journey was complete. Now at 20 I've been an atheist for at least four years. My love for science and history were also integral to my being today.\n\nSo maybe it is a combination. Not every atheist or not like science. Maybe the person came through the emotional route. Maybe it's a mix of sledgehammer and chisel.",

        "text": "Hi /r/trueatheism,\n\nI've been debating/discussing Christianity with a friend for a while now, which has resulted in him questioning, or at least re-examining, his beliefs. Tomorrow, he's attending a Christian Apologetic conference and is planning to ask some of the \"harder\" questions to John Lennox, in the hope of getting some good answers.\n\n\nSo far, he's planning to ask him exactly how Lennox came to the conclusion that, out of all available religions, Christianity is the true one. This question stems back to the fact that my friend is coming to realize that very few believers actually approach this question the \"correct\" way, i.e. through examining the available evidence and religious claims, but instead end up  conveniently believing the same religion they happened to be brought up in. I think it's a good question, and the answer will be telling.\n\n\nNow, he's also asked me to submit a question for him to ask, which is why I am asking for your input. My friend and I have been focusing quite a bit on early NT scholarship and how (in my view) lackluster the historical evidence really is for the events depicted in the new testament. As such, I'm planning to ask him about the evidence for Jesus' resurrection. \n\n\nSomething along the lines of: ~~\"I think it's fair to say that many Christians consider the resurrection of Jesus to be a fundamental to the faith. Considering that the gospels differ on when the resurrection occurred, who went to the tomb (only Mary Magdalene is there in all gospels) and who was there to receive them, why do you think it is more reasonable to conclude that it did occur, rather than not? What's more, there are no extrabiblical accounts of the resurrection, and John 20 (wherein Simon and Peter arrive at the tomb to find the burial cloth of Jesus still there but not the body) is now considered a late addition and thus, not original.~~\" Obviously it would need to be shortened down and made more succinct, but that's the jist of it, anyway. \n\nWhat do you think of our questions, and what would you have him ask if given the chance?\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n1) What would you ask John Lennox if you had the chance?\n2) What do you think about these two questions:\n\n* How did John Lennox reach his conclusion that Christianity, out of all religions, was the true one?\n\n* Considering the amount of inconsistencies in the NT narrative of the resurrection, and lack of extra-biblical accounts, why do you find it is more reasonable to conclude that the resurrection occurred?\n\n**EDIT**: Rephrased the question a tad:\n&gt;You've been quoted as saying that Christianity is an evidence-based faith. The resurrection narrative of the gospels differ on the time of the resurrection, on who visited the tomb as well on who was waiting at the tomb to name but a few. What's more, there are no extra-biblical mentions or references of the resurrection, and parts of the resurrection narrative (specifically, Simon and Peter finding the linen wrappings, John 20:3-7) are now believed to be later additions, not originally in the bible. These things considered, I struggle with the concept that this is sufficient \"evidence\" for the resurrection. My question to you is this: how did you come to the conclusion, based on the available evidence, that the resurrection occurred?\n",

        "text": "http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/all-scientists-should-be-militant-atheists\n\nLawrence Krauss brings up some interesting points here. I certainly do think that religion and science on the basis of how worldview aren't really compatible on an intellectual level.\n\n&gt;The Kim Davis story raises a basic question: To what extent should we allow people to break the law if their religious views are in conflict with it? It’s possible to take that question to an extreme that even Senator Paul might find absurd: imagine, for example, a jihadist whose interpretation of the Koran suggested that he should be allowed to behead infidels and apostates. Should he be allowed to break the law? Or—to consider a less extreme case—imagine an Islamic-fundamentalist county clerk who would not let unmarried men and women enter the courthouse together, or grant marriage licenses to unveiled women. For Rand Paul, what separates these cases from Kim Davis’s? The biggest difference, I suspect, is that Senator Paul agrees with Kim Davis’s religious views but disagrees with those of the hypothetical Islamic fundamentalist.\n\nThis part I agree with. Certainly people will tend to agree with \"religious freedoms\" that coincide with their own personal beliefs. I do feel like the line should be drawn where religious freedom will affect the lives of other people. I don't really care if Muslims themselves don't want to eat pork, but when they have businesses discriminating against other people I feel like the limit should end there.\n\n&gt;Because science holds that no idea is sacred, it’s inevitable that it draws people away from religion. The more we learn about the workings of the universe, the more purposeless it seems. Scientists have an obligation not to lie about the natural world. Even so, to avoid offense, they sometimes misleadingly imply that today’s discoveries exist in easy harmony with preëxisting religious doctrines, or remain silent rather than pointing out contradictions between science and religious doctrine. It’s a strange inconsistency, since scientists often happily disagree with other kinds of beliefs. Astronomers have no problem ridiculing the claims of astrologists, even though a significant fraction of the public believes these claims. Doctors have no problem condemning the actions of anti-vaccine activists who endanger children. And yet, for reasons of decorum, many scientists worry that ridiculing certain religious claims alienates the public from science. When they do so, they are being condescending at best and hypocritical at worst.\n\nIn other way, I think you could say people in general should live with a skeptical outlook in their life and not let anything escape their scope of scrutiny. Although he doesn't touch on this, within the academia there are their own issues with politics and such, but that's an entirely different issue which imo requires it's own focus and article covering it.\n\n&gt;My practice as a scientist is atheistic,” the biologist J.B.S. Haldane wrote, in 1934. “That is to say, when I set up an experiment I assume that no god, angel, or devil is going to interfere with its course and this assumption has been justified by such success as I have achieved in my professional career.” It’s ironic, really, that so many people are fixated on the relationship between science and religion: basically, there isn’t one. \n\nCould he alternatively suggest being irreligious rather than militant atheist and attain the same conclusion? \nI am curious as to what you all feel about this.",

It is often described as a feeling of deep peace, awe, and just feeling *alive*.\n\nI think this feeling is something that we all can feel and most have felt in some point of their life. People who aren't religious just don't think it has anything to do with god and don't notice it. This is mostly becouse when religious people feel it, the emotion comes when they are praying and there is no noticeable external activity that would explain that feeling to them. When people who arent religious get it it is usually brought on by some external activity. \n\nHave you ever felt *awe* when you have seen a beatiful sunset or anything so beatiful that your mind just stops and all you can do is watch it. For a brief moment there is peace. The mind rests.\n\nYou may know what I am talking about if you  are into extreme sports like climbing, skydiving, surfing etc. which puts you totally in the present becouse the sheer experience is so different that the mind cant think of anything else than what is happening *now*\n\n\nBasically what it is, is giving your attention to something so fully that there is nothing else than this moment. \"Being in the *Zone*\"\n\nMost psychedelic drugs also have a high possibility of doing this. Sometimes to such extremes that most arent ready. \n\nThis feeling has nothing to do with any gods since it comes from the human itself. Most people just think that only by *doing something* it is possible to get that feeling. That is why people are always looking forward to the next thing that lifts them up. Something to distract the mind.\n\nBut we already know that the human is capable of doing this without any external simulation. \n\nEven if it is \"just\" a chemical reaction that happens in the brain makes no difference. It only proves that the chemicals are already there, ready to be used. The only thing that is missing is the signal to release them. \n\nDon't think the signal needs to come outside of you.",

The latter means that a great many people will be duped by an ultimately selfish leader, but said selfishness means that their moral code is ultimately governed by market forces, even if it's based around exploiting them.

Anyways, the video is \"divided\" in three parts, and here's a TL;DW:\n\n1. You can't wait an infinite amount of time for something to happen. Therefore, the universe must have had an origin, it is impossible for it to have existed forever.\n1. Cosmological argument.\n1. \"How does the Cosmological argument prove the Christian God\", you say? Well, the God that gave you morality is moral himself! That's the Christian God! 100% not bullshit!\n\n2 and 3 are really easy to debunk. What bothers me is 1. We're arguing with formal logic, so let's ignore the evidence for a Big Bang. I think that logically speaking, it isn't impossible for the universe to have existed forever. I just do not hold that claim, but it could be. I gave my uncle the example of the real number line: it has no beginning, it has no end, yet it is possible for a number to \"exist\". The number 7 would be reached at some point of the line. Similarly, the Earth would be \"reached\" at some point of the time line, even if such line had no beginning.\n\nHowever, I don't feel confident about my explanation. His response was the following:\n\n\"It is impossible to wait an infinite amount of time for something to happen\" is a proposition with this structure: P -&gt; C. If P -&gt; C, then not C -&gt; not P (modus tollens). Therefore \"If something has happened, then an infinite amount of time hasn't passed\" is a valid conclusion. That means that the universe must have had an origin. \n\nI know that arguing this is a bit pointless, because the Big Bang could easily be the origin of the universe, but I find this question interesting. Logically speaking, that means, ignoring all the evidence, is it impossible for the universe to have existed forever? Does it must have had necessarily a beginning?\n\nWhat do you think?",

        "text": "I figured that I should read more philosophy and theology, and I keep hearing about good Aquinas is so I figured I would at least watch a video that summarized what he is famous for. After listening to his five proofs, I am not impressed. I mean, he seems very intelligent, the way he uses Aristotle's metaphysics interest me, and I understand why he is in the history books. I just don't think his proofs hold water today. Do people actually still use his proof in debates? They don't seem sound. How he gets to certain points confuse me. It seems that some of his proofs are just an argument from ignorance. I plan on reading his work to get a better understanding of it, but based on what I know, this would not sway me to theism. \n\nEdit: just came form the library and checked out a few books:\n\nBasic Logic: The fundamental Principles of formal deductive reasoning by Raymond J. McCall\n\nAristotle's Metaphysics (I guessing it has his complete writings, given all of the books in there)\n\nand Thomas Aquinas: Selected Writings\n\nI have a bit of reading ahead of me. But from what I have seen in this thread and other place, Aquinas five ways usually isn't summarized well and if I don't understand metaphysics, you can't understand Aquinas since his work is based on that. I might make another post once I have a fully formed opinion of his work.",

        "text": "Apostolic Pentecostals interpret the 11th chapter of Corinthians to indicate that women should never cut their hair.  \n\nKim Davis, (the Kentucky marriage licensing clerk), has been all over the news lately, for refusing to sign on paperwork for same-sex couples.  You may have noticed her general appearance exudes her religious affiliation.  Davis has unusually long hair,  appears to wear ankle-length dress, and never appears in makeup.    Many people have incorrectly assumed that she is Amish.  It  is more likely that Davis is **Apostolic Pentecostal.**   \n\nVarious Pentecostal sects in the United States, for example the UPC  (United Pentecostal Church) place restrictions on women's clothing, their hair, and use of makeup \n\nThe prohibition on hair-cutting stems from an interpretation of 1st Corinthians, chapter 11, starting at verse 3 : \n\n&gt; But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God. Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head. But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven. For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered. For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man. For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man. Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man. For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels. Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord. For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of God.\nJudge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered? Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him? But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering. But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.\n\n\nWikipedia article on the UPC :\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Pentecostal_Church_International",

I go on. Next to go is the illusion of centrality. Before Darwin, one could believe that human beings were distinct from other life-forms, chips off the old divine block. No more.\"*\n\nI don't think it's appropriate for Barash to teach these kinds of theological/philosophical claims in a science class.\n\nLet me address one potential misunderstanding. I'm not taking the position that \"evolution is just a religion\" which one sometimes hears Christians take.\n\nRather, I'm making the following distinction:\n\nThe claim that humans share a common ancestor with all other forms of life is a scientific one.\n\nThe claim that *\"Before Darwin, one could believe that human beings were distinct from other life-forms, chips off the old divine block. No more.\"* is a philosophical or theological one.\n\n\n\nWhat are the thoughts of people on this sub? Do any of you support Barash teaching the content he does?\n\nHere’s a thought experiment: take some of the statements put forward by people like Barash and ask whether you would allow the negations of those premises to be taught in a public classroom. That is, biology professor X takes some idea from the natural sciences and teaches his classroom that, in light of this idea, it’s just not tenable to maintain that humans **aren’t** radically different from other forms of life and **aren’t** \"a chip of the old divine block\".\n\nI'm a ~~grill ;)~~ Christian and a YEC btw.\n\nEDIT: A big thank you to everybody for not mindlessly downvoting my comments to invisibility.

It seems that this apologetic, \"Atheists don't exist.\" doesn't even allow for that position. \n\nWhat do you think about being told that you do not exist?

Like, you were about to watch a movie with a cool trailer, or play a super hyped up game, or even opened a present only to be disappointed with what the contents were?\n\nIt seems like our imagination of something is often better than reality. Not just in the sense that you thought the present was a new Xbox but turned out to be a pack of socks, but also in the sense that...you don't know WHAT to expect. Like a haunted house, you hear screams but you have never been inside. And there is no way of knowing what to expect other than scary things. So, your imagination just assumes something great without manifesting that great thing into real stuff. \n\nI see this a lot of time with theists. What god \"is\" or what heaven/afterlife \"is\" is often so incomprehensible that you cannot possibly imagine the sweet ass awesomeness that is god/afterlife. I often times though, find myself being able to manifest it as something. Person says god exists. Okay, where? he is beyond our world. So, like he's in space? No beyond that. So, another dimension. No, its just beyond. \n\nOr \"God is all around us.\" So, like air? No, you can't touch or see him. So, is he atoms? or subatomic particles? No, its outside our natural world. rinse wash repeat. \n\nWhat I often find is that this imaginative state that god/afterlife is always in hypes people into believing it, and once you start to \"define\" god, all the glory fades. And you are left with something that sounds crazy, or is at the very least disappointing. And so people try very hard to be as vague and abstract as humanly possible. They make up definitions for him that are so beyond anything at all that you might as well say they believe in nothing. Its like wtf are you calling god? A lot of people take religious texts and sort of invent what god is out of them. Christians for instance  have direct examples of god as an anthropomorphic being in the book of Genesis, yet they assert that god is not natural. It is \"beyond\" or whatever. Because the idea of god as existing as a being can often be described in ways that just sounds dumb to even the strongest apologetic or at the least disappointing. And so people choose  not to open their presents. The fairy tale is better than the possibility that it is not an Xbox. ",

A couple of them have turned into wart-like sores that bleed. My sisters and I feel pretty sure that they are squamous cell carcinoma. We reached out to our dad (who is non-religious) and asked if he'd talked to her about it. He had, a while ago, and her response was \"You knew what you were getting into when you married me.\" Well, we are extremely distraught over this, and feel like we did not get to make that choice. She chose to have us, and we feel like her willful ignorance and avoidance of getting medical treatment is very selfish. She's been seeing a Christian Science practitioner for years about it, and it has obviously not improved. We've been drafting an email that we're planning to send tonight, expressing how worried we are, that we've respected her method of dealing with this for years and haven't seen improvement, and begging her not to willfully abandon us.\n\nThis is definitely one of the most difficult experiences of my life so far; it's so utterly mindblowing that we have to intervene to beg her to get medical care. I don't know how my family will be able to cope with losing her, over something so preventable.\n\nHas anyone here had to confront a family member about their refusal to seek medical care for religious reasons? Were you successful? How did you approach it? I'm desperate to save my mom's life. Thanks for listening.\n\n\nEDIT: good news! she responded positively to our email, and agreed to see a doctor. it was very clear in her response that she's doing some mental gymnastics justifying the \"fear\" she's felt as being our fear, not hers, which is such a typical CS response. but who cares, we're taking a step in the right direction!\n\nthanks for all your replies. those of you who haven't heard of Christian Science, it is a denomination founded in the late 1800s by Mary Baker Eddy, which tells followers that they too can heal the sick like Jesus did, and that Jesus didn't \"die for our sins\", he \"died\" (and resurrected) to show us that life is eternal. They basically deny that they are material beings, but rather spiritual beings, and that any illness or trouble they encounter is an illusion (\"error\") that just needs to be seen as what it is - untrue. i remember being told the acronym for \"FEAR\": False Evidence Appearing Real. basically my mom sees going to the doctor as treating a spiritual problem with a material solution, thereby acknowledging the reality of the material world. this post from /u/infidrell (https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/3is0za/confronting_my_christian_science_mom_about_skin/cuj9wj3) is a good explanation.",

The practice of polytheism is equated with the Islamic doctrine of *shirk*.  The Quran holds that there is no greater crime than shirk.  It is the only crime that Allah will not forgive after death (Quran 4:48).  Further, verse 9:1-15 equates those who commit *shirk* with enemies of Islam.  \n\nTaken together, this means that by practicing their own (albeit questionable) doctrine, the vast majority of Christians are committing the worst sin imaginable and can be equated with enemies of Islam.  It's not just any doctrine either--it's the ***core doctrine of most forms of Christianity.***  \n\nYou will also note that few in that thread are sold on the argument that the Trinity doctrine is not polytheistic.  I would have to agree there, having studied the concept quite extensively in high school and uni religion courses.  But it appears to be a widespread theological assumption in Muslim circles that the Trinity doctrine is in fact polytheism and, as such, Christians are committing *shirk*.  \n\nI will leave you with this quote from the linked thread:\n\n&gt; Just something relevant in the Quran (9:30-31):\nAnd the Jews say: 'Uzair (Ezra) is the son of Allah, and the Christians say: Messiah is the son of Allah. That is a saying from their mouths. They imitate the saying of the disbelievers of old. Allah's Curse be on them, how they are deluded away from the truth!\nThey (Jews and Christians) took their rabbis and their monks to be their lords besides Allah (by obeying them in things which they made lawful or unlawful according to their own desires without being ordered by Allah), and (they also took as their Lord) Messiah, son of Maryam (Mary), while they (Jews and Christians) were commanded [in the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)) to worship none but One Ilah (God - Allah) La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He). Praise and glory be to Him, (far above is He) from having the partners they associate (with Him).\"",

These are the people we grew up with and still love and respect them. Disagreements eventually arise, but things can always cool down and all is forgiven.\n\nIn my particular case, atheism also extends to other forms of skepticism. Facebook is full of \"Forwards From Grandma\" type stories, urban legends, anonymous confessions, and self-righteous \"I'm better than you\" type misused memes. Its easy enough to dismiss these are harmless stupidity, but sometimes an important social issue is bought up. My friends/family will resort to emotional pleading arguments and hysterics to prove their case. I can often Google a research-backed refutation.\n\nAnd this is where the problems start; they think I'm trolling. And I mean they tell me they feel I am angry, or somehow sitting behind a keyboard snarling with delight that I burst their bubble. And quite the opposite. I never make personal attacks, stay on topic and always find some kind of fact of back up my point. No matter how civil I remain, they just blow up.\n\nNow I know you only have my side of the issue and of course I'd paint myself in the most innocent light, but I do try hard to make sure I don't yell, curse, or share unfounded opinions. I am also sure to make sure its not constant mythbusting and debunking. I celebrate my friends and family's triumphs, buy stuff from their stupid online stores, buy their books, pat their spouses on the back and remain civil, but it does not seem to add up. I'll call bullshit on some racist Facebook post making the rounds and suddenly I'm the devil incarnate.\n\nDoes this happen to you? Am I a dick, or are they dicks?\n\nP.S.

What do you think?\n\nI have three major goals in this site which will probably manifest in three literal sections of the site. The first is explaining the Philosophy of Science, the second is explanation and resource base for learning about evolutionary biology, and the third is a feature of cosmology and philosophical display of how incredible the cosmos is without deism or prior assumptions. You could say this is a professional attempt to echo a television series like COSMOS, but on a much more detailed and social level.\n\nI intend to incorporate some form of social debate system for any topic the site addresses and I currently have no idea how to conceptualize that on a higher level than a comment system.\n\nI could say that the ulterior motive of the site is the reduce the prominence of creationism in America and reduce the reliance of faith as a way of living. If curious, [this essay](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8pWAC-gESxwQkRoTnBQYUVuQTA/view?usp=sharing) is the start of me conceptualizing the Philosophy of Science to someone who has no idea what it is or how useful it is - notably a creationist.\n\nSo my point is if you have any ideas or advice about the development of this site, which could potentially see millions of visitors after it is completed in a year or two, please comment! Or if you happen to read the essay and think I'm flawed somewhere in my perspectives, please let me know so I can develop with the concerns in mind or even change my own views. Thank you.",

The battles of Priestly \nelite guilds is the defining factor of the entirety of \nearly biblical authorship and content. \n\nIt is important to know that Mosaic authorship of \nthe Pentateuch has been imploded over the last\n150 years, starting with Julius Wellhausen, and \nexpounded over time by innumerable other critics \nand researchers to the point where we have a much \nclearer view on the authorship of these ancient Israelite \nwritings, their authors and their audiences. The deeper \nyou dive into these analysis and their refutations, a \nmuch more cogent picture appears.\n\nThe implications stretch further as we delve into the \nderivative belief systems that emanated from Yahwism. \nThat implies coming out of a cave claiming the \"angel Gabriel\" \ngave you divine revelations is problematic at the very least. \n\nOr, Jesus, claiming to be the \"Son of Man\" throughout \nhis earthly career, only to be exalted to \"Son of God\", \n[posthumously]( http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/0061778192/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?qid=1440451781&amp;sr=1-1&amp;pi=AC_SY200_QL40&amp;keywords=how+jesus+became+god&amp;dpPl=1&amp;dpID=41-OHBsbWCL&amp;ref=plSrch\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/0061778192/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?qid=1440451781&amp;sr=1-1&amp;pi=AC_SY200_QL40&amp;keywords=how+jesus+became+god&amp;dpPl=1&amp;dpID=41-OHBsbWCL&amp;ref=plSrch) should\nraise alarm with understanding claims to authority through \nYahweh, the god of Israel.\n\nNow, while the multitude of responsible scholarly consensus \nreflects this historical reality, it makes little headway within \ncultic (religious) circles.

But I assume you are somewhat familiar with the writings and ideas of Sam Harris, thus you could maybe answer on his behalf and clarify for me this point.  \nI've sent him an Email recently about this but he haven't responded. I'm sure he is a busy man and can't possibly answer every single Email he recieves. Therfore I present it to you in hopes of getting an answer:\n\nI'm on of the many who have read your email exchange with professor Chomsky and I have found it quite interesting. To be honest it was the first time that I've been exposed to you and your ideas and it got me quite interested. So I've started doing reading of your work here and there, watching some of your debates and lectures, and they were quite interesting, though I have many reservations. But there is an area(which is relevant to you exchange with Chomsky) which I remain confused about. Giving that I haven't read everything you have ever wrote I don't want to be misunderstanding your views so please correct me whenever I make a mistake.\nI understand that your moral framework that you have presented in your book the moral landscape and elsewere revolves around the concept of \" Maximizing the well-being of conscious creatures\". And you hold some form of Utilitarianism I suppose.\nGiving that moral framework, I  was confused about your whole \"intentions matter\" argument, giving the bombing of Al shifa in contrast to 9/11.\nIn order to not get lost in the geo-political debate giving the enormous complexity of  both incidents I have made a similar analogy, but you can treat it as independent from the actual incidents :\n\nLet's say there is a sadistic killer who kills people for his own pleasure,  he  kill them with the intention to kill. thus reducing the well being of conscious creatures. So in order to stop him the authority  sends a policeman after him. After a long chase the policeman finally has him in a crowded market. He sees the killer but many innocent people are around him aswell. Giving that he does not have a perfect weapon he knows that if he started shooting at him he well kill many of innocent people, yet he choses to ignore this and procceed to shoot at the killer, killing him but many other innocent alongside him, even more than the killer has ever killed.  So both actions have reduced the well being of conscious creatures, the latter probably more drasticllly but both had different intent, so how do you determine that the policeman is a better person based on his intent giving that he killed more people than the killer? Didn't he, with his actions, rrgardles of his intent, reduced the well-being of conscious creatures more?\nIn other words what role do intentions play in this scenario within your moral framework of \"maximizing well being of conscious creatures\"? How can we derive good and bad in this scenario from your moral framework?\n\nIt's worth pointing out that I'm not a native-speaking english\n\nthanks\n",

        "text": "A lot of atheists are baffled by the ridiculous things Christian apologists say. They think that almost all Christian apologists must be deliberately dishonest, since there is no way that someone could actually believe these arguments. In some cases this is probably true, but I think more of that sort of thing is honest than a lot of atheists realize (and I'm an atheist myself).\n\nLet me begin with a concept you're all familiar with: solipsism. (I'm not going to make a presuppositionalist argument, don't worry, I'm an atheist and I'm only bringing this up to explain how Christian apologists think.) Most atheists agree that there is no way to argue with a committed solipsist, it's just this silly logical trick that can't be gotten around but doesn't go anywhere interesting.\n\nTo a committed Christian, atheism looks like solipsism, but this time it's an argument for something that *matters*, something *horrible*. And more and more people are coming across this argument and being persuaded by it.\n\nIf you put yourself in the Christian's shoes for a second, you would do pretty much anything to stop that sort of argument from spreading, wouldn't you? Logical rigor is almost a nicety compared to stopping people from believing this horrible thing that sends them to eternal torture.\n\nSo, the next time you see a Christian arguing that logic depends on God or whatever, try to remember that internet debates don't look the same way to them as they look to you. To them, the internet is a battleground - and souls are at stake. They're just doing their best to defend what they believe.",

To me, Harris is clinging to a weak argument here.  He seems to propose that we all have a gut feeling/common sense of right and wrong when we consider clear examples of \"evil\", i.e. throwing acid in someones face or a universe which maximizes suffering.  Once you grant this minimum level of morality, more robust moral systems can be justified as well.  It is the first part of this argument that I have a problem with, and these problems I think were summed up nicely by the questioner in the video.  I agree that Harris is appealing to common sense, and that his argument is not philosophically robust.  The foundation of his justification of morality is just pointing to the innate reaction most humans have in response to clear suffering, but this is not a strong argument for establishing morality.  If a theist made a similar appeal to justify their beliefs, I think atheists would rightly pounce on their fallacy.  \n\nI also think he may not have been prepared for this question, since his response seemed in large part just a reiteration of his original argument.  So perhaps I just don't understand Harris' actual views.\n\nDo you see where I'm coming from with my issues with Harris here?  Could anyone help clarify or discuss Harris' viewpoint?",

Obviously, I believe that an Atheist-Humanist identity and worldview is the best solution to all of our problems, and in this text I will describe, 1) Who we are not, 2) Who we are, 3) The challenges we face, and 4) How we will succeed (all in 10 pages!).\n\nI believe that humanity basically suffers from a false identity problem. Our false identity stems from our allegiance to social groups such as nationalism, religion, language, social class, materialism, political affiliation, age, etc. All of these social groups divide us, when in fact we are a single unit, species, and entity. I believe that a true Atheist-Humanist worldview places our shared humanity at the forefront, empowers us to take charge of our own communal destiny, and encourages us to shift our perspective of life from the local to the global.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI would love any and all feedback! I would be honoured if you would share this document with others.\n\nIf the file sharing format doesn't work/ could be better, please let me know.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts and suggestions,\n\nDan",
