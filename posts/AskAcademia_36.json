How can I do the massive amount of homework from my honours classes, have a internship, have a job, and be in key club? It doesn't have to be all at once, maybe in the summer I can have an internship but during school time I can get a job, but key club also hurts my schedule. Should I even be worried about economics so early in the Game right now? I'm only a freshman but the earlier I can earn and save, the less stressful college will be.",

        "text": "I don't know if this is the correct subreddit to ask for advice on this, but I feel you will probably understand me well and so can give me your point of view. \n\nI have an excellent CV in biomedicine: great grades during my grade, two academic master's degrees focused on research and neuroscience and roughly 4 years experience at taking care of my own project in the lab. I have always been convinced to perform a PhD but after nearly 2 years trying to settle down on a final lab to conduct my thesis I am again without a lab/scholarship supporting me at the financial level (I didn't want to stay in my first lab and even though I wish I could have stayed at my second one they didn't have enough money nor been big enough to ask for grants for me). \n\nI have been waiting for an opportunity for like 6 months now and two good labs are very interested in me to conduct their projects. Nevertheless, none of them has been able to provide me with the guarantee that they would be able to support me at the economic level. All I do is waiting for grant resolutions that take months to resolve. On top of that, both labs understand my position but want me to decide and try for one of them this September. I quite prefer one of them, although it would mean moving from my current city. However I want to be sure I will be starting my PhD this year, so I don't want to lose my second option either (which I also like).\n\nOn the other hand, my always present confidence in performing a PhD is now fainting and I am starting to want to move to the pharma industry. I know it is not an easy road, but for me, even the entry to the program is being a nightmare. The superlow salary / hours done ratio is less ok with me as the years go by. And all the things I have seen as how the science works during this time, especially its instability, have made me decide that I probably will not be wanting to be on academia after my PhD (if I finally can do it). For all of this, I have been thinking in applying for a masters degree (a professional one this time) which could open me the gates to the pharma industry (as clinical assays' supervisor, medical affair, MSL, marketing...), thus renouncing to these PhD opportunities I may have now. \n\nI have been working hard for my future my whole life, but I am in a situation where I find myself as lost as if I had to choose again my career. Have you ever been in a situation like that? Having a PhD does compensate all the difficulties am I going through now? \n\nThank you for your time reading this and your comment (if you have one!). \n\nTLDR: I have always wanted a PhD on neuroscience, but even though I have a great CV, starting one is becoming extra difficult for me (2 years delayed on it). I may have two PhD options on the table, although none of them is guaranteeing me financial support yet. Nevertheless, I am starting to think to move to the pharmaceutical industry and start a master's degree that could open me those gates and thus forget the PhD. ",

        "text": "I'm very worried about my students. I'm a teaching assistant (biochemistry graduate student, I actually attend a university nearby but I was able to commute 1 day a week to TA for the lab to satisfy my teaching requirements) for an advanced lab course at a liberal arts college. The students in the course are all at least juniors, some seniors. They are all fairly smart, too. However, the majority of them could not do basic things, such as making an aqueous solution of a single substance, they had difficulty following the procedure. They've had at minimum 3, usually 4 or 5 Chemistry courses, with labs, and do not have very basic skills that a chemist should have. \n\nThe professor insists that there is no problem, and just marches forward, fixing problems or having other students or TAs do the work for them. For General Chemistry and Organic, TAs made all the solutions, and they were given a step by step guide to complete the lab. That seems like quite the missed opportunity. I know why they do it, for time, but in my head, a few good, well understood, solid labs is much more beneficial than a bunch of skimpy, barely-done or understood labs. I don't get it. I believe the professor, but I'm worried and rather than bug him again I thought I'd ask reddit for help. Reddit, please help me help these students. \n\nMost of the students, including several straight A 3rd year chemistry majors that have passed both organic chemistry semesters, and a semester of biochem with an A, don't know how to make a solution or follow simple instructions on a procedure that almost, but not quite, gives you a step by step process to do the lab. I believe they understand the theory behind it, I hope, but I'm very concerned that teaching has devolved from developing proficiencies of useful skills, into \"teaching for the test\". I will say, they do have the advanced lab courses, which are a 4 hour lab each week for every semester 3rd and 4th year. I think they might develop the skills by that point, hopefully. \n\nFor comparison, I attended the same school and courses they did, and I'm not a genius, but I knew how to make solutions, and do the stuff they needed to do while in high school, or my freshman year, depending on how you count. I suppose I learn conceptually and visually, but not necessarily physically. Some people can need to physically do it or see it done to learn. I get that. \n\nHere are my questions:\n1. Is that a reasonable level of proficiency for a junior? Should I be worried? \n\n2. Is there anything I can do to help the students learn? Talking to the professor, or certain teaching methods? \n\n3. Is there normally a steep learning curve involved in chemistry major laboratory courses? \n\n4. (meta) I welcome any feedback on how I asked this question, as I'm still working on my ettiqute and not using leading questions and such. Comments or PMs are fine by me.",

        "text": "I’m not 100% sure if this belongs here, but figure its worth a shot to see what the knowledge of reddit has to contribute. This is a question in few parts, more-or-less.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst, **I want to approach my college (I'm in the states) about doing a semester abroad in the spring semester of my senior year**. I am currently in my junior year. The thing is, I've already done a semester abroad, in the same place I want to go back to. I plan on going to talk to the study abroad people in the next couple weeks to put things in motion, but I'm unsure how to broach the topic.\n\nMy college has fairly structured study abroad programmes, generally speaking. There is always a program director (a glorified professor who travels with the students abroad) and lots of group activities (weekend excursions, director-lead classes, etc.). Similarly, the college handles everything financially--the student pays the college and the college sorts out things like flights, accommodation, enrolment, etc. So my main sticking point is trying to make the higher-ups understand that I want to study abroad, sort of through the college programme, but not really. I guess the best way to put it is that, **ideally, I would financially go through my college, since they have a good working relationship with the host university abroad, and be in contact with the director in case something dire happens, but otherwise do everything on my own** (e.g., none of the programme-related courses, excursions, group stuff, etc.). I am more than willing to bypass my college and apply to the host university directly as an independent international student, but 1) I'm not sure how that would affect my status as a full-time student at my college (see below for graduation concerns) and 2) I figure it would be easier to work with my college since they've been working with the host university for a while.\n\nAll that goes to say, **I would greatly appreciate any advice/input/suggestions on how to begin talks with the study abroad office and how I could explain things to them**. I don't want to come in and have them think that I basically just want the exact same semester abroad all over again--I don't, and I really want to remain as separate as possible from the actual programme group. But I also don't want to sound like some student who's gone rogue and is breaking all of the college protocols. I want to show them that I really, really want this, and I'll work as hard as I need to to make it happen. I'll pay whatever, I'll get all my on-campus requirements done, I'll be the most responsible and studious student they ever saw. \n\nSecondly, but still related, **is it wise for me to study abroad the last half of my senior year?** I know several people who have studied abroad their senior year at my college and not had any issues (still graduated and all that), but they were all basically finished with their degrees already/were just tying up lose ends with core curriculum stuff. My position is a little more delicate because I am double-majoring. I know I can finish up all the requirements for one of my majors in these next three semesters, but I would be finishing my other major while abroad. **Would this cause me problems in terms of graduating on time?** I'm not 100% sure how it works, but I know that my college waits until after courses abroad have been concluded, gets the transcript from the host university, and then credits the courses to the student. Another thing--courses taken directly through the host university don't get factored into our GPA; the grade is thrown out and all they care about is if you took the course and passed. I'm prepared for my advisor to balk at this a bit, but I'm hopeful that he would accept it/we could work it out with the registrar so the grades do matter, since it will be to finish off the higher portions of my degree. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:** \n\n**1) How to ask about studying abroad when I've already done study abroad in the same place?**\n\n**2) Will studying abroad my last semester of college prevent a timely graduation?**",

Sometimes it's minor things that make the paper a little difficult to read, but sometimes I have trouble even understanding the author's point because the language is too garbled. The journal specifically tells authors and reviewers that there is no copy-editor - either the author copy-edits, or the reviewers do. I'm happy to peer review papers for content, but it's an enormous time-sink for me to copy-edit a poorly-written paper on top of that (not to mention that I don't know exactly what the author is trying to say). \n\nI don't want to send a poorly-written paper along for publishing, but I feel kind of responsible if the journal has no copy-editing process. Usually I'll bounce the paper back and suggest they hire a native speaker to copy-edit, but I don't want to be an asshole if that's actually my job as a reviewer. I also don't want to be keeping non-native English speakers from publishing. How much copy-editing is expected from reviewers? (I'm in the biological sciences). Thanks!",

Obviously, I can't do this if I don't purchase the book/rent from a library. I'm sure I'm not the only person who has this habit. Similarly, it's easy for me to find key points when I highlight them, since I can just skim the book with my thumb and easily find the passages I highlighted.\n\nThe only method I can think of to track key points is: take a picture of the paragraph on my phone, or type the main points (Both of these seem time consuming and hard to organize... and if I only type the page number, I won't have any idea what it's referencing, and there will be a ton of page numbers).\n\nIs this just something I need to get used to? Do researchers typically rent books from a library when doing research, or do they purchase their books? Is there any way for a researcher to get a discount on books? Any suggestions on how to track key points would be greatly appreciated.\n\n​\n\nP.S.

I don't know if that breaks any rules, but here goes.\n\nI've just finished my master's degree in the UK in a hard science. I have a French girlfriend who has moved back to Paris to do her master's until June 2020. I really want to be close to her, but between my inability to speak a huge amount of French and *wonderful* French bureaucracy I have been unable to find any position for a PhD or job in Paris. However, I have an offer in a lab in the North of France to do a PhD, roughly an hour away from Paris by train, so I could see her every weekend. The subject is well suited to my skillset and by all accounts it's a good lab, although I have not visited it, or even talked to the supervisor via anything but email. Truthfully, I would not be applying for the position had my girlfriend not been in close proximity. I doubt I'd even be applying for PhD's, as I don't see myself in research. Despite all this I did enjoy my master's research and was quite good at it, I felt. This makes me think that I could do this PhD successfully and finish after 3 years. If the position was in the UK I would have accepted by now, but doing it in a foreign country where I do not speak the language, on my own, terrifies me. \n\nI'm torn between saying fuck it and giving it a go, but knowing that if I don't enjoy it I can just drop out, or knocking it on the head and trying to get something in Paris, or even being a mature adult and getting a job here in the UK and being patient until June 2020, and deciding from there, whilst learning French. I don't want much from life, just enough that I have a roof over my head and enough that I don't have to worry about money problems. I'm not hell-bent on making my millions working myself to death.

Yet, I'd contend that the project would significantly advance knowledge through the creation of new tooling, the sharing of methods and techniques used to attack a given system, and even subsequent efforts to patch a vulnerability.

        "text": "Apologies if this question doesn’t belong here, but I think my concerns essentially boil down to: Given my field and interests, is further grad school a wise decision for me to make? And how do I even figure out the answer to that question?\n\nI’ve had an odd although not unheard of experience with my master’s, which is in a branch of psychology dealing with animal cognition. My research interests are the academic side of animal behavior, essentially modern ethology. I managed to land a position in the lab of a PI who is a big name, but an abysmal and toxic advisor (and at this point a joke of a scientist). My cohort is like a beleaguered crew of shipwreck survivors. After 6 (!!!) years—which, oddly enough, seems to be not unheard of at the master’s level in my field—I am hopefully about to defend a thesis based on research that I performed myself without any supervision from my advisor at all. In fact, his dementia at this point is such that I will probably have an easier time getting out of this program if I can somehow gaslight him into not bothering to read my paper at all. I have an official second reader and unofficial third reader who have been complete godsends, and both seem to understand the difficulty of my position and maintain that my work is commendable. For context, two of the years out of the last six were spent pursuing a project, at the behest of my advisor, that required me to move cities, and ultimately turned out to be utterly impossible to execute. My advisor is now asking a poor PhD student to take on this project, god help her. In the years since, I managed to devise a study that I believe is an interesting contribution to the literature, execute it without help or supervision from anyone at all, and have attained my advisors insane request that my thesis be around 100 pages long. I will get this degree if it kills me. It nearly has. If my advisor dies before I get it I will wrest it from his cold, dead hands. \n\nAll that rant to say: This process nearly killed my passion for my subject, but I still truly love what we study. I now find myself way behind where I would have liked to be at this point in my life and approaching a crossroads. If anyone could give me advisement, I would appreciate it. I have seen, luckily early on I guess, what an abusive hellhole the academic world can be. And I want to be realistic about the opportunities an eventual PhD might afford me—given the current job market, not much. My current expertise is in the documentation of a specific aspect of the social behavior of an intelligent mammal. I would like to spend my life invested in similar fields: Evolutionary biology, comparative social behavior, ecology, etc.\n\nMy question is: What can I do now to investigate what opportunities I have in academia or industry? How do I figure out what jobs I might qualify for now? How do I determine whether a PhD is the right move? I have an extensive professional network but I have not maintained these connections well, I suspect I can cold call. What should I invest in, at this point? Should I pursue unpaid internships (puke, but ok)? Should I go to more conferences? Should I draft future research plans? How do I figure out whether I will ever be able to realistically support myself in this field, and/or what skills I can develop to progress? I now live far away from my degree-granting institution in the low-COL city where I performed my research. I have developed a low-commitment food service career to pay my bills for the time being. So I’m secure for now and have a lot of potential flexibility in terms of how to proceed. But the most obvious option—continue on for a PhD with my advisor—is not a possibility for me. \n\nSorry for this long post, and thank you SO MUCH to anyone who can help me! After all this, I would really like to steer my life in a successful direction. Thank you!",

There is no indication the abuse is still happening, it does not involve the institution, and the student did not ask for help--simply recounted a biographical fact in (presumed) confidence.\n\nMy professor asked me whether she must report this student's case to our Title IX officer. Must she?\n\nMy concern is that the intent of Title IX is to protect students. But if the professor reports without permission as a CYA, will that really help the student? Or imagine I ask the professor to go back and ask the student for permission, and the student refuses--must the professor STILL report? ",

        "text": "Hi folks,\n\nI'm basically looking for thoughts, suggestions, opinions, etc about obtaining a PhD as a 40 yr old with a full-time job and 3 kids.  \nBACKGROUND\n\nI worked in industry for almost a decade and found a great gig as an adjunct teaching in my field. I loved it, and was eventually offered a full-time job teaching and I gladly took it. I have a Master's Degree in my field, I had never thought about a PhD mainly because I didn't really know what it was. No one in my family has a PhD, I don't think I even knew anyone (aside from professors) who had or talked about a PhD, so now I'm finding myself immersed in a sea of PhDs and I have a few questions.\n\nNEED?\n\nI don't think I NEED a PhD to continue what I'm doing. I teach in the field of Communication, I work with students assisting them with Undergraduate Research in their areas of study, I've spoken at conferences and I plan to continue doing all of that. Even my colleagues suggest that I don't NEED to get a PhD to remain successful as an Instructor at my institution. I'm okay with that...but I may WANT a PhD...that's what I'm toying with.\n\nCOST\n\nIf I started saving, I could possibly \"afford\" to get a PhD by the time I'm 70. Okay, maybe sooner, or even maybe I could never afford it. I'm already deep in student loan debt from my Master's degree and with 3 kids I just don't see myself being able to add the cost of getting a PhD to our budget anytime soon or ever.\n\nMy colleagues have told me that many of them didn't pay for their PhDs because they taught at their institutions, but they were basically income-less and relied on their significant others' income to actually survive. Are there any other ways that PhDs can be affordable? Anyone have any tricks up their sleeves?\n\nWANT\n\nI guess that's it. I know that I don't NEED a PhD, I'm actually quite valued here (even as a lowly \"instructor\"), but the stories of my colleagues who have obtained their PhDs are very positive, and their experiences have allowed them to develop relationships and create opportunities for them in the academic world.\n\nAnyone have any thoughts for a broke middle-aged dude teaching at University who is wondering how the heck to even THINK about obtaining a PhD?   \n",

        "text": "Hello r/AskAcademia\n\n​\n\nI am a 2nd year PhD student.  Before I started my PhD, I participated in several projects (not exactly related to my current topic, but there are some aspects in common, let's say that both of them fit nicely under Biology/Ecology), and because of that I became co-author in about 5 of these plus two other where I am co-first-author (my name appears in second place, although there's an asterisk indicating that the first two authors contributed equally to the work). But now that I am soon submitting my first article of the PhD, I am thinking in going by another name.\n\nI have two \"last\" names, one from my mother, and one from my father. I have used my father's name in all publications so far, but it is a rather common name: in researchgate, for instance, I keep receiving \"is this article yours?\" suggestions all the time; in a conference I attended there was someone else with the same name as mine. My mom's name is exactly the contrary: I would be the only person in the world publishing under that name. Plus, I believe it is both easier to memorize and to pronounce in an international context.\n\nI believe that changing my name right now wouldn't be a huge deal. With platforms like ORCID it is possible to associate different names in publications to the same person. Even if there could be some confusion, I believe I would  be mostly judged by the work I have been doing during my PhD rather than before. I have talked to my supervisors and they're fine with anything. My main supervisor suggested using both names and hyphenate, but I think that name would be way too long (both my last names are three-syllabic).\n\n​\n\nWhat do you think? Am I missing something important here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT:\n\nA simple example:\n\nImagine that my official name is Samuel Peanutbutter Smith\n\nBefore starting my graduate studies I've always published under Samuel Smith\n\nNow I want to switch to Samuel Peanutbutter because it's way less common.",
