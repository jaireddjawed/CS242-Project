In fact what has been of actual value to me have been works on linguistics, phonetics, English grammar and works the works of Fussel and Meredith Martin on Poetry, Meter &amp; Form. Then again, my most influential teachers were taught in the new criticism school but regardless I don't really see the value of theory in textual analysis aside from their distinctive value as philosophical texts. Dialogism and the Carnivalesque is a great philosophical theory on the nature of how novels work but if I want a critical reading of Robinson Crusoe, I'm purely concerned with the actual words in the novel and how they relate to one another - how my mind is relating the semiotic elements into \"utterances\" is hardly even a passing thought.

However sometimes the examples philosophers use only go as deep as needed to make a philosophical point so I'd be curious to see if there are any examples that shows how these philosophical systems interact more at the level of specific criticism or historical research. It seems even though some recent Hegelian philosophers that discuss film and art like Zizek and Pippin, from what I've read of them they only touch on arts to reflect more broad philosophical points and don't seem to engage deeply with historical research in these areas for their own sake.\n\nI was wondering if anyone here knows of any art critics, historians, or theorists who are more immersed in the actual discipline as oposed to philosophy that have been influenced by the recent renewed interest in systematic and metaphysical philosophy?  Or since Hegel is trying to systematize the metaphysical philosophical tradition with modern philosophy, are there any historical examples when systematic philosophy was more prevalent influencing art critics, historians or theorists?\n\n(Ideally looking for something in English, I know Hegel had some students who wrote much more detailed art histories and ran art journals, but they're not translated, and I'm not quite comfortable enough in the German language to tackle those yet, but I'd still be curious to know about examples in other languages for future reading.)",

        "text": "Hello, good people.\n\nI'm going to be writing my thesis during this semester, and I thought I'd use every trick I have in my book. One of them is to ask the people in here for a few possible knowledge gems on the subject of my thesis. There's bound to be some people who know way more than me. I'm not yet sure if the subject is really any good and could yield some good theses, but I feel like I have to at least check it out.\n\nI'm interested in the \"walking\" motif. A lot of characters in works of literature are walking and have conscious thoughts about this activity. I'm thinking: What are their motives, what makes them go out to just walk, what do they seek to gain? What happens to these walkers when they are out there, what affects them? (etc.)\n\nI've already done some research, of course. My point of entry to the subject has been partially Walter Benjamin (\"Das Passagenwerk\" and \"One-way street\" that has some interesting (also contradictory things) to say about walking. The former work is famous for its reading of the arcades in Paris and how they affect the visitor who is walking through the halls, while the latter has some things about retracing a person's (or author's) steps/words and even copying them as the best means of true understanding). \n\nSusan Sontag, in her essay about Benjamin, called \"Under the Sign of Saturn\" also mentions Benjamin talking about labyrinths and getting lost in a city as preferable to knowing your way around a city (or something to that effect - I haven't found the work where Benjamin mentions this, but I believe it's in \"Berlin Childhood\" which I will try and procure).\n\nMy initial thoughts has also brushed the fields of \"affect theory\" (since walking is also the entering and exiting of atmospheres), \"theory of place\" (a study of the \"walking\" motif surely has to include a meditation on the place and the subject's position in/relation to it), and some minor thoughts.\n\nAnyway, so my focus has so far been on Benjamin, as you can see, but I am still in a brainstorming phase where I'm trying to amass a good quantity of articles/books/essays/whatever, and I'm open to almost anything that is related to this motif. So, my question: Do you have any reading suggestions related to the subject of walking? Have you read a book that just merely glanced it? If so, I'm very curious and would be grateful.\n\nHave a nice day.",

Plenty of books and scholarly journals have mentioned Shakespeare's use of tropes from *commedia* (which I'm assuming is *commedia dell'arte?). One such trope is the theatregram. However, I have not come across a definition of the theatregram, or even an explanation of what it is. Only that Shakespeare used it. So I was hoping someone here would be able to help. :/\n\n(From what I can surmise, a theatregram is a set up in which someone overhears someone else, as if they were on a stage?

        "text": "Originally posted in r/literature but I think my question was unclear.\n \nBackground: One of my interests is nineteenth and twentieth century theatre. Recently I listened to the 1971 audio version of *The Emperor Jones* with James Earl Jones in the title role. (I downloaded it from the Internet Archive. If you haven't heard it, go download it). I've also seen the 1933 movie with Paul Robeson. It's the only O'Neill play I've read, and one of my favourite plays. And then I read some criticism of it, and I've noticed that since it premiered, most of the critics focus on either the racial/primitivism aspect, or the political commentary aspect. So far I haven't found anything on the connections between the two aspects of the play.\n\nAFAIK, some critics think TEJ is racist because:\n\n*O'Neill describes Jones as having \"typical negroid features, but there is something distinctive about his face\"\n\n*Jones speaks in the conventional Black American stage dialect used up until the 1950s, which sounds like minstrel show dialogue. \n\n * as the play progresses he's reduced to a terrified wreck, destroyed by his own conscience in a way that could be read as fitting the stereotype that Black Americans are scared of ghosts (putting aside the fact that Jones has *lost his way in dense jungle, that he's *running for his life* and that that rainforest apparently is *creepy enough even if you're a local*.\n\n* The constant use of the n-word and the fact that the character of Jones is a Black man who exploits other Black people. Some critics point out that the island is described as \"not yet self-determined by White Marines\" and that O'Neill intended the play as a comment on the occupation of Haiti.\n\nI don't think it's simply racist, or just a political commentary. \nThere are definitely primitivist elements that are racist by our standards (Lem, the local chieftain, is 'an ape-faced old savage of the genuine African type' but at the same time, this is one of the few non-subservient, heroic roles for Black actors in the 1920s; Charles Gilpin defended his performance in the play by pointing this out.  \n\nI think it's significant that the only time Jones acts like a subservient Black stereotype is in the scene where he sees the prison guard and believes he's back on the chain gang in the States again. \n\nAlso, O'Neill admitted to basing his character partially on former Haitian president Jean Guillaume Vilbrun Sam, who was torn apart by an angry mob as retribution for his treatment of political prisoners.\nTwo of the visions - horrifying depictions of a slave auction and a slave ship - were filmed but cut from the finished print of the movie because they were regarded as too controversial; they also cut out Jones' actual killing of the prison guard. Significantly, Jones' first name, 'Brutus', was a common slave name, and his Americanness is emphasised in a way that highlights his difference from the islanders; most of his uses of the n-word are prefixed with the word \"bush\". I've read some opinions that O'Neill was drawn to create characters like Jones because of his own outsider status as an Irish American from a Catholic background who grew up in the late Victorian era and was a young man in the early 20th century. \n\nWhat I'm curious about is this; if the play is simply racist, why is Smithers, the only white character in the whole play to have any lines, depicted as an unsympathetic, arrogant bigot? And if it's primarily why are the slavery 'memories' there in the first place?\n\ntl;dr; wondering if *The Emperor Jones* is about both imperialism and institutional racism. ",

        "text": "There is a famous parable that goes somewhat like this: A butterfly is struggling to emerge from its cocoon, and is helped by a person who feels sorry for it. When the butterfly emerges, not having struggled enough with the cocoon, its wings are weak and crumpled, and it is unable to fly. As the parable goes - such is the way of God/nature that it makes us struggle so that we will be able to fly.\nI always assumed it was of folk origin, or at least of a long lost untraceable one, but I am reading Zorba the Greek, by Nikos Kazantzakis, and I have seen a passage in the book where the narrator claims it has happened to him, and does not seem to refer to any similar known story.\nThis makes me wonder whether this book can actually be the source of the parable? Is there any earlier printed version of it Kazantzakis is likely to have encountered?\nThe passage in the book I'm referring to is: https://goo.gl/8h7EEk\n\nMany Thanks!",

I like how he does criticism but it annoys me that he always compares characters from the particular literary work he is writing about to characters from Shakespeare's plays. I'd like to know other people's thoughts about him.",

I know very little about Arthurian legend and I've been trying to supplement my ignorance by reading wiki articles and encyclopedia entries. I've since come to the realization that I've underestimated the density of the subject and overestimated my ability to learn it rapidly and keep schedule. I'm likely to throw this project on the back burner until I feel comfortable enough with the subject. \n\nSo, I'm looking for something old and thick. *Ahem*, to read, I mean. I know the legend and the key figures but not in great detail. I know it has fishing lines in many different moats (plz don't crucify me). It has its place in history, mythology, and literature but I don't really have any idea where one ends and the other begins. What can I read to make me an expert --or at least sound like I have any idea what I'm talking about?",

I'm teaching Brit Lit to some American high school students, and while I have good texts for them to read, I lack good material that introduces them to the British influence on literature worldwide, and especially on the spread of the English language.  I will be using texts from around the British Empire, and from all over it.  I just want something simple to tie it all together.  Any advice is greatly appreciated.  Cheers.",

I have not pinned down yet the conceptual matrix I'll be working with so I don't know how to better explain what I'm looking for, but it would be something along the lines of the writer's political agency, social responsability or, as I put in the title (was the closest \"known\" term I could think of), the writer as a public intellectual.\n\nI would be very thankful if someone could point me some material along these lines. (Considering that any of you understood this mess of a text, lol)\n\nThank you very much.",

I understand the importance of form and content but how wise is it to interpret a text based upon an analysis of its author, rather than the text alone? For example, if I was reading Cervantes, I would study early modern Spain and Cervantes' life in order to understand his work. Is this a wise approach or should I take only a closed text interpretation?",
