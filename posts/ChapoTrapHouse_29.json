The two times our chapos discussed the whole ordeal have felt cathartic, but i think Will is way too optimistic when he says kavanaugh is circling the drain. matt's got the appropriate take: they're going to double down so they can win. power and domination are the only two things that matter to this mischief of rats and rat fuckers. why would they drop their guy because he's been accused of rape? the king rat himself is an avowed rapist! don't want to implicate the boss, put kavanaugh on the court!\n\n\nwhen i try to log on to more neutral spaces, all i see is this bowsette meme being posted by reactionary, thirsty gamer weebs. makes me uncomfortable how much mileage this meme is getting without any real LGBTQ discourse around it because, well, it's a nerdboi meme. Definitely willing to get into a struggle session over this.\n\nI just finished playing \"night in the woods\" for the first time. Mainly focused on Bea because she reminds me of friends I used to have in high school. Damn, it felt so good to play a game with overtly leftist themes. I'm going to replay it and hang out with Gregg this week, but the game gave me some serious parasocial feelings. reminds me how lonely i am living and working on the outskirts of Appalachia. \n\n\nYo, my chapos, i hope everyone is having an alright week. tell me how dumb i am for disliking everyone new's gender-swapped waifu and/or that kavanaugh isn't getting on the court because the moral arc of the universe bends towards justice.\n",
