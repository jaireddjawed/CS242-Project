        "author": "WhenIntegralsAttack",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/89kw15/discussion_femininity_and_masculinity_as/",
        "text": "Hi, r/literature,\n\nI just finished reading Euripides' *Medea*, and I wanted to start a discussion. I know Greek tragedy isn't the usual stuff posted here, but I think it's an important piece of literature/drama. This would also be a good way to start a discussion on the portrayal of gender roles in literature and how (mostly) women and (some) men have rebelled against those roles. \n\nMedea is an interesting character in Euripides' play, as she occupies a median between being sympathetic and not, and being classically feminine and masculine. She embodies classically feminine roles in abandoning her birth family and homeland to marry Jason, give birth to their children, and preserve his hereditary line. In several of her soliloquies, she speaks of motherly love to her children and of womanly desire for Jason and men in general. All of this was expected of a woman in classical Greece (and partly today as well.)\n\nShe also embodies classically masculine attributes, namely her participation in violent action and her scheming. Even before the murders she enacts in the play, she convinces Pelias's daughters to murder him, and she betrays her family and saves the voyagers on the Argo. She is an intelligent woman prone to action. She actually has many of the same attributes of the Greek Hero Odysseus. \n\nWhen Jason betrays her, she has absolutely no recourse to help herself within a conventionally feminine role. The chorus of women state in multiple instances that she is not the first woman to be betrayed by a man, and that she should simply accept her fate. This is the classically feminine respond, and it leaves her destitute. On the other hand, the masculine Jason will marry a princess and inherit a throne.\n\nNo man would be forced to accept such a fate acting in classically masculine roles. Medea, has no such option acting as a woman. Compare this to Ajax's belief in his slaughtering of his comrades in Sophocles' *Ajax* (he actually slaughters goats, but he is insane and believes he is slaughtering his comrades). He is never condemned for attempting to take vengeance, and his shame is that he was incapable of doing so. Violence and vengeance would be within the conception of masculinity, and so a man could at least enact retribution for spurned oaths and love. \n\nThe point is that the entire classical conceptualization of what a woman is left her powerless in this situation. Thus, Medea made the choice to abandon that concept, and instead act as a man. Her embodying these dual characteristics allows Euripides to examine gender roles. Medea has enough femininity to suffer from the societal order, but she also has enough masculinity to rebel against it. \n\nWith this forfeiture of her femininity, I think she also forfeit's her role as mother to her children. The entire societal order which is crushing her is literally patriarchal. Marriage serves the function to give men male heirs. Women are only biological necessity by which men pass down power to their male children. Motherhood is a tool needed to raise the family and preserve the male line. If Medea is going to rebel against this system, she literally cannot maintain her motherhood. Preserving her motherhood would preserve Jason's male line and the entire impetus of the oppressive societal structure. \n\nWhile Medea's actions are deplorable, they are absolutely necessary. Medea cannot rebel against a system of oppression while also keeping alive the very reason the system exists: male children. Is she morally justified in murdering her children? I find her at least sympathetic.\n\nWhat do you all think? Is there more depth and nuance to Medea that I'm missing? Do you disagree with me about something? Comment!\n\n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/88mtq6/mercutio_mightve_been_a_free_slave_doesnt/",
        "text": "Relating back to the time the story was set in, slavery was still a thing. Especially in Europe which is why slavery spread to the Americas. In the story, Mercutio is neutral to both houses and it is possible that he is a free slave.  This theory can also explain why he is friends with Romeo. Romeo is a person of high status, he certainly has the money, and has the loving parents to let him free Mercutio. We also know that Mercutio is a jokester and a lot of jokesters have tragic backstories. It is also possible that Lady or Lord Montague took Mercutio in, but this scenario is less likely due to Mercutio’s neutrality being hard to explain. Mercutio is the only neutral character introduced to the story alongside Friar Laurence and the police. Both 2 other characters can be related to slavery. It is very likely that the police have a relationship with Mercutio, because their decision not to execute Romeo on the spot. In the older times, people were stricter especially the police. The punishment for murder is hanging or execution. Nobody really cared about Mercutio for what we the readers know besides Romeo and Benvolio. Later in the story Benvolio betrays Romeo, so it is possible that Benvolio cares more about his mortality than his friends, or maybe he didn’t like them that much, or maybe a mixture of both. The only person that really cared about Mercutio was Tybalt when he felt guilt after accidentally killing him. This is assumed by the reader, but we know for a fact that Tybalt was hotheaded so it is very unlikely that he felt enough guilt to care about Mercutio. With Romeo dead, no one would care for Mercutio. Also, it is suggested that Tybalt had an affair with Lady Capulet, so she would feel sad. She probably wants Romeo to die for revenge so she would be happy too. The Montagues loved their Romeo, but eventually they would recognize that the law was the law and that no matter what they do, they can’t save him. Everybody except Romeo and Juliet believe that Paris is a much better husband suited for Juliet, so the Capulets would be happy. Juliet kept her love for Romeo because he was still alive and wanted to marry him after she escapes. She cannot love Romeo forever especially if he is dead. Unless she kills herself again, everything falls in to place. It all makes sense that the police should execute Romeo, but they didn’t. It isn’t like Shakespeare can’t write dark things and he was trying to appeal to the lower-class people. Many readers today say that he wasn’t executed because he did the right thing or something like that. However, in the time Rome and Juliet was set in, doing the right thing holds no power over the law. The only reasonable explanation for why the police would not execute Romeo is because of Mercutio. First, both them share the neutrality concept and since earlier in this theory, we assumed the police has a relationship with Mercutio, the police know that Mercutio likes neutrality and peace, which is the opposite of killing Romeo. They were not there when Mercutio said his last dying breath and plaguing the houses. They probably want the best for what Mercutio might want. Banishing Romeo is a closest way to keep neutrality, because the Montagues know that Romeo is not dead so they wouldn’t feel as sad. Lady Capulet will still be sad, but knows that Romeo will not bother her again. Also, Lady Capulet wants her daughter to marry Paris instead of loving Romeo. ",

        "text": "Correct me if I am misled, but it seems to me that for a work of contemporary fiction to have staying power, it must to some degree be \"self-aware.\"\nLet me explain what I mean by this. Take Nabokov's *Pale Fire*, for instance. The work pokes fun at the idea of artistic criticism. Meanwhile, the novel itself is structured as a piece of artistic criticism, (a poem followed by a commentary) and for years after its publication, it has lent itself to loads of artistic criticism. It prods and laughs at that which its own elegance of form invites! \n\nOr take Stoppard's *Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead*. Here is a play about two goofballs walking around a play. Throughout the play, the audience is teased. We the audience begin to wonder: Do these characters know they are being watched?\n\nThis is a trend that I'm sure is well-documented in literary studies, but my basic question is this: Why aren't we simply satisfied with a good story anymore? A storyteller in the vein of Dickens or Trollope would no doubt be respected as a good writer today, but would this storyteller's work be remembered in seventy years if it simply dwelt on plot and made no effort to wink at the reader? \n\nOur conception of reality is man in a hall of mirrors gazing at endless simulacra of himself. If a work of art wishes to have staying power, it must reflect this contemporary reality by functioning to some degree as a criticism of itself. It seems a genuine, innocent story is no longer enough to satiate us. Is this a real trend, or am I exaggerating?",

        "text": "Hello /r/literature. Maybe this is a bad post, more of an observation. I am curious to canvas opinion.\n\nI've been reading Ulysses, slowly, for about 6 months now, without referring to study notes. Last week I finished the front nine and got through into chapter 10. I'm reading an e-copy and I was slightly appalled to notice that halfway through the chapters is only about a third of the way through the book.\n\nI've never read Joyce before, and I took nothing but delight from the first four chapters of the book. The language, the erudition, the imagination on display were wonderful. Best of all were the characters. By the end of chapter 4, it almost felt like Stephen and Leopold were good friends. Masterful stuff.\n\nThen, it began to fall apart. I do not believe there is much of literary value at all in chapters 5-7. They're dire, dragging, blowsy crawls through the tedium of everyday life. You could argue, of course, that 3 and 4 are similar. But it feels to me like those chapters delight in the minutiae of the mundane, celebrate it, use it to help the reader shine a light on the human condition. Chapters 5-7, by contrast, merely describe it. Without much of Joyce's more inspirational prose, either.\n\nThey only seem to exist, these chapters, to support the books' laboured analogy with Greek myth. I did read some students notes on these chapters, and it did nothing to disabuse my opinion. Indeed a couple of the books' fans seem to agree with me. If I'm right, I would argue that's a pretty big black mark against a novel, no matter how great the rest of it is.\n\nChapter 8 is better, back to the delight of trawling through Bloom's head. And while chapter 9 is impossible to follow unless you're a devotee of Hamlet I'll give it its literary merit for some curious arguments and - again - it advances both the characters of the book and its major themes, as well as some lovely language.\n\nNow we're in chapter 10, and it's got that 5-7 feel again.\n\nThis windy bag of opinions is to say: aspects of this book are masterful. Beyond compare in my experience. Yet I can't help feel it's also pathetically self-indulgent. That it would have been an even better book as a whole if an editor had taken a very large knife to much of chapters 5-7 and 10. \n\nI'm carrying on, so we'll see how the rest measures up in terms of indulgence. But it's a shame there's as much as there is.",
