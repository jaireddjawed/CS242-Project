In my late 20s, I have dated many men but have found them immature and not wanting marriage or children. I have a good job, am financially stable, and am decently attractive. I am starting to lose hope that I will ever have children and fear I will become bitter and lonely. I’m worried that I will never get married and consequently never have children (not that those two necessarily need to go hand in hand). I am looking for any advice from women who have been a similar position. Please don’t feel the need to sugar coat it. If children may not happen for me, I’m also open to advice on how to prepare myself to accept that.",

        "text": "I have been married for almost 6 years (29F) to a guy (32M) who was a really great friend to me before we started dating. I never was really attracted to him, but he was so sweet and patient and didn't make me feel pressured to date him like so many other of my guy friends did. Long story short, a few of my best friends moved away, and a series of other things happened to where I was left with really no one except my now husband. But he said he couldn't be my friend anymore because it was too painful. So... Considering how lonely and desperate for companionship I felt, we started dating. \n\nWe ended up getting married a little over a year after that. He had to move away for a job and it was either break up or get married and move with him. Some of my family members (who were MIA around the time we started dating) thought I could do better than this guy and I felt pretty alienated by them for dating my now husband. So I chose to move with him and get married. \n\nHe ended up having severe anger and depression issues I had no idea about until right after we were married. Our sexual connection was so so at first. He was the first and only guy I had ever been with. But the more we have been married, it feels like I am having sex with a guy friend whom I have no romantic feelings for. I am trying to let him in and connect with him, but it's like everything in me wants to hold him at arms length. And he senses it and it's corroding our sex life and intimacy. \n\nI know what chemistry with a guy feels like due to my first relationship I ever had. We never had sex but we did other things and it was amazing. And I find myself trying not to fantasize about this guy and what it would be like to have that type of chemistry in a marriage. \n\nMy husband and I have been in counseling for over a year trying to deal with our conflict resolution. We luckily hardly ever fight anymore, but it's almost made things worse. It's like we're roommates or just best friends. I know he loves me and would do anything for me. But that almost makes me feel worse because I feel like I am cheating the both of us out of a way better relationship. I'm just so scared and lost and confused feeling. I can't imagine being single again. And I feel like no one will want to date me considering the baggage I will have if I am divorced so young. Not to mention how insecure and terrible this relationship has made me feel about myself. I feel like I will be a terrible wife no matter who I marry.\nAlso, he has no family and no friends or support system. I know this is codependent, but I really fear he will fly off the handle if we divorce. \n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation, where they loved their partner but just couldn't seem to make the connection happen ? If so, what did you do and how did it end up ? \n\nIf anyone made it all the way to the end, thanks for reading my mini novel.",

That all the photos were taken with more of a present state of mind vs curated (and often edited) to be posted on a grid later. \n\nFor the first two years of my son's life I posted a lot of photos/stories of him on Instagram. He's a bit older now and all of that content has since been deleted. I don't currently have any social media so I don't post photos of him anywhere. I had started feeling guilty about posting so many photos of him online without his consent. Even though my accounts were private with relatively few followers (only friends and family) and even then, the photos are still on a database being used for who knows what. Some friends expressed that they missed seeing what my son is up to (and same for me with their kids) so now we text exchange photos/videos every once in awhile.\n\nIf you do post photos of your children online without guilt, what is your justification? What is the answer if they someday see all of this content and they're upset their lives were posted online? \n\nDo any of you have older children who have expressed this already, or have you seen this happen with your friends? \n\nSemi-related, I think it'll be interesting once the kids of influencers get old enough to realize how badly they were used to make ad money for their parents and lawsuits start happening against the parents.",

I don’t think I’m special, but I do think it’s hitting me hard in a lot of ways and it feels like everyone else seems to have moved on.\n\nLike many, I lost loved ones to Covid. I lost one job and quit another due to Covid closures at my kid’s school eating up my vacation/sick time and unsympathetic bosses making my life miserable. We decimated our savings when my husband was laid off. I gained 50 pounds. My therapist left the field. I ended friendships after figuring out how many friends and family would let me down in so many different ways by not practicing basic pandemic safety by wearing a mask to events and flat out lying about being symptomatic. I also got Covid and now have issues with memory and aphasia that continue to impact my life.\n\nI’ve sort of half rebuilt my life - I’ve got a new job, our finances are much better, I’m trying to build new friendships and I’ve lost 5 pounds this month. But mentally I’m still a mess and I can’t find a therapist accepting patients near me who seems like they would be a good fit. The one I found made some comments about my weight and told me I shouldn’t be afraid to eat out during Covid spikes, so I fired her. \n\nStill trying to find a new one but kind of also feeling like I’d rather process it on my own after the terrible experience I had with the one therapist I could get in to see. I feel like I’d feel a lot less alone if I heard from other people who still haven’t felt like they’ve “recovered.”\n\nSome things I’m still trying to address: \n\n-Anyone coughing near me immediately makes me panic, sometimes to the point of a panic attack\n\n-I’m constantly afraid I’m going to lose my job and have a lot of distrust for my boss and my company because of how I was treated at the jobs I held during Covid and how little those workplaces cared about my health and safety and were unwilling to be flexible with in office requirements.\n\n-Any time I hear about a new virus circulating (RSV, possibly Avian flu) I get obsessed with reading as much about it as possible. I think part of this is that I did read a lot about Covid in February 2020 and “prepped” for it….and those preps meant I had everything we needed for lockdown. So now I feel like I need to do that with any potential pandemic but it feels unhealthy. I think being “right” and having so many people look to me for guidance as I was the friend group expert was ultimately damaging to me - I carried too much responsibility in addition to working, parenting and sitting on a city board.\n\n-I struggle with talking too much about Covid - it’s clear no one wants to hear about it anymore, even during spikes, and I’m afraid it’s causing a gulf between me and the loved ones who I still see when I talk about it. So I can’t really process the trauma with anyone. \n\nIs anyone else still experiencing some sort of PTSD? Any pearls of wisdom or strategies, especially if you’re lucky enough to access good mental health care?",

Several months into dating her, she asked me to move back to her country with her. I said yes and was genuinely excited about this possibility. I started learning her language, etc. But now that it is time for her to start the process of actually going back, we are running into some road blocks for me moving with her. I was hoping to get a woman's perspective on this.\n\nEssentially, the issue is that I cannot work in her country because I cannot get an organization to sponsor me and until now, my GF does not seem to want to get married (which would provide me with a residence and work authorization). I believe this is part cultural, part personal philosophy, and part of it is that it was not \"in the plan\", which I understand and appreciate. I think she assumed it would be easier for me to get a job sponsorship since her company sponsored her. Once she realized it was in fact very hard for me to actually get sponsored, she has put in a lot of work to try to help me find a job or find a way for me to go over there. \n\nThe difficult and confusing part of this is that we really love each other and I think we are both heart broken about things potentially not being able to work.\n\nShe does come from a difficult family who it seems she feels may be judgmental about her decisions. I think there is a lot of unresolved trauma/issues with her parents, etc. Her mother seems to like me, though. I haven't met her parents, but have communicated slightly through my GF with them. She was initially hesitant to even tell her parents about me, but she did, which I know what a big move for her.\n\nShe was telling me the other day how unfair it is that this is all so hard. \"We've both been through so much and we deserve to be happy\" she said (to the effect). I have my own trauma background as well. She was saying she was so unhappy in her job for several years (she got kind of stuck being her during covid) but then she met me and things changed so positively for her. This is our first relationship for the both of us.\n\nShe suggested doing a long distance relationship to give us more time for me to find a job. As she said, we are trying to cram something that takes a long time, into a shorter amount of time. But she also said she couldn't give me a longer term plan about what would happen if I didn't get a job. She also seemed to indicate that I would have to maintain my own work visa in her country and that we would not be getting married (even for the work/residence purposes).\n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts? Has anyone experienced this type of thing before?",

        "text": "Last summer, I found out my husband had been making secret plans to move back to his home country. (see my post history)\n\nFinding out his secret plans was devastating. I asked him multiple times what was going on. I overheard him talking and was certain it was an interview and he lied to my face. I eventually looked at his computer and phone and it was all there. It looked like he’d been making plans for 8 months. Half our marriage. Lined up a job and a place to live and I was not part of those plans at all. \n\nI confronted him and said he needed to make a choice, but I loved him enough to let him go if he wasn’t happy here. I had done everything I could to make him happy and help him achieve his goals.  Supported him in post secondary by editing his papers, packed lunches for work, cooked foods from his home country, worked on learning the language, tried to do anything and everything to show him how much I loved him. \n\nHe was working out of town at the time. As far as I could tell he was just planning to leave without telling me. He had virtually nothing to say as to why he was leaving me. In a few weeks, I went from thinking I was a happy newlywed to having my husband leave the continent with no explanation. \n\nI managed to get him to sign a separation agreement before he left and I figured things out with vehicle transfers and found out he hadn’t submitted the documents needed to be on my bank account so everything was ok from a financial standpoint. Except that I had paid most of the bills while he saved for our future together, and he obviously left with his savings account. \n\nMaybe a month after he left, he emailed me. Saying he was a fool, he fantasized about going back and having a great life there but it wasn’t great and he still loved me and realized I was the best that ever happened to him and he would make it up to me for the rest of my life if I took him back. \n\nI still didn’t really know why he left and was absolutely devastated by his betrayal, so I asked some questions about what on earth was going on and why he left and to explain himself. He replied back saying he didn’t mean it and was just feeling down. \n\nSince then, I have gone no contact to try to heal. I’ve cried every day for the past five months because I loved this man with everything I had. I never imagined he could treat me this way. I’ve been going to therapy regularly, have support from my family and wonderful friends, and am trying to do all kinds of healthy things to heal. But it’s the most devastating thing I’ve ever been through. \n\nSince then he’s been emailing me every few weeks apologizing, saying he left because he felt like life was boring and passing him by so he wanted to go back to the wild single life he had in his 20s (we are late 30s). Now that he’s done that and done hard drugs, he realized it doesn’t make him happy and I’m the only thing he wants and he’ll get help and this was just a midlife crisis. He’s not a bad person, he was just lost. He’s begging for forgiveness and a chance to make things up to me and win me back. \n\nI have been no contact this whole time and he keeps emailing me. I finally sent him one message to say the divorce would be proceeding and he’s still emailing me begging me to take him back, five months after he left. \n\nLogically, I think I’m making the right choice. He planned this for eight months. He let me pay the bills while he saved for his own purposes. He lied to my face so many times. He talked about our future together. When I questioned him about feeling distant, he said he was just stressed. He even had his parents booking their flight here and didn’t let them know he wasn’t planning to be here. \n\nEmotionally, I’m a mess. I cry most days. Every time he emails me I want to believe him and tell him I’ll take him back. I worry about him. And if this is a midlife crisis then what kind of wife am I if I desert him at this time? He says he’ll get help and he’ll work on his issues. \n\nWriting it all out like this, it feels so stupid. Of course a husband who lied to your face and made secret plans for eight months and ghosted his marriage is not good for me. \n\nBut has anyone had a partner who had a spectacular midlife crisis and completely sabotaged their life? Did they ever turn things around? He says even if I divorce him he will still wait for me and if he could fix things he’d do it in a heartbeat. Am I a fool for pining for him? I never thought I’d find the kind of love I had with him. I truly believe in my marriage vows. I never ever thought I’d get divorced or have my marriage end like this.",

Our talks about the future mostly center around his plans and desires, with little consideration for mine. I've tried bringing up my feelings and thoughts, but they're usually steamrolled in the conversation, leaving me feeling like I don't have a say. This has me questioning the level of commitment he has to our relationship and if he sees me in his future in a meaningful way. Sometimes I feel like I am just a convenience to him and don't really feel special, and other times I wonder if my insecurities are taking hold. \n\nI don't want to push him into a commitment he's not ready for, but I also don't want to waste my time in a relationship where I'm not a priority. I understand that everyone moves at their own pace, but it's hard to be in a stagnant relationship. I don't want to spend my \"hot\" years with someone who isn't willing to prioritize my hopes and dreams for our future. \n\nIf anyone has been in a similar situation or has any advice, I'm all ears.",

Also, I have enough life experience and wisdom to know when something is a waste of my time and this would be one of those scenarios. Also, I genuinely don’t care to try to mend anything here. \n\nI have thought about long term implications of this decision for both myself and my child and how we may miss out on aspects of life by cutting out this person. I can’t think of any loss except I could keep things cordial for my son to make him think he has a family member that “cares”. But he has other family (mom, dad, sister, her husband, my friends, his dads dad) who do genuinely care and make an effort with my son and are better influences. \n\nThe truth is, he hasn’t seen myself or my son in 7 years (my son is 10 and my brother makes PLENTY of money and could come visit while he’s off visiting random women all the time that he’s trying to fuck) doesn’t make an effort to know how we are, and he doesn’t reach out or attempt any real relationship with myself or my child besides an occasional holiday gift and card. \n\nHe judges anyone as beneath him who doesn’t live his textbook white heteronormative lifestyle and he’s super critical of pretty much everything. He texts me random texts about things I “should” do for my son when he doesn’t have kids of his own and is generally clueless about how the world works outside of his early 30s conservative republican “christian” lifestyle. \n\nI guess one thought is- would I feel horrible if he suddenly died, would I have regret, etc? \n\nThe answer for me is no, I honestly don’t think so. I would feel bad for my family members who would be sad but I probably wouldn’t feel very much about it. I wouldn’t bad mouth him and don’t plan to. I just don’t wish to ever speak to him or pretend like all is good. \n\nHe is sexist, misogynistic, rude, has lots of narcissistic qualities, and he generally truly doesn’t care about anyone else except himself and his image on social media while posting Jordan Peterson quotes about being an honorable man. \n\nHe is constantly whining that my dad wasn’t around and that his own uncles never poured into him while he grew up in a single mother household- yet he’s made zero attempts to know my son or my sisters sons. \n\nI know this may also cause a rift in my family but I also don’t care about that either. \n\nI feel a bit heartless in this decision but I’ve gone back and forth for years and don’t have it in me anymore to pretend. \n\nI’m open to any and all feedback. I know I sound heartless but… I don’t care? Lol somehow I care that I don’t care. How is it possible to feel so done with someone like this?",

So I told him, and he didn't take it well, at all.\n\nI am a confident, independent, forward-thinking woman, and he describes himself as more conservative. We both come from similar backgrounds and have so much in common. But when I shared that with him, our entire relationship went south. Not two hours earlier he called me his girlfriend for the first time, and we were planning a trip for Valentine's Day.\n\nI am incredibly hurt by his reaction but am so proud of myself for my level of emotional intelligence and communication throughout this process. All of my previous experiences have taught me so many lessons, but I am so hurt that my partner reacted the way he did.\n\nWe left it to him having some time and space to process, but honestly, I'm feeling totally fine, besides a couple of moments of sadness. I really liked this guy, and to have this whole relationship ruined because of his inability to communicate is heartbreaking.\n\nLadies, I would appreciate your advice and words of wisdom.",

I know there are a lot of articulate and aware women in this sub and I'm hoping someone can shed some light on what's wrong with me.\n\nBriefly, I (F45) have been seeing someone new (M62) since about 3 months and things have been going well for the most part, aside from a few minor blips which we resolved with simple communication.\n\nThere is one thing though that really disturbs me...for whatever reason that I cannot yet understand, this man has managed to bring out the jealous side of me, which until now I never really knew existed.   I've never been a jealous partner before or otherwise experienced jealousy, which I have to say is a horrible feeling in general.  That said, I'm managing to keep it under control thus far.\n\nThe current issue:  He is going on a four or five day trip abroad soon with several of his women friends  (they will be dancing), and this trip was planned from before we met.  My problem is I feel left out and jealous, not just of the women he will dance with but also because he's going abroad without me.  Yes it's unreasonable, but it's what I'm feeling.    \n\nWith those bad feelings stirred up inside me, I am thinking  I would like to NOT exchange messages during his trip, as I know if he sends me pictures or talks about the dances, it will just trigger me even more.  In a way, if we go \"off the radar\" for 4-5 days, I can try to ignore the fact of my jealousy.  He has rejected this idea saying it's not possible for him to go 4-5 days of no contact and he doesn't want to.\n\nSO I'm aware that something is very wrong and it's on my side....but I don't know how else to deal with this situation and my strong emotions, which I never had for another partner before.  \n\nCan someone please explain myself to me ?  Maybe there's a better solution for managing this situation ?  AITA here ?  I think I must be.\n\nPlease help!",

        "text": "My boyfriend (41) and I (F, 45) have been together just over a year, and I'm struggling to know if I should accept the level of emotional connection, communication, commitment, effort and emotional stability he seems able or willing to offer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe met online dating in November 2021. The first few months were rocky, as he said he was recovering from a recent break-up, and had been really in love with his ex (they'd been together just over a year). I broke up with him in March 2022 because of his lack of effort, lack of communication and general ambivalence (sometimes voiced) towards me. Initially, I was so happy to be free of the constraints of the relationship - the moodiness, lack of effort and unnecessary frugality.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe got back together in June 2021. Things have been up and down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe has BPD and struggles to regulate his emotions. He is not currently in therapy, and due to insurance issues, is no longer going to the bi-weekly group therapy he used to go to (although, he was being very passive about making that group something useful to himself). I am supportive and understanding of his BPD but I have to tiptoe around his emotions, am not allowed to really display any negative emotions of my own, need to be careful of his triggers (meal preparation, driving, etc.). He struggles to communicate, even when I try to provide a supportive environment. We went to a sexual health counsellor once - it was fantastic - but he is really dragging his feet on returning to her, even though he agreed it was helpful. Regarding meals, he is on the autoimmune protocol diet (very restrictive), and has long covid and doesn't want to catch covid again, so will not eat in \"crowded\" restaurants. That's fine, we're both great cooks and enjoy cooking - except he usually gets completely stressed out cooking and makes it unpleasant for everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe struggles to communicate on relationship topics and doesn't make attempts to build a stronger emotional connection between us. I feel I'm never going to live up to the connection he had with his ex (even though he says this was \"enmeshment\" - which I don't have any experience of or understand what that entails). He sometimes does thoughtful things for me, sometimes puts in effort. But it feels really unbalanced.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur sex life is good to average. I have to initiate a lot. I try to find ways to put him in a comfortable position so that he can initiate. We never sleep in the same bed - he's a very light sleeper. I mostly sleep out in the loungeroom when he stays at my house. He gets annoyed if his sleep is disturbed (I wake up earlier than him, and try to be as quiet as possible, but that's impossible, and I live in a small apartment).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI carry a lot of the \"mental load\". I am always thinking ahead to meals, logistics, fun things we can do together. He occasionally puts in this kind of effort - and it's so great when he does, and I'm so appreciative - but it mostly falls on me. When I get frustrated about his lack of effort and stop doing anything he does seem to notice and pick up his efforts. I have communicated, in what I think is a gentle way, that I feel I make a lot of effort and that is tiring to always feel like I have that responsibility.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI cannot see a future where we take holidays together, move in together, get married, have children - any of those kinds of relationship milestones. These are things I would love to do with a partner. He \\*mostly\\* doesn't want kids. I have never pressured him on this, or even spoken to him about this, because at 45, my chances of getting pregnant seem minimal. We have unprotected sex, but don't ever talk about that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe is very frugal, which limits the activities he will do, and his level of happiness when we do do activities (they weren't \"worth the cost\"). He will spend money on groceries (and good quality groceries), on some minimal meals out, on wine, on hiking equipment and on health things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm going on holidays to Japan at Easter and I did not ask him to come with me: I think it would be miserable than to have to tiptoe around his moods, organise all the logistics, and deal with his frugality. I don't necessarily care about taking holidays together, I'd be fine to take holidays alone for the rest of my life (it's what I've been doing up until now). It'd just be nice to be able to share those experiences with a partner.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHis long covid is preventing him from doing the hobbies he likes - hiking and cycling - so this does make him sad. With his BPD, I don't think he even has a strong sense of what he likes to do, but he's settled on these as something to do. I don't really think he has long covid (I think he's a hypochondriac) - I think he's out of shape because he stopped exercising before covid (because he needed that time to do some renovations), and part of what he thinks are his long covid symptoms is his current lack of fitness. His autoimmune disease is largely under control, except he can't deviate too much from the AIP diet or he feels symptoms.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday was my birthday: he got to my place and was in a bad mood because the traffic had been heavy (an hour instead of 20-30 minutes). I had to suggest places to go out to dinner (I'd said I really wanted to go out to dinner because we rarely eat out) - I had to find places where he wouldn't be in a crowded (non-covid safe) space, and that would have food he could eat (AIP-friendly). We grabbed some wine from my fridge, I drove us to a pizza place, bought (paid for) the pizzas, we ate them in a park. He was a bit moody but also a bit ok, but was also on his phone (reddit) a bit. Lying on the blanket, I tried to lie closer or semi-cuddle (not sure how to describe), but he was unresponsive. We came home, and by this point I had stopped trying to initiate any effort with what we should do next, so we lay on the couch a while, then I had a shower and went to bed. I gave him some cherries (I'd bought them as a birthday present for myself - it's the end of the season and they're more expensive), and he ate them. He conceded they were good (usually everything is \"ok\"). He eventually came to bed. We lay there for a while (10-15 minutes), me reading and then snoozing, and him watching a video on his phone. Then I left to go and set up my bed in the loungeroom. He offered, but didn't insist, that he sleep in the loungeroom. This was how he helped me celebrate my birthday. He didn't bring a present or flowers or anything - said he'd been thinking of something for me (a fabric or ceramics tour for while I'm in Japan) but hadn't got it yet. I don't necessarily care about presents, but it was one more thing indicating his lack of effort on this day, and in general.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe's lacking in motivation in life. He has a secure job and is very financially secure. He has a strong network of friends. He doesn't have hobbies. He spends a lot of time on reddit (I don't think he knows I have this second username), and now that he's not exercising, playing video games.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do like him. We share similar values (politics, the environment, mental health, health, etc.). He can be really funny. He can be really attractive. He is very loyal and reliable (but often reliably moody).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI haven't had many relationships in my life. I struggle to connect to men. And yet, this relationship is not satisfying. We do have fun times occasionally (so hard to predict, with all this moods and the constraints), but there's no depth to our emotional connection, no shared vision for our future, an inability to communicate, and just all those limitations, constraints and difficulty in being with him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have tried and tried to make a supportive environment for him to open up and communicate and connect, and he's just doesn't seem able. At this point in time, I don't feel disappointed or frustrated, I feel somewhat resigned to how things are.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat else can I do to communicate my expectations about this relationship, and provide a space for him to communicate and connect? Is this all there is? I am trying to be supportive, to compromise, etc. but this balance just feels unacceptable.",

Etc… before I eventually dragged it out her and she said she was thinking she could come with me, even went to work in half decent clothes so she could come lunch with me after and separate time said she would rather come out with me than work.\n\nOn birthdays, she does photo collages of family members with photos of the person… on my birthday it was all photos of me and her, and mutual friend said it looked like she was celebrating us rather than me.\n\nBefore christmas, we was supposed to be going out with her, her kids, me and my son… my son couldn’t make it and she wouldn’t go with another family member of hers instead… but was happy to go with just me on my own like a family outing.\n\nDid job for her few days ago, and she was just laying down watching me and said, \n\n“It was actually calming watching you do those fiddly bits”\n\nAnd kept on remarking about my hair,\n\nFirst said “I like it”\n\nThen, “your hair looks good like that, big green ✅”\n\n“It suits you, looks smart.”\n\n\nWasn’t even like we was talking about it… just randomly kept mentioning it.\n\n\nShe is even being a bit enthusiastic about helping me with some work I’ve got to do, even if it’s just keeping me company she said.\n\nShe’s even made joke remarks about me self indulging, and admitted to being curious as to my size.\n\nWe have 2 outings planned with her kids and my son over this month and next.\n\nIf she don’t reply for hours, she tells me she’s not ignoring me, explains herself and says she will reply soon.\n\nFor Christmas she got me 4 separate gifts.\n\nBut she insists it’s friends and she don’t feel anything at all.\n\nAbove is just tip of the iceburg really….\n\nJust feel so confused, nobody I’ve talked to about full story says it’s normal friends, but she insists it is. She don’t seem to act like this with other friends.\n\nI’m presently trying to separate myself from her, like not messaging her first, stop talking if she gives a dead end reply like oh ok etc.\n\nBut she smelled a rat and said I was acting weird, and that she could sense something was up and tried to drag it out of me. I didn’t tell but it’s difficult.\n\nI once blocked her and cut myself off for 6 months… she never stopped trying to contact me, messaged me while blocked… asking mutual friend how I was, if I didn’t go to a party asking if I was invited.\n\nThen when she eventually got through to me, she wouldn’t let me end the conversation.\n\nThing is also her story keeps changing?\n\nSometimes it’s been she’s with somebody and doesn’t know if she wants to feel or not.\n\nOther times it’s been, she’s thought about it, but is worried about loosing me f it goes wrong.\n\nOther another it was, she’s happy with how things are and likes how it’s always growing and developing naturally and if it’s meant to be then it will happen on its own.\n\nThen next minute it’s a flat out don’t feel anything, never will.\n\nAnd yet the constant is how she acts toward me and how things are, never changes more like friends, just keeps growing.",

        "text": "(I am sorry for yet another post about dating, I know how people don't like when there are too many posts about it in this sub.)\n\nLately my friends and I are running into the same problems with dating. All pretty standard issues you see a lot on this sub.  None of my \\~10 friends has managed to find a long term partner in the last 4 years or so. Some have gone on hundreds of app dates, some do a ton of IRL hobbies and social stuff and have incredibly large friendship/community networks, some just \"let life happen\" and don't do apps at all. We are all in therapy, have fitness and self-care routines, many of us have pets and other hobbies, and of course strong friendships. And yet everyone is still in the same boat. Maybe covid played a role. For the most part, I think everyone is trying, learning, and making good decisions. I don't see any clear mistakes being made.\n\nI used to feel some sort of kinship in our shared struggles and actively sought out friendships with these single women because of that, but lately it's taken a turn. I don't have any optimism to offer my friends and they don't either. It used to be a we're all in the same boat and we'll all get through this, now it's like... are we ever gonna get off this boat? Do I just live on this boat now? It's weird to have a lot of kinship built around a phase of life that we don't particularly enjoy and are trying to leave... but without the energy and optimism from a few years ago. \n\n(I know people will tell me a partner isn't everything and to just accept that I have no control, but I am just looking for friendship advice that is premised on the understanding that partnership is a fundamental and understandable desire for many people.)

I feel terribly about it now, but I can also acknowledge that I was in a bad place at that time. \n\nWe connected over shared experiences about mental health and anxiety and the grueling, demanding reality of graduate student life. During one conversation, I shared my struggles with maintaining relationships and the ease with which I cut ties with people. I remember vividly his asking me if I would do that to him and my responding that I wouldn’t. \n\nI’ve thought of this friend frequently over the last year. I’m now at a place where I’m ready to reach out and apologize.

For all I know, he’s forgotten about me and my reaching out may be unwelcome. \n\nDo I call? Email? Text? And how do I put forth a sincere apology without having to share the circumstances of my disappearing? Or do I just leave it alone?",

        "text": "Entering my 30's has come with much healthier boundaries and understanding of healthy relating altogether. And yet I am still struggling to separate myself from the unhealthy dynamics with an ex (40m).\n\nAs women, we're programmed to caretake others. And as a society at large, we're still coming into what it means to have healthy boundaries, know our values, and have compassion/acceptance/tolerance for other's differences. To truly come into what it means to love, not only love for gain / purely individual benefit.\n\nWith this post, I'm hoping for some perspective or reflection from women over 30 who may be able to empathize with the challenges of moving away from someone we love who is suicidal and alone. Or input on whether it's an ethical choice to move away from someone in need or if it is abandoning them.\n\nIt was always unhealthy: Together for 5 years (him emotional cheating with exes, lies, gaslighting, my mental health declining and fighting for him to respect my boundaries in the ways I needed but shaming him for his own preferences instead of respectfully accepting our incompatibility and ending the relationship. I slapped him once, he choked me once). Then 3 years of being \"kind of together\" whereby there was a lot of bread crumbing, he started an \"open\" relationship while telling me he wanted me to see him as his husband and was working towards being with me if we could stop fighting. Told the other woman he and I were nothing more than friends and they were monogamous. Her and I connected 1:1 to share information and this lead to us both breaking it off with him. I know, I know, classically terrible, but we all have to learn.\n\nFrom there, I set myself up with 1-2x weekly therapy, took a leave of absence from work, and went traveling. Invested heavily into self work to heal, identify how I contributed to the unhealthy dynamics, essentially learn to be and do better for myself and those I love. The biggest contributor of this healing process was moving away from him, and a victim mindset to instead take ownership for my own choices (staying with him, fighting for my needs vs accepting the incompatibility and his behaviours). \n\nCut contact with him but he stalked me for a while. Started contact again and honestly I dont even remember when or how that happened. He's been suicidical and deeply mentally ill since then - the breakdowns I've witnessed looked like he was having a stroke. A lot of unhealed trauma in his own mind (childhood abandonment of a parent, other parent's death in 20's, being non monogamous at heart but using deception and manipulation as his strategies vs feeling safe to be open I guess?). This isn't a small case of depression, it's intense mental illness.\n\nHe tells me he has nobody and has shared intense stories about how he has been close to killing himself by hanging and struggles with these thoughts every single day. He is in therapy but he also doesn't seem to be getting any better because \"no therapist can touch the depths of his hardships\". He doesnt' believe in taking medication though once self-admitted to hospital and they gave him anti-anxiety meds. He says he needs to be \"seen and heard\" by me. Last time he went into sharing, it was like he was going to have a stroke it was absolutely TERRIFYING, could barely spit out words and his hands were tense and twisted.. so I told him I can hear him if it helps but it has to be in the company of a therapist. I'm not equipped to be alone in that context. I found someone he approved of, I paid for 3 sessions, but we only had 2 before he decided he doesnt like the person. He talked for 30 mins without pause about how horrible I was in the past and he was angry at the therapist for 'interrupting' him when he asked a followup question. Therapist and I both trying to validate his experience but also shift towards something productive vs spiralling. He tells me he wants to share with me again but only 1:1, and when I reaffirmed why my boundary of needing a therapist is in place, he didn't respond and it has been days of silence.\n\nI'm at a point of needing space to continue my healing. I can't keep spiralling with him. So these days of silence are a bit of an opening - I'm not reaching out every day. I wait 2 days at a time to as \"are you ok\" and it is minimal response, and I imagine I can keep extending the days to create some space for my own mental wellbeing.   \n\n\nAND YET, I feel the guild of not being there to support him, the fear of \"what will he do if he is alone and nobody - me - is there to show him the love he seems to have lost touch with\"? Another part of my mind saying \"I am not responsible for him\", \"I'm still attached and what I'm feeling is the discomfort of cutting those last remaining threads\". A lot swirling inside. \n\nIf you've read this far, thank you. I know it is a lot of information and text! I hope to receive an affirmation that it is ok to take space.. to put me first... because I feel like I'm abandoning someone who is so clearly in need and feels so alone in the world. My heart tends towards wanting to care for others, and I do love this person. I feel so much dissonance.",

I was listening to Oprah’s Super Soul Sunday and she said something along the lines of “it’s always ‘what can life do for me?’ And rarely ‘what can I do for life? For others?” And it really resonated with me and how everything I consume, especially content like tiktok are just full of self-obsession- how to look better, how to make more money, how to get people to do something, where to buy some thing, even wellness and self-improvement advice being disguised as wanting to help viewers but in reality most people just do it for growing their “personal brands.” \n\nNow, I know it’s not black or white, and some stuff is useful. But as I’m getting older, I’m becoming more aware of what I don’t want to participate in. Being self-obsessed, with my life, with my body, with material things…and I’m wondering what I can do to shift my focus. I do struggle with chronic health issues, so for me maybe more than others, trying to figure out how to heal myself was a big part in making me more susceptible to these self obsessed trends and content. I now know, how much it twisted my view or reality, isolated me from others, and how importance balance is.\n\nI have been working on how I show up for those around me. I am trying and will keep working on being more present and finding hobbies that I can work on with others. As someone who isn’t having children anytime soon, I do wonder what activities, maybe books on this topic, or other things I can do to cultivate a less self-focused life?

If it was up to me I would have liked to celebrate it Saturday but he made plans to go to a concert on Saturday and Sunday we have plans for the Super Bowl. I didn’t care to go for Monday or the day of. But I’m kind of upset he made those plans Saturday when we could have celebrate the day with each other. Instead we’ll be celebrating it today briefly at dinner after work. I feel like a brat for being upset about but I just kind of feel like he half assed the dinner plans (he kind of made them last minute too but only because he wanted to do a broadway show and that landed on a work day and it’s too far from us). What are your thoughts.",

Logically, I know this person is a liar, pathetic, broke, a user, abusive, all the things, but all I can think about it how I want him to be exposed within the community he infiltrated. And, he has a pattern of this! He's been: music guy, then coffee guy, then protest guy, and in each situation, he's ended up failing and leaving and has no remaining connections to anyone from these situations. So, this will happen again, right? How can people not see him for who he is when I did and so did his roommate's girlfriend? He's empty inside and always saying how he's so depressed and now? He seems happy. Is this real? Or, will he learn his lesson and be smarter about hiding going forward? \n\nHe never has money. He's always borrowing money. Someone said to me it has to be drugs. While I was out of town, I think he was soon something, because he woke up at 3am and thought his roommate's gf (who got up to let her dog and his dog outside) was their neighbor trying to break into their house. He nearly attacked her, and then never apologized. A week later, he blew up at me out of nowhere. He then worked very hard to get us both out of the equation and cut off all contact with both of us. But, does his roommate notice? No. Wtf?",

        "text": "\\*Trigger warning: death ideation\\*\n\nI got too close to an unstable person and had to reactively pull back from them because I became overwhelmed. The result is pretty bad. How do I do a better at being a friend, without veering into unhealthy territory? How can I do a better job of avoiding becoming the enabling crisis friend to people who actually need professional help?\n\nTL;DR:\n\nThis is coming off the back of a situation with a co-worker who is also a friend. We're both in our 30s and WFH. We live about 100 miles apart and do not meet face to face regularly.\n\nThis friend and I became pretty close over the years after they joined the company. We confide in each other about more than we probably should but I never felt it was a problem until the middle of last year. At first I didn't mind being there for them and I feel sorry for them, but it feels like their life has gone from one catastrophe to the next, culminating last week in them telling me, during work, that they no longer want to exist. \n\nThis really worried me because I had no idea if my friend would act on this feeling or not. I offered to go and see them but they said no. So I reached out to a relative of theirs through social media. I don't actually know any of their family so it was awkward, but I didn't know what else to do. \n\nThe response from my friend was initially one of anger, then acceptance. My friend seems to no longer be in immediate crisis, but still isn't getting help as far as I know. It feels like they don't really understand the magnitude of saying they want to be dead.\n\nThis situation has left me pretty rattled and I've taken a step back, not initiating chat beyond asking them how they are. I realised that I'm their crisis friend and it's interfering with my job and personal life. They confronted me yesterday about how I seem distant and I told them I care about them, but I feel like I'm running on empty emotionally, that I'm not much use to anyone right now, and I need space to sort myself out. I also said I think they need to see a therapist because I feel like they need support beyond what I can offer.\n\nMy friend told me that their perception of what I said was that I was basically abandoning them - they accused me of just not caring about them the way they care about me and said that I made them feel like a burden for seeking support. Their takeaway seems to be that they now think they only cause misery for me and basically think I told them we can't be friends anymore, even though I said nothing remotely like that. They also called in sick from work today. \n\nI'm really at a loss here and what else I can or even should do. This is a fucking nightmare, and I feel like I have bit off WAY more than I can chew in trying to do the right thing.",

I was never very proactive about making friends due to low self esteem and was just thrilled that they wanted to be friends with me. We went to restaurants, uni events, and partied together and I thought we were close.\n\nNow that I'm much older, even though we've stayed in each other's lives to some degree (going on girls' trips, visiting each other, etc.), I am realizing that they don't treat me well at all. For example, last year I had my bachelorette party and at first, S, was soooo excited to come, that cost was no object, and even suggested doing it in Sedona (which is $$$). But when I decided to have it in the city I was living in (to save money), she suddenly wasn't sure and complained about flying/staying in my city being too expensive, after just getting back from a bougie ski trip (she goes on expensive trips all the time). It made me feel like I wasn't worth spending money on. I also once booked a flight to visit her in her city but then she canceled on me because she was going on a trip with a new guy she was dating.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother friend, A, I noticed only reached out when she wants something. She applied to residency recently and had me help her revise a bunch of personal statements and supplemental essays when I myself was really busy (I'm an MD). I was happy to help but then afterwards, she sent a text saying \"I can send you a gift if you want\" which is weird. Why not just send a gift to show you appreciated the help I gave? But then she had me help her brainstorm what gifts to give to the MDs she rotated with (and was hoping to match in their program). Makes me think she only does things if it benefits her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCan anyone relate? How do you move on from feeling naive, used, and letting yourself get treated badly?",
