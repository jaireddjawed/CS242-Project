        "text": "When I realized how abusive my nparents were a few years ago, it started a chain reaction. I quit my salaried, consistent schedule job/career that I was completely burnt out it and pushed to go into by my N's. I spent the next year (almost) doing direct sales to barley pay the bills, spending the time with my one yro (at the time) &amp;amp; clearing out my head and heart. I also continued working on my second Master's Degree for the gelid I've always wanted to work on. Emotionally&amp;amp; mentally it was much needed. Financially it sucked. After the year \"off\" I got an entry level, poor paying, high on experience job in my dream field. I celebrate my year anniversary this week. Unfortunately it pays terribly (like over half of what I made in salary job) &amp;amp; our financial situation has gotten worse &amp;amp; the hours are inconsistent and inconvenient. Fortunately it has given me much needed experience (combined with some clever wording on my resume about my salary job/field) to be eligible for salary jobs in the dream field. \n\nI began to interview for much better jobs (salary, benefits , 9-5, oh my!) and did really well but didn't get them due to my pregnancy (s/n: in the US it's illegal to not hire someone if they're pregnant-it's discrimination- but they don't have to offer FMLA-aka paid maternity leave or even holding your job for your retribution- if you haven't been there a year. So that makes total sense -_-). I'm now 35 weeks pregnant (a week away from 9 months!) and I have a job interview today!!!!\n\nI applied to this organization a month or two ago before I  paused my job search. I got a call a few weeks ago asking if I was interested in an interview. I was very upfront and said \"I am, but I have to tell you that I'm 8.5 months pregnant and I know it's illegal to not hire me, but then you'd have to fire me.\" They said \"that's true\". I continued and said \"if you guys are willing to work with me on a hire date-like after my maternity leave- then I am very much interested in an interview.\" And they scheduled the interview right then!! My husband thinks that means I'm their top pick ;) \n\nEither way, I have this interview today for a job that the salary is very close to my salary job before, with benefits, a regular 9-5 schedule, etc.  all the stability I need back in my life AND it's in my dream field. It's different than what I'm doing now but will add a new niche of experience that will help me reach my end goal dream job. \n\nTL; DR: after 2 years since quitting a well paying but I hated it job &amp;amp; not making ends meet to switch careers, I finally have an interview for a salaried job (near where I was before income wise) in my dream field today. Wish me luck! Send me positive vibes, manifestations, good thoughts, prayers, whatever it is you do please!!!! TIA! \n\nUPDATE: interview went really well. The directly told me that I am a \"desirable candidate\" and that my pregnancy and fast approaching maternity leave is not a problem. They said I checked all their boxes and were very happy. They have a few more interviews this week but hope to make a decision by Friday to get approval from HR. Then that process takes two weeks. So hopefully I'll have great news in 3 weeks. Which I really need bc I had a really unfair and shitty work review today and feel like I suck at everything. That's my next post",

        "text": "Well today I experienced something of a victory.\n\nI stood in front of 12 adults and conducted an English lesson. \n\nNow, this is nothing short of miraculous for me. I was nervous but not overly so.  In the days before NC I would never have done it and if I had had to I would have been a bag of nerves probably to the point of being sick.  \n\nSometimes it’s all doom and gloom on these forums but I want to shout out loud and proud that for me NC has literally saved my life. I have been suicidal, I have been scared and I nearly had a nervous breakdown. I never truly realised the depth of the toxic influence that my parents had over me. They affected everything I did, even if they were not near me. Their voices resounded in my head, telling me to fear everything, and everyone. \n\nCutting contact with my Nparents has had such a profound influence on me. I am growing, I am building the life I dreamed of. I am proud of myself. I feel clever, strong, able and wonderful. I am finally becoming the ‘me’ I should have been. I look forward to continuing to build my life and the exciting adventures on the way.\n\nTo those of you on the beginning of your journey in LC or NC I wish you all the best and tell you in the strongest words possible that to recover and heal is possible. \n",

        "text": "My post history explains my background.\n\nYesterday evening I had a genuinely nice phone catchup with my EParents, both of whom were audibly trying hard not to mention NSis. They know by now that I won't discuss her.\n\nA couple of hours later, I received this email from NSis - my first contact from her since Feb 2015 when I cut her off:\n\n\"Hi s00tball,\n\nI would really like to put what happened behind us. I hate this situation between us life is too short.\nI would really like u to come meet your nephew.\n\nNSis x\"\n\nI've played this out every angle I can think of. The unrealistically hopeful, the truly cynical, back to hopeful... But I just end up seeing it translated something like this:\n\n\"Hi s00tball,\n\nEMum told me how awesome your life is going on the outside, and I miss your constant supply. I want X,Y,Z to happen. I gave birth recently and now have fresh bait for you.\n\nBy writing this, I can prove to EParents that I'm being mature and trying hard to make amends, without actually doing anything. I won't even begin to consider the damage I've caused and that I'd have to understand and want to work to repair our relationship. I won't ever do that of course, I've never done anything wrong. Nothing happened, you're lying and being dramatic again.\nLet's sweep it under the carpet so I don't have to deal with it. And don't you dare bring it up, you broke our family by looking after yourself.\n\nOh but here's a photo of my new baby, your nephew who I'll use as lifelong blackmail (I BEAT YOU TO GIVING OUR PARENTS A GRANDCHILD, HAHA, LOSER!) so you can navigate your way back to me more easily and take you role as scapegoat again.  Respond soon, or I'll organise another smear campaign for you.\n\nNSis x (because I'll always put a kiss on anything, just like the poison texts I sent you before your wedding telling you what a nasty spiteful bitch you are to me and how much you've hurt me since I was little\"\n\n\nNow, there's no way to respond to this and come out of it alright. I hate that but I know it. There's always still a part of me that wishes that adult conversation would happen and she'd want to make a true apology, we could rebuild and I'd meet my nephew and my family would be happy. Unrealistic.\n\nMy guard is up so high, necessarily so, but I feel so horrible for it. I keep wondering \"what if she's trying to mend this, and I'm wrong?\".\n\nBut then, I'll hopefully remember to say fuck that noise. I owe you nothing NSis. I don't owe anyone anything.  My guilt may tell me otherwise, every day of my life. But enough.\n... and then I'm back to hating and isolating myself.\n\nAm I missing anything here, or does anyone have thoughts on this lame first contact?\nAm I being too cynical, and missing something here that might be more innocent? NSis is not a malignant N (but that wouldn't stop her from being totally thoughtless and she tends to be reliably dismissive).\nI'm stuck on looking for the good in this. \n\nIt's ok if not, thanks for listening. I mostly needed it out of my head. \n\nEdit: brain garbage tidy up",

        "text": "I work in what is essentially the service industry, and work with clients for a set period of time, after which they can leave an evaluation. The expected evaluation average is very high, and mine has fallen short of it since I joined the company in September. This has been quite in spite of my best efforts--I've worked very very hard to get it up to par and it has improved dramatically, but it's not quite there and I, being a really awful perfectionist, have been relentlessly self-critical about it.\n\nI've managed to keep my anxiety about this in check with the help of my boss, who has been tremendously supportive and is very good at being critical without being mean. He gets it that I'm trying really damn hard to succeed, and it has been really important (though kind of confusing) for me as an ACoN to be in a situation where an authority figure actually has my back.\n\nBut, of course, all good things must come to an end, and the company transferred him away to a different location at the beginning of the month and brought in a new guy from a different region. The new guy has seemed nice but I've been pretty wary of him for obvious reasons. There have been a few small things he's done that raised some red flags for me, but I've been optimistic in spite of these.\n\nLast week, though, a client gave me a very bad evaluation--one out of five stars--and basically submitted a rant about how terrible I was (I found out later that I'm not the only one she's done this to). My new boss pulled me aside and told me, basically, \"you have to actually put effort into this job, you can't just slack off. Your current evaluation average is crap and I'm going to be keeping an eye on you to make sure you're not fucking up. If you get any more bad evaluations I'll have to take disciplinary actions.\"\n\nAnd since then I've been terrified. It just really hit a nerve to have it be presupposed that I'm not even trying and now I've been freaked out in every session I've had with a client since that they're going to dislike me for whatever reason and I'll get chewed out about it. I've been refreshing my statistics page probably thirty or forty times a day and feeling like I'm punched in the gut if I get even 4 rather than 5 stars. I spent a very large majority of my life with my mother feeling like I'm being stalked for any sign of imperfection or weakness so that I can be either punished or told I'm crazy. I had felt like I was finally free of that, and now I'm right back there.\n\nI've been crying a lot about it, including once in my workspace (and to humiliate me further, my new boss caught me, of course). Some of my other coworkers are very sympathetic, but it's not enough to really help. I, of course, also can't tell anyone what's actually wrong (that I have a lot of distrust for authority figures because I associate criticism with worthlessness thanks to my family) because that's not professional.\n\nI don't know what to do. I just really don't know what to do. I'm pretty desperately hoping that my part time job might offer me a full-time contract (they've indicated that ~more work~ for me is a possibility, and they're sending me on an important business trip soon), but what if that doesn't happen? I need to learn to deal with this but I am doing a really impressively bad job at it, and am feeling like a hysterical idiot about it.\n\nI'm at a total loss. I'd really appreciate any advice anyone could give me.",

        "text": "So I live with an old couple. I'm renting a room in their house, so I never know the etiquette when they have family over, I usually just stay in the room, because I don't want it to be awkward. And plus, I don't really know anyone.  \n\nSo today, they had an event. The father (who's actually a grand father too) two days ago, made it a point to say I'm welcome to mingle at the event today and etc... That his family is nice, and there will be alot of people in the place on Saturday.  He was quite purposeful about it and said I didn't need to stay in my room. So, I tried. I went out when it first started. Some of the usual family members I've seen around were there, so I was sort of just hanging around doing nothing. I said hi to people. Then when I started feeling out of place and just walking around aimlessly, I went back to my room. An hour later, I came out again, I tried saying hi to folks and was introduced to same. But, no one was really that inviting or they didn't know me, so I would just say hi, they would say hi back, and that was it as they would walk to another section of the house. I again sort of felt out of place after a bit, so I left the house and came back to see what would happen. And yeah, same thing. Just awkward for me and nothing really to do as everyone was talking to everyone else they knew. I grabbed some food and then went back to my room. Took a nap as I just had my wisdom teeth extracted and wasn't able to eat most of the catered food. And woke up. And decided to venture outside again, the party was dwindling down at the point. and the Mother was like. \"We were wondering whether you would come out\"... which made me feel bad.  \n\nSo, I don't know. On one hand, I sort of feel bad that I didn't try to stay out for longer even though I didn't really know anyone except the old couple. I probably only was outside for 5 minutes each time I was out there. That may have been considered impolite, because they did basically invite me. And on the other hand, what was I supposed to do? I did venture outside, and try to hang around, but there were only adults, and little kids and high schoolers. No one really my age. Plus, I know the feeling that I'm intruding on something or bothering someone, is probably innately from my childhood. So maybe I should have just tried hanging out there for longer, and find something to do? I have no idea. I'm not really shy around strangers, but if I had to choose standing around doing nothing and out of place or trying to make conversation with the caterer, or going online in my room, I of course would choose the latter. Meh, so what can I learn from this? I know I have problems of feeling unwanted, and maybe that played into this. But, I don't know. Truthfully, I just didn't want to stand around doing nothing or looking out of place amongst this family.",

        "text": "I was sent to live with my Ngrandfather and Egrandmother at the age of five and lived with them until I graduated from High School.  My grandfather was also a lifelong alcoholic and later suffered from a form of dementia.  These things only exacerbated his NPD, and he already displayed *all* of the classic behaviors.\n\nI was a tough kid who had already lived through a *long* first five years.  My father wasn't really in the picture and my mother struggled with a drug addiction.  She gave me up when she went to rehab for one of the many times.  Ngrandfather would ensure that I would never be returned.\n\nWhen Ngrandfather would yell at me, criticize me and abuse me, I would always stand up for myself and fight back.  He was unpredictable and often drunk.  There was no telling when his temper would erupt.  I was quietly diagnosed with PTSD in court ordered therapy, but my Egrandmother was too afraid to say anything to my Ngrandfather.  It got worse as I got older.\n\nAs a teen, I was raped and he yelled at me for that as well, starting as soon as we left the hospital.  A few weeks later, during yet another session of being belittled and yelled at, I snapped.\n\nI told him everything I had ever thought and I held nothing back.  Up until that point, I had simply defended myself, but something changed then and I went on the attack.  I told him he was a bad man, a bad parent, cruel husband and a tyrannical grandparent.  I told him that I pitied him because he was a drunk, angry, unhappy loser.  \n\nHe had a saying that was repeated often, since he was so often at odds with people around the community:  \"There are two types of men, real men and half men!\"  On that day I corrected his quote by adding\"\n\n\"There is a third type and that is no man at all.  That's what you are.  You are no real man.\"\n\nI said many other things and really unloaded on him.  I just *hated* him so much and thought he was absolute scum for treating people the way he did.  Of course he thundered and blustered and I paid for my honestly, but just for a second the N mask slipped.  Just for a second, I realized that he knew that every word I said was true.  Deep down, he knew he treated people terribly.  \n\nThe dynamics of our relationship changed a little, but he was still abusive and cruel until the day he died.  What changed for me was that I realized that this was a full blown personality disorder and that I actually pitied him more than anything else.  It would take years for me to realize how badly damaged and hurt I actually was because it took over a decade for the anger to wear off enough to feel it.  \n\nI have sympathy for my abuser, but I don't make excuses for the behavior anymore.  I was a child.  I did not deserve what happened to me.  No matter what I said or did, I was reacting.  He told me I was a bad person, that I was flawed from birth and that I would always be someone's burden in life.  I realize now that he was talking about himself.",

My relationship with my dad was okay before last year.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI am planning to have my **first EMDR session a day before my next exam** in order to help myself better concentrate for the exam. I tried to schedule it earlier but had difficulties in scheduling.\n\nFor my last two exams, I don't think I was significantly distracted but still want to take EMDR just in case. **I have so far tried meditations and other things to deal with the hurtful things my ndad has said to me.**\n\nAlso while studying for my last two exams, I haven't had much trouble sleeping or nightmares in relation to my ndad, but the other day I had this nightmare involving my ndad. So I believe I might be distracted for my next exam. If necessary, I may have to get the EMDR session and then ask for a make-up exam.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFrom what I understand, EMDR is not for just one-session while the first session or most of the first session may involve preparations for EMDR if the person doing EMDR is not your regular doctor or psychologist, which I think is usually the case.\n\nAccording to [Wikihow, people have to rest after an EMDR session](http://www.wikihow.com/Prepare-Yourself-for-EMDR-Therapy). It also says something about a post-session emotional response.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPlease tell me what I can expect from the EMDR session or what you suggest.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n1. Is my EMDR session not going to be significantly beneficial possibly because the person doing EMDR will likely spend the session asking about me and not doing any actual EMDR and hence I am better off reviewing for my exam?\n\n2. If there is some actual EMDR done, am I going to have to rest for the rest of the day?\n\n3. Might the possibility of a post-session emotional response be a significant reason to postpone starting EMDR until after the exam?\n\n4. Might I have to clarify some more things from the person doing EMDR or her secretary before I go to the EMDR session, if I decide to go?\n\n5. What alternatives to EMDR do you suggest? I have asked [all my doctors](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/48t0vz/is_it_offensive_to_request_my_doctors_to_write_a/) and plan to stick to those in case EMDR may be risky.\n",

        "text": "I know some of you have been following my anxieties s and stressed about my upcoming due date and my recent grandfather's passing. I had a panic  attack about all my anxieties Sunday night. It's been ages since that happened. \n\nSo fast forward into the week &amp; I have a meltdown at my OB appointment (&amp; my awesome midwife just let me cry, offered comfort and suggestions. She even offered to schedule to be at my c section just to be there for me, which she normally wouldn't. That meant the world to me). Midwife suggested I pair back and take the term off from school, volunteering etc. I basically got put on light duty. To work, to dr appts, to home to rest. That's really all I can do being 8.5 months pregnant, exhausted and out of breath all the time (not to mention the pregnancy insomnia and terrible heartburn and stomach issues). So I headed her advice and withdrew from this term-which was a first for me and a hard choice. \n\nSo, I posted on fb about how frustrating and overwhelming my limitations have become and how they're just getting worse. I talked about having to pair back and how hard that is. I also said that all help was welcome, from cleaning my house to bringing over dinner to putting laundry away to playing with my toddler so I can nap, every little by helps. And that was hard for me to put out there. It's been hard for me to do this basically on our own since I'm NC and my BFF lives cross country. We have limited support and resources. \n\nThe response was overwhelming. I had friends text me love and well wishes. I had other friends schedule when they can either bring us dinner or come over to help. One friend came over today to help and I only expected her to help clean up my toddlers toys or put laundry away but SHE CLEANED MOST OF MY HOUSE! My BFF bought me a prenatal massage. Another dear friend hired a professional cleaning lady to come and DEEP CLEAN my house next week. I'm beyond humbled by all this generosity and love- all with no strings attached. I can't help but to think that I've been a good enough friend to them-just by being myself- to have this happen. It was so beyond unexpected. \n\nI have a hard time accepting generosity with out feeling like I owe something in return. So I'm working on that (though some of these friends are so getting Starbucks gift cards!!). It really has been a gift to me and my family. By my friend cleaning up , it's huge for us. She gave my poor-been-running-on-E-for-months husband a night off. He was asleep by the time I got home and hasn't budged (I work evenings). He hasn't slept that deeply in months. That's an amazing gift she's given me and my family. Hopefully that will alleviate some of the stress that's been on us and our marriage so we can get back to us. \n\nI'm just so humbled by the genuine authenticity and love of these people in my life. It helps a lot with the feelings of being alone!!!! ",

I generally don't look at people's FB pages but I have too much time on my hands these days.  And I was kind of wondering why my sister was keeping quiet, even by our LC standards.\n\nSo there was a lot of stuff about what a wonderful caring woman this aunt was, but that wasn't my experience.  She was never unkind to me, but she never offered any help when I was going through some very rough stuff.  (Like being locked out of the house at night as a teenager by my father - her brother.)  I can't remember the last time I had any contact with her but it was at least 25 years ago.\n\nSo, that happened.\n\nIt also looks like my sister's relationship ended.  So that is probably another factor in her silence.  I can't say this to her of course but THANK GOD.  The guy was scum and I did NOT like the idea of him being around my 12-year-old nieces.  \n\nNo real point to this post, I guess.  It just felt weird to find out all this big info this way.\n",

        "text": "College was the worst experience of my life. I had a solid two years where it was okay and I made some friends, but that quickly dissipated when mental health issues emerged around the time where, when I was 20, I rose to become the \"man of the house\" (I had my shit more together than my 63 year old father, at age 20) and I went home to focus on school, commute, and save money, while I took the hardest classes available at an undergrad level and mediated my parents' divorce. It was the worst. My mother parentified me and I very often feel like her surrogate husband, or boyfriend, or father. She's not really a mother to me anymore, and even getting a text from her kills my libido from how stereotypically \"naggy girlfriend\" it is. Kids would come back from breaks and rub how fun their lives were in my face. Now it's over, I have a generic marketing job near my hometown, and I'm shelling half my monthly paycheck to live near the city, walking distance to the metro. I'm letting my brain heal, saving money and seeing a therapist to plan my next big step in life.\n\nCollege was not intentional nor was it really in my hands. My parents fucked it up for me. They didn't prepare me in high school so I didn't get into any okay schools, and the ones I did go to, they pretty much used me to meet their emotional needs, so it's not like I ever had a stable backdrop against which to paint my life. Those last two years of college were a violent hell, and I would rather kill myself than to repeat them. That being said, I am now a far more resilient person and I know how much I can handle before breaking, so I feel like I can undertake something massive and become very successful, because most of my life has been rejection and pain, and being able to withstand that shit is an asset.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions on how to 'live it up?' It pains me that I'll never get to have a normal, fun college experience where I could branch out and make connections, but now I just want to chill the fuck out for a little bit and live like a bohemian until I advance my career. I don't think I can move past this stage in my life. I need to just hang out and have fun, make friends and stuff. I feel so goddamn isolated and I just want a taste of that youthful fun before all of my hair falls out.\n\nDoes anyone have any sort of experience with this? Being able to live it up and have a good time after college? I want to move to a cheap city and start a band, and just do that for a while before I get tired of it.\n\n**Edit** I'm sorry if I have triggered anyone with this post, or anything like that. My intention was not to make anyone else feel worse. Getting some perspective with some of the comments on this post helps. Thanks, all.",

If I could deliver the box, he would follow 5 minutes later. I figured, sure no problem and delivered the box. It turned out the birthday girl was not a young girl (somehow I got the impression it was for a young girl as the man said there was a balloon in the box), but a middle aged woman. She was quite surprised and happy to receive the box, saying it was her birthday. I left, signaled the man that I had delivered the box and then went on to my job interview thinking I had done something nice, because birthday surprises are nice, right?\n\nLater on I started to think, what if that man was someone's creepy Ndad? This would be a typical N-thing to do: solicit the help from a helpful stranger, because birthday surprises are nice, right?\n\nI have no idea whether this was a nice family member trying to surprise that woman or a creepy N bothering her.

        "text": "I have posted a lot about this baby coming soon (4-6 weeks now!). This weekend my goal was to get some of the things done off my list to help feel less anxious. I realized the other day that, since going NC with my nfamily almost two years ago, there are somethings I am \"missing\" this time around. My n/emother was a baby nurse, so when I had my son, she was there (and it was one of the few times she actually was a Mom). If I didn't have something we needed, she bought it for us. When I was scared and going into shock post c-section, she was there explaining everything to me which calmed me down, while my husband attended to our newborn. She went into the nurse role and took care of me. She helped us prep for the baby and get everything we needed bought and taken care of. She then stayed with us for a week or two and helped us adjust to the newborn (which of course, I know fed her ego and needs, but it was still super helpful to have an RN on call in our living room whose speciality was newborns). \n\nDon't get me wrong, I wouldn't go back to them if they were the last people on earth. I'm just sitting here trying to go through everything and get the nursery ready and I am just overwhelmed and sad. I can't physically do anything because I am so pregnant. My husband is beyond exhausted himself and having a hard time regulating his emotions (so unlike him, but it's been his norm the last few months because of the stress), I have this huge list of things we need that we have no money for (can't even pay my car payments this month...), and every plan we have to make this nursery nice and thrifty keeps falling through. Its enough to make me sit and cry. And then I try to pack the diaper bag for the hospital and realize all these cute Newborn clothes I have she will never wear because they are estimating 10 lb baby and newborn covers 5-8lbs. \n\nThe one thing I do  have is an over abundance of clothes, but I don't have the other necessities that I need and no money to get them. My MIL is helping as she can, but its so different. She isn't my mom, so I have no idea what to expect in ways of support. My husband is supposed to talk to her, but keeps forgetting and I keep getting more and more anxious. I don't have much support here. My BFF lives across the country and can't fly out like originally planned. I don't want to add more to my husband's list to do because he is already stretched thin. \n\nI am just feeling very sad and overwhelmed.\n\nUpdate: so I updated below about my breakdown at my midwife's today and how she encouraged me to drop my courses this term and pair down everything except work and rest. So I did. I posted on FB about this and how hard it's been to come to this realization. I also said I'm unable to do pretty much anything and I would welcome any help people can give, ranging from house cleaning to just bringing us dinner. I've had a few friends reach out. One is coming to help with laundry and some cleaning, my BFF got me a prenatal massage and my other friend is gonna hire a maid to clean my house bc she lives 3 hours away and can't come help like she wants. I'm so humbled and grateful. I wasn't looking for handouts. I just shared that I/we need help and people came through. Helps to not feel so alone. ",

        "text": "One of the side-effects of growing up with a narcissist is internalizing their criticisms as an inner voice which speaks about everything that you do and everything that happens to you. Everytime you screw up, it's because you're an idiot, or you never do anything right, or you're a fuck up and everyone else is a paragon. However in most people who take care of themselves, there is a sense of self-awareness, knowing when they are doing something or forming a habit that does not benefit them.\n\nTo the point, I can't discern the difference and it is driving me crazy. To provide context, I am a junior in college who is proceeding well on his degree path, could do better, but could also certainly be doing worse. While I have an interest in finding other hobbies, the only ones I pursue anymore are video games and watching Youtube channels. I had friend groups at the outset of college which fell to pieces after a split, and since then have had just a few friends, some of which have also had less contact. \n\nIn all of this, I believe I am at fault for something. For my hobbies I can't tell if videogames are an enjoyment or an anesthetic, a way of passing the hours and procrastinating work away so that I don't have to feel inadequate in my schoolwork or feel isolated from my peers. For my friends, I believe that I am not a good enough friend or an interesting enough person to make new relationships or maintain the ones I have. No friend of mine is particularly close, and I sincerely doubt I could ever confide anything about my troubles (not that anyone would really want to hear them and hey I don't blame them). **I cannot tell if the way I am living my life needs to change or if the way I think about myself needs to.** I just feel completely and utterly inadequate, and I do not know if A). It's all mental and I am holding myself back from the person I am fully capable of being, or B). I am actually doing well in my circumstances and am being too hard on myself. Despite being given advice about not thinking of myself as inadequate, I look around and see other people doing more than I and I can't help but feel as though *I am simply making an excuse for why I am not doing more*. Why I am not exercising, why I am not on top of my education. Why I am not going to parties and socializing. Anytime my therapist says I should think *I am enough*, my mind responds with *That's an excuse*. Because I lack an objective lens, I was hoping posting here and hearing some other experiences could put some of this into perspective. Thanks for taking the time to read, hope it was clear what I was talking about.\n\nTl;dr: I cannot tell whether I should be less hard on myself for not doing more, or if I would be just giving myself an excuse.",

He scared my friends away, and alienated me from them to the point I was also bullied at school. His family encouraged him and told me I was wrong to try and cut him out. I hate them all.\n\nLast year I had a beautiful little girl. I promised myself then that I would never speak to any of them again. My decision was confirmed to me to be the right one when they refused to spell my daughters first name right (her names Isobel, they spell it Isabelle/Isabel) and called me morbid for giving her my late grandmothers (mums side) first name as her middle name (it is infact a beautiful name when paired with her first name, but of course I am biased). They also don't like the fact that I gave her my partners surname, instead of mine - he is her dad, and I'm marrying him in 2 weeks and changing my name to his.\n\nI moved to the other side of town to get away from them, for ages they made verbal threats to me against me, my partner and my daughter (always denied to the police) and constantly called Social Services saying we were neglecting our daughter.\n\nJust after Christmas this all died down to me just hearing comments about what they'd said through my brother/mother, and I thought they'd finally got the hint that I didn't want anything to do with them when I refused to open the Christmas present they sent to my daughter (incorrect spelling of her name again and used the wrong surname) and didn't acknowledge them when I saw them in the local supermarket.\n\nBut it all kicked off again a few weeks ago. When I heard from my brother that they knew where and when I am getting married (probably thanks to him) and are planning to turn up because they have the right to be there apparently. And the phone calls to Social Services have started up again when I was spotted in town with just my partner as my baby was with a very good friend who was allowing my partner and I to have some time together.\n\nI just wish they'd leave me alone. I was at the point where I was considering possibly letting my dad ONLY having supervised access to my daughter, then my mum told me that despite me saying he was never to meet her that he's met her. I left her with a now ex-friend (EF) when she was about 6 weeks old, she ended up with concussion and EF wouldn't tell me what happened, probably because I'd said \"DO NOT LET MY DAD ANYWHERE NEAR HER\" and I reckon something happened when he was around.\n\nI am never ever letting him near my daughter again. I'm just ranting here. I know that I should move out of my town but I love it here apart from them, and I don't want to be forced out of my home because of them.\n\nI just hope they don't turn up to my wedding and they realise that by not being invited I want nothing to do with them, AT ALL.",

He was angry all the time. The one time my (GC) brother and I talked about this, my brother said it was like he was constantly drunk but without the alcohol. He was horrible to everyone but I got the worst of it. It got so bad that other family members commented on it (which is almost in flying pigs territory).\n\nAt some point, my mother (who is an N in her own right and also an E) persuaded him to go to the doctor about his anger issues. I have no idea how she managed to do that. But this stupid bloody idiot of a doctor said: \"Oh, everyone gets angry. I know I blow my top sometimes!\" \n\nThis was the one opportunity anyone has ever had to get Ndad to do something to change his behaviour. This is, to my knowledge, the only time he's ever acknowledged that his behaviour might not be okay. AND THE STUPID IDIOT SAID IT WASN'T A PROBLEM. So he never did that again. \n\nThis was also the one time my mum actually admitted to a third party that my dad's behaviour wasn't okay and asked for help. She never did that again, either. \n\nI'm sure the LAN folk will understand how unfathomable it was that Ndad even went to the appointment and had that conversation in the first place. \n\nOkay, so it was the 90s and there was less awareness of stuff like domestic violence but I don't care about all the excuses there might be for that doctor and how badly he let us all down. I don't care about the fact that maybe nothing would have helped or it might have made him worse. I just feel letdown. ",

I feel like some of the abuse I suffered under the Nmum there was worse than that of my own Nmum, and worse because I had been taken in and so when she abused me I felt like I had to let her. For example the Nmum used to play me and her own damn daughter off each other for GC status like we were puppets to be played. I paid my way and did all the chores, and did *everything* I could for the family. It was absolutely f**cked. \n\nAfter escaping that and being NC with all of them, I now have a life, and am renting a house and getting on with things. I even have a healthy romantic relationship! Life is great now.\n\n*But*\n\n\nI got an 'anonymous' message from the aforementioned friend saying that they missed me but I was 'not forgiven' and it sent me into a rage. I wrote up a reply which included many things, such as links to these N subs, saying that they can get help here, too, and that they didn't have to put up with the abuse they suffer, and that I and several others have been quite concerned for a long time about the insipid, controlling scum that is their mother. It had a lot of other things in it, too. Nothing too bad, but I stood up for myself to them for once. I did keep in mind the terrible situation that person is in, too, and offered my help should they ever want help escaping. \n\n\nNow, I knew this response would reach the family, and that's fine. The Nmum in particular has Histrionic Personality Disorder. She likes to talk a lot of shit about me to anyone and everyone who will listen and even made posts on facebook about me. (She took me in in the first place so I could be ego fodder, I discovered) What she doesn't realise is that she's friends with several people who are closer with me than to her and that they care for me more, so they pass things on including screenshots of the things she says or they bring up the posts she makes on social media just to keep me in the loop of what people are hearing about me.\n\n\nBasically, I want to tell the N that while I have moved on, if she has anything to say about me that she should say them either to me privately through something like facebook, or if she simply can't have people not focussing on her every minute of every day, that she at least have someone tag me in the posts she makes about me because I hear about every single thing she even says in passing anyway and it is unfair that she continues her public tirade without giving me a chance to respond on the public posts she makes. (I mean come on, public social media drama is an N's *dream* isn't it?)\n\n\nI really have moved on, but I want to hold her responsible for the things she says and does. The only way I have on contacting her is through her business facebook page. I was thinking about privately messaging it rather than feeding the monster and posting publicly. I basically just want to drop her a few lines saying that everything she says about me reaches me and that if she has anything to say she ought to say it *to* me, and that if she wishes for it to be public discussion, I won't entirely engage and feed her ego, but I will emphasise my presence to her audience.\n\n\n\n\nIs that a reasonable thing to do? How should I deal with this?",

I did not do this because I didn't feel I owed my Nmom anything and up until going NC I had done everything in my power to try and get her to understand the hurt/pain/abuse she caused me.

It's there. So I thought I would put it out there to all you who have gone NC and see how you went about it.\n\n**UPDATE:**\nJust wanted to send a thanks to all of you for your kind words and support. I never fails to bring me out of my funk of doubt and guilt when I can find compassion, understanding and validation here. I will continue to press onwards with NC, reminding myself that my choice to go NC and HOW I chose to go NC was in the best interest for me and should I ever be in the position where a letter or conversation is necessary - I will cross that bridge when I get to it.

I've noticed that they get worse when I'm super stressed. The week my grandfather died, I think I had 2 or 3. Two weeks later, when I got the \"check yes or no to reconcile\" letter from my nfather, I had them every night for 3 or 4 days straight. \n\nThey all have a theme too. It's typically some dark shadow/being/monster standing over the side of my bed entirely too close and about to touch or grab me. Sometimes there are other things \"flying around\" ready to fall/land on me. I usually wake up screaming when the monster reaches out and/or the things descend. Sometimes it's bugs. I woke up the other night thinking the wall was covered in spiders. Had to blink a few times to make them disappear. \n\nI'm not sure what the consistent themes mean. I just know that I get them when I'm stressed and/or anxious and it's been a helluva month. The closer I get to my due date, the worse it gets too. \n\nDoes anyone else have similar experiences or insights? Makes me wonder if something happened to me as a kid (someone standing over me too close/violating me?) that I just don't remember. 80% of my childhood is a blur, so I've often wondered what my brain is hiding from me... Or maybe it's just symbolic of the emotional/mental abuse? ",

        "text": "One of the most popular forms of healing from abuse (or any trauma) is journaling.  There is something about getting it all down on paper (or on the computer – just in some readily accessed form other than in your head) that provides relief from the tension held in the memories and allows some processing in an overwhelming situation.  I haven’t seen this journaling process clearly explained in terms of working memory (although it’s not an original thought, so probably someone has) but I just wanted to share this information so y’all can understand the neuroscience behind it (or at least, my take on linking the journaling to the neuroscience).  \n\nWorking memory consists of the few temporarily active thoughts in your consciousness, or what can be kept in mind at one time.  The limit according to current research is 3-5 items.  These are the items that the mind uses to make decisions from moment to moment, day to day.  Abuse victims often have A LOT of memories that could potentially inform them of how bad their situation is/was, but working memory can only hold so many of those memories in mind while the victim is making decisions regarding their situation.  And because no rational person wants to believe they are or were being abused, conflicting information is usually being held in mind as well, crowding out the bad memories.  \n\nSo, writing everything down is basically a brain hack to get around the limits of working memory, and allows people to review a lot more information at one time regarding a situation.  This process is mainly what helped me figure out that I was in an abusive marriage, that I had a psycho roommate that I had to get away from, and even that my childhood was abusive (this last with considerable assistance from RBN/LAN – thanks everyone!).  I didn’t want to believe any of these things, but seeing it all on paper helped verify what my intuition had long been telling me – that those various situations were really bad for me and I needed to get away/stay away from them.  \n\nI have found that writing down all the bad memories/proof of abuse has considerably eased a great deal of mental tension; writing it down relieved the stress of trying to keep it in mind.  I think the tension resulted from the self-protective part of me desperately wanting me to NOT forget the bad stuff, and so it just kept pushing it into working memory until I wrote it down.  \n\nOf course, this is helpful just in general situations too, which is why a frequently offered piece of advice when needing to make a difficult decision is to make a pro/con list of everything relevant to the decision.  \n\nTL;DR:  Your brain can only hold so much information at any one time, so if you need to process a lot of information, it really helps to write it all down so you can work around this memory limitation.  \n\nHere is an excellent paper on working memory if you want to read up on it further:  \nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2864034/\n",

        "text": "I haven't posted about my meditation experiment this week, as I had a big flare up of my illness and haven't been able to do anything. I have been meditating daily, but the focus is more on calming myself and coping with this illness - so I've not felt like writing about it. \n\nAnyway, I had a big argument with SO last week, and straight after my illness flared up again, big time. I'm really struggling right now. I'm so angry with SO, but I'm totally reliant on him at the moment because I can't even cook for myself - I need him to do almost everything for me. \n\nThe argument last week was about cleaning and household chores generally. After 3 weeks of me being completely bedridden, our flat was disgusting, messy and dirty. There were no clean clothes, towels or bed linen, the fridge was dirty and there was no food in it. We've had this conversation many times before: \"SO, please do your share of the chores\" and he'd agree and things would change for a week, and then I'd be back to doing almost all the housework myself - until I snapped and we'd have the same sometimes-conversation-sometimes-argument again. \n\nExcept this time around, I am so sick I literally can't do my own chores, or his for him.  So I raised this, and we had quite a good conversation - and I felt like he finally got it. He finally understood that it wasn't fair for me to do 80% of the housework, and he stopped acting like I wasn't just being 'fussy' or 'OCD\" about the chores, he finally understood they need to be done or we can't eat, sleep, wear clean clothes etc. \n\nTogether we wrote out a list of all the household chores - and he said he would come up with a rota to share them equally. But he would do more/all of the chores until I'm well again. He then cleaned the whole flat, and did the laundry. For the first time ever. So far so good, and I started feeling better actually - I was feeling optimistic that I would get well again, and that SO was going to support me through this time. \n\n1.5 weeks later, and SO hadn't done any further chores, and the Rota/Schedule for Chores that he was going to write hadn't been done. I start feeling really upset about this - probably overly so because of FLEAS and flashbacks to abandonment feelings? - while he was out at work I got really really upset about the trash and the recycling. He hadn't taken it out for 1.5 weeks and he knows its hard for me. It was literally overflowing into the cupboard the trash cans are kept in. I got myself really upset and freaked out and felt so ANGRY with him - I've got a heart condition and he can't even take the trash out!?!?! I threw all the recycling on the kitchen floor and kicked one of the cans til the side split.  Then I cried for a while. Then I debated throwing it all on his desk. Then I thought better of that, and carefully picked it all up and put it back in the right cans and took it out. Which was all physically very HARD on my body. I should have just left it. \n\nWhen SO came home from work I was livid - and I can't tell if justifiably so or if this was FLEAS or a bit of both. I'm really really bad at dealing with my anger - I didn't want to speak to him about it, I just wanted him to fix the problem - not very logical I know. He said \"I can tell your angry about seomthing, do you want to talk to me about it - there isn't a right or wrong way to talk about it, you can just talk to me\". So I tried to explain how I was feeling, and how I was so optimistic that he'd finally understood and was going to do his share of the chores, and I was so disappointed that a week and a half later nothing had changed.  I could tell he was really angry about this. I asked him how he was feeling, and he told me \"Sometimes I wonder if you're always just looking for something to be upset about - that there will always be something you freak out over, first it was 'breaking' up with your therapist, then it was your manager who was bullying you, now it is the cleaning - maybe you just always need a problem in your life to get upset about. I'm getting so sick of it. It's not fun.\"  I didn't respond, I just brought the conversation to an end. \n\nAs you can imagine I was pretty devastated by this statement. I managed to sleep that night, trying not to think about it. The next day, I did a bunch of online tests for Borderline, Histrionic etc. wondering if maybe I am some kind of drama-addict and I do just manufacture these problems. I came out as 'unlikely' for most and 'mild' for a couple of areas. So I think it's pretty unlikely that I am. \n\nThings with SO have been strained since then, and my health has deteriorated again to the point that I can't even cook for myself, and getting out of bed is hard work and I can only sit up for a few minutes.  It's pretty bad. I rely on SO completely to do everything for me. I can't tell if my anger with him is legitimate or FLEAS or a bit of both. \n\nI now feel like every time I ask him to do something for me, I'm being a huge burden to him. (He also works long hours in a very demanding job, and he's only been in this new role for 5 months. So he's going through a tough time right now too.)  So I only ask for things I absolutely need, but then I have to ask 3 or 4 times and keep reminding him to go to the store, or do the laundry or whatever.  I'm getting really frustrated and I can't understand why he can't plan and figure out for himself how to keep food on the table, clean clothes in the drawers, and run the hoover round and clean once a week. I don't think these things are so hard - yet he's acting like its this huge deal. \n\nThank goodness his Mom, who is amazing, has come to visit for a few days. Today she has cleaned the kitchen, done our laundry, hoovered, made me breakfast, she'll take me to the Dr in a bit, and then she's going to the supermarket for us. She's so incredibly kind. She's amazing. I feel so lucky she is here. \n\nI'm feeling so confused right now. SO is being very caring and kind in his words, and giving me lots of hugs, and he bought me cakes yesterday, but I'm stuck at home all day in a messy flat and I have to remind him constantly to buy food/do laundry etc, and I feel like such a horrible nagging woman.  It makes me feel like a huge burden, which also makes me angry, and feeling like a burden is triggering abandonment feelings and mild flashbacks. At the same time as me sturggling with this heart condition which should have improved by now, but really hasn't and I'm starting to feel really worried I won't get better (I've read some people just don't).  I need SO to take responsibility and take care of me. I've asked him if he can take compassionate leave from work, so he'll have time to look after me and cook me meals, he says he can't, but he has arranged to work from home a few days next week - I don't think that's going to be enough though. I made a simple lunch for myself yesterday, and that was so hard on my body I had to lie still on the sofa for 4 hours after that until the pain passed. \n\nHow do I deal with this?  Is this FLEAS, am I over-reacting to SOs behaviour? Should I keep on trying to get him to understand? (Every time I even mention a chore now he looks angry).  \n\nI'm feeling like I want to break up with him when this is all over (please let me get well again, please).  I want to be with someone who I feel has got my back, who is going to be there for me, not only when I'm fit and healthy, but when things go wrong too. But maybe this is a FLEA too, and I'm over-reacting?  \n\nYou guys! Please talk some sense for me.  SO is the only person I see on a regular basis right now because I can't leave the house. I need some fresh perspectives. \n\nApologies for wall of text. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n",

To the point of shutting my office door at work, laying under my desk, and pouring tears for an hour. \n\nShe’s expecting to see me tonight, and I don’t know how to get my head back on straight. How do you guys process these things?\n",

I held strong and only recently contacted the shitbag to try and help my mother keep her power on, as she was unaware my father had told them to shut off services completely. It was a brief conversation and when he said he \"couldn't help\" I didn't argue, just hung up. Luckily, I work for our local power company and was able to keep the power on for my mom and younger brothers. I haven't spoken to him since.\n\nSaturday night, the most amazing thing happened. After almost five and a half years of dating, my boyfriend proposed to me!! Before posting the news on instagram where I am friends with some family members on my father's side, I blocked his number for both texting and calling, so he wouldn't be able to contact me and I could bask in the love and happiness of it without hearing it from him. But now, even without hearing from the shitbag, he's still managed to ruin my happiness. \n\nBefore we even got engaged, I knew I did not want my father at our wedding. Because of this, I decided not to invite extended family on his side, as they would question me either before, DURING, or after as to why I did not invite my father. I've considered a small ceremony only, small ceremony and small reception, and a small ceremony and large reception. The last option is the preferred, but I would feel guilty not inviting my family, but inviting friends. \n\nIt's shitty having this black cloud threatening to smother out the glow of this amazing occasion.

So I wanted to update everyone.\n\nI had my OB check up today and I just said \"I have a serious question. I have family members who are abusive...\" and he said \"Say no more. You won't see them.\" They then explained that when I go in for delivery, they will ask and I can give them a list of people who are not allowed to visit. They will enforce it since it is a locked ward and people now have to go to L&amp;D to check in (it used to be down stairs for all wards). They have to have my name, room number, and give their full name. So that was really reassuring. They didn't even seem ruffled by my request. I just told my OB that I appreciated it and wanted to make sure he knew what was going on/on board since my nfamily likes to maximize the damage they do when they do it. He completely understood. He said \"We have you protected at the hospital.\" So that was awesome.\n\nMy check up went otherwise well and they are estimating a BIG baby (which my guess of 10lbs seems to be accurate....we make them big apparently! HA!) and he said everything is looking good. \n\nJust wanted to share the update. You guys have been keeping this very pregnant mama calm over the last month or so with all this craziness and anxiety with my nfamily. Oh-and in other good news, I finally found a new therapist and can start going back weekly starting next week (my old one-whom I LOVED- didn't take my new, crap insurance and Ive barely been able to see her at the discounted rate over the past year. So, while Ill miss her, Im happy to get regular therapy again). So good news all around.\n\nThanks and love to all!!  ",

        "text": "I had a dream my parents got back together, had another kid, and then promptly killed him. In the dream I couldn't decide if the death was an accident, or if there was really malicious intent behind it. \n\nIn real life, I have lost a sibling at a very young age. My mom says she died of health complications, which could very much be 100% correct. But at the time this all went down, my mom was also obsessed with the movie The Safety Of Objects, in which a narcissist mother kills her comatose son. So, I've always been suspicious to say the least. I've talked to my therapist about this, and he assured me that because of the age of my sibling when she passed, there would have been an autopsy that could have shown any foul play. Asides from that, she was cremated so I'm not sure there would be any way for me to prove anything. So for that most part, I am trying to put that to rest and move on.\n\nAnyway, I had that horrible dream that brought those feelings back up. I woke up from it, and as I laid in bed trying to calm down, I decided I'd check Facebook. I had a notification that my mom had tagged me in a post. So I went to check it out.\n\nNow, some background on my mother. She is obsessed with a band and it's lead singer. She spends most of her money on it, travels all over to see them, etc. It frustrating because she lives off of disability and in poverty and with my 5 younger siblings.\n\nSo I see this notification from my mother and I go to check it out. The singer she is obsessed with is playing a show in my state. I live on the other side of the country from her. I've sent mail to my siblings, I've posted photos on Facebook with my location attached. I've mentioned the city I live in, the area, etc a number of times on Facebook. She knows what city I live in, or the very least what area. So she posts on my wall asking me if the show this singer is playing at is close to me at all. Its on the other end of the state. I live in a large state. I am at one end, and this show is at the other end completely. \n\nThis is something she could have easily looked up. All she needed was the knowledge of where I live, and where the show is, and Google Maps. I know she could have looked it up. Instead she asked me. \n\nOk, whatever, maybe she is trying to have a conversation with me? So I brush that part off. \n\nBut is this her way of hinting at maybe visiting? Because her favorite singer is going to be in the same state. I've been living here a year, and she has never even considered visiting. But now, her favorite singer is putting on an $8,000 show and she wants to visit so she has a place to crash in between trying to stalk this poor singer. \n\nIt's.... aggravating. It's angering. She never saw our house back home. Never cared to visit. I guess her home was close enough to stalk him so she didn't need my home. \n\nWhile it was annoying, and somewhat ironic, to wake up from my dream of my shitty family to my mother again showing me how little she cares, it is also a great reminder of why I remain VLC.

The place where I am a giant sack of sh*t and the world would probably be better off without me. And I’m really struggling.\n\nI’m a SAHM to a young toddler, but I also working part time from home. I have a lot of responsibilities right now and I’m doing a pretty good job keeping up with the “stuff” that needs doing. But that’s one of my coping mechanisms, to do do do until I exhaust myself. Otherwise, I haven’t been a very good human lately. I’ve been too harsh with the toddler, angry with the cats, snappish with my husband, and enraged with my therapist. And no one has done anything to deserve such anger. One part of me can see that, but I still feel so much rage.\n\nSo I wonder, what if my Nmom, Edad, and N/FM siblings were right all along? What if I really am a horrible person? And a big part of me believes that right now. Another part of me keeps saying how much easier it would be for everyone if I just disappeared. My toddler wouldn’t be so whiney and the cats would be happier. My husband wouldn’t get rejected when he tries to touch me. And my therapist wouldn’t have to pretend to care anymore. Because, really, who wants to listen to me cry about my childhood “trauma” again and again? I’m so very sick of myself.\n\nMy therapist keeps telling me this is my PTSD, that I’m triggered, that it’s normal and I’ll get back to a good place soon. Last session she told me I have a lot of trauma to work through. But is that really the truth? Maybe I just made all of this up. Maybe, as Nmom always said, I’m making up stories and creating drama for attention. Which would, again, point to the fact that I suck.\n\nI’m tired of this. I think that I’ve made progress in nearly two years of therapy only to find myself back here over and over. Maybe that’s because this is the truth and I should stop fighting it.

We exchanged greetings, she very quickly saw that I wasn’t interested in talking to her, her face fell, and she left immediately.  \n\nI could barely focus on getting the few groceries I needed and getting out of there.  I felt overwhelmingly guilty for being cold to her.  I went NC with her and Nbro almost 3 years ago, long before I found RBN/LAN, or could acknowledge to myself that I had a (covertly) abusive childhood and all the related C-PTSD health problems from it.  I have had no reason to regret NC, but RBN/LAN has been a Godsend in helping me figure it all out and realize I did the right thing.  (I went NC when Nbro attacked me and Nmom sided with him, and she paid for his lawyer when I filed for an emergency order of protection.  So then I had to lawyer up too, and that all came out of my pocket, which I could ill afford.  The judge dismissed my request for a 2 year plenary OOP in no small part because Nbro had a decent lawyer, and the judge believed Nbro’s bullshit story about why and how Nbro laid hands on me - because Nbro thought I was getting ready to attack him, and he just pushed me down into a chair to defend himself.)  \n\nThe logical side of me is saying I did the right thing, that this is what I had long resolved to do if this ever happened, that I have a lifetime’s worth of experience as proof that I have nothing to gain from re-establishing contact.  The emotional side is screaming “She was nice to you!  She was happy to see you!  She’s not all bad!  Maybe it would have been ok, maybe she's learned her lesson and you could have a relationship again!  She loves you!  You hurt her and she didn’t deserve it!”  IT IS TEARING ME UP BECAUSE I HURT HER AND DISAPPOINTED HER.  \n \nI feel like I have a bunch of angry guilt-trip wasps buzzing around in my head and stinging me in the feels, and I want to bang my head against a wall until they stop.  Seriously, I want to bang my head against the wall – anything to distract me from this horrible tension and pain. I would appreciate any hugs or words of support.  Thank you.  \n",

        "text": "Ok so I've been posting a lot about my upcoming delivery and how to protect myself at the hospital from my nfamily (NC almost 2 years). You guys had GREAT advice. So I'm reaching out again for your thoughts. \n\nIn the state of Va, a cop friend told me I could send a certified letter to my nparents that states they are not allowed on my property and would be considered trespassing if they came to my home. He said this would put a warrant out for their arrest if they came to my house. He also said that bc it's a certified letter that they have to sign for, it counts as papers being served. ( s/n it Would be great if I could put a \"keep 100 yards a way\" part in there but I doubt that's possible!)\n\nAnyways, I haven't done this since he told me about it last year. I've been keeping it in my back pocket until they did show up at my house (I have a plan for that). The main reason is because I don't want it to come across as an out of the blue attack and provoke the beast. I have felt more comfortable having it as a defense reaction if that makes sense. Plus in the 2 years I've been NC, I've not responded to ANYTHING. None of the emails, texts, phone calls or the most recent letter. I've run into my e/nmother a few times (we live in the same town) &amp; kept the interaction minimal of at all. I have not officially told them that I'm never speaking to them again. Ever. I'm not giving them the satisfaction of playing the victim. They can live in uncertainty. \n\nAnyways, now that the baby is due soon (8 weeks!!!) I'm trying to prepare and take precautions. Since N's like to attack at the most vulnerable/most stressful times, I want to protect myself and family. (My nfather and ngrandma chose my grandfathers recent death to try to suck me back in. They failed, but classic example of n timing). I'm gonna be wrecked from the c section and new baby, dealing with my nparents &amp; GC nbro &amp; his BPD wife is the last thing I want. So that's why I'm considering sending the \"no trespassing letter.\"  Just not sure if I want to deal with \"poking the beast\" while things are kinda quiet at the moment. And it would be the first \"response\" I've given them in 2 years. I feel like it may encourage them to show up at the hospital. \n\nSo any advice and thoughts are much appreciated. \n\nTL; DR: having a baby in 8 weeks &amp; considering sending a no trespassing notice to my nparents (&amp; nbro?) to protect us from them showing up and me having a massive anxiety attack/PTSD episode/meltdown after giving birth. But it would send a very definite message (and I've sent no messages but silence the last 2 years) and may provoke the beast.  Looking for advice. Tia!",

        "text": "Just wondering if anyone had any success going from NC to LC?\nI've been NC for almost a year, but really do feel an empty void. I do miss members of my family that became collateral damage in the NC process. I've spoken with a few of them, gave my side, and they seemed receptive. They claim there's been some growth and realizations on the Ns end, which I do not buy at all, but I do miss the rest of the relatives so much. Is LC a good idea?? I've done up some ground rules:\n\n-no one on one (w/ Nparents and Nsis)\n-no texts/calls\n-will see them at large family gatherings when I can make it, and only at relatives home (they do dinner every Sunday with my relatives at alternating homes)\n-any shred of boundary crossing or N behaviour, I pack up and leave without explanation\n-I don't trust them, so no personal topics will be discussed \n\nI have no idea if my relatives will even go for this. I can't see Ndad agreeing to this. This means no control for the Ns, and no \"back to normal\" for them, but I guess it's worth a shot? \n\nI'm gonna make it clear that I am not looking for a relationship with the Ns. I don't expect that they have changed or will change, i dont miss them at all and have no issue being estranged from them. I just want to see everyone else and if I can make LC work, I will. That being said, if it doesn't. ..well then what have I lost. Aside from missing relatives, I'm at peace without the Ns.\n\n\nHas anyone else had success with implementing some pretty strict rules and having it work out, in the sense that everyone was kept happy enough, so to speak?\n\nI'm looking to try group therapy if anything too -just to have a professional lay down the law and vouch for me, with relatives as witnesses.\n\nThoughts?\n",

        "text": "I have been NC with both my parents, nmom &amp; e/ndad, for about six months now. Of course I've had all the usual back &amp; forths with myself over this choice, guilt, etc, that most survivors deal with. But I feel myself getting stronger by the day. The last time I saw them was almost a year ago when they came to visit me; I live on the east coast and they are in the midwest/great plains. In other words, it's a comfortable physical distance as I've tried to keep throughout my adult life. \n\nI took them here and there to keep them entertained throughout their visit. Nmom insisted this wasn't necessary, but like the immature child she is, if I followed through with that and went about my daily business, she would have complained about being bored. So I made sure to have plans. Anyway, there were two things that happened during that visit that were so toxic and reflective of how hateful she is that keep me feeling good about my decision:\n\n*I give whatever I have on me to houseless people. My paternal grandfather died homeless, on the street, so it's something that I've always felt was important to do besides the obviousness of how rough things are for people, especially now. Out and about with them I did this twice, and both times my mother just groaned and tried to command me not to. For one I'm in my mid-30s and can do whatever the hell I want with my money and resources, and two it just goes to show how little she thinks of people. She prides herself on helping struggling people with her church, but it's always with authoritarian caveats that they have to \"prove\" they are worthwhile to her to receive help. Fuck that.\n\n*For as long as I've known her, she's spit vicious things about people within their earshot if they slightly annoy her then acts sweet as pie the next moment. Of course I have been the target of this numerous times. On the last day of their visit, I really wanted to try this new place I had never been to. And since she said she was up for anything, why not? I acted off the information she gave me -- this is always a helpful thing when defusing Ns I find, but anyway: she soon started to complain because I had a little trouble finding the place. Why such a big deal? I just blew it off and said we'd be there in just a minute. She lags behind with my dad as we walked to the restaurant doing her mean annoyed voice just in my earshot, telling him \"did you hear/see that? She thinks I'm so stupid\" etc etc. She just sounded full of hatred and disgust for me. A voice I'm well accustomed to. And was sure to keep going when I glanced back. \n\nTL;DR -- I know they hate me. They took joy in abusing me and seeing me hurt. But they can't anymore, and they don't even have the ability to lie about how they love me anymore. I must say I take a lot of joy in that and feel more relieved by the day as I fight off the demons they left me with.\n\nCoincidentally, today is their 50th anniversary. I truly have no idea how or why they've stuck together so long. They've spit out hurtful, noxious things about each other to me during that time. Ten years ago I organized a really nice anniversary party for them and it was never met with any gratitude or appreciation that I heard of, which I don't expect necessarily for something I do for other people, but it was another example to me of never being good enough that I don't remember any kind words or recollection of memories from the party. Anyway, I hope they are enjoying the only gift they have ever seemed content with: utter misery.",

        "text": "Hi all,\n\nMy nuclear family (Me, 40, Husband, 39, Girls 10 and 13) has been NC with my N-Alcoholic-Parents for about 18 months now, and I sent a formal NC letter in November of 2014. I worked with a therapist to construct the NC letter - basically, my parents have been drunk on the phone nonstop for a couple of years, and they can't figure out what's going on, so they lash out. My mother is likely a true Narcissist as well, and my dad is selfish and mean but probably more akin to my mother's Golden Child than a true N. This makes a perfect shitstorm of malfunction - they are entitled to the drinking, everyone else is wrong, etc. etc.\n\nA couple of days ago, my daughter turned 13 and my NParents sent a nice gift and they also called. I let it go to voicemail and had my husband screen it. He said it was fine, but my dad's speech was slurred. (The emails I received late on Christmas this past year from NDad were NOT fine. They were nonsense and full of insults.)\n\nPeriodically, my NDad will send me a message accusing me of being immature, having anger manangement problems, or some other nonsense.\n\nI'm wondering if it would make any sense to send another letter thanking them for the nice gift, but reminding them that there is no path back into the family that doesn't involve rehab for them. \n\n\nA bit of background from last year.....\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2m1bd2/finally_worked_up_the_courage_to_go_see_a/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2psbd2/told_my_kids_about_going_nc_with_my_parents_very/\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\nEDIT  - here's what I wrote so far:\n\nThank you for sending DAUGHTER  the jewelry box. It was lovely.\n\nI want to reiterate that the reason we are not accepting phone calls from you is because of your drinking. In the voicemail, Dad’s speech was slurred; I do not think he was sober when he called. \n\nYou are adults and can choose how to live your own lives. If that involves drinking, know that it will not involve us. As I wrote previously, if you opt for recovery, please get in touch with us when you are six months sober. Our next discussion, if there is one, is going to be about what one or both of you have done to address your drinking problem. \n\nThis is a discussion that is completely inappropriate for a holiday or a birthday. I will not risk exposing my children to a drunken tantrum on their birthdays or a holiday. I will not put myself through another one of your drunk tantrums on my birthday or a holiday, and you can probably guess that &lt;Husband&gt; has no patience for this either.  I’m not going to change my mind about this. \n\nBest wishes,\n\nBrightlocks",

        "text": "I'll preface this by saying I'm super cranky at the moment because I'm almost 8 months pregnant, my back and hips hurt like they've never hurt before and my toddler refused to let me take a two hour nap that I desperately needed to function as a person. I got maybe 15-20 min stretches (just really falling asleep) before he'd scream and bang/pound/slam his door before locking himself out. So I'm kinda fragile at the moment and about to head to work. Yay. \n\nSo my baby shower is tomorrow and one of my BFF's is throwing it. I've been so excited all week because it looked like it was gonna be about 20 people coming. All people who want to be there. No obligations. (I'm NC w my family and I didn't even invite my ngrandma bc she's driving me nuts right now). So this is one of the first \"life celebratory\" milestones where it's just people who want to be there bc they love me. So that's huge and super important. \n\nSo the last few days people keep cancelling for various reasons. At first i was fine bc it's life but the more it happens the more squirrelly I get. I'm just so afraid no one will show or maybe just a few people. I don't do these kinds of expectation events well bc of my N's. I think this is common with ACoNs. So I just wanted to vent. I hope tomorrow goes well ",
