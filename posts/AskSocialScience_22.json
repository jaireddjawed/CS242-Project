        "text": "So I just finished reading Jason Brennan's *Against Democracy* and also [this review](http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/against-democracy/) of Brennan's book by Tom Christiano.\n\nBrennan argues that democracies work better than you'd except because policy makers generally aren't responsive to the median uninformed voter, they are instead disproportionately responsive to more informed richer voters who generally favor policies that more closely align with experts. \n\nIn his review, Christiano suggests that democracies function reasonably well due to information economizing shortcuts and a cognitive division of labour. As he puts the question:\n\n&gt;The right question is: how is it possible for democracies to work reasonably well, even for the worst off, when they must make use of an extensive division of cognitive labor that requires that the driving power of the system not be very well informed? Perhaps if we can figure out the answer to this question, we can also figure out how to make democracies work better.\n\nI'm about to start a degree in philosophy and economics and I'm now really looking forward to it because this question seems so fascinating. Would anyone be able to help me get started with some further reading on the subject? Specifically, I'm interested in the following topics:\n\n* How do information economizing shortcuts work?\n* How does a cognitive division of labour work in democracies (or society more generally)?\n* How does public opinion influence or relate to public policy?\n* What are some other attempts at making democracies work better? (Eg. Deliberative Democracy)\n\nI'm currently planning on reading the following:\n\n* An Economic Theory of Democracy - Anthony Downs\n* Rational Deliberation among Citizens and Experts - Tom Christiano\n* Democracy, Public Policy, and Lay Assessments of Scientific Testimony - Elizabeth Anderson\n\nAny advice is appreciated, Thanks!",

We don't see each other very often, but we talk about it when we do. And that was enough for now.\n\nThe thing is she is gonna take the head of a pretty big French think tank network on management (for CEOs), and I think mere occasionnals debates won't be enough to help her keep her head cool.\n\nI thought about giving her (with Xmas coming) the new spirit of capitalism, but I don't think she would read it (too long and a bit too harsh). So I'm looking for stronger vulgarisation on the topic, ideally aimed at people from management backgrounds.\n\nThe book would ideally (but not necessarily) have to be written or translated in French.\nI'm already giving her \"la performance total\" (Florence Jany-Catrice), but it's a bit too economical and not critical enough imo.\n\nThanks in advance :)",

A lot of what I've found says that because the weapons that the military uses are bought from private companies and not distributed to the community at large, that the military is not socialist.\n\nBut it feels like they are answering a different question than the one I'm asking.  When I say \"institution\" I mean \"an established law, practice, or custom.\"  Further, it is my understanding that Socialism is defined as the state owning the means of production (of a good or service) and is charged with distribution of said good or service.\n\nMy thought is that the good or service being produced by the military is that of national defense.  The state controls the production of the service \"national defense.\"  The citizenry then does not directly \"buy\" the service from the government, rather it is distributed fairly equally among the populace.\n\nTo me, it would seem that the military *is* a socialist institution in the same way that roads are: controlled and maintained by the state and not directly purchased by the public.\n\nSo is the military considered a socialist institution?  Is there a difference between that and a public good?\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the great answers everyone! I think I understand where my mistake was coming from.",

Did people in \"ye olden times\" really produce good primarily because they wanted to be a part of a local community? It seems a bit hard for me to buy into the idea of serfs finding their work fulfilling because they are participating in a community endeavor when a large chunk of those efforts were utilized by landed gentry. The intuition here is to see it as a shift in how we view labor, sort of as an extension of romantic visions of the past that were popular in the late 19th century.\n\nSo, was alienation a real social phenomenon, or does it require an unscientific / non-historical understanding of how goods were produced in pre-industrial society? I realize that there may not be much data here, but I figure it's worth a shot since this sort of gets at the roots of the social sciences as a discipline.",

To my knowledge they haven't participated in any wars with their colonizers etc.\n\nOn the other hand you have the UK which is probably the US' most trusted ally and still has political ties under the crown to Canada, Australia and New Zealand.  They are all typically considered \"western\" and  if we take out New Zealand and Australia, are all NATO.  We are all military allies and have fought various wars together.  \n\nI mean I get why African colonies don't have the same relationship racism, Europeans weren't really part of the independence movements, always a very big distinction between colonists and natives etc.  But don't most Latin American countries and Brazil have a significant portion of their population that is at least partly European?  \n\nX posting to /r/AskHistorians ",

        "text": "I'm intensely interested in the intersections of geopolitics, state building, foreign policy and IR, etc. with what defines the groups and populations that states interact with in order to affect policy. Examples are James C. Scott's Seeing Like a State or The Art of Not Being Governed. The latter argues that one can only understand the politics and political dynamics of SE Asia by understanding the geology as well as the social structure of every-day people. Akbar Ahmed's impeccable The Thistle and the Drone makes the strong argument that societies characterized by segmentary lineage social institutions have heavily influenced various state's political objectives and ability to effect policy. Russia had to deal with the Dagars/Avars; the Ottomans the Albanians, Montenegrins; Nigeria continues to struggle with its segmentary societies; and the spread of Islam has an interesting though poorly understood relationship with segmentary societies/pastoralism. Such societies have had strong impacts on the states they interact with - sometimes curtailing those state's ability to effect policy, sometimes supporting them.\n\nThis story is strong historically but continues today: Kurds are an everpresent problem to Turkey, Iraq, and the region, and will continue to do so; Somali state building must deal with the segmentary nature of their society; the current conflict in Yemen similarly reflects segmentary politics; and the War on Terror needs to be fought understanding the social structure and associated psychology. To ignore the segmentary nature of such societies means to completely misunderstand the phenomena of extremism we so thoroughly misunderstood as an \"Islam problem\". Policy effected with such a misunderstanding only produces further radicalization through several mechanisms. \n\nThese two authors argue from an interesting point. Rather than reifying states and presupposing them, they're thoroughly constructivist in both the building of states as well as their politics. These however are mostly anthropologists (I consider Scott more of an anthropologist than a political scientist, though that's arguable). Should I be looking for political scientists doing similar work, who should I read? ",
