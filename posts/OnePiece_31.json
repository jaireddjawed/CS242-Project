        "text": "How did shanks become a yonko,\n\nin order for Blackbeard to become a yonko he had to defeat wang zhi the owner of beehive island and former rocks member.  Luffy had to take out kaido as well and buggy replaced big mom despite not having anything to do with her defeat.\n\nSo how did shanks get it ?  Well I think it was due to the defeat of captain john\n\njohn was a former rocks member\n\nWe can tell by the marines reaction that John was a great pirate in leagues with the yonko.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1tor6p808pla1.jpg?width=745&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b6397d85ec8b42086bdcd2511910779f6e74b459\n\nI feel shiki silvers John and wang zhi were probably yonko tier themselves but for some reason they never became yonko.  shiki was the closest but his defeat to first roger in edd war and second to Garp at marinford cost him.\n\nwang zhi probably was content on beehive island and was in a position where he stayed there and the marines never went after him due to the risk. Until the rocky port incident.\n\nsilvers axe probably went into hiding or something.\n\nbut what happened to John ?\n\nwe saw he was dead in thriller bark and was a killed by his own crew,  now what i find odd is that his body is covered in bandages that existed before his fatal injuries.\n\nNow if he was anywhere near yonko tier I can‚Äôt see his crew killing him.  In comparison. Kaido would wipe the floor with king queen and jack maybe they would cause severe injuries if they teamed up but he would destroy them.\n\nbig mom would flatten katakuri cracker and smoothie.\n\nwhitebeard would kill his commanders\n\nbeckman and zoro are the only ones I see on equal or near equal footing to their emperor boss.  So for John to be killed by his crew feels off, however if he was already injured then maybe.\n\nSo this is what I‚Äôm thinking John was making moves 6 or 8 years ago and came into conflict with the red hair pirates.  Shanks fought John and defeated him leaving him injured and gain enough credibility to become a yonko.  Maybe John was a yonko or maybe back then there was only 3 so then sanko. Anyway John was known for his greed and cruelty so in his weakened state straight after a defeated his crew saw an opportunity and mutinied killing him for good and somehow Moria and hog back got his body to make a zombie.\n\nnow how does kid fit in this.\n\nWell a popular theory is kid is the son of john. Kid is based off of William Kidd who was also a son of a pirate named John.  Kid and john also share the same epithet‚Ä¶‚Ä¶captain.\n\nSo what could kid be John ‚Ä¶..kid ? His grandson ?\n\neither way it seems kid has it out for shanks and buggy.\n\nwhen kid was arguing with luffy about him becoming a yonko while he didn‚Äôt he stopped and claimed that out of all of them the one that really gets under his skin is buggy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/orstg4i18pla1.png?width=1620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=383211ea9cbdd766bad4fca54ddf9c361e0a140d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lm0qk4i18pla1.png?width=1620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=40f36eaca74db2075646c40846c83370a31d867e\n\nNow that is odd. from kid‚Äôs perspective he knows luffy,  they both along with law defeated emperors and yes kid and law was 2 v 1 but luffy wasn‚Äôt fighting alone either he just more or less tagged in and out.\n\nAnyway kid by all means should be focusing his anger to luffy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso why is buggy becoming a yonko the one that has him the most annoyed I mean kid doesn't know buggy power is just for show and he‚Äôs been failing up this entire time,  he should believe the hype.\n\nNow the only thing I can think of that connects kid and buggy is their dislike of shanks.  Buggy hates shanks because he startled him making him eat a df and drop a map into the sea and because shanks kind of just has this irritating personality where he doesn‚Äôt take buggy seriously.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/v0kak9h28pla1.gif\n\nthe only other thing that may connect them is captain John. John may be a father or grandfather to kid and buggy is after John legendary treasure.\n\nCaptain John was first mentioned when buggy was randomly on some island with a skull digging for it\n\nSo if kid is John‚Äôs kid perhaps they both had a run in looking for the treasure got into a fight and buggy being buggy got lucky and escaped leaving kid frustrated and angry at the waste of time.\n\nNow kid crew up on an island in the south blue that was not part of the world government and he crew up in poverty eventually leading his own gang and taking over the island to set up out to sea.  Maybe he was close to John or maybe he hated John who was a cruel father and His dream was to go out to sea and prove himself as a better pirate than John kind of like ace and roger.   Kid actually shares some qualities with ace,  both are originally from the south blue and would have been the same age if ace wasn‚Äôt carried for 20 months or was dead, both are not heads who can‚Äôt take a insult and resort to violence,  both also bring out luffy‚Äôs competitive side.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q361j7s86pla1.jpg?width=474&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=76ce82e05f6af1bb59df67ba46ddde54c5e41a1b\n\n*Processing img fpoa58s86pla1...*\n\nAce grew up in goa kingdom but he crew up in a bandit hideout and spent most of his time in the grey terminal or jungle.   \nSo while ace never really became a gang leader himself he is connect to a gang life like kid.  Ace resented his father roger And left to create a bigger legacy than his eventually he went after whitebeard who was the closest to roger‚Äòs title so if ace beat whitebeard then that would bring him closer to rogers legacy.\n\nsimilar kid could have gone to sea in hopes of gaining enough power to eventually kill John however he received news that shanks defeated him and in his weakened state his crew turned on him killing him.\n\nnow kid wants to fight shanks as a means of proving he is the better pirate than John and perhaps he believes shanks has information on where John treasure is.  He did tell buggy he did but that was a lie‚Ä¶.or was it ?",

The important part would just be Hyogoro asking zoro the name of his village at Rymas grave in order to initiate the flashback. After hearing that he could say how it‚Äôs a pity he doesn‚Äôt know his relatives names, because he feels the blood of shitmosuki in him. In this way zoro would know he‚Äôs likely related but it would just be a chance, and nothing too special, but adding to his character.\n\nWouldn‚Äôt this have been an important plot there to finish?

In Dressrosa, It was said that Kaidou is creating an army of Smile fruit users and the depiction was quite powerful, It really felt like Wano country will really be a great deal but just like other arcs, there were only top fighters and the rest were nothing but fodder. I feel that army stuff really didn't executed well.     Also they were in a YONKO TERRITORY man! and especially **Kaidou - The King of Beasts**, you of course expected something terrifying.",

I heard that this arc was great and one of the best in the series besides the pacing. So far, the pacing hasn't been an issue though even though I was super worried about it and I can't find anything online about where it gets bad. At what episode does it start dragging and going really slow?",

How else can we explain the fact that Brook has managed to keep his afro intact throughout all his adventures, despite facing some of the most dangerous foes in the One Piece world?\n\nAccording to the theory, Brook's afro is actually a sentient being that contains the memories and knowledge of the Void Century. The afro communicates telepathically with Brook, giving him insights and guidance on his quest to uncover the truth about the world's lost history.\n\nFurthermore, the theory suggests that Brook's afro has the power to hypnotize anyone who stares at it for too long, allowing it to extract valuable information from unsuspecting individuals. This is why Brook is often seen wearing sunglasses - to protect others from falling under the afro's spell.\n\nIn conclusion, Brook's afro may seem like just another quirky aspect of his character, but it could hold the key to unlocking one of the biggest mysteries in the One Piece world.",

What if it's not really the ocean floor? \n\nThe sea kings are all very, very different from one another. They don't seem to be the same species nor do the look like each other and we do know they're capable of communication. \n\n[manga 648](https://preview.redd.it/wblvp5i6ylla1.png?width=885&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b175b51d9a69fc53e5925826328beb7fd44a879b)\n\nThey say their ruler is born in the form of a mermais and they're not sure why. I say they're not sure why because they know they're originally humans and were originally ruled on by a human.\n\nThe reason those humans turned themselves into sea creatures (and into fishmen) is to survive a flood caused by the now Celestial Dragons. That's why Poseidon/Shirahoshi is an \"ancient weapon\": the Celestial Dragons fear her power and want to neutralize her. That's why Celestial Dragons heavily discriminate and enslave the fishmen, they're ancient enemies.\n\nThe Celestial Dragons used one of the Ancient Weapons, probably Uranus or some sort of Devil Fruit (ocean ocean fruit? storm storm fruit?), to flood the entire world and some other power to build the Red Line (where Mary Geoise is set on top and Fishman Island directly under, ancient sworn enemies), which is definitely artificial since it's messing with the Whale's migratory route and they're ALL still bashing their heads on it trying to take it down, not just Laboon.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4qgf51oyzlla1.png?width=1193&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4d24504993a7b2eb5ec7065083d88dd9197f80d9\n\nThe sea kings and fishmen are ancient kings and queens turned into sea creatures, now being enslaved and discriminated upon.",

I could definitely see a higher quality official game for One Piece that follow the same style as the Roblox game. \n\nThey should make a game that has you play as your own custom character instead of just playing as the characters from the show and playing through a story. Like a game that takes place in the same universe but maybe at a different time that way they don't have to worry too much about having to incorporate existing characters and story too much and just make a fun game where you grow your crew and travel around becoming stronger.",
