        "text": "###**What does a panelist do?**\n\nThe same thing that you've been doing all along in /r/AskLiteraryStudies: engaging in discussion, responding to people's questions, and helping to cultivate deeper interest in the study and understanding of literature. The only difference is that you will have a tag next to your name depending on your area of expertise, so that people will know that they are dealing with somebody of a certain amount of experience on the matter.\n\n(e.g. my flair indicates that I work primarily on twentieth-century French literature)\n\nFlair does not mean that you are an \"expert\" or an \"authority\" on a certain subject; we're all anonymous here (although I heard that /u/youhatemeandihateyou is actually Harold Bloom). However, it *does* give people an idea of what kinds of questions they can expect to be answered. You can see in the sidebar, for instance, examples of fields that we have panelists in.\n\n###**Who can be a panelist?**\n\nNovelists, poets, graduate students in literary fields, professors in literary fields, M.A./M.Phil./Ph.D.s in literary fields, and high school literature teachers. [Edit: Also, professional editors in literary fields.] *Currently, there is no need for undergraduates to apply,* although there may be something for you to do in the future.\n\n###**How do you know I have those credentials?**\n\nThere's no way of knowing for sure; in fact, it's important that you *remain anonymous*. That encourages diversity of opinion and keeps personality *out* of the mix. However, it will become clear pretty quickly that you don't know what you're talking about, and any panelist, regardless of real or imagined credentials, can be removed.\n\n###**Can I tell people about my theory that Marcel Proust was not an actual person but in fact a committee of IBM punch-card machines?**\n\nNo, you really shouldn't. Your job as a panelist is to *represent your field*, and that includes the most commonly-accepted academic points of view. That said, there's no harm in getting people to think differently about things, so long as you are clear that your view isn't necessarily representative of the field as a whole.\n\n###**OK, so what do I do if I want to become a panelist?**\n\nIt's easy! Just [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskLiteraryStudies) with the following information:\n\n* Field (generally: topics and centuries)\n\n* **Languages (this is important!)** of competency (e.g., English, Spanish, Italian)\n\n* Current position (writer, poet, grad student, professor, etc.)\n\n* Most recent degree (B.A., M.A., Ph.D., etc.) (optional)\n\nFor example (you can even copy and paste):\n\n&gt;*Hi, I work as a graduate student in sixteenth-century Sicilian fish literature. I speak R2-D2. I am interested in becoming a panelist. Thanks!*\n\nThis information is mainly for tagging you with flair including the relevant information. **PLEASE**, do *not* provide any personally-identifiable information (where you are in/went to school, your name, who you worked with, etc.). *This is meant to be anonymous*.\n\nHave fun, and read on!\n\n**Edit: Applications are still welcome!** I'm really happy to see all this new, bright, and colorful flair around. Keep it coming!",

Also, I would not be able to \"pull\" so much out of it, since subtle nuances are lost in translation. \nI'm fluent in English, German and Bulgarian and I'm familiar enough with Latin or Italian to work with them.  \n \nBasically, I would want a poem that is either melancholic in nature, sad, grief-filled, mellow rather than agitating. Preferably it would describe (a person, a concept, a place...) and not tell. It should not be religious, as you may have guessed.  \nIdeally, it would have a \"firm\" structure and a leitmotif, or repeating line, yet it is not crucial.  \n \nThanks to anyone replying in advance, even if I don't find \"the one\" poem, I'm still looking forward to getting to know more poetry.

I wanted her to die. And it had nothing to do with her adultery and everything to do with her histrionics. I think I started disliking her as soon as she started automatically lying. She's by far the most insincere character in the book, although her brother is not far behind.\n\nSpeaking of which, what am I supposed to make of Anna and Oblonski? Were they raised in some way that made them obnoxious? I rather liked Oblonski much of the time. I don't think there's anything wrong with his philosophy of life, but he is a little two-faced.\n\nWhat happened to Karenin and that duchess/countess? That french guy they spent time with seemed like some refined Rasputin. Was that sort of gentlemen common in Tsarist russia?\n\nTolstoy never mentions sex directly. Is this just a product of his time, or did he just do that to be civil?\n\nMorphine and opium seem to be recurring throughout the book. Was that a significant issue in Russia? They seemed to be rather casually addressed in a sideways manner.\n\nI read (on sparknotes) that the end part about the Slav vs Turkish war was Tolstoy condemning the Russian attitude of taking up arms as individuals. I had read it as the opposite to some extent. Not necessarily that he supported that war, but that he supported the right of the individual to choose. Perhaps I shouldn't have thought that though, considering the moral tone of the book is certainly not particularly liberal. Unusual marriage circumstances seem to only cause stress and death.\n\nWhy does everyone seem to be very philosophical in Russian literature?

Not necessarily just the \"And they lived happily ever after\" trope but simply the story ending in such a way that everything is dealt with in a nice tidy package, and an unhappy ending is considered the exception. From what I understand, this is somewhat different from the rest of the world, where tragic or less than ideal endings are the norm, and the so-called happy ending is an exception. \n\nI've always wondered why stories are like this, and why the happy ending seems to be confined to the West, and America in particular.",

The books are: [The Metamorphosis](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/485894.The_Metamorphosis), [The Crucible](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17250.The_Crucible), and [Heart of Darkness] (http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4900.Heart_of_Darkness). My questions (or discussion topics) and my thoughts on it are listed below, and I would really appreciate your help. Thanks!\n\n**The Metamorphosis**\n\n1. Why did Gregor react the way he did when he found out he had transformed into a bug?\nThis puzzled me when I read the book, as he seemed to be unfazed with his transformation. This led me to believe that there were only two possible reasons for this,\nthat he was either refusing to accept reality, or he was indeed more concerned with the well-being of his family rather than his own.\n\n2. What is the importance of the picture of the woman in furs?\nI believe that it symbolizes Gregor's human desires, as the woman may symbolize his sexual desires while her furs symbolize wealth.\n\n**The Crucible**\n\n1. How does Reverend Hale's character change throughout the book?\nHale is introduced to the book as a individual who believes strongly in witch-craft, but begins to doubt the existence of such a thing when he discovers that Abigail\ntricked him.\n\n2. How did the sudden amount of power given to Abigail and the girls affect their character?\nAbigail's sudden emergence as a figure of authority, combined with her inexperience, led her to do some things that had consequences that she could not foresee. The\nbiggest example would be the destruction of the entire town of Salem.\n\n**Heart of Darkness (I don't really understand the book so I don't have any answers for these topics)**\n\n1. How does Marlow's character change throughout the story? What effect does this have on the outcome of the story?\n\n2. What is the meaning of Kurtz's last words: \"The horror, the horror!\"?\n\n3. What does the word darkness in the title of the book symbolize in the story?\n\nOnce, again I would really appreciate your help and thanks in advance!",

        "text": "While I don't want to diminish the diverse range of influences on genre writers and their own unique styles of prose, it's been my experience that the large majority of genre fiction tends to use a fairly straightforward style of prose writing, wherein figurative language of all kinds is kept to a minimum, and syntax/diction/etc. is intended to be as un-intrusive as possible.\n\nI feel like the lack of figurative language can be attributed largely to Realism, but have had problems finding an analogue for the stripped-down nature of the sentence structure and wording, as most of the Realist authors I am familiar with are often elaborate in these areas. The style of the Gothic novel may be the closest I can think of; The Monk by Matthew Gregory Lewis in particular seems predictive of the shape and style of genre work to come.\n\nBut these are all idle speculations on my part; has anyone here studied these patterns of influence explicitly?\n\nP.S. I would like to bracket any arguments over what constitutes genre fiction vs. literary fiction. It may well be that my premises regarding the prevailing style of 'genre' works is far too reductive and/or entirely false, but hopefully we can still use it as a constructive jumping-off point of inquiry about, at least, the genre fiction authors I am intending to indicate e.g. GRR Martin, if not genre authors as a whole. To be sure, I am not trying to insult genre writers by labeling them as such and thereby implying that books filed away as \"literature\" at Barnes and Noble are sacrosanct.

Unfortunately, my undergrad couldn't be any more different, mathematics. I work full time, as well as write prose and poetry Sunday-Friday, but I'm still determined to work as hard as I can.\n\nWhile I read modern literature, I'm more interested in older literature, although most of my exposure is in Ancient Greek stories, but I've dabbled in other mythologies, and have recently been ensnared by Fitzgerald and Shakespeare. I read as much as I can, poetry and prose, and try to spend time analyzing them and reading deeper than I'm used to. So here begins my questions:\n\n1) What are some great places to start off in reading? Right now I'm reading a book on Ancient Greek history, as I know little to nothing on history, and have heard countless times that it's necessary to understand deeper points in stories. What are some more literature books that you fine ladies and gentlemen would suggest?\n\n2) I know in the US, schools require 1-2 foreign languages during your first 1-2 years. I'm learning Ancient Greek. Would this count, given that it's a dead language, at most universities? I plan on learning Italian eventually, but I really want to get better at Ancient Greek.\n\n3) What are some other ways to prepare or increase my chances in being accepted? Am I doomed to be that person never taken seriously as an applicant, or is there some glimmering hope hiding among my quantitative background?\n\nThanks for anyone who has the patience to read this and help a fellow out!

Can a narrator be OVERT and still use a focaliser? If so, please do explain, as to me it seems impossible.\n\n2. How can a heterodiegetic, overt narrator have outside AND inside view? He doesn't use reflectors (usually) and could theoretically not be able to see the inside of the characters. Or is this in connection with him being \"olympian\" and \"omnipresent\"? And even if so, wouldn't this mean that everytime he describes the feelings of a character this character becomes his reflector?

It's not so much that I enjoy reading through dreadfully written texts in a foreign language, but I like the way these writers have made me think. I really have the idea that I can apply and criticize some of the material and even add theories of my own.\n\nBut, and here is the problem: I didn't get any good grades (neither did many of my classmates). Granted, this is one of the hardest programs in my country, but I really want to get a very good grasp on this material.

Y'all probably have fancy study books from back in the day, that is likely what I'm looking for.

The new arrival must rapidly identify the books and give their significance, proving that he is a not a coal company infiltrator. Though I am unable to find the scene online, there is a homage in the film [*Hackers*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers_film) ([link to scene](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=cCATVu88xAY#t=188s)).\n\nThough the use of a book -- an *object* -- rather than a \"word, sound, or custom\" prevents a perfect comparison to the [biblical story](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibboleth#Origin), I think it still fits rather well as a shibboleth of cultural knowledge. Though all shibboleths are, by definition, cultural, in this context the 'correct' answer is a demonstration of knowledge, not behavior (e.g. pronunciation). \n\nI think the term has particular importance in the context of internet culture, and perhaps how we come to define [truth](http://www.dreamyoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Polished-Turd.jpg) after [postmodernism](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mrUx7B-3PPY/TOQjuNYbhqI/AAAAAAAAAow/SGACg6zYBgQ/s1600/NutellaSpoon.jpg). My ideas are still in their infancy, but I would eventually like talk about the replacement of logical rigor with the shibboleth -- a kind of (pataphysical?) substitution, whereby the demonstration of cultural identity becomes more important in constituting truth than the logical rigor of the truth presented.\n\nSo, that said, does anyone have any insight into this term? Would any biblical scholars like to give their take on it? Have any of the post-structuralists written on it? It really is fascinating, so any suggestions are welcome. Please post comments and questions if any ideas pop into your head; I feel like we need more discussions on this board.\n\nEdit: I'm also wondering if I should cross-list this post to some other subreddits which might have different knowledges to draw from. Suggestions welcome.\n\nEdit2: [/r/academicBiblical x-post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicBiblical/comments/1fso58/xpost_askliterarystudies_shibboleth/)",

        "text": "So, this summer, I am going to be putting together something of a \"senior thesis,\" or whatever you want to call it. I already have about 3000 words of pure textual analysis together comparing *Native Son* by Richard Wright and *Invisible Man* by Ralph Ellison. The main hinge of my comparison is responsibility because in *IM*, the narrator states that \"[r]esponsibility rests upon recognition\" (14). So, my current essay looks at how responsibility is built through language(s) of recognition, ultimately arguing that the narrator of *Invisible Man* has the tools to enact some kind of responsibility potentially because he forms his own language of recognition, while Bigger cannot be be responsible because, in *Native Son*, there is a lack of sufficient language through Bigger can recognize things. (let me know if you need the nuances of the argument to help me further. I tried to boil it down as much as I can for this purpose).\n\nSo, I want to expand the discussion of responsibility outside of these texts. Where do I start? Quick research has led me to Aristotle, as he is commonly attributed with talking about \"moral responsibility\" first, but I don't know of what import that would be to these texts. \n\nWashington talks about it a bit in *Up From Slavery*, but I fear that there may not be enough \"philosophical\" (I use that term for lack of a better one) content in his use of the term to justify using him as a theoretical basis. I have not read a whole lot of Du Bois, but I think he talks about responsibility somewhere, if I remember right. Both *IM* and *NS* mention both of these men in some way or another, so that's the only way.\n\nIs there any way I could ground the discussion of responsibility in an historical context? If so, where should I start?\n\nIn short, I need a starting point for starting to develop a discussion of responsibility outside of these texts and a good reasoning for why I'm choosing said benchmarks. I'm slightly confused and frustrated with myself right now, but I can see some gain from the route I'm imagining right now, so I'd just like to get your guys' thoughts on a starting point and its worth in regards to the two novels.\n\nEdit: I don't know if I titled this post properly. Please forgive any ambiguity.\n\nAnother edit: I found this link to be of a bit of interest, though this is not a work of philosophy I am undertaking here. http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-responsibility/\n\nEdit 3: removal of unnecessary words.",

        "text": "Hi\n\nNot to boast, but I think my English is very good. I've no problem to express myself adequately and no problem understanding complicated texts. However when it comes to poetry I'm completely lost, and I really want to know how to read it.\n\nThere are two parts to the issue, first is that I don't know for certain how the rhythms work. With some easy poetry I can get into the rhythm (for example the playful poem Jabberwocky from Through the looking-glass and what Alice found there), but for more difficult poetry I will understand the rhythm for some of the lines but read it as an ordinary text for others.\n\nThe other problem is the vocabulary. I said I can understand complicated texts, but from these texts you can often deduce the exact meaning of a sentence even if you only know the approximate meaning of a word. I gather the same can not be said for poetry.\n\nFor example, I've tried reading the poem [Benediction](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/36098/36098-h/36098-h.htm#Benediction) from an English translation of Charles Baudelaire's poem collection 'The Flowers of Evil' (link is for the entire collection, but should take you straight to the part with Benediction). I realize not all poems have a 'story', but I understand it that this one does and I think I get most of it (the poet's charm is driving everyone else into decadence, is my interpretation, or possibly that he's driving them all down with him... probably the latter.). But there are large parts which I don't quite understand. I tried looking up some of the (quite few) words I didn't already understand. Still lines like 'The consecrated penance of maternal crimes.' leave me clueless; how do I go about to fix this? There're also some (only one in this poem) terms which I've tried looking up but haven't found an answer for, in this case 'love-leaf'.\n\nBest regards",

I also thought that Structuralism can be used by looking at linguistics and Jonathan Culler's \"The linguistic Foundation\", by exploring the language used in food advertisements, and the \"buzz words\" (signifiers) which have no real meaning with regard to the food but instill some impression into the consumer's head which is likely false (signified). Also Roland Barthes' \"Mythologies\" could be useful for examining food advertisements. I also wanted to look into ecocriticism, because I thought it might offer some insight, but surprisingly I'm having difficulty finding any scholarship pertaining directly to our food systems.

I was wondering if anyone has any thoughts on it and/or can shed some light. Mainly I'm confused about who is speaking during the poem but most importantly at the end. I want to know if I'm right in thinking that the elder sister was engaged maybe to Estwick Hall and in the end the younger sister is \"wed\" to his soul. It says \"the young girl hushed on her lips a groan\", does that mean the younger sister? Google offers no interpretations and I'm just curious. It's no big deal. Also if this is somehow the wrong subreddit, could you redirect me, please? Thanks.",

        "text": "I require some help interpreting this poem by Plath. I have the general gist of it, but my contextual information as to when it was written isn't sufficient for understanding the last two stanzas.\n\nApprehensions is a poem written by Plath in the May of 1962, around the time she began to suspect her husband Hughes of having an affair. **(see poem below)**\n\nThere are 4 walls portrayed in each the poem, identified by their respective colours – white, grey, red and black – which correspond to individual stanzas. The narrator, who I assume to be Plath, alternates or transitions between describing different walls. The motif of the wall represents one of her emotional perspectives/states and contains a wide range of related ideas. Collectively these walls form a room – an enclosing space for thoughts which illustrates her mind.\n\nThe title of the poem is demonstrative of Plath's many fears and anxieties that plagued her throughout the course of her lifetime – her strained relationships with prominent males in her life, her father and her husband – and more specifically her depression. It also sets the overriding tone for the essay which is that of pessimism.\n\nThe first wall describes Plath's physical and mental restriction using the symbolism of the unreachable; **the beauty and wonder of what is beyond her illness is diluted by the white wall**. White is usually a colour found in medical institutions, and due to her long history with clinical depression, I think the white wall is illustrative of a barrier (both mental and social). The idea of the sky creating itself above the wall is an analogy of the faint glimmers of hope she had that everything would become good again (possibly in relation to her suspicions of her husband). The second line is mostly just description of the sky - the possibilities - this could probably refer to her longing for it. Angels and stars - majestic things that are beyond her. The sun dissolving, [bleeding its lights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=RtLbUYmV12g#t=11s) is part of the daily cycle - could this be related to her ongoing battle with depression, as she faces it each day? My final point about this stanza is that **as per the symbolism of the walls composing her mind, she can see into her mind (what is enclosed by the white wall), but no further**.\n\nStanza two is all about despair (grey wall) - **how Plath is unable to escape from her mental torture**. The wall being clawed and bloody reminds me of someone trying to escape from a prison cell, scratching at the wall until they start to bleed, because they want to escape so badly. Line two and three are interrelated. Her inability to escape mental anguish is illustrated by her apparent escape from the mind (stairs at her back - in reference to the top of the back being connected to the skull, where the brain is located) descending into a well - somewhere she cannot escape frhom. Finally I don't have any indepth analysis of the last two lines of this stanza - I assume they are just cumulative emphasis for her distaste for her situation.\n\nThird stanza tells a story of **her physical and emotional vulnerability**, and her **growing tension** surrounding it. Her tension is illustrated firstly by the wincing. The red fist opening and closing is visual imagery for her heart. Based on this assumption, the two grey papery bags are her lungs. A rapidly beating heart is indicative of terror, and the papery nature of her lungs portrays her physical vulnerability. **I need some help understanding the last two lines of this stanza, as I think context is very important here**.\n\nFinally, the black wall shows her mental anguish and instability. The unidentifable birds symbolise how nothing is clear for her, and show her detachment from reality? The last three lines are definitely related to context:\n\n  * there is no talk of immorality among the birds - morality in relation to hughes?\n  * cold blanks approach us - who do the cold blanks approach? what are cold blanks? I'm thinking they could be blackouts.\n  * they move in a hurry - I think the birds are moving in a hurry here. Once I understand the above lines this one will probably make sense. \n\nSo yes, that is my complete understanding of the poem at this point. If anyone could help out in any way it would be absolutely fantastic. \n\nPoem:\n\n    There is this white wall, above which the sky creates itself--- \n    Infinite, green, utterly untouchable. \n    Angels swim in it, and the stars, in indifference also. \n    They are my medium. \n    The sun dissolves on this wall, bleeding its lights. \n\n    A grey wall now, clawed and bloody. \n    Is there no way out of the mind? \n    Steps at my back spiral into a well. \n    There are no trees or birds in this world, \n    There is only sourness. \n\n    This red wall winces continually: \n    A red fist, opening and closing, \n    Two grey, papery bags--- \n    This is what I am made of, this, and a terror \n    Of being wheeled off under crosses and a rain of pieties. \n\n    On a black wall, unidentifiable birds \n    Swivel their heads and cry. \n    There is no talk of immorality among these! \n    Cold blanks approach us: \n    They move in a hurry.",
