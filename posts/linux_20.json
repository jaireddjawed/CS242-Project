        "text": "Hello everyone, \n\nI have a new PC (around a month):\n\n* CPU: AMD Ryzen 7700X\n* MB: Gigabite B650M DS3H\n* RAM: Kingston Fury Beast Black 32GB (2x16GB) DDR5 6000 CL36\n* PSU: Asus TUF Gaming 750W Bronze\n* no dedicated GPU\n* it is custom build, but I had it build professionally from the vendor, didn't built myself\n\nand it suddenly crashed two times int the last month, both times in the same way:\n\n* no risky applications running (only Brave, Neovim, Okular)\n* no high temperatures, pretty low usage of resources\n* no specific action triggered it, it happened out of nowhere\n* what happened: monitor went black, keyboard and mouse lost power, but fans kept going and red LED with label \"CPU\" turned on (stable light, no blinking)\n* computer didn't react to any input, not even power button (tried both short and long press)\n* had to plug out power and then it turn it back on - booted normally immediately after, nothing seemed broken\n\nOf course I have tried to search for logs, but didn't find anything useful (logs were either empty, non-existent or not relevant). I use Manjaro XFCE with stable kernel, but instead of XFCE I run AwesomeWM. \n\nNow the question I have: Do you have any idea what could be the problem? Or how to find out? I am not experienced in this kind of troubleshooting and online resources suggested that I should read logs or that my computer is fried (which it obviously isn't).\n\nThank you, have a nice day.",

So what would the consequences be, if Linus Thorvalds suddenly got hit by a bus and died, or suffered a stroke and became completely incapacitated for a year or more?",

        "text": "It’s a simple question that almost every answer I see is “fuck Microsoft” or “I just like the freedom” without explaining what that freedom is.\n\nI know you probably get the same question everyday from people claiming that windows is just better and simpler and so on but I’m asking this question before switching to linux to give it a try.\n\nLooking from the outside tho, Linux seems like an OS with extra steps to certain things like gaming or updating the drive. Why would a user look at linux and decide to switch? I’d love to hear your take on it and on why you may have switched to Linux even if you knew it’ll come with limitations to you.",

        "text": "I have been using Linux in and out for over 10 years. Spent times when I used it exclusively and other times where dual booted for different reasons.\n\nUsed Ubuntu and it's derivatives (mint, elementary, pop, maybe others), Fedora, Arch, openSUSE and tried all kinds of DEs, Gnome, KDE, riced i3wm from scratch on Arch and overall had fun moments with it, never actually used Linux in a professional scenario as my employers always provided Windows computers which were irrelevant anyways since I always logged remotely into IBM mainframe machines running z/OS or AS400.\n\nSo I am coming from from a everyday user perspective, I am now at the moment to simply admit that Linux is an amazing experience on the tty screen, the thing just works, the best state I ever had a Linux machine i when I am installing Arch and login into the installed system for the first time before installing any desktop environment.\n\nNow every time I try to use either kde or gnome, or xfce or whatever it is, it's just pain. It wasn't at some point, maybe I was less picky, or maybe it was because I was poor when I was studying and stuff used to just work since I didn't had a graphics card. It's quite a known fact that gpu support on Linux is a complete mess. But it's not just that.\n\nLet's review the current state of things.\n\nXorg and Wayland: First and foremost, Xorg is horrible in every sense of the word and until wayland is ready we are stuck with this thing. The compositors that work with it suck, even if you enable vsync things aren't as smooth as Wayland and whatever windows and the mac use. I sometimes wonder if many hardcore Linux users just use linux on xorg and that's why they don't notice how jagged everything is in comparison, it's the only logical explanation to not see that there's a clear issue, is like you go back in time when seeing how stuff drawing on the screen behave when using Xorg, then there's no consistency, some apps will run smoothly for instance Firefox, and then you install Chrome and both scrolling and resizing the window stutters, which makes you constantly need to troubleshoot on a app basis, which is horrible for productivity. Sure Wayland is smooth and it obviously feels more modern, until stuff starts to break and you realize you are a alpha tester of a product with almost 15 years of development... that will one day... eventually... somewhere in the future... work properly.\n\nGraphics drivers situation: Nvidia support plain and simply sucks, first of all it only works \"properly\" on Xorg and as previously stated, Xorg sucks. So in the end of the day it just sucks. I don't even have a Nvidia anymore but I had one for a very long time and once blamed Nvidia for my graphical issues on Linux, I used to think to myself \"i should have got and AMD\" because literally everyone said it was a bliss, \"things just work bro\"... then i got an AMD (RX 6700 XT), it's true that it works much better out of the box, you literally just install any distro and the kernel drivers are there and you don't even need to think about it... again, until you do. Then you decide to do 3D editing on literally the most well known open source artists software around, Blender and you realize HIP is not supported with the open source drivers and therefore your GPU is not recognized and you can't render with it... so much for \"it just works bro\", I often wonder what you all do with your computers for saying stuff like that but alas... Then you, as a sensible person follow the instructions and install the proprietary drivers which supposedly make HIP work... knowing fully well that these drivers pretty much suck on everything else besides professional software like Blender, which in itself is suck a dumb state of affairs. Still, as I don't plan to play games it's fine. Then to your surprise upon booting with the new drivers the computer crashes... Then you wonder \"hmmm... i literally just install the official drivers from AMD as requested per one of the most popular applications around on the most popular Linux distro (Ubuntu) which was just installed and is in a pristine state and just like that you blow up your installation.\" And I ask you now, is this a user ready experience? Be truthful with yourself in these things, sure you love open source and so on, but put that aside, be objective and think about this... Then after a while troubleshooting I realized it's probably Wayland, the amd drivers aren't compatible with a wayland session most likely, I didn't even tried Xorg because I refuse to use it, it's just too bad (have I said already that I hate Xorg?). Anyway so at this point you realize you have to at least dual boot Windows if you want to do any 3D artist work, which pretty much boots out an entire work sector from the OS out the window.\n\nAnd I could go on ranting about how everything related to displaying and graphics stuff sucks on the platform but this will probably be enough to upset people so I will leave it at this.\n\nAfter years of great fights, and long hours of troubleshooting and hitting walls because \"X is not compatible with X\" buying new hardware and then now it's great on one thing but then you find out there are also tradeoffs and it's always this continuous mess, I came up to the verdict that it just sucks. I will probably only use Linux from now on to setup servers and similar stuff. It's unusable if you are a very broad user who dabbles in all kind of stuff as a hobbies.\n\nWhen I can install a linux distro on Wayland and just use my computer without bothering if application  X works I might give it a spin again. But in it's current form... it's not looking good bruv, it's not looking good.",
