I saw that the cheeky gits at Deliveroo have upped their service charge to 10% now!  That's on top of the \u00a33.99 delivery fee too!\n\nJust-Eat, by comparison, offer free delivery on Five Guys and their service fee is 5%.  So that \u00a310 code only saved me a fiver than if I just ordered on Just-Eat instead.\n\nA few years ago both Just-Eat and Deliveroo had a fixed 50p service charge, then the tossers at Deliveroo changed it to 5% and then Just-Eat did the same less than a month later.  Just-Eat are probably getting ready to roll out a 10% service charge now too, if they think they can get away with just matching Deliveroo on the assumption that customers will be choice-less in the matter.\n\nFor the last year or so my local Wimpy have been hiding an extra \"Bag fee\" charge on Just-Eat.  Feels like they're cheating the system by showing a \u00a32.49 delivery fee, but when you check out they add an extra \u00a31 bag fee - when they should just show a delivery fee of \u00a33.49.  I'm sure they're just abusing that facility.  I'm pretty sure the bag fee facility is for people ordering groceries from a local shop or supermarket and it's meant to be for the plastic bag charge ('tax').

It used to be a great pub, went there regularly after work with my mates. Knew all the staff and the manager, they knew what we drank and often had it out and ready before we got through the doors. Then the manager got moved (and fucked over by the company), the new manager was shit and the staff scattered to other places. \n\nAfter work I headed in thinking I had could have a couple of ciders and a meal while I read a book before having to catch the last bus home. Get in don't recognise the staff but think nothing of it as the last time they'd been training someone new as well. Order my food and drink, then sit there reading while sipping the pint. I finish the first pint and am halfway through the second when I become concerned about where the fuck is my food I've got a bus to catch. Food comes out as I'm about to head to the bar and demand my money back as I have to leave so I shrug and set to eating. The beans are cold, the sausage is both burnt and undercooked at the same time, and the bacon is almost non-existent. Fucking rank food so I left half of it on the plate, plus now I don't have time to demand a refund, and to top it off I've got to cook a dinner when I get home and am feeling sick from the crap I just tried to eat in the pub.","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1678483125.0},{"author":"DrachenDad","text":">one sad Aunt Bessie yorkie, dry meat, two potatoes if you're lucky, a fucking cube of stuffing\n\nI think you've answered your own question.","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1678490860.0},{"author":"Take_away_my_drama","text":"I don't know why it's so hard to do a fucking roast potato right, but I've had enough bad ones from pubs to know I'm never paying for them again.","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1678495855.0},{"author":"TheHoneyThief","text":"If I wanted to support my local pub (prior to moving out) then I would have done the following:\n\n1) Visited on a Monday night and spent all evening talking about how awful brown people are with a guy called Rudders.\n\n2) Gone for a cheeky ale or ten on a Tuesday night and made detestable remarks to women as they left.\n\n3) Nipped in for a quick five pints on a Wednesday and cheated on my then girlfriend with someone I went to school with and her irritating as fuck friend who had a driving ban.\n\n4) Reluctantly decided to stroll in of a Thursday, purchase some cocaine from the chavs at the bar and snorted it off the same toilet seat some of my customers at work had used.\n\n5) Rolled around on a Friday, bought seven pints off the barman and a knife from the chef.

Sometimes there is a medical emergency which we try and keep calm and not panic waiting patients whilst we are helping someone who has fainted, had an asthma attack or something worse an we are waiting for an ambulance.\n\nThen you have the last patient of the morning\/ evening who calls the practice when they are nearly 10 mins late for their 50 min treatment saying they will be 5 mins because they are stuck in traffic, get in 15 mins later and use the loo before entering the surgery and asking multiple questions on what they are having done again which you discussed before or complaining about a random niggle you have. Had a lady do this yesterday and then refuse to have an important impression done insisting she thought it was a bite block and didn't want to use it, despite telling her it was an impression needed for a temporary crown. Needless to say we started 25 mins late and wasted an alginate impression before we started and ran over 15 mins into lunch which delayed the girls in the decontamination room their lunch by at least 10 mins as they needed to get the instruments though.\n\nSo yes, dentists suck by arriving on the dot or minutes after the patient is due whilst the nurse before got there early and set up and often does not get paid until the first patient starts (on a shitty low wage for what it's for btw). But then they will spend extra time helping you if they can do a job in 5-10 mins without running too late or needing you to come back in for a 15-25 min appointment another day.\n\nIt's crunch time for dentists from new years to April to meet their targets for the NHS so from March they are likely to squeeze as many extra treatments in as they can.

Wanting to get round him before I was on his tail, I made moves to start pulling out. I decided against such an action as there was a car in the nearside lane attempting to stop me by matching my speed (65\/70), actively slowing and speeding up to block me. That isn't what confused me, people can be dicks, what got me was that it looked like it was indicating in... with a solid orange light in the wing mirror. Now, there's some odd indicators and headlight styles going about, so I didn't think much of it. Said car made no movement to indicate they were pulling in, carrying on as 'normal', again nothing to write home about. The light didn't flash, and I couldn't make out if it was just a shit indicator or some reflection, so went on my way and forgot about it.\n\nJust seen another one in the light today... they have orange lights actually in the mirrors?!

Like I've gone to school in the snow before, the teachers for my scheduled lessons couldn't make it in, I spent an hour I the IT suite with kids from like 3 different year groups who also didn't have their teachers then it started to snow again so they sent us troopers who'd made it in home anyway.\n\n2nd of all the health and safety aspect is the main reason they shut and it's not just them being overcautious with modern health and safety gone mad.\n\nIn the mid 2000s something happened to the roof of the comprehensive school that was built 10 meters from my primary. Both schools kept students inside during lunch and break, we only went outside to get in at the start of the day and leave at the end of the day. This was to reduce to chance of us getting injured if a stray bit of roof fell down (there was a storm with strong winds and the damage was on the closest bit of roof to the primary so I guess they worried it could blow over and hit us). But we stayed open. \n\nThe same 2 schools would close 90% of the time it snowed, including sending us home midday if the bus companies decided they wouldn't make it later in the day.\n\nThe risk of us getting hit by a roof while we spent 30 seconds dashing off the premises in the opposite fire to to said roof was much lower than 1) the risk of us getting hit by the roof whilst spending 30 minutes outside and 2) the risk of god knows what happening if you left us inadequately supervised. \n\nI think people don't factor in why the teacher:pupil ratios exist. At home your kids are significantly easier to manage because you don't have 30 of them. No doubt, they've still managed to do dumb stuff AND have arguments escalate in a micro second even though there's probably like at least a 1:2 or 1:3 adult to child ratio in most houses. \n\nI mean I managed to climb out of a window in primary whilst my teacher was IN the room at an adequate teacher:pupil ratio (I fell climbing back in and at that point got reprimanded for being out of my seat so she didn't miss EVERYTHING just...most of it). There was a kid in class at primary who was very easy to rile up and over lunch time many people got strangled after pushing him too far. It's not just that kids might hurt themselves by being stupid and doing something dumb if they're inadequately supervised, but if 1 kid is having a bad day and snaps things can escalate and they'll hurt each other. \n\nAn office being understaffed only really runs the risk of someone loosing their temper. But hopefully unlike primary school children most office workers can self regulate enough to not physically lash out every single time and can also control their impulsive thoughts enough to not escape the building via a window.","upvotes":4,"created_utc":1678401870.0},{"author":"Happytallperson","text":"Most posters here were born after that hurricane. \n\n*watches as OP crumbles to dust*","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1678372463.0},{"author":"Alternative_Rush4451","text":"Where I live, a couple of cm of snow yesterday morning, I'm in the town, but outlying rural areas especially in valleys are now snowed in for a couple of days.","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1678377063.0},{"author":"_maharani","text":"That\u2019s a really poor safeguarding choice.

I don't really think there was anything like enough snow to remotely justify it.\n\nBut.... It is always useful to understand the thinking behind it. \n\nSo, let's consider this scenario. \n\nIt's snowing, but it's sludgy and icey. Do I let the kids play outside at lunchtime?\n\nIf I don't, I'll get parents complaining that we didn't let them go outside.\n\nIf I do and one slips over and goes to first aid (highly likely) or gets a black eye from being hit by an ice ball (moderately likely), I'll get parents (likely the same parents) complaining that it was ridiculous that I put their child at risk by allowing them to go out. \n\nIn that latter scenario, there are four potential outcomes; \n\n1) a complaint email that is never followed up (by the patent, as in they drop it); \n\n2) a formal complaint that leads to an investigation of me by one of the senior leaders, possibly a reprimand;\n\n3) Parent goes to the local rag and a story is done about our irresponsible school, alongside compo-face picture;\n\n4) parent complains to Ofsted. That triggers a qualifying complaint and potentially a one day safeguarding inspection at no notice, when we aren't ready with all the data to hand they'll want, and if they find (or decide they intend to find) one i not dotted they put us in special measures and the head gets the sack. \n\nOr I can save the hassle of all of that by just not letting them go outside.\n\nExactly the same scenario with sending home; litigious parents, or malicious parents who know they can threaten us with Ofsted or the local rag (where school has no real right of reply other than generic statements) who will complain either way but it's easier to take the super safe scenario that doesn't involve a potential safeguarding complaint. Everything is safeguarding now.\n\nAlternatively, at a rural school you'll have the bus companies that bus kids there ringing you late morning saying that they are sending the buses now or they won't be sending them at all, because by the afternoon the roads might be too bad.

When we gave notice they consistently gave us less than 24 hours notice before before showing new tenants around. They were doing the viewings themselves, no estate agent involved. They were sending their dodgy, useless handyman to show the tenants the property. On one of the days we were told there would be one viewing in the morning. About 2 hours  after the viewing we were eating lunch and the front  door opened to the handyman letting himself and other prospective tenants into the flat. He was very put out when I demanded they leave immediately without looking around. We complained to the landlord and they just laughed it off and gave a half arsed apology. Then the icing on the cake was they tried to take \u00a3150 off the deposit for \"cleaning\" after we moved out. It was a state when we moved in, there was no inventory, and we left it spotless.

Average man is 5\"10, so above that is tall for example. But I couldn't do any maths with it, or use them on literally anything else. \n\nI try to just use metric now because it's far easier and most people understand without any explanation.","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1678348326.0},{"author":"Liggliluff","text":"I know I'm nitpicky, but if you'er going to use metric, it's a really good idea to use standard symbols. These aren't abbreviations that can be made however you want. Just as \"20\" means the value of twenty and you can't write this as \"twty\" or \"2ten\" or any other made up way, you should likewise be as strict with metric.\n\nFor example, gram will always have the symbol \"g\" regardless of what context it's used in. The prefix kilo- will always have the symbol \"k\" regardless of what context it's used in. You can't leave out symbols for units or prefixes. So kilogram is only written as \"kg\", and not \"KG\", \"kgs\" or \"KGS\". This ensures clear communication.\n\nAnother example is, just because in the Imperial system, you write \"mph\", that doesn't mean you can write \"kph\" in metric. That is wrong. You're breaking the rules. The symbol for metre is always \"m\" and you can't leave it out. If you have one unit per another, you write \"\/\", and hour always has the symbol \"h\". So you write \"km\/h\". In the Roman system, you write eight as \"VIII\", but that doesn't mean you can write it as \"5111\" with Arabic numerals. The same way you can't write \"kph\".\n\nAnother common British way is writing \"gsm\", which if we follow metric rules, this means \"gram-second-metre\", a mass-time-length unit. But it is intended to mean \"grams per metre squared\", which is written as \"g\/m\u00b2\". This last one is proper metric, and will be understood by everyone who uses metric. \"g\" is gram, \"m\u00b2\" is metre squared, and \"\/\" is one by the other unit.","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1678400977.0},{"author":"MrStu56","text":"I don't even know why they tell you the weight of a baby, let alone do it in lbs.

They are recorded by a system called TRUST that captures the headcode as the train passes a defined timing point. \n\nStations are usually always timing points, but they can also be junctions, key railway features and sometimes just signals (where there are long stretches between junctions, usually because historically there was a signal box\/block post there). \n\nIf your train passed the last timing point on time but has been held up somehow between there and your location then it will continue to show as \u201con time\u201d until a point where the software rendering that information for public consumption regards the information as unreliable and that\u2019s when you get the \u201cDelayed\u201d message without any notion of time.\n\nAlso, if a train was on time but has since been routed away from its next scheduled timing point, and has incurred delays as a result, these will not be recorded by TRUST until it returns to its scheduled route (this can happen where deviation routes are available, such as going down a main line rather than branch that loops away and comes back, like at Wishaw in Lanarkshire). \n\nSome platform display systems will sometimes display certain timing point information now, such as \u201cTrain departed X station on time at xx:xx\u201d. That doesn\u2019t mean that it can\u2019t be delayed after that point. \n\nIt is possible for the Signaller or Train Running Controller to update TRUST with more accurate delay information if they know it, but they normally won\u2019t for short delays like this. \n\nRealtimetrains pulls all it\u2019s information from TRUST so won\u2019t tell you if your train is still on the move. Though you can see where it was last recorded. Traksy shows live signalling feeds (for most areas, not all) so you can see if your train has been held at a red signal or is maybe waiting on another train passing across its route. \n\nBe aware though that in areas with older mechanical signalling and some radio based systems, the information is not gathered automatically and requires to be input by the signaller to TRUST, so expect data errors  and input delays in those areas.\n\nSo it\u2019s nothing to do with any notion of how we record anything under 10 minutes as \u201con time\u201d, it\u2019s just a technical limitation of the signalling system.","upvotes":19,"created_utc":1678129382.0},{"author":"DarlingIAmTheFilth","text":"I think I read something ages ago that said a train isn't officially late until it's 10+ minutes behind schedule.","upvotes":18,"created_utc":1678095536.0},{"author":"retyfraser","text":"They never said 9.01 today. !!!","upvotes":11,"created_utc":1678097036.0},{"author":"ObstructiveAgreement","text":"Use realtimetrains and see where it is along the journey.

Car purchases can also be pretty pricey (even if used). The insurance on said car is also way more expensive. \n\nThen let\u2019s talk taxes: income tax is probably a bit lower in the UK, but how about property tax? I left the UK about 5 years ago. From what I recall, council tax was less than \u00a32k on my house. Property tax here: -$10k, and that\u2019s in a relatively cheap part of the country (albeit in a big city).

The bill (once taxes and tips were taken into account) was $180. It wasn\u2019t a fancy Michelin starred restaurant. Just a pretty normal kind of location. \n\nLoads of miscellaneous costs can add up too: yard maintenance is commonplace, for example, and is often mandated by either HOA or city regulations. You can spend a load of time keeping your yard in order or you can pay and have the time back. \n\nBecause the US is so driven by capitalism, money moves around much more readily, freely, and in some cases arbitrarily than other countries. \n\nWhere the extra pay does come in handy though (for an expat) is returning back to Europe.

It is out of order to ever inconvenience a pedestrian with your vehicle, car or bike - ask yourself how many times a day you have to stop walking to make sure a car isn't going to run you over. We just accept and expect it with cars.\n\nTraffic lights are only really useful for motor vehicles (high speed ebikes included), not pedal cycles going slow enough to stop easily. See any video of the Netherlands - bikes go all at once in multiple directions with no issue. I don't know about you but I've never seen a load of cyclists stuck dinging their bells at each other in a grid-lock. Worst case you can hop off and walk around.\n\nThe real problem is the prevelance of illegal ebikes and escooters. Specifically \u00a3100 bikes with a throttle, dodgy motor and battery duct taped on are riding on the few cycle paths we have at 30mph now, all the time, every day. I see people literally riding without a chain on their bike. They are basically motorbikes. Yes, a lot of these people do work for Deliveroo. The police don't care (or don't have the resources, whatever.)\n\nI am a full time cycle courier and I have been hit by cars 3 times, bike destroyed twice, once hit head on and nearly killed by a corner cutting mercedes driver on their phone - and only hit by a bike once. The bike crash scraped my finger a bit, we had a laugh and carried on. \n\nI think it would do everyone who drives some good to cycle in a UK city (not just London) for an afternoon to see how terrifying it is when you don't run the odd red. Double decker buses drive so close to my rear tyre I can feel them towering in the air behind me. If I work too often in a month I cough up black shit from all the fumes I'm forced to inhale in the city. Who knows if all the cycling I do actually benefits my health overall. 90% of drivers pull up or beyond the cycle box at traffic lights.\n\nCyclists are vulnerable underdogs stuck in a country that prioritises cars, almost everyone dislikes us in some way because we are stuck out of place without the infrastructure we should have, which would benefit everyone.","upvotes":-1,"created_utc":1678191658.0}]},{"title":"Just spent \u00a340 in Heathrow, Yo Sushi.

I think it does probably the best job of neutrality *most* of the time, or at least the best job of achieving \"report the news, don't create the news\". So when the story is covered by the FT, I think that's probably the best source in most cases - the problem being that most stories *aren't* covered by the FT as non-financial stories fall outside their remit\n\nFor general newspapers, there are some \"biased but not just purely ragebait\" options - the Guardian is the obvious one. It's left leaning but not outright ragebait. The Times being broadly the same on the other side, being right leaning but not outright ragebait. To be absolutely clear, here, **they are both quite biased**, but in a somewhat more honest and objective fashion. Which is to say, they're less prone to ragebait, more journalistic, and tend to wear their bias on their sleeves. It's bias, but it's generally more fair, useful, and honest bias that's easier to work with.\n\nThe Independent is arguably the most centrist and unbiased \"general news\" newspaper in the UK historically, although \"The  i\" was purchased by the Daily Mail a few years ago and I think is technically run as an independent concern but unlikely to be lacking in influence, and The Independent is now online only now after being purchased by a Russian oligarch. The jury's still out here, I think - historically it was a good source, but the ownership and business model has changed dramatically and so it's harder to judge their bias.\n\nPersonally I generally follow the Guardian and Times, while trying to consider their individual bias, in the hopes of getting both sides of the story from the least-ridiculously-biased sources.\n\nThe Sun, Mail, Express, News of the World are absolutely just toilet paper in a newspaper costumer. The Star and Sport have never pretended to be anything else.

How much they get depends on how good the bidding teams are, not the scale of the problem.

These often are the same people who grant planning permission. \n\nIf a route is very busy, has a lot of services underneath or is often used by emergency services, it will get flat denied to start with. It can take six months for the permit to be granted. If even it is granted at all around when the gas or water companies wish to tear up the road some more. The main reason for refusal is \"traffic will get worse\".\n\nThen you need to get the work teams together, so safety assessments, etc. Then your permit may still get pulled and by then it could be January, where the money is not spent in time, so it is pulled to spend on something else. The road continues to degrade to cottage cheese as people drive increasingly enormous vehicles on it to get through, and those trying to do the repair receive the complaints via the local councillors and MPs. \n\nThe complaints sre used to try secure funding again for the next year and doing shitty path repairs before the end of March.

They then find that going down the self-checkout road they need to dedicate more space to them to avoid the whole thing snarling up. \n\n You can, to an extent invest in self checkout technology to help speed things up through greater efficiency, but Aldi and Lidl's problem here is that with generally smaller stores and therefore fewer units so it makes less sense for them to sink a lot of money into them when compared to someone like Tesco who will be rolling out many more self checkout units.\n\nThere's also a question of losses from theft at self-checkouts.

Subtracting two stars for a policy of hidden service fees. \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2716\ufe0f\u2716\ufe0f 3\/5\"\n\nThis is basically a monetisation scam from London restaurants, and if you do nothing it'll spread. Personally, I don't want to endure the social awkwardness of asking people to take the service charge off of a bill, but frankly I feel badly for not taking more of a stand. Further, it's easy for a restaurant to \"write off\" the one or two people each day who \"complain\" as aberrant. If the community doesn't force restaurants to nip hidden fees in the bud, this will become the norm in the UK in coming decades.\n\nI have noticed many residents of the UK taking pride in the fact that VAT is included in the prices on menus - even though that makes the prices seem higher at the risk of potentially deterring customers. Further, UK residents will often tease Americans for their tipping culture and how destructive it can be to the service industry when allowed to continue. This service charge policy that's spreading through London over the course of decades can lead to a very similar circumstance.\n\nLet me be clear, I am all for service industry. People being compensated well. I also lived in North America most of my life, where I was considered a pretty good tipper. I have worked in the service industry surviving off tips, And I have also worked in video game monetisation figuring out how to use social pressures to squeeze extra pennies from people. I love that service staff in the UK - and in London in particular - can be paid well. I'm not against service charges, But they should be included in the menu price.\n\nIf you want to charge \u00a312.50 for a sandwich then do so; just put that price on the menu. If you want a policy whereby you subtract 25% of your fees if someone wants to complain about the service, then go ahead and make that a policy in tiny print on the bottom of your menu. But do not put \u00a310 as the price on your menu then force your customers to go through an awkward situation in order to pay what you say it will cost. Otherwise you might as well start adding up other fees. I've seen a pub that has a mandatory \u00a31 per pint fee on top of their service fee (and multiplied by their service fee, so it's a \u00a31.13 fee) in a second line of small print.","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1678640150.0},{"author":"Pegasus2022","text":"My mum and me went into a fish and chip shop the other day they didn\u2019t add service charge on so we gave them a tip instead.","upvotes":0,"created_utc":1677366895.0}]},{"title":"The lack of public transport in the night, just had to pay \u00a345 to get home because there\u2019s no trains or buses","author":"Jacktheforkie","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/britishproblems\/comments\/11c425h\/the_lack_of_public_transport_in_the_night_just\/","text":"I\u2019m not made of money","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1677381693.0,"comments":[{"author":"AutoModerator","text":"### **Reminder:** [Press the Report button](https:\/\/reddit.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/360058309512-How-do-I-report-a-post-or-comment-) if you see any [rule-breaking comments or posts.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/britishproblems\/about\/rules\/)\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Some of those doors are sentient I'm telling you! Here's my experience with doors.\n\nAutomatic Doors - often start opening with free flowing confidence, only to stutter halfway causing you to catch your shoulder on the way in. That's if they are working at all.\n\nSemi Automatic Doors - you know the ones, they have a sticker saying automatic door on them, so you walk towards them and nothing happens. You walk back a bit then forward a bit, and still nothing happens. You star jump at what you think is the sensor, still nothing. Then a staff member makes a frantic pointing gesture to a button on the wall that opens the door. For some unknown reason, it opens automatically when you leave without the need of a button.\n\nThe Heavy duty Door - no matter how gingerly you shut it, it sounds like you've stormed off from an argument. This door often bounces back and stays open. It also shatters windows when it shuts.\n\nThe Door of 2 speeds - this door starts off like the heavy duty door, aggressively shutting, but then about 9 inches from the close point, a mechanism kicks in to slow it down. No matter how hard you pull, the slowing down function actively resists you. You have no choice but to wait for it to close off its own volition. For the last inch, the door returns back to its aggressive shutting form and bounces back open.\n\nThe glass door - it's not a door, it's a window.

If you dont need to, put your balance in savings and use it. Pay it off at the end of the month on the day before your interest would hit with either your paycheck or the balance you just added to your savings. Set up standing orders\/direct debits so you cant forget.\n\nGet a credit card. Use 10-20% of your balance, if you can, but nothing more than you can pay back before the interest hits. Pay it off, in full, and again, set up direct debits or standing orders so it does it all for you and you cant forget and accumulate interest as a result.\n\nRinse and repeat, and you'll see improvements without having to pay interest.\n\nNow, here's my own advice from working in a bank and seeing people with high incomes, low incomes, big savings, no savings, and knowing how the bank functions internally. \n\nIf you have a low income, it is harder, no doubt about it, but if you have debt accumulated, TALK TO YOUR BANK. They earn nothing if you're not making payments and will never pay it back fully, and there are things you can do that the bank will help you with. Personal loans or 0% balance transfer credit cards exist for a reason, and can be used to benefit you.\n\nIf you struggle with impulse spending, create another current account. Set up your Netflix, Spotify, whatever subscriptions you have that are a fixed amount, and keep the balance of the account at 0. Let those payments take you into your overdraft, then set up a standing order from your main current account to pay it back in full every month. You are now borrowing and paying it back every month without even thinking about it. \n\nIt is difficult, the system sets you up for failure, and unless you work in banking or finance, these things are kept as mysteries to make money off you. Dont let them do it. \n\nFinally, check if your bank uses Round Ups. Every day, they take your total spending on your debit card, round up the loose change, and put it in a savings account. It'll build up quicker than you think, and the money is pretty much always instant access just in case you need it for something like. covering your overdraft\/credit card if you come up short that month.","upvotes":16,"created_utc":1677091672.0},{"author":"robotto","text":"No mortgage, no loans, no credit card debt and a healthy bank balance.. credit rating : \u201cgood\u201d","upvotes":16,"created_utc":1677088479.0},{"author":"EverydayRobotic","text":"I have a credit card I use solely with Google Pay for contactless, it then gets paid in full by direct debit each month.

He'd made a nest egg with some lucky bitcoin investments - when asked why he was working at our dead-end job he answered that he just...liked working. He used to work in heathrow airport (actually i believe that part, he was from surrey), which quickly morphed into him having trained RAF pilots but having some kind of esoteric physical defect that stopped him from actually being a pilot. He told some people that he used to be a lawyer or that he had a Masters in Law - i suspect it's possible that he did his work experience in a lawyer's office but no more.\n\nWhat was weirdest was when he talked about his family. We're pretty sure he had a wife as he was on the phone to her all the time on his break, though whether she was Danish, Swedish, or American was never totally established. And then one day he mentions a step-son out of nowhere, apparently ten years old and visiting from Denmark\/Sweden. Like, it's possible? But so strange never to mention him before. >!we also suspect he fabricated a pregnancy for... some reason... because we got an email from the boss one day saying his wife has had a miscarriage and not to bring it up because it was understandably upsetting, but he was his usual chipper bantering self the next day!<\n\nHad another guy like that in one of my first jobs like 16 years ago. We were only working with him for like a week but in that week we were regaled by the most ludicrous stories. Pretty sure he also had an army or air force story with a carefully crafted reason why he wasn't in the force himself. Same as the other guy it was all a game of one-upmanship.

The trick is to keep them in enough sunlight to grow but not so much they \u201cbolt\u201d ie start to flower.  Here\u2019s what the Royal Horticultural bods say. \n\n\nSeeds can be sown outdoors from spring to autumn, in a sunny or lightly shaded spot with free-draining soil. You can also sow into pots of multi-purpose compost.\n\nScatter the seeds thinly, cover with a little soil or compost, and water gently. Germination takes from one to three weeks.\n\nSow small batches every three or four weeks for a constant supply of leaves from mid-summer onwards.\n\nYou can extend your leaf harvests into early winter by sowing batches in autumn under cloches or in a low polythene tunnel.\n\nWhen growing coriander for the seeds, sow in full sun in spring or early summer to ensure the seeds ripen, and thin out seedlings to 10cm (4in) apart to give plants space to mature.\n\nGrow\nKeep the soil or compost moist, but avoid overwatering. Dry conditions can cause plants to bolt (or flower) prematurely.\n\nPlants don\u2019t normally need feeding, but the occasional application of a balanced liquid feed can be used as a pick-me-up.","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1676629939.0},{"author":"gigazero","text":"I use [https:\/\/www.thai-food-online.co.uk\/collections\/fresh-thai-herbs](https:\/\/www.thai-food-online.co.uk\/collections\/fresh-thai-herbs) you can get some great stuff from them, including things you wouldn't usually find in the UK supermarkets","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1676640474.0},{"author":"Dirtyspaceman69","text":"The Basil is bull shit aswell","upvotes":0,"created_utc":1676591606.0},{"author":"TheStatMan2","text":"It completely stands to reason but so is the basil.

The variety the supermarkets are currently selling as just *Basil* Basil doesn't have the characteristic smell and doesn't taste of much at all. \n\nI'd much rather they just accepted themselves and educated customers that decent Basil just isn't available all year round.

It was called 'Smart Working'. It was a rollout of many different things. BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) to allow for work emails etc on your own devices. Flexible working requests, but also, Working from Home. It was a concept that was considered equally-if-not-more productive than time in the office and was taking off in a lot of departments.\n\nSadly, it didn't take off in my department. Why? My boss (we'll call him Mr X) hated it. I remember being in a managers meeting, with other managers in my department and he stated he \"Didn't trust people at home to do the work required, if he wasn't there to see them\".\n\nFast forward two years and we know what happened. I'd left said London for Transport company prior to this, but I remember speaking with ex-colleagues who worked for Mr X during *those* two years. They hated it. He didn't like the fact he couldn't see his colleagues doing work and attributed *any* mistake, to not being in the office. Then would just take pot-shots at people he thought weren't pulling their weight, based on nothing more than intuition. He'd monitor Teams statuses and ask where they were if they were inactive after 10 minutes. Pure hell.\n\nSo I had a takeaway from this. When I led the Smart Working program, it was important to stress about measures. Measures are an easy way to ensure work is being done, without looming over people. Measures should be in place anyways, regardless of where one is working. So I decided to make sure my staff would understand their goals and when they were required. That a rather vague description of it, but it just gives managers confidence in how work is coming along. It's monitorable.\n\nNow, I'm a **BIG** advocate for WFH. I see no reason why jobs can't be 90% or more WFH for all office based employees. I tell my staff, in any job, I don't care where you do your work from, as long as it's done and on time. And that's not coming from a place of dictatorship. It's one of flexibility and understanding. You're paid for your experience and level of productivity. In my eyes, you're not paid to be paraded around the office like a show pony, for something that adds no level of productivity.\n\nI won't hire someone in a full-time position, when I know they don't have enough work to fill their full-time capacity either. I draw back to my days at London for ULEZ. Far too many people were hired in many a department, for no more than possible cover during holidays. This meant, you have umpteen FTE's, with ~~nothing to do~~ lots of spare time. Now, as a manager, you could possibly understand Mr X's position, worried that his staff were just being paid to sit idly by at home. Hard analysis of your department and what they do, would realise you only need 3 FTE's, not 6. That's another key aspect of the WFH puzzle.\n\nBut I digress. The problem we have nowadays, is that people are starting to get the announcement of more and more days required back in the office. Not learning a thing from the last two years.\n\nAnd why? Because for every Mr X in the world, you know there's thousands more. All with this archaic mindset that when they can't see their staff, they immediately jump to the assumption that their staff are sitting on their fat lazy arses, playing a game of \"let's see if I can get this peanut in my belly button\". \n\nIt makes me sick that this stigma of WFH hasn't been eradicated, unless you're a software developer where it's considered the norm. We've had people had their salaries reduced in companies where they wish to work from home full-time. Why? By that reckoning, do you pay more for people who commute further? \n\nWe still sit in Teams meetings when we're in the office. So the 'cohesion' route is just patter for senior management to make themselves feel good. All for what? To show our face? To take part in elevensies? We all work less when we're in the office, because we spend circa 2 hours commuting and half the time listening to Sophie's date last night, or how Linda's kids are doing at f-ing swimming lessons. Is it good for our mental wellbeing? Probably. Is it good for productivity. Probably not.\n\nPresenteeism then rears it's ugly head again. We have those who feel so guilty about taking a day off sick, they decide to spread their nasty disease around the office, all because Mr Senior Manager wants to see bums on seats.\n\nAll this, in the last year and I've yet to hear sound reasoning or see a graph that shows me \"Time in Office vs Productivity Output\" and a big upward trend....","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1676504272.0,"comments":[{"author":"deafweld","text":"Jesus fucking Christ, OP.

The entire argument against WFH is rooted in one thing; the economy surrounding everything that facilitates commuting to, and working in, an office.\n\nThat's why the whole 'Save Pret' thing was said because footfall wasn't hitting shops like it used to, and some companies realised they could save thousands a month in office rental fees by downsizing the space they require.\n\nThis then gets propagated by Mr X types who are so monumentally bad at people management that they feel the only way to ensure people are working and hit their own targets is to perch on people's shoulders, which just shows how little trust they have in the people they've hired to do the job they don't actually trust them to do.\n\nAnd finally there's the colleagues who work in an office for the 'social' aspect. Don't get me wrong, being around people is good for a lot of people's mental health, but they obviously can't do it on their own, so now everyone else has to commute and spend money to come in to an office so David can tell you his opinions on the war in Ukraine.\n\nI find the best thing to do is as soon as any company talks about revoking or downgrading WFH is to look elsewhere for a job that is WFH in the contract. Yes they can usually revoke it just like other companies, but hopefully it gives them enough information to start seeing a pattern.","upvotes":16,"created_utc":1676535090.0},{"author":"badalki","text":"I've been lucky.

This meant, you have umpteen FTE's, with nothing to do lots of spare time.

At lower levels, employees are measured on deliverables and things they produce. This type of work requires quiet time, very small collaboration effort and minimal distractions.

Never done that before so idk how confident I am. Honestly I just feel bad enough to want to take the L and life lesson and move on, but its also a lot of money and aside from not buying extra insurance I never actually did anything wrong.\n\nEnough of the sob story, here's what I have, might not be literally everything I have but this is off the top of my head:\n\n1) Recorded video proof of me packaging the trainers (usually incase buyers do a switcharoo or try to claim fake,) These go through ebays \"authenticity guarantee\" process anyway (seller ships to ebay > ebay authenticates > ships to buyer) but its still my habit.\n\n2) Pictures of my leaving my parcels in the ParcelShops delivery bag (also included my tracking receipt in the pic)\n\n3) Tracking numbers showing literally 0 updates after the initial scans at the parcelshop. Meaning Evri couriers didn't scan it or update competently at any point. here's a screenshot of what I mean https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/rCAQ8vo\n\n11:06 tracking update is me paying for it through ebay paypal\n\n12:21 tracking update is me scanning it at the local parcelshop and them scanning it and putting it in their delivery bag\n\nnothing after that. despite parcelshop owner saying courier always scans before taking. is this normal incompetence, or wtf?\n\n4) Conversations with their loss claim customer support. After creating the case (where I show proof of item value, tracking etc.) they resolved my claim after only a few hours, accepting they lost it and would send me the \u00a325. (claim investigations apparently take up to 90 days, this only took an hour or 2.) Maybe this shows they knew very quickly they were at fault?\n\n5) 100% positive feedback proof on ebay as well as convos with buyers and ebay. Idk if that helps with anything but I guess it shows i'm not a scammer and sell legit stuff with great service. I also have proof of another trainer transaction this week on eBay using royal mail special delivery instead. same process, same packaging. Only difference is the courier. That package arrived perfectly. Does this show the only variable here is the competance of the delivery service?\n\nBut I'm still not sure how I would navigate through the fact that I didn't purchase the enhanced compensation.

I check the tracking, seems like delivery got held up a bit, bad weather blamed but says delivered. Delivered yes but no photo proof that I'd also paid for. Told buyer to leave it with me and started to chase it up. Told it would be investigated.\n\nSeveral more days pass and the buyer is getting stroppy with me. He starts a refund claim against me through eBay, Packlink ask me to send him a form to sign to say he definitely didn't receive them, he tells me to FO as he is getting his money back from eBay. Sometime after that eBay rejected his refund claim as the tracking info said they were delivered. Funnily enough I get the signed denial of delivery form back from him after that.\n\nAll goes quiet for a bit, Packlink says it could take 30 days to resolve.\n\nMove on a few weeks and I'm told I'll be getting a refund + my postage costs. Great! Just out of curiosity I go onto the Evri tracking and see that they really have been delivered a week or two later with a photo!
