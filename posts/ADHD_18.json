Then sometimes, I retell the same to story to a DIFFERENT imaginary person.\n\nOr if I leave a conversation with someone, I'll start telling them in my head what I would've said or added on to something I say. I do it over and over again, knowing it's a waste, but unable to stop. \n\nI'll even draft reddit posts in my head, sometimes multiple. It feels like every story, argument, idea, opens up a new tab in my brain and I must \"complete\" it to close it. Writing that Reddit post or responding to a person becomes as pressing a duty (or more pressing) than things that are actual real duties. Yet most of my \"unfinished tab tasks\" are unable to be completed in real life, the conversation having past or never really intended to happen, so it just adds to my mental noise that I have all the time.\n\nDoes anyone else relate? Do you find meds make it stop? It drives me crazy sometimes, having all these mental \"tasks\" on top of a million real life ones, and being stuck unable to stop thinking things over and over again.",

I’m a mom to 2 beautiful kids and instead of spending time with them, half the time I’m either doom scrolling or doing something else.

The house is a dump otherwise. \n\nI woke up in the morning and started the usual scrolling but my brain was screaming at me to stop.

However, I feel as though sometimes her ADHD causes her to act in a way that makes me feel unappreciated.\n\nAn example was last night, when we planned to have a sleepover and watch some movies. She picked out two, and I picked out two. However, she talked through all of them and ignored the movies I picked out. She would explain the plot of the movie as we were watching it, recited every movie that every actor was in, talking about the taste of her fries, how hot an actor was, the last time she watched the movie, how her fries were cold, how she really was craving some popcorn… I think you get the point. The talking never stopped. \n\nWhen it came to the movies I picked out, she didn’t hardly comment on them. She just talked about her classes and other random stuff. It really hurt my feelings because when we had decided on the movies, all of my picks she had cringed at and tried to make me pick different ones. The same thing happened for the food for the night. The talking during the whole thing was the icing on the cake. She always talks about herself and ignores everything I want to say or do. \n\nI’m at a loss because she’s a really great person, I just need help trying to find a middle ground. I don’t know how to talk to her about how I feel, because I know that part of it isn’t her fault. She can’t help that she has adhd. Does anyone with adhd have any advice? \n\n(I will also add that she does have high functioning autism and anxiety, which definitely affects her as well. I have severe anxiety as well, and I don’t want to trigger any thoughts of feeling “too much” in her, because I know the feeling all too well. She’s not too much, I am just having trouble communicating with her.)",

Not just for ADHD but for Anxiety as well?\n\n**Me**: Not really but it’s nice to hear somebody else say it.\n\n**MD**: Well if it works for you I’ll send an email to your family doctor about starting a Vyvanse prescription, and i’ll also include that you have generalized anxiety as well.\n\n\nI. Am. So. Happy.\n\nI have been fighting so hard to have this happen and the entire conversation lasted 5 minutes. Going to be starting Vyvanse next week. I’m over the moon right now!!",

I only really   watch the  games when iam really invested emotionally than its amazing    experience stressfull, with lot of emotions i love games like that. When    i dont feel like it i just dont watch. When i think about it now i    watch sports for the emotions not for the beauty of the game itself. I    used to check stats of best games against strongest opponets of my    favourite team only sometimes i have watched the game itself after i    checked the results bcs i was interested how strong we were in the past.    I also like to check stats of players from my country in big leagues    once in a while because i feel proud when they represent my country    good.  So in short words i care about sports enough when its not   important game to check results and stats but when its important i watch   the whole game and enjoy it bcs iam emotionally invested. Is this    adhd like thinking ? Or do neurotypicals tend do this too ? Never heard  they are only watching stats or results of your favourite team from  casual sports fans.",

I’m not officially diagnosed, but I do have symptoms such as frequent fidgeting behavior, an inability to sit still for more than probably 3-5 minutes, “forgetting” certain information, disorganization, poor sense of time, and not being able to focus on one task for more than a maximum of probably 20 minutes. The thing about this that frustrates me sometimes is how I can’t even seem to focus on tasks that I like to do either and I always switch to something else. \n\nI see many people saying that they can hyperfocus on something for 3-4 hours, or they can read many books or articles on the internet that interest them and learn a lot of information from it. The thing with this is I have to be EXTREMELY interested in something like capturing every single part of me to do this, which rarely and I mean RARELY ever happens. I don’t have much motivation to dive deep or even gain a basic understanding of most topics, leading to me feeling like I’m lazy and should just force myself to try to learn, but my mind will be racing while I’m reading so I don’t pay attention to the point of getting a good understanding. \n\nThe amount of time it takes for me to do schoolwork with all honors and ap classes is so much and I have to break it up in so many increments that it takes me hours to do. This causes me to not have much time to find interests, hobbies, join clubs at school, etc. I want to get out more and I know I can and have faith in God that I can. \n\nI wanted to see if anybody could provide some studying habits that I could implement that could possibly help me or anything else I should do to make this at least little less overwhelming for me.\n\nI should probably also mention that I do take medication. I tried Straterra, but it intensified my negative thoughts and caused me even more worry and feelings of being overwhelmed. I’m on Ritalin 10 mg right now twice a day, but I feel like it is not helping that much and not really having much of a affect on the things I need it to affect. Let me know about other medication I should try or different dosing strategies/times I should try that could help me.\n\nAlso, if you want more in depth information, I made another post about a week ago and I received one piece of advice but I’m looking for more.\n\nThanks in advance ❤️",

The meds aren’t going to motivate you to develop healthy routines. The meds aren’t going to fix your entire existence. The meds aren’t going to magically make your career goals and dreams come true. \n\nThat’s YOUR job. \n\nWhat the meds will do, however, is give you the mental clarity and capacity to have control over your thoughts and life. \n\nLife is harder when you’re off meds but being on meds won’t absolve you from the fact that you have to put in work to make yourself happy. \n\nThis entire post is a result of me hyper focusing on the wrong thing, though. Im working on it lmao. I’m also writing this to remind myself that I’m responsible for the work that I have to do in developing good habits.\n\nTl;dr Your meds are a tool.

We’re both quiet and nerdy, and she is autistic (while I have ADHD). It is making my life feel more difficult though. When doing any tasks around the household already feels like big effort, it feels like extra effort to stay out of her way.\n\nBeing autistic, she’s very strict about things being in certain order. She will notice any difference and detail and let me know verbally. What am I doing, why is some item moved and when am I planning to move it back, why did I buy a product X, when am I planning to finish cleaning my fridge, what made the sound she heard earlier… She does not mean to say that these things were seriously bothering her, but I find it awkward to have to explain everything I do. I’d also love to be able to start bigger projects (like cleaning or baking) and complete them one step at a time, but I can’t litter the apartment with half finished work and the mess it makes.\n\nThis makes me want to hide in my room and never cook or begin bigger cleaning projects. When I get overwhelmed I hoard dishes, trash or laundry in my room to not have to perform anything under her watch and become a bother.\n\nI don’t know..

For me, time controls my life.

But on a day with no obligations, the same amount of time feels much longer. Or if I'm at work, I can't help but seeing the time often, and time just seems to drag. 20 minutes feels like an hour, while at home an hour feels like 20min. I spend entirely too much time worrying about the time and how long until the next thing will happen.\n\nI've been trying to change this, but it's hard I'm not sure how. What I want is to be able to wake up at 8am and use those hours before work or whatever it is to actually get stuff done, instead of trying to plan out or wait for the \"perfect\" time to start something. 8am-12pm is 4 hours, I can do a whole lot in 4 hours, so why does it feel like 1 hour.",

In what shithole did you get raised in made you think that was ok?\" She had a very shocked and appalled face almost like she thought I wasn't going to react to what she did. She murmured something under her breathe trying to excuse it by saying i wasn't listening to her but i continued on saying some pretty expletive things. My coworker came over and finished her order up while I went on to the next guy who was very respectful and apologized that I had to deal with that.\n\nMy manager was pretty chill about it as well again I am not one to do that but snapping your fingers at a worker who just didn't catch what you said? I was wondering if adhd contributes to these emotional outbursts I have, I might have to go back on adderall just for work at least.",

        "text": "Hi,\n\nI'm new here but I just wanted some help or advice on how to deal with Elvanse crashes. I was diagnosed with ADHD last summer and was put on methylphenidate which really didn't agree with me...horrible headaches and anxiety. I was changed to Elvanse and things have been going well. I'm still in the trial period so slowly increasing my dose. I'm currently on 40mg and have been for about a month and things were fine until last week when I started getting really sad mid-way through the day. I didn't think much of it at first but it's happened every day since and each day it feels worse. It's a weird feeling of restlessness/hopelessness with a strong urge to cry. It lasts about 2 hours and then I'm back to normal again but I've noticed if I drink a coffee or eat something sugary I can make it go away faster. I thought maybe it could be cycle-related so I skipped my meds yesterday to see if I'd still experience feeling sad in the afternoon and I was fine all day. \n\nI just wanted to know if anybody else has experienced this and what I could do to help it? My dose is increasing to 50mg in a few days so maybe this will help. It's just an odd feeling and I'm struggling with it. \n\nI should add that I work as a live-in carer. The guy I care for lives in a separate area of the house and doesn't like company so I'm alone most of the time during my weeks on shift. It's never bothered me  too much in the past but I wonder if not having a lot of work to do and being alone isn't the best mix with Elvanse. \n\nAny help or just sharing your experiences would be really appreciated. Thanks &lt;3",

Basically something I've noticed is that I'm not very sensitive to heat but seem to be more sensitive to the cold. \n\nSomething which made me think of this was a science experiment my class did a while back. The door and windows were shut and there were 8 bunsen burners in the room. We had to wear these big lab coats with a high collar because we were working with bacteria. I was wearing 2 layers under the lab coat (t-shirt and shirt) and was just chilling in the room but some people had to leave the room because it was so hot. It got to the point where the teacher opened the windows (they're electronic) and I immediately felt cooler despite not feeling the heat at all. I had to put my hand like a foot away from a straight up open flame to feel the heat from it\n\nAnd at home I need to physically touch the radiator to see if it's on. I think it's related more to ambient (?) temperature like climate and room temperature because I can feel things like hot water when I put my hands in it etc \n\n\nIs this normal at all?",

        "text": "Had a great session with my psychologist last week. At the end, I asked him if he thinks I might have ADHD and without hesitation he says ‘oh yeah, most likely’. \n\nI have an assessment booked in a few months, with an ADHD psychiatrist. Very excited but also nervous. \n\nSo I guess, what now? Every sign points to ADHD. School reports all say the same thing, it’s incredibly spooky how patterned every report is. It has the usual ‘has potential but won’t apply himself’ or the ‘either focuses and creates amazing work or doesn’t seem to bother at all’. Constant discipline and shame for ‘behaviour issues’. So sensitive, especially to criticism and rejection in school/life. Another classic was not being allowed to go to the formal dance in high school unless I finished all of my backed-up homework throughout the year. Thank the lord for my cousin coming in and doing my work (Mum paid her so I could go lol). However, I excelled in Music &amp; Sports. Produced top marks consistently. Funny that… I have a deep love for both. No wonder I applied myself. \n\nThe list goes on and on, it’s just surreal how everything I am reading is like ‘oh wow, I do that’ to almost everything posted on this sub. \n\nHow do I sit tight and count down the days? 3 months wait it is. Would love any advice for those who have felt uncertain before the assessment, if possible  Life has felt unbearably hard throughout my whole life. It’s like i’m so far behind in life, like I’m wading through deep water trying to catch up while others walk on shallow ground. And i’m always TIRED. Anyway, that’s all for now, big thanks to anyone who feels like giving any advice. Much appreciated. \n\nTL;DR: Psychologist says ‘more than likely’ that I have ADHD. How can I cope for the next 3 months until my official assessment? Nervous, excited. Also feeling like an imposter. Any advice would be truly appreciated!",

What the fuck does any of that mean? I feel like it's all sentences without any single definition and people just understand it and I just feel stupid because I'm 26 and I cannot grasp this concept. I told my friend I zoned out and drove 20 minutes past my exit before I realized and he responded \"mindfulness dude, gotta practice it.\" WHAT DOES MINDFULNESS HAVE TO DO WITH THAT? I just zone out! It's normal, everyone with ADHD does it all the time. \n\nI thought it was getting rid of thoughts and stuff and was like I can't do that, my brain jumps tracks so much that it gets rid of them for me. But no it's just recognizing them? But I already do? I'm aware of the thoughts and then people say \"pay attention to how you feel\" yeah I am. I have CPTSD and have to do that for my cognitive behaviour. I always pay attention to how I feel. It takese a minute sometimes but I'll realise how I feel fairly quick. And then they're like \"let go\". Let go of what???? The thought? The feeling? What am I letting go of? I don't really care how average thoughts make me feel, but the thoughts from my trauma I can't just \"let go\" of. \n\nI just don't get what people are telling me to do. I already know how to slow my mind down and catch a thought, but it's not meditation I have to listen to specific music that helps drown out the other thoughts and calms me. It works for me, I don't care about slowing down my mind at other times too much. I already pay attention to how I feel. The only one I can think of is daydreaming cause I maladaptive daydream as a coping mechanism for CPTSD but mindfulness isn't a cure for that, I gotta work through my trauma for more CBT. \n\nAm I missing something? I have tried just sitting and focusing on my breathing and thoughts and \"not judging them\" when I get bad thoughts (trauma memories) but all it does is make me focus on them more and stress me out and upset me. My tactic has always been to distract myself and they go away. Am I supposed to do it with regular thoughts too? I don't get it. I have read so much and just don't understand.",

For almost a year I was on elvanse/vyvanse, settling at 40mg and 5mg dex booster for most of this academic year. My grades improved significantly and I owe a lot of this to the medication. However, it made me feel like a drone and fairly anti social, I didn't really want to speak to my housemates and I was sometimes blunt and irritable on the phone. It got to a point where I was completely sick of feeling this way and asked my psychiatrist to change me back to Concerta.\n\nI have been on 36mg for around a month now and while I feel a lot more myself, my productivity and motivation for uni is significantly worse than before, I've had this whole week off and have done very little work, I also have a deadline tomorrow which is nowhere near ready. I can tell the medication does improve focus somewhat, and I think if I was not at university this dose would be fine, but it is simply not enough for the level of focus required for my coursework.\n\nI genuinely do not know what the solution is short or long term, the only thing I can think of potentially is having a low dose XR to get me through the day and then taking a short release when I need to get work done? I tried this briefly with elvanse/vyvanse and it seemed to impact my tolerance fairly quickly.\n\nI was wondering if anyone had thoughts or insight on this? My psychiatrist is completely fed up with me at this point and doesn't give me any help with deciding on the right dose, so I have just been going round in circles stressing about it everyday for months.",

        "text": "Hi everyone, sorry this is gonna be a long one, I (20s F) just wanted to ask here as I'm not sure if this is something that other people with ADHD experience, or if it's possibly more related to my OCD or something else entirely. Basically, I have trouble forming attachments to other people, and I don't know if it's something that can be fixed.\n\nI'll give you an example; I worked in my first job for about 7 years, I was friendly with people and made sure to attend work events (like Christmas parties) to socialise with my coworkers. When the pandemic happened I ended up getting a second job until work picked up again for the first one, when it didn't I just sent an email to my boss saying that I'm resigning and thank you for employing me (for context I was on a zero hours contract, which meant I was able to leave without giving 2 weeks notice). My old boss was nice about it, he sent an email back thanking me for my work and that he wished me all the best for the future... The issue was that I just didn't have the urge to reach out to my other coworkers, people I'd worked with and got along with for 7 years, I didn't say goodbye to any of them and I didn't feel sad about never seeing them again, I still don't miss any of them.\n\nI know that's probably a bad thing, and the same thing is happening again in my new job. We recently had two staff members who left for other jobs, both who I was friendly towards and got along with, but I didn't have the urge to say goodbye to them or attend their leaving party, and again I don't miss them now that they're gone.\n\nIt's not just with work relationships though, it's also happened with my old (so far one and only) romantic relationship too. I loved spending time with my ex and was happy to be with him, however I'm not really a touchy-feely person, I hate kissing and would've just preferred to hug or hold hands instead. I get that we weren't compatible, he wanted to be more intimate and I was happy with how things were (this led to me questioning my sexuality, and I still am years later), and when he said we should break-up I just agreed with him. We ended on good terms, but again I never had the urge to talk to him after that, or to try and convince him that we could 'fix' the relationship, we broke up and I immediately moved on with my life.\n\nI don't know what to do about this detachment issue. I know I should feel something for the people I can never see again, that I should be grieving the end of the relationship or something like that. Don't get me wrong I DO grieve for the loss of family members and animals, and I do feel empathy for other people that are experiencing a bad time, I just don't understand why I feel nothing when a relationship ends with most other people. I say most others because I actually did feel upset about losing someone I considered to be a best friend, who suddenly stopped contact out of nowhere a couple of years ago, not just with me I might add but with the other people in our friend group too (we didn't end on bad terms with her as far as I'm aware, like I said she just stopped answering our calls and messages, we can't find her on social media either so we have no idea why she stopped).\n\nBut anyways, I think most of the emotional detachment that I have towards other people has been influenced a lot by my past traumas, I'm just not sure if my ADHD is exacerbating it, because of the whole emotional dysregulation thing that often comes along with ADHD. Is this something that anyone else has experienced? Did you find anything to help you work through this? Again I'm sorry for how long this post is, any answers or advice you may have are greatly appreciated.",

Today after searching for some time I asked my father if they still had it. He said I should probably have it because it is my card. I responded I didn’t have it because they were the last ones to use it.  Then I explained again they used it with the example of when they went and he said “don’t shout at me, just ask your mom instead” in return I did actually get mad because in my opinion I was just being clear by perhaps raising my voice a bit.\n\n\nSo this happens quite a lot.. am I just not aware that it may be perceived as aggressive? I’m aware I my emotions can get intensive but only after a trigger like being accused in this example…",

Many times it may be an optimization of medication, less cluttered environment but this is not it.\n\n❓This is for anyone looking to increase productivity through software / apps since we happen to live in a digital age.\n\n❌You will clutter your life and start almost to vomit if you don’t get this one right and start working fulltime. I had to go through hell to get this one nailed down and this one has worked, and also 6-7x’d my productivity. \n\n❄️My Reference: I used to work as a Cloud Solution Architect in a FAANG company, then left building my own business.\n\n✅Multiple that has helped me so far: \n\n📅if you have calendar or more -&gt; gather them in one place on Outlook / Apple Calendar. Set Notifications -&gt; «On» in calendars to 5 mins prior to all events. \n⭐️Use Calendar to ultimately remove the delayed consequence. Move stuff around if you have to. \n⭐️Use Calendar in combination with Motion app, 6$ but very worth it. It’s a projects, tasks kind of scheduler built with AI. \n\n-Auto-schedules tasks where it thinks you will have the best time. \n\n-It breaks a task into 1/2 or 1/4 and you can also decide this yourself. Mark complete. \n\nUsing 📅Calendars with 🌠Motion &gt; Sunsama from my experience.\n\n—————-1\n🌀Task Prioritization - take a list of paper and note down «important» and «difficulty» tabs at the top of the page. Divide with a line down the middle. \n-Write out all the tasks (microtasks) you have for now and 2 weeks FORWARD.\n\n🔚- Finished? - \n1. on the left tab, mark it on a scale of 1-10 on importance; 10 being MOST important. \n2. on the right tab, mark it on a scale of 1-10 on difficulty; 10 being EASIEST to perform.\n\nNow:\n➕Add the numbers for each task.\n📃Create a new list, starting with 20, COUNT DOWN.\n\n🔹You can now execute on the TASKS that matter first and will live by this list. You may add CHECKBOXES.\n\n🔹If tasks become the same, mark them with .05 or 0.2 so that there is always a priority. \n\n‼️If you can’t get to start the task, or complete one task at once, divide it into max 3 new tasks and prioritize them under.\n\n✨It can be vital to juggle between tasks sometimes as it may be demotivating NOT FINISHING. \n\nIn this case, set timer or Calendar notification &amp; Move Back to the other task.\n——\n👁For Entrepreneurs, employees that need immediate help or want further guidance / other tips for day-to-day that i’ve not included here , reply and i’ll see how I can help 😄",

        "text": "Lately I‘ve been feeling a bit frustrated with my adhd. I can try as hard as I want to, but no matter how much time I plan to prepare for something, I always end up late. I‘m known to be late in my entire family and friend group so I‘ve had people tell me the wrong time to make sure I‘d be there in time for the actual event. While I think it‘s a genius move from them and can somewhat appreciate it (also because being on time for a change is so relaxing), it also feels like everyone just expects me to „fail“ time management wise. Similarly I‘ve forgotten birthdays, gifts etc etc and at this point no one is mad at me because they know it‘s just how I am. \n\nAt the same time this really hurts. Their expectations of me are so low I basically can’t disappoint them. My mom for example always does this thing where I‘ll tell her a time to meet and she reply’s with „so you‘ll be here *30min past scheduled time*“. It‘s so annoying but she is almost always right because SOMETHING always happens to make me late. I‘d like to correct myself: I always happen and make myself late. Can’t really blame them either because all my life I haven’t really managed to prove them wrong. I can try and plan the hell out of my day but I can never quite shake it off. Something always goes wrong.\n\nSo many hobbies I dropped, „life changing“ plans, ideas that were forgotten, unfinished projects, barely met deadlines… Sometimes I feel like the world expects me to fail and I can’t fight it no matter how hard I try.",

I have an appointment with a specialized psychiatrist next month. \n\nThe problem is that I'm wondering if I'm just being silly. I got 102 in verbal comprehension, 103 in working memory, 88 in perceptual reasoning and 86 in processing speed. I know that what is usually deficient in people with ADHD is working memory and that is not my case. I'm 22 years old, I've always felt dumb and been perceived as dumb. I worked as a waiter in a restaurant and my colleagues made remarks about the fact that I was too slow, that I always forgot what was asked of me, that I didn't understand the instructions, etc. Now I work in a communication agency and I have been told \"oh it was clever to work like that, I didn't think it was you\". Also, I don't reason as well as most of my friends and it shows when we debate together. I am often silent because I rarely have anything interesting to say. \n\nBesides that I have a lot of ADHD symptoms, I noticed that my dad does too but... You can have ADHD and be dumb, you can have no ADHD and just be dumb or you can have ADHD and look dumb without actually being dumb. It seems complicated to me to tell the difference but in any case I am really complexed by my intellect. \n\nIf people can relate to what I'm saying, I'd love to hear your thoughts.",

        "text": "I've recently been diagnosed and prescribed Vyvanse and it's been so helpful. I can focus and I used to have insane anxiety and the Vyvanse also really helps with anxiety for me as well and I also have been sleeping way better!! \n\nI'd like to hear from someone who's taken a similar medication for years because I'm to a point where I feel I may be on medication for my whole life. I'm currently 32. Has anyone had any mental or health problems from it? Or is it still keeping you feeling stable? Any thing would be helpful just want to know the long term effects from people who have actually taken something long term themselves! 🙏",

        "text": "I don't often act very impulsively except for when I buy some stuff online usually just fancier versions of things I normally buy (toiletries etc), but sometimes I just dont enjoy anything and I don't feel like I'm allowed to until I get my work done. No relaxed morning coffee until I'm showered and the dishwasher is unloaded. This is especially when I finally have a whole day meant for \"myself\" it's all or nothing. Cannot enjoy time until work is done. No fun until clutter is gone because how can I relax? Sometimes it means I don't eat until 2pm or so because the good times cannot start until I \"set the scene\" with a clean apartment. Does anyone else do this?",

        "text": "So I think I may have inattentive ADHD\n\nMy expression of symptoms seems to be an inability to plan anything out or to execute plans once thought out, I can't do things like play chess or magic the gathering with any degree of skill because my mind wanders and I just forget that I even had a plan, I just go into autopilot, this is certainly inattentive but whether it could represent ADHD I'm unsure of\n\nI definitely have severe issues focusing but I really don't have the whole constant unrelated thoughts thing going on and while my mind is always doing something I'm not sure it's excessively distracted as such, more just not paying attention and not really able to\n\nAlso methylphenidate focuses me but it doesn't feel like my mind is calming down, just focusing, zoning in kind of\n\nDoes this sound familiar to anybody or does this likely mean I should be looking at other options?\n\nI'm not looking for a diagnosis or anything just some indication if anybody can relate to what I've said here\n\nApologies if this sounds a bit ignorant I've been researching sporadically for about a week but I'm not that clued up yet, any insight appreciated",
