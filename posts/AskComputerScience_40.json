Should I be setting up a DNS server on Linux (Bind)? If a computer joins the network, will it be able to self-declare itself to the DNS server and then be pingable by name from other computers using said DNS server, or will I have to add any new computers to the DNS server myself?\n\nWould something like the above only work in conjunction with DHCP, or could I give a computer a static IP and still expect its self-declared name (\"muppets-pc\" etc) to be resolvable?\n\nOr would it all be simplier if I just enabled NetBIOS or some other server-less name thingy on the Linux computers (if that even makes sense in this context)?\n\nDisclaimer: I am actually pretty good with networking and computing generally, it's just that name resolution is one of my blind spots.",

In the end I passed the class with a high B, but I had to sacrifice sleep and a bit of social life in the process.\n\n\nThis semester I'm taking Calc 2.

I understand that a sacrifice in social life, sleep WILL be needed to an extent.....but if it's going to get out of control and unmanageable down the road, maybe I should rethink my strategy now.\n\n\nAssume the following in determining if I can handle it:\n\nI'm a B student in math, have a &gt;3.0 overall GPA, committed, resourceful, focused, some people say I'm pretty smart, I'm at the top of my game as a network engineer.\n\n\nWith that, can it be done without losing myself in the process?\n\nThank you!",

I'm taking a programming languages class now and am unable to see the professor until Tuesday, when this assignment is due so I was hoping someone might possibly be able to clarify a few things, though there might simply not be enough context. I received an assignment where I'm supposed to write a Perl program that will determine if line segments intersect. There are supposed to be two classes, Point and LineSegment.\n\n\nPoint should be composed of a constructor, getX, getY, setX, setY, setXY, and random (assigns random values to X and Y within their appropriate ranges). \n\n\nLineSegment should be composed of a constructor, getA, getB, setA, and setB.\n\n\nThen there will be a main function hat takes two line segments as parameters and determines if they intersect. \n\n\nI'm primarily wondering if anyone could help me understand why so many functions are needed for the first two classes and what each is actually supposed to do. I haven't been able to figure out why you need both get and set functions. I also don't understand what setX and setY would do since random sets the values or what setXY would even do. In addition, I'm completely confused about what constructor functions should contain and how the line segment class works. He did not provide a lot of context and I'm not familiar with the language so I was hoping someone might be able to follow his thinking better than I can.",

Here is my situation:\n\nI am finishing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science this year, and have the opportunity to pursue a Masters degree in Applied Computing or Computer Science, at the University of Toronto. Both programs are 18 months long. The Computer Science one involves a thesis and the Applied Computing one requires an internship for the last 8 months, instead of a thesis. My dilemma is this - Personally, I am probably more into the Applied Computing program, since it does NOT require as much academia work as the more research oriented Computer Science program (thesis, research with professors on projects etc.). I am not considering going into academia or pursuing a PhD. The problem that I have though, is that for some reason I believe Computer Science is the more prestigious of the two (please correct me if I am wrong, this is limited to my current understanding) and my bias, since I am currently finishing a BSc in Computer Science and am not that informed on Applied Computing. Will it even matter which one I choose in regards to job opportunities etc., since they are both covering very similar aspects, and what are the primary differences that I can expect?",
