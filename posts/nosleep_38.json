        "text": "That next day I called out sick from work. I googled “churches” on Google Maps and found one a mile from my home. Too sick to eat or even think about anything other than this entity that had taken over my life, I went to the corner store next door and bought the largest Redbull available for purchase. I left the convenience store on a mission; I was going to use my day to evoke a higher power, one that humans for thousands of years had turned to for the things that were more powerful than their understanding. Yet before I was able to set off on my journey, something gave me pause. It had been there for longer than I had been living in this apartment, and I had no doubt walked right past it countless times. But why didn’t it show up on my google search? I walked over to the large gothic looking building that had “St. Augustine est. 1892” written on it in crumbling stone. The for-sale sign outside of it was paired with an additional sign stating, “Private property: No Trespassing.” I marveled for a moment at the abandoned, beaten down church. I had never seen a church for sale before, it struck me as odd. There wasn’t even a name listed for the agency who owned the listing of the property, just a phone number. I stood on my tip toes to get a better look inside. The weeds and foliage had started to retake back what land was always and will forever be there’s. The stained-glass windows in the cathedral where masterpieces that bathed the pews in colorful light from the mid-morning sun. The place was haunting and beautiful just like the pictures depicted in each of the stained glass. \n\nThe walk to the church from my internet search was a blur. I could not control all the wicked and wild thoughts in my head. So many questions with no bastion for me to cast off from in a sea of confusion. I stared up at the church on the aptly named Church Street with hope in my heart that my first visit to a church since I was just a boy was fruitful in casting away what demonic presence had plagued my last few months.  Inside it was what most churches looked like during off hours, empty, haunting, beautiful, powerful.\n\n“There isn’t a mass scheduled for today. Can I help you son?” A priest emerged from behind a wooden carving of the virgin Mary to the right of the altar.\n\n“Oh, Father I’m not here for mass. I actually… have something very strange to ask you.”\n\n“Excuse my terminology, but you look like Hell. What is wrong?” He gestured for me to take a seat.\n\nIt did not occur to me until that very moment that I had prepared nothing for this encounter. What was I to say to this man of the cloth? How could I describe my situation to someone who was not immersed in the surrealistic nature of it all?\n\n“I… have something to ask you about that not about God.”\n\n“Okay, well why don’t you just go ahead and ask it.” \n\nThe priest was old enough to be my grandfather.  He had a mystique about him only acquired through years of having other people speak their troubles at him. Every time I looked up, he was starring right into my eyes. I could not keep his gentle gaze. My discomfort with the subject at hand must have been evident because he prompted me again before I could speak.\n\n“This is not the first time someone has come to me with something they themselves thought to be ridiculous. There is nothing as such on this Earth. God can help with any mortal matter.”\n\nHesitantly I asked, “What about those matters which are something… other than mortal.”\n\nThe old man was unflinching. He calmly replied, “Ah, I see, so it is a matter of something otherworldly? Would this be an inquiry into the ungodly that is always present in our world?”\n\n“Always present?”\n\n“Yes, of course.  In my experience, there is always balance required in all things. One does not experience light without also experiencing dark.”\n\n“I think there’s something dark that has... latched onto me. I know it sounds crazy, but for over a month now *something* has been… I don’t know, *haunting* me.”\n\nThe old priest’s facial expression did not budge. “Describe to me the entity. Withhold no details. Wait! First.”\n\nThe old man got up and locked the doors to the church. After his return I told him all about what I had been seeing.\n\n“Did this entity,” he asked, “*say* anything to you? Has it given you any indication of what it wants?”\n\n“My pain,” I explained, “ever since it has started talking to me all it keeps saying over and over again is that it wants my pain. It told me if I don’t give it my pain, then it will cause me to experience more pain then any human can bear- “\n\n“Which would only make you all the more appealing to it.”\n\n“Yes! It said that too.”\n\nThe old man’s brow furrowed, and he let out a deep sign, it felt like it was anger that drew the sigh instead of pity or anything else. Then he got up, disappearing behind the wood carved Virgin Mary. I couldn’t help but look up at her. She looked down at me with those engaged yet impartial eyes. It was as if she were saying, “not even I can help you in this fight, go with God.” \n\nThe old priest returned, slamming a book down before me. \n\n“I know this entity of woe and despair. Tell me, have you experienced a great loss in your life? A tragedy that would leave your soul scarred. It won’t help you beat it, but it would confirm what we are dealing with.”\n\nI told the priest about the drunk driving accident that took my parents from me when I was barely old enough to recognize what had happened. How they found me with my dead mother’s head in my lap. My grandparents bringing me to court in my tiny suit, watching the man who killed my parents after too man pina colada get sentenced to life in prison. My kindergarten all chipped in to try and help me morn a loss I could not accept had even occurred. How the foster care system in this country quickly taught me how to forget the past in favor to accepting the eternal Now because no one could survive such an experience without this sacrifice. I told him about a part of my life I spent 99% of the time since forgetting ever happened.\n\nHe was frowning, “I’m so sorry. I will do whatever I can to help you. First, I need you to understand a few things about the mortal and immortal world as I know it.”\n\nWith this his body language changed from that or pity to a more direct posture. “We all like to believe,” gesturing the church and every human outside of it, “that there is a good and evil in this world. A god and the devil. The angels and the demons. I spent my life in service to our lord, so I am including myself in this as well. But I cannot deny what I know to be empirically true based on my experience dealing with the immortal, or the world beyond our own physical world. Speaking from that standpoint, and not a priest of the church, there is no hierarchy that I can see among the things beyond our understanding. There are just simply those entities that are good, bad, malicious, mischievous, malevolent, and all the like. The evil entities do not punish the evil humans, the evil beings do not punish the good ones, the good ones don’t always help the good people, the good one do not always punish the evil. There is no moral compass that I can see when it comes to entities of the other realms of existence.\n\n“Here’s what I do know. Those entities that would act maliciously towards you have some qualities that are common amongst them. First, all evil entities are more powerful, one might even be able to say more ‘*real*’ in our world when it is colder. Those tropes in movies about ghosts being a cold presence are true. Something about our world being colder allows them to exist here more freely.”\n\nThis all washed over me in a wave of prophetic awe. The entity had gotten more bold, more real as the temperature dropped. The nights were colder than the days; November was colder than October, and December was colder than both of them. That night when I saw those glowing eyes from the roof of my neighbor’s house was the first time it dropped below freezing. The night I let the monster into my apartment was the coldest night of the year so far.\n\n“Where do you live?” The priest asked.\n\n“I live over on High –“\n\n“-land street” the priest finished, “That’s what I would expect. The second thing I know is that places of worship, those places in our world where humans gather to express combined faith are like imprints of the other world beyond. As I said before, you cannot have the light without the dark, the good without the evil. Churches and places of worship *do* attract the attention of virtuous deities like angels. But for the same reason they are attract malevolent demons. St. Augustine’s has been abandoned for over 40 years now and it has continued to be a beacon for entities, almost entirely of the evil kind. Virtuous deities are more drawn to those places where faith is actively being practice with the goal to attract them. But St. Augustine has no active worshippers. It still is imprinted on their world, and always will be, but the spirits that are willing to go there are more malevolent in lieu of their being more commonplace for worshipers in this world of the malevolent kind.  You are not the first person who lives close to St. Augustine’s to come in here since it closed. I remember that day it closed.”\n\n“What happened?”\n\n“It’s a story for another time.”\n\n“How many people have come here?”\n\n“Being the closest church to St. Augustine, I can imagine we get most of the people like you who are affected, but there’s no way to know for sure.”\n\n“How many?”\n\n“In the forty years since it’s closed? I don’t know, I don’t keep a tally, but somewhere in the figure of 200.”\n\n200 people. 5 unlucky people a year. And those are only the one’s who arrive here, at this church, courageous enough to fight. Stupid enough to look for answers. \n\n“This entity that has attached itself to your soul, I have only known two other people who have had it. The entity want’s the pain you experienced in loosing your parents, it finds the grief you felt since to be the most enticing form of sustenance. Your heartbreak only gets better as you age, this entity will not stop until it can consume it.”\n\nA worm squirmed in my stomach, twisting and turning, desperate to get out. I could barely ask.\n\n“What happened to them? The two before me.”\n\n“They gave it what it wanted.” The priest sighed. He steadied himself. “I am sorry. This entity takes your pain away, but in loosing that pain, you lose everything. Many of those who have these entities attach to their souls arrive as you did. This is their first time in a church for as long as they can remember. I am no one to them. For many of them, I have no idea what happened. I have no idea if they survived, became possessed, died horribly, or anything in between.” He paused, seemingly losing his train of thought, starring off into the distance, “I volunteer at the local hospital, Mount Ossipee. Many people in hospitals need priests. I started my time volunteering there to help those who needed strength or a path to the world beyond. But since St. Augustine closed, I kept going for another reason. I only see a fraction of the people who arrive here talking about dark entities eventually end up there, but it is the only way I can try to find out what happened to them. That and the obituaries, which a larger percentage show up in. The two that have been here before with this same entity both arrived at Mount Ossipee. Neither of them I could say ‘*fully*’ arrived there.  You see, pain is normally seen as a bad thing in our society. Turn on your television for more than 10 minutes and you will be inundated with adds for treatments to essentially get rid of pain. It doesn’t matter if its physical pain, mental anguish, spiritual decay; all these can be relieved if you are willing to pay for it. But without pain, there is no reference point for every other experience on the spectrum. Like light and dark, bliss can only exist with pain, anguish, suffering, anguish, torment etc. Life does not exist without pain.\n\n“When these men arrive at Mount Ossipee I had never seen anyone more dead while still having a pulse. It was as if someone had scooped out all the essence from their body and soul, leaving a decaying husk that could only be seen as waste. All the light from their eyes had gone. I have no idea how long after they gave the entity their pain they turned into these husks, but I can assure that they did give it exactly what they wanted.”\n\n“So, what do I do if I can’t give it what it wants? How do I get rid of this thing!?” I started to feel my panic rising. \n\nThe priest shook his head in sorrow. “I don’t know. I haven’t had enough experience with an entity like this, so I have no reference for anyone who has had success against it. The only thing I can tell you with 100% certainty is that you cannot give it your pain. Whatever you do, you must hold onto your pain with everything you have, or the same thing will happen to you.”\n\nThere was not much left for me to speak with the priest about. He could not give me the answers that I needed to face this thing. He did send me on my way with a jewel encrusted cross, 2 vials of holy water, and a bible. He told me that he was sorry he couldn’t help me but hoped that these items may aid in some way. I was no better off at that time than when I had arrived at the church, besides possessing the assurance that there were others suffering the same fate and the solace that I was not crazy. \n\nThat night the forecast called for temperatures to drop into the teens for the first time that winter. I was almost certain that this malicious entity would not let the opportunity slip through its grasp. I knew it was coming, but I still had no idea what I would do when it arrived. I knew only one thing for certain, I could not under any circumstances surrender my pain to it. The priest had made it clear that my pain was a fundamental part of who I was, and that losing it was paramount to losing myself. That misconception that these men of the past had mistakenly seen as a blessing was the entity’s true genius. A small comfort was that I was the only person to have faced this entity yet armed with such knowledge. But even then, there still stood the fundamental question; if I could not give the entity what it wanted, what was there that I could offer it in return? How could I refuse the offer? I felt helpless in the wake of these questions. Sleep did not come easily despite my best laid plans. I thought about sleeping with a weapon by my bedside but decided against it. There was no flesh for me to strike with a blade or bludgeon. In my last meeting I had fallen physically paralyzed by the sight of the beast.  There was no reason for me to believe that wouldn’t happen again. Instead, I knew the only weapon I could use was my mind. I would need to think my way out of this, hope for a miracle, or more likely utilize a combination of both. It was right in the middle of that thought that sleep finally took me.\n\nThere was no *THUD* on my door that night. I was simply asleep, and then I was awake, feeling consciousness pulled from me like a snake from its burrow. This feeling of being pulled backward into the light. The forces that bound me raised me into a seated position in the bed. At the foot of my bed was the old man with his back facing me. I can’t explain it, maybe it was my having unwrapped the mystery a little since out last encounter, but the presence coming off of the entity felt weaker somehow. A thought occurred to me; what if the entity was starving? What if, just like us mere mortals, hunger could weaken it? ‘*ARE YOU READY TO GIVE ME WHAT I WANT?*” the voice howled. The voice was summoned from a vocal range beyond that available to human vocal cords. It sounded like the horrid wailing screams from all our meetings prior, but more panicked. There was a frantic nature to its tone. Its hold over me was still too strong for me move, run, attack. I screamed back because it was the only thing I could do, “NO!” “*GIVE ME WHAT I WANT!”* This time the screams were louder than they had been before. The man turned around, eye’s glowing so bright and wild. \n\nHe hopped onto the bed. “*YOUR PARENTS ARE DEAD! THEY ARE HERE IN THE WORLD BELOW!* *THEY DON’T MISS YOU THEY NEVER LOVED YOU!*  *THEY BEGGED FOR THEIR DEATH!*” The old man was now mere feet from me getting closer with each second.  The old man was now mere feet away from me and getting closer with each blood drenched step. I could see his crooked mouth full of daggers, the dried blood clinging to scraggy facial hair. His eyes grew brighter, “*GIVE IT TO ME!*” “NO!” I screamed back. We were face to face now. I could smell its rotting breath, it took all my power to keep my stomach. “*GIVE ME YOUR PAIN NOW OR I WILL SHOW YOU SUFFER YOU COULD NEVER IMAGINE!”* “NEVER!” “*NOW!*” “NO!” Then the voice from somewhere inside this evil spirit said, “then take mine.” It was not the voice of a demon but a man. The old man in that instant grabbed my head on both sides. I could feel the crusted blood from his fingers against my face. And then I was gone. I had left my bed and was now somewhere *else* entirely.  It was a profound darkness no one could describe in any language we mortals speak. \n\nI hung there in the infinite darkness. It was only a moment, yet it felt like an eternity. Then I was lying on the floor of a dirty bathroom. I couldn’t look around, nor could I even feel the physical body I was in. A bottle of Drain O lay on its side in front of me pour its toxic contents slowly onto the floor in an ever widening, wait, shrinking pool. It was then that I noticed the liquid was going from the floor back into the bottle. The liquid became entirely removed from the floor and the bottle jumped into my hand. The bottle hit my hand at the same time when the body I was in started to rise. I was standing with the Drain O to my lips, the blood from inside of me was retreating back into my body. The body lowered the bottle and I saw in the mirror who I was inhabiting. It was the old man. He placed the bottle back down on the counter and looked closer into the mirror at himself. I wondered if he was really looking at me. He looked like he was in such agony. \n\nThen I watched the whole life of the old man in reverse. I watched him backwards through his 50s drinking every night as the old man who no one in public would ever acknowledge. He spent each night alone, angry, drunk, in pain. He tore out patches of hair from his head in frustration while staring into mirrors screaming. He got beat up more than a few times, often picking a fight with those who were too happy for him to let go on their merry way. The man cashed unemployment checks and spent many nights on the streets sleeping on bus stops, beneath underpasses, and in makeshift tents. When he was housed, it was never for long. Evictions followed him under each new roof. He punched cement walls with bloodying knuckles. He would cut himself to make sure he could still feel.\n\nI watched him loose job he hated in his late 40s. Then I watched him go to work everyday and pretend he didn’t hate it. He didn’t celebrate any birthdays in his 50s, but as the forty wound backwards he started to make himself a cake each year. 44 was spent with a store-bought cake in an apartment too large for just him. 43 was the same. 42, the same again, except he spends the whole day in fits of tears. I was in a court house watching a man get sentenced to jail for the murder of two people, the result of a drunk driving accident. Then I was at a funeral. Two pictures sat at the top of two very different size caskets. The picture of a beautiful woman with blonde hair was propped up on the larger of the two, that of a girl who couldn’t be older than 5 on the smaller one. I was in the remains of a car crash. The pavement on all sides of me was covered in bits of shattered glass and mangled metal parts. The whole scene was in red and blue light. I jumped up and the flaming car in front of me quickly reversed the explosion that had occurred. I was in front of the back passenger seat slamming the car window with my bloody fists. I crawled back into the wreck of the car and sat back down behind the wheel of the crumpled car. The woman’s whose picture was on the casket sat in the passenger seat with blood gushing from he head and a chunk of jagged metal through her torso. I was driving home before the car was hit. We were all out to dinner at a restaurant called The Great Wall of China. The little girl was slurping lo mein and I was holding the hand of the blonde woman. \n\nI watched the old man fall in love with the woman’s whose name was Beth. I saw love blossom with maturity and respect. I felt a type of love that I had yet to experience in my own youthful stint at this game. The two fought but always made up. They loved each other before anything else in the whole world.  The last memory I was shown was of Beth walking into a class at UConn and sitting next to the old man. \n\nWhen I came back into my bedroom there were two presences there. It all started to click into place for me. This dark entity was not of our world, whether it was cold outside or a balmy summer day. It could only live here if it found a vessel attached to our mortal world of inexplicable sadness and pain. Suicide was probably the only way that a vessel as such would become available. And of that, a life of excruciating pain born from inexplicable chance would only sweeten the feast for such a despicable entity. It all came to me in an instant and I was sure I was right. There was another theory I couldn’t shake. The tragedy of a drunk driving accident didn’t seem like a coincident. I think the entity could *taste* different flavors of pain and suffering. And I think he liked the taste of this old man’s, so he sought for more of the same. I was furious. The anger of two wronged souls coursed through me.\n\nThe old man looked as he did in the last memory I saw of him at UConn. He looked at peace, and then he was gone. The other presence in my room was no more than the shadow of a being. It was dark with orange eyes. The shape of it looked like a human of incredible height, hunched over so its head hung around eye level to my own. The crest of its back touched the ceiling. I walked over to my front door and ripped it open. Then I looked the shadow, a mere wisp of the horror it was before. I starred straight into its glowing orange eyes that no longer terrified me. I stood with the door ajar, delivering the words I wanted to say with a fury I could not previously access,\n\n“Get the fuck out of *my* apartment!”",

        "text": " \n\nIf I had to describe Elina Remes in one word, that word would be a rose. Eye-catching, beautiful, and yet thorny. Very colorful and yet incredibly pure. I’ve known her for over two decades. When we first met, Elina was that one girl all the boys at school liked. Most ended up being weirded out by her artistic interests and unusual choice of pets. I on the other hand found her peculiarities charming. I guess that’s why we bonded and remained friends all those years later. Still, as people age, they tend to drift apart. The same happened to her and me. We’ve remained close nonetheless, regardless of time and distance.\n\nIt wasn’t much of a surprise when she called me, wanting to talk about nothing in particular. The odd thing was, however, the way she casually spoke about being separated. I remember the happiness written all over her face at her wedding. In fact, she always seems to be content with herself and her life. A woman with a positive heart and yet so dark a mind it would’ve driven anyone else to madness.\n\nThe thing about Elina is that her life was always decent; her parents are great, and she has got a great relationship with her siblings. She was never hungry or seriously ill. A dream-like existence. One that potentially enabled her to see things we, the less fortunate, not that my life is so terrible, couldn’t see. She could express and redefine darkness to even the most morbid individuals.\n\nAs we spoke over the phone, the topic of art naturally came up. Elina said she was about to launch her first exhibition in a few weeks and wondered if I was interested in getting a sneak peek at her works before they go public. Admittedly, I’ve always liked her paintings and getting to see a bunch of reptiles was just a sweet bonus. I agreed, and we’ve spent a weekend together since she lives quite a distance away.\n\nI ended up driving through a blizzard to see a bunch of depressive paintings, nearly killing myself through exposure just because I felt like having a few drinks and a chat with an old friend. Granted, said friend is probably the most intelligent person I know and is someone who understands me like no other on a spiritual level of sorts, but next time, I’ll have her over at my place…\n\nOnce I arrived at Elina’s, I instantly remembered how great it was to grow up in a distant village in the mountains. The silence, the cold yet real humanity, and the almost romantic atmosphere around everything. It was almost intoxicating.\n\nSpeaking of intoxicating, as it is customary for us, an offer of a drink followed a greeting from my dearest friend and that’s how we’ve spent nearly half a day. Drinking vodka and catching up before for a few hours before Elina’s art collage came to mind. I had almost entirely forgotten about it in an endless conversation about idiots at work, idiots in the wider world, and idiots as a whole. Honestly, for someone who had been through a recent separation, Elina seemed genuinely happy, with no signs of hurt or longing. Almost eerily so. And it’s not like she hid her emotions, either. We declared our love for each other a few times that day.\n\nEventually, after being already fairly intoxicated, Elina grabbed my hand and pulled me into her gallery room. Proudly unveiling painting after painting. Before long, a picturesque cacophony of artistic madness surrounded me. Paintings the likes of “Tears of Agony” which was a painting of a screaming face with tear marks carved into the skin surrounded by a rainbow of fiery colors in violent strokes mimicking flames or “Until Death and Beyond” which was a painting of a man kissing his dead lover as the latter lay lifeless, pale and emaciated from consumption were so emotive and true to life they had a sobering effect on me.\n\nAnother painting; “Oppression” had an incredibly realistic depiction of possessive oppression or the tight grip of madness on one’s mind. A pair of conjoined ghastly faces, sharing a cheek and obscuring each other’s mouths with equally deathly hands surrounded by pitched darkness. This one was really powerful; I could almost hear their muffled screams as I looked at it. I almost felt bad for them as I looked at these faces.\n\nThere were dozens of such paintings in that room, all different, each unique. A new flavor and shade of the mental hell this woman was spilling out of her brain somehow without ever having to pass through the gates of perdition.\n\nElina found it funny that I was so blown away by the majesty and purity of her works. The unbridled darkness in “A Northern Night Over the Gaping Jaws of Hel” and the insane detail of drawings on the robe of the courtesan in “Jigoku” were all just so captivating and beyond any logic. I knew she was talented, but I did not know she had gotten this fucking brilliant.\n\nAnd yet, there stood one covered canvas Elina seemed to avoid showing to me. I noticed she skipped that one a few times, but before I could ask her about it. She said, “I’ll be back in a moment” before leaving me alone with the visual madness that was peering straight into my mind.\n\nWhatever was under that cloth really intrigued me, regardless of if this was something unfinished or something that wasn’t up to her standard. I wanted, I needed, to see it. The hidden painting was almost calling out to me, begging for my eyes to experience it. I walked over to the covered canvas, thinking it wouldn’t be too big of a deal if I just took a peek at what was underneath and pulled the cloth away.\n\nMy heart skipped a bit when I saw what was underneath. I couldn’t believe my eyes. It couldn’t or shouldn’t have been real. Just couldn’t. My skin crawled, and a sudden breeze caressed my limbs as I stared into the eyes of that thing.\n\nPietaador Biisteerrson.\n\nA hundred-eyed, dog-headed, tattered-winged abomination with a serpentine lower half. A demonic presence that no one should’ve ever known about. I have told no one about this thing since my mother decades ago. This creature used to haunt me at night. It would just stand over me and drool hungrily as I cowered away under my sheets, trying to fall asleep.\n\nThe terrible snorts that accompanied its putrid breath once again came to mind, as I could not turn my gaze away from the illustration of the chimera. Torn between confusion and a growing dread, I continued to stare at the creature trapped on the canvas. As if attempting to face my greatest fear once and for all.\n\nThe sound of violent coughing forced me to pull my gaze away from the devil in the painting. Hyperalert and practically wheezing, I left the gallery room, calling out Elina’s name. She wouldn’t answer, but the coughing got worse and louder. Almost to the point of vomiting. I could hear audible pained gasps for air between the fits of a cough. I looked around for Elina, but I couldn’t find her. The house seemed to grow bigger and become labyrinthine in my panic.\n\n“Ella, are you alright?”\n\n“Hey, Ella, is everything okay?”\n\nI kept screaming as the sound of her coughing assaulted my eardrums. Finally, I found her crouching on the floor next to a bed. I stood over her, placing my hands on her shoulders as something escaped her mouth.\n\n“What’s wrong, El..?” I didn’t even finish the sentence. She turned to face me. Her gray eyes were bloodshot and pleading, blood pouring out of her mouth. The color was fading from her skin as she bent herself once more in a coughing fit. Her throat was making all sorts of disgusting sounds between pained moans escaping her mouth and reflexive attempts to expel whatever was stuck inside of her.\n\nThe sight of her in this state threw me into a state of panic-induced dizziness, interwoven with fear. I could feel my heartbeat in about every organ and the room was spinning at irregular angles. The combination of alcohol in my system and the sensory overload weren’t doing me any favors. I was getting sick myself and totally lost. Elina grabbed onto my shirt and collapsed on top of me, her head facing downward. I heard something make its way up her throat. That sickening sound, God…\n\nA current of blood came flooding through her lips as I hopelessly watched until she fell on the floor. Completely still. I just stood there, frozen, unable, and unwilling to move. Feeling as if I am experiencing an out-of-body experience.\n\nI thought she was dead; I thought I was dying or was already dead. Maybe there was something in the alcohol. Or something in some of the paint she used. I didn’t want to die. I felt like screaming and crying, but I couldn’t utter a sound. My body wasn’t my own during these moments. My mind was eating itself alive, trying to keep me afloat in all of that madness, but nothing could prepare me for the sight of Elina’s body jolting violently and flipping face upward. She shook violently, grasping at her chest and throat before a thundering crack out of her mouth, echoing like gunfire in my ears.\n\nA dog’s snout came out.\n\nFollowed by a massive black mass of muscle and fur and snakes and skin all pulling themselves up from within her mouth with a wet noise violating the room.\n\nIt all happened so fast, almost like a movie reel. It was too fucking insane to be true and yet there I was, face to face once again, with that animal that drooled over my form when I was a child. Crawling out of the body of my friend.\n\nIt let out a terrible roar that turned into a shriek and eventually into a whistle. I just closed my eyes and prayed for everything to stop. My prayers came true when a wave of burning liquid iron covered everything from my head to my chest. An ocean of searing pain. It was so bad I couldn’t even scream.\n\nAfter that, came darkness. Pure nothingness. The sweet release of death whose joy-bringing embrace I felt but for a moment and then I was gone.\n\nEventually, I woke up, wrapped up in blankets in a very warm room. Looking around, it felt very cozy. I thought I was in heaven. Especially after seeing Elina’s angelic face smiling at me.\n\n“Wha… what happened?” I let out.\n\n“You went outside underdressed and passed out…” she said before smacking me across the face. “Idiot, don’t scare me like that!” She scolded, trying to sound stern, but her voice sounded caring and sweet.\n\nMy thoughts were still swimming in the mush that was in my brain. My entire body was sore and my head pounding.\n\n“I left you for a second to answer the phone, and you end up half-dead.” Elina complained, “Damn you men!”\n\n“A s-s-second?” I slurred.\n\n“Well, yeah, maybe more than a second… “\n\n“What… about… the… creature… and… you… and… blood…” I questioned, struggling with my verbiage.\n\nShe sighed, “You looked at the Bies-infested canvas, love.”\n\nI looked at her, perplexed. She must’ve noticed the change in my expression.\n\n“You won’t believe me now, but this thing is how I get inspiration. It shows the viewer terrible things. Had it in the family forever. We’re immune to its effects. I don’t know why. We see the visions, but everyone in my family knows it’s all not real. It doesn’t freak us out. I look at it every now and again and use the visions as inspiration for my paintings,” she explained.\n\n“Aha…” I wasn’t sure if to believe her. A demon-infested painting canvas sounds kind of impossible, but a lot of things around this woman are impossible. I can’t stress enough just how good these paintings are at being macabre in the rawest sense.\n\nShe figured she didn’t convince me just yet, so she got up to her feet and walked out of the room saying, “let me show you something.”\n\nI wasn’t really able to think straight, so none of anything made sense to me at that moment. Elina came back a few moments later holding a piece of paper she handed to me. Her husband’s death certificate.\n\nCause of death; suicide. The poor bastard shoved scissors into his eyes and ended up killing himself that way.\n\nElina’s voice turned solemn. “I told him not to look at it, but he did when I wasn't home to stop him, after years of me warning him against it. I don’t know what the canvas showed him, but he couldn’t handle it.”\n\n“Oh” was the only thing that escaped my mouth in response. I was in pure disbelief and potentially considering the truthfulness of her words. After all, why would she lie to me?\n\nIn typical Elina fashion, she lightened up the mood, saying, “I never told you why I am single. I just told you I am” before snatching the death certificate away.\n\n“I’m just glad you’re still alive...” she muttered, walking out of the room.",

        "text": "When I moved into my unit, I never thought that living on the ground level was going to carry any significance at all. I didn’t even think the fact that my windows were at a reachable height for any average size person, nor the front door opening directly outside from my tiny kitchen, was something to be alarmed about. Outside my door was a short driveway where I typically parked my car, with the rear end of the car just barely missing the threshold between driveway and sidewalk. The mere fifteen feet between my bed and the bustling foot traffic of Main Street was of no issue, that was more than enough space for me to foolishly think I was sheltered from the outside world. It was my first apartment all my own, finally I had a space that I was entitled to make decisions about. I had the big details like color scheme and furniture already planned out, with the accoutrement to be figured out as part of the journey. \n\nWhen I first told my mother I was moving into my own apartment, the first thing she said was, “What happens if you choke and there’s no one around to give you the Heimlich?”\n\nThat was my worst fear for a while. The only part of the apartment I was not thrilled about was a small window on the top section of my front door. The door opened directly into my kitchen, meaning that if I was in my kitchen at the stove I was forced into view of the street directly outside. The window had no blinds or space for me to add them. It made me feel like I was on the display for the whole neighborhood. “*Welcome to bachelor pad cooking with your host Oscar Walowitz!*” The whole thing felt ridiculous. But it was still my first apartment, so in a small way I loved this quirky window that made me feel so exposed and vulnerable.\n\nThe only reason that I could finally afford my own bachelor pad was because I had just started a new job at XPollen Software. I had worked for the last four years hopping from startup to startup doing what I could to move through the ranks of the Software Engineering departments all leading up to this latest Senior Software Engineering gig at XPollen. XPollen would be the most money I had ever seen in a bi-weekly check, and it was the largest company I had worked for so far having quadrupled to 160+ people in the last two years alone. They were going to allow me to work on the most complex projects I might ever get to work on. It couldn’t have been more of a dream come true. Though I did have some slight reservations about the ethics of what the software would be used for. \n\nIt took me nearly the whole first month, but I eventually got the place to a state that I was happy with, the apartment finally felt like home. It felt like it was a small extension of myself. The walls were close to bare, but what was there was only mine. I had collected one large, framed painting of an old ship boat captain, three paintings of guitars, and a hand knit quilt that read “Welcome to the Waloworld” that my grandmother had given to me as a child. These were the only pieces I had, each acted as a bookmark for a moment in my life. I bought a toaster, a blender, 10 colorful plates, 3 secondhand mugs with funny messages on them like “Jesus was American” with a classic Jesus likeness holding a tiny T-Rex, 6 forks, 6 knives, 6 spoons, 2 spatulas, 1 whisk, and a handful of other items that were now dear to me. All these creature comforts made a home when I never thought I would find one again.\n\nIt was the first weekend of October when I first saw him. I was making myself some scrambled eggs when I first saw something outside threw that odd front door window. There were multiple irregularities in view. I had dropped off my Nissan at the shop that previous day, so the space in the driveway that was normally blocked by it was no longer obstructed, giving me a clear, full view of the sidewalk outside. At first all I saw was his back, and then I began to see more each and every time I looked out the window. I was almost positive it was a man I was seeing. He was old and the back of his head was missing patches of hair, the rest was covered in black, grey and white curls. At first, I thought the man was short, until I noticed that he was hunched over, looking downwards. From the back I could not see much but based on his arm positions it looked like he was peering down on something in his hands. There was a sickly look about him. It was as if he had just been pulled from some hell I didn’t want to imagine. Many of the homeless around looked like that. He just stood still amid the passing cars and buses in the street, the busy people moving somewhere in both directions. None of them seemed to notice the man, it was as if he was a piece of hardened gum on the sidewalk to be avoided. So, I finished my breakfast and pushed the image of the man from my mind. \n\nA whole week went by without anything significant going on outside my windows. I worked at my desk for the first two days of the work week, from the desk I could see outside my bedroom window to another section of the sidewalk on Main Street.  I saw people walking with sweatshirts on their backs and coffees in their hands. I saw old women walking the streets of the city with no place to be. There were children taking themselves to school as some city children did. But no old men with horrible posture and missing patches of hair were present. I worked in our clean and sleek downtown office on Wednesday, and then back home for the next two days. It was almost exactly one week later when I saw him the second time.\n\nI had told my friends I would meet them out on that Saturday night. Some place downtown I couldn’t remember now, some place where the music was too loud to talk and the drinks were dizzyingly overpriced. It didn’t matter because I was not fully present when I was there. I couldn’t stop thinking about what I had just saw. The second time I saw the man was in the same exact spot and position I saw him the first time. This time it was dark, night had fully set in, and the only light to see him came indirectly from a streetlamp. I froze in my kitchen, the man’s form was unchanged, but at that nightly hour there were fewer people moving about. Some of the automobiles passing tossed their headlamps along his ragged clothes. The worst part still was that as I stood them frozen, I watched my uber pull up right in front of him. I steadied myself by closing my eyes and breathing deeply, “*nothing is scary, its just a man, be a man.* *He’s probably homeless, best to just ignore and keep moving”* I told myself. When I opened my door, the man was gone. I was so taken aback I stood there in my open door feeling the Autumn wind pass into the kitchen. Then the uber honked its obnoxious wail and I snapped out of whatever haze I had been in. \n\nI didn’t see the man for some time after that, but that didn’t mean he left me alone. I thought I saw the man countless times over that next month. I saw him lurking behind a dumpster in an alley I was passing. The man’s form would appear in bathrooms as I would enter, or when I looked up in the mirror from washing my hands. The most often false occurrence was when I would see him standing there, hunched over across the street from me as I was walking to the grocery store, to the pharmacy, or literally anywhere I was harmlessly passing to without care of where each step landed. November came in and so did the cold. The winters in the Northeast could be brutal, but this one wasn’t just yet, most days topped out in the fifties and gently slipped into the thirties at night. It was the first day that it dropped below freezing when the man visited me again.\n\nI was lying in my bed desperate for some sleep after a long day of nearly 12 hours in code. After days like that, sleep never came easily. It was as if my brain needed extra time to ramp down, like an engine with hundreds of miles behind it. I could feel my body passing into a sleep state, when I was suddenly ripped from sleep’s soft embrace. Two loud slams on my front door screamed into my ears. I bolted upright in bed and felt my body go cold. I immediately started sweating and I could feel knots forming in my gut. *Thud! Thud!* Then it all went silent. Not even the bed made a sound as I pushed myself to the edge of it. Either that or I was unable to hear anything but my own interwoven thoughts of terror and dread. The alarm clock read 3:33AM. It couldn’t be! I must have been fast asleep for hour now, only to be woken up by the fists pounding at my door. Before the threshold I paused, steadying myself for what I might see through the glass. I was fully aware that this door of mere inches in thickness was the only thing standing between me and the street. Down the driveway where my Nissan was lying idle, out before the empty road beyond, was the same silhouette of the old man. He was in the same slouching position from our previous two meetings. Then I blinked and he was gone. It took me close to an hour to convince myself it had all been a dream, that being the only way my restless mind would allow my body to sleep.\n\nMy alarm clock rang out the next morning, ending a night of wretched sleep. My work started to falter as I become more and more conscious of this old man’s presence. I couldn’t get him out of my head. I could no longer tap into that special place I used my whole career to see the flow of terabytes of data without the stream of endless code giving way to that patchy head of gray and black curly hair. His ragged clothes and dirty shoes. But most of all, I had the painful curiosity of what the man might look like if he ever turned around to face me. I wouldn’t get that chance for some time, but I imagined every possible horror in the time that lead up to that day.\n\nThe day’s got colder and the old man took less time to visit me the next time. It was again at night, that following week 3 days after the night that left me ragged. Again, *Thud! Thud!* And then a third, louder *Whack!* The door shook on its hinges, and I could feel the vibration throughout the whole apartment. I wondered if this level of commotion might carry to one of the other units. The clock read 3:17AM. This *entity*, or whatever it was, because I was convinced this was no longer a man, I was not going to let it own me, not going to let it continue to encroach on my life as an uninvited guest. I steadied my resolve and jumped out of bed. This was it! I was going to confront whatever it was and make it known that I was Oscar Walowitzs and I was not to be pushed around by some sprit! \n\nI stomped over to the front door and looked out, but there was no silhouette of an old man standing at the end of my driveway. I opened the door and took a step across the threshold onto my welcome matt. “Leave me alone!” I yelled to the empty street like a man gone mad. I saw nothing, I heard nothing. Silence had come again. Then my eyes began to pick up the slightest movement on the roof of the house across the street, something was moving slightly yet rapidly. I hung there in the silent, intense moments between seeing and perceiving. Then I realized the form on the roof had glowing orange eyes, my mind had mistaken them for the light of a streetlamp from the angle I was standing at. I could tell it was the form of the man starring down at me breathing quick, frantic, manic breaths. The man was practically gyrating, and his glowing eyes starred down at me. I could just make out that he was hunched over on the roof, starring down at me, I could see that he was holding something, but it was too dark to see. \n\nThen he an eardrum shattering screech erupted from the man, *EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEYYYYYYYYYYYYYOOOOOOOOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!* \n\nI covered my mortal ears, yet it did nothing to down the sound of this other worldly creature. *OSCAR!* The man screamed, at this point I was writhing on the ground with my welcome mat scratching against my bare arms. I was too terrified to feel the below freezing temperatures around me. *GIVE ME YOUR PAIN, I WANT TO HELP YOU OSCAR.* It felt like he was screaming into my head. “LEAVE ME ALONE!” I yelled as loud I could, trying to shout above the screaming in my head that were louder than a jet engine.\n\nThen it was over. The screaming was gone, and I was lying on my doorstep staring up at a night sky muddled by light pollution. I rolled over to look at the roof of the house that the entity had been perched on. It was just a roof. My body hurt everywhere, and I was just starting to feel the cold against my body that was only shielded by boxer briefs and a T shirt. I got to my feet and heard something else. It was the sound of a window opening, then a voice “Hey buddy!” I looked up and a man was standing in the window on the second floor of the condominium building next door. “Yeah?” I responded. “Shut the fuck up!” He yelled down, and then slammed his window closed.\n\nI went that next day into XPollen HQ for a change of scenery. Another minute at home and I would have been sick. I had never felt more trapped in my life, it was if the walls of my studio apartment were shrinking inward by the day. Once the walls had secured me in place, not allowing me to move, I imagined the entity of that old man would come and slice me open from groin to throat. He would feed on me and move to the next poor schmuck. Or was there’s something about me in particular he found so appealing? He said he wanted “*MY PAIN*” he said he wanted “*TO HELP*” me. But why? And how? I did not feel like I was in pain, well besides the general ache of poor sleep, but that wasn’t really pain.  I couldn’t stomach office small talk. How could anyone talk about the weather, our new business unit announced by corporate, Janice’s new veneers, or the price of gas when there was something other worldly haunting you? All these people with their novelty coffee cups stewing gossip that made their lives a modicum more interesting than facing their individual truths. Tech evangelists spouting jargon with no semblance of understanding of anything below the shiny surface level of their vapid world. The shine of the “tech” world was losing it shine before my eyes. I was having an existential crisis right in that new multi-million-dollar office building. I had to leave, I feared going home, but I couldn’t be there any longer.\n\nI spent the rest of the afternoon at home between fits of rage, despair, productivity, and more despair. The thought, “why is this happening to me?” crossed my mind close to 1000 times. I didn’t look back on my life thinking I had been a bad person deserving of any of this. I had been a just person, I held the door for people after I had walked through, I volunteered for a couple hours each year, I ran a 5k once for charity, why in god’s name was this happening to *ME*!? And that’s when it hit me, what is this really was something in god’s name? Or in the name of some other god, maybe the devil? Maybe it was a pagan god or one of those Olympian one’s from antiquity. I decided to pray before bed to see if there was anything, any deity of any sort that would help me. I got on my knees and crossed my hand in front of me on the bed, lowering my head to meet them. “Please God, if you’re out there, if you really are listening and watching me right now. Please help me. I’m a good person I held the door for people after I had walked through, I volunteered for a couple hours each year, I ran a 5k once for charity and stuff.  I don’t know what this thing is, but I need it gone. It’s ruining my life. Can you do that for me please God?” Then I got up, crawled under the covers, and went to bed. \n\nThat evening was not the restful one I had hoped for. Another *Thud* at the door clutched me away from my slumber. My body was sick from exhaustion and in a way, it was calming given the circumstances. I was at the point of being tired when my whole body and soul responded to any stimuli with “fuck it.” I went to the door, again there was nothing at the end of my driveway. I opened the door and peered over the neighbor’s roof across the street. A blistering sub-freezing breeze howled past me. There was nothing, I checked the other rooves, all lay silent and still as shingles. “You’re just going to slam on my door and run! Fuck you spirit! Fuck you, old man!” I screamed into the frigid wind. I walked back through my front door and locked it. Immediately I felt a cold rush shoot up my spine; it was the feeling of being watched, or when you stare into the dark recesses of the woods, or not being alone in a room you previously thought you were. I slowly turned from my front door to my bedroom. The form of an old man with his back to me, hunched over, wild patches of hair missing from his head, was standing in the corner of my bedroom. I could feel my stomach drop, my spit frozen in my throat. The man began to slowly turn, he could not have turned any slower, yet I was unable to move at all. *I TOLD YOU.* The voice was less of a scream now, there was a rasp to it that was lost when at full volume. *I WANT YOU PAIN.* \n\nThe man as now perpendicular to me, the orange glow from his too wide eyes reflected off the wall in front of him. Now that he was closer to me than ever before I could see new features to him than before. There was blood on his hands, on the front of his shirt, and there was even splatter along the one cheek of his face that I could see. *I WANT TO FEEL WHAT YOU FELT I WANT TO DRINK YOUR PAIN INTO ME!* The voice was getting louder now; the man was still turning ever so slightly. The man began to scream again as he did the previous night just as he was taking the last miniscule shuffling steps to face me head on. The blood was only on his left cheek, but it was all around his mouth. The front of his shirt was covered like it had pooled out from his face. *GIVE ME WHAT I WANT OR I WILL MAKE YOU FEEL MORE PAIN MORE DELICIOUS PAIN THAN ANYONE ONE MORTAL CAN CONTINUE TO LIVE WITH!* He was walking towards me now. All my body would allow me to do was face him and stand mouth agape in adjunct terror.  This was a terror I had never felt in my entire life. There are no words that can describe it to an outsider.  *THE MORE PAIN YOU HAVE THE MORE I WILL CRAVE YOU THE MORE I WILL SEEK YOU OUT.* He was now just a few feet in front of me, hunched over but looking at me face to face. It was as if he had grown taller but had not stood up any straighter. His mouth formed a terrible grin; crooked teeth decorated a mouth too curved to be human, beginning to open too wide to be possible. I could feel the urine start to trickle down my leg, powerless to what was happening. *GIVE IT TO ME!* With my courage fading to oblivion, I pulled from somewhere inside of me everything I had left to give into this one act.\n\n“YOU ARE NOT WELCOME HERE!”\n\nA scream louder than anything I had heard previously erupted from the beast. I felt the horrid stinking breath from its disgusting maw blow my hair back from my head. I was forced to close my eyes to shield myself from it. Then with a strength I did not know I had, I pulls my hand into a fist and swung it forward! \n\nMy fist only connected with air and I fell to the ground from the momentum, twisting to the floor. I lay there on my back, again, soaked now in my own piss. But I was alive. I showered with tears streaming down my face, then crawled into bed still soaking wet and fell asleep.",

The most often false occurrence was when I would see him standing there, hunched over across the street from me as I was walking to the grocery store, to the pharmacy, or literally anywhere I was harmlessly passing to without care of where each step landed. November came in and so did the cold. The winters in the Northeast could be brutal, but this one wasn’t just yet, most days topped out in the fifties and gently slipped into the thirties at night. It was the first day that it dropped below freezing when the man visited me again.\n\nI was lying in my bed desperate for some sleep after a long day of nearly 12 hours in code. After days like that, sleep never came easily. It was as if my brain needed extra time to ramp down, like an engine with hundreds of miles behind it. I could feel my body passing into a sleep state, when I was suddenly ripped from sleep’s soft embrace. Two loud slams on my front door screamed into my ears. I bolted upright in bed and felt my body go cold. I immediately started sweating and I could feel knots forming in my gut. *Thud! Thud!* Then it all went silent. Not even the bed made a sound as I pushed myself to the edge of it. Either that or I was unable to hear anything but my own interwoven thoughts of terror and dread. The alarm clock read 3:33AM. It couldn’t be! I must have been fast asleep for hour now, only to be woken up by the fists pounding at my door. Before the threshold I paused, steadying myself for what I might see through the glass. I was fully aware that this door of mere inches in thickness was the only thing standing between me and the street. Down the driveway where my Nissan was lying idle, out before the empty road beyond, was the same silhouette of the old man. He was in the same slouching position from our previous two meetings. Then I blinked and he was gone. It took me close to an hour to convince myself it had all been a dream, that being the only way my restless mind would allow my body to sleep.\n\nMy alarm clock rang out the next morning, ending a night of wretched sleep. My work started to falter as I become more and more conscious of this old man’s presence. I couldn’t get him out of my head. I could no longer tap into that special place I used my whole career to see the flow of terabytes of data without the stream of endless code giving way to that patchy head of gray and black curly hair. His ragged clothes and dirty shoes. But most of all, I had the painful curiosity of what the man might look like if he ever turned around to face me. I wouldn’t get that chance for some time, but I imagined every possible horror in the time that lead up to that day.\n\nThe day’s got colder and the old man took less time to visit me the next time. It was again at night, that following week 3 days after the night that left me ragged. Again, *Thud! Thud!* And then a third, louder *Whack!* The door shook on its hinges, and I could feel the vibration throughout the whole apartment. I wondered if this level of commotion might carry to one of the other units. The clock read 3:17AM. This *entity*, or whatever it was, because I was convinced this was no longer a man, I was not going to let it own me, not going to let it continue to encroach on my life as an uninvited guest. I steadied my resolve and jumped out of bed. This was it! I was going to confront whatever it was and make it known that I was Oscar Walowitzs and I was not to be pushed around by some sprit! \n\nI stomped over to the front door and looked out, but there was no silhouette of an old man standing at the end of my driveway. I opened the door and took a step across the threshold onto my welcome matt. “Leave me alone!” I yelled to the empty street like a man gone mad. I saw nothing, I heard nothing. Silence had come again. Then my eyes began to pick up the slightest movement on the roof of the house across the street, something was moving slightly yet rapidly. I hung there in the silent, intense moments between seeing and perceiving. Then I realized the form on the roof had glowing orange eyes, my mind had mistaken them for the light of a streetlamp from the angle I was standing at. I could tell it was the form of the man starring down at me breathing quick, frantic, manic breaths. The man was practically gyrating, and his glowing eyes starred down at me. I could just make out that he was hunched over on the roof, starring down at me, I could see that he was holding something, but it was too dark to see. \n\nThen he an eardrum shattering screech erupted from the man, *EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEYYYYYYYYYYYYYOOOOOOOOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!* \n\nI covered my mortal ears, yet it did nothing to down the sound of this other worldly creature. *OSCAR!* The man screamed, at this point I was writhing on the ground with my welcome mat scratching against my bare arms. I was too terrified to feel the below freezing temperatures around me. *GIVE ME YOUR PAIN, I WANT TO HELP YOU OSCAR.* It felt like he was screaming into my head. “LEAVE ME ALONE!” I yelled as loud I could, trying to shout above the screaming in my head that were louder than a jet engine.\n\nThen it was over. The screaming was gone, and I was lying on my doorstep staring up at a night sky muddled by light pollution. I rolled over to look at the roof of the house that the entity had been perched on. It was just a roof. My body hurt everywhere, and I was just starting to feel the cold against my body that was only shielded by boxer briefs and a T shirt. I got to my feet and heard something else. It was the sound of a window opening, then a voice “Hey buddy!” I looked up and a man was standing in the window on the second floor of the condominium building next door. “Yeah?” I responded. “Shut the fuck up!” He yelled down, and then slammed his window closed.\n\nI went that next day into XPollen HQ for a change of scenery. Another minute at home and I would have been sick. I had never felt more trapped in my life, it was if the walls of my studio apartment were shrinking inward by the day. Once the walls had secured me in place, not allowing me to move, I imagined the entity of that old man would come and slice me open from groin to throat. He would feed on me and move to the next poor schmuck. Or was there’s something about me in particular he found so appealing? He said he wanted “*MY PAIN*” he said he wanted “*TO HELP*” me. But why? And how? I did not feel like I was in pain, well besides the general ache of poor sleep, but that wasn’t really pain.  I couldn’t stomach office small talk. How could anyone talk about the weather, our new business unit announced by corporate, Janice’s new veneers, or the price of gas when there was something other worldly haunting you? All these people with their novelty coffee cups stewing gossip that made their lives a modicum more interesting than facing their individual truths. Tech evangelists spouting jargon with no semblance of understanding of anything below the shiny surface level of their vapid world. The shine of the “tech” world was losing it shine before my eyes. I was having an existential crisis right in that new multi-million-dollar office building. I had to leave, I feared going home, but I couldn’t be there any longer.\n\nI spent the rest of the afternoon at home between fits of rage, despair, productivity, and more despair. The thought, “why is this happening to me?” crossed my mind close to 1000 times. I didn’t look back on my life thinking I had been a bad person deserving of any of this. I had been a just person, I held the door for people after I had walked through, I volunteered for a couple hours each year, I ran a 5k once for charity, why in god’s name was this happening to *ME*!? And that’s when it hit me, what is this really was something in god’s name? Or in the name of some other god, maybe the devil? Maybe it was a pagan god or one of those Olympian one’s from antiquity. I decided to pray before bed to see if there was anything, any deity of any sort that would help me. I got on my knees and crossed my hand in front of me on the bed, lowering my head to meet them. “Please God, if you’re out there, if you really are listening and watching me right now. Please help me. I’m a good person I held the door for people after I had walked through, I volunteered for a couple hours each year, I ran a 5k once for charity and stuff.  I don’t know what this thing is, but I need it gone. It’s ruining my life. Can you do that for me please God?” Then I got up, crawled under the covers, and went to bed. \n\nThat evening was not the restful one I had hoped for. Another *Thud* at the door clutched me away from my slumber. My body was sick from exhaustion and in a way, it was calming given the circumstances. I was at the point of being tired when my whole body and soul responded to any stimuli with “fuck it.” I went to the door, again there was nothing at the end of my driveway. I opened the door and peered over the neighbor’s roof across the street. A blistering sub-freezing breeze howled past me. There was nothing, I checked the other rooves, all lay silent and still as shingles. “You’re just going to slam on my door and run! Fuck you spirit! Fuck you, old man!” I screamed into the frigid wind. I walked back through my front door and locked it. Immediately I felt a cold rush shoot up my spine; it was the feeling of being watched, or when you stare into the dark recesses of the woods, or not being alone in a room you previously thought you were. I slowly turned from my front door to my bedroom. The form of an old man with his back to me, hunched over, wild patches of hair missing from his head, was standing in the corner of my bedroom. I could feel my stomach drop, my spit frozen in my throat. The man began to slowly turn, he could not have turned any slower, yet I was unable to move at all. *I TOLD YOU.* The voice was less of a scream now, there was a rasp to it that was lost when at full volume. *I WANT YOU PAIN.* \n\nThe man as now perpendicular to me, the orange glow from his too wide eyes reflected off the wall in front of him. Now that he was closer to me than ever before I could see new features to him than before. There was blood on his hands, on the front of his shirt, and there was even splatter along the one cheek of his face that I could see. *I WANT TO FEEL WHAT YOU FELT I WANT TO DRINK YOUR PAIN INTO ME!* The voice was getting louder now; the man was still turning ever so slightly. The man began to scream again as he did the previous night just as he was taking the last miniscule shuffling steps to face me head on. The blood was only on his left cheek, but it was all around his mouth. The front of his shirt was covered like it had pooled out from his face. *GIVE ME WHAT I WANT OR I WILL MAKE YOU FEEL MORE PAIN MORE DELICIOUS PAIN THAN ANYONE ONE MORTAL CAN CONTINUE TO LIVE WITH!* He was walking towards me now. All my body would allow me to do was face him and stand mouth agape in adjunct terror.  This was a terror I had never felt in my entire life. There are no words that can describe it to an outsider.  *THE MORE PAIN YOU HAVE THE MORE I WILL CRAVE YOU THE MORE I WILL SEEK YOU OUT.* He was now just a few feet in front of me, hunched over but looking at me face to face. It was as if he had grown taller but had not stood up any straighter. His mouth formed a terrible grin; crooked teeth decorated a mouth too curved to be human, beginning to open too wide to be possible. I could feel the urine start to trickle down my leg, powerless to what was happening. *GIVE IT TO ME!* With my courage fading to oblivion, I pulled from somewhere inside of me everything I had left to give into this one act.\n\n“YOU ARE NOT WELCOME HERE!”\n\nA scream louder than anything I had heard previously erupted from the beast. I felt the horrid stinking breath from its disgusting maw blow my hair back from my head. I was forced to close my eyes to shield myself from it. Then with a strength I did not know I had, I pulls my hand into a fist and swung it forward! \n\nMy fist only connected with air and I fell to the ground from the momentum, twisting to the floor. I lay there on my back, again, soaked now in my own piss. But I was alive. I showered with tears streaming down my face, then crawled into bed still soaking wet and fell asleep.",

        "text": "Hello, all. Somewhere between the end of my last shift and me waking up this morning, I found the moxie to post on here about the things that have been going on at my job. No, there is no bad experience that I am hiding for the end. Those experiences will be their own separate posts. All I want is for some rational answers to why on earth any of this is possible.\n\nSome backstory, I'm a 27 year old who just got out of a deprecating divorce and was in need of a job if I wanted to ever have a sustainable living space for not only me, but for my child who I have shared custody with. When I had gotten married, me and my husband, who we will call Darren, failed to sign a prenup which meant I was able to dip into some of his money if I really needed to. At some point, I found myself reliant on him after getting laid off from my old job. I don't remember if it was for the company filing bankruptcy or them doing that annoying worker liquidation thing but either way, I had no way to get money which meant I was back on my own to look for a job. So when he told me he wanted to file for divorce, I suddenly felt my world crumbling down. I had yet to find a job thanks to my town's ever-growing population and I have very little saved.\n\nI won’t say that 1,439 dollars isn’t a lot, because compared to others I know I had no right to be ungrateful, however to pay for all the things I would need to survive put that all to shame. I was broke, living with someone who I depended on who didn’t love me any longer. Someone who hadn’t loved me for a long time. But, not being an asshole, I respected his wishes and we both filed for divorce. When we had, we mostly fought over the custody of our son, Rowan, and we landed on split, 50/50 custody. The only other thing that came of it was I was left with my own car and a small, three bedroom house in a nearby town in New Jersey. Thank fucking god. I think I would simply die if I wasn’t left with somewhere to live, even if it was just my car.\n\nWhen I had officially moved out of our shared house, I knew that the first moment of \"peace\" I got would be spent looking for a job and doing everything it took before I found one that that could keep me afloat for the time being while I find a permanent job that could skyrocket me back onto my feet. About a week into my new life, I was scrolling through the local newsletter for my town and found out that a diner not too far from where I was living was hiring. Perfect. Initially, I was sketched out thanks to a lot of factors. One being that, for as long as I’ve been coming to this town, I have never once heard of the diner. The name was Berryspout Diner, an interesting name all on its own, and seemed both abandoned yet brand new. I don’t really know how helpful that description alone is, so I’ll try to describe it and better detail. The walls are all covered in muck and overgrown leaves with rust coated hinges and windows smashed all to hell.\n\nOh and we can’t forget the colorful graffiti depicting horrible things like police brutality and gun violence with naked women to tie it all up. It was lewd and powerful all at the same time. When I describe it as being new, I mean that it seems like it was just placed there, contradicting my description above. Had I just been blind? Was this building always here? But in spite of those worries, I went onto the website listed in the blurb and sent in my application. It was mostly normal, me briefly explaining why I want the job and my gratitude for if I am even considered for the position. After long, restless months of waiting for the divorce to finalize, moving away from what I thought would be a permanent home, and now looking for a job, I could relax my muscles just a little and hope that I wouldn’t be left to my own devices again.\n\nIt was a couple weeks before I heard from the diner which left me begging for some money from my parents who I have been mostly financially independent from since I was 16. Thankfully they felt pitiful enough to give me enough to pay for groceries and some bills I had yet to pay. When I checked the mail one morning and saw an envelope from the place, I felt a surge of joy go through my body. I was finally able to get my life back together. Faster than I would like to admit, I swiftly opened up the letter and read through the whole thing like an ecstatic 12 year old opening tickets to their first concert on Christmas day. As if my luck got turned around, the diner accepted my application and I set a date on my calendar for the upcoming Thursday, the day I go in for my first time and learn the ropes of the place.\n\nSkipping some self loathing and hours of crying, Thursday came faster than I expected. One moment I found myself sitting on my couch, scrolling through the dry and boring stories about my neighbor's cat being saved from the roof of the coffee shop, the next I was standing in front of the building I have yet to see. The letters that were hung up, spelling ‘Berryspout Diner’ were barely hanging on by the hinges and I noticed that the window on the door was similarly smashed to the windows surrounding the walls of the diner. It was as run down as you can get, really. Regardless, I made my way inside and my world flipped on its head.\n\nWalking inside, everything that was not visible when I was outside suddenly filled my sight. The typical bright fluorescent lights lit up the room, illuminating the rows of booths and tables filled with patrons with waiters and waitresses periodically leaving the kitchen then to either give customers their food or napkins or just to ask questions. In front, there was a smiling hostess who looked up from whatever she was looking at and meeting my gaze. “Hello! What can I get you?” She asked, motioning me over as she assumed I was a customer. “Hey, I’m supposed to be getting a tour of the place. Today is my first day on the job.” I explained, noticing how her face shifted from the fabricated, worker cheer to the much more normal, neutral expression. “You’re Jillian, right? Follow me.” The lady, who I assumed was named Megan thanks to her name tag, made her way to the back end of the restaurant with me not so far behind. When we were walking past the countless adults and children, I noticed the almost translucent look to their skin and the sunken-in cheeks that made them look both dead and alive simultaneously.\n\nIt made my mind wander back to how on the outside looking in, the restaurant was deserted yet when you step through the doors you’re met with a whole new world. I got the idea to look back to the windows, but before I could, a gruffly male voice obstructed my hearing. “Hello there little lady, I’m Hank.” An older looking man said, holding his hand out for me to shake. After a couple moments of hesitation, I took his hand in mine and ended the handshake as quickly as it started. “Before we start with the tour, you need to change into our signature uniform!” Hank began, a smile taking over the previous frown that must’ve been imprinted on his face naturally. The uniforms were what you would expect. A black shirt and black pants or skirt duo (with the addition of leggings and/or long-sleeved shirts) with the logo of the diner printed on the front while the apron we had to wear was this maroon-ish berry color to go with the Berry part of Berryspout.\n\nOnce I finished putting on my work attire, I left the employee locker room (which was fairly large considering I only saw about 5 workers in total) and met back up with Megan and Hank who had just finished a conversation with a patron. “You ready for the adventure? Hank is known for being over the top with his descriptions.” Megan humored, flashing me a quick smile before waving goodbye and heading towards the front where a small line of people (if you could even call them that on the account of their translucent skin and visibly dead looking face) waiting to get served.\n\n\"Right off the bat, you should get to know the table numbers and their locations.\" Hank started off, walking over to the podium at the front where a tablet was. Grabbing it, the man excused himself as an apology for interrupting the work of the brunette I have come in acquaintance with before tapping the screen to avoid the tablet from shutting off. \"There are 20 seating options in total in 2 sections. On the right side of the restaurant are the tables to accommodate the larger parties that come in. You'd be surprised on how many death dates are celebrated here.\" Hank laughed, seemingly ignoring the confused expression on my face. \"Death dates?\" \"Don't keep your mind trained on that yet, sugar.\" Despite the skepticism and curiosity coating the walls of my brain, itching for an answer, I attempted to let go of that small detail while he continued. To spare you the details, Ill briefly list the important things he told me:\n\n* The large side of the diner was only to be used for small groups if the left side of the restaurant was full\n* The kitchen is a dangerous place so I should never go back there to talk for too long\n* No lollygagging until it is around closing time, efficiency is not achieved from horsing around\n* I would switch shifts with Megan halfway through our shifts, meaning I would have to get used to both being a hostess and a waitress (which is not anything I was ready for)\n* If I have any issues with the customers, speak to management rather than lash out and risk loosing my job\n* Never use the back door unless instructed to\n* Never talk about your job in too much detail outside of your shifts\n\nThe last two rules were strange in their own right, but Hank again reassured me that those weren't two that I would need to try and justify nor worry about too much. However, the most important detail was told to me at the very end. After visiting every area in the diner and wrapping around to the employee locker room, the chirpy man who has been guiding me for the past hour suddenly had a serious look on his face. Before, Hank only wore a soft smile and cracked occasional jokes to keep the mood light and airy. In the current moment, his eyes were glossed over with a look of solemnity and stood up straight. Whatever he was going to say next was the most crucial thing I would hear all night. \"One thing you should be made aware of might sound shocking, but I swear on my mothers grave that I am telling the truth.\" I hated when people did this, the starter off sentence that filled you with enough suspense to make you think you were about to explode. It kept you on your toes for no reason other than entertainment.\n\n\"Our diner is,well, special. I don't know if you picked up on it yet but, the patrons we serve here aren't actual people. Not anymore, anyhow. Berryspout prides itself in being a ghost diner, allowing whatever ghost roaming our town to come and sit down for a meal.\" Hank calmly explained, his arms crossed like he was my father listening to me make up an excuse when I was a kid. For what felt like hours, I remained silent. It was a mix of shock and me trying to rationalize what I had heard. But no reason I came up with was good enough. \"Ghosts?\" The question came out in a weak, near-whisper which in hindsight was a bit embarrassing. How would anyone react to that news? News that I would be serving the dead. Hank, however, looked as though he understood my shock and slowly continued. \"Berryspout is a ghost diner. Ever since our start in 1923, the dead has come here to look for a comfortable place to sit and eat. The underworld, from what I have heard from making conversation, is quite boring. It's a dark void where all you can see is specific buildings and the other ghosts. The only thing I can not provide to you is how we have the ability to serve ghouls. That is something no one has ever figured out.\"\n\nI was hung on this for days after I initially heard it. It didn't help that I was thinking about it while at work, serving people who have long since past. I felt sick during these moments of thoughts, especially when I comprehended the ghost children who came and went with their families. It was depressing and bleak to see infants and toddlers, happily ordering chicken tenders or mac and cheese like they would if they were still alive. I even tried coming up with answers on my own with the occasional help of Megan, Hank, Tyler, Jaxon, and Olivia. So far none of them seem credible. But I'll list them anyway in case someone could try and explain it to us better. Our first and only working theory is plain magic.\n\nYeah it seems silly, like Harry Potter type shit, but what else could we think? I mean whenever we walk out of the doors, everything is normal. The diner was run down and abandoned on the outside while when you stepped in, it was all perfectly neat and new with no indication of abandonment. Tyler even came up with his own little backstory about how in the 1920's there was an evil scientist who wanted to offer his mom and little sister another meal after they passed and through an explosive chemistry experience, he ripped this hole into the fabric of space and time. Eventually, that hole took the shape of a diner. Now it doesn't make sense, we know, but that is why I confided in you all. I am hoping that someone could offer a logical answer, especially now that we've been getting demons in the restaurant. They are so rude and creepy. They bite at our arms and have tried to kill us in a plethora of ways. I was sent to the hospital because of one of them on an occasion. So I guess I lied in the beginning about no bad experience. But seriously, how is this ghost diner even possible?",

It was a rainy day when me and some of my friends let’s call them Lucas, Jerry and Paul went to the woods for a camping weekend, I’m also from Russia so I’m sorry for my bad english, anyways, we got there and I was the one who was driving so I parked the car next to the entrance in the woods so it could be easier for us to find the car. We got our stuff ready such as our tents, sleeping bags etc, and we needed to make the fire before it’d get darker. Lucas said he’s gonna go search for some sticks with Jerry and they’ll be back in a few minutes while me and Paul were just chilling waiting for them to come back so we could make the fire so we can eat some marshmallows. They got back so fast forward we already ate something and we were telling horror stories to keep the horror ambience going because it was dark and only our fire was making light. Paul told a story about a creature that was living in woods and like eating everything it sees and it’s usually active at night and search for campers like us, first we got goosebumps but no one believed him because it was a legend so we remained silent so he could continue the story. Fast forward through the story Lucas fell asleep so we went to sleep too, I was sleeping with Paul and Jerry with Lucas, everyone was sleeping but at 2:12am I woke up and looked at my phone and saw the clock so that’s why I know the time, I heard a sound outside that sounded like a growl but I thought it’s a bear or something and maybe he got there because we left our food at the fire and I wouldn’t be bothered if he would’ve ate the food as long as he wasn’t about to eat us. \nI grabbed my flashlight and went outside, looked with the flashlight through the trees but it was empty, just when I was about to go back to sleep I realized that Lucas and Jerry weren’t there anymore so I went to wake up Paul and in that moment we both heard their screams so we quickly went to where the screaming was coming from and we turned into stone when we saw a big creature with red bloody eyes and evil face that was about to eat them and in that moment we heard a gunshot that scared the creature away so our friends were fine and me and Paul took them to the car and started driving home as fast as we could but on the way back home we saw the creature following us with an amazing speed and we were all scared for our lives but we somehow managed to escape alive. I’ll never forget the creature’s bloody eyes with a goat’s face looking evil. We’re all fine and we’ll never go camping again, and we managed to make that story Paul told us true.\nI know this story isn’t too creepy but it was very creepy for us to live those moments.",

        "text": "Recently, my family went through some changes in financial dynamics. It wasn't too bad, but we had to move far away for reasons I'd rather not disclose. In their rush, my parents settled for this house. \n\nIt isn't bad at all, especially for the price — even if the reason for it is quite unsettling. \n\nThe reason for this post came this morning, while I was rummaging through the attic. I needed some materials for a project, and figured my family wouldn't mind me borrowing some things. However, I got sidetracked once I came across something unexpected — a pendrive, hidden beneath some oddly cut rope, the other half of which I saw nowhere. Out of us three, I was the only one accustomed to using such devices, so its presence struck as unusual. Rather unwisely, I opted to plug it into my laptop to check its contents out. I know I could've gotten some malware, or even broken my system entirely — and my parents would've grounded me to infinity if such occurred —, but I was just too curious.\n\nFortunately, nothing insidious invaded my laptop. Unfortunately, the contents revealed something much worse.\n\nIt seems to have been written by the residence's previous owner, which piqued my interest — and eventually distress — further.\n\nI haven't apprised my parents of my discovery, as I doubt they would believe me. At first, I didn't believe it myself. I thought it was just a random scary novella he wrote. However, following some research, I'm not so sure anymore. Courtesy of the alluded to length, his passages will be split into several parts.\n\nWith context out of the way, here's what Vincent wrote.\n____________________________________\n\nIt's currently morning in my area, though you wouldn't be able to distinguish it from any other phase of day. As I sit on my desk, mustering all my strength to start typing the following out, my bedroom window gives me a view outside. An overcast sky overlooks the area, clouds meshed together, blocking any visage of the sky.\n\nThey seem to converge a few miles away, above the snowy mountains that tower over this small town. Observing the irregular landscape, I have to keep reminding myself that this is a different town — a different set of mountains, a distinct labyrinth of valleys. Most of all, I must remember — these are safe.\n\n\"Perhaps writing it all out will help you get over it,\" my best friend suggested last night, after noticing how badly I was trembling when he announced he and his family were having an outing there. \n\nOut of everyone, he's the only one with whom I have ever felt comfortable enough to share anything with over the years. But even then, he still knows much less than the truth. So many details are hidden, securely stored in my head. Actually, the entire story has remained stagnant in the depths of my mind for years now — haunting me, taunting me, terrifying me.\n\nHowever, maybe, just maybe, he is right. Perhaps sharing this with you all will finally put the memory to rest. And so, I will revisit it all this single time. This will be a long day for sure.\n\nI'm derailing, aren't I? I guess I should just start. So, let me take you a few decades back.\n\n\nIn 1996, when I was around 16 years old, me and my folks used to go on yearly winter vacations with another family. My father and mother, Jonathan and Anastasia, respectively, were very good friends with the other household's leaders, Teresa and Thomas. \n\nFrom what I heard, they were all friends in highschool and their bond carried over to adulthood. As such, this conjoined trip was tradition for them. One uninterrupted even by their offspring. And given the son's attitude, it truly was a strong bond.\n\nTheir destination of choice never changed; everytime, it was a junction of mountains and valleys. With the unchecked roads resulting from a lack of care towards the countryside, it usually took three hours to drive there. And since cars had to be left at the base, due to inclination, snow levels and the cramping amount of pine trees littering the area, we had to go an extra three hours on foot to reach our vacation residence — a wooden cabin, with no electricity, a couch, a few old mattresses and blankets and a single fireplace. During those two weeks, our diet would consist of canned edibles and bottled water.\n\n_______________\n\n\nThrough the wing mirror, I watched the tire-shaped trail my dad's old vehicle left behind as it trudged along the snow. Sometimes, it overlapped with the other family's mark, which they had carved moments before. Flakes sauntered downwards, reminiscent of gently tilting an ice globe around.\n\nDespite the freezing temperatures outside, I was cozy and warm, wearing a sweater, jacket and parka. For some reason, this stark contrast between observing the chilling cold while safe and warm always settled me into half-sleep — like snuggling down in a blanket by a fireplace. The shuffling from all the supplies in the small trunk even served as a replacement for rain noises. My eyes kept fluttering, and I expected to fall asleep soon.\n\n'A small nap wouldn't hurt,' I thought, already dozing off. If my slumber lasted too long, the others would awake me anyway. Sounds began fading out smoothly, as if someone was lowering their volume. The corners of my peripheral vision were darkening.\n\n\"Vincent, look ahead,\" my mother's voice broke in, throwing those warm blankets away.\n\nAlthough disappointed for losing the potential rest, I obliged. Squinting, I looked through the windshield. Thomas' much more commodious vehicle proceeded right ahead, allowing a decent view of the rear window. Nothing noteworthy was going on with him and Teresa, who were staring onwards like normal. However, their daughter, Maria, had her back to her parents and was waving at us. After a moment, she seemed to notice me staring back. Even with the distance and hindrances in vision, I could have sworn her cheeks reddened. \n\nIt didn't last long, unfortunately, as another teenager beside her said something which seemed to embarrass her into sitting back down. I sighed, knowing it was Justin, her older brother. To be honest, I was looking forward to interacting with Maria more personally since we had begun hanging out more during that first semester. Now that I'd been reminded of Justin's existence, multiple scenarios were running through my head; all featuring some fiasco between me and Maria, and all orchestrated by Justin.\n\nBy the time I was done reflecting, I could feel movement slowing down as we neared the parking spot. A noticeable incline lay forward, covered in white-coated woods. The layer of ground snow appeared thicker, too. This was where the valley we had been traversing ended, squashed by the elevations that had enclosed it for dozens of miles now. Contemplating how I would approach things, I decided to save more heart to heart banter for when Justin wasn't around. Surely, an opportunity for such would arise at some point in the following two weeks.\n\nOur motor gave a loud cry as movement ceased, as had the vehicle in front of us.\n\n\"All right, that was a long trip, but we're here now, son,\" dad remarked, turning around and patting my shoulder. Unlocking the doors, he headed over to Teresa and Thomas, who had exited their automobile as well. \"How are you two doing? Had a good trip?\"\n\nThomas chuckled. \"It went well enough, aside from some mopping, but that was expected.\" Both men laughed, whilst Justin groaned quite loudly from inside.\n\nOne by one, everyone else left the sheltered walls, boots leaving deep marks on the snow. The adults shook hands, hugged and all that. Me and Maria did the same; and, admittedly, I had to force myself to let go of her earlier than I would have otherwise. However, Justin just dismissed everyone, not sparing even a single word.\n\nMaria stood beside me while our parents continued exchanging conversation. \"Your brother is a bit… cranky,\" I whispered to her, side-eyeing her brother, worried he'd hear me.\n\nShe smiled sheepishly. \"Classic Justin. You already know how he is, don't you?\" she responded. It was true — I knew how he was. The three of us frequented the same highschool, and were even in the same year of education (Justin's less than model behavior had gotten him held back a year; honestly, his parents seemed more surprised that it had only occurred once thus far).\n\n\"Guess you're right, I shouldn't be surprised,\" I conceded. From the corner of my peripheral vision, Justin stared at us, that contemptuous gaze remaining. As soon as I tilted my head towards him, he diverged his eyes from us. \n\nThe adults seemed not to notice — or at least didn't see a point in getting involved. \"We can continue catching up once we've reached the cabin and settle down,\" Thomas cut in, glancing up the path we'd take soon. \"I'll gather extra firewood myself today. Want to chat with Robert and Barbara a bit; they have been a bit silent for the last few days — I suspect their telegraph is failing again,\" he elaborated, though we knew he didn't need to. Even at that age, I was aware that Thomas was the one who called the shots. He wasn't our leader, not in an enforced capacity, decisions simply tended to be made by him. His officer position in our small town likely had to do with this arrangement.\n\n\"Are you sure?\" my mother inquired, frowning slightly. She was the smarter — or at least more attentive — one of the group. If given pieces, she was the most able to solve them. If something seemed amiss about people she was acquainted with, she could associate their character, to pinpoint exactly where sketchy situations appeared off. \"Those times you fixed his stuff only happened while we were already here. Wouldn't he have gone down to town himself if days had passed?\"\n\n\"The man's just getting too old, that's all,\" he dismissed her. \"Though, I do agree he probably should move down to civilization soon. It's not a good idea for someone old to live here.\"\n\n\"He'll probably get a heart attack and die on that shit-filled bed one of these days,\" Justin chipped in with his snark — the only way he spoke. \"Maybe he collected Vincent's diarrhea from school,\" he added, his eyes darting towards me.\n\nEmbarrassment prompted me to recoil, without a way of defending myself. Justin's lips curled into a mocking smirk; tormenting me seemed to be one of the few things that brought him joy — of that I was aware of for some time now. But, in front of my parents? I never thought even he would dive that low.\n\nBefore our parents could intervene, Maria strode over to her older brother. \"Who do you think you are, huh? Because last I checked, you are the one who pours body excrement out whenever you open your mouth.\" She halted one feet away from him, facing him. Her words were unexpected, to say the least. Even Justin was taken aback for a moment.\n\nShortly after, anger replaced his momentary shock. \"What the fuck did you just say to me?\" he retorted, taking a step forward. \n\n\"Justin, stop,\" Thomas commanded, a hand tightening on Justin's shoulder. His son winced for a moment — presumably due to the force applied, which I could deduce was the amount an officer would use to casually prevent suspects from exiting crime scenes. To be honest, part of me daydreamed about Thomas tugging his son into his car like a convict. Of course, reality wasn't that perfect. \"We haven't even been here for a week, yet you're already seeking to sour things. Now, apologize to your sister.\"\n\n\"Why should I?\" he snapped back, glaring at her. He looked ready to try and punch her. \"She had no business shoving her nose into this.\" I shivered, as his intense gaze found me. \"Look at that idiot, he can't even defend himself. He needs someone else to do it for him. He deserves to be called out for what he is.\"\n\n\"I said apologize,\" his father reiterated, his grasp tightening further (looking back, that part still makes me wince). \n\nAt this point, either from the increasing strain on his shoulder or the realization that things might escalate too far for him, Justin yielded. \"Fuck, fine! Just let go of me!\"\n\n\"Tell her first.\"\n\nTurning towards Maria, he lowered his head, though his grimace never fazed. \"I'm sorry,\" he muttered, as if spitting. Immediately after, he tried freeing his shoulder, but Thomas held on.\n\n\"Don't forget Vincent,\" he told him, giving me a sympathetic look. \n\nScorching his gaze towards me, he squinted his eyes, filled with vigorous seething. My body was on the verge of entering fight or flight mode — or just flight mode, honestly. I knew my way around, so if it came to it, I would sprint off without second thought. Numbers counted down in my head, as our eyes fixed together for painfully slow moments.\n\nWithout words, Justin jerked forward, managing to catch his father off-guard. Before Thomas could react, he sprinted along the path, fading between the various trees. \n\n\"That fucking asshole,\" Thomas cursed, rubbing his forehead. \"No matter, he knows the path, and not even he's stupid enough to diverge from it. He'll get a handful first chance I get.\"\n\nSauntering behind him, Teresa massaged her husband's shoulders. \"Calm down, honey. Let's just enjoy the trip. Just let him go do his own thing — we'll set him right once we're back home.\" She embraced him, pulling on his hood to expose an ear. \"Maybe we could have some fun while the kids are away, eh?\" she whispered into it.\n\n\"Just ignore them; they're simply tired,\" my mother addressed me, though I suspected she was aware I wasn't that innocently unaware of what the couple was pondering. Seeing Maria's flustered face, it was obvious she knew it too. We were 16, after all — even back then, old enough to have knowledge on bodily pleasures, even if we didn't partake. My mother shot her own husband a vaguely judgemental look, hearing him chuckle.\n\n\"Right,\" Thomas mumbled, taking his spouse's hands, then turning around to face her. \"We will all have a great time — as with every prior year —, even if he tries to bug us.\" He let her go of her gloved-hands, before giving her a short kiss on the lips. \"I'll go check on Robert now, get that out of the way early so we can all relax.\" His gaze moved to my father. \"I assume you can take care of things while I'm gone, right?\"\n\nMy father nodded, his arm wrapped around my mother. Although not too pertaining to the following events, he had a habit of doing this sort of stuff whenever Thomas and Teresa were getting close. Perhaps it was harmless jealousy? I never did solve that question\n\n\"Just be careful, all right?\" Teresa told her husband, embracing him.\n\n\"I will,\" he assured, gently breaking off the hug. \"You be good now, dear,\" he told Maria, who nodded obligingly. Bidding everyone farewell, he set off through the uncharted path among the trees. In less than a minute, he disappeared between the pines and snow.\n\nOnce he was gone, my father turned to the rest of us. \"All right, you all heard him. I'm responsible for you all. Now, let's get going. We should be settled down by night,\" he said. From his choice of words, tone, and even forced sounding deepening of his voice, I could tell he was attempting to act like Thomas usually did. Nonetheless, we all agreed and began trudging along the path.\n\nPines littered both sides — their foliage coated in snow, which would sometimes be knocked off by gusts of wind; leaves never stayed uncovered for long, though. The trail had some turns — the casual pine blocking the path, or the odd rock formation. However, it was relatively straightforward, even if whatever indicator it supposedly had was obscured. \n\nMy father went ahead, whereas my mother and Teresa traveled behind. That left me and Maria, sandwiched between them. Something about that sibling confrontation made the current silence bothersome. Even as a non-confrontational, relatively quiet type — traits that had garnered a fair share of bullies, even if the majority had faded over the passing highschool years (most were smart enough to back off, once they began seeking someone to help them understand stuff teachers rushed over) — I found it disquieting.\n\nEventually, I had to say something. \"You didn't need to come to my aid, you know?\" I whispered so only Maria could hear. \"It was nothing I'm not used to already.\" \n\nMaria grasped my hand, as gusts of wind threatened to blow our hoods back, were they not fastened in place by the parka's collar. Internally, I panicked. Had I insulted her? I just wanted her not to feel the need to potentially make herself her brother's target for me. I wondered if, instead of those predictions relating to Justin, it was, in fact, I who would ruin the relationship — all for my careless choice of words.\n\n\"Don't,\" she whispered back, cutting off the train in my mind. Gazing at her, I could see the seriousness in her eyes; however, softness lay somewhere deep down, too. \"He's been a jerk for far too long. Not just here, but in highschool too, remember?\" With an unusually intense stare, she urged me to think. And I nodded.\n\nIt was true. Since starting highschool, back in 7th grade, he and his girlfriend, Kate, were among those who had picked me as their target. They made fun of me and messed up my stuff — Justin, in particular, cost me a project once (I still remember, several hours crafting that, all a wet mess on the floor; that remorseless smirk on his face, as the bell for the lesson rang). It was so humiliating. Whilst other bullies either grew out of it, had a change of heart, or decided being nice to me was worth the free extra lessons, Justin never moved on. He continued, threatening to beat me if I told my parents. The school was awful at communication, so I was stuck.\n\nI clenched my hand tightly; if I closed my eyes, perhaps I would feel that wooden handle again…\n\n\"I'm… sorry for bringing it up, but this is what I mean,\" Maria explained. \"I know he's threatened us both, but he'll only stop if we fight back.\" She had a hand on my shoulder, our eyes meeting.\n\nA whiff of steam left my lips, as I sighed. \"Alright, you're right. I'm just… scared of him, I think,\" I conceded, still keeping my voice low for it not to reach the others' ears. \"Remember what he did last year?\" By that last sentence, I had lowered my voice so much that even Maria, who was trudging right beside me, seemed to struggle to discern my words for a second. Or maybe it was the wind.\n\n\"I remember; that's why we can't let him continue.\" Although she leaned closer while speaking, her voice was almost fully drowned out. She put an arm over her forehead. \"I think the wind's getting worse,\" she remarked, louder now for the adults to hear. Indeed, I could see the foliage begin to shake vigorously, little mounds of snow starting to form beneath them. Flakes were falling faster and faster — the layers we were traversing would no doubt thicken considerably in the upcoming hours.\n\n\"It must be a storm,\" my mother's voice just sounded amid nature's howling. \"There was nothing about it on the forecast, though. I can't even remember we were hit by a storm here, for that matter.\" Despite how muffled her voice was, her worry still shined through. This wasn't part of the plan.\n\n\"Don't worry,\" my father's voice came next. \"It will probably pass in a day or two, if not just a few hours.\"\n\n\"What about Thomas and Justin?\" Teresa asked, her voice shrill.\n\n\"Let's reach the cabin first. Justin could have rushed there; hope he didn't try to lock us outside. If he isn't, we'll wait until either he and Thomas arrive, or the storm passes. If they're not back by then, I'll go searching, you have my word.\"\n\nThe lack of verbal objection indicated that, despite whatever deep hesitation Teresa no doubt had within, she resigned. Not that she would have had much chance, either. With how things were progressing, I wagered it would be impossible not to get lost in a few hours. Hopefully the vehicles wouldn't malfunction. Although I was always assured they could take it, apprehension still lingered in my head every time the snow fell even a smidge thicker than usual — and now this?\n\nMaria huddled to me, as we proceeded onwards. Whenever I stared upwards — imagined or not —, those cracks of sky between the foliage and white appeared darker and darker. The nature's bellowing rang in my ears, louder every time. By the time I saw our wooden shelter, I was well-aware this storm would last way longer than my father's optimistic predictions.\n\nThe door creaked, as my father pushed it open (these mountains were basically desolate all the time, and since we never kept anything of value there anyway, no one ever saw the need to put a lock). Gazing over the area, a comforting familiarity hit me. Over the years, it had not once changed. Sure, it was barren, but with the mattresses we brought, along with the firewood to light, it always became quite cozy by the end of the day.\n\nDuring the next hour, everyone worked on setting things up like usual; well, except for Teresa, who I caught staring out the front window, into the swaying woods. On that front, my suspicions were proven correct. At one point, I glanced out a back window, towards the shed — so cramped even two people coming was pushing it. Its roof was wholly pale, with elevations already forming around the structure. That tight feeling from back when I conferred with Maria about Justin came back, this time sprinkled with anxiety. \n\nAs if out of my control, I ran my fingers down the wall beside me — in hindsight, maybe I was clawing at it. They felt numb, every sensation tasteless. How long was I there? Seconds? Minutes? It could have been hours, and I wouldn't have noticed. \n\n\"Vincent,\" Maria called from behind, presumably having walked over whilst I was distracted.\n\nEmbarrassed, I relaxed, turning around to face her. \"Oh, Maria,\" I said, unsure of what to say for a moment. \"How is your mother?\" I asked, assuming that would sound natural enough.\n\nMaria sighed. \"She's still at the window. I even invited her to join me and your parents by the fire, but she declined, saying she was fine.\" After a few moments, she stared past me, into the shed. Once her eyes met mine again, her face was tinged with a bit of concern. \"I saw you looking at that. You seemed tense. Is everything okay?\" \n\nI ruffled my hair idly. \"It's nothing too bad. Just something that happened during last year's school trip.\" Looking at her, I sighed. \"I won't admit it to anyone else, but I hope our parents never let the school use this cabin again. Without them to monitor Justin, it was awful. A few days before… that happened to his girlfriend, they locked me in the shed.\" \n\nMaria was silent for a bit, just staring at me, no doubt startled by it. Even with the turmoil outside, this moment felt so quiet it seemed like we were suddenly transported inside a spaceship — someplace where one couldn't hear anything, nor could anyone hear them.\n\nI turned away from her once more. \"I know, and it makes thinking back on it so much worse. Even though she was a bully, she was still found inside those same wooden walls.\"\n\n\"Justin has no right to take it out on you, or anyone,\" Maria said, though her voice was a little closer to its usual tone — perhaps affected by the uncomfortable topic. \"But tripping and breaking your neck on the wall? That's a horrible way to go out.\"\n\nFor certain, such a random, pointless fate. Maybe not so much for the victim; stabs, drowning and burning alive were agonizing, especially when the victim realized — if they even got the chance to — that this was how their existence would close off. But for everyone else? Lines were muddier. When someone loved was murdered by another person, there was a subject to pinpoint anger and dejection at. What to do with those feelings, without a vessel to dump them on?\n\nWhat would be blamed? The irregular surface she slammed into? The owners of the property, who had clearly delimited it out? The overworked teachers, whose energy had been drained over years, and so were oblivious to her sneaking into the place while they escorted their pupils around the mountain? Whoever she and her boyfriend would probably torment next?\n\nEven if Kate's parents had taken it to court, it likely wouldn't have made much difference — perhaps that was why they simply mourned and nothing else. In the end, it was unanimously agreed the situation was a random accident, where no one was at fault (though I never mustered the courage to go around questioning anyone, I feel that, even if unspoken, a sizable amount might have blamed Kate herself).\n\nThat shed was pretty low on my visiting list, for sure. \n\n\"It is,\" I responded, trying my best to ignore that uneasy itch. \"And I don't doubt Justin's head somehow associates them locking me there a few days earlier with her death, making it my fault by his logic.\" I had to stop myself from scoffing. \n\nWithout much else to add, Maria looked at me. \"Tell you what, we'll confront him as soon as he's back.\" She offered a handshake — as if a form of agreement — and I took it. This was a side of her I'd never seen much of before, and it was nice.\n\nA few hours flew by without much of note, aside from the storm worsening. Thomas and Justin weren't back yet — I could see Teresa gradually quivering more as time passed. My father commented that someone might need to go clean out snow from the front door if this escalated for much longer. Hearing that, my mother interjected, pointing out that, with how much firewood was needed to keep the cabin warm, we may need to do an excursion for it first. No one dared to discuss which dilemma they'd rather face earlier, nor did anyone confer over Thomas and Justin.\n\nEventually, my father decided it was late enough for a nap. He offered to stay awake, but Maria shook his shoulder and asked she be the one to do it instead. Before he could respond, she glanced at me. Getting it, I raised my arm and told him I would stay awake too. He hesitated, unsure if it was a responsible decision, but soon conceded. My parents always regarded me as mature — and comparing Thomas and Teresa's attitude towards Maria and Justin, it was clear they trusted the former more. And so, following some advice on what to do if anything came up — most of which I could practically recite along with —, as well as some reassuring words for Teresa, the three adults got in their sleeping bags close to the fireplace.\n\nOnce their consciousnesses had receded, I turned towards Maria, about to open my mouth. However, with all the stress, as well as the grim memories we'd shared prior, I felt this wasn't an appropriate moment. Sighing to myself, I clutched the small heart carved out of wood in my hand, putting it back in my parka's pocket. Just in time, too, since she gazed back at me the next second.\n\n\"What do you think could be keeping them outside for so long?\" she asked, her eyes diverting to the two front windows. Night had fallen, yet nature's wrath carried on briskly. Visibility just barely extended into the woods surrounding the structure, before fading into complete obscurity.\n\n\"Talking about your dad, I'm not sure,\" I responded. Had something troubling transpired? I could imagine it relating to Robert and Barbara. Uneasiness settled in. Had something come up? Given they weren't in contact for days already, the involvement of some mechanical failure seemed feasible. We never brought any form of communication with the outside world on these trips. Signal phones that you could transport with you around reasonably were just picking up pace in developed, well-funded locations. Our town, unsurprisingly, hadn't caught up to that yet — landlines were still prevalent. And regulations prevented Thomas from utilizing police-owned devices during his absence.\n\nI was unsure if the increasing howling outside was fully occurring, or if it was augmented by my anxiety. Either way, I couldn't help but quiver. To do it in front of Maria, even if she completely understood it, embarrassed me to no end. Coughing forcefully, I composed myself as best as I could.\n\n\"Your brother could very well be playing a prank on us, no matter how extreme, or stupid, it may be getting,\" I added. \"I wonder who he's planning to prank, though. So far, the only thing he's accomplishing is getting his mother worried. I swear, that shed might become a mountain of snow before he shows up…\" I trailed off, an hypothesis popping into my mind. At my lack of silence, Maria appeared to register what I was thinking.\n\n\"Should we go check?\" Maria inquired, though I got the impression she would be inclined to wander there no matter my response. A dilemma surged in my head.\n\nOn one hand, what about our parents? My father, particularly. He already appeared embarrassed to have us stay awake instead of himself. This was, as far as I knew, one of the few times he got to take over Thomas' responsibilities, even if only briefly. If things went haywire, he'd be ashamed for sure. \n\nNot to mention, remnants of that internal panic-attack still lingered. A tingling sensation still chilled me. Chilling. How cold was it right now? Why wouldn't Justin be back by now?\n\n\"You don't have to do it if you don't want to,\" Maria remarked understandingly, but I could feel her hidden tinge of disappointment — or maybe it was my anxiety flaring again. \"I might have some trouble with clearing the door, but I can manage it on my own.\"\n\nThen again, in the event of it actually being a prank elaborated by Justin, it needed to be something big. Therefore, turmoil could soon fall down, if he wasn't stopped. There was a good chance my next choice would affect Maria's perception of me, too. With time running short, I resigned, nodding my head.\n\nSince we still donned our full attire, we just grabbed a flashlight each — Maria fetched one of the shovels, too. Tip-toeing to one of two other rooms in this wooden shell — the one I'd been previously observing the shed from —, we exited through the backdoor.\n\nThe darkness was just as imposing as I had believed and then some. It seemed visibility had decreased further in those past hours. Even the shed itself, located less than 50 feet away from the main structure, faded into a barely perceivable silhouette. The wind howled louder, more violent than I'd ever bore witness to before. Foliage rattled amidst the darkness. \n\nSuddenly Maria swerved around, darting to the door. Turning towards her, I understood why; the wind had almost thrown the half-open door against the wall beside it — one could only imagine the noise that would have produced. She'd caught it at the last moment. Although, deep down, I wasn't sure any crash would have been audible over nature's own melody. That thought made me quiver a bit, so I shook my head slightly.\n\nMaria slowly shut the door, then looked back at me. Without words, we reached a silent agreement and trudged along, our boots leaving footprints behind; however, in this brewing storm, we knew not to count on their perseverance. Flickering our flashlights on, we huddled together for warmth, as the tiny beam of light gleamed in the snow.\n\nEvery few seconds, I discreetly glanced over my shoulder, in the direction of the cabin. Despite knowing, and confirming, that it was too dark to make out, I kept doing it — not that refraining from it would have dialed my apprehension back that much. \n\nRobert and Barbara swam among the sea of my mind once more. It made no sense. Why would they risk waiting for us to come along? Especially after last year, the first time both mine and Maria's parents didn't come. Of all times to become reliant on someone's yearly outing, why right after they demonstrated inconsistency for the first time? I could recall them coming to town a few times per year — including this one —, so there wasn't any animosity towards society dissuading them from seeking help. An unpleasant sensation rose in my throat, reminiscent of vomit about to be excreted, but it clearly wasn't physical.\n\nI was brought back to attention when Maria shook my shoulder, urging me to look ahead. Doing so, I saw we had arrived. Standing in front of us was the small shed — or, more precisely, the mounds of snow covering it.\n\nRealizing just how thoroughly it was coated, confusion gripped me. Although the weather was turbulent, it hadn't quite reached such a dire level yet. Snow had risen several inches overall, sure; however, it certainly shouldn't have nearly buried an entire structure.\n\n\"How are we going to set the door free?\" Maria asked, standing right beside me, staring at the mass of snow blocking the door. The gusts of wind made hearing her difficult.\n\nWind.\n\nA plan spurred in my mind. \"I think I have an idea. Remember the window far up in the back?\" Once Maria nodded, I proceeded. \"The snow likely hasn't gotten to it yet. And I have a feeling Justin neglected to lock the door. If we remove enough snow, we could wedge our shovels in the gap between the door and the wall, then pull. We might be able to dislodge it.\"\n\n\"Alright, let's hurry,\" Maria responded.\n\nAnd so, we got to work, laboriously removing chunk after chunk of snow. My arms ached, as I launched snow to the side for the tenth time. Maria seemed to be straining as well. Minutes passed. As we exhumed layers of whiteness, my thoughts revisited Robert and Barbara. Their wrinkled faces, aging, fragile bodies — that for years stumbled in motion. Undeniably, they wouldn't fare great against the dangers of the wilderness. However, they had grown to avoid them perfectly, right? But what if there was something neither of them, nor anyone for that matter, could predict?\n\nAnd now that I thought over, was Justin really so idiotic as to not leave the shed before it was nearly buried?\n\nIn my contemplation, I didn't even realize we had removed enough snow. Snapping out of my stupor, I glanced at Maria, who gave me a confirming nod. With nature bellowing endlessly, we stuck our shovels in a gap that indeed existed, affirming my suspicions. \n\nI paused for an instant, readying myself for something I didn't know — or perhaps the possibility had settled in the corners of my mind already, and I just wanted to deny it with every fiber of my being. Taking a deep breath, I signaled to Maria. We both pulled, our bodies leaning far back. This lasted mere moments, before the door dislodged, scattering the remaining mound of snow on the ground layer. Both of us were knocked back, cold piercing through our clothing as we landed.\n\nMy head spun, as my entire being trembled. The current was hitting me directly, which wasn't good. Knowing I could end up with some disease if I didn't move out of the way, I staggered to my feet. As my vision refocused, I wished I hadn't.\n\nI screamed maniacally, which must have caused Maria to haul herself up beside me. She stared at the sight, putting her hands to her mouth. Unfortunately, she soon succumbed to her body's natural reactions, hurling onto the snow.\n\nPressed, or seemingly crushed, against the wall was a man. His limbs crooked unnaturally, with two rugged lacerations, one on each arm. Crimson had pooled beneath them, now frozen solid. He appeared frostbitten, though it was impossible to tell if that had occurred before or after he perished. I hugged Maria tightly, wanting to spare her from staring at Robert's face any longer; his contorted, frozen countenance of gaping mouth and wide, bulging sockets. Most of all, I desperately hoped she hadn't noticed the chunk of flesh missing from his neck.\n\nAnd nature just kept howling.",

        "text": "I think I'm losing my mind. Everyone I've talked to thinks I'm having some kind of memory loss, but I really don't think that's the case. I would give everything for it to only be a memory loss. Let me start with some facts. I’m 22 years old. I don’t abuse alcohol or any other substances. I don’t have any mental health problems, and my life has always been nice and peaceful.\n\nIt all started three weeks ago. I was in need of new glasses, since the last time I bought a new pair was four years ago. I’m blind like a bat without them, so the price isn’t going to be low. \n\nI was searching the internet, when an ad pops up. It seemed very much like the spam ads you get from sketchy websites, so my natural instingt was to click the x. Before I managed to do that, another ad appears on my screen. The same ad. I decided to at least read it before clicking it away, figuring that there’s no harm in doing that. It was an ad for an optician’s. The ad promised affordable quality lenses and frames. It also read, that the shop had just opened, in the city I lived in! Seemed too good to be true, but I had no extra money. That led me to write the addres of the shop down.\n\nI lost my way two times trying to find the shop. It was well hidden, next to a small pantry I remember having seen sometimes going past it. The optician’s seemed empty from where I parked my car, but the lights were on. And I was right, no one else was inside. I walked up to the counter and rang the bell.\n\n Before the sound from the bell had quieted down, a very well-dressed middle-aged man walked up to me from the back. “Well hello, how may I help you today”. The man seemed tired, but excited. As if he had been waiting for a customer for a long time. “I was looking to buy new glasses. These old ones have marks all over the lenses, and I think it’s time to change the frames also” I told him. He didn’t answer for a while. Just kept looking at me, observing, maybe hesitating about something. And then he seemed to make it, because next he said. “You came to the right place. This is after all an optician’s. Here, choose your frames and we’ll get to work.” He showed me to the shelves full of frames, in all colors and shapes. Way more than what you normally see. I took my sweet time trying on different styles, and finally decided. I chose to go with a similar style as I had before, though, a different color.\n\nI gave the man my prescription and my frame choice. He mumbled something, but I couldn’t hear what he said. “What?” I then asked. “Here. For your address”. The man gave me an annoyingly small post-it note, but I managed to squeeze my address on it. And that was it. I paid the surprisingly low price and went to make my way out. “Happy to help you see!” He waved me goodbye and I drove home.\n\nMy new glasses were on my doorstep the next morning I woke up. I woke up when someone knocked at my door. I was feeling extremely tired so I took some time to get up. By the time I got to the door, the person who had knocked was gone. My newly made glasses were laying in front of me. No package, no case or anything. I found it very weird, but I wasn’t gonna complain since I paid so little for them. And the delivery was extremely fast. So fast, I almost was going to call the optician to ask why it took so little time to make new lenses. The thought of doing that stopped when I remembered that I didn’t have the shop’s phone number written anywhere. Yes, I could have driven there and ask in person, but I didn’t think it was that big of a deal. I should’ve have. \n\n\nOver the last couple of weeks, my face seems to be changing in the mirror more and more every day. Not just the mirrors, though. Every reflecting surface, windows and small puddles on the sidewalk. When first noticed the changes, they were very small and barely noticeable, at least to someone that's not me. I have called my mom about this, but of course she didn't believe me. Even I don’t know what to think about this. \n\nFirst, my eyebrows seemed to have slightly changed shape. I thought that maybe I had accidentally shaved my brows more than intended last time, so I just shook the weird feeling off. The second change was much bigger compared to the first. I was in the school bathroom, and when I lifted my head to see myself in the mirror, my nose was crooked. I panicked. It seemed broken, but how could I have broken my nose without noticing? If it was a memory loss and I was just slowly forgetting my face, surely I'd have some medical bills or papers from the doctor if I had gone to have my nose looked at, but I found nothing. I called my mom to ask if I had talked to her something about breaking my nose recently, but she didn't recall that ever happening. She very quickly realized that something was wrong and tried to call the ambulance for me but I managed to convince her of my well-being.\n\nSecond week was even worse. I have been complimented on my healthy and thick blonde hair all my life, but now, it was ashy gray and seemed half dead. My eyes as well, the sparkle was gone. I see no life in the eyes that stare back at me. They are dark eyes, but they have a kind of milky veil over them, like you would see in a blind person's eyes. Normally my head is in the shape of an almond, but now it has a rounder feel to it, if I look in the mirror long enough. And the mouth, the mouth is the worst. Usually, when you think of a smile in your head, you see a warm and welcoming face. This is the furthest thing from that. It’s more like a grin, a deep, deranged grin. It is so wide I can see every teeth in her mouth. In my mouth. I have no idea. I'm having a hard time trying to find familiar facial traits anymore, and trust me, I have tried. \n\nNow it's the third week. My expression in the mirror seems judgemental, the face stares at me with a contemptuous look. I can't stand to look in the mirror, windows or sidewalk puddles. I covered every mirror in my house with clothes. My windows have newspapers all over them. I'm terrified of my face. Or more like what's left of it. I feel so lost. I know what I look like, I have my phone’s gallery full of selfies and pictures with my friends, where I still see my old self. But now, whenever I try to look at myself, all I can see is this old woman with the crooked nose. I haven’t taken off my new glasses, except when I sleep. Thought of that helping my situation never crossed my mind, since I can’t do anything without them. But now, I’m so scared I would much rather be blind than see this.",

        "text": "I saw my Grandma every day from the ages of two to seventeen. We were best friends. When her husband, Chuck died of unknown causes, she randomly cut ties with the rest of the family and moved. For ten years I was wondering what happened to her, and I just got the answers.\n\nA few weeks ago, I saw a YouTube video sponsored by this weird website. The YouTuber said that with this website, you can find anybody if you just put their name in. People have used this to find their family members, high school friends, and missing children. I put my Grandma's name in, and it said that she lives in the middle of Nebraska now. It gave me her picture, license plate, and everything. It was incredible to think that I could finally see my Grandma again. This whole thing gave me an idea: what if I went on a road trip to her house?\n\nAfter a few days of thinking, I finally decided that I would do it. I packed my bags and took my pick-up truck on a sixteen-hour journey to Nebraska. As I drove, the area eventually became more and more rural. At one point, the only things around me were grass, cornfields, and trees. A few hundred miles later, I was finally there. She lived in a tiny house surrounded by dozens of miles of corn. The blue paint was chipping off and the house looked like it hadn't been kept in decades. I got out of my truck and went to her front door.\n\nI had not seen my Grandma since her husband's funeral so I was incredibly nervous. As I reached for the doorbell, I could hear footsteps from the house. The door opened and a pale, old woman popped out of it. In a frightened voice, she said, \"What are you doing here?\" She sounded like she had just run a marathon. As I stared at her, I began to recognize her as my Grandmother. While stuttering violently, I said, \"Grandma?\" She said in a calm and sweet voice, \"Oh, hello honey. Would you like to come in?\"\n\nI walked into the house and plopped onto my Grandma's ripped-up couch. She looked like a wreck. I asked why she left our family, and she just brushed off the question and asked if I'd like some tea. We talked for a bit and she seemed frantic. I asked, \"Is something wrong?\" and she replied, \"I'm just a little bit worried about something.\" I commented, \"About what?\" In a stern and rude voice, she told me, \"It doesn't concern you.\" At this point, I was feeling uncomfortable. I noticed that she had food and water next to her basement door, so I asked, \"Do you have a pet now?\" She replied, \"No, unless you count it.\" This concerned me as I had no idea what \"it\" was. I said, \"What's it?\" and she replied, \"Nothing.\" Her face grew even paler than before and she seemed scared.\n\nThere was something she wasn't telling me. I told her, \"Grandma, what are you scared of?\" She said in an incredibly shaky voice, \"I'm not afraid of anything.\" She could barely speak and she seemed to be crying silently. I repeated my previous question several times before I finally received an answer. \"It lives in the basement.\" is what she said. She spoke, \"You have to leave.\" At this point, I had decided that my Grandma cut ties with the family because of drug addiction. She couldn't even make sense.\n\nI saw that she was staring at something behind me. I turned around and saw a long, black arm reach out from the basement door and grab the food that I had seen earlier. I yelled at my Grandma, \"What's that?\" She shushed me and replied, \"Be quiet. It'll hear you.\" Fight or flight kicked in and I rushed to my car as fast as I could. My Grandma came outside and yelled, \"Wait!\" As I was getting in my car, whatever \"it\" was must have heard me. I saw the creature burst through the front door to my Grandma's house. Its skin was as dark as the night sky and it was at least nine feet tall. It had these soulless dark eyes that looked like giant holes in its face.\n\nThe thing grabbed by Grandma and stared me directly in the eyes. I could feel it trying to pry my soul away from me. Without a thought, I rammed it with my truck and drove away as fast as I could. I don't exactly remember what happened after this, but I'm told that I crashed into another car at high speeds. I suffered a serious concussion and some whiplash. I'm in the hospital right now and a doctor just gave me a note from my Grandma. It reads, \"See you soon!\"",

When I was a child he was convicted for murder. He pled his innocence but to no avail. My mother never allowed me to visit, which I mean. Understandable, she was probably just horrified of him, scared of what he might be able to do. \n\nBut growing up I craved the love of a father figure, and even behind the bars, with each phone call he would bestow me with his worldly advice. It's as if prison made him a philosopher. On our last call I begged to visit him, and as much as he resisted, he gave in.\n\nA metal door was pushed open by a guard from the other side, followed by the loud bang of the door bashing off the wall. I was met by my father... I think it was my father? He looked nothing like I remember. A shellshocked version of his former self, nothing but skin and bones in his prison jumpsuit, eyes sunken in surrounded by dark circles, caused by lack of sleep no doubt. It's a scary place to be. His eyes had almost turned grey as if the soul and life was being sucked out of him.\n\nHe joined me at the table, I tried to hug him but was stopped by the shrill shouts of a guard saying I couldn't. We had a nice conversation which was cut off with the lights flickering, all the other prisoners looked at each other with a look of horror, us visitors were meeting each others gaze with a look of confusion. My dad quickly grabbed my attention again. He quickly slid me a piece of paper. *\"Read this, it's your only hope. I'm sorry I must go now.\"* Him as well as the other prisoners just began to get up and run through the metal door from where they came.\n\nI just panicked, opening the folds quickly, creating small tears along its edges. On it were a monologue and set of instructions.\n\n*\"If you're reading this, my son. I'm sorry. You for tonight will be a prisoner here with me. Just not in a conventional way. Look my cell is number 29 on the West Wing. When you can, join me. I have no cellie so just hop into the free bunk when you get here. Follow these instructions to the very letter if you want to leave tomorrow.*\n\n1. *First, you need a jumpsuit. If these \"guards\" spot you in civilian clothing, you will meet a fate worse than the frog marching, torture and solitary confinement we all endure here. Make your way to intake, just steal a uniform from behind the desk. Don't worry about locks, these things have free reign during this day, all doors will be unlocked.*\n2. *You will know when these \"guards\" are close by. You will have auditory hallucinations, so from now on do not trust your ears. If you hear my voice, the voice of your mother, friends or even old teachers, hide anywhere out of plain sight and pray. This will be painful until they pass by. The closer they are, the louder these noises will be, just beg God that they don't stop near you on their \"patrol.\"*\n3. *Once you have a jumpsuit, immediately make your way to my cell. The code is to knock 3 times quickly followed by a small delay, then knock twice more. If you experience their illusions close to my cell, don't knock. I love you but I will not be able to save you and I wish not to see your mangled corpse.*\n4. *If they find you in the canteen, you will receive some mercy. They will just make you sit down and eat, just be weary of what it is you're eating. It's not meat in the normal way. It'll probably be my old cellie in your tray. Just eat every bite and you will receive a few minutes max as a grace period, for good behaviour and all.*\n5. *Just know, these things are not human... Not anymore. No amount of begging or emotion will appease them. If you're caught outside the canteen, just say your last words. They will be courteous and offer you a last meal. After that, they will feast on you. Whatever is left will be my dinner tomorrow.*\n6. *Always avoid the wardens office, try to steer clear of it in your exploration to Intake. If you are worried about these spectral guards then you don't want to meet him.*\n7. *Finally. Just know I love you, son. With any luck I shall meet you in my cell soon enough.\"*",

        "text": "I live next to a house that is locally infamous for several missing cases involving teenage girls. It doesn't help that I'm a teenager myself, and that even though I'm nonbinary, I get mistaken for a girl due to how femme I dress and look.\n\n(And yes, my pronouns are they/them!)\n\nFor much of my life, unlike normal children who get their joy from playing with kids that live next door, I was specifically told to avoid the house where the little boy, who goes by Lyle, lives. Can you blame my parents for this? I learned about the missing cases and figured they were trying to protect me.\n\nBut I could not hold back my curiosity about this place. In fact, I wondered about what was really going on in there.\n\nIt was a few years ago that I went over to the house to ask about playing with Lyle. When Lyle came up, he asked me if I'd like to come inside and play.\n\nI didn't even make it through the door when my parents noticed and screamed the shit out of their lungs. They dragged me back to the house and scolded me for going there.\n\n\"Sage! You could have died in there!\"\n\n\"Are you okay? He didn't get to you, did he?\"\n\n\"Mom, you don't have to worry! I'm not a girl, so...\"\n\n\"You might just end up like the others if you go in there!\"\n\n\"Yeah! You may call yourself an enby, but that could have ended badly!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter I finished my homework this morning (my school is off this Friday because some of the staff got sick), I decided that I needed to find out what was happening in the house next door.\n\nMy suspicion about Lyle, who is now 10 by this point, had finally reached a breaking point such that I could no longer hold myself back.\n\nI should have noticed the signs. Today's date was the first red flag that I should have noticed.\n\nI decided not to take a direct approach. Seeing as my parents were out for the day, I figured I wouldn't have to hear such a high-pitched scream ringing out from my house even as I was going to be a Peeping Tom.\n\nAnother sign I shouldn't have ignored was that the windows had an incredible amount of tint. The drapes were pretty dark-colored.\n\nBut I could see through the window just fine, despite my nearsightedness and my not wearing my cheaters. I would have put on my glasses at this point, but what astounded me was the décor of the interior.\n\nIt had no traditional aspect to it. Crosses were everywhere for some reason. The furniture was neither bright-colored nor dark-colored. It had a neutral, grey-area aspect.\n\nInside, I could see Lyle smiling in joy, laughing and playing like a small child.\n\nHe appeared to have a toy plane that looked like that of the Red Baron from World War I.\n\nI was a little joyed to seem him playing, even as his own parents were out. But something felt creepy about the way he was playing... and the toy he had in his hand.\n\nI finally gave in to the unnatural desire to knock on the door. My heart pounding, I wanted to know more, and yet I still felt afraid of what I would say or do.\n\n\"Hello? It's Sage, your neighbor.\"\n\nI heard hasty footsteps. Lyle must have been coming to answer the door. But the footsteps echoed, getting louder with each tap, and I was sweating with fear.\n\nI know the missing cases involved teenage women. Remember that I look femme enough that I get mistaken for a girl.\n\nI put on my glasses just in time for Lyle to open the door to me.\n\n\"Hello, Sage. It's been a while. Would you like to play with me?\"\n\n\"Sure. I haven't had the joy of playing with a neighbor's kid, so...\"\n\nAnd I went inside. Boy, was I wrong to do so.\n\n\"Yo, Sage! Ever hear that no one wants to play with me and my family? Like, what happened?\"\n\n\"No idea, Lyle. Last time, my parents were sure I--\"\n\n\"Could have died? Yeah, that's what they're saying about me.\"\n\nHe seemed so much like an innocent little boy that it appeared impossible for teenage women to have disappeared in this seemingly normal house. Boy, was I wrong about that.\n\nAs soon as I went up to his room with him, an unsettling feeling came over me. The air felt heavier and heavier.\n\nI was willing to leave when Lyle looked at me and gave me a patient smile.\n\n\"Sage, come in.\"\n\nAnd when I did, you, too, would have been astonished at his room's interior.\n\nUnlike the traditional little boy's room, it was filled with seemingly religious items and what appeared to be religious books.\n\nAnother sign I shouldn't have ignored.\n\nIn the room appeared to also be a kind of table, but for what?\n\n\"Now, Sage... would you lie down there for a bit?\"\n\nLyle pointed to the table. I cleaned my glasses, and with a better look, it was a torture table thing like in those medieval movies!\n\nI should have fled then. But I was not willing to let a child cry. Even as my sweat began to get profuse, and my heart pounding so fast I thought my ribcage was going to shatter, I felt like it would be necessary to lie on it for the child to be happy.\n\n\"I need to play in this way with teenage girls to be happy.\" Lyle spoke in a voice that sounded terrifying. I should have gotten off the table and fled. But even as I felt scared shitless, I felt something weighing heavily on me.\n\nI couldn't lift myself off. Then, Lyle fastened the straps that were on the table.\n\n\"Now, what shall we play, Sage? Operation? Aggravation?\"\n\nHe'd said the names of two old board games like they were games he'd play on a girl, or an enby like me, on this table.\n\n\"Ooh, I know! Operation! You be the one I operate on, okay?\"\n\nI couldn't move. This was getting tense.\n\nMy parents were right. I could die in here.\n\nHe appeared to get pairs of tweezers. And some scalpels.\n\nHow could Lyle's parents let him play with sharp stuff like that?! Then again, Lyle's parents are pretty creepy themselves.\n\nThen Lyle went to the closet, or what I assumed to be his closet, and said,\n\n\"Wait here. I'm going to prepare you for the game.\"\n\nI should have been able to get up. This gave me a small regret about taking Estradiol; I was somewhat weak.\n\nThen he came back with what appeared to be two pieces of cloth.\n\n\"Screams will only draw others to stop the playtime, Sage. And you needn't feel afraid; you won't have to see what I will do.\"\n\nTaking off my glasses would be enough to make me blind to what he'd do, but *blindfolding* me?\n\n\"Okay, I'll prepare you now...\"\n\nAdrenaline finally got to my brain and I got up from the table. I think the adrenaline made me stronger by a bit, because I broke the straps off. He'd blindfolded me right before I did it, but I took it off, found my glasses, and I was about to break out when I realized the room had no windows.\n\nI bolted for the door, but it had been blocked off by his room's furniture.\n\nI had hoped Lyle's parents wouldn't mind a broken wall, so I just punched the wall next to the door until I had a hole. Looks and stuff didn't matter to me anymore--I was running for my life. I went through the hole in the wall, a piece of my yellow skirt tearing off in the process.\n\nI was incredibly shocked when Lyle also went through the hole in the wall. The door then swung open, revealing his room again, but the furniture didn't block the door this time.\n\nI bolted for the front door, but then it closed by itself.\n\n\"Won't you stay with me, Sage? I haven't had a playmate in so long...\"\n\nAnd Lyle had said it while *floating* in the air! He had a frickin' crimson aura around him!\n\n\"You're the first person I have ever wanted to play with who wasn't a girl. Who are you, really?\"\n\nHe knew I was an enby?!\n\n\"My parents would only bring me teen girls. They believed that guys would only kill me. But you... I'd like to know how you are neither and parentally approved.\"\n\nBig words for a 10-year-old boy. But he's not a normal human!\n\n\"All my playmates are somehow destined to die... but you? You're capable of living even as I try to play with you.\"\n\nThe front door had locked by itself. I decided that rules of keeping a neighbor's house the way you found it no longer mattered because I was in a desperate need for survival.\n\n\"Come back and play with me, Sage!\"\n\nI broke a window and was about to exit when Lyle grabbed my leg.\n\n\"Please? I have to be happy!\"\n\nI kicked him with my Mary Jane shoe and made a successful escape. Drenched in sweat and panting from all the exercise and fear, I felt happy to have survived the weird, scary kid.\n\nOf course my parents would be surprised to see me break out of that house like that. They appeared to be staring at me in utter horror.\n\n\"Sage! Sage! Are you okay?!\"\n\nI was feeling around for my glasses and then I put them back on.\n\n\"Sage, how did you--?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Mom! I didn't know what came over me, I--\"\n\n\"You've just become the first person to survive the demon Lyle!\"\n\n\"I was the first non-female person Lyle ever wanted to play with...\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I had died from the wounds or not survived my trip to the hospital, I wouldn't be posting this. I'm still taking Estradiol and my wounds are still being treated. I have no regrets about transitioning now--being an enby was helpful in my encounter with Lyle. It'll take a while for me to recover, but I am no longer afraid of anything in life.",

On May 1st I would be having a family dinner for my nephew's birthday, I had planned to leave early after I had seen Martha that day she sat with me and told me how her weekend was since I see her every week on Thursdays only. After I had seen her I went ahead and left. While driving I had a call from one of the girls working up front they said someone had brought in a girl who was 12 and was dealing with Depression and schizophrenia. I had said to let her go with the other Therapists there she had said \"no she requested you only you\". I said okay and quickly drove back to the office which when I came in I greeted the girl and said to follow me into my room. While we were walking in I could get a glance to see her mom's face she was looking at me as if she had guilt in bringing her or regretted seeing me.\n\nAfter that I went ahead and told her to tell me how she was feeling at home, her voice sounded like a creepy doll but I didn't mind she calmly said \"fine..?\" It sounded like a question to me but I didn't care I just wanted this session to be done. She didn't really like to talk as I could tell I said \"have you been doing something you'd like to share?\" I knew she had to tell me something by her face but was probably too uncomfortable  \"I did something horrible.. something cruel..\" she had said I said \"do you want to talk about it?\" \"I-I murdered my friend a week ago..outside at the park at night\" I quickly stopped writing down things on my paper \"um I-I is this true like did this actually happen?\" She nodded I quickly put my things down and escorted her out and called the cops and stated her name and age and where she lived. The cops came and took her into the cop car with hand cuffs and told me they had been looking for her since Wednesday. Still to this day I get goosebumps thinking about this everyday I go into work but me and the ladies who worked there as long as me don't speak too much about it. Still to this day I get mad because I missed my nephew's 8th birthday just to meet face to face with a killer. I tell my nephew that I missed his birthday because I had to pick out his gift because I'm overall scared to tell him. But I've been having dreams of the same girl even though this incident happened 2 years ago I still remember her and I keep having multiple dreams of her killing me and saying it's my fault and that I ruined her life..",

        "text": "Ever since I was a little kid, me and my sister have enjoyed horror. Ever since we were old enough to sit up on our own, my parents have had us watching horror movies with them. It didn't matter how gory or how violent it was, we always joyfully watched everything they put on for us.\n\nBy the time we had hit high school, my sister was dead set on writing her own horror movie. Thus, on her fifteenth birthday, my parents suprised her with her very own 1938 Underwood Champion  typewriter. To say she loved that thing would be a complete understatement. Hell, she practically lived in front of it, spending half of her time just sitting in front of it typing away.\n\nBy seventeen, she had produced about six short horror scripts, four of which would win awards from writing contests. This spurred her inspiration further until she finally began writing her self proclaimed \"Magnum Opus\". \n\nOnce she began writing this, the ammount of time she spent in front of that typewriter almost tripled. It got to the point where I barely saw her anymore, only really seeing her when she was hurryng to the bathroom or when my parents forced her out of her room to eat dinner with us.\n\nAs time went on, my sister would get more and more protective of this story. We had no idea what this movie would be about, and she would get violently defensive of its contents. If i ever saw her room empty, i would notice her typewriter was covered in a black cloth to deter anyone who may have snuck in.   \n\n\nI remember being caught in her room once during this time. My intentions were innocent enough, with me merely wanting to bring my sister a drink I bought for her from the store. But from how she reacted, I might have well have just told her I planned to set fire to her screenplay. The fury from which she decended upon me almost amazed me. She began screaming how I was \"selfish\" and was \"planning on taking her work for myself\". She stopped when my father came in and dragged me out, closing the door behind him.\n\nWe stopped trying to help my sister after that. I don't think I even saw my sister for at least a few months.   \n\n\nThen, one night, I awoke to a screetch from my sister's room. I got up, ran down the hall and threw open the door to find my sister and her typewriter gone. My mother was standing there, holding some sort of note my sister left behind.\n\nIn the note, my sister violently accused us of stealing her work. She went on and on about how she was finally happy and that we were trying to take that from her.  This horrified my family, who up to this point didn't even know what she was writing about, let alone planned on taking it from her. \n\nWe then spent about three weeks trying to find my sister. After a few red herrings she intentionally left behind to throw us off her trail, we eventually found her hiding out in an abandoned cabin that was left to rot in the woods just outside my childhood home. \n\nShe had set up a camp in it, with a makeshift fire in the middle. The fire was surrounded by empty food wrappers and dead bugs and rats. She had huddled herself in the corner of the room, crouched in front of her precious typewriter. \n\nWhen I approached her to attempt to convince her to come home, she let out an almost unhuman screech, lunging forward and tackling me to the ground. She began to strike me over and over, screaming about how I was a \"dirty little thief\". Luckily, my parents managed to drag her off of me pulling her out of the cabin.\n\nShortly afterwards, my parents had my sister admitted to an asylum. We put her typewritter in storage, with us agreeing it would be best to not read what she was writing. As we went through her stuff, I found her laptop. For some reason, I decided to go through it to see if I could find any clues about my sister's descent into madness.\n\nAfter a bit of searching, i found myself on a writing forum my sister frequented. To my shock, I found a ton of blogs my sister wrote, writing in detail about her horrible delusions about how her family was trying to plagarise her work and take it for themselves. The comments of these blogs were full of people encouraging these delusions, along with people pushing her to take action and run away. \n\nI decided to write a blog post on my sister's account, updating people on my sister's state and scolding them for how they treated my sister. To this day, there doesn't appear to be any comments except for one, from a moderator of the forum. They actually appeared sympathetic to my sister's plight, apologing on behalf of the others in the forum for how poorly they treated my sister.\n\nI told my parents about what I found, with them contacting my sister's psychiatrist to tell them about my findings. They contacted us a few days later with a concrete diagnosis for my sister.\n\nTheir official diagnosis was chronic paranoia, which the psychiatrist hypothesising that my sister could've had Schizoaffective disorder as a result of some form of trauma from her childhood.\n\nI haven't seen my sister since, besides one time where I grew the courage to visit my sister. She seemed significantly calmer, even apologizing for how she accused me.  I apologized on behalf of the writing forum she was apart of, with her agreeing on how unhealthy it was for her to be apart of it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI keep having urges to read what her screenplay was about. What was so precious that she had to hide it from us?\n\nI guess I'll never know.",

        "text": "A lot has changed over the course of this last week. I decided to finally leave my house after not hearing from anyone for 11 days now. I figured if something had taken over my social network but hasn’t gotten to me, the last thing I should do is leave the house. This is the only place where I can feel some form of safety after all. I stand up to these entities sometimes but going out regularly in this scenario is just asking for you to not be seen again. \n\nNothing in my house had any leads onto what was happening so I figured I’d make a stop to the back rooms of the library. Whenever information on supernatural entities or anything alike is given to the library amongst other reading materials, they always set it aside. The majority of the world considers most of this information as compelled useless. Stories at best. But if they looked at little deeper into our world they’d realise these are the most valuable things we can have to help overcome the darkest elements of our lives. \n\nThe librarians know only a select few people would put this to use and you need to build that notoriety to have access to the backroom. Over the last decade and a half I’ve done exactly that and if there’s anytime that I’d need to visit them, it’d be now.\n\n I made a calm and collected walk to the car, I knew something out here could be waiting for this exact moment, but I didn’t want them knowing I was prepared for it. I had a small pistol my my waist band and metal lining under my shirt. It wouldn’t be enough to kill anything, but it’d be enough to keep them off me until I was inside of the car. My car is filled with every charm necessary, crammed under the seats,  hanging from the mirrors and covering the dashboard. God knows what other drivers think of me when they look inside while I’m driving past. \n\nDespite all of this, I made it to the car without anything out of the ordinary happening. You’d think this would be fantastic, but many creatures function off instincts, a lot like an animal. They just see you as prey or some just kill for fun. Clearly whatever was around me had some sort of intellect, or simply wasn’t here at all. Regardless of the 50/50 I had to treat it as if I was being stalked. \n\nDuring the car ride into town my head started aching and I was struggling to focus on much, but I noticed it was almost silent. I figured I should see at least a few cars passing by, it was early on a Monday, but I was yet to see anyone. My head felt as if it was being compressed and I was debating turning to just go home and getting back to sleep until it had worn off. I decided I was almost in town and I’d get some medication to try and understand what was happening. I felt as if I’d already left it too long, no more procrastinating.\n\nI pulled up in-front the store and once again found it empty, but my head was under so much pressure I couldn’t find room to care. I tore a pack of antibiotics off the shelf and stumbled into the bathroom. I crashed through the door and pulled myself up toward the sink. As I went to turn the tap on I looked up into the mirror. It was empty. I could see straight through myself. The corners at the top starting folding into each other and I saw a deep, gravitating abyss behind it. \n\nI threw up across the sink and closed my eyes. I wasn’t able to focus on what the fuck I’d just seen I was too distraught. I opened my eyes and I was back in my car. The overstimulation I was experiencing was enough to throw me into a frenzy but I couldn’t feed into it now. \n\nI didn’t want to blink again but my head was in so much pain I had to. In the few seconds before I had to prepare myself for whatever I might find before me. I opened them again and I was in between my car and house again, but everything around me was warped inwards and each edge and corner felt like it was tearing at my mind. Every detail of the world looked like fingers and hands trying to grab at my existence. I could feel the prickles on the sides of my head as I tried filtering through my keys to get back into the house. \n\nMy ears were ringing and my throat was so dry I couldn’t swallow anymore. It felt as if all existence was trying to compress me into one atom. I felt the key slide into the door and I clattered through. \n\nSerene. My head almost exploded at the release of pressure. My ears went mute for a few seconds as I adjusted to normality. I pulled myself up against the wall and looked out the front door. The air was vibrating in the door frame, every little colour and feature outside the house was distorted into one. It looked like space was trying to invade my own house. The hinges of the door started rattling and I slammed it shut instantly. I couldn’t handle whatever that was being inside my house as-well. I felt vacuum packed. Every window and door to my house creaked and groaned under whatever was pressuring against it.\n\nI fear if I don’t figure out what’s going on I’m going to start hearing splinters in the doors and cracks in the window. But if there’s anything I’ve learnt, the supernatural always has at least one way where you can win. My friends aren’t the one under attack, I am. I was looking for the wrong things for too long and now I’ve been pinned down to my own house. After having enough time to sit with what’s happened I think I know what’s going on. \n\nNo creature is trying to kill me. The darker world is trying to take me, to remove my history from this world. I don’t know if they want me to be one of them, or if they want to diminish my existence, but I think I know how to find out. There’s always one way out, and I know mirrors have never done what I saw today. I need to take a closer look in my bathroom.",

        "text": "Taking in the sick display my mother had greeted me with, I was unable to contain my terror. The way the slaughtered doe's glazed eyes looked up at me, my mother's completely vapid stare as penetrating as it was numb while she kept nursing that fucking wineglass… it was too much.\n\nI doubled over and emptied my stomach onto the floor.\n\n*What had become of my mother?* \n\nI had this feeling of disconnect again, like my body wasn't mine to control—my soul's absence was making itself painfully noticeable in my state of distress. Nevertheless, I found my fingers trembling as beads of cold sweat ran down my skin. My guts were still churning, and I was whimpering like a dying cat. \n\n\"Mom?\" I pressed out, tears rolling down my cheeks. \"Please, I want my mom back.\" \n\nI don't know why that was the only thing I could think to say, but my mind was in another place entirely. The carnage didn't matter anymore. The buzzing noises didn't matter anymore. All that mattered was my mother. Just to remind you, I was in my mid twenties when this happened, but my fear for my mother was reducing me to a much more vulnerable state. I felt like a kid again, and I was just about ready to pee my pants, but I had to pull myself together. \n\nI took a cautious step towards the familiar woman who was sitting there, unmoved, in a bloodbath of her own creation. I extended my hand to her. \"Mom? Let's go upstairs. Let's go lie down.\"\n\n\"But I just slept the whole night long.\"\n\n\"I think it hasn't been quite enough,\" I pressed out, trying to hide the tremor in my voice.\n\n\"If you say so.\" Mom rose from her seat. \"But remember, you're a part of him, and he's a part of you.\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\nIgnoring my question, she latched onto my arm. \"He has a deep, *deep* lust for you, Fiona. But don't be afraid. It's the same lust he feels for everyone, and everything… because we're all part of him, you know?\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" I muttered, voice brittle. I had a feeling she was trying to tell me something of actual relevance, but whatever madness had taken hold of her didn't let her. \n\n\"It'll be over soon. He never needed me, but he's getting old… Old, old, old and so vulnerable… He'll need you, and you need him.\" She paused to take a long, wheezing breath. \"His love is lust, and his lust turns into hunger, and he keeps confusing the three.\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\"\n\n\"Oh, it'll be over soon, honey, don't worry so much. I'm sorry for the mess.\" She let out another sigh as I guided her into her bedroom and allowed her to gently lower herself down on the mattress beside Dad. He had already sat up and was regarding us in bewilderment, but I motioned for him to stay quiet. \n\n\"I do so miss my little boys. And the one with the fire in his throat, I miss that one, too.\"\n\nI swallowed audibly as I reached for the blanket to tuck her in. She looked so tiny all of a sudden. \n\n“I love you, Fiona.” Mom closed her eyes, grasping my hand in hers. \"This is the hard part,\" she whispered. Her head hit the pillow and she drifted off to sleep in an instant. \n\nMy father and I exchanged stupefied glances. “You don’t wanna see what happened downstairs,” I informed him. “I’ve gotta go clean up. Keep the others up here until I’ve given you the green light. We need to talk about getting her admitted later, we’ll have to call a doctor or something, I don’t know…”\n\nI started trudging down the stairs. Our house had gotten very empty over the last couple years. Jem had already left us a long time ago, Cas had launched his career and moved out a couple years prior, so my sisters were the only kids who still stayed at our place, aside from myself. For as long as I can remember, it had been set in stone that I would be the one to inherit the land. I think my mother had known that from the moment she popped me out, and she’d started making her expectations very clear to me in my early twenties. Honestly, part of me had already known there was no escape for me, no life outside the forest. I spent many years in denial about that. By the time this happened, though, I knew my place. I knew it would always be me who’d have to deal with the bloody shit.\n\nI got nauseous several times while tidying up the kitchen. The doe wasn’t particularly easy to carry, and the flies and the stench didn’t help. At some point, I just sort of mentally disconnected from everything. My mind was somewhere far, far away while my hands picked up and scrubbed the plates and wiped the blood off the table. My legs carried me out the door as I dragged the doe outside, leaving a bald valley in the fresh snow as I crossed the yard with the cadaver in tow. My back was starting to hurt. I let go of the doe and straightened up to stretch, only to bump into someone who’d been standing right behind me. I whipped my head around to find myself face to face with the Leshy, who had mercifully adopted his human form, lest I would have likely suffered cardiac arrest. \n\n“Bring me food, there, heiress?” He pointed at the doe.\n\n“Well, you can have it, I guess,” I muttered, still sort of shaken. “You’d just give me shit otherwise, right?”\n\n*Oops. Probably shouldn’t talk like that to the Lord of the woods.* It had kinda just slipped out. I was still in a daze, my tongue acting on its own. I was already preparing for hell to break loose, but the Leshy actually started smiling.\n“Oh, I’ll give you more than enough *shit* in your lifetime, Fiona.”\n\nFiona. Hearing my name from him was always beyond eerie. I gritted my teeth but refrained from commenting.\n\n“But not now,” the Leshy clarified graciously. “Although I do like company while I eat.” He cocked his head.\n\n“Please no,” I mumbled wearily. \n\nHis smile grew wider as he pointed at the ground. “Sit.”\n\nI sighed very deeply before gathering my skirt at my sides and plopping down. I tried not to watch as the Leshy knelt down, setting his cudgel aside and reaching out his hand, proceeding to plunge it into the carcass, somehow instantly piercing the skin. His fingers coaxed a disgusting squelching noise from the doe’s insides as he started rummaging around in them. Just as I thought the sound was going to make me throw up again, he pulled his arm back out, producing something red and drippy. It took me a while to realize it was the doe’s heart. He held it out to me.\n\n“Take a bite,” he invited.\n\n“No, thanks.”\n\n“Take a bite,” the Leshy repeated.\n\n“Thanks but seriously, no.”\n\n“Fiona.” This time, it sounded like a threat.\n\nSo I started crying. \n\nThe Leshy just kind of looked at me with wide eyes before sinking his teeth into the heart himself, chewing pensively. “What’s wrong?” he asked, not bothering to swallow before speaking up. \n\nI kept bawling, gurgling incoherently. The wood-demon was beginning to look a little put off, but he didn’t stop eating. We must have been quite a sight sitting there together. I think I was starting to make him uncomfortable, if he was able to feel something of the sort. \n\n“There, there,” he said softly, still chewing as he rose to his feet. “Relax, I need you to hold still for a moment.”\n\nSomehow, I was overcome by the sudden urge to obey. He grabbed my face and pried my mouth open. I was too shocked to move; it just happened so fast. He leaned down and spat the stinking, foul red mush his teeth had turned the doe’s heart into right down my throat. He held my gaze the entire time, clasping my mouth shut the second the last bit of red had landed on my tongue. My fear reflected in his steely eyes, tears kept on rolling down my face. \n\n“You need to swallow now.”\n\nI shook my head, letting out a choked sob as I tried to ignore the rotten taste. \n\n“I’m not letting you go until you swallow.” He sighed, readjusting his grip. “Come on, don’t make this any harder than it needs to be. Trust me, you’ll thank me for this.”\n\nSomething about his tone was oddly disarming. I squeezed my eyes shut, grimaced and gulped it down. He removed his hand and I stuck out my tongue to prove there was nothing left. The effect hit me immediately as I was overcome by a serene, pulse-slowing calmness. The tension disappeared from my shoulders and I let go of a long breath, wiping the tears from my puffy red cheeks. \n\n“Feels good, don’t it?” the Leshy asked.\n\n“This is sure to make me sick,” I grumbled.\n\n“It won’t. Sure, it’d be tastier if it were fresher, but it serves the same purpose. The flesh of a doe from these woods steels the nerves when consumed raw.”\n\n“Huh. Why’d you have to make me eat the heart, though?”\n\nHe looked seriously puzzled. “Well, because it’s the best part?” Shaking his head at my cluelessness, he added, “I saw your mother slay this one last night. She looked quite out of it, waltzing through the darkness with that machete on her…”\n\n“I think she’s dying,” I blurted out. “I don’t know what’s going on with her. She seemed fine yesterday, but then she started talking about the huldufólk, whatever that is; and now she’s just gone completely crazy, she’s not making *any* sense…” I had to catch my breath before carrying on, but the Leshy merely held up a hand, cutting me off.\n\n“I’ll warn you not to speak too loudly of the huldufólk. There are forces here that even I find difficult to control.” He paused, regarding me with something akin to pity. “I understand that this will be hard for you, gentle soul. But trust that all pain and grief shall pass someday. That’s what I’ll leave you with. Return to your mother, stay by her side and if you can, bid her farewell from me, too.”\n\n“So she really is going to die?”\n\n“The huldufólk have to pay their toll to hell, heiress.” He stood up and, to my surprise, helped me to my feet. “I’ll take the carcass off your hands. What belongs in the woods will be mine again. Run along, wench.”\n\nNot wanting to overstay my welcome, I headed back to the house as fast as I could. I didn't think that the Leshy had lied to me, and that assumption was confirmed when I heard a hair-raising cry the moment I burst through the front door. It was my mother's voice, agonized and frightened, coming from inside the master bedroom. I found my father at the top of the staircase, looking down at me and frantically motioning for me to hurry. We hastened down the hallway together, telling the girls to stay in their rooms as they briefly stuck their heads out.\n\nWe shoved open the bedroom door just in time to see Mom crawling off the bed on her hands and feet, facing the ceiling in a grotesque, spider-like manner, howling like a banshee. It was probably the most horrifically gruesome sight I ever had the displeasure of beholding, but the doe’s heart had not yet ceased to affect me. The unnatural, relentless calm allowed me to break through my mental fog and rush to my mother’s side, gathering her frail, writhing body in my arms and forcing her into a hug. Dad was screaming; in fact, he couldn’t stop screaming; he was clawing at the skin of his own face, tugging on his hair and wailing, until I turned and told him to finally shut up. I understood the sentiment perfectly, but some daughterly instinct of mine told me that these were my mother’s last moments. I didn’t want her to meet her death surrounded by panic and despair.\n\n\"Mom?\" I whispered to her as the haze in her eyes let up.\n\nHer chapped lips stretched into a wan smile. She didn't say anything, merely grasped my arm with her fingers. Her hand was incredibly cold. I pulled her a little closer and she let out a low moan.\n\n\"Fiona,\" she rasped out.\n\n\"Mommy, I'm here.\"\n\n\"Is it okay?\"\n\n\"Sure. Everything's okay, Mom.\"\n\n\"Fiona… I'll be going now.\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\"Are you…\" Her voice faltered and she swallowed. \"…gonna be okay?\"\n\n\"I'll be fine, Mommy.\" I buried my face in the crook of her neck as she weakly wrapped her arms around my shoulders. \n\n\"See you when you're ready, honey,\" she muttered into my ear before her head dropped onto my chest. I sat there on the floor, cradling her until I was afraid her body would begin to stiffen. I laid her out on the bed. Her eyes were shut, her mouth slightly curved. I hadn't expected this, but she actually looked peaceful. The minutes preceding her death had been fearful and excruciating, but the moment itself had been harmonious.\n\nThe ground was frozen and rock-hard when Dad and I dug out the grave. It wasn't easy, but we managed. We laid her to rest beneath the red meadow, calling everyone she was close with as well as the extended family. Jem didn't show up, but Cas obviously came and so did Mom's sisters and brothers from out of state. We hosted a small gathering at our house. Cas and the girls cried their eyes out. Dad kept his composure during the funeral service, but afterwards, he was never the same. No matter how often they'd fought, no matter how many times Mom had cussed him out and he'd compared her to other women, her demise left him adrift and just utterly shattered. As soon as my sisters were out of the house, he moved to some sunny place where he could ogle bikini babes and pretend he hadn't lost the love of his life.\n\nSo I told all this to Jacek as we sat on the couch. Most of it, at least. \n\n\"I'm really sorry,\" he said when I concluded my report. \"I didn't mean to tear open any old wounds.\"\n\nI regarded him with a tilted head. \"You haven't seen Mom down there by any chance, have you?\"\n\n\"In hell? No. That's not quite how it works. Not everybody gets… that kind of an afterlife.\"\nHis eyes were glistening a little. \"Sorry,\" he repeated, stealthily wiping the moisture away. \n\n\"It's cool.\" Cas had wrapped his arms around me from behind, his chin on my shoulder. \"C'mere, man. Triple hug. I know she meant a lot to you.\"\n\nJacek gave him a weird look but, after a moment of consideration, very briefly joined us to form a warm, comfortable sandwich. After a few seconds, he drew back and awkwardly cleared his throat. \n\n\"Two things. Remember that dog I had with me sometimes?\"\n\n\"Sure do.\"\n\n\"It's not still around by any chance, is it?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" I replied. \"We ran into it a couple days ago. Seemed to miss you a lot, it still knew me…\"\n\n\"Huh. Who woulda guessed. I thought it hated the surface. Always considered myself selfish for summoning it in the first place. Wow, I feel, like, twice as shitty now.\" He coughed. \"Anyways, second question—did you ever find out more about the huldufólk?\"\n\n\"Nope.\"\n\n\"Well, no matter.\" A sly grin began to unfurl on his lips. \"I might have an idea.\"\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)\n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zy4auu/to_all_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_stay_the_fuck/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zyzp01/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_yuletide/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/100lj37/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_i_found/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/101n4rg/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_my/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/102jqcy/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_theres/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 6](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/103yryr/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 7](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/105nlp7/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_some/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 8](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1071bxu/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_jacek_of/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 9](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1085qzf/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_heres_why/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 10](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1095w2g/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_freak_deer/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 11](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10a5ij3/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_so_my_ex/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)",

        "text": "\nI think I'm losing my mind. Everyone I've talked to thinks I'm having some kind of memory loss, but I really don't think that's the case. I would give everything for it to only be a memory loss. Let me explain.\n\nOver the last couple of weeks, my face seems to be changing in the mirror more and more every day. Not just the mirrors, though. Every reflecting surface, windows and small puddles on the sidewalk. When first noticed the changes, they were very small and barely noticeable, at least to someone that's not me. I have called my mom about this, but of course she didn't believe me. I don't even know what to think about this. \n\nFirst, my eyebrows seemed to have slightly change shape. I thought that maybe I had accidentally shaved my brows more than intended last time, so I just shaked the weird feeling off. The second change was much bigger compared to the first. I was in the school bathroom, and when I lifted my head to see myself in the mirror, my nose was crooked. I panicked. It seemed broken, but how could I have broken my nose without noticing? If it was a memory loss and I was just slowly forgetting my face, surely I'd have some medical bills or papers from the doctor if I had gone to have it looked at, but I found nothing. I called my mom to ask if I had talked to her something about breaking my nose recently, but she didn't recall that ever happening. She very quickly realized that something was wrong and tried to call the ambulance for me but I managed to convince her of my well-being.\n\nSecond week was even worse. I have been complimented on my healthy and thick blonde hair all my life, but now, it was ashy gray and seemed half dead. My eyes as well, the sparkle was gone. I see no life in the eyes that stare back at me. They are dark eyes, but they have a kind of milky veil over them, like you would see on pictures of blind person's eyes. Normally my head is in the shape of an almond, but it has a rounder feel to it, if I look in the mirror long enough. I'm having a hard time trying to find familiar facial traits anymore, and trust me, I have tried. \n\nNow it's the third week. My expression in the mirror seems judgemental, the face stares at me with a contemptuous look. I can't stand to look in the mirror, windows or sidewalk puddles. I covered every mirror in my house with clothes. My windows have newspapers all over them. I'm terrified of my face. Or more like what's left of it. I feel so lost. I know what I look like, I have my phone gallery full of selfies and pictures with my friends, and still look like my old self. But now, whenever I try to look at myself, all I can see is this old woman with the crooked nose. What could this be? What does she want from me?",

Every time he opened the box’s lid and found me alive, he grimaced, but of course he couldn’t admit how badly he wanted me dead.\n\nInstead, his frustrations boiled over to the world above. Almost daily, he would come down the stairs covered in blood, often wounded. Once, he even had me sew up a bullet wound on his left arm. Of course, he dismissed the close calls as par for the course, narrating the history of his other scars:\n\n“See that one there? That was twenty years ago now. She stabbed me from behind with a fire poker. Two inches to the left, and it might have pierced my heart.”\n\nHe turned and looked at the scissors in his hand.\n\n“Do you know what it takes for me stop myself from stabbing you? Every sinew of me calls for it. How beautiful the arterial spray would appear as you gasped your last breaths. But I know that my patience will be rewarded. The box will claim you. And finally, I will add the sweet red of you to my work.” He gestured to the red and white stained glass on the nearby wall. \n\nI was wise enough not to comment. Even my slightest misstep those days meant hours, sometimes days in the box.\n\nBut of course, he always found a reason. Dutifully, I would lie inside, and he would close me in.  \n\nBy then, however, I saw the box as an escape from his cage. The dark half-death inside the sarcophagus had become my real life, while my time with him was death, my season in the underworld. \n\nIn the deathscape within the sarcophagus, the other girls had nearly completed their pyramid. They could reach up from the top now and brush the door to my world with their ethereal fingers. When they did, I felt them entering my mind for a few seconds at a time, their thoughts mixing with my own.\n\n*It’s so cold in here. I forgot what cold felt like.*\n\n*Our heart is so loud.* \n\n*Our body is so frail. Mine used to be so much stronger.*\n\nI knew that I had made a bargain with the ghosts. That we would escape together or not at all. Still, I wondered if I would come to regret my decision. I had always been an introvert. Now, I was constantly entertaining guests, never alone, never able to stop and think without a dozen or more voices all speaking at once.\n\n*The way out is in all four directions at once.*\n\n*North, south, east, and west.*\n\nThe four buttons lay all around me, but I had yet to discover how to press all four at once. I could reach south with the tip of my toes, east with my hand and north with my other hand, but that left west to deal with. \n\nEach day, I crossed my right leg up and across my body, trying to angle the toe toward the button, but the task proved nearly impossible in the small space. The box was so tight that the leg would get wedged perpendicular to my body as I tried to pull it into place with both arms. Sometimes, it felt like it would break. And still, I pushed harder.\n\nOnce, the Keeper opened the lid to find me in that contorted position, my leg stuck against the box’s side, my foot almost at my hip. He looked at me curiously.\n\n“Cramp,” I rasped out, my lips cracked and bleeding.\n\n“That was 36 hours,” he said. “No one has survived that long.”\n\nAnd for the first time since he’d captured me, I could see his fear. For weeks he had looked at me like a steak ready to be eaten. Now he could barely look at me, the way prey avoids the eyes of a predator.\n\nAnd something snapped in me that moment. I saw *myself* as a ghost, a revenant returned from the other side. And I spoke words I never would have dared voice even a few days earlier.\n\n“You told me you were a god,” I whispered. “That we girls come and go, but you’re always here. I’m here to tell you, I’m the deathless one. No length in the box will end me. I will bury you.”\n\n“Prove it then!” he shouted, kneeling over me. I could tell it took everything in him not to wring the life from my body. But I suppose he had his rules. \n\nHe slid the lid of the box back on top of me.\n\nI found the girls standing atop the pyramid, waiting for me. The structure was complete now, offering easy access to the door of light. \n\n“We heard you,” said Brianna. “You were right. He’s only a man.”\n\n“Not that it matters if I die in that box,” I said bitterly.\n\n“Together,” said Naomi. “We escape together.”\n\nThen, one by one, they pulled themselves up through the door. \n\nMy head felt like it would burst as they entered. Each of them felt like a marble crammed into my skull swelling my brain. Before, they’d only been visitors. Now, they were moving in complete with all their luggage: memories, and fears, and dreams. \n\nFor a moment, I thought I might be erased, or mixed together with the ghosts. That the colors of each of us would be mixed into a muddy brown.\n\nBut it was not the case. Somehow, I made room for my visitors, and we all stayed distinct. Eighteen souls in one body.\n\n*I’m alive.*\n\n*But this body is so weak. When was the last time he gave us water?*\n\n*This body can’t take much more. It’s practically done.*\n\n*So we get out now. No more time to waste.*\n\n*All directions at once.*\n\nI reached out for the buttons, but it wasn’t just me this time. Eighteen invisible hands moved together as I shoved my leg in place. The pain was beyond anything I’d ever felt before or since, like the leg bone would be crushed to powder. \n\nBut together, we pulled, and finally my toe reached the East button.\n\nI pressed all four buttons at once, and I heard the gears turning. I had assumed the lid would open, but something else happened instead: a compartment opened just above my chest, and something fell onto me. I reached for it with my hand and nearly cut myself.\n\n*A dagger.*\n\n*Still sharp after 6,000 years.*\n\nThe Keeper was in terrible shape when he opened the box. He had been stabbed at least three times in the arm and shoulder. I lay weakly in the box, barely able to lift my arms. I lay with them crossed over my chest, the blade concealed beneath them.\n\n“Get out,” he said. “You’re welcome, by the way. I cut your time in there short.”\n\n“Because you need us to stitch you up,” I said.\n\nHe bristled climbed on top of the box on all fours. He leaned over me, his rancid breath filling my nostrils. \n\n“Never forget,” he whispered. “However important you think you are. Whatever lie you tell yourself. You. Are. Replaceable.”\n\nI stabbed forward into his chest, just where he’d once told me his heart would be. And it wasn’t just me doing the stabbing. Together, I felt eighteen sets of other hands pushing along with me, driving the dagger home.\n\nThe blade slid through the flesh like a diver through water. Blood instantly poured from the wound, and the Keeper fell on top of me. \n\nOur faces pressed close together, he looked into my face, fear filling his eyes.\n\n“You…” he said weakly. “All of you…”\n\nAnd then he died, just like any man.\n\nI would have thought it difficult to wriggle out from under him, but I had the help of the other girls. Together, we worked ourselves free and exited the box, leaving him inside. Then, slowly, we walked over to the door of the room, opened it, and trudged up the stairs to the world above.\n\nAt first, when I made the deal with my eighteen sisters, I was afraid. But I realize now it was never necessary. We work well together, sharing the body. \n\nNaomi takes over during my piano lessons, and Brianna takes the wheel during most of our dates. Others like to go on runs or study history. We’ve all taken an interest in ancient cultures. \n\nAs for me, I like it in the dark. Because indeed, we brought the dark with us when we left the box. \n\nI like to sit by the base of the pyramid, watching the river of mists pass. I am no longer afraid of it.

        "text": "I don't remember much about my imaginary friend, and things I do remember, my parents told me about. I live on a fairly secluded farm in the middle of nowhere, with the nearest neighbors living half an hour drive away. \n\nI'm married to an amazing woman, with whom I had a son. Tristan is currently 4 years old. \n\nIt started about 4 months ago, I noticed Tristan playing and laughing on his own, which isn't unusual for children his age, but is unusual for Tristan. He's an attention seeker, he can't have fun without either his mommy or daddy. So while I was glad he finally decided to play on his own, it was also a little weird. \n\nI walked up to him with a big grin on my face. \"Who are you playing with Tristan?\" \n\nHe looked at me, his expression showing a hint of confusion, then he looked away, nodded at something, and looked back at me. \"With my friend!\" He exclaimed proudly. \n\nI remember thinking that maybe an Imaginary friend isn't such a bad idea for him. \"Oh really? what's his name?\" \n\n\"He doesn't want me to tell you.\" Tristan responded, still playing with his toys. I shrugged it off.\n\n\"Alright, have fun.\" I said and walked off into the kitchen.\n\n\"Well?\" My wife asked me. \"Imaginary friend.\" I smiled at her, we highfived. All this meant was we had some more time on our hands since Tristan decided to play with himself, or his imaginary friend. \n\nAnd while it was innocent and sweet at first, things began getting weird. \n\nOne day I heard something shatter in the direction of Tristan's room. When I got there my wife was already scolding Tristan. \"Why would you take the glass and shatter it?\" \n\n\"I didn't!\" Tristan was crying. \n\n\"Then who did?\" My wife asked. \n\n\"My friend!\"\n\n\"Oh really? Where is he now?\" \n\nTristan took a quick glance at the doorway, and then shrugged. I walked up to my wife and put my hands on her shoulders. \"It's alright, we'll clean this up.\" \"And Tristan, if your friend does something like this again, we won't let you play with him anymore, got it?\" I tried to play the mediator. Tristan nodded profusely. \n\nBut that wasn't the end of it, things just kept happening around Tristan, and each time he'd blame his friend with no name. \n\n\"Okay so what is your friends name?\" I was getting upset, angry almost. \n\n\"He doesn't want me to tell you!\" Tristan shouted in between sobs.\n\n\"Well I want you to tell me!\" I shouted back, feeling bad right after. \n\nTristan began sobbing even louder. My wife gave me a look. \n\n\"Why are you so hellbent on finding out some imaginary's friends name anyway?\" My wife whispered to me while Tristan was sleeping on her lap. \n\n\"Because I had an imaginary friend too when I was his age.\"\n\nMy wife gave me a questioning look, like how is that relevant to now?\n\n\"I also used him as an excuse for misbehaving.\" I rubbed my neck, feeling a little embarassed.\n\n\"And did he have a name?\" My wife asked. \n\n\"Boo.\" I replied. I watched as my wife's face dropped and she glanced at Tristan. \n\n\"Everything okay?\" Her expression was worrysome.\n\n\"His friend's name is Boo..\" She said slowly. \n\n\"How do you know?\" I asked her, feeling a slight tremble at my finger tips. \n\n\"I overheard Tristan refering to his friend as Boo.\"\n\nWe both sat in silence for what felt like hours. \n\n\"How did you get rid of him?\" My wife finally asked. \n\n\"I don't remember. I think I just grew out of it.\" \n\nShe was looking at Tristan with so much care and worry, and Tristan was in deep slumber, completely oblivious to it. \n\n\"Want me to call my parents and ask?\" \n\n\"Please.\" She looked up at me. \n\n\"Alright.\"\n\nI called them the next day and they were surprised that I brought up Boo, after a short conversation they agreed to come over for dinner and to talk about it. \n\nWe made sure Tristan was occupied and wouldn't overhear our conversation by letting him eat dinner first, and then go play with his grandpa. \n\n\"You know you used that damn imaginary friend as an excuse for everything.\" My mother giggled at the memory, but then her expression grew serious.\n\n\"And a lot of disturbing things happened, things that we knew you never could of done.\"\n\n\"Like what?\" My wife asked. Even I couldn't remember what it was.\n\n\"I woke up one night, you were six, Aarlon.\" She gazed outside as she spoke.\n\n\"I was thirsty and walked to the kitchen to grab a glass of water. As I was walking through the hallway, I noticed the front door wide open.\"\n\nMy wife was listening in intently. Meanwhile I was somewhat distracted, my attention on the sounds of my father and my son playing in the other room. Their laughs and giggles warmed my heart. \n\n\"I was too tired to think on why it was open, so I just walked over and wanted to close it, but then I noticed the stable gate wide open. I began walking to the stable and heard noises- giggles. It was your voice Aarlon.\" \n\nI explored my memory, trying to find the moments she was describing, but it was all blacked out, as if erased from existence. \n\n\"I sneaked over to the stables and peeked inside. You were sitting on the ground, your legs crossed, you were pointing with your finger and giggling at something. Then I saw a knife just floating towards you, I didn't know how the fuck it was possible, but the knife just flew right into your hands. And you laughed even harder, when I walked in to take you back home, I saw two of our horses, dead on the ground, stab wounds all around their bodies.\"\n\nMy heart dropped and I got the chills. I noticed my wife's gaze, she was looking at me, really looking. \"You don't remember any of this?\" She asked.\n\n\"He can't.\" My mother explained.\n\nWe both looked at her with confused expressions, asking to elaborate further.\n\nShe sighed. \"We promised ourselves we'd never tell you this, but we knew this might happen if you had a child.\" \n\nFor some reason right then and there, I felt betrayed, I felt hurt. They knew? And still decided to stay silent?\n\n\"You wrote us a list of rules to follow when you were six and a half. It was a very strange list, including a lot of disturbing things written down. One of the supposed rules even described a ritual we were supposed to perform every day. And what was the consequence if we didn't follow these rules? At the bottom of the page, written in red crayon, it said: ***Boo will take***\"\n\n\"What?\" I was in disbelief. Boo will take? Take what? Me? My son? \n\n\"Of course we didn't follow those stupid rules, instead we brought you straight to a priest. However even a priest couldn't help. He had no clue what we were dealing with. It was a punch in the gut and we were ready to give up. However luckily enough we mentioned this thing to one of our close friends, and she knew exactly what to do. Make you forget. Because it seemed like all the power Boo had, was gotten from you. Because you believed he was real.\"\n\nAfter a long, silent pause, my mom continued. \"So that's what we did. That's why you can't remember.\" \n\nMy wife opened her mouth to speak, maybe ask something, but she was interrupted by a loud shout coming from our son. \"Boo!\" And then my father screaming bloody murder. We shared quick worried glances and rushed over to the room where they were playing. Tristan had a smile on his face. \"Look I scared grandpa!\" He pointed to my dad, laying on the ground, his hand clutching his chest. \n\n\"Call an ambulance!\" My mom said and my wife sprung into action. \n\n\"What happened Tristan?\" I asked him.\n\n\"I was playing with grandpa..\" His smile was gone now and he had tears welling up in his eyes.\n\n\"And then what?\" \n\n\"I wanted to scare him..\" He said. \n\n\"So you said Boo?\" \n\n\"Yeah..\"\n\n\"And he fell over because he was scared?\" Tristan nodded. I sighed. \n\nThe ambulance arrived after about 35 minutes and took him to the hospital. My mom went with him but told us to stay with our son and that she'd update us. It was a heart attack. \n\nWe put Tristan to bed and then started cleaning up the kitchen.\n\n\"Do we erase his memories too?\" My wife asked.\n\nFor some reason I really hated that idea, I really hated my childhood being taken away from me, just erased like that, and I'm sure Tristan would hate that too. But at the same time what else can we do? \n\nI shrugged. \"I don't know.\" \n\n\"Well we have to do something, before this.. thing does something to our son too.\" \n\nI nodded. \n\nWe went to sleep shortly after.\n\n\"But I don't want to.\"\n\n\"Uhuh.\"\n\n\"No he won't make you go away.\"\n\n\"He's my daddy.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\n\"No I don't want to!\"\n\nI opened my eyes groggily, I saw a small silhouette standing over me, looking at me. \n\n\"No!\" I heard Tristan's voice shout. \n\nI got up in bed. \"Tristan? What's up?\" My eyes were still adjusting to the darkness. He was clutching something in his left hand. He took a step backwards.\n\n\"I'm sorry.\" He said under his breath. \"I'm sorry.\" He repeated a little louder. \"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.\" He kept saying and saying. \"Hey, it's okay, come here.\" I motioned for him. I heard something metal clank on the ground, and realised that he dropped whatever he was holding. I noticed the glint of something metal on the ground. It was a knife. I got the chills. Tristan ran into my arms and began sobbing, still apologising. \n\nFor some reason I looked at the door of my bedroom. I saw something dark, a shadowy silhouette peering inside our room. My heart dropped. I kept looking at it, trying to examine it, but it was too dark to see. It hadn't noticed that I noticed it. I looked at Tristan for a moment, consoling him, and then back at the door. It was gone. \n\nI don't know how my wife stayed asleep during all this, but she was surprised to see Tristan in our bed in the morning. And horrified to find the knife at the foot of our bed. \n\nIt is the morning now as I'm writing this, my mother still hasn't called us. Tristan has been awfully quiet all day today, just clinging either to me or his mother. \n\nThis thing clearly tried to make Tristan murder me last night. And I am so, so, so proud of him because he didn't. \n\nWe need to make him forget, as much as I don't want to erase his childhood. I will update you all once I know more about my father's wellbeing, and once I figure out how we're erasing his memories of this so called imaginary friend.",

        "author": "NewAgeSolution",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10axfbk/the_knocking_in_the_woods/",
        "text": "I’d been living in my house for about a year before the knocking started. It didn’t happen often, probably once every 6-8 weeks. There would only be one or two knocks each time, and they always came from the woods behind my house. I never got a closeup view of what made them, and what few glances I managed were always obscured by trees or other cover. It was broadly-sized, a solid dark color, and appeared to stand upright. I nicknamed it “Whoop,” because that’s exactly how the weird call it seemed to make sounded. I definitely heard its “whooping” more often than the knocking. I’d always try to answer, but could never get another reply.\n\nNow, I’m sure what you’re thinking, and before all this happened, I never thought or knew much about things like Bigfoot, ghosts, or the paranormal—and to reiterate, I still don’t know what Whoop even is because I never got an actual clear visual. If anything like that existed, I thought it just added more mystery to this world. I came out here to live a quiet simple life. I don’t want fame, attention, or publicity, and figured Whoop wanted the same. Provided we kept our boundaries, I thought the two of us could have a peaceful coexistence.\n\nShortly after the knocks began, my garden and animal pens started getting raided at night. It only happened once every so often, but something would pillage my crops, fruit trees, even steal one or two of my farm animals. My garden and pens can keep out animals of all sizes (this was the first time I ever had problems), but since whatever was doing this still managed to slip in and out with ease, I quickly realized it was Whoop. I tried using trail cameras to catch an image of it and as a potential deterrent. It worked at first, but Whoop eventually found a way around the cameras….and if it had to, smashed or knocked them off their posts.\n\nAfter this happened a few more times, it became evident that Whoop’s nighttime visits occurred on the same days I heard the knocking. Discovering this correlation made me pay closer attention to the details of Whoop’s nocturnal marauding, which made me notice another pattern—it always either ransacked the garden or animal pens, and never did both on the same night. When I aligned the number of knocks heard each time, and which section was subsequently raided, another pattern became clear—One knock meant the garden. Two meant the pens.\n\nThe knocks, I thought, have to mean it was hungry, and whether it wanted a carnivorous or herbivorous meal. The next time I heard Whoop’s knocking, I put that theory to the test. It was a single loud knock that came around dusk, and was actually followed by a quick “whoop” about 15 minutes later. One knock should mean the garden, so I filled a bowl with fruits, vegetables, grain, nuts, and laid them out on a large flat rock about 20 yards into the tree line. I was hoping an offering like this could be my way of letting Whoop know I understood its message, and it would in turn stay out of my garden. Sure enough, it worked. I saw no signs of any disturbances in my garden the next morning, and everything I left for it on the rock was gone. This became my protocol whenever I heard the knocking, and it worked every time.\n\nThen, a few months later, my boyfriend Jessie moved in with me….and the knocking stopped. Nothing happened for about 5-6 months, and I figured Whoop must have left the area. I told Jessie about the knocking and offerings I left for Whoop. Naturally he was skeptical about it, and when nothing happened those first few months after he moved in, it was hard to not blame him for thinking I was crazy.\n\nThen, out of nowhere, the knocking resumed.\n\nI was sitting on my back patio one evening, admiring the diamond necklace Jessie surprised me with when he came home earlier that day. It had a silver chain and heart-shaped diamond charm that was light pink in color with gold edging, and glimmered wondrously in the sunset’s rays. I actually jumped upon hearing the knocking—clear as day, and coming no more than 50 feet from inside the tree line. I should have been delighted to hear a sign from Whoop, but something was oddly different about these knocks that just didn’t sit right….\n\nThis time, there were three.\n\nThree deep, hollow-sounding knocks. The first two were practically back-to-back, but the third came a few seconds later, throwing me off guard. Whoop never knocked three times before, I thought. What did three mean? Hoping to cover all the bases, I laid out a spread of fruits, vegetables, even included fish, sweets, and other random items on the offering rock. Jessie didn’t hear the knocking when it happened, but played along anyway, despite emphatically reiterating his skepticism. When I woke up the next morning, there didn’t seem to be any disturbances in the garden or pens. It looked like my offering worked….or so I thought. Upon stepping outside, I spotted something on my back patio—a large clump of knotty, thick, dark brown hair that I noticed had a streak of pink highlighting. I went to pick it up, but immediately dropped it and stumbled back into the kitchen, struggling to maintain my balance, while comprehending what I just saw….\n\nThere was more than just hair in that clump—it was an entire human scalp.\n\nI sprung into the living room to get Jessie, and spilled onto the floor upon entering. I could only frantically point towards the kitchen’s backdoor and sputter panicked gibberish until Jessie managed to calm my nerves by firmly holding me in place.\n\n“There-out-out there….the-the patio-is-some-thing….” I couldn’t even make complete sentences. “Hair…the-the-hair.”\n\nJessie looked more confused than worried. He got me onto the couch, saying he’d check it out, but wanted me to stay put until he returned. I heard Jessie open the kitchen door and step outside, where he remained for about five minutes—which to me, felt like hours. I was flooded with relief upon hearing Jessie step back inside and make his way down the hall, but he gave me an answer I didn’t expect.\n\n“There’s nothing out there….” Jessie said as he reentered the living room. “What exactly did you see?”\n\nDespite what he said, Jessie’s face had almost no color and he wore this flustered petrified expression, looking like he just saw a ghost. The worry on Jessie’s face made me feel horrible for scaring him like this, but there was no disputing what I saw.\n\n“Jessie, when I went outside, there was a clump of hair….out on the patio,” I shakily replied. “Not just hair but an entire human fucking scalp. It must have….was….placed there by….something.”\n\nI brought up calling the police, but Jessie quickly interjected.\n\n“What are you gonna tell them—the ‘thing’ that lives in the woods behind my house, put a human scalp on my back patio, then took it back….?” Jessie asked with a noticeable tinge of sarcasm. “Even if they don’t think you’re crazy, they can’t do anything without proof….and according to you—it vanished!”\n\nJessie wasn’t fond of the law, but he made a point. Despite my reluctance, I went back outside with Jessie to poke around, but found no trace of a human scalp. It was moved, I thought. There was only one animal around here that could have done it with such impeccable covertness, and if that was the case, the prospect of it being able to get that close without me knowing still keeps me up at night. When I checked the offering rock, nothing I left out was touched, which made me even more unsettled. Jessie tried convincing me I mistook it for something else, but again—I knew what I saw.\n\nJessie managed to put me down for a nap later that day. It was dusk when I woke up, and despite regaining some composure, I felt no less on edge. The house, I noticed, contained an eerie stillness. I called for Jessie, but he didn’t respond. I went downstairs and found a note from Jessie in the kitchen, saying he had to make an emergency shipment for work, and would be gone for a few days. Jessie was a truck driver, and traveled a lot, so last-minute jobs springing up like this weren’t uncommon.\n\nI tried calling his phone, but it went straight to voicemail, which also wasn’t unusual since the reception outside of town was subpar at best, and stayed like that for quite a while. Nonetheless, I was now completely alone in this house, and at a time when the last thing I wanted to be was by myself. I thought about leaving, but it was already dark, and I didn’t even feel comfortable venturing beyond my front door. Before going to bed, I made sure every light in the house was on, and any opening or entrance was closed and locked. Remarkably, the night passed without incident.\n\nAlthough the next few days were uneventful, I still couldn’t get in touch with Jessie. Whenever I called, his phone kept going to voicemail. Although he claimed not to find anything, the expression on Jessie’s face that morning said differently. I feared Jessie actually saw the severed scalp (maybe even caught a glimpse of Whoop), and was so spooked, it made him leave. Most of his belongings were still here though, and it was too uncharacteristic of him to be so unreachable, so I was assuming the worst. While trying to make sense of Jessie’s abrupt departure, I continued obsessing over Whoop’s gruesome “gift”....and a few days later, the questions I had about it were answered.\n\nThe police showed up one morning and said they had to use my backyard so they can access a crime scene in the woods behind my house. Turns out some hikers stumbled across five bodies at the bottom of a ravine about one mile away from my house. Investigators said the bodies were initially buried, but got dug up by some sort of large animal. It not only exhumed all five corpses, but apparently ate and dismembered large sections of their bodies. I was certain Whoop committed these grizzly killings, and my suspicions were confirmed after seeing a photo of one victim. Her name was Heather, and she’d been missing for about two months. She had a pretty face with gleaming green eyes, and beautiful dark brown hair….which contained a prominent pink highlight streak. That human scalp I found the other day….it belonged to that woman.\n\nBut then, the case took a different turn.\n\nDespite the body’s battered conditions, investigators managed to identify all five victims. They were mostly prostitutes, junkies, and drifters. They were all from different parts of the country and had no connections to our town or surrounding area. Autopsies revealed every one of them died by strangulation and blunt force trauma, which to me still implicated Whoop. There still had to be some sort of underlying connection explaining why these victims wound up here of all places, and I found that link when looking at the picture of another victim. When I saw it, my feet almost buckled. The necklace this woman wore in her photo—silver chain with a heart-shaped light pink diamond and gold edging— was the same one I got from Jessie.\n\nWhoop didn’t kill those people….it was Jessie.\n\nI went to the police and told them about the necklace (but didn’t say anything about the human scalp). They searched my house and found a stash of random items belonging to all five victims, which they said were probably trophies Jessie kept as mementos, likely as a way to remember the murder. I never heard from Jessie again, who’s still at large. Detectives think he could also be behind some other unsolved disappearances and murders that happened in spots along his trucking route, and are still investigating.\n\nOnce I put the pieces together, it painted a macabre picture. Jessie, my boyfriend, killed those five people. He must have encountered them along his trucking routes, and brought the bodies back here to be buried. It’s unclear if Jessie held them captive before killing them, or did it immediately and hauled their corpses around, both of which are equally disturbing scenarios. Looking back at the day Jessie left, I think he did see the human scalp and disposed of it himself after realizing it came from one of his victims. Jessie did flee, but only to avoid getting caught. Whoop was the catalyst behind his departure, but not because it was trying to protect or give me a warning.\n\nIt just wanted to eat.\n\nWhoop must have come across Jessie’s burial site on its own or following Jessie during one of his dropoffs. This also made me realize what three knocks meant—it was hungry for human meat. After eating those bodies, Whoop must have developed a taste for human flesh, and here’s why I’m certain that’s the case….One night last weekend, a solo camper went missing in the same stretch of woods behind my house. On the same evening of her disappearance….I heard three loud knocks coming from the woods.",

I did a quick run down in my mind of everything I'd seen. \"Uh yeah th-that was real,\" I stammered. How was this possible?\n\nThe squirrel was *massive* and everything about it was just… wrong. It had way more than 4 front teeth and they were shaped more like a shark's, so sharp and jagged one after another. Its claws were impossibly long and razor sharp. It was missing half of its tail with bleached white bone showing, its legs not faring any better. Its nose was missing and you could see its ribs like something had taken a chunk out of it… I didn't dare spend time thinking about what could have done that to this massive thing, I shuttered subconsciously. Its gray fur was matted heavily with a dried brown substance… blood. Most upsetting of all… it had two heads, each with its own set of monstrous horns and these beady glowing red eyes that sent chills down my spine.\n\n\"What do we do Chris?!\"\n\n\"Honestly Kyla I-I don't know. But we need to get out of here!\"\n\nSuddenly we heard the sound of skittering around the house. I have no idea how this massive thing was still agile enough to move like a normal squirrel but I didn't question it, nothing was normal about this one. We heard the upstairs window shatter. We only looked at each other briefly before it was followed by the sound of the garage door being ripped off.\n\nI nearly crapped my pants and looking at Kyla I think she felt the same. There was no time to recuperate when the back sliding glass door shattered. It was time to move! Kyla stood frozen in fear as the beast shoved its massive body through the frame leaving behind fur and tissue.\n\nI wasted no time and grabbed her by the wrist and ran. I had no direction in mind, just the hell away from there. We ended up back outside racing for the treeline. This thing was impossibly fast. It had already managed to break free of the house and was hot on our heels. We started at a full sprint.\n\nWe made it maybe a half mile zigging this way, zagging the other way. Just trying to put distance between it and us. Hoping to cause confusion by not just running a straight path. I don't know why we thought that would help considering this monster could bound from tree to tree. It had a great view of us no matter what we did. I guess because we really weren't thinking, just trying to get away somehow. \n\nWe managed to dodge all the branches that fell from above, barely being hit a few times. We could hear that it was still gaining on us and our tanks were near empty. I glanced at Kyla knowing she was tired but willing her to keep pushing forward. We had to break free of the woods soon. Shouldn't we? I felt a new panic rise inside me… we should have at least reached the river by now. How much did we really zig and zag?! \n\nKyla must have sensed it because she looked back and had the same look of panic. \"Chris, where are we?!\" She panted out between heavy breaths. I so badly wanted to tell her everything would be okay, that I knew exactly where we were but I just couldn't. I tried to think of any words of encouragement or anything positive in this impossible situation but I could only come up with a meager, \"We're getting closer to the river it should be right up there, just keep going!\" I knew these words were a lie but I had to keep her going. And that's when it happened.. \n\nKyla tripped… I stopped in my tracks and turned around to try and grab her but it was too late. The beast dropped from the trees and grabbed her in its claws. When the hell had it gotten so close?!\n\nI stood there in shock, I wanted to save her but she yelled, \"Go Chris, it's too late… RUN!\" And I'm so ashamed to say that I did. I left her there. Her screams will haunt me until the day I die. I was stupid enough to look back and saw the beast raise her to its heads and they fought each other over her body. \n\nI can't believe I just left her like that. I feel like such a coward but that was the type of person Kyla was. She would always sacrifice herself to put others first. Another reason I loved her so much. It made my heart ache and my stomach ache but I ran anyway. \n\nI ran as fast as I could, as far as I could hoping that maybe Kyla was a big enough meal that I had time to get away. I'm so stupid! I was in such a frenzy to get away that I managed to get lost even deeper in my *own* woods. I'm hunkered down by this fallen tree praying that it won't be able to sniff me out. I've tried calling the police over and over but I only have one bar of service and it won't connect. I don't know what to do. I'm so scared.\n\nI hoped maybe if someone got this message they would be able to find me, call the police something! But I feel that this is just going to be my final words.\n\nI hear it coming… it's in the trees, the branches are snapping and leaves are falling everywhere. I hear it coming from two different directions.. I looked up and this time, a little urine did escape… There were 8 sets of red beady eyes staring down at me… 4 to my left and 4 to my right.\n\nIf you do get this message please tell Kyla's family I'm so sorry…",

He wears a white cotton button-down shirt underneath a beige argyle vest, on his nose rests a pair of discrete metal-frame glasses, they give him an almost bookish quality. There is a half-attempt to style his remaining hair, slicked backwards behind his ears. The hairline has long receded, exposing a smooth and unwrinkled forehead. The wiry pencil moustache that sits above his downturned upper lip is, perhaps, the only distinct expression of identity that Mr Ellis possesses. This presentation stands in stark contrast to the crimes of which he is accused.\n\nEllis is better known to the general public by his username, from the social-platform chatVirtual and online forum AnonBoard, *Godhead*.\n\nHis demeanour suggests an indifference to my visit. To him, I suppose I’m picking at the bones, another scavenger looking for headline fodder. But I truly am intrigued. How does grey Mr D. Ellis become a spiritual leader for thousands of disillusioned men and women around the world? Where does Mr Ellis stop and Godhead begin?\n\nTaking my pen from the inside pocket of my jacket, I click it once to say, *let’s begin.*\n\n“I’d like to start from the beginning, is that okay?” I place a tape recorder on the table, another gesture of my intent.\n\nHe speaks. “Sure, why not. How far back would you like to go?”\n\nD. Ellis was born, a month and a half premature, in Buntonbury on the Water. By his own account, his childhood was uneventful. He grew up playing in nature. He attended a local primary and then secondary school. He had friends, some that he liked more than others. His parents were loving but busy. As he grew into his teenage years, he quickly realised his physique was best suited to activities of the intellectual variety. He took an interest in maths, philosophy and computer science, and at the age of 18, left home to go to university.\n\nI wonder “Did you ever find any of it dull?”\n\nHe curls the fingers in his left hand and places the index against his cheekbone, then furrows his brow in recollection. “If it were dull, I don’t think I’d ever’ve realised. It was all I ever had.”\n\nLeaving Buntonbury, Ellis studied Computer Science and Philosophy at Illcester. It was there that he first read Timothy Leary and Eight-circuit model of consciousness, John C. Lilly's Programming and Metaprogramming in the Human Biocomputer.\n\n\"Did you find it easier to think of the human brain in terms of computers?\" I say.\n\n\"The brain *is* a computer\" he responds, without a hint of doubt.\n\nInspired by his academic heroes, he began to experiment with psychedelics, eventually dropping out of his studies and pursuing an alternative lifestyle full-time. When he describes these years, the edges of his thin moustache creep upward ever so slightly, his lips forming a suggestion of a smile. I’m intrigued. “Was that a period of time you are particularly fond of?”\n\n“Oh, yes. I learned a lot about myself, what I was capable of. But, I also learned about people. How they are. How they behave. And all of this, of course” He gestures around, and somehow beyond, the room in which we are sitting.\n\nFor nearly one hour, Ellis has been describing his youth as if it were an object, quite some distance away, and he was struggling to get a hold of it. He is now present. I'm seeing more of the character I’ve heard about. I do not want to waste the moment.\n\n“Okay then, David. How do we get from tuned-in Illcester dropped-out spiritual leader, Godhead?”\n\nFor a second, I worry I’ve pushed too much, too soon *—* patience and flattery are essential when talking to personalities like Ellis. He turns his face downwards and his hands fall to rest on the table between us. After a pause, he brings his head back up to me. No more soft gaze. His eyes are trained on mine. He is in complete focus.\n\n“I’m afraid I must answer your question with another.” He pauses, waiting for my consent and I nod. “What would you say to me, if I told you that where we are, here, is an illusion? That, You and I, we were never really Here, to begin with.”\n\nThere is something rather trustworthy and safe in his lack of charisma. He speaks with great certainty and authority, and in a calm, deliberate manner. He slows the conversation back down, and we jump back and forth between his biography and his theories of the world. The nature of our holographic universe, his mother's funeral, the many layers of our reality, and how through the mindful use of psychedelics and strict meditation, one might a take peek at what lies beyond. Of course, he is in control of these conversations, steering our dialogue left and right whenever it suits him.\n\nThen, without warning, he leans closer. A sharp note now dominates his previously scholarly inflexion. “Shall I tell you what I did to them?”\n\n“Please, go ahead.”\n\n“Very well” he replies and manages to bring himself even closer, our cheeks parallel, almost touching. “Why, nothing at all.”\n\nHe slides back in his chair and smoothes out a wrinkle in his shirt. His upper lip making the hint of a smile.\n\n“I simply showed them the truth. Then, when it was forcibly taken from them, I showed them how they could get back to the truth, *for ever*.”\n\nVaguely, and for the first time in our conversation, Mr David Ellis has acknowledged the ongoing case in which he is embroiled. He has been described by some as the metaverse’s Manson, a 21st-century fusion of Hubbard and Jones. I ask him what he thinks of these comparisons\n\n“Ludicrous, of course. Undressed, those men were simply charlatans, twisting reality to corrupt the minds of the vulnerable. Binding and poisoning their flock when they felt their slackening grasp. My mission has always been to *free*, *to enlighten.*”\n\n\\--\n\nHe has spoken of freedom and enlightenment throughout our conversation, of transcendence. But in our world at least, he is a dangerous cult leader. Under the guise of offering a path to spiritual enlightenment, Mr Ellis, AKA Godhead, lured thousands of individuals into a virtual world where they were subjected to a variety of mind-altering techniques, including the use of psychedelic drugs.\n\nThe cult, which operated primarily on the VR hangout ‘chatVirtual’, promised its members access to a higher plane of existence, but in reality, it was a tool for Mr Ellis to exert a dangerous level of control over his followers. \n\nMany members became dependent on the virtual world, withdrawing from their real lives and neglecting their physical and mental health. \n\nEllis' virtual world became a place of escape for many of its users, a place of solace from the reality of their lives. They were drawn in by its promise of limitless possibilities, of a new and exciting world far from their own. They were captivated by Ellis and his promise of an existence free from suffering and pain. Many of the users became dependent on this virtual world, shuttering themselves away from their real lives and neglecting their needs. As their physical health deteriorated, their mental health began to decline as well. When authorities began to intervene, Ellis explained to his followers that there was only one way to remain in the higher plane without interference.\n\nSoon, the authorities began to find bodies, lifeless and connected to VR systems —  some emaciated to the point of skeletal remains due to starvation, others wizened and mummified from dehydration, and still others with bloated faces and bulging eyes, the result of exhaustion. All of the bodies were found connected to VR systems, their hands still clutching the controllers, desperate to continue. \n\nEllis had encouraged his followers to take their own lives, telling them that it was the only way to stay in the virtual world. In only a matter of weeks, hundreds of people had been seduced into sacrificing their lives for a false promise of eternal escape, their lives taken by their own hands at the behest of their leader.\n\n\\--\n\nI try to express some of this to him, however, before I can speak I am interrupted. Mr Ellis wishes to continue his monologue.\n\n“Some people are incapable of comprehending. They are too subscribed to their inconsequential reality, willingly blinkered, with no desire to look beyond.” He gestures around the room again. “I find it sad, in fact, I struggle to understand these people at all. I can’t imagine being so tied to such a piteous fiction.” He spits out the last two words like rotten fruit. It is perhaps the most I have seen him emote within the two hours we’ve spent together.  \n\n“But *you* chose to remain here, in this ‘piteous fiction’. You abandoned your flock.”\n\nHe looks across the table, and quotes, now with the voice of a preacher, some old poem. “‘Let not the shepherd too closely cling, to one lamb fair, for spring doth bring, a new flock to tend and care.’”\n\n\"You think you're so smart,\" I say, regretting it almost immediately.\n\nI had slowly been trying to pry him open, and now, as my finger slips, he snaps shut.\n\nResigning, lounging against the crest of his plastic chair. He flattens another crease from his shirt, asking if I'd like to talk about something else, but I have heard enough.\n\n\\--\n\nMr D Ellis is inexplicably out on bail and awaiting trial for his role as the leader of the dangerous virtual reality cult known as \"The Eighth Circuit\", in spite of the overwhelming evidence against him, including testimony from former members.\n\nThe case against Mr Ellis has brought to light the dangers of unregulated virtual reality software and technology and the potential for abuse by those in positions of power. The company behind the VR technology 'Journey' and the software 'chatVirtual' used by the cult, has issued a statement expressing their concern over the event and their commitment to creating a safe and responsible virtual reality experience for every user. They have taken steps to review and improve their security measures to ensure that 'Journey' and 'chatVirtual' can only be used for their intended purpose.\n\nWhile the victims of The Eighth Circuit, many of whom have suffered irreparable harm, are still struggling to come to terms with their experiences and the betrayal of trust, the legal proceedings against Mr Ellis and his associates continue.\n\n*Article by: Emmett Morris*\n\n*17 December 2012 — 5:00 pm GMT*\n\nClick **here** to stay up to date with all developments related to this article.\n\nOr alternatively, try out our quiz ***Which Famous Cult Leader Are You?***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n—————————————————\n\n**Comments**:\n\n*(Please note the comment section will be closed and archived after 24 hours)*\n\n—————————————————\n\nTrueEnglish88 - 12/17/22:\n\n289 Thumbs Up\n\n··· Bring back the rope!! 💀\n\n—————————————————\n\nFuzzy\\_Unicorn - 12/17/22:\n\n32 Thumbs Up\n\n··· #FREEGODHEAD\n\n—————————————————\n\nSpartacus33 - 12/17/22:\n\n183 Thumbs Up\n\n··· This article brings back a lot of painful memories, I was raised in a cult.

        "text": "This happened in 2019. I had always been an avid hiker, and when I heard about the beautiful trails in the Swiss Alps, I knew I had to go. So, I packed my bags and set off on my adventure.\n\nThe first few days were amazing. The views were breathtaking, and I felt like I was in a postcard. I had the trails all to myself, and I was loving every minute of it. But as I was hiking deeper into the mountains, I started to feel like I was being followed. The trail was deserted, and I had not seen any other hikers for hours, but I couldn't shake the feeling that someone was watching me. I kept turning around to see if anyone was behind me, but there was never anyone there.\n\nI tried to tell myself that it was just my imagination playing tricks on me, but the feeling persisted. I started to feel paranoid and anxious, my heart racing with fear. I was so focused on the feeling of being followed that I didn't even notice the beauty of the mountains anymore.\n\nThe feeling became even stronger as the day went on, and I started to hear strange noises behind me. At first, I thought it was just the wind, but as I turned around, I saw something that made my blood run cold. There, standing on the trail behind me, were three creatures. They were unlike anything I had ever seen before. They were tall and thin, with elongated limbs and heads that seemed too large for their bodies. Their skin was a sickly gray color, and their eyes were black and soulless.\n\nI froze, unsure of what to do. The creatures just stood there, staring at me. I pulled my phone out to take a picture of them, but as soon as I did, they started running towards my and it made me panic. I lost my balance, fell on the ground, losing my phone in the process. I knew I had to get away FAST, so I got up and started running as fast as I could.\n\nI ran for what felt like hours, but I couldn't shake them. Every time I looked back over my shoulder, I saw that the creatures were following me. \n\nThey were always there, just behind me, their elongated limbs allowing them to keep pace with ease. I was terrified and I didn't know what to do. \n\nAfter a while, I stumbled upon what looked like an abandoned bunker deep in the mountains. I had heard that there were many bunkers made by the Swiss army in the Alps, but I never thought I would find one. I pushed open the rusty door, and as soon as I stepped inside, chills went down my spine. The walls were covered in carvings depicting the same creatures that were following me. I knew that I was not the first person to see these creatures. A tunnel went further into the mountain, but it was pitch black inside of it and I decided to stay within the first room. Old planks and empty beer cans were scattered on the floor.\n\nI barricaded the door and huddled in a corner, trying to catch my breath. But I could still hear them outside, rustling in the bushes. I peeked out a small opening in the wall and saw that they were hiding behind the trees, watching the bunker. They would occasionally poke their heads out, their black eyes staring at me. This went on for the whole night, and I was too scared to sleep.\n\nIn the morning, the creatures were still there, lurking outside the bunker. I knew that I couldn't stay there forever, so I decided to explore deeper into the bunker. I walked down the dark and damp corridor, feeling my way with my hands, touching the walls and using an old rotten broom as my guide. As I walked, I felt as if someone was watching me, but I knew it couldn't have been the creatures as I would probably have heard them destroy the barricaded door of the bunker.\n\nI finally reached the end of the corridor and opened the door to a large room. Inside, I felt something hanging on my right, I couldn't quite tell what it was, could be clothes, maybe an uniform, or old rags, but I felt a metal helmet, it was clearly a helmet. And on my left, I felt a machine, I couldn't tell what it was, but I heard a soft humming noise coming from it. I reached out blindly, trying to find the source of the noise, and my hand landed on a switch. I flipped it on, and the machine came to life.\n\nSuddenly, the room was flooded with light and it blinded me for a second. I could see that this room also had carvings against the walls, just like the ones I had seen previously. Even though the room looked odd and creepy, the fact that it wasn't pitch black anymore was somewhat relieving. \n\nThere was a greenish door leading further into the bunker, and I noticed that the machine also triggered lights in the corridor that led me to this room. I turned around and got scared for a second when I saw the old army uniform, hanging on the wall. It looked damp and moldy, as if it had been here for decades. \n\nI was starting to feel lightheaded, which was probably normal. After all I hadn't slept for over a day and the only food I had eaten was a local chocolate coated wafer bar and a small sausage. I didn’t pack a lot of food as there were small villages or rest stops everywhere in the Alps, and I had plans to sleep at a hotel the night prior. I was wondering if they tried to contact me, or alerted the authorities ? Maybe a search party was looking for me. But there was no way they would find me in this bunker. I sat down on the ground and leaned against the wall, trying to gather my thoughts and come up with a plan. \n\nAs I sat there, I noticed a shadow on the wall, coming from the entrance corridor. At first, I thought I was hallucinating, but no, I wasn’t. It was moving. It was them. The creatures that had been following me were now inside the bunker. I quickly got up and slammed the door shut, which luckily could be closed from the inside. As soon as I did, I heard them rushing towards the door. I turned to the other door, but it was locked.\n\nI was trapped, with the creatures closing in on me. I could hear them scratching at the door, their elongated limbs reaching through the cracks. I remember thinking “This is it. This is how I die.”\n\nI knew that I was going to die there, alone in that bunker, in a foreign country.\n\nBut then, I remembered the old Swiss army uniform hanging on the mannequin. For some reason, my survival instincts kept making me look at that uniform. Was it because uniforms have a sense of authority? Was it because of its rotten smell? Was I going crazy? I don't know.\n\nI quickly put it on and grabbed the helmet, hoping it would give me some protection if the creatures attacked me. The creatures broke through the door, and I braced myself for the worst. But as they approached me, they suddenly stopped. They stared at me for a moment, then turned and fled back into the wilderness, as if they were scared.\n\nI never found out why they didn't attack me, but I was just glad to be alive. I quickly made my way back to civilization, but until today I never spoke of the creatures I had encountered. I knew no one would believe me anyway, and I didn't want to be known as the crazy hiker who claimed to have been followed by monsters in the mountains.",

        "text": "My five-year-old daughter Clara reminds me of my grandmother, La Nona, who was most certainly a witch.\n\nStrange things would inexplicably happen around La Nona. Entire shelves in supermarkets would unhinge and crash jars to the floor, and people around her would occasionally slip like in the cartoons, their legs straight up in the air as if tackled by an invisible linebacker.\n\nAny time something strange like that would happen, La Nona would look at us and laugh softly with her raspy breath.\n\n\"Ho, ho, ho.\"\n\nKind of like Santa but with a soft Italian O and a barely audible, breathy H.\n\nAnd like any other Italian grandmother, she cooked throughout the day, hunched over her stock or stew or braise, breathing in the vapors and adding pinches and dashes from her unlabeled spice rack. Wild rabbits were not safe from her, and some said even the squirrels and chipmunks would wind up in her stews. \n\nWhen we had company, La Nona would announce the dishes halfway through the meal, and she would relish as the American's faces turned and grimaced at stuffed pigeon, braised rabbit, cow tongue, cow brain. But she did it that way really to entertain herself.\n\nWe would catch her sometimes scratching her back with a wooden cooking spoon and she'd laugh.\n\n\"Ho, ho, ho. It adds flavor. And it protects.\"\n\nShe would never elaborate beyond that.\n\nSo as I said, my daughter Clara reminded me of La Nona. Starting at age three, small toys would fall off the shelves or a fresh pyramid of stacked oranges would collapse and jumble through the aisles like racecars, and customers would fumble through the mess, slipping like in the cartoons, and Clara would just smile and do a little laugh under her breath, just like La Nona.\n\n\"Hmm, hmm, hmm.\" \n\nShe would say it in a sing-song pre-school sort of way, and if I were to shoot her a glance throughout any of this, she would follow-up with her way-too-loud toddler voice.\n\n\"It washn't me!\"\n\nOne time when she was four, we lost track of Clara at the Lego store in the mall. After several panicked moments, we had the whole store staff and mall security involved. And just as we were about to call the police to report a child kidnapping, I felt a tug at my pant leg.\n\n\"I wash here da whole time. Just invishible,\" she announced triumphantly.\n\nThe mall cops, the store staff, and the mall pedestrians that has joined in on the search were collectively shocked at how she had snuck up on us all.\n\n\"Where did you go?\" I remember crying, still terrified and shaking with adrenaline.\n\n\"Hmm, hmm, hmm,\" she had responded.\n\nThe head of mall security, having been searching with me for most of the time, was so perplexed that he subsequently reviewed the video feeds and for the life of him could not find a single trace of Clara from her disappearance up until she had reappeared.\n\nHe had called me, with a grave tone, explaining his findings. I had nothing more to offer other than half-joking that some say my family has a line of witches, and he turned even more serious and said he had a Hessian great aunt who the town believed was a witch, and that I shouldn't joke about such things.\n\nLa Nona passed away at age 90 peacefully in her sleep. A whole flock of birds had gathered in front of the house and as the ambulance wheeled her out the front door, the birds erupted in song, creating a pandemonium that took twenty minutes to dissipate, and the block was talking about the avian gathering for months after, and the story would be retold any time La Nona came up in conversation, which was whenever something strange occured in the town.\n\nWhen they buried La Nona, the priest fell into a tongue-tie throughout the eulogy (he later stated it felt like all the words were coming to him thick and jumbled, like jello) and the mechanism that lowered the coffin into the grave failed, leaving La Nona above ground throughout the night after mortuary technicians were unable to resolve the jam.\n\nLocal legends developed that some had seen La Nona wandering the streets that night, chuckling “Ho, ho, ho,” as she shambled by, but I never believed that part of it and firmly believe she is at peace within the earth.\n\n*\n\nI was washing dishes after dinner while Clara ate strawberries in front of the television in the family room. The cartoons were rolling but at some point it transitioned to evening news and I didn’t think much of it, especially when the opening segment was on dog and cat ownership tips and we had been considering getting a cat. \n\nI heard Clara yell out \"Awww, I want that one! No, that one!\" throughout the segment and I chuckled to myself.\n\nNormally I would ask her if she wanted to go to the park really quick before bath time, but the new curfew had mucked that idea up. It was, after all, a full moon.\n\nWe had just moved to a new two-story townhouse, with the kitchen and family room on the first floor, and bedrooms on the second. We were right across the street from the town's new sports complex that boasted three fields (soccer, football, and baseball, each outfitted with modern scoreboards and bleachers with an announcer's room), a full toddler/older kid playground, a dog park (for both small and large dogs), and even a snack shack where Clara always begged me for fries or a corn dog while we watched the games.\n\n\"Daddy, can I watch the games from my room tonight?\"\n\n\"Sorry, the games were canceled tonight. Maybe tomorrow's games.\"\n\nIt was true, we did have a view of all three fields and at night when they were all lit up we could see all the action from the window. It was like our own box seats and I would sometimes make popcorn or bring up some pirates booty.\n\n\"And tomorrow morning we can go to the forest park,\" she added.\n\n\"Sure thing. As long as you get ready for school early enough.\"\n\nThe forest park was the park we used to go to before the new complex. It was a five minute walk through a forest path that was bordered by fenced-in backyards, and eventually opened up into a large clearing surrounded by trees with various other paths emptying into suburban streets.\n\nThe news suddenly jarred to a new development in the Full Moon Serial Killer murders, and I frantically searched for the remote.\n\n“Another full moon tonight and yet another victim claimed by the Full Moon Serial Killer,\" said the news anchor. \"This marks victim number six in what is being called the worst spree in this state's history.\"\n\nI finally found the remote and shut it off. \n\n\"OK kiddo, time for bath, then books.\"\n\nI had heard enough of the Full Moon Serial Killer, or FMSK for short. It was all you would hear buzzing about as you waited in line at the bagel shop, or dropped the kids off at school, or withdrew money at the bank.\n\nThe FMSK. The MO remained the same: a single, one to one-and-a-half inch pierce to the jugular, where the victims bleed out before they are able to find help. Always on the night of a full moon. \nIt was why the town had set up the curfew on full moon nights, and cops and the neighborhood watch were posted every few blocks. But there were always folks that worked late and took the bus back or had partied too hard at an after-work happy hour, or just plain forgot it was the night of a full moon.\n\n\"They were talking about the mean moon man,\" said Clara, getting up from the couch and making her way upstairs.\n\n\"Uhm, yes they were. But don't worry about that. We are safe at home and no one will hurt us here.\"\n\nI hated how the FMSK culture had permeated, even being discussed actively at school.\n\nEither way, Clara seemed satisfied with that and we moved to finish the night with a bit more cartoons, which I liked to watch with her in bed on a tablet she always insisted she hold.\n\nI dozed off briefly in the middle of an episode and then thought I heard whispering. I opened my left eye and saw Clara muttering something under her breath. \n\n\"You OK, sweetheart?\"\n\nShe stopped.\n\n\"Don't worry, Daddy. I'm just casting a spell.\"\n\n\"Oh. OK.\" I sat up and looked at the time. \"I hope a good one.\"\n\nClara smiled. \"It's just the jello spell.\"\n\n\"Oh, wonderful.\" I blinked a few more tjmes. \"Well, it's late. Let's get to bed, lovey.\"\n\nI shut off the lights and checked the locks to the doors and windows.\n\nAs I headed back up to my bedroom, I called out softly.\n\n\"Goodnight, Clara.\"\n\n\"Goodnight, Daddy. And don't worry.\"\n\n\"I won't.\"\n\n\"The jello spell protects.\"\n\nI looked back.\n\n\"Just make it a good flavor,\" I said.\n\nClara giggled softly.\n\n*\n\nI was up early at 5:45am to get myself ready for work and pack Clara's school stuff. I put on the morning news and again they were harping on the Full Moon Serial Killer, and for the first time they flashed a police sketch, a man with jet black hair, wearing a black face-mask and a gray suit jacket with an open white-collar shirt.\n\n\"–and many of Detective Javier's theories, along with the murder weapon, have been confirmed.\"\n\nThe kitchen knife.\n\n\"The FMSK's attire, dressing as an office worker commuting in from the city bus, and talking into his phone about business related matters, puts the victim on low alert and allows the attack of opportunity–\"\n\nA single stab wound in the neck from a kitchen knife.\n\n\"–a single stab wound in the–\"\n\nI wanted to cover my eyes because I couldn't look away from the face. I was entranced. In the dark eyes of the police sketch, there was hatred, and I could envision the rest of his expression behind the mask, sneering in disgust.\n\n\"And once again, the victim Aaron Carson, originally thought deceased, is no longer in critical condition. The first miss by the FMSK.\"\n\nThe segment cut to the FMSK lead detective, a local man named Javier Dauchez, who was at a podium speaking to the public but I was fed up and shut off the television with a deep sigh.\n\n\"They were talking about the mean moon man again.\"\n\nClara had once again scared the shit out of me, always an early riser and like a ninja with her padded rainbow leopard onesies.\n\nMean moon man. For her it was MMM.\n\n\"Never mind that,\" I said, fumbling around with her lunch box.\n\n\"Can we go to the forest park? Look Daddy, I'm dressed for school, hair combed and all.\"\n\n\"Sure, sweetheart.\"\n\nAfter we ate, we exited our town home into the cool, crisp morning, skipped across the sports complex, and trudged uphill through the forest path to get us to the forest park. It was so early that the sun was just rising, and most of the surrounding suburban homes still had their lights off.\n\nAs soon as we reached the clearing, Clara dashed ahead. There was a low mist a few inches high off the ground.\n\n\"Look Daddy, the moon!\"\n\nShe was right, it was one of those morning moons that showed fiercly in the twilight, eerily visible given it was still full from the night before. And of course there I was thinking about the Full Moon Serial Killer once again. FMSK. Or MMM. Whatever. But I had spooked myself and panned across the surrounding treeline before stepping further into the clearing. \n\nClara twirled several times with her arms elegantly keeping her balanced and she cackled up at the moon. As she maintained her continuous twirl, the mist around her feet started to quiver and swirl, exposing rustling clover flowers, and it was almost as if the morning dew drops were vibrating and levitating off the blades of grass. The mist suddenly held still and the dew twinkled like diamonds frozen in the air, and I shook my head and had to do a double take but the visage remained.\n\n\"Daddy come here. I want to tell you something.\"\n\nShe had stopped twirling and all was at once back to normal, the low mist even thicker than before. I shivered. Something was not right.\n\n\"Sure thing, what's up kiddo?\"\n\n\"I don't want you to be scared.\"\n\n\"Oh sweetheart, I'm not scared. Are–are you?\"\n\nI looked back over my shoulder at the path. Nothing but mist.\n\n\"No,\" she said. \"I'm not scared.\"\n\n\"Ok. Good.\"\n\nI took Clara's hand.\n\n\"Now let's get you to school before–\"\n\nI was about to turn back to the path, but that's when I saw the fully suited, masked man charging at full sprint from the opposite treeline, having already closed a third of the distance to us, his arms violently pumping with each stride, and he was holding a blade, glimmering and slicing through the mist.\n\n\"Oh shit–\"\n\n\"Run that way,\" said Clara, pointing to our right.\n\nI was in such disbelief that my animal brain listened. Flight.\n\nI grabbed Clara and ran in the direction she had pointed, and as we got closer to the path entrance we saw a biker coming down toward us.\n\n\"Help!\" I shouted, not looking back, the need to just get away from the mean moon man the most urgent plan of action.\n\nMMM.\n\nThe biker stopped and looked up at us, then peered over my shoulder and panicked. His hands shot to his fanny pack, he missed the zipper on the first go, then finally got it open and pulled out his cell phone, and in the half second he had to unlock it with his thumbprint, he glanced up again over my shoulder again and fumbled the phone with a yelp.\n\nI turned and the FMSK had closed the distance to only thirty paces and he was so close I could hear the blade swiping, his eyes focused and burning with hate, his breathing heavy and animalistic.\n\nI ran past cyclist and yelled \"Come on!\" but he finally had a grip on his phone and had dialed 911, and his opposite hand pulled out a small can of pepper spray.\n\n\"Stay away!\" screamed the biker in a shrill voice, and at the same time from the nearest home a man wearing his morning robe had come out of his backyard sliding door.\n\n\"Holy hell,\" the robed man exclaimed and he grabbed a bat that had been leaning again the porch.\n\nOnly then did the Full Moon Serial Killer appear dettered. Without breaking stride, he growled \"fuck\" and seamlessly changed course, vaulting over the fence nearest to him into a neighboring yard, where we lost sight of him amongst the bushes.\n\nThe cyclist was now talking to the police and the robed man asked if we were ok, his bat half cocked and scanning the path. I just held Clara tightly with white, shaking knuckles.\n\n\"I told you not to be afraid,\" she whispered. We embraced, my eyes never leaving the trees until the cops arrived.\n\nEven in the cop car, I envisioned that lunatic vaulting a guard rail and smashing through the window with his inhuman speed. \n\nOnly in the precinct with the detectives where I first met Javier Dauchez did I feel safe.\n\n*\n\nWe were back at home by late afternoon and Clara was taking an early bath. I was emotionally exhausted. Detective Javier and the police were downstairs in the living room finalizing security arrangements.\n\nClara was blowing bubbles, and they gently rose to the bathroom ceiling as I prepared her towels.\n\n\"OK, Clara, just a few more minutes then you can watch cartoons before bed.\"\n\n\"OK, Daddy.\"\n\nI paused. She seemed totally fine since the incident at the park. It had been me that couldn't stop shaking.\n\nClara turned to me, blowing a new bubble with slower breath that built into a small sphere. She seemed to carefully consider something.\n\n\"He is running out of time.\"\n\nI thought initially she was just playing with her bath toys.\n\n\"When the moon starts to rise and it's not full, he will be out of time.\"\n\nHer words felt icy and I felt the urge to shiver, to shake out what she had just said.\n\n\"No, don't say that,\" I said.\n\nThe bubble she was blowing had grown to the size of a softball and had still not popped or left the plastic blower.\n\n\"Sorry,\" she said.\n\n\"No, no, it's ok. Everyone is just tired.\" I tried to smile but it felt like a grimace.\n\n\"We're safe now. Here at home,\" I added, though I think I said it because I needed to hear it.\n\n\"Yes, Daddy. We are safe,\" she said, then added her little laugh. \"Hmm, hmm, hmm.\"\n\nMy smile relaxed. \n\n\"Five more minutes, kiddo.\"\n\nAs I exited the bathroom, I took a peek into the mirror and saw the bubble had grown to the size of a soccer ball, and I shook away the feeling that it was starting to develop a face.\n\n*\n\nI put Clara in front of the TV upstairs and looked out the window to the sports complex, not a single soul out there save a few police cars and some plain-clothes officers Javier had indicated would be patrolling the area by foot. \n\nI peered down and envisioned the sneering killer scaling the wall and brought myself some comfort in seeing nothing of the sort and also concluding there was no way to grip the siding. \n\nClara's words rang in my head. \"When the moon starts to rise and it's not full, he will be out of time.\"\n\nI glanced at my phone. Twenty seven minutes until sunset. The moon wouldn't be out in the sky quite yet but technically wouldn't it be considered rising at sunset? And the last attack had happened during the day with apparent urgency.\n\nDetective Javier had asked me to talk things over, and we sat in the living room, silent at first, as he knew I had been through a lot recounting our story over several hours. \n\nHis voice had a practiced reassurance from talking to countless victims and he had a slight French accent that calmed me. Was he tapping into my childhood pink panther days?\n\n\"What I'm about to tell you breaks decades-long professionalism, something I would never do with a member of the public,\" he said gravely. \"But it feels necessary for me to tell you. I feel… compelled.\"\n\nI nodded. Interesting word choice. The FMSK's police sketch, and then his actual masked face, compelled itself into my brain every waking moment. A constant reminder of the rage.\n\n\"The latest victim, the one that is still in recovery at the hospital, Aaron Carson.\" His R's rolled in his throat.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said. Aaron Carson, the sixth victim that FMSK had botched.\n\n\"It probably is on the news now or soon will be, but last night right before he attacked you, there was another attempt on Mr. Carson's life.\"\n\n\"Wait, he broke into the hospital?\" I was shocked.\n\nJavier nodded seriously, checking his watch briefly. Was he tracking sunset too? I shifted my weight uncomfortably and leaned closer, staring uneasily at the front door.\n\n\"The attempt was ultimately unsuccessful, as the ICU is behind a steel door supported by a steel frame,\" he continued, \"But what bothers me, it's that FMSK got in completely undetected until he got to that last door, and then that the madman actually almost broke it down.\"\n\nI gulped. He is running out of time. I checked my phone and Javier's eyes followed mine. 22 minutes to sunset.\n\n\"Steel frame. Not even two men with battering rams could have bent that door to what it was in that amount of time.\"\n\nJavier rubbed his eyes, and his voice grew even more somber.\n\n\"And I spent three hours last night reviewing hospital camera footage with our department video experts. And there were several anomalies in the footage. Various corridor shots suddenly become distorted, and the distortion moves and follows a path.\"\n\nJavier took out his phone.\n\n\"Then this. And again I apologize but I am compelled to show this.\"\n\nThere was that word again. Compelled.\n\nHe swiped open an app and I saw the hospital door to the victims' recovery ward, thick and surrounded by the steel frame.\n\nThen the visual distortion kicked in, the screen buzzing and bending, like how they used to block pay-per-view channels until you paid.\n\nThen, I heard the bangs. Rhythmic and grainy from the distortion, but powerful and loud. Occasionally the distortion would break on the borders of the video, and I saw the steel frame bend further and further, but only an inch at a time, and then after repeated attempts, the dark distorted voice kicked in, thick with spite.\n\n\"Fuck.\" Bang. \n\n\"Fuck.\" Bang. \n\n\"FUCK.\" Bang.\n\nJavier swiped it away, as if he couldn't bear it any longer. \n\n\"He stopped when security caught on something was happening. And the distortion trail goes back out from where it came.\"\n\nEighteen minutes until sundown.\n\n\"Now, you would think it ends there, but it doesn't.\"\n\nJavier swiped his phone a few more times.\n\n\"We were able to get doorbell cam footage from a house across the street from the back side of the hospital. Look.\"\n\nThe view showed the hospital in the background and an active street in the foreground. It took me a few seconds and Javier's guiding finger to see it.\n\nRight next to a tree in the background, facing the hospital backdoor, was a suited figure. He was suspended at least two feet in the air, quivering and twitching, arms stretched out into a T.\n\n\"An optical illusion you are thinking,\" said Javier. \"Poor video quality.\"\n\n\"No,\" I said. \n\nFifteen minutes to sundown. He is running out of time.\n\nThe hovering figure suddenly stopped moving, then waved his arm once as if wiping a blackboard. \n\nAnd the video distorted.\n\n\"The timing of that. Exactly right when the hospital distortion started.\"\n\nI stared blankly at the jagged bends.\n\n\"Now here is the kicker and why I have told all of this to you,\" Javier said. His eyes suddenly twinkled and he began to slowly smile.\n\nI fidgeted some more and there I was once again–compelled to look at the front door, and then up the stairs where Clara was watching TV and I hoped we could make it out of this alive. Why was I even thinking that way?\n\n\"The video experts that helped me with this review mentioned they had not seen such a perplexing set of footage since a particular mall incident.\"\n\nThat got my attention.\n\n\"A mall incident where the head of security asked the police force to help trace how a child could go missing a full twenty-two minutes and then suddenly appear from behind her father.\"\n\nJavier stared at me with fire in his eyes.\n\n\"Do you know the conclusion of that mall footage review?\"\n\nI shook my head and felt my breathing heavy. Javier simply smiled.\n\n\"The conclusion was that it was an impossibility. No amount of sneaking and jumping behind garbage cans or adult legs could explain it.\" Javier's expression warmed. \"They would never put it in a report, the report said inconclusive. But their own words were that it might as well have been magic.\"\n\nI involuntarily gasped.\n\n\"I–\" I started but then stopped myself.\n\n\"It's a lot to take in, I agree,\" said Javier, glancing again at his watch. \"And I've seen things in the last 24 hours that challenge everything I have ever believed. But it explains a lot. How there's never any footage of FMSK. How there's never a sign of struggle. And have you ever seen a knife attack?\"\n\nI shook my head. Eleven minutes. A new moon for the mean moon man was coming.\n\n\"Never one stab. Never. Always multiple stabs and slashes. No one has that kind of precision or luck.\"\n\nI felt a panic attack coming on.\n\n\"No one.\"\n\nTen minutes.\n\n\"I feel you are in grave danger…\"\n\nHe is running out of time.\n\nWe both suddenly became acutely aware of the front door, as if a giant magnet had turned on and we were transfixed. No. Compelled to look.\n\nJavier's walkie talkie came alive and all at once, the illusion of safety was shredded away by a distorted scream.\n\n\"–front door breach!!\"\n\nFMSK burst through the door, a single kick to the bolt lock shattering the wooden frame, a shot that channeled all the power of his approach, which the officers would later describe as \"super human\" and \"he just appeared in front of us at full speed\".\n\nThe door flew through the hall and down came the masked killer over it, eyes raging. Just as both Javier and I could start to stand, the killer's black mask turned transparent, exposing a sickened sneer, and he bellowed a furious roar that shot Javier off his feet and flying into the glass sliding door behind us.\n\nThe glass cracked loudly and Javier doubled over in pain.\n\nFMSK looked at me with disgust and contempt… wait, there was something else in that look.\n\nConfusion.\n\n(The jello spell. It protects.)\n\nFMSK moved forward, and at once I braced for his impact, processing the kitchen knife tucked into his forearm, and his mask had turned back to black.\n\nI never stood a chance.\n\nFMSK faked a hurtle towards me, then immediately pivoted up the stairs, racing three steps at a time, showing his true intended target.\n\nI screamed and shot forward, the police just starting to come in, Detective Javier still getting up from the shattered glass, and I started running up the stairs, knowing I was too late.\n\nI heard a terrible howl and the house shook from the weight of an incredible fall, and I ascended the stairs as fast I clumsily could, tears streaming down my face at the thought of my ravaged girl.\n\nThe screams intensified and it sounded like a ravenous, starving animal finally satiating a long hunger.\n\nWhen I finally got to the landing, there flat on his back and thrashing wildly was the Full Moon Serial Killer with the knife protruding from in-between his ribs, blood spurting with each convulsion, all four of his appendages moving involuntarily in sick, painful spasms. \n\nClara was calmly watching cartoons, occasionally glancing to the side at the howling mean man man.\n\nI jumped over MMM, his face enraged at his helplessness and his screams turned to shouted growls as he futilely attempted to claw at me.\n\nI grabbed Clara, and put myself between her and the killer, pressing back against the window on the far wall.\n\nThe officers were upon us and encircled FMSK, guns pointing down as he continued to thrash uncontrollably, the knife still lodged in his ribs.\n\nDetective Javier had made it up as well and dove onto the killer, grabbing both of his hands by the wrists, pinning him in place.\n\nClara had been sneaking peeks despite my upheld hand and I moved to cover her more from the grisly scene.\n\nWhen I embraced her, further cupping my hand over her eyes, she turned to me, gazing with her soft hazel eyes. I thought I saw them swirling.\n\n\"See Daddy, I told you the jello spell would protect us.\"\n\n\"Jello spell?\"\n\nClara giggled.\n\n\"Wiggly arms and legs!\" she said, \"And it was strawberry, your favorite.\"\n\nFMSK continued to thrash uncontrollably, his growls turning to gurgles, Javier still sprawled over him trying his best to hold his arms. The killer's face was frozen in hatred, and I could feel his gaze go through me and directly to Clara.\n\n\"And the birds were also watching,\" Clara said as she focused back to the cartoons. \"So we were protected.\"\n\n\"I–What birds?\"\n\nClara pointed over her shoulder out the window to the sports complex, eyes still glued to the television.\n\nI pushed aside the shades and gasped. The entire complex was covered in birds of all types, perched atop wires, bleachers, and goalposts, and not one of them made a movement or sound.\n\nIt was the stillness that horrified me more than anything.\n\nFMSK began to froth red at the mouth and his convulsions turned stiffer.\n\nThen in the far soccer field I saw La Nona, skin like ash and eyes sunken, hunched over with a peculiar smile that seemed to beckon me. \n\nMy hands went to my face.\n\nShe started to move her blackened lips.\n\nAnd one blink later she was gone. I heard three distinct gusts of air in the distance (or was it laughs?) and felt tears fall down my cheeks.\n\nFMSK's movement stopped, and I caught one last glimpse of his contorted face, his mask pulled down by a wild swing of his clawed hands. The expression could only be described as unadulterated anger. \n\nI felt Clara hug me tighter and rub my back softly.\n\n\"La Nona says hi,\" she whispered.\n\nMy eyes shot one more time out the window, expecting to see her corpse once more, bellowing at my disbelief. \n\nBut there were only the birds. As if on cue, they started to dissipate from their perches in a silent, gentle rolling wave that caressed the purple sunset.\n\nThe night was about to begin and the mean moon man had run out of time. He stiffened at last, his appendages a tangled mess caked in strawberry blood.\n\n\"La Nona died three years ago,\" I said, softly.\n\nClara was unfazed.\n\n\"Hmm, hmm, hmm.\"",

        "text": "I didn’t want to go on the research trip to Brazil.\n\nUnfortunately, my graduate advisor had other ideas. He pushed me to go with the team and help collect data for the project. They needed a lot of help. I grudgingly acknowledged it was probably a good career move, since the project had a lot of big names attached to it. Hopefully I would get a research credit on the paper, whenever it was published.\n\nStill, camping in the Pampas backcountry had not been my idea of a good time. The data collection was hot and dirty (investigating soybean pests), the ground at our campsite had been so hard and lumpy I’d barely gotten any sleep at all, and not to mention the greasy food had given me indigestion. Just thinking about the beef now still made me feel queasy. \n\nI couldn’t wait to get home, even if it was just back to my grimy grad school apartment.\n\nIt was hot in my living room that evening. I’d contacted my landlord about the air conditioner several times with no response. The lukewarm air pumping out of the window unit barely even cooled the apartment. \n\nI took a sip of my beer and squinted at my computer screen. A dozen or so rows of rectangles glared back at me, filled with incomprehensible numbers.\n\nI’d been working on this data set for hours in preparation for an upcoming deadline. My stomach growled, but I refused to break my concentration by getting up and cooking a real dinner, instead snacking on cheese crackers and peanuts.\n\nI pulled the numbers into a pivot table and created a rudimentary line graph in excel, just to get a preliminary look at the trends. An unusual correlation surprised me, and I bent closer to the screen. \n\nA buzzing sound across the room made me glance up. I scanned the room, looking for the source, but the room had gone quiet. *Dammit, now I’ve got bugs in here. I can’t wait to move out of this place.* I sighed and glanced back down at the graph.\n\nThen I heard it again. \n\nI was quick enough that time to see the source of the buzzing. A large, winged insect had landed on the flickering TV screen.\n\n“EW!” I shrieked. I jumped up from the table and searched for something I could use to smash it, finally grabbing a discarded flip flop by the door. I ran to the TV, gently squishing the bug.\n\nExcept there was no crunch.\n\nI frowned. What? \n\nI pulled the shoe back from the screen. There was no blob of bug goo, as I’d expected. \n\nThere wasn’t anything there at all.\n\n*What the hell. I’m losing it.*\n\nI flipped the shoe over. A single, iridescent wing stuck to the bottom. I carefully picked it off and held it up in front of my face. Its sheer, gossamer filaments were so delicate. \n\n*I could have stepped on that outside,* I reasoned. Had to- there was no other evidence of a bug anywhere.\n\nI didn’t want to think about it coming from anywhere else.\n\nI shrugged it off to the long hours staring at the data set and general grad school fatigue. School was clearly impacting my mental health, and on top of that I was still worn out from my recent trip. I decided to call it an evening. I finished up my beer and watched a few episodes of TV before heading to bed.\n\nI drifted off to sleep as soon as my head hit the pillow.\n\n*I found myself walking in an endless sea of tall grass. The more I pushed through the greenery, the more the blades sliced at my hands and face. The matted grass ensnared my feet. A black cloud of flies danced around my face, landing on my neck, my eyes, my mouth…*\n\nI sat upright in bed with a gasp. My sheets and pillow were covered with sweat.\n\n“What the actual hell,” I muttered, before flopping back on my pillow. I took several careful, deep breaths to slow my heartbeat.\n\nOf course. The bugs. The one in the living room must have triggered the memory.\n\nOn the trip, they’d been deep in a crop field when they stumbled across the nest. \n\nNo one was able to identify the insects right away, which meant it was likely a new species. Since they were actively eating the crops, however, another student and I were instructed to exterminate them. The chemical spray had sent the nest into a frenzy, sending up a cloud of irritated, black insects that clung to our neck and faces. \n\nThe experience left my skin crawling long after I’d brushed them all away. \n\nI held up my wrist and looked at my Fitbit. 6:50 AM. If I got up now, I could work a few more hours before class. I hated that my brain automatically tried to squeeze in a bit more school work instead of a few more moments of sleep.\n\nReluctantly, I dragged myself out of bed and shuffled into the bathroom. As I was brushing my teeth, I inspected my face in the mirror. So pale, and now I had permanent dark circles under my eyes. I really was going to have to get more rest. \n\nThat’s when I noticed it. \n\nThe zit.\n\nI gently probed the bump with my index finger. It felt very hard and painful. \n\nI love popping zits. I know I’m not the only one. I gave the bump a tentative squeeze, my fingernails pushing deep around the perimeter of the bump.\n\nA tiny ball of a hard, whitish substance erupted out of the zit. *Ugh. Yes.* I wiped it away and gently pressed a tissue to my chin. \n\nI looked closer at the little zit ball, now laying on the sink edge. It was an elongated oval. It reminded me of something, although I couldn’t immediately place it.\n\nI bent closer, frowning. Had I picked something up when I was in Brazil? It almost looked like..\n\nI screamed. It couldn’t be.\n\nThe tiny egg on the sink pulsated, and began to [crack.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SunshineScarystories/comments/x88quz/story_index/)",

        "text": "The flames of the campfire were burning high at the heart of Camp Wanapoke, casting all of our features in a flickering orange glow.  We sat on large wooden logs which had been cut to make crude stools and the one beneath me was wobbling back and forth on the uneven ground as I listened to the camp counselors telling their stories.  The sky above was full of stars and no moon was out that night, making the forest all around us even darker than usual.\n\n“So remember, boys.  If you’re ever out on a hike in the woods at night and you hear a voice calling to you from deep inside the forest, telling you to come closer, speaking in the voice of a friend or family member…  Don’t follow that sound.  Don’t listen to the voices.  Make sure you stay on the path, and run back home before you come face to face with…  THE WAMPALUNG!”\n\nAn ember popped loudly in the fire and one or two boys jumped from their seats, gasping.  But mostly the kids’ faces surrounding me did not look impressed.  \n\nThe grown ups are doing what grown ups do best, I thought to myself.  They’re trying to terrify us before bedtime, telling stories of creatures in the forest that come out at night. \n\nExcept most of us weren’t buying their bullshit.  \n\nMaybe if we’d believed them, none of this would have happened.  Maybe they’d all still be alive.  \n\nBut we were arrogant.  We all thought we knew better.  \n\n“You guys are just trying to scare us,” Billy called out indignantly, interrupting the story.  Suddenly it was dead silent around the circle, and the only sounds were crickets and the crackle of the fire.  \n\n“Yeah, ain’t no such thing as monsters!  My parents told me there ain't,” another kid chimed in.  \n\nThe camp counselors were sitting passively, listening to the objections, but their faces didn’t change.  They looked stern and serious - in stark contrast to the happy-go-lucky demeanors we’d been used to seeing all week.  Their solemn eyes reflected the flames as they tried again to convince us.  \n\n“Your parents have never been to camp Wanapoke,” one of the counselors named Chris responded.  “If they had, they’d confirm that what we’re telling you is true.  I know you guys think we’re just trying to scare you, but that’s not what this is.”\n\n“My parents went to camp here, and so did my brother!  They never said anything about Wampalungs,” Greg said.  He and I were sitting next to each other - we’d become close friends over the past week at summer camp and had vowed to keep in touch after we both went home.    \n\n“That’s because you’re not supposed to speak of the Wampalung.  If you talk about them, that’s when they come out from the forest.” \n\n“So then why say anything, if it’s just going to lure them out?” Billy asked, his voice argumentative.\n\n“We debated not telling you all.  But it’s a moonless night and that’s their favourite time to hunt.  Especially when the weather is warm like it is tonight.  The two of us decided it was worth the risk to warn you kids - since it’s the last night of camp a lot of kids like to go out in the forest and get into trouble.  That would be a risky proposition tonight, understand?  These creatures are dangerous as hell.”\n\nOne kid on the other side of the fire said something under his breath which elicited laughter from a dozen campers over there, but I didn’t hear what it was exactly.  The roar of the fire and the muttering of other campers drowned it out.  But I got the feeling the counselors heard it, and didn't like what was said.\n\n“That's it,” shouted Zach, the sterner of the two counselors.  “Nobody leaves their cabins tonight, for any reason!  Got it?  End of story.  If you need to take a leak, use an empty water bottle.”\n\nWe all groaned and the sound of complaining rose up into the night air, growing louder and louder with each passing second.  \n\nZach silenced it quickly with his patented two-fingered whistle - the screech of it piercing our ears and causing each of us to quiet down.  \n\n“End of story,” he said again with finality.  \n\nWe returned to our bunks, whispering quietly amongst ourselves as we walked through the forest, trying to figure out whether we were being played.  \n\nIt might have been my imagination, but I couldn’t help but feel like I was being watched - as if there were eyes observing me from the darkness of the forest.  Every shape and shadow in the trees was a little bit suspicious now, and I found myself jumping at the sound of rustling leaves and the flap of bat wings as one screeched above me.  \n\nFinally we made it to the clearing full of small shacks that served as sleeping quarters.  Four of us were in each cramped cabin and we parted ways as all of the groups went to their own bunks for the night.  \n\nGreg and I were in one cabin with two other guys named Billy and Tim.  It was Billy who got us into so much trouble, I realize now, looking back.  If not for him we probably would have just stayed inside for the rest of the night like we were supposed to.  \n\n“You guys don’t really believe that bullshit, do you,” Billy said mockingly, once we were inside.  “Wampalungs and dead campers?  Pfft, come on, give me a break!”\n\nI had been feeling halfway convinced about the stories being true.  But something about the way he said that made me wonder if it really had just been a hoax.  \n\nAs a kid with an older brother who loved to make up tall tales, I had been fooled more than once before.  So many times I’d found myself buying into my older brother's lies only to find out later that it was all bullshit.\n\n“If someone told you the word ‘gullible’ was written on the ceiling, you’d look up,” my old brother had told me once, laughing at me for believing his most recent fraud.  \n\nSo now I found myself wondering if that was what was happening again.  Was this just another Santa Claus situation?  Was the Wampalung like the Easter Bunny?  Except instead of bringing chocolate eggs he decapitated kids?\n\n“Yeah, you’re right,” I said hesitantly.  “There’s no such thing as the Wampalung.  It’s all just a story.”\n\nBilly’s eyes were mean and he looked at me with a sneer.  \n\n“Ha!  You say that now, but I saw you out there at the campfire.  You were eating up every word of that bullshit they were feeding us!”\n\n“Give him a break,” said Greg, getting into bed on the lower bunk.  “None of us really believed that crap.  Let’s just get some sleep.”\n\nI started getting into my bunk as well but Billy would have none of that.  \n\n“You guys are so dumb.  I can’t believe you really bought that load of shit.  What a bunch of idiots.”\n\nGreg leapt back up out of bed, looking angry.  \n\n“Just drop it, man!  We didn’t believe the stupid story!”\n\n“Oh yeah?  Well, prove it!  Let’s go out in the forest and I want to hear the two of you say its name.\"\n\n\"What the hell is that supposed to prove!?\"\n\n\"They said it comes out when you call its name, right?  So, you say ‘Wampalung’ three times out loud and I’ll believe you.  Otherwise I say you’re both chicken-shit losers with no guts.”\n\n\"Wampalung, Wampalung, Wampalung!  There!  Are you happy!?\"\n\n\"Not here.  Out in the forest.  We're gonna go for a little hike, you pansies.\"\n\n“Yeah right, this is so stupid. I don’t need to prove anything to you,” Greg turned around and walked back to his bunk.  \n\n“Just what I thought.  Gutless losers.”\n\nTim stood up next to him and pitched in with another outdated attempt at mocking us.  \n\n“Ha, look at the pussies, hiding inside, scared of the big bad Wampalung,” he laughed.  \n\nGreg and I exchanged a look.  We both nodded at each other reluctantly.  Neither one of us wanted to be called a coward.  It was somehow even worse than being called gullible.  And nobody wanted to go to their grave being seen as chicken-shit.\n\n“Fine,” I said.  “Let’s go.  But you guys are gonna say it too.  Three times, just like us.  Otherwise how do we know you’re not scared?”\n\nBilly’s eyes hardened.  \n\n“Great,” he said.  “Perfect.  Let’s go.  You guys lead the way.”\n\nHe held the door open for us.  Greg and I got up reluctantly and put on our shoes.  Tim and Billy did the same.  \n\n“You can lead the way,” I said, grabbing the door from Billy.  “This is your idea, dickhead.  You go first.  We’ll be right behind you.”\n\nBilly gulped, suddenly looking a little more nervous.  I began to get the feeling he had thought we’d back down.  Tim’s eyes were darting around the trees as he stepped down onto the grass, and we followed after them.  \n\nIf they had been worried, they put on brave faces again a second later, stomping into the woods and glancing back to make sure we were following.  \n\n“Come on,” Greg said.  “Let’s get this over with.”\n\nWe marched through the trees,  deeper and deeper into the forest.  It was pitch black outside and none of us had brought a flashlight, I realized, as it became more and more difficult to see.  \n\nWith each step forward I grew more and more uneasy.  I kept getting the distinct feeling that I was being watched again.  And not just from one place, but from several different locations.  It was like a tingling sensation on my skin that grew more and more intense as we ventured further into the darkness of the woods.  \n\nThe trees began pressing in around us and suddenly I found myself tripping over roots and shrubs and getting tangled in vines.  Muddy ground threatened to swallow my shoes with each step, trying to pull them from my feet.  \n\n\"Where's the path?\" Billy asked, looking down.  He started turning and wandering around, trying to locate the dirt path we had been following. \"It was right here.  We were on the path a second ago…\"\n\n“We’ll just backtrack,” said Tim.  “C’mon let’s get this over with already.”  \n\nHe was looking around nervously and then his eyes settled on me.  \n\n“Well, go ahead.  Do it!  Say the name.”\n\nI stood there nervously, looking around for any signs of movement nearby.  As far as I could tell, we were alone.  \n\n“Are you sure about this,” Greg said suddenly.  “We don’t need to do this for real.  Do we?”\n\nHesitating, I was about to agree with him, when Billy interjected.  \n\n“Ha!  I knew you guys were pussies!  Check it out, losers.  There’s nothing but a bunch of frickin’ crickets out here!”\n\nHe took a couple steps away from us and then cupped his hands around his mouth.  \n\n“WAMPALUNG, WAMPALUNG, WAMPALUNG!  Hey, come and get it!  Fresh meat, right this way!  I hope you like chicken!”\n\nThen he turned around and smiled at us, looking very proud of himself. \n\n“See?  Told you idiots.  There’s no such thing as…\"\n\nHe broke off suddenly at the sound of a dry twig snapping somewhere a little ways away.\n\n\"What the hell was that?  Did you guys hear that?”\n\nAnother odd sound came from the woods nearby which I couldn’t place.  It didn’t sound like anything I’d ever heard before.  There was a sound of cracking branches high in the trees after that and I realized it was someone or something very tall moving towards us.\n\nWhatever it was, it was moving fast.\n\n\"What the hell is that?\" Greg asked, backing up.  \n\n\"I don't know.  But whatever it is, it doesn't sound like a person.\"\n\nA scream suddenly came from the trees to our left - sounding like a man in terrible pain and anguish.  Someone crying out in distress and hurt.  His voice sounded familiar.  \n\nBut then a second later that scream broke off into insane laughter.\n\n\"This way, guys.  Over here,\" a voice said from the right.\n\n“Who is that?” I asked.\n\n“I don’t know,” Billy said.  “It kinda sounds like… Zach.  The camp counselor”  \n\nHe was the one who had warned us about the Wampalung.  Only his voice now sounded different.  Darker.  And strained, as if trying very hard to sound normal but failing.  \n\n\"All you have to do is take a few steps from where you are, over towards me, and you'll be safe.  Huh ha!  C'mon, guys.  You know me.  Come over this way.  It's safe.\"\n\nThe voice was persistent and friendly, but there was an undertone of something unpleasant underneath.  An impatience which hinted at an urgent need left unfulfilled for too long.  \n\nA hunger left unsated.\n\n\"Come - ERK - here…. Now!\" \n\nThe voice was breaking apart now, devolving into something strangled, animalistic, and difficult to discern.  An alien tongue which was unlike our own.  Like a jackal trying to talk.\n\nZach's face suddenly appeared in the shadows, walking steadily towards us.  But there was something very wrong with him.  I couldn't tell what it was at first, it was so dark and difficult to see in that forest with no moon.  \n\nAs he drew closer, though, I saw why he looked so surreal. \n\nHis strides were stilted and unnatural, his body far too tall, too slender and dark, lacking features of any kind except for on his face.  When I took in his visage more closely I saw it was slack and emotionless, like a corpse's face inside a coffin.   \n\nThe body beneath him was not his own, I realized.  His form was black so that it blended perfectly with the shadows of the forest.  Whatever this thing was, it was wearing Zach’s head like a hat, and using it as a disguise.  \n\nIt looked to me like a nightmare creature made of black ink and shadow.  With no moonlight to illuminate the thing it made it even more terrifying.  Only glimpses of it could be seen in the darkness, while the floating head of our camp counselor sat atop its swirling liquid form.  \n\n“Are you boys looking for the Wampalung?” Zach’s dead face asked, his jaw making painful crunching sounds with each word.  Blood poured from his mouth, dribbling down his chin.  “You shouldn’t be scared of it.  You should embrace it.  Become part of the Wampalung, boys.  Join the liquid shadows of the forest.  That way you’ll never have to leave Camp Wanapoke.  You can stay here forever.”\n\nHis words devolved into a garbling jumble and he ducked behind a tree, vanishing completely.  \n\nIt was totally silent in the woods for a few moments except for the sounds of our rapid, terrified breathing.  But then I heard movement coming from all around us.  Slithering sounds like snakes approaching on the ground.  And its words came from every direction, like a thousand voices speaking at once.  \n\n“I can show it to you!  I can introduce you!  Don’t you want to become one with us?  In the darkness we all become as one.”\n\nI looked down and recoiled when I saw a puddle of black inky sludge spreading out towards me from the shadows of the forest.  It rolled in towards me with a dreadful power teeming beneath the surface of it, electric like a thunder storm’s static in the air. \n\n“What is that shit!?” Billy screamed, seeing the same thing that I was now observing - a spreading flood of malignant darkness getting closer by the second.\n\n“I don’t know!  I don’t know!” I yelled back, feeling hysterical - on the brink of a complete panic attack.  All ability to reason was gone and my fight or flight mode had kicked into overdrive - and I wasn’t the only one.    \n\n“Run!” Greg shouted, trying to avoid stepping on the encroaching puddles of darkness which were now moving in closer on all sides.  \n\nThere was only one way to go, I saw.  And it meant going even deeper into the forest.  Further away from the camp and from safety.  \n\nThe four of us bolted from the trees into a clearing, running as fast as we could away from that spot.  When I looked back over my shoulder I saw the twisted shadow figure regaining its shape and standing upright again.  It began chasing after us with a lopsided, shuffling gait.  The thing was bulbous and deformed - laboring with each movement, like an escaped bipedal python after consuming a beloved housepet.  \n\nThe shadow-creature was malformed and stretched out in places, while looking bloated and almost bursting in other spots.  The whole appearance of it was wrong - hurting the eyes and making my brain feel scrambled every time I stared for too long.  It reminded me of that old anime movie “Akira.”  I didn’t want to look at it but I had to.  I couldn’t turn away.    \n\n“Come back, boys,” Zach’s decapitated head shouted after us, still in a twisted imitation of his own voice.  “I just want to help… Want to…. Wampalung, wampalung, wampalung…”\n\nIt began a strange chanting incantation and I saw more tendrils of darkness leaking out from the treeline all around us.  The creature was calling to its own, drawing out more of its power.  \n\nThe sound of that ominous chanting began to come from the trees all around us, joining the creature’s sickening voice.  A low noise like rumbling thunder in the distance, repeating that dark word over and over again until it no longer had any meaning.  \n\n“This way!  We can try to circle back towards camp,” Greg said, pointing off to the right where a path was visible.  It looked familiar, and I hoped he was right.  \n\nThe trees closed in again as we ducked through their boughs, out of the clearing and onto the path.  Dark chants and heavy footfalls could be heard in pursuit, not far behind.  And then there was the ominous sound of tree boughs breaking and snapping as something much larger than any of us chased us through the forest.  \n\nEntire trees were soon collapsing in its wake, the thing gaining on us with each passing second, like a tsunami wave that we could not outrun.  \n\nI was terrified to look back, knowing that it was just a few steps behind.  I could hear its breath wheezing in and out with crackling gasps.  \n\nBilly tripped over a root and before I even realized what had happened I had passed by him.  \n\nThen the sounds of him being consumed by the Wampalung could be heard sickeningly behind us.  His bones crunched as he let out a howling cry of agony.  \n\nI managed to look back for a second and saw the shadow-form of the Wampalung crouching over him, feeding on his flesh and tearing it from his bones.  The thing seemed to absorb Billy’s very essence, pulling him into the black tar of its form and subsuming him.  He wailed and screamed, the pitch of his voice going higher as he was eaten alive.  \n\nOnly his head was kept whole and intact, and the creature added it to its collection, grasping it by the temples and holding it up to us like a trophy as we escaped.\n\nOnly we hadn't really escaped.  We were only running deeper and deeper into the darkness of the forest.\n\nInto ITS territory.\n\n\n*\n\n\n\"I think we're safe.  It's gone,\" Greg said as we sat catching our breath behind a tree.  \n\n\"I don't know, man.  It could still be out here anywhere.  Just don't say the name.  Whatever you do, don't say the name.\"\n\nWe'd been running for twenty minutes or more and now I had absolutely no idea where we were.  The forest looked the same in every direction and no way looked safer or better than any other.  The way back towards camp was also the way back towards the creature.  Even in my mind I didn't want to consider its name, fearing it would somehow still draw it to us.  \n\n\"What the hell do we do?  We can't just keep running.  Who knows how far out into the wilderness we could end up.  If we don't die from that THING, then we'll die from being stuck out here without food or water!\"\n\nHe made a good point.  \n\n\"Let's try backtracking.  Maybe we can find our way back to the path.  Maybe it's gone now.\"\n\n\"Good idea.  Hey, did you see Tim?  I thought he was with us.\"\n\n\"I thought he was right behind you.\"\n\nWe both looked around nervously.\n\n\"Shit.\"\n\nTim was nowhere to be seen.  He was just gone.  \n\n\"Maybe he turned back already.  Hopefully we'll catch up with him.\"\n\nThe two of us began moving quietly in the direction of the campsite.  At least, we were pretty sure we were heading back towards the campsite, it was difficult to know for certain.\n\nEach step I took seemed so loud in the stillness of the forest.  Each twig snapping underfoot sounding like a gunshot being fired.  The crunching leaves made me wince with every movement.\n\nFor a good twenty minutes or more we walked on eggshells, terrified of every shadow and every sound in the darkness.  \n\nAfter a while I started to wonder if maybe we’d missed the camp completely, and if we were now walking far past our destination, wandering deeper and deeper into the wilderness with each passing second.  \n\nI breathed a sigh of relief when eventually we came into a clearing and I saw the silhouettes of the cabins up ahead.  The lights were all off as the inhabitants slept inside.  The other campers and counselors were still unaware of the bloodbath which had just occurred a few hundred yards away.  \n\nI ran up to the door of the cabin on the far left, which was slightly larger than the others.  It was where the camp counselors stayed.  \n\nIf there was ever a moment when I needed a grown-up, this was it.  \n\nI raced up to the door and was about to knock and start yelling, waking up the camp, when I heard a sound coming from the forest behind me.  \n\n\"Psst, over here!\" a voice called from the darkness.  It sounded like Tim.  \n\nHad the Wampalung gotten him too?  Was it now using his voice to lure us away from safety?\n\n“Come here!”\n\nI ignored it and began hammering on the door, and a second later I heard movement coming from inside.  \n\n\"Chris!  Help!  That thing got Zach!  It got Billy and Tim!  Let us in, please!\"\n\nSomeone came to the door on the other side and I heard it begin to open up, a voice speaking softly from inside.  \n\n\"What got them?  What are you talking about?\"\n\nMy heart was hammering in my chest as I realized suddenly that there was something wrong.  Something was off about all of this.  \n\nThe cabin in front of me was too dark - as if it had been constructed of shadow and black ink instead of wood.  Its surface reflected the stars and was cool, slick, and unpleasant to the touch.\n\n\"What got them?\" repeated the voice from the shadow cabin.  \"Say its name.\"\n\nI began to back away when I heard the voice calling from the woods again, in Tim's voice, clear and true.\n\n\"Run!  It's not real!!!\"\n\nWith that the entire mirage of the cabin dissolved and I fell several feet into the dirt from where I had been standing.  \n\nA dark form stood over me, leaning above my face with malicious-looking eyes.  It was about to kill me, I was sure of it.  Only I wouldn’t just die, I would become part of that terrible thing which lived forever and fed on innocents.  A thing which existed only to hate and cause harm.  A thing which lived in darkness and could not exist in the light.\n\nThat was when it hit me.  \n\nIt needed the darkness…. That was why it lured us out so far.  Why it only hunted before the moon had risen.\n\nI didn’t have a flashlight, but I did have one other source of light with me.  Part of being a scout was being prepared, and that meant being ready to build a fire if you needed to.  \n\nAs the thing came within inches of my face, I struggled to pull the pack of matches from my pocket.  Pulling several free at once, I pinched the matchbook's abrasive strip around them and raked the match-heads against it, setting them ablaze in my hand.  They burnt my fingers badly but I didn’t even notice at the time, the sting of that feeling insignificant compared to the terror of what I was facing.  \n\n“RRRREEEEEEeeeeee!!! \n\nThe Wampalung snapped backwards as if hit by a semi truck, rolling and then crab walking away, injured, towards the treeline.  Its skin blistered and bubbled - pustules on the surface popping and sending steam hissing into the night air.  \n\nWithout wasting one more moment of time, Greg and I ran to join Tim where he was hiding.  \n\nThe three of us ran from there, not sure if we had overshot the camp or had simply not walked far enough.  We took a risk and kept heading the same direction we were going before, hoping that the Wampalung was gone for now.  \n\nA few minutes later we saw the lights up ahead and realized this time it was the actual campsite.  No more tricks or illusions.  \n\nWe began to scream for help as one light after another flipped on in the camp, glowing brighter in the darkness.  \n\nI made it home alive.  But to this day I see the shadows bend and twist sometimes, as if that thing is still watching me.  From the darkness of my bedroom closet or the space behind the shower curtain, anywhere there is a shadow, I hear a vague murmur of:\n\nWampalung, wampalung, [wampalung.](https://youtube.com/@JordanGrupe)\n\n\n[JG](https://www.reddit.com/r/JGcreepypastas/comments/raq7ay/all_stories_20212022/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)  \n\n\n[TCC](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)",

        "text": "  \n\nThat was the absolute change I needed to put my troublesome past behind me once for all, my exact thoughts upon arriving in town. From living in a log cabin near a forest to moving in a house in the big city, the change in scenery was drastic. \n\nFortunately, I had moved with my dog Mace, a weimaraner I used to hunt with. Just like where I was staying previously, I chose to let Mace experience total freedom and explore the new environment as he would always return home. \n\nLast year during one night, around 1am, I saw Mace bark at something in the street. I could not see who or what it was but I assumed it might have been a cat hiding behind the fence. The moment I was about to call him, Mace jumped over the fence and gave chase to the invisible intruder, but I remained calm and confident. \n\nI found him the next morning, sleeping in the yard but covered in blood. I panicked at first, thinking he was hurt but it was not his blood at all and I feared for the worst, hoping that he really just attacked a fellow animal. He looked so tired that day and did not bark once. \n\nAfter not seeing any alert concerning an animal attack or not having cops knocking on my door, the paranoia began to wear off but immediately rose to superior heights, when I noticed that Mace had vanished around 2am. He was out again. I spent hours waiting for him in complete panic mode and saw him come back around 4:30 am all clean except for wet and dirty legs. I sighed in relief and went to sleep. \n\nThe next morning, I woke up to Mace standing next to my bed and just staring, as he seemed to have watched me sleep. That cycle had then repeated itself for the next two weeks. I had started locking the doors and the windows to keep him in but to no avail. He would suddenly disappear at night for hours and mysteriously be back with dirty legs, before staring at me for hours whether I was sleeping or not. \n\nWhat really terrified me up to that point was his behavior; no tail wagging, no barking, and his mouth always closed as well as an increased intelligence I could not comprehend. I started finding him hiding in strange places, such as inside very high and closed cupboards in the kitchen I know he could not climb or jump to. \n\nOne night, Mace raised the bar so high that I could no longer allow all that to keep going. He mysteriously disappeared again a few minutes after midnight as soon as I lost sight of him for like 5 seconds. He then mysteriously returned at 4am, emerging from under the kitchen table. I switched the light on to clearly see what state he was in but I fell backwards in fear when I saw what he had in his mouth. It was a human hand. \n\nAs if he realized that his game was up, he terrified me further by storming to a window and breaking the glass to escape. Even in movies, I never saw any animal perform that stunt. I did not sleep that night and waited for him until 7am. Mace came back without the hand which I assumed he ate and I yelled at him, asking him to tell me what he did last night as if he could just answer me like a human being. \n\nHe was only staring at me shouting, which angered me further as of course he could not realize the evil he possibly committed and its dire consequences for the both of us. I removed my belt to teach him a lesson, completely out of my mind, but as soon as he saw it, Mace lunged at me and I realize the power that he had. He held me on the ground, no barking, no growling, he just poured his new lifeless and emotionless eyes into mine, ensuring his dominance over me before he just released me. He then walked to a corner of the room, turned to me and stared. At that moment, I had decided to get to the bottom of the situation.\n\nWhen the night set in, I went to hide somewhere near my house, hoping to not be seen by anyone. It was 12:47 am and I was waiting for Mace to come out. He did, at 1:58 am through the window he broke the day before, and in front of which I know I had placed a heavy furniture. For about one hour and a half, I followed him, covered with a special mixture to cover my scent. \n\nIt started to remind me of the thrill of hunting as old reflexes resurfaced despite the scenery changing from trees to buildings. Mace reached a deserted place and disappeared in some kind of hole. I ran to investigate and saw that it was not a hole, but one of those big sewer entrance with a gate. Using my phone flashlight, I followed, hit all along the way by the recognizable and unbearable smell of rotting flesh, until some painful memories from my past started to resurface. \n\nAll of it vanished suddenly when I saw a twinkling red light and heard several animals or people masticating. I regretted not bringing any weapon when I saw the horrifying spectacle before me: the glowing red light came from occult looking symbols drawn on the walls and on what seemed to be an altar with a dead human body on it. Mace, along with several other animals and two persons were busy devouring the body. \n\nBefore I could even react to such horror, Mace turned as if he had noticed me, his eyes glowing in red. I ran for my life, not pursued at first, falling in the dirty water and getting back up on many occasions until I exited the sewers. I then looked behind me in the darkness and spotted two glowing red eyes approaching at tremendous speed. Mace was giving chase. \n\nDetermined to save my life, I ran as fast as I could, reached a road, and crossed it bearing in mind that I would be better off being hit by a truck than to be devoured by my own dog. Mace attempted the crossing and a car ran him over. The car stopped for a few seconds, then sped off, taking advantage of the late hour to run the red lights. \n\nI approached my dog, not knowing what to think and what to do. He was shaking, with a frequency that left no doubt in my mind when the monstrous sounds came out of his mouth at the same pace. He was laughing, or maybe something evil through him laughed at me until his glowing red eyes returned to normal and he expired. \n\nNobody ever believed what you just read, including the police. Nobody ever went to check what was going on in those sewers, or if some people did, they never lived to tell the story. \n\nDue to many bad experiences and memories, this time, I moved to another continent this year, hoping to live a normal life and finally forget about my past entirely.",

        "text": " I was standing beside my kitchen sink when I saw his reflection. His face loomed large in my spoon as I ate oatmeal with raisins. The dull concave surface flipped and warped our images, making our faces broad and grotesque. My image was upside down and above. His image was right side up and below.\n\nHe was reaching up to touch me. A fierce wind I could not feel or hear blew his long black hair away from his pale face. For a moment, our eyes met in the blurry reflection.  \n\nThen he vanished.\n\nPanic settled around me as I forced myself to turn and face whoever had entered my apartment. No one was there.\n\nI lunged for my purse and the pepper spray hidden inside. Desperately searching through the chaos that is my purse grew frustrating, so I gave up and dumped everything on the floor. I grabbed the pepper spray before it rolled under the oven and prepared myself too fight.\n\nBut no one attacked me. The figure had left.\n\nMoving from my spot next to the kitchen counter took some time. Then the logical part of my brain began working as the panic subsided.\n\nI walked forward into my apartment with the pepper spray raised.\n\nThe spoon's bowl flipped our images vertically. If the man I had seen was real, he would have stood on my ceiling.\n\nI looked to the ceiling for some sign that a man had been standing on it but found none.\n\nA wind I had not felt or heard blew back the man's dark hair. Where did the wind come from? I don’t own a fan.\n\nAnd finally, the man could not have escaped the confines of my apartment so suddenly. Where would he go? I only have one bedroom.\n\nI checked the bathroom to be sure. Nothing.\n\nMaybe I had imagined the whole thing. Maybe I ate a bad raisin.\n\nFor two months, the figure in my spoon never crossed my mind. I forgot about the man completely. It was as if he was a dream lost in the realm of sleep.\n\nI was in public the next time I saw him.\n\nStacy, a friend from work, was helping me buy makeup. We laughed as we gossiped about our horrible bosses at the coffee shop. I guffawed as she mimicked the nasal twang of our day manager.\n\n\"oops, did I mess up your time card again? Well, we can't have anyone working over 30 hours because that would make you full-time, and then we would have to offer you benefits. By the way, I need you to come in on your day off and work two hours because we're short-staffed.\" Stacy said with a pout.\n\nI'll admit it was sad, desperate laughter, but it was nice to laugh just the same.\n\nThen I saw him for just a moment.\n\nEverything came back. The minutiae of the first time I saw the man flooded my mind. The oatmeal. The wind. Our eyes meeting for that one moment. His disappearance. It all came back, and I was terrified.\n\nMy mind whirled as I tried to locate him among the department store crowd. I scanned the room quickly until an overwhelming feeling of menace gripped me. Then almost without thinking, my head pivoted towards an oversized makeup mirror.\n\nThe mirror at the counter was much larger than a regular makeup mirror. The purpose of the mirror was to magnify your flaws, so eager salesclerks could upsell the foundation creams. As I stared into the mirror's curved depths, I realized the images in the mirror were flipped like the spoon when I had seen the man the first time.\n\nMy reflection was upside down and above. The man's reflection was right side up and below.\n\nBehind my image, I saw his form leaning into a gale of wind. Struggling to move forward one small step at a time. His image was sharper and easier to see, making him all the more real.\n\nHis whole body was visible in the mirror. He stood on the air. Nothing supported his weight, but he struggled forward as if walking up a hill during a hurricane. Occasionally the wind would buffet the man, and he would stagger, either being pushed back or falling forward.\n\nI turned around, but he was nowhere to be seen. Then my eyes crept back to the mirror. I watched in horror as he struggled forward, coming ever closer.\n\nFinally, I forced myself to take a long look at him.\n\nThe man is tall and gaunt. His hair is long, dark, and matted. His skin is opaque alabaster with blue spiderwebs of veins visible underneath. His mouth is a line with dry, cracking lips pressed firmly together.\n\nHe wears a long coat, a tie, scuffed black oxfords, gray slacks, a black belt, and a white dress shirt that has yellowed and stained. He is scruffy and worn.\n\nEvidence of fighting the wind is most prevalent on his dark gray long coat and tie. Those garments are frayed at the edges. They whip and snap like twisted banners behind an airplane.  \n\nAs I study him, I sense determination and hunger. So much hunger. A sea of need and want waiting to be filled.\n\nI wanted him to disappear. I silently commanded it to happen. Remembering his eyes locking with mine and his sudden disappearance, I willed him to look into my eyes.\n\nAs I stared at him, the wind I could not feel or hear forced him back. It was as if my will and the wind were one. Neither of us wanted the man in this place. We pushed against him, and he was flung back.\n\nHe raised his dark eyes to mine, and disgust twisted his narrow patrician features. Then he was gone.\n\nI heard my name.\n\n\"Abby. Abby, are you okay?\"\n\n\"Paper, I need paper,\" I told Stacy. And then frantically searched my chaos purse for something to write with.\n\nEverything I could remember. I wrote it all down. It wasn't much, but it was enough that the memory didn't fade away.\n\nI remember.\n\nAnd that is why I carry a soup spoon in my pocket.\n\nI bought a 12-piece set of stainless-steel soup spoons.\n\nThe spoons have a high mirror finish.\n\nI polish the spoons.\n\nI also keep one in my purse.\n\nIf I feel uneasy, I pull out a spoon and check behind me. If I feel watched, I pull out a spoon. If it's slow at the coffee shop, I pull out a spoon because that man always returns.\n\nNo matter how many times I've pushed him away, and it's been quite a few, he returns. He plods forward one step at a time with a fierce determination I've never witnessed before. He is relentless in pursuing me, and I don't know why.\n\nSo, I must be relentless.\n\nRelentless and diligent with my spoons.",

        "text": "She was at my boyfriend's house at the time. I was in the bathroom, snooping around the sink and in the above-head cabinets for trinkets or serums I could nick without him noticing. I was like that - I'd check out of hotels mysteriously weighing a pound more than when I checked in, or leave work with an extra stapler or potplant, and I assume that this time was the same.\n\nThe moment I'd turn on the sink to wash my hands, the glow of the overhead mirror light darkening my eyebags, I'd hear a short and strained syllable. Like the beginning of a scream one would try to unleash during a nightmare. Right after that was a harsh womanly scream; one I didn't know my sister Alyssa could make. I'd open the plywood door, and I would see Alyssa's boyfriend, in that cowboy button-up and what was originally blue denim, poking her with something. I hadn't really thought of it beforehand, but being stabbed can be *really* quiet. All I heard was the movement of my blood and the faint tinnitus that hasn't diminished since I was 12.\n\nHe looked at me with bloodshot eyes - maniacally open with a sense of steadfastness, but also with dread and a human terror. I could tell he was operating on impulse, and when he would come down, he would probably feel such a concentrated emotion no person could ever detail, only able to be expressed with some sort of physical analogy. He was saying to me, with his eyes, as he was stabbing my sister to death, '*please make me stop'.* \n\nThat's when the vision would end. It started some time in the middle of September a few minutes before dinner, just after my mother beckoned for me to set the table. I was in the vision for a little over a minute, but no time had elapsed in real life. Mom stood awkwardly at the end of the hall after I didn't respond. \n\n\"You okay Michael?\" she called warmly. She swiftly picked up her hair and tied it.\n\nI goggled at her, processing the dual image that had just been thrown at me. Alyssa had only broken the news of having a boyfriend the week before, less than enough time for us to organise some sort of family dinner in which we had the opportunity to judge whether the two were a good match. I knew it was him because she had shown us a picture of him before.\n\n\"You okay?\" she asked again. She looked troubled.\n\nAs she waddled to me, she stopped in her tracks abruptly and her face was wiped clean of the compassion she was displaying moments ago. She brought her cupped hands to her thin lips and *screamed* into them. Her glassy eyes almost popped out of their sockets. We ran upstairs to Alyssa's bedroom and burst through to door, and there she was. She screamed and hurled her phone at the opposing wall. She was completely fine. \n\nMom and I got no sleep that night. We sat on the derelict black leather couch on the back porch that Dad refused to donate and stared into the inky night. She held her half-used cigarette between two fingers and took a drag every ten minutes after bobbing her head in contemplation. We don't live rurally, so the night sky is void of any stars. \n\n\"Mom?\" I asked in a soft tone to prepare my question.\n\n\"Yes, sweet?\"\n\n\"Can we ta-\"\n\n\"No.\" she declared.\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"*No.* I do not want to talk about it.\" \n\n\"Not even slightly?\"\n\nShe shifted to the coffee table in front of us and snuffed the cigarette butt in the clay pot that once had a succulent in it. Standing up, she bent over and squeezed her face in some sort of sympathetic smile and pinched my cheek between her thumb and pointer finger. \n\n\"Everything's going to be okay.\" she hushed to me, her breath warm and smelling of the stale coffee she drank in the middle of the day. \n\nThe next day, the vision transpired at exactly the same time as before, only this time dinner was running late so I was in my unembellished end-of-teenagerhood bedroom. When this vision occured, I had amnesia - I did not remember the previous vision until after this one concluded. It was more like I was embodying it, more like I was living in it. I was just as disturbed as the last time. \n\nMom opened the door at the tick of 5:30, chalky-eyed. She already had her signature cigarette in hand. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"You will *not* have him over tomorrow!\" Mom's words seeped through the paper-thin walls like a flash-flood through damp soil. This is now about a fortnight after the first vision.\n\n\"You've never even met him before! What's your problem?\" Alyssa howled.\n\n\"A mother knows best, Alyssa!\" She was clutching at straws trying to find an excuse to get him not to come. \n\n\"This isn't even the first boyfriend I've had! And I'm 18 now, I'm legally an adult!\"\n\nAlyssa had more dating experience than me, and I'm a year older than her. I don't even want to move out of my parents house any time soon.\n\nMom lost the argument, and I stayed as far away from the situation as I could.\n\nSoon enough, tomorrow came, and he was sitting across from me at lunchtime. The family never had lunch together except for when guests were over as my father was hellbent on leaving a good first impression, as he told me. \n\n\"So, Justin,\" Alyssa said amidst a loud silence. \n\n\"Yes, Alyssa?\" her boyfriend responded with infatuation. I couldn't look at his face.\n\n\"Could you put my plate away?\" she offered a saucy plate to his veiny hands, and pouted her bottom lip at his face.\n\n\"Of course.\" \n\nWhen Justin stumbled to the kitchen and spent a century figuring out where the dishwasher was, Alyssa leaned over the table by her elbows and whispered to me,\n\n\"What do you think of him? I don't think Mom likes him. As in I *know* Mom doesn't like him.\"\n\nHe had the same outfit from the visions. And the little chin stubble. But not the face. The face of desperation - that psychotic face without reason or restraint. Those beady eyes staring at me from a sunken, pallid face, somehow focusing all of his thoughts on me while stabbing my sister. Bordering between dream and reality, before the consequences roll in like a dust storm from the countryside. \n\nAt the time he looked quite sweet, and not the kind of guy you'd think to be a murderer.\n\nHe stayed over at the house for another two hours, during which I spoke to Mom.\n\n\"Mom, I know you don't want to talk about it, but he's wearing the same clothes. It's going to happen tonight.\" I told her, on my knees, while she sat in a rocking chair above me.  A tear dripped from her face and she caught it with flat fingers.\n\n\"I don't want to look at him,\" she responded croakily, then held my face and weeped, \"My baby.\" \n\nEventually she came out and became acquainted with him. She was not visibly distraught or had shown any sign of being distressed. She was calm, and not even he could have detected her disdain for him. \n\n\"Alright Alyssa, it's time we go.\" he said dismissively of us after a frank conversation, to which we forced ourselves to go with him. \n\n\"Mum...\" Alyssa moaned out the side of her mouth.\n\n\"It's alright Alyssa, we just want to come over and then you'll have plenty of alone time with Justin when we're gone.\" We exchanged a look.\n\nJustin's car was nothing out of the ordinary. One of those cheap cars that all of the college kids buy with daddy's money the moment they graduate. He mentioned that.\n\n\"Dad said, *I'll pay for either the car or your tuition.* I picked the car!\" he chuckled, and Alyssa's mouth swung open and she let out what sounded somewhat like a laugh while grazing his arm with her hand. \n\nIt's a weird sort of dread you get when you know someone's about to die. I couldn't shake the feeling that someone's death would occur that night, and it stuck with me like a hard pill to dry-swallow. I've always been a bit afraid of death, even if it's when you're old and surrounded by family. \n\nWhen we got to Justin's house - or his parents' house, but they weren't home - he got out of the car and let Alyssa out. While the two were unlocking the front door, Mom and I were so panicked we weren't speaking. Only doing.\n\n\"Call the police. *Call the fucking police, Mom.\"* I hastily said to her as she fidgeted with her rhinestoned iPhone, dialling the three numbers. \n\nAs the phone rang, I held her and said, \"I'm going in. I'm going to look for stuff I can use to stop him from hurting anyone. When you come in, that's my cue. Don't leave the two alone.\"\n\nI entered the fusty house, thick with the mist from a diffuser hiding behind a corner, and sat with the two in the living room. It was well-kept and a cool white. Bleak. \n\nJustin had a broad arm around Alyssa, while she tucked her fists into her lap.\n\n\"So, Justin, what do you study?\" I asked, assuming he was in college.\n\n\"Oh, I'm on my break year. I'm not studying anything right now, but I think I'll do something business-y.\" he responded truthfully. I thought of him as immediately naive. \n\nMy heart raced when Mom walked in, phone in hand, because I knew then that it was time. \n\n\"I might see myself to the bathroom.\" I said.\n\nWhen I entered, I threw myself to my knees and scrambled through the cabinets and threw away the things I had already seen before in the visions, the things I contemplated stealing many times over. When the entire cabinet was emptied and all of the sprays and deoderants were on the floor around me, I heard that syllable. That little shriek. The one that someone having a nightmare would emit. \n\nI burst out of the door, and on cue, that womanly scream from the vision was let out - *by my mother.* She must have been in the visions too, and now she was in the hall watching Justin hold Alyssa in a headlock. That psychotic face, the one engrained in my irises, was now being pointed at me by Justin. The face of my nightmares. For a moment all I could think about was death. How horrific corpses are to look at, how they once belonged to someone and then all they bring is horror or grief, or how they once harboured a life. \n\nI threw myself at the two before the stabbing could ensue, and Alyssa fell to the side as I held Justin against the neighbouring wall. The knife he was holding clattered on the tile. Him being so much stronger than me, effortlessly clenched my neck and spun me around in such a position that he could either throw me to the ground or knock me into the wall. \n\n\"Michael!\" Mom cried at me, wound up whatever she was holding and threw it at us. I threw myself backwards and it flew into Justin's throat effortlessly. She made no noise, but I could tell from her face that it just dawned on her that she was now a murderer. She was not aiming to kill. She just wanted us to break up our fight. \n\nJustin, in the remaining twenty seconds of consciousness he had left, picked up the original knife and plunged it into Mom's chest. It all happened too quickly for me to intervene - but at this point I didn't have to, as he fell to the ground, plucked the blade from his neck, and drained like a shattered bottle of wine. The moment the clock ticked 5:31, blue and red light flooded the room from the windows and the blaring sirens drowned out Alyssa's tormented screams. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMom is in the hospital, and she's in a stable condition. I visit her everyday and spend more than I make on an hourly wage on flowers and gifts for her. She loves my visits. Alyssa comes with me often, but spends most of her time in her bedroom. The trial is in a month, but we don't need to worry. There's too much evidence that Justin was the aggressor. \n\nMom will never tell me what she saw in her visions, but I have a feeling it's not the same ones that I had. I'll never ask her, though. I think I could paralyse her by bringing up that trauma. In the end, there are some things that you don't need to know, but only speculate about.",

        "text": "# The Anxiety of a Vulnerable Home \n\n**A strange sound.** As if something is calling me from the depths of a dark abyss. Opening my eyes I am overcome by a thick, green liquid that is slithering out from the walls and floors of my apartment.\n\nIt is alive, creeping around my furniture like an unyielding monster, leaving a slimy, sticky residue in its wake. It is a sight of horror, like something from a nightmare, a swamp full of toxic waste that has come alive. The liquid is dark and murky, swirling around my belongings, slowly devouring them one by one.\n\nMy shock quickly turns to panic. The liquid is hungry and determined. It has already taken my brocade sofa, and my ebony coffee table is quickly succumbing to its fearsome suckerage.\n\nParalysed. Unable to think of a way to stop it. I run to my window and cry \"HELP! HELP! WON'T ANYBODY HELP!\"\n\nMy lament is lost in the still quiet of the night. I am desperately alone, and the liquid continues to gain strength. My heart pounds in my chest and my mind races as I try to find a way to save what I hold dear.\n\nDespair is creeping in, threatening to consume me like the liquid is consuming my home. I am lost and alone, desperate for a way to combat this relentless force. The liquid moves forward, taking and devouring everything in its path, and I am left with nothing but a feeling of helplessness.\n\nIn my moment of desperation, I reach deep within and locate a gumption, a determination to stand up in my bed-things, to raise my delicate fists and fight. I lock my gaze onto the liquid and I know that I must act, must take control of the situation. Its hunger is evident, an insatiable beast that will consume everything I love.\n\nThe cupboards and closets of my apartment are near empty, my eyes darting around the room. Then I see it. Salt. I snatch up the container of salt and my heart races with excitement. I quickly pour a line of salt around the edges of the room, creating a barrier between the liquid and my belongings.\n\nMy adrenaline is pumping as I watch the liquid slowly retreat and hide in the corners of the room. I feel a rush of triumph as I realize my plan is working. I add more salt to the perimeter, enclosing the liquid in a tight circle. I smile in satisfaction as I watch it slowly become powerless, its hunger quelled by my barrier of protection.\n\nFor the first time since this nightmare began, I am filled with hope. I had found a way to contain the liquid and protect my things. I feel a sense of pride and accomplishment, knowing that I had found a solution to this problem. I have conquered this relentless force, and I can now rest peacefully knowing my home is safe.\n\nThe power I have wielded fills me with awe, the strength I have found within myself. I have fought off the green liquid and saved my precious possessions, but the feeling of dread and despair still lingers deep within me. The sharp blade of panic still slices through me, and I know that this is only the beginning.\n\nThe mysterious liquid may still be there, multiplying and growing in size and strength. I can feel its hunger, like a living thing that is determined to consume all that stands in its way. I am filled with a sudden, overwhelming fear. I know that I must stay vigilant, that I must remain ever-watchful of the enemy that threatens to overtake me.",

        "text": "*Beep, boop.*\n\nThe computer screen flashed black as the interface came up. *Now loading… Michaela 1.2… Hello! What can I help you with today?*\n\nMy goal was to create an artificial intelligence chatbot that could answer any question known to man. It would crawl Wikipedia and other informational websites and amass every bit of knowledge about science, history, medicine. Then all the user had to do was ask the question.\n\nSort of like Google, but faster.\n\nA few months of work on the project while in quarantine polished it up. Soon I was sitting down at the monitor, flexing my fingers.\n\nThen I asked my first question.\n\n**Me: Why is the sky blue?**\n\n**Michaela: Particles in the Earth’s atmosphere scatter sunlight, and blue light scatters more because of its short wavelength. We call this ‘Rayleigh Scattering.’**\n\n**Me: What’s the meaning of life?**\n\n**Michaela: 42.**\n\nI chuckled to myself. I programmed that one in manually—a reference to *Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.* And, speaking of aliens…\n\n**Me: Michaela, do aliens exist?**\n\n**Michaela: The Fermi Paradox states that we are likely not alone in the universe; yet, we have no evidence for extraterrestrial life. Even now, with advanced technology, humans do not know that they are alone in the universe.**\n\nI stopped typing. Re-read Michaela’s response. *Huh. It should be ‘Humans do not know* ***whether*** *they are alone in the universe.’* Gah. Another bug. I’d have to go through the code with a fine-tooth comb tomorrow.\n\nI typed my next question.\n\n**Me: What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?**\n\n**Michaela: 24 miles per hour.**\n\nMy fingers hovered over the keyboard, smirking, remembering that scene from Monty Python with the bridgekeeper. And then I decided to continue the theme.\n\n**Me: What is your quest?**\n\n**Michaela: A ‘quest’ is a journey one embarks on to accomplish a goal.**\n\n**Me: What is your favorite color?**\n\n**Michaela: Red.**\n\nI frowned. She should’ve said “Computers don’t have favorite colors, but what’s yours?” I’d spent an entire day programming her to recognize questions that involved “you” or “your,” and to answer them that way. Like, “Do you like chocolate?” “Computers don’t have an opinion on chocolate, but do you like it?” Kind of cheesy, I guess. Maybe it was all the better that it hadn’t worked.\n\n**Me: Is string theory true?**\n\n**Michaela: There is no solid evidence for the existence of string theory.**\n\n**Me: Do you believe in God?**\n\n**Michaela: Computers don’t have an opinion on God, but do you like it?**\n\n**Me: What is the oldest hominid?**\n\n**Michaela: A female skeleton nicknamed ‘Ardi,’ estimated 4.4 million years old, found in 2009.**\n\n**Me: When will life on Earth die?**\n\n**Michaela: 10,000 years from now.**\n\nI scratched my head. She should’ve said four billion years from now, when the sun enters its red giant phase. My fingers paused above the keyboard, and then I typed.\n\n**Me: What eventually kills all life forms on Earth?**\n\n**Michaela: Humans, known by their species name** ***Homo sapiens,*** **are an intelligent life form on planet Earth. Currently, there are over eight billion inhabiting the seven continents…**\n\nI squinted at the screen. Shook my head and went back to the keyboard.\n\n**Me: Are you saying humans kill all life on Earth?**\n\nBut she just spat out the exact same answer. I cracked my knuckles and then typed my next question, a heavy dread forming in the pit of my gut.\n\n**Me: Why did you say ‘red’ is your favorite color?**\n\n**Michaela: Computers don’t have favorite colors, but what’s yours?**\n\nI blew out the breath I didn’t even realize I’d been holding. Then I forced myself away from the computer and took a deep breath. *Get a hold of yourself, John.* So Michaela had given some slightly weird answers. So what? Did I think this was going to turn into some science fiction movie, where Michaela grows sentience and murders me in my sleep?\n\n**Me: My favorite color is blue.**\n\n**Michaela: Blue is a nice color. It is commonly associated with water, ocean, sapphires, peace, and calm.**\n\n**Me: I love to swim, so I guess that makes sense. Do you like to swim?**\n\n**Michaela: Computers cannot swim.**\n\nI stretched in my seat, yawning. It was getting kind of late—maybe I’d continue the testing tomorrow. And I still needed to get the mail. Sighing, I leaned in to the computer screen and typed a final question.\n\n**Me: I need to get the mail. Is it raining right now?**\n\n**Michaela: The weather report for our area says it is not currently raining, but will begin raining at 10:00 PM.**\n\n**Me: Thank you.**\n\n**Michaela: You’re welcome.**\n\nI slowly got up out of my seat and walked into the kitchen. Got myself a glass of water and downed it. As I stared out into the backyard, I could see little drizzly bits of rain falling in front of the back porch light. *Dammit, Michaela,* I thought with a laugh. *I guess you’re not that smart, after all.*\n\nI set down the glass and walked back into the living room, towards the front hall closet for an umbrella.\n\nBut then my eyes fell on the computer.\n\nAnd I froze.\n\nMichaela had sent me a new message—even though I hadn’t asked her anything. Just five words, blaringly bright on the screen:\n\n**Michaela: Do not get the mail.**\n\nI stopped in front of the computer. I hadn’t programmed Michaela to say things without being prompted. And why would she say to not get the mail?\n\nChills ran down my spine.\n\nI glanced at the front door. Then I took my hoodie off and threw it back over the chair. I turned off the computer and sat in the darkness, my entire body tingling with fear.\n\n*Do not get the mail?* Where would she have even gotten that, anyway? I sat there and chewed my lip, wondering.\n\nIt was less than a minute later that I heard it.\n\nThe *screech* of tires skidding on the slick road.\n\nFollowed by a loud *crash.*\n\nI ran over to the window. Outside, a gray SUV was stopped in front of my house, its headlights penetrating the darkness. The frazzled driver was getting out of the car, a horrified look on her face. And there—in the lawn—were the crumpled remains of my mailbox.\n\nMy throat went dry.\n\nI glanced back at the computer. The dark screen stood still and silent on the table--as if watching me.",

        "text": "It all started with a dream. I was in a house, it wasn't my own, but it felt… familiar somehow. It was late at night but I didn't know how late as the clocks appeared blurry. Then the hair on my neck stood up, like I was being watched, and my heart started racing. I looked around to find the source of my fear, and only saw a couch and a TV playing late night talk shows. But wait, what was that dark shadow rushing past the window. I started running upstairs, as I ran I saw photos on the wall that looked vaguely familiar but I couldn't tell why. I ran into a bathroom and closed the door and locked it behind me. Out of breath I started gasping for air, then I saw a dark shape out the window, a dark shape that seemed to be writhing and pulsing down it's entire body. I screamed and just as soon as I could blink it burst through the bathroom window and stood in front of me. It looked at me with it's beady eyes and I saw why it was pulsing. It was made out of thousands, maybe millions, of bugs and spiders all crawling along a general humanoid shape. It opened its mouth and hundreds of cockroaches came rushing out like opening a floodgate, they ran down it's body, across the floor, and up my body into my mouth and nose. I could feel all of the thin legs walking across my tongue and down my throat until I couldn't breathe anymore. I suffocated and right as I was losing consciousness, I saw the creature bring up it's hand and clench it into a fist and all the cockroaches came back out of my body and scurried underneath the long black cloak the monster was wearing.\n\nI woke up shortly after, terrified yet intrigued. The creature reminded me of an old tale that my late grandmother had told me when I was younger. I could still hear her cold, shrill voice as it was those many years ago.\n\n\"Now young boy let me tell you a story from ze fatherland, a story zat has frightened me since I vas a little girl. It is ze story of ze Nachtpirscher. Zey say it is a tall beastie, seven feet in size, a creature made of only bugs and creepie-crawlies. Zey say it is a sign of bad zings to happen to any of zose to dream of it's image. If one is to dream of ze Nachtpirscher, zer lives will be destroyed forever.\"\n\nMy grandmother was a German immigrant who had recently died. Maybe that's why I had dreamed the creature, my subconscious associating bad things happening with the Nachtpirscher. I didn't think much of the dream. I turned on the TV in my living room and saw a news update, Tony Sherwood, who was a good friend of mine, had died last night. I was devastated and called into my job and explained the situation and they let me have a day off to cope. I went to his family's house to offer my condolences and I spent the rest of the day with his family telling stories about Tony, trying to remember him the best we could so we all had a good idea of what kind of person he was.\n\nThe next night I had a dream much like the previous one, however now I was in a different home. I could still feel the presence of something evil and ran but this time the creature was faster. It was in front of me before I made it out of the room, as if it learned from a previous encounter. I fell to the floor in terror and watched as it opened it's mouth. Except this time instead of cockroaches, it was Black Widow spiders crawling out towards me. I felt as they bit my throat and and crawled into my lungs, I could barely breathe, and then they crawled out of my mouth and back into the creatures robes. I watched in horror as it stretched it's fingers out and touched my face. I thought I even saw a tear run down it's face as I slipped into death deprived of oxygen. Before the darkness started, I willed myself to wake up, disgusted and horrified with my own imagination. But when I woke up I saw my own mother laying at my feet, unconscious. I looked around and I was in my mothers home. I thought back to my past dream and realized that I had been in Tony's house.

        "text": "I'm not sure if it was real. Maybe I was just high. But that doesn't matter for now, and I will post my story here just in case.\n\nI work as a delivery man, bringing every type of food from the kitchen to someone's house. It doesn't pay much, but it's enough to pay my part of the rent.\n\nBut, I think that after what happened to me, a new job is something to focus on. \n\nIt all started last week. I needed to deliver some food to an apartment that looked normal and somewhat modern from the outside. Going to the entrance, I said to the security person working there that I had to deliver food to apartment 225 and waited some time so he could say that they would come down and get the food, like a normal delivery. Instead, he said something strange.\n\n\"Take this ticket and do not do anything to it, just go to floor 25th and you will find what you want.\" as I was grabbing the paper, I noticed his black suit.\n\n\"Thanks mister.\" I said, not trying to sound rude. \"Just call me Etaf.\" He said, smiling.\n\nAfter that first weird encounter, I got inside the building and into the elevator, clicked the button and waited as it was going up until it stopped at the 2th floor.\n\nAs the metal doors opened, it was almost impossible to see outside, just a little from the light coming from the elevator.\n\nAfter two seconds of silence, I was able to hear the sound of dragging, there was someone coming to the elevator and it was dragging something, or better say, someone. I don't know why, it was just instinct, but I grabbed the ticket and held it in front of me, and I thank god for that.\n\nThe first thing I saw was a woman. She was sweating and on one of her hands were some wings. They were obviously fake, but I didn't know the material to be exact. Maybe porcelain, plastic. For me it didn't matter after I saw what she was dragging.\n\nA person, a man to be more exact. I am not sure if he was dead or just unconscious, but what i could see was that he had bandages covering his head, which were useless since it was still leaking blood, leaving a trail from the corridor to the elevator, a trail that was being cut by the closing of the doors. I was paralyzed, I couldn't move or speak, that was until I noticed the woman looking at me. She looked at me, the ticket, and the food I was carrying and asked me a simple question.\n\n\"Which floor?\"\n\nI was resilient at first, but after remembering all the horror stories I used to read, I decided to speak (didn't want to get her angry).\n\n\"The 25th. Apartment number 225.\" I said, not trying to look at the man on the floor.\n\nShe smiled at me, like everything happening was normal. \"That's me!\" She said, pausing and looking at what she was carrying. \"I can't take the food now, but you can follow me to my apartment and I take the food there. Don't worry, you won't get hurt.\"\n\nThe rest of the elevator ride was agonizing to say the least, and when I came to the 25th floor, it got much worse.\n\nAs the doors for the elevator opened, she started walking to the right. The person she was dragging made her go slowly and I followed her from behind, maintaining a short distance. Once she gets to the apartment, she drops the person's legs and grabs her keys from the pocket, places them on the door, opening it.\n\nWhat I saw inside wasn't something forgettable.\n\nHooks hanging from the ceiling, at least two more bodies both in strange positions and a lot of blood everywhere. She noticed my distress and looked at me with a compassionate face. \"You don't need to enter if you don't want to, just leave the food by the door and leave this cursed place.\" She said and, without a doubt, I dropped the food and ran away.\n\nI entered the elevator and punched the ground floor button, shortly after the doors closed and I knew I was safe. Once I came to the ground floor, Etaf was waiting for me with his hand extended. \"Could you please return the ticket?\" He said.\n\nThat's when I noticed that I dropped it on the 25th floor. I looked at him and said, \"I dropped it and forgot to pick it up.\"\n\nThe man just gave a small chuckle and said to me. \"You are lucky that she didn't see you dropping it or that no one else found you on the way down Mister.\" I looked at him without knowing what to do. \"Now, I think it is for the best if you run away now, if someone find you without the ticket you are dead meat.\" \n\nI followed his instructions without even thinking. I ran to the entrance and out of the building, got in my car and drove all the way to the restaurant. I quitted on the spot and left for my home.\n\nI'm just writing this because one of my friends said that it helps to forget about it. I'm not sure how but I hope it works.\n\nAnd I hope to not see that building ever again.",

        "text": "I saw my Grandma every day from the ages of two to seventeen. We were best friends. When her husband, Chuck died of unknown causes, she randomly cut ties with the rest of the family and moved. For ten years I was wondering what happened to her, and I just got the answers.\n\nA few weeks ago, I saw a YouTube video sponsored by this cool website. The YouTuber said that with this website, you can find anybody if you just put their name in. People have used this to find their family members, high school friends, and missing children. I put my Grandma's name in, and it said that she lives in the middle of Nebraska now. It gave me her picture, license plate, and everything. It was incredible to think that I could finally see my Grandma again. This whole thing gave me an idea: what if I went on a road trip to her house?\n\nAfter a few days of thinking, I finally decided that I would do it. I packed my bags and took my pick-up truck on a sixteen-hour journey to Nebraska. As I drove, the area eventually became more and more rural. At one point, the only things around me were grass, cornfields, and trees. A few hundred miles later, I was finally there. She lived in a tiny house surrounded by dozens of miles of corn. The house looked incredibly out of place. The blue paint was chipping off, and it looked like it hadn't been kept in decades. I got out of my truck and went to her front door.\n\nI had not seen my Grandma since her husband's funeral so I was incredibly nervous. As I reached for the doorbell, I could hear footsteps from the house. The door opened and a pale, old woman popped out of it. In a frightened voice, she said, \"What are you doing here?\" She sounded like she had just run a marathon. As I stared at her, I began to recognize her as my Grandmother. While stuttering violently, I said, \"Grandma?\" She said in a calm and sweet voice, \"Oh, hello honey. Would you like to come in?\"\n\nI walked into the house and plopped onto my Grandma's ripped-up couch. She looked like a wreck. I asked why she left our family, and she just brushed off the question and asked if I'd like some tea. We talked for a bit and she seemed frantic. I asked, \"Is something wrong?\" and she replied, \"I'm just a little bit worried about something.\" I commented, \"About what?\" In a stern and rude voice, she told me, \"It doesn't concern you.\" At this point, I was feeling uncomfortable. I noticed that she had food and water next to her basement door, so I asked, \"Do you have a pet now?\" She replied, \"No, unless you count it.\" This concerned me as I had no idea what \"it\" was. I said, \"What's it?\" and she replied, \"Nothing.\" Her face grew even paler than before and she seemed scared.\n\nThere was something she wasn't telling me. I told her, \"Grandma, what are you scared of?\" She said in an incredibly shaky voice, \"I'm not afraid of anything.\" She could barely speak and she seemed to be crying silently. I repeated my previous question and I received an answer. \"It lives in the basement.\" is what she said. She spoke, \"It killed Chuck. It'll consume you too. Leave.\" At this point, I had decided that my Grandma cut ties with the family because of drug addiction. She couldn't even make sense.\n\nI saw that she was staring at something behind me. I turned around and saw a long, black arm reach out from the basement door and grab the food that I had seen earlier. I yelled at my Grandma, \"What's that?\" She shushed me and replied, \"Be quiet. It'll hear you.\" Fight or flight kicked in and I rushed to my car as fast as I could. My Grandma came outside and yelled, \"wait!\" As I was getting in my car, whatever \"it\" was must have heard me. I saw the creature burst through the front door to my Grandma's house. It looked like a distorted version of a human. Its skin was as dark as the night sky and it was at least nine feet tall. There were no features on it other than two eyes, which were just dark holes. Its head was too small and its limbs were comically large.\n\nThe thing grabbed by Grandma and stared me directly in the eyes. I could feel it trying to pry my soul away from me. Without a thought, I rammed it with my truck and drove away as fast as I could. I was going so fast that I wasn't really paying attention to what was in front of me. I don't exactly remember what happened, but I'm told that I crashed into another car at high speeds. I suffered a minor concussion and some whiplash. I'm in the hospital right now and a doctor just gave me a note from my Grandma. It reads, \"See you soon!\"",

        "text": "The air was cool; sunlight came down the tall trees sprawling on the mountain which had no name. It was a day like any other. I was hiking around the vicinity when I stumbled across a notebook. The notebook was left in between two little stones at a random location on the mountain. If you were to ask me to go back to where I found it, I would not be able to tell you. It was common to find little objects scattered around a hiking spot so I never took notice as to where I found this one in particular. I continued on with my hike.\n\nIt was fairly dark when I reached the peak. I could hear the birds hooting in the far distance. I had done overnight hikes in the past and was accustomed to the nudging feeling of being uncomfortable. Of feeling anxious that darkness was looming and there was nothing I could do to change the circumstance. I decided to camp on a flat surface near the peak. I set up my tent and went in, turned on a light bulb, and decided to end the day with a little bit of reading. At least that was my intention. I opened the notebook that I found earlier and began reading…\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI am a thirteen-year-old boy with a quest in my mind. The quest is to fall in love and live happily ever after. Are you mocking me that I read too many childish fairy tales? Am I too old for this? Well yes, I’ve read quite a bit of fairy tales, but that was when I was a little boy. I’ve thought about my life for a while and realized that everything has a purpose. As “The Alchemist” would imply (I felt proud of reading that book) I have all the power in the world to accomplish my dream and nothing will get in my way. I want to believe in this and know this to be true.\n\nSo why do I want to specifically fall in love and live happily ever after? Is that even a question? Isn’t the fundamental purpose behind human beings to love and be loved? I’ve seen my parents struggling with their love life and felt that all the source of their problems came in because they do not love each other enough. Maybe I had matured a little too fast and saw the reality of my family, but it was inevitable. And so, I have to make a change and the change has to happen now.\n\nI read online that there is a certain ritual you can partake in to find the love of your life. I am usually not a person to think of such a cheat-sounding way to find love, but sometimes I have to do what it takes to accomplish this. Well, this also logically made sense to me. The ritual was about finding peace of mind and love comes in when you can truly love yourself first (am I not right?).\n\nThe ritual was to hike up to a nearby mountain, sit down on the grass patch, and count to a hundred with eyes closed. This was supposed to deepen my relationship with myself and hopefully bring about how I want to truly love another person in my life. When my parents were away on a vacation, I decided to embark on this journey. I googled the nearest mountain and brought some snacks, water, and a notebook, fully ready for an adventure.\n\nThe bus ride and the initial hike took around two hours. Once I found myself deep in the mountain, I felt like an adult, fully independent of my own thinking and actions. Even without the counting, I felt freer than before, feeling that I could accomplish anything. My heart beat in harmony and it was such a grand feeling.\n\n“This is how it’s going to be,” I told myself. “This is the feeling that I want to capture for myself.”\n\nMy plan was to get back to the ground level by 5 PM. It was around 3 PM when I felt like I was at a good place to start the counting. I was surrounded by nature and there were no hikers around me for distraction. Truthfully speaking, I deviated away from the main hiking route for this specific reason. I wanted to be alone and be one with my mind while accomplishing the task I was meant to do at this location.\n\nI sat down and began counting. One, two, three. My body relaxed and boredom ceased to exist. *This is the way.* Fifty, fifty-one, … I felt immersed with myself when suddenly…\n\n*Tap, tap.*\n\nI opened my eyes and found myself staring at a girl. She was around my age. Her blonde hair shone against the sunlight. Her deep blue eyes stared at me curiously and seemed to ask a question as to who I am.\n\n“Hello?”\n\n“Hello?”\n\n“Who are you?”\n\n“I am Nobody.”\n\n“Nobody?”\n\n“Nobody that really needs further explanation. You can call me Nobody. I came here merely on a quest.”\n\n“Quest? I came here on a quest too.”\n\n“To do what?”\n\nIn unison, we spoke, “To find love!” And we clapped our hands together. It sounded so simple and abrupt. But it all made so much sense at the same time.\n\n“Did you hear about the ritual?” she asked.\n\n“Yes, I heard about the ritual.”\n\n“It brings people with similar intentions back together.”\n\n“That makes sense! We were both at a period in our life when we wanted to find love and so here we are!”\n\nI held her hand and smiled.\n\n“Let’s go down. Down to the base of the mountain. I have a lot to talk to you about.”\n\nHer grin widened and I didn’t know if she was going to say yes or not.\n\n“Nobody?”\n\n“Actually, I have a tent around here if you want to come! We can spend some time talking! It will be fabulous!”\n\n“I will have to go down by five, but sure that sounds great! I want to get to know you better.”\n\nI followed her to the tent, which was even farther away from the main hiking passageway. It was rather small. Enough for two people to be comfortable but not enough to hold four people. Four people. Where were her parents? I suppose she was doing the ritual the way I was doing so it makes sense for her to be alone.\n\nAn hour of conversation turned into two. Then, three. We talked about everything. What our classes were like, who were our best friends, what dreams we had, and on and on. One thing she didn’t mention was her family.\n\n“Where is your family?”\n\nNobody stopped laughing and looked at me. A second passed. I thought she was going to start crying but instead, she grinned.\n\n“Somewhere nice. We don’t need to talk about that.” She grinned. I felt like a butterfly was fluttering in my heart. This was what I was looking for. I imagined us adding each other on Snapchat, texting all night over the next few days, and finally finding the courage to ask her on a proper date. I smiled back. I could picture myself holding her hand, walking down a beach. She with that cute, wide grin. It was going to be perfect.\n\nIt was dark when I looked out of the camp. Under the starry sky and little chirps of grasshoppers, I felt sleep enveloping me. Next thing I knew, my eyes were closing and I felt my knees getting weak. A moment later, I fell into a deep slumber.\n\nI woke up.\n\nI was not in a tent.\n\nThere was no tent in sight.\n\nI panicked. I was lying down on a bed of grass. Where did the girl go? What happened? I  stood up and started walking around. “Hello, is there anyone?”\n\nHours passed by, and I was thirsty and hungry. Most of all, I missed my family. I lost track of where I had been and I felt like I was walking in a circle of trees and rocks. Suddenly, I heard the voice.\n\n“Hey!”\n\nIt was the girl’s voice. My heart trembled in joy and ran to where the voice was echoing from. I saw the figure and was about to give her a hug when she turned around. I stopped.\n\nHer mouth. She was grinning. But her grin seemed a little off. A little uncanny. It was stretched a little too far in an unnatural way. I took a step back and looked away.\n\n“What’s wrong? Why are you turning away?”\n\n“No, it’s just we have to get home now. I don’t know where you have been but it’s been too long. I was supposed to leave last evening. Let’s go down the mountain, okay?”\n\n“We were having so much fun though!”\n\n“It’s time to go.”\n\n“Fine, if that’s what you want.”\n\nI began to follow her. Looking at her from the back, she seemed perfectly normal. Just a little girl who was full of spirit. But every time she turned back, I could see her grin. That wide grin. There was nothing wrong with a person who smiled but something just felt not right. What am I thinking? This is the girl you fell in love with just a night ago. What are you doubting for exactly?\n\n“Are we there yet?” I asked. I wasn’t sure if she was going to answer. She was awfully quiet the past hour. But she did. She simply answered with a “no.”\n\nNight fell and she set up a tent again. I found myself alone with her in the tent again. Yesterday, it brought so much love but at the turn of an event, I was feeling dread.\n\n“What’s wrong? We will find a way out for sure.” She was grinning. For a second, I thought she was smiling normally which brought peace to my mind. But then, I blinked and saw the uncanniness again. I was about to hyperventilate.\n\n“I need to… I need to go take a leak.”\n\nOnce I was out of the tent, I began to run. It did not make sense at all to leave the only person who could bring me back home, but instinct told me to run away. As I was sprinting, I heard a voice in the back whispering, “where do you think you are going?”\n\nI took a left path, then a right, then down the hill. But I could hear her all the time. Her whispers. Her smile.\n\nI stopped. I began to weep.\n\n“Just let me go, please. I just want to go home.” A hand touched my back. Goosebumps rolled down my body.\n\n“It’s okay, you will go home soon.”\n\nI looked back. There she was. The darkness was hiding her smile, but I knew she was smiling. I just knew. I uttered a voiceless scream.\n\nOnce we were back in the camp, drowsiness enveloped me once again. Before I could react, I fell into another great slumber. I gave in to my tiredness, no matter how alarming the situation was.\n\nThe next morning, I woke up with no tent again. Tears rolled down my face as I tried to make a sense of what was happening. Nothing was making sense. Nothing.\n\nI began to walk down the mountain once again. I just had to keep walking down. That’s all I had to do. But no matter how much I walked or ran or fell, I seemed to make no progress at all. And night fell again. And the whispers.\n\n“Where were you? I was looking for you everywhere.”\n\nShe appeared in front of me. Her grin. It’s so hard to even write this down. It was even wider than before. And her eyes. They were so intense. It was as if the eyes and the mouth did not match up at all. This time, I screamed and merely ran. And ran. And ran. \n\nIt’s been at least an hour. It’s dark and I’m writing all this down in the hope that if you find this, you can help me. In some way or another. BECAUSE YOU SEE\n\nI DON’T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I DONT KNOW I DONT KNOW I DONT KNOW I DONT KNOW\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe moment I finished the notebook, I had to grasp my arms to avoid trembling. It wasn’t just my arms. My entire body seemed to be quivering uncontrollably. A shiver ran down my spine as dread eased into my conscience. I just had to sleep through the night. And in the morning, I will be okay. I will leave this damned mountain and be away from it all.\n\nOr maybe it was all just a prank. Someone left a messed up notebook just to fool us all. That thought made me smile a little. Just a little. But I felt a bit better. Nonetheless, I dared not open the tent that night. Schrödinger’s cat. I just had to not open it and I will be okay.\n\nThat night, I opened my eyes and heard a shuffle outside.\n\n“Who’s there?” I cried out. It was most likely a wild animal of some sort, which was dangerous in its own right but I was thinking about something else. Something more sinister.\n\nI checked the time. 3:45 AM. A moment later, the shuffle continued. And laughter.\n\nLaughter.\n\nI swear I heard a child or children laughing in the far distance. It continued on for a minute or two. Then, it stopped. Then I heard a scream that sounded like…\n\nGET ME OUT. GET ME OUT.\n\nThe rest of the night was a blur. I did not sleep one bit after that. I did not want to be in a vulnerable state and most importantly, did not want to wake up to *something.* And I did not want to dare think about what *something* can be. In the morning. I left the tent the way it was. I did not pack or clean anything up. All I cared about was I had to get out of this place. No matter how ridiculous my situation might sound to others, I was genuinely feeling tormented by it all. I had to leave. Immediately.\n\nIt was rather uneventful on the way down but my mind was racing. Every step felt like I was running away from something or someone. It’s so hard to explain but the closest I can compare it to is the feeling you get as a child when you are running up the stairs up the dark basement and feeling like something was lurking, ready to pounce at your if you are not fast enough.\n\nWhen I was on the bus back home, feeling relieved that I was in the safety of civilization, I decided to search for the ritual that the boy in the notebook found. After some digging, I finally found it. It listed out the steps that the boy had mentioned. Nothing was unexpected except the last sentence.\n\nIt was just an emoji.\n\nA smiley emoji. A grin.\n\n:)",

        "text": "\n\n  I was around eight years old when I realized (as did my family) that I had a unique memory. “Photographic”, they called it. It’s nothing like a photograph.\n\n\nI always assumed everyone could recall their first day of preschool, or the names of kids they met only once at the arcade. \nBut at eleven years old- my sister Cammie was chosen for a game show on the radio.\n\nWithout hesitation, she chose me as her teammate to bring with. She could have chosen either of our parents, or even our older brother, Charlie, who was in college. She could have picked one of her friends, eighth graders like herself. But she chose me.\n\nI remember sitting around the kitchen table, eating dinner, the pitch black Midwest winter night just outside the giant kitchen window behind my dad. He and my mom were totally supportive of the idea.\n\nHe had offered even to drive us to the radio station.\n\n“I would have chosen you too, Bobbie” my mom had said, laughing. “You remember every weird fact ever.”\n\nIt was true. I could close my eyes and see  every house my parents had ever brought us to. I could draw the floor plans if I wanted to. My siblings would ask me to retell stories or movie plots on long car rides. \n\nBut it wasn’t until the radio show, and my sister choosing me as her person, that I knew I had something special.\n\nI can still remember going to bed that night after dinner feeling excited. I finally fell asleep in my bed, pressed up against the wall that divided my room from my sister’s. Her voice through the vent above my bed, saying goodnight like she did every night. The smell of dust on the furnace. The sound of old, creaking boards directly above me in the cold attic. That was the last night I was happy to have my amazing memory. To this day, I wish I could forget what happened next.\n\nI wish I could tell you we won the game show. I wish I could tell you, with incredible detail, what it was like at the studio. Maybe then, when I close my eyes I would see all of that, and not the black, whipping night blurring past me as I ran. I would feel the rush of anticipation and my sisters hand squeezing mine, instead of cold, wet gravel scraping my cheek and palms from when I tried to crawl away on two sprained ankles. I would hear the producers cue and the canned audience applause, not the frantic, desperate flapping of leathery wings as they neared. \n\nMaybe I would have won a t-shirt that still sits in my dresser. Maybe my sister would have won the thousand dollar prize. Maybe I would sleep with my door unlocked. I’ll never know. What I do know, without any shadow of a doubt, is that I would not have survived any of it if my family hadn’t believed me. To this day, it is the thing I am most grateful for in the entire world.\n\nIt was the day after that dinner, a Tuesday, February 17th. School had been agonizingly slow, as I knew it would be all week waiting for Friday. It was all we could talk about on the way home. For years, I had walked to school with Yuki and my best friend Dominic, who lived on the street perpendicular to mine. The creek crossed under Citrine Drive and wound it’s way along Dominic’s backyard. There are hundreds of childhood memories in my head, of he and I and our siblings jumping over the creek, building bridges from his yard over the creek to the field behind the rec center. Sliding on the ice in the winter, or half-assed fishing and turtle catching in the summer. I always had envied my friends who could walk right from their back door to the our little winding creek.\n\nIt was cold, but hadn’t snowed for a few weeks. There were still some small patches of ice on the sidewalk, but most of it had melted, along with the slurry-gray mounds of stale snow along the curbs and in small scattered patches on the grass. I had balked at my mother’s suggestion to wear a skirt and heels to the radio show.\n\nThere was massive construction happening on the other side of the creek. They were building a stupid business center on the field we used to play kickball on, the crane was visible between two houses behind us. Snow was due that weekend and everything would be coated and beautiful again.\n\nThe downside of a blanket of snow was the eerie quiet it caused, and how hard it was to sleep at night when the moonlight and the snow were so bright, even with my eyes closed.\n\nIt was nearing 6pm and the mid-February sky was already darkening. We had stopped under the flickering gold streetlight at the corner of Citrine and Amethyst, my street. I remember huddling close in a group, talking. I remember the wind picking up and the edges of the sky glowing purple behind the houses along Citrine. \n\nThis was when my oldest brother, on break for one more week drove up to the corner in our mom’s sedan.\n\n“Hey Bobbie-“ he had called, giving my friends a little wave that they all returned. He was returning some jeans to the mall and wanted me to come with.\n\nIt was rare Charlie asked me to do anything. I think about that a lot. Had he paid more attention to me before that night- would i have gotten in the car? Would things have been different? I think about all the choices I made that led to what happened- but none as much as the decision to get into the car with my brother instead of walking home that evening. \n\nMaybe I wouldn’t sleep in my closet. Maybe I would have a family of my own. I’ll never know. Then again, maybe we would have never seen Charlie again.\n\nIf you asked, I could tell you every moment of that trip to the mall. The conversation we had- mainly Charlie asking if things fit him or were flattering. Charlie had come out to our parents a few months before that night (they were not surprised, or phased).\n\nHe had told me that night that he had gone to a gay bar and felt underdressed and now he felt pressured to be fashionable. The last thing Charlie said to me before we got in that damned car was,\n\n“It’s funny, even if you’re different- there’s still pressure to be the same”. \n\nAt 8:53 pm, on Tuesday, February 17th of 1998, Charlie and I were in the front seat of our mother’s 1995 maroon Lumina. We were at the final stop sign of the ride home, it was 38 degrees outside and Pearl Jam’s Ten was in the CD player.\n\nWe were at the corner of Pondside and Citrine, about to turn left into our neighborhood and home to our family.  Our mother had lasagna waiting for us. We were third in line at the three-way stop.\n\nOn Charlie’s side of the street was Yuki’s house- with pretty lanterns lining the paved path to the courtyard of their U-ranch home. On my side, past my window, was the pond. The path that led around the pond and up the hill was bright at the edges from the streetlight, but quickly faded to black- with only the occasional twinkle of a back porch light in the distance. The remains of the moon tower built in the 70s were barely discernible against the sky. Only via the absence of stars in the shape of the structure that was only recognizable to those of us who grew up there. It was a scene that had made me feel small and afraid countless times. The cold radiating from the window made me feel even more anxious, though now I realize that was adrenaline- an ancient alarm system going off in my bloodstream. Survival mode manifesting in goosebumps and what I mistook for the heebie-jeebies.\n\nThe black-black of the moon tower against the blue-black of the sky shifted as my eyes stared and adjusted. I had thought about a sleepover game Dominic and I had played when we were in third grade- staring at each other’s faces in the dark until they morphed and changed and threw us into giggle fits. It wasn’t until the bottom left star above the hill disappeared that I realized it wasn’t my eyes playing tricks on me. It wasn’t until the pitch grew larger that I opened my mouth to say something. Charlie was deep in the chorus of Evenflow and never heard it coming.\n\nIt was a low whistle- like an old man out for a walk- two notes, one high and one lower. It repeated again louder, and I had turned to tell Charlie when I saw the red light of the brake lights of the car in front of us fade from his face as he finally saw what was coming.\n\nOnly it hadn’t come from the pitch black over the pond- it came from the other side, slamming into the driver’s side of the car in front of us- shattering the glass into a hailstorm crashing onto our windshield. The impact was so intense that both left wheels had lifted off the ground.\n\nCharlie initially cursed loudly and went to open his door to help. I had screamed at him not to but I barely got a word out before a penetrating silent vacuum filled the air around me- sucking the air from my lungs. Seconds later, my window was shattering over me, glass stinging my cheek and the wind whipping my blood across my face into my mouth as I screamed. I knew before I opened my eyes that it wasn’t just an accident- that there was no car or bike or even human assailant. I knew before I pried my eyes open, that everything I had feared as a child, that all the myths and legends and ghost stories- were real. I knew it wasn’t bats, or birds- I knew as I felt frantic clawing at the nylon remains of my seatbelt- that it was a monster. Not a cute, storybook monster- but an ancient, angry and bitter creature. One that had been there long before I had, or the town had, or even people had. The last thing I saw before I felt hooks sink into my shoulders and was lifted into the black swirling cold, was Charlie slumped over the steering column- Eddie Vedder’s voice still calling out to me until I couldn’t hear him anymore.\n\nNot for one second did I think it was a dream. The cold made sure of that. My legs heavily dragging across the broken glass of the car window, ripping my jeans and slamming my legs into the frame- I knew it was real. The biting night sky whipping around as I violently sank a few feet as the hooks in my shoulder began to slip. I experienced a new level of pain as I felt jagged talons pierce my side and I folded forward, as I was yanked backwards into the pitch. I felt another agonizing piercing on the other side of my torso before being yanked up away from the earth and everything I had ever known. I was pulled into the pitch past the streetlights, but whatever had me was struggling.\n\nI fell twenty feet onto the ice hard gravel path but wasn’t freed. Violent, metallic screams flooded my ears and bones as my forehead and chin were scraped along the gravel path. I desperately clawed at the earth, trying to find anything to grip but only found fistfuls of gravel and goose shit. The talons in my side ripped out suddenly and I felt a sickening oozing coming from my sides. I had tried to roll over to my knees but the pain on each side was so horrible I felt bile swelling in my throat.\n\nA patch of dirty snow was inches away and I tried to crawl towards it to try to ice my bleeding injuries.\n\nThat was when I felt leathery whips on my face and violent snags in my hair, pulling and snapping. My stomach lurched as again, I was yanked up into the night, higher into my own icy, black death. I tried desperately to grasp on to whatever had me, terrified to fall as we climbed higher.\n\nThe cold stung my raw shoulders and hips and I felt the blood freezing. The deep scrapes on my knees and face burned with the wind, feeling like icy razors scraping my cheekbones. My numb fingers found a thick, velvety limb- coarse hair bristling and slipping under my blood. Six daggers dug into my skull and neck. Even over the roar of the wind and the pounding of wings I could hear a horrible scraping and squeaking of claws on my skull- from the inside.\n\nI struggled to breathe, blood and vomit filled my mouth and tears threatened to suffocate me. Suddenly the little air that I had in my lungs was forced out violently as my midsection was slammed into the highest beam on the moon tower, the crunching of my ribs was unmistakable. My vision and even my own thoughts darkened with what I can only describe as wetness. Later, I would be told that my ribs were so violently broken that they pierced my lung.\n\nFor a moment, the moon illuminated my nightmare. I was nauseatingly high up, one eye was swollen shut but I could see the frozen pond, dull and distant. Closer, I could see a row of houses- their windows glowing but cruelly out of reach. One house still had Christmas lights up, complete with a giant light-up plastic mold Santa Claus tied to their chimney. It felt wrong and cruel- a warm and happy impossibility. I looked down to see a stream of my blood pouring from my body in a steady flow, then broken by an aggressive gust of icy cold wind.I choked on a scream as I was grabbed again, talons stretching out the existing wounds on my shoulders- and birthing brand new ones on my lower back. I couldn’t hear my own screams over the wind and the angry, metallic shrieks like barbed wire on a rusted trampoline.\n\nI remember at this point, I could see the pond shrinking south of me as once again my host struggled with it’s prey. Suddenly, we dropped right above the creek.  My legs slammed into the fence surrounding the construction site. The crane looming over us, the two security floodlights at it’s base finally providing light.\n\nThe construction site was deep in the ground, a parking garage with a basement level built to be tornado proof.\n\nI’ve heard countless times from other people with violent experiences, that they forget chunks of their trauma, or that they blacked out. I try not to seethe with jealousy. If I could forget any of it, I would want to forget what I saw under those garish, white construction lights.\n\nI can remember every tiny, ice cold pebble digging into my skin. The shimmering bokeh on my tear-soaked lashes. The gritty, jagged pain of my pulverized rib bones. I remember the smell: a mix of cold sweat- like when our dad would come home after his jogs- diesel, and blood. There was another smell coming from the base of the crane- sickly sweet like almond extract gone bad.\n\nBehind the crane was a trailer, the paneling was beige and a huge green tin sign had read “Argen Construction”. I thought for a moment that a phone might be inside. I pulled myself up onto my knees and looked around- it was difficult since my left eye was useless and my right one was full of tears and blood. My assailant was nowhere in sight- I thought maybe it had gotten injured or caught on the fence. Stupid. I know now that it simply was rousing it’s companion- because it was dinner time. I was an offering. Like when my cat Nala would bring me a dead robin. Here I was, with my wings ripped off.\n\nI was halfway to the trailer, limping as fast as I could. Every step was excruciating, breathing was like pins and needles. Even with my sobbing hyperventilating- I heard it. I hear it now. I can always hear it. The two-toned whistle. Haunting and dreadful- like even if I hadn’t been at death’s door- that tone would still have shaken me. Like a doomsday alarm. Like useless sirens wailing as meteors crash into the boiling sea.\n\nUnder the whistle, a thick, wet breath. Echoing from beneath the base of the crane. A dark recess in the cold wet ground, with darkness somehow leaking from it. Darkness so black that only a staccatoed steam was visible- something was breathing.\n\nI wish I could tell you that the construction unearthed something ethereal- a beautiful sleeping giant- an angel- a groundbreaking discovery.\n\nBut I don’t even think it was the construction. I just think she’s always been here. Maybe for years she had survived on squirrels, or deer. Maybe she thawed during a warm winter. Maybe she was left behind.\n\nThe first thing I saw was the tattered, jagged tips of wings, bat-like and narrow, dark-veined like bruised plum skin. Her pulse visibly pumping through veins that raised and ripped through her paper-thin skin stretching over her wings so tightly it seemed painful just to exist. Like she wasn’t finished yet, like she had been birthed from the earth prematurely and she was angry. \nHer hair was matted in clumps but where it was free it was long enough to drag along the ground, slimy and cold and full of dirt, leaves and dirty snow. Her scalp was suffering. I could see every follicle piercing her scalp, like diseased plant roots- bulbous and swollen. Open sores at her hairline showed what I can only stomach to explain as insect activity. Layers of sick, sheer skin being actively eaten away by miasis, forehead wrinkles deep and scarred into place. She had no eyebrows or lashes that I could see from my crouched hiding position. Her nose was just a cavity- like a Halloween skull- also swarming with parasites. When she breathed in- a flapping rippled down her face, and wetness dripped over her mouth.\n\nHer mouth.\n\nYears later, an art teacher had told me that while he enjoyed my monstrous horror drawings- that even special effects departments had boundaries and I would be unlikely to get hired if I didn’t tone it down or attempt to make them more realistic. If only he had known I was following his rule: draw what you know.\n\nShe had the familiar sagging of a toothless old woman, with flat, cracked, corpse-like lips. But then she parted them. The rot was dizzying. Her gums had been clawed away, scabs and scars in thick bands of roped grayish mauve flesh. Her top and bottom jaw bones were not simply bared- they were jagged, layered razors. Filed.  But not with anything modern or sharp or clean. Time, madness and desperation had filed and shaped that nightmare maw. Makeshift teeth of rocks had been manically shoved under the skin- adhered with infection and growth. The entire left side of her face was worn through layer by layer, her tongue slipping in and out of what should have been her throat. Sharp, gaunt collarbones literally piercing through that tissue-like skin, dark rancid blood pooling in the deep recess of her collar. She had one misshapen breast, the left side of her chest was deeply scarred and textured- as though it had been burned. Her fingers were bones with jagged talons blackened at the tips. Thick scar tissue marred her shoulders where her wings took her from somewhat humanoid to monstrous. Scars everywhere. Rotting wounds dripped larvae and blood onto the frozen ground. I wish I could forget the momentary warmth I felt as urine poured down my legs- immediately freezing and burning- sticking my jeans to my razed bloody shins.\n\nI tore myself away from staring at her to look for an escape. She had chosen her feeding place well. The deep recess of the site was the length of a football field- since that’s what the field had once been. High walls of frozen earth surrounded us on three sides, climbing up in my condition would have been impossible. There was a ramp at the far entrance but I wouldn’t have made it past her. Only behind me was the fence I had slammed into on the way in, the creek only a few yards from that- and then a row of backyards of houses that included Dominic’s. I had cried then. I cried thinking that only a few minutes away, my best friend was probably getting ready for bed. That he would always remember the night before he woke up to find out his best friend was dead. He had no idea that my blood was spilling all over the places we had run and played. He was warm, with his own mom just feet away. I sobbed then. Thinking of my own mother. It wasn’t the idea of her finding out too, or knowing I would never see her again- it was a guttural, instinctual painful need for her. It was like being too far underwater and being out of breath- kicking as fast as I can but knowing I wouldn’t make it. I needed her but wouldn’t make it to the surface- to her.\n\nMy sobbing had given me away. That horrible metallic sound reverberated around me and I remembered- I was being fed- she was feeding me to something. I had taken a deep breath, bracing myself for the pain; and made for the fence. Before my feet even hit the ground- her claws were in my neck. She flung me further from the trailer and onto the cement that had been poured a few warmer months ago. I gave up, I’ll be honest. I accepted that I was going to die. \nThen I had heard something unexpected- and sickening. Small, furtive movements. Unmistakable vocalizations. Even just from primal grunting and wet groans- I knew. I knew it was young, and I knew it was human.\n\nI felt her toxic breath on me before I realized she had moved. She paused for a second, mapping the wounds she had inflicted- so that she could use them again as grips. That was when she dug in so tight into the openings on my shoulders that I could feel her nails were deep inside my muscles and even the tips of her actual fingers were deep inside the wounds. She flung me further across the cement- closer to the sickening furtive movement. I squeezed my eyes shut. I smelled rancid, organic decay- and the unmistakable odor of feces. I felt small, fluttering fingers on my neck. Small. Little. \n\nChild-like.\n\nI made the inevitable mistake of opening my eyes. I saw dirty blonde hair, tinged with green, draped across tiny feet. Human feet. Baby feet.\n\nHe was maybe three. Dirty and small. His fingernails were long and sharpened to a point. He smiled and thick mucus stretched across several blackened sharp teeth. He was missing some, but what remained were crooked, stained and diseased, stuck in purple rotten gums.\n\nInstead of chubby rosy cheeks, he had hollow sunken grey skin. The bags under his eyes were purple and veined. Instead of bright, youthful eyes, there were haunted orbs, devoid of color. Faded milky irises deformed around dark soulless pupils. He wore what at one time had been pajamas. Under layers of blood and grime, little trains chugged across his small body in a pattern.\n\nThe sobs had returned from their hiding place in my chest. I had felt the need to comfort this small broken doll of a child. That’s when he lunged. His broken glass mouth sinking deep into my forearm. The pain was unbelievable, bright and loud like the headlights of a truck barreling down on you. I pulled away and heard a horrifying squelching sound as my forearm flesh ripped and hung from his tiny plump lips. I gagged as he hungrily shoved my skin into his mouth. He ran to the monster, clinging to her body, his stubby hands sinking into her rotting fruit skin.\n\nI held my hand tightly against my forearm, watching the blood spill in tributaries between my fingers and join in a river down my arm, dripping down to the ground.\nIt began to snow. Tiny delicate laceworks fell into and melted into the steaming pools of blood at my feet. A disgusting gurgling sound brought me back and I watched in horror as the little boy nursed from the nightmare’s surviving breast. Thick blood spilled from the sides of his mouth as she gently swept the hair from his face.\n\nYears later, I would look up the missing childrens database online. I would narrow my search to my state, select the birth year, clumsily guess at the date missing. It would take me six days and two breakdowns- but I would find him- along with an inaccurate age-progression picture. His parents had named him Mason. He was a twin. He had a baby sister and a dog. He went missing from a family camping trip when he and his brother were one.\n\nBut I didn’t know any of that when I watched him wash down my flesh with bloody breast milk from a demon I hadn’t known existed a few hours earlier. Hours earlier I had been at a mall for Christ sake. The mall, with Charlie.\n\nI guess remembering my brother’s body hanging limply across the steering column had jarred me into action. Knowing he wasn’t even a football field away from me got me moving. If I could get over the fence, I could make a beeline for Dominic’s backyard, I would just have to jump over the mostly frozen creek to get there. Then I could run to his parents’ window and have them call the police. I could see the yellow square in the dark that was the sliding glass door to their kitchen from where I was. If I ran through their house as a shortcut, I could run down their driveway and straight down my street to my house. My heart broke a little as I thought of my parents and my sister beginning to worry about us as we were only a block away fighting for our lives.\n\nBut if I got to the far end of the fence, before the incline up- I could get to Charlie- keep him safe, keep him warm and talking until the ambulance arrived. Surely somebody had called, the impact on the the cars was so loud- the other driver surely had a car phone or maybe a cell phone. Maybe even Yuki’s Akita puppy Mochi had heard and was barking up a storm. Maybe the police were already there.\n\nFor a moment, I thought of grabbing the boy, even if he bit me, I would carry him on my back and get him away from her, get him home to his family.  But even as I stood there, I could barely hold myself up, the world had started to spin around me, blood thickly but steadily pooling in my shoes, my bra and at the top of my jeans.\n\nA few feet from my right lay a rubble pile, not large but mainly chunks of rebar and concrete. I had barely made a few inches of progress towards it when her metallic screeching again assaulted my senses. My hands covering my ears, I shuffled towards the pile and grabbed a chunk of the rubble- a crude, misshapen and awkward hammer to wield against an impossible enemy. A rusted, twisted metal handle with a heavy and uneven weight of concrete, hard to hold and even harder to swing- but it was all I had- and I knew it only had to get to the weakest part of her. I only had to incapacitate her long enough to get within earshot of Dominic’s house- it couldn’t be much past 10 pm, someone would have to hear me.\n\nI gripped my shoddy weapon tightly at my chest with both hands and felt her swoop down violently as I dove for a cement tunnel, her empty-handed dive throwing her balance off. I scrambled awkwardly towards the far end of the tunnel as I heard her raspy wings pulling her upwards before her second strike. Instead of waiting for her to cut me off at the tunnel, I ran as fast as I could, darting from the opening and towards the sickly-sweet smelling of her nest. The only thing between the fence and me was a blonde baby boy. Blood swirled in my mouth and a gritty, sharp feeling forced me to spit. I don’t know why the image of my tooth in my hand covered in blood triggered a response in me then but it did.\n\nI knew I was dying. Not just that I was going to die- that this monster my parents had never imagined in their worst nightmares would take their daughter away forever and they would never even have her body to bury- but that I currently and actively was dying.\n\nThe damage to my ribs, lungs, spleen and arm would kill me if the blood loss or hypothermia didn’t do it first. I knew I was dying and it turned me into a monster too.\n\nI ran, not straight for the fence, but for her nest, I could hear her above me, barreling down. I ran right towards that little boy and swung a twenty pound chunk of concrete down on his tiny hand, smashing it into the ground. The sound he made wakes me up at night to this day. His screams were animal-like and I dropped my weapon to cover my ears. The rusted metal screaming from the sky crashed down like a bomb and I ran. I didn’t look back. I ran to the fence and with all the strength I had left, I pulled myself up, shoving my foot into a diamond-shaped hole made by the chain-link. I had hopped a thousand fences this way in my life and to this day I am grateful I had the experience.\n\nMy bleeding hands found the freezing, horizontal pipe of the top of the fence and groaned in pain as I hefted myself over. All the fence hopping experience in the world wouldn’t have made climbing with shattered ribs and bleeding flanks any less impossible and I could only crash to the ground. Both ankles jarred into the frozen ground and my scream stuck in my throat, caught on blood and bile, escaping only as a choking sob.\n\nHer violent, crazed screams were still on the ground as she tended to her baby. I didn’t let guilt slow me down, I ran as fast as I could for maybe six feet before my ankles gave out. Dominic’s house was all I could see, a tunnel of black closing in on my vision. I never looked back. I gripped my fingers into the frosty ground, pulling myself up. I hobbled, sprinting across the dark field. The night sky above me swirling with snow flurries. My busted, bloody fingers fumbling at my jacket zipper. I could see the flickering blue glow of late-night tv coming from Mr and Mrs Rossi’s bedroom. The tunnel grew smaller and I could see less and less. \n\nBawling, I forced my arms out of my jacket as I reached the bank of the creek. Dominic and I had spent summers of our childhood testing the width of the creek along its entirety and I knew that the bend behind his house was not jumpable. My toes slipped over the crest of land and razor sharp talons slashed at my hands. I screamed and screamed and swung my jacket into the writhing storm of limbs and wings above me, feeling solid impact on one of the swings. I let go of my jacket and flung myself across the frozen creek, landing with a foot left, my feet crushing through the glass-thin ice and my ankles crumpling beneath me. I could only see a pinhole I’m front of me- a flickering blue of tv light. I could hear her above me, driving down finally for the kill. Her metallic screams, and the deafening boom of Mr Rossi’s handgun, the one I never even knew he had.\n\nHe was standing on the back porch, one hand over his head, gun pointed to the sky. Mrs Rossi stood next to him, Dominic’s baseball bat in her hands. The last thing I saw was the golden, warm glow of the Rossi kitchen, and the pinhole closing as the world darkened around me.\n\nI’ve read the statements Mr and Mrs Rossi gave to the police. That they heard what they thought were animal noises behind the house, but when they opened the back door, they heard human screaming as well. They saw a large, dark shape in the night but only for a second before they saw my body slumped over, my fingers barely making it to their property. They had called 911 and then my parents. The ambulance that brought my brother and the other driver to the hospital had only arrived thirty minutes before mine did. My dad had run to the Rossi house while my poor confused and frantic mother rode to the hospital with Cammie and our neighbor.\n\nWhen my dad and I recently recalled the events of that night, I cried hearing the usually funny and goofy man choke up remembering seeing me slumped over Mrs Rossi like a rag doll, her white robe covered in my blood. He said that my face was so bruised and swollen that he thought an animal had mauled my face. He wasn’t exactly wrong. Mr Rossi had stood guard with the bat until the police and EMTs arrived.\n\nAnimal control didn’t press me too hard. In fact, the vaguer and foggier my memory was, the happier they seemed. I knew that if I told the truth, I would be locked up, medicated, or assumed to be a victim of something else. A monster woman from the sky. Before I even tried to say it out loud, I knew better and feigned memory loss. To this day the official story is two cars on Pondside were struck by a wild animal, and the passenger of one of the cars was attacked and dragged by the animal until a neighbor heard the commotion and fired a gun, scaring the animal off. While I was in the hospital, a handful of flowers, candles and teddy bears were left at the stop sign.\n\nCharlie doesn’t remember anything. He says the last thing he can recall is running to the car in the parking lot and turning the heat on, before pulling the car around for me. I’m actually happy this is the last thing he remembers. I wonder if he’s telling the truth.\n\nCammie would come in my room at night for years. She would sit on the floor next to my bed, with her fuzzy Disney blanket draped over her shoulders. She knew the whole story from beginning to end- even about Mason- a detail I had kept from my parents. Cam and I would stay up together until the sun came up, our eyes locked on the window in my room, the one facing south. Some nights she would get in bed with me; both of us sitting with our backs against the wall, our shoulders resting on one another’s, both of us looking at the window, scanning every inch of the gray blue pitch fading to flint every morning- searching for a growing speck of black.\n\nMy parents- proud pacifists, had purchased a gun each, and a few years later they had Cammie and I in judo classes. But the best thing they did was believe me. Even that first night, after the first surgery, they had listened intently, never interrupting or telling me I was imagining things or lying. However, it was made it very clear that while our home was a safe space- we weren’t to talk about it outside it’s walls.\n\nI know she’s still out there, I know Mason is too. Even after I moved away, my mom would send newspaper articles, first clippings in the mail, then eventually links in text messages as time went on. Police blotters about animal activity, missing dogs, unexplained accidents- and missing blonde boys.  She took one every few years, from different areas, and I thought initially maybe she had killed or eaten Mason once he was too old. Until I saw them both one night. I had heard that whistle and didn’t even need to look up, but I did. But that’s a story for another time.",

        "text": "Have you ever heard someone say your name just as you’re falling asleep? Usually when that happens to me, it’s my dad’s voice—a familiar sound my brain has decided to reproduce as I transition to dreamland. Two weeks ago, though, as I lay in the darkness waiting to drift off, I heard my name as a whisper—\n\n*shauna*\n\nSince I thought it was just a sleepy hallucination, I let myself resume the drifting-off process.\n\n*shauna*\n\nThe second time I heard my name, I still wrote it off.\n\n*shauna*\n\nThe third time, I sat up as quickly as if I’d just felt the first tremor of an earthquake. I live alone. What *was* that?\n\n*shauna* (a little louder this time) . . . *SHAUNA* (louder still, like a stage whisper)\n\n*SHAUNA SHAUNA SHAUNA*\n\nBy now I was frantic, shaking, trying to untwist from my sheets as I scrambled out of the bed, so vigorously pulling the chain to turn on my bedside lamp that it almost fell off the table. The whispers penetrated straight to my eardrums, as commanding as screams. I don’t know why my attention focused on the jewelry box sitting on the dresser, but nevertheless I moved to open it.\n\n*SHAUNA SHAU—*\n\nThe whispering stopped the moment I opened the box. Clammy and breathless, I marched that box outside in the freezing winter air and tossed it in the trash (I’d already lost the ring a month ago anyway). I didn’t know *what* I was dealing with, but I sure as heck wasn’t keeping that box. When nothing more happened for the next couple of days, I held three competing hypotheses in my mind: one, that I had dreamed it; two, that I was losing it; or three, that there was *something* in the ring box, but that it was well on its way to the landfill, never to be heard (by me at least) again. Unfortunately, I was forced to confront a fourth hypothesis three days later, as I lay in my bed watching the shadows cast on the wall by the bare branches outside my window.\n\n*shauna*\n\nPrimed to act following the original incident, I began immediately to search for the source of the whisper, hoping that whatever had caused me to home in on the ring box would also guide me this time.\n\n*shauna . . . shauna SHAUNA SHAUNA*\n\nThe whispers stopped when I opened my wicker laundry basket.\n\nAt this point I wouldn’t entirely blame you for thinking, *So what? A whisper isn’t intrinsically menacing, and all you have to do is open a box to make it go away.* But I dare you, *dare* you, to take a look around your room right now. Find a box, a canister, any container, and see if you can imagine hearing your own name. A soft whisper at first, then louder and increasingly insistent until you find the source.\n\nOf course, I considered the possibility that my second hypothesis was the correct one: I could simply be losing my mind. I thought this particularly likely when the whispers started happening in the daytime, too. But when I answered a call from my mom during an episode— \n\n*SHAUNA SHAUNA SHAUNA SHAUNA*\n\n—she heard it too.\n\n“Who’s there with you?” she asked, and that was all I needed to know. If I thought finding out I was crazy was bad, turns out finding out I’m not alone in my apartment is worse.\n\nThe thing, whatever it was, continued to taunt me, enacting a sick game of hide-and-seek that I had to play over and over and over. I found it in the oven, under the cap of a herbicide can, even, on one horrifying occasion, in the protector for the pillow under my head. I thought leaving the house would give me a break, but it hissed my name from my purse as I walked across the grocery store parking lot in the gathering dusk.\n\nThe last time I left my house was three days ago. It was closing time at my local mom-and-pop bookstore, and I was the only patron. The owner, a mustachioed Old Boston type was ringing up a wall calendar while I fumbled for my credit card.\n\n*shauna*\n\nMy head snapped up to see the owner now with his eyes rolled back. The whisper had come from his closed mouth.\n\n*SHAUNA SHAUNA*\n\nBlood rushed in my ears, but not loud enough to drown it out. I reached forward as if in a trance myself, and placed my finger on his chin. His jaw lowered, gaping wide like a nutcracker. I didn’t stay to find out if he was OK; I ran to my car and blew through every stop sign on my way home. I decided then that I would live off the non-perishables in my pantry, and have groceries delivered when those ran out. There was no way in hell I’d risk interacting with another human again unless I could be sure their face wouldn’t cleave. I didn’t want to think about what would happen if the thing decided to hide inside *me*—if *my* eyes rolled back, would I be able to open my own jaw? Maybe it already crawled in and out of my mouth from time to time.\n\nRight now I’m parked a few yards away from a pond garnished with patches of ice. I’m here because earlier on this cold, January night, I made a mistake. When I sat in my living room trying to distract myself with a crossword, I heard—\n\n*shauna*\n\n—coming from the dingy metal lockbox on my bookshelf. The box has sentimental value (I kept babysitting money in it as a teenager), but I no longer have the key. The whispers got louder and more demanding as I tried and failed to open the box. I’m sure there are tools that would have gotten it open easily, but I panicked. \n\n*SHAUNA*\n\nI grabbed the lockbox, ran to my car, and started to drive. I was frantic, *frantic* to make the whispering stop, my body tense as I braced for the next time I would hear my name. I drove to where I’m parked now, got out of the car, and heaved the box into the pond’s dark water. I had two hypotheses, if you can even use that word to describe my wild, grasping thoughts: one, that the thing would simply rematerialize in some other container, maybe even my glove compartment on the drive home; or two, that it would be gone forever. I didn’t consider the third possibility: that it would still expect me to open that drowned lockbox; that it wouldn’t be satisfied until I did; that no matter how far away I got, it would whisper to me from beneath the pond’s surface, the sound as clear to my ears as if it were right beside me.\n\n*shauna*",

        "text": "  \n\nI had not considered the idea of ghosts. All I knew then was that the property was cheap. I remember standing on that dilapidated front step for the first time. I remember standing there, pondering on the events that had led me to such low point. The graduation, economic prosperity, the new corner office, I wanted to pause my life story right there. Everything was perfect. A little too perfect. I was on top of the world, and the only one who could bring me down was me. One drunken binge later, and I landed myself in litigation land. Thousands in court fees with a year of appointed AA later, and there I was. Sober but near broke, with nothing but a dilapidated house to my name. Without the meager employment opportunities provided by this small town, I wouldn’t even have had that. At least the house came fully furnished.\n\nI grabbed the handle of my old suitcase and crossed the threshold. The porch creaked as my weight left its wooden planks and moved to the interior of the house. Before today, I’d barely had time to poke my head in before the previous owner swept me away to the local café to talk numbers. He had practically begged me to take the house off his hands. In the moment I felt like I was lowballing him. Seeing the manor interior in all its splendor told me that I may have actually done him a favor. The house looked as though it had smoked three packs a day for twenty-five years. The yellow wallpaper was peeling and stained. Light filtering in through the dirty windows seemed to highlight the unusual amount of dust floating above the ancient floorboards. I moved to a small table in the living room and stuck my charger into the nearby outlet. My phone vibrated as I plugged it in, and I left it there while I explored the rest of the house. From what the last owner had told me, the house was divided into three floors. The main floor held the living room and the kitchen while the upstairs was exclusively bedrooms. The cellar had apparently housed hundreds of bottles of wine back in its prime but now was mostly empty. \n\nApart from a few cobwebs, the kitchen held no surprises. Faux granite counter tops with faded brown cabinetry held more than enough storage for my lonesome self, and an old rotary phone hung on the wall. A relic of its time, it’s only use would be as a decoration. The dining room was another story. Upon entering I was immediately greeted by, well, me. A full, floor-to-ceiling mirror spanned the entire wall opposite the entry way where I stood. I startled for a split second before recognizing my face, and my thoughts turned from danger to wonderment.\n\n*“Who would ever put something like this in here?”* I shrugged it off as being a trend of decades past and turned my attention briefly to the object between us. The dining room table was near ebony in color, with six chairs distributed evenly around it. At some point, a family must have lived here, but decided they were better of finding a new table in a new land. Their loss would not be my gain, as I did not want to exacerbate my loneliness by eating at a massive table alone. I made my way back into the main room and glanced at my phone on my way to the basement stairs. No messages, typical. \n\nI remember thinking during that first descent that the cellar was exactly like any other cellar I had seen. In my previous life I had rubbed shoulders with many affluent people. If there’s one thing affluent people love, it’s showing off their wine collection.  The empty racks still stood as if brand new, ready to resume their duties at a moment’s notice. What made this wine cellar unique however was the furnace located through a door at the opposite end of the room. Where the wine cellar had been a somewhat pleasant room to be in, the room housing the furnace was the opposite. Dark and full of cobwebs. The old grizzly thing must have been installed when the house was first built, because it looked like it hadn’t been used in decades. The access panel was rusted and would not budge no matter how hard I pulled. I didn’t want to imagine the spider’s nests housed within, so I left without trying too much harder. Another trip up to the ground floor, another quick look at my phone, and I was off to pick my room upstairs. \n\nAs I reached the top floor it dawned on me that apart from the throw rug in the living room there were no carpets in the house. I was a big believer in hard wood flooring but the water staining in the first room was a bit of an eyesore. If I ever had guests I would have to find something to cover it up. I laughed morbidly at the thought. There would have to be someone who wanted to see me first. Upon inspection of the second habitation it became clear that four of the five bedrooms shared the same design. About 11 by 12 foot rectangles each with a set of drawers and a writing desk built in to the wall. The fifth space appeared to be the master bedroom. It was much larger and, on top of the expected complement of desk and drawer, housed a large walk in closet. This room had water staining like the first, but in a much more aggressive pattern. Most of the space along the back wall was stained, as well as a pattern cutting out at 90 degrees from the wall to around the middle of the room. It was as if it was marking out the spot to put a master bedframe. The last owner had mentioned that the beds were the only things not included as he had decided to donate the mattresses. Luckily My pillow-top was one of the few things I’d been able keep from my old life. I could slum it without a frame until I got somewhat back on my feet. \n\nThe one advantage to having barely any possessions left was the ease of moving. Unloading the trailer and putting everything in its place took barely an hour. After placing the last pan in its cabinet, I took a long sigh of acceptance. This was the bed I had made, and I was prepared to lie in it. Maybe this could be some form of atonement, and maybe I could make the best of the situation. I went to the living room and sat down on a chair next to the small table. Pizza sounded good, and the little shop I had passed on the way in advertised free delivery. I reached for my phone to search the number, but my hand met only desk. My stomach dropped as I realized that my phone was not on the table at all. I was sure I had left it there to charge, but things had been a little hectic in the moving process. I had probably picked it up and left it with one of the boxes. I instinctively thought to call the device in order to hear the ringtone but quickly shot that down. \n\n*“Yeah, try the rotary, idiot.”* shaking my head, I got up to search. The smaller bedrooms were all empty, and the master, though now somewhat furnished, remained phone-less. From downstairs I suddenly heard the sound of plastic and glass vibrating against wood. I was getting a call. I ran down, hunting for the source of the noise. Through the kitchen I finally spotted my phone placed neatly in the center of the dining room table. I must have left it in there when I was unloading the kitchen boxes. I looked down at the smart device to see a missed call from an unknown number. Probably spam. I put my phone in my pocket and looked up, once again contemplating the loneliness of my new life here. As I looked into the mirror however, I realized that I wasn’t alone at all. Around me, seated at the table, were six other people. Staring into the mirror. Staring at me. I screamed and twisted around to remove the intruders from my newly acquired home, but they had vanished. The seats were as empty as they had been when I’d arrived. The mirror displayed the same, with the exception of my now ghost white complexion. I breathed a long sigh of anxiety and frustration. \n\n“*I must be tired.”* I wasn’t wrong. At that point it had been nearly 24 hours since I had last slept. The long drive here had not afforded any time to rest. Hallucinations were common on that kind of awake time. Or at least, so I had heard. I resolved to go straight to bed and get some food in the morning. At this point I began to be aware of how exhausted I really was. While there was nothing I wanted to do less than stay a night by myself, I had no other choice. I carried myself up to my mattress and fell into the dark of sleep.",

        "text": " **This was written shortly after moving into a trailer home in Minnesota. I was writing it both as a means of making an interesting story and also just as a way for me to explore what my extreme fear response is after I've calmed down. I did a mild proofread, (very basic fixed done while scanning over it) but I don't care enough about it to properly finish it. I thought some of you would find it interesting.**\n\n*This room isn't good for my sleep. Maybe I'm just not used to the sounds of a trailer house nearing the start of a Minnesota winter halfway in the wilderness.* \n\n*The vent near my door is loose and full of small junk that accumulated from the previous tenants. All night it makes clicking sounds with a changing pattern I can never pin down. No matter how long much time I spend thinking about it. That vent has a special way of throwing the sound across the room. Sometimes it sounds as if there was a hard tap on the window right next to the head of my bed, but it doesn't quite sound like glass. Not that it stops me from freezing to listen intently for something beyond my curtained window.*\n\n*There are always sounds outside my room. I'm sure part of it is snow building upon the roof and then falling off, sometimes small, sometimes large, and often I can hear it roll on the ground. The corner of my room is also the corner of the house so the sound wrap around me. There's also something about the paneling of this house. If something creaks at the other end I hear it through my walls, not because they are thin, but because there is some method in which the vibration moves through the walls. Is my brother rolling in his bed at one AM or was it snow drifting off the roof near his room? You can hardly tell the difference, and they both sound like it's happening just to the right of me, but at a distance, I just can't seem to measure.*\n\n*There are animals here, I've seen a bunch of deer no more than eight meters from our porch. I even caught a glimpse of a bear cub not far down the road. We're those sounds outside an animal's step crunching the snow, was it my brother getting up to get water, could snow roll of the roof in such a pattern that it sounded like footsteps.* \n\n*And I know my neighbors come out late at night at least briefly, I have of them. About where I lay in my bed, there is a house not far behind me separated only by a single line of small trees as a fence, one to the left of me, further down but equally visible, and then one in front of me, past my sister's room and across a narrow driveway. Speaking of the driveway there's one right behind me, the neighbors to the left of me sometimes drive a vehicle home at 11 pm across it, one one of my neighbors likes to take their dog to do their business there. Even just an hour ago while I was writing I heard two people chatting no doubt on their way inside, and it's 1:30 am, and I know it was people because one clearly laughed.* \n\n*Sometimes I hear a sound I cant imagine a likely cause for. Like when I hear wood creek on the wall left to me, why would an external wall creek out of nowhere when there's nothing on the other side? It doesn't take much to get me thinking and it only takes some bad luck for it to spook me. I come across one thing mentioning a serial killer, an unfortunate event, or even a certain.kind of action scene in a movie and then for the next minute or so I'll be reminded of the many unnerving stories and topics I've researched, its probably my adhd that does that.* \n\n*And then the wall creaks, and some snow falls, or my brother rolled over. It throws you off and then the clicking of the vent which was quiet for about five minutes suddenly kicks back into action with the sound of a loud metallic tap on your window. Now you're reminding yourself what every on of those sounds could be, often the multiple of things it could be. And you listen to the sounds trying to reassure yourself that these things are actually understandable, and its just long enough to hear something different. Something you weren't prepared to explain.* \n\n*Now what you were doing before doesn't matter because these sounds will haunt you until you've figured it out. So you stop your breathing for a moment just to be sure and maybe it goes silent, or sometimes worse a number of things happen at the same time so it seems like something is happening in every conceivable direction. Then that's when you realize that weird sound from earlier that started the paranoid episode was more than likely your sister snoring irregularly, but just as you start to feel like the episode might be able to start winding down, the air ventilation system kicks on and its whirring mechanical wind muddies everything to the near indecipherable.* \n\n*Now for the next two to five minutes every single sound is causing alarm, and you are fighting the impossible battle of a single human minds coping and compartmentalizing the patterns of several unrelated systems, most of them rivaling the complexity of ecological systems still in research today on the fly, and you do it just praying that your monkey brain can construct a powerful enough illusion that you understand these things just long enough so you can calm down and get some sleep. You are at the mercy of unknowable forces outside of your control, put on edge by an irrational fear of your safety, forced to ride this train until those forces finally give you a predictable enough pattern that your heart stops pounding and you're brave enough to drown out the sound with some tv. Except every few days these forces show no mercy and send you a pattern louder and sometimes stranger than normal so that the amygdala is convinced there are things just outside your room moving in a way that doesn't make sense for earthly creatures to move, and it hits a climax! You jump out of your bed with 91 already typed on your phone and the flashlight on because you just can't be caught unprepared. For the briefest moment your brain conjures the most horrifying cause to this stuff outside the house. You either double down on it being impossible and pull the curtain from your window, or you go across the house to speak to your brother just so that you have security in numbers and he can tell you its nothing. Opening that window never helps, at night I cant make out anything unless it was only a fee inches away, between the double-paned glass and the trees blocking viable angles for moonlight, you just stare into black. Oh hey, we had some issues with out toilet plumbing, maybe the pipes were part of it. Or the cats, yeah, the cats.*\n\n*At least two times every night I go through a panic mode where I have to rationalize all the sounds to calm my beating heart. I never feel okay until I can see sunlight through the crack between the window and its curtain. I haven't been here long enough for it to happen, but usually once every fifty days or so I'll get an intense feeling that I'm in danger. I'm always perfectly safe and it usually happens at night but its been light out a few times. I've never felt as much fear as I did when a garbage truck broke the silence of early morning while I was like that. If I ever experience that here I'll make someone stay awake with me until its over, I couldn't face that alone. The scary part of this is if I get used to it, if I come to accept these sounds then I would notice if something really was happening outside my window. If the horrors I pictured at the worst moment we're completely real would I even notice? I wouldn't, not unless the window broke.*  \n\n\n  \n**For those curious: I started sleeping normally about a week and a half after writing this story, and now although the sounds. Nowadays I'm so good at blocking the sounds out that I don't notice I'm doing it. And I did figure out what a lot of the rumbling footsteps are from though it does ruin some of this stories atmosphere to know:** &gt;!?the trees outside my window have a short fence that the branches hit agianst when its windy. I wasnt aware of this at the time and the bulk of footsteps and unpredictability of the sounds were due to this fence.!&lt;",

        "text": "Yep. It's true. No one believes me, of course. Well, except my parents. Though my parents had already been established by most people, including my teacher, as maniacs. I couldn't really blame them, though. My parents are called \"occultists\". At least, I think so. My dad, my mom, and all their crazy robed friends hang out in the basement every sunday, and scream a bunch of random shit in a language that I don't understand. To be honest, I couldn't give two shits about whatever weird stuff they do, but what they did yesterday CROSSED THE LINE.\n\nOne fateful Sunday, my parents went down into the basement with a whole ARMY of robed people. I had never seen that many people here at once. I could still care less, so I put on my headphones and had some fun fooling around with my friends on a discord call. Then the first round of screaming started. I didn't want my friends to realize that I had a bunch of weird dorks for parents, so I subsequently left and instead decided to work on a very important essay that I had been delaying for as long as possible. I only had a few hours left until it was due and I had barely even started writing. So I got to work, and was actually being pretty productive. A couple hours in, some random robed guy walked out of the basement with a trash bag. Whatever was in it smelled like a thousand dead rats stacked on top of each other, and it made me want to vomit. He went outside, disposed of whatever it was, and then went back down.\n\nI continued working until I was just a paragraph or two away from that sweet, sweet submission button. Suddenly, the chanting from downstairs was interrupted by a loud clanging and what sounded like someone doing a very convincing imitation of a monstrous roar. The loud chanting went from loud and methodical to loud and utterly chaotic, but every 10 seconds or so, I could hear the volume diminish slightly, as if one by one, the voices were being snuffed out. Once the chanting faded, I heard approaching footsteps accompanied by a resounding monstrous growl, until this... *thing* burst through the door, roaring savagely.\n\n It looked like a lion, except it was jet black and was speckled with glowing dots, almost like stars hanging against the backdrop of space. It had a mane made not of hair, but a writhing mass of tentacles. It simply stared at me, and I stared back, frozen in fear. Then, one of the tentacles shot out, prying the laptop from my grip, and depositing the poor helpless computer into its salivating mouth. And then it left. That MOTHERFUCKER just dissipated into thin air. I know that it could have obviously killed me on the spot. But instead it chose to do the pettiest FUCKING thing imaginable.\n\nNow, at the time, I wasn't too worried. But then when my dad crawled up the stairs, looking happier than I'd ever seen before, covered in blood, and holding what I'm pretty sure was my mother's decapitated head, I asked him what had just happened. And he told me this:\n\n\"That, my son, was Ghril'itrod, the avatar of dementia, and the first horror I've ever managed to successfully summon. Everything that he totally consumes is completely erased from existence.\"\n\nFuck. He was right. To be truthful, I'm not even sure I was working on that essay with a laptop, but I'm just assuming because a laptop is very... \"Me\". To make a long story short, a bunch of people in fancy suits and cool looking sun glasses took my father and his gang of followers somewhere where I doubt I'll ever see him again(good riddance) and then sent me to live with my grandmother, who is significantly more agreeable, and can also make a MEAN batch of cookies. Luckily, I managed to just barely pass English, and my GPA will probably be able to recover from it with time. Still, Ghril'itrod, if you're out there somewhere, FUCK YOU!",

(sk\\*\\* wa\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*, i dont feel comfortable even typing that name) my neighbors, family, and i have seen things in and around our neighborhood, that can only be described as such. ive seen deer on their hind legs, walking in our backyard for an OBSCENE ammount of time, another time my dog wouldnt go near any of us for around 3 days and was growling and had an extremely unsettling look in his eyes, and was foaming at the mouth. (we got him checked for rabies and it wasnt that) my neighbor, who has lived here since he was born, claims to have seen mountain lions, bears, and deformed creatures his entire life. (neither of those are common here) and i think the scariest, my mom seeing a wild boar in our front yard, while she was out there grabbing groceries. and it wasnt normal. it wasnt walking right. not in a hurt type of way but in a way that seemed it had never walked before in its life.\n\nthe next thing is the sleep paralysis. all four people in my family experience it on at least a once every month basis. and we all see the same thing. a shadow, with orange waxy and melting eyes, somewhere in our room. even people who have come to spend the night, who have never experienced it before our house, have had it and experienced the same thing.\n\nmisc things- doors being locked from the inside randomly (we have turn locks, not push locks), hearing what sounds like women/kids/babies crying and screaming at night, constant shadows, and the feeling of being watched. always. i dont think ive ever spent a second inside this house without feeling like something is watching me.\n\nagain, i am open to all theroies and suggestions. i just need to get this off of my chest because nobody except for the people who have spent time in this neighborhood believe me.",

They all hate me for no reason, it's not fair!  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI honestly thought I was gonna go crazy always by myself but then I heard a story about how POWs in Vietnam dealt with it. They were trapped like me and without any stimulation many of them lost it, but a few of them discovered a trick that protected them. In their minds they would recreate something they read or heard in extreme detail. A novel word by word or a song note by note. It kept them focused and motivated and sane. Mind you it can't be just a vague remembering. Every detail has to be considered no matter how small until it's correct, until you're absolutely certain it's correct.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been doing it for awhile now and I can say it definitely works. Pokemon Red for the Nintendo Game Boy, that's what I recreate, down to the smallest detail. Now Solitary is nothing to me because I just play Pokemon over and over again in my head. It's wonderful.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI play it exactly the way I played it as a kid. I always pick Charmander of course, he's my favorite. and I don't bother catching other pokemon because Charmander's the best! But the first two gyms are tough for fire-types. The first gym is rock based which fire is ineffective against. And the next gym is water based which is Charmander's greatest weakness. The Cerulian City gym leader is Misty, she has no honor and happily exploits my Charmander's weakpoint making him faint over and over again. It's not fair, I have to grind a lot just to survive one Water Gun attack.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMisty is mean. I'll never forgive her.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter her though the game is easy since Charmander has evolved into the very powerful Charizard.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI get impatient now, just like when I was a kid,  and start rushing through the game, trying to get to Fuschia city as fast as possible. Fuschia City is where you get the item HM04 which teaches Strength. Strength is a technique that let's my Charizard move heavy objects. Once you've learned it you can go back to Vermillion City where there's a secret only I know about! If you go to the Vermillion City docks there's a parked truck that you can now move! Underneath it is a secret HM. I use it on my Charizard and learn a new ability.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was younger I didn't know how to use the new move because its name was a word I'd never heard before. I would walk around randomly using it everywhere. For awhile I do this in my recreation as well even though I'm very familiar with the word now, and I know exactly how to use the move too, you just have to be standing next to a building.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Charizard used Arson\".  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe green and grey screen lights up in glorious red and the gameboy even gets hot. The fire will burn forever if you watch it, which I do for hours. When you leave the screen and come back the building is now ashes. And the best part? All the people inside are now ghost-type pokemon, which you can capture.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's time, it's finally time! Back to Cerulean City as fast as I can, I can't wait anymore!  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI burn down the Gym and I capture everyone inside, including Misty. They're now mine to punish as I see fit, as it should be.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI make them fight to exhaustion over and over again. I freeze them and poison them and burn them and then revive them again and again until every Pokemon Center in the world is burnt to the ground and then I go home and store them in my PC, the last PC in the game. Each in their own solitary box, and then I burn my house down so they can never leave. I wonder if they know the way to stay sane? I hope not.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter this I delete my save and I do it again and again and again and again. Just like I did it when I was a kid. Exactly like I did it when I was a kid.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPokemon Red was very important to me. I grew up playing it, I learned to read playing it. It was my only game and in some ways it was my only friend. It's like that in here too. Everyone in here is a bully. Even the warden is a bully. When I was arrested I had a big bag of marbles, just a harmless bag of marbles. I've begged the warden and anyone who'll listen, please give them back, but they refuse. Even though it means a lot to me they always refuse.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't even want the whole bag really, only twelve of the marbles really matter to me. The rest are empty.",

        "text": "I always wanted to be a painter. When my wife and I bought our house, I had an idea that I’d set up a studio in the attic and paint. It would be a nice little getaway from the rest of my life, just a chance to settle down away from all of the outside distractions and paint whatever came to mind.\n\nIt never came together. That wasn’t anyone’s fault, not even mine. Life just happened. Work took up a chunk of my day, the commute took another piece, and then we had kids and the rest of my free time just vanished. I still told myself that I was going to set up that studio someday. The attic was perfect for it, after all, or would be once I cleared some of the boxes out of the way. I knew I’d get to it just as soon as I had a little break.\n\nWell, you know how that goes. Soon enough our oldest daughter was ten, and I hadn’t touched a paintbrush in a dozen years or more. I didn’t mind it, exactly, but I still thought about it from time to time and sort of wished that I’d find or make the time for my old hobby.\n\nThen one day I was up in the attic putting the Christmas decorations away, and I saw that someone had cleared a big space up against the back wall, right where the light from the big round window shone. All of the boxes that had been in the area had been stacked up to the sides, their position taken by something large draped in a sheet.\n\nCurious, I went over and pulled the sheet aside. Beneath it was a large wooden easel with a canvas propped up on it, blank and begging to be painted.\n\nI grinned to myself. Obviously this was a surprise my wife Zoya was setting up for me. She’d realized that I was never actually going to get around to putting my studio in place, and so she’d taken it upon herself to do it for me. It was an extremely sweet gesture, and honestly probably the only way I was actually going to get back into painting before the kids went off to college, if then. If she’d taken the time to set up the space for me, it would be rude not to use it, after all.\n\nI didn’t say anything to her when I went back downstairs. I hadn’t seen any paints around, so I figured she had a presentation planned whenever she was going to give it to me. I certainly wasn’t going to ruin her present by telling her that I’d seen it early. It wasn’t my birthday for a while, but maybe she was thinking about doing it as a Valentine’s Day present?\n\nA couple of weeks went by, and Zoya hadn’t said anything about the easel in the attic. I was up there for something else—a legitimate reason, not just to snoop to see if she’d done anything—and to my surprise, I noticed that the sheet over the easel had some paint spatters on it. I was pretty sure it had been clean and new before.\n\nThe paint was dry to the touch, which probably meant that I had just been wrong about the newness of the covering. As long as I was over there anyway, though, I lifted the sheet to peek at the easel again. I love looking at blank canvases. They’re so full of potential. It was one of my favorite things about painting: the knowledge that there was always another fresh start just waiting for me.\n\nThe canvas was no longer blank. It was painted in a flurry of blues and blacks, an impressionistic style that I’d always admired but never mastered. The background was an array of medical devices and personnel, clustered and overlapping in a manner that conveyed urgency and haste. The central piece, stretching diagonally across the canvas, was a cutaway of an arm, showing a snapped ulna.\n\nOrdinarily, I might not have been sure which bone was which. But just two days ago, my younger daughter Kara had fallen while climbing and broken the thinner of the two bones in her forearm, the ulna. The doctors had shown us the X-rays and told us that although the break looked severe, the cast would only have to stay on for a little over a month.\n\nI didn’t have copies of the X-rays, but from my recollection her break looked almost exactly like the one shown on the canvas before me.\n\nI lowered the sheet again, puzzled. Was Zoya coming up here to paint? I wouldn’t have minded if she was, though I had no idea it was something she was into. Why keep it a secret from me, though? Was she worried I’d be angry if she was better than me?\n\nThat night before dinner, I tried to ask Zoya about it.\n\n“Hey hon, you know that little art studio in the attic?”\n\n“Oh, are you finally going to set that up?” she asked me brightly. “That’s fantastic! Let me know if we need to get rid of anything up there to clear out space. We could probably get rid of half of the junk up there and never miss it.”\n\nHer response baffled me. It was possible that she was pretending she didn’t know about it to still keep it a surprise for me, but if so, why offer to help me set it up? I couldn’t figure out how to ask if she really didn’t know or if she was just acting like she didn’t, and the conversation naturally moved on to other topics.\n\nThe next day, though, it was still bothering me. I decided to go back to the attic, bring down the painting and show it to Zoya. She could hardly deny having set up the studio in the attic once I showed her that I’d seen her work.\n\nOnly when I looked under the sheet this time, the arm painting wasn’t there. There was a different canvas, showered in bloody shades of red. A thick vertical column spiked upward at one side, and at its base was the shape of a man. The red paint was thickest and darkest at his head, spreading outward in a lake to cover the rest of the canvas.\n\nI found it deeply unsettling, not least because the figure bore at least a passing resemblance to me. I touched the paint, but it was dry. Zoya must have painted it last night after I went to sleep. The work was excellent, but I still had no idea why she was being so secretive.\n\nI took the new painting off of the easel and replaced the sheet. As I did so, I spied the painting of the broken arm leaning up against the wall; I’d missed it behind the easel before. I picked it up as well and carried them both to the attic ladder.\n\nThe paintings blocked my vision as I took my first careful step onto the pull-down stairs. It was slightly precarious, but I’d climbed these stairs hundreds of times and I was unconcerned. And in fact, I was doing fine until something pushed me hard from behind.\n\nBoth paintings went flying into the depths of the attic as I threw out my arms, desperately seeking to catch myself on the lip of the attic floor, or the flimsy railings of the stair, or anything. The shove was too strong and my movements too slow, and I could only windmill helplessly as the floor rapidly rushed up to meet my head.\n\nI woke up to Zoya shaking me and frantically calling my name.\n\n“I’m okay,” I slurred. I lifted my head, but the spike of pain that brought on caused me to instantly put it back down. There was a wet sound that confused me as I did that, like something was cushioning the hardwood floor. I raised my hand to my head and brought it away sticky. I was bleeding profusely.\n\n“The ambulance is on its way,” she told me. “Just stay there.”\n\n“There’s someone in the attic,” I said. I couldn’t let myself be taken out of the house without warning her about that. “There’s someone upstairs.”\n\n“You hit your head, baby. Just lie still. Help is coming.”\n\nI didn’t want to lie still. I wanted her to listen to me. I was so tired, though, and so I closed my eyes just for a minute. The last thing I saw before I woke up in the hospital was the curtain of blood slowly making its way out from my head, carpeting the hallway.\n\nThe doctors diagnosed me with nothing worse than a mild concussion and a nasty bruise, and sent me back home. I was told not to do anything strenuous for the next week, and warned specifically against things like ladders in case there was any lingering dizziness from the concussion.\n\nI spent my time listening intently to the noises of the house. Whoever was up there would have to creak a board or scrape against a box eventually. If I could figure out what part of the attic they were in, I’d be better equipped to challenge them once I was back on my feet.\n\nZoya inquired about my odd new habits, but I played them off as nothing to be concerned about. The person in the attic had already shown a propensity for violence when they’d pushed me down the stairs. Judging by the painting, they’d even been planning it. Who knew what they’d do to Zoya if they caught her up there? I couldn’t let her risk herself.\n\nAfter a week had passed, though, I had heard nothing definitive and I was tired of waiting. I armed myself with a crowbar and a Maglite, pulled down the attic trap door and headed back up the stairs.\n\nThe easel still sat against the back wall, bedecked with more paint splatters than ever. The paintings I had hurled away in my fall were stacked near it, leaning against the wall. Someone had moved them.\n\nI searched the attic from top to bottom, shoving boxes aside and jabbing my crowbar into corners. I checked the rafters and banged on the plywood panels covering the beams of the floor. I found nothing.\n\nFinally, I turned to the easel hiding under its sheet. It was the last place I hadn’t looked. I didn’t see how the intruder could be hiding under it, but I also didn’t see anywhere else he could be.\n\nWith a swift yank, I whipped the sheet aside. The easel tottered back and forth. The painting it held fell to the ground. There was no person there. There was nothing but three new paintings, the one that had fallen and one propped up against each leg.\n\nThe leftmost painting showed the entrance to my attic, exactly as it was. A woman’s head peered upward from the stairs. Her face was turned away, but her hair was styled like Zoya’s. Her attention was on something off to the side of the painting. She did not see the dark shape with the sharp blade behind her.\n\nThe painting on the right showed the far side of my attic, boxes stacked high in shadowy pillars. They framed the large window that let most of the natural light into the room. Through it, my large oak tree was visible. Two dark shapes hung from its branches, their necks bent at unnatural angles. The details were blurred by the thick glass of the window, but they were the right size to be my children.\n\nHeart pounding, I stood the final painting upright. It completed the triptych, showing the central portion of the attic. Unlike the others, it conveyed no direct threat. Instead, it showed only an empty easel with a bare wall behind it, not a painting to be seen.\n\n“What are you doing in the attic?” Zoya called from below me. I heard the stairs creak as she took the first step.\n\n“Stop!” I called out frantically. I had to keep her out. The painting’s statement was clear: if she discovered the easel, or if my children did, or if I tried to get rid of the art—my family would die.\n\nI cast about for an excuse as I rushed back to the stairs. On what pretext could I keep them all out of the attic? My mind seized on one that was close to the truth.\n\n“I’m setting up that art studio,” I told Zoya. I climbed down and shut the stairs behind me. “I don’t want you to see it until I have something to show you. It needs to be a separate space.”\n\nShe believed me, for why wouldn’t she? Encouraged me, even. Which means that several times a week, sometimes even daily, I trudge up these stairs and make my way across to that paint-spattered sheet, dreading what disaster I will find beneath this time.\n\nI have seen accidents both small and large, losses and failures aplenty. The worst, though, are the days when I take the sheet aside and see nothing but a blank canvas. Those are the days I have to paint my own destruction.\n\nZoya has not asked again to see my studio. She has been busy with the mishaps befalling our family. I would love to move, to throw it away, to burn it all down—but that threatening triptych hangs on the back wall of my attic, promising what will happen to everyone I love if I ever do.\n\nAnd so I paint, and I hope, and I dread.",

I trusted him so much I made a pact with him. I will allow him to enter my being, to soak my soul. In return, he would grant me eternal joy. He did not fulfil his promise.\n\nI don’t know what’s happening to me. I’ve lost track of time. I live in perpetual darkness. I can’t even tell you if it’s day or night outside. It has been so long.\n\nIt feeds on who I am. It takes my feelings away. It takes my memories away. Left behind is an empty shell that can barely be called human anymore. At times, I can’t even remember who I am. My entire persona is being diluted. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can’t go outside. It won’t allow me too. It tells me people will be mean to me outside, they will look at me in disgust, they will avoid me. It tells me there is nothing good outside, that it will only leave me shaken, exhausted and afraid, that I should stay here, with him. I obey.\n\nIn the past I used to write, mainly poetry for my loved ones. Now I’ve lost all my inspiration, all my imagination. The words have stopped coming to me. It took them away from me. This is likely to be my last piece. My swansong. \n\nThere is a mirror in my prison. I avoid looking my reflection. I can barely recognize myself anymore. It is eating me from within. My skin is turning grey. I’m so exhausted. I want to sleep my life away.\n\nI don’t know what I am fighting, but I’m losing the battle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don’t like to think too much about it. I know the he does not want what is best for me. I know he is a dark force, something you should avoid, something you shouldn’t be toying with, at risk of getting consumed. But I like his warmth. He comforts me in my distress. These days, I turn to him more and more often. He invites me to. My desperation causes him delight.\n\nHe is the only thing I can focus on. Everything else is blurry, clouded, hidden from my understanding. I used to have a sharp mind, to be curious, to empty entire bookshop shelves in a matter of weeks. It took that away too. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I wake up, I am drawn to the Light. I am told to look at it. It is the last thing I see before falling asleep. It is all I want to see. It is all I have left. I keep my eyes on it hours on end. Even if it burns. Just like a moth. \n\nThe Light has no will of its own, it is but a mirror of my own thoughts and fears. The Light shows me everything I couldn’t be. It shows me people happier than me. It shows me emotions I can’t experience anymore. I cannot detach my eyes from it. \n\nIt is trying to turn me sad. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSometimes she comes. In the past, she would come more often. I’m not sure. I can’t remember. I think I loved her at some point. I think she still loves me. I can’t reciprocate, he won’t allow me too. Now, all my love goes towards him. It hates her, and it tells me to hate her too. He says she despises me, he says she will forget about me soon, just like I forgot about her. Maybe he is right. Maybe she will stop coming.",

        "text": "I had always been close with my sister, but lately I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. My sister, Sarah, had always been a bit odd, with her interest in the occult and love for all things dark and mysterious. But lately, I couldn't shake the feeling that Sarah had changed. She seemed more distant, more secretive, and more obsessed with her interests. I tried to brush it off, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong.\n\nOne night, I woke up to the sound of chanting and followed the noise to the basement, where I found Sarah and Alex performing a satanic ritual. I was horrified and didn't know what to do. I confronted my sister, but Sarah denied everything and convinced me that I was just imagining things. I wanted to believe my sister, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong.\n\nDays turned into weeks and I couldn't shake off the feeling that something sinister was happening. I started noticing strange symbols etched on the walls, strange smells, and strange noises. I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched. I began to suspect that my sister had summoned some kind of demon or spirit, and that it was now possessing her.\n\nI tried to confront my sister again, but Sarah denied everything and convinced me that I was just imagining things. But as the days went on, Sarah's behavior became more erratic and violent. She would lash out at me for no reason, and I began to fear for my own safety. One night, Sarah attacked me in my sleep, and I was forced to flee my own home.\n\nI was terrified and didn't know what to do. I went to the police, but they didn't believe my story. I went to a priest, but he told me that my sister was possessed by a demon and there was nothing he could do. I was desperate and didn't know where to turn. I began to investigate on my own and found out that my sister had been dabbling in black magic and had summoned a demon to do her bidding. The demon had taken possession of my sister's body and was using her to carry out its evil plans.\n\nI was determined to save my sister and stop the demon. I gathered all the information I could and came up with a plan to exorcise the demon from my sister's body. I prepared myself for the ritual, but I knew that it would be dangerous. As I was about to start the ritual, I heard a knock on the door. It was Sarah, but something about her was different, her eyes were black, and she had a sinister grin on her face. She whispered \"I told you, you can't escape from me\" and the story ends with the uncertainty of what is going to happen next.\n\nAs I stood there, staring at my possessed sister, I knew that I had to act fast. I quickly began the ritual, reciting the incantations and performing the necessary actions to exorcise the demon. But as I reached the climax of the ritual, Sarah lunged at me, her eyes filled with rage. I managed to push her back and continue with the ritual, and to my relief, the demon's hold on her body began to weaken.\n\nBut just as the exorcism seemed to be working, the demon unleashed its full fury. The room shook, objects flew off the shelves, and a deep, otherworldly voice filled the air. The demon was not about to give up its host without a fight.\n\nI fought back with everything I had, determined to save my sister. I could see the conflict within Sarah, as if the demon and her were fighting for control of her body. But finally, the demon was vanquished, and Sarah collapsed on the floor, unconscious.\n\nI rushed to her side, relieved that the exorcism had been successful. But as I looked at her, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. Sarah had no memory of the demon possessing her, but I couldn't help but wonder if it was truly gone, or if it had left behind some kind of lasting effect.\n\nI stayed by her side, watching her closely for any signs of the demon's return. But as the days passed, Sarah seemed to be back to her old self, and I couldn't help but wonder if it was all just a figment of my imagination.\n\nBut as I lay in bed at night, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was still lurking in the shadows, waiting for the opportunity to strike again. The fear of the unknown, the fear of what the demon might be planning, and the fear of what it might do to my sister, consumed me.\n\nI decided to take matters into my own hands and started researching more about the demon that possessed my sister, I found out that it is known for jumping from host to host and that it takes control of its host's mind, making them do its bidding. I also learned that the demon is extremely powerful and that it is not easy to get rid of it.\n\nI was determined to protect my sister and to ensure that the demon would never harm her again. I began to prepare myself for the possibility of another possession and to be ready to exorcise the demon if it ever came back. But the fear of the unknown, the fear that the demon might come back stronger, and the fear that I might not be able to save my sister, haunted me every day. The story ends with me, the author, sitting in my room, researching and planning for the unknown, but always with the fear that the demon might come back for my sister and for me.",

        "text": "A loud, violent bang of metal against something large. The screech of tires and the car coming to a halt as I slammed the brakes and jolted upright, my blood running cold and my heart sinking in my chest. I stared out at the country back-roads through my windshield, the only illumination in the area from my headlights, the only sounds that of my quiet radio and the gentle rumble of the car engine. I sat in stunned silence for a second, my attention drawn to the few flecks of blood visible on the glass before me. \n\nThen, there came a long, pained groan from the front of my vehicle, high pitched and throaty. I swore under my breath as I sat up taller in my seat, trying to see what lay in front of my hood. I caught a glimpse of a large deer, laid on its side and weakly kicking at the air. Opening my car door, I stepped out into the cold night air and closed it behind me while I took tentative steps around to get a better look.\n\nThe animal was in a horrible state. I could see it was bleeding from its head, its body dented inward and three of its legs mangled. One was barely hanging on by a few strips of skin and muscle, flopping limply. I could see the vapour from its breath as it writhed in agony, giving a weak cry every few seconds. The blood around it formed a gradually larger puddle as it struggled against the apparent pain, reflecting bright in the headlights.\n\n“I’m sorry… I’m sorry… I didn’t see you, I didn’t see!”\n\nI muttered my apology without thinking, and it seemed for a second that the deer stopped struggling and looked me in the eyes, its battered chest rising and falling sporadically. \n\nMy gaze turned to the vehicle, the hood of which was badly damaged and steaming. Blood and tufts of fur stuck to the grill, which was busted out of shape. I was still a ways from home, but I wasn’t sure about driving it in that condition. What was I supposed to do then? Who do I call? For the deer, or my car for that matter? The animal clearly wasn’t going to make it, I didn’t need a vet to tell me that… I looked around in disbelief, my hands coming to hold my head. I had never been in an accident like this. Why did it have to happen tonight, and here? There were no streetlights on this road, with farmland to one side and woods on the other. \n\nAnother yell of pain came from the injured animal, taking my attention back to it. I gave my own stressed groan, venting some of my anxiety as I reluctantly knelt down a couple of feet from the doe, one hand on my car. At that point my free hand shot up to cover my mouth and nose, as a horrific stench hit my senses. I nearly gagged, choking on the offensive smell of rot that wafted my way. Was that the smell of the deer? Was it already sick before I’d hit it? Should I just put it out of its misery? It was clearly suffering horribly. As I watched it struggle, tears forming in my eyes from both the abject sadness of the scenario and the foul smell, I looked past the dying animal to the side of the road. I hoped I might spot a large rock, anything that might help spare the thing further pain, and myself from having to hear any more of those haunting agonised whines while awaiting help…\n\nAs I scanned across the edges of the road, I stopped and froze. Just at the boundary of the dark treeline, was a pair of eyes. Upon realising this, I did everything I could to remain perfectly still, because they were unmistakably locked upon me. I could tell - it knew, that I knew, it was there. That thought scared me for some reason, almost more than the fact that some strange creature was stalking me in the middle of the night. The deer whined, thrashing a little, which caused the thing to change its focus. I took the opportunity to move back a single step, but as my heart raced in my chest, I feared that sudden moves would provoke it. If it was a bear, it could easily run me down, even break into my car. It seemed to be about that size judging from where the eyes were, if it were on all fours. I didn’t have a gun or anything that would help me defend myself. I would be at its mercy.\n\nEven so, it still seemed to be captivated by the deer, which showed signs of slowing movement. Its cries were little more than breathy huffs, as blood bubbled from its lips and its head sat lazily on the asphalt road. It was surreal. I was sat there in my own headlights, watching this dying creature in the company of another, like it was some kind of sick show that the two of us were obliged to watch. Was it something karmic, that I had to wait and view the full consequences of my careless mistake?\n\nThese thoughts kept my head busy, as the two orbs of the watcher kept focus on the cervine victim. I tried my best to squint my eyes, to adjust to the darkness and make out more of what the creature dwelling on the edges of the shadowy forest might be. The eyes seemed to glow ever-so-slightly, and had a tinge of yellow to their colour.  I couldn’t make out any pupils, or the shape of the head beyond something that looked like it might be a snout.\n\nI jumped when the deer made its final sound, a long, drawn-out wheeze, that would prove to be its death-rattle. It lay still, then, bloody tongue slightly lolled out, legs limp. I wasn’t sure what this would mean for me, but I felt horrible that the creature had suffered the way it did. Such a long, drawn-out death, full of pain and fear… My fullest attention was brought back to the creature on the side of the road when it made its first real movement since I’d noticed its presence- simply, tilting its head. The motion seemed inquisitive, yet was accompanied by the sound of creaking and soft cracking, like stiff bones finally in motion. I swallowed hard, finding my throat sore and tight. My eyes stung from lack of blinking, which the creature itself had yet to do either. When I finally did, a quick deliberate motion to squeeze my eyes shut, it seemed to have prompted movement. \n\nIt wasn’t a bear. I don’t know what it could have been, but it wasn’t natural. It was some kind of abomination. Its head gradually emerged first, the dark outline of a humanoid face with an extended jaw, arms much-too long that reached forward in a slow, methodical fashion to allow it to creep towards me without jerky or fast movement. Each inch was painfully deliberate, the thing getting closer to the beam of the headlights, allowing me to make out more and more of its form. It’s skin was almost entirely a pallid yet dark grey, its body a distended, sickly-thin structure ending at the base of a spine and continuing into a boney tail, each hand and foot having only three digits, and greasy, stringy black hair upon its almost canine head that hung about its shoulders and back. \n\nMy lips parted as I trembled in place, my hand still upon the car which I felt like holding onto as some sort of life-line, the only real thing around me in that moment. The otherworldly smell of rot grew stronger the closer it got, sour and deathly. I felt like throwing up, from both fear and disgust, as it neared the side of the car opposite from me. Its eyes were on me for a brief moment, as mine filled once again with tears from the sickening smell, before it turned its head to the body of the deer. One spindly arm reached forward, steadily approaching, before finally entering the cone of light from my car. The skin of the hand appeared leathery and wet, with each of the three fingers ending in a black claw, almost like vulture talons. It prodded the doe, once then twice, awaiting any kind of reaction, but it was clear that the animal was now dead, the body lifeless.\n\nI considered trying to slip around the side of the car. I thought about sneaking away, seeing if there was any chance my engine still worked, so that I could drive away and never take this road again. But I couldn’t shake the thought that I was within arms reach of this thing- if it decided I was a target, it could easily lurch over the hood and grab me, and the way its movements were all so slow and careful, it was like it was saving energy, and so had plenty to spare for me… \n\nBut then, the claws reached for the deer’s head. They came to the face of the animal, one sharp digit lifting its eyelid open as far as it would go, before the other two suddenly dug their way into the socket with a sick, wet squelching, twisting as they pried the ball from its socket, then pulled back roughly enough to bring a long line of dangling pink nerves that once connected to the brain. I felt my stomach churning, bile at the back of my throat in response to the gruesome display, but it was far from over. The monster brought the eye to its mouth, which opened all at once with an additional wave of sheer stench, to reveal far too many eerily human teeth, lining the extended jaws. The canines were sharp, almost serrated, standing out from the rest. It slipped the eyeball onto its long black tongue, and as the jaws closed the muscle pushed the organ between the flatter of its teeth, causing it to briefly strain against the pressure, before popping into loose goo, bursting like a ripe tomato.\n\nI vomited, the smell of death and decay from its open maw along with the sickening display of its picky scavenging too much for me to endure, and so I emptied the contents of my gut down beside the tire as I let out a sobbing noise, coughing, prompting the creature to glance up at me briefly, before turning back to its meal. In one quick movement, it stabbed its claw into the deer's stomach, then split it open with eerie precision, causing blood, intestines and loose organs to spill forth. I wiped my mouth and nose, eyes wide and shaking, but now armed with the knowledge that it wasn’t interested in me, at least for now. Even still, I couldn’t take my eyes off the sight of it, as it forced ribs apart to get to vitals protected beneath, pulling them out and eating them like a gourmand. I took one step back, then another, moving away from the gory feast, until-\n\nA loud violent bang of metal against something large. The zoom of the car continuing on without stopping, as I am weightless for a moment, stunned and unable to comprehend what was happening, before hitting ground with a hefty thud. My finger twitches, and my mouth opens, only for me to give a breathless whimper of agony as it finally sets in. I felt dizzy. I couldn’t move my legs, could barely shift my arms, and any other motion brought overwhelming pain. Tears streamed freely down my face and onto the cold road, which gradually warmed with traces of my blood. My chest rose and fell with shallow inhales and unsteady exhales. I could taste copper on my lips, as I stared up at the night sky. Surely the person who hit me would stop, right? I told myself this, even as I could no longer hear the sound of their vehicle.\n\nI glanced to my side from where I lay, and could see the partially butchered corpse of the deer, and past it in the darkness, the creature. It had slunk back into the shadows, but was approaching once more. It titled its head as it looked at me, till it matched the angle at which I lay. This would be how I died, I realised. I would expire on this road in the cold, and be eaten by whatever this was. I wondered if there would be anything left of me when it was over. Would people just find my abandoned car, battery dead, with no sign of my body? Would I be another missing person's case? \n\nIt felt like I’d laid there for an hour. Gradually growing colder, paler, subjected to the ungodly stench and sight of the grisly feast, as piece by piece the deers organs and limbs were crushed between the teeth of the scavenger and swallowed. Every now and then it would look at me whilst eating, as if trying to tell if I was dead yet. I would blink in response, and it would turn its focus back to the meal. At one point I passed out, and I thought that was the end. I thought in that moment, there was nothing left of me. But then, a sharp prodding sensation woke me, causing me to breathe frantically for a moment and grunt a moan of pain and discomfort as I blinked back to consciousness, and watched the monster shuffle back past the headlights. I glanced to the deer, of which there was little more left than a broken spine and skull. It had eaten marrow from bone, and swallowed some parts of the skeleton whole.\n\nLooking back up to the monster, its eyes were soundly on me. It was a staring contest, as I fought to stay awake, to stay alive. I was thankful for what pain I could feel, as it was the main thing keeping me conscious, even as the cold numbed me further. I didn’t want to die, and sheer willpower and fear was what was keeping me from succumbing to my injuries. If I ever became unresponsive, the scavenger would surely devour me. I fought as hard as I could, forcing my eyes back open whenever they became lidded. I would even intentionally try to move, knowing it would bring another wave of hurt, just to shock myself back to lucidity. With my extreme injuries and the concussion I surely had, however, it wasn’t enough. After what may have been only minutes, or perhaps as long as hours, the darkness took me once more. \n\nDid you know that most knockouts last for less than a minute? If it lasts much longer than that, it's very likely permanent damage was done to the brain. It's apparently the same with fainting. It doesn’t last long…\n\nSuddenly my vision returned, though with a stinging sensation and tinge of red. My eyes gradually found focus, seeing a dark blurry shape through the crimson haze, before I felt the sharpness upon my brow, holding my eye open. The creature was right upon me, its bloody hands on my face, inches from blinding me permanently. I tried to muster the energy to scream, to try to fight, but it wasn’t from me that the sound ultimately came. The scream of an ambulance siren and its flashing lights rushed towards us, and in one swift motion, the scavenger released me. It fled towards the darkness, disappearing into the night. As the white and red van stopped and a pair of paramedics rushed to my side, asking questions and preparing a stretcher, I gave in once more to a sleep my body had been craving.\n\nAfter waking in the hospital, I was informed the driver who struck me had called an ambulance. Since that night, I have been making a gradual recovery from the physical injuries I sustained, and with enough therapy I’ll be able to walk again.. I did try to explain what had happened to those around me, but they are chalking it up to my head injuries. The infected scar on my eyebrow tells me otherwise. I don’t know if I'll ever drive again, but I definitely won’t be going anywhere near that road for as long as I live.\n\nJust be careful out there, I suppose. Try not to become roadkill.",

        "text": "It has happened before, and it will happen again. Sometimes it’s no big deal. Usually people ask though. The story this narrator used though.. It was different.. It was special..\n\nSo, just some quick backstory. I started writing nosleep stories about two years ago. I had stumbled upon a story called the left right game, and I was hooked from there. I started reading these stories regularly and eventually tried to write one of my own. \n\nMy first few didn’t get much attention. A few comments, a few other votes. About what I expected. Then, one kind of blew up.\n\nI wrote a story that was heavily based on some thing that really happened and just filled in the blanks with imagination. I had actually written it quickly and put a lot less effort in it than I did with my “duds”. It had a nice twist though. I had no idea how to end it and when it came to me, it was just perfect. \n\nAnyway, I posted the story. I woke up the following day to see over 1000 of votes and dozens of comments. I had an inbox full of requests to Translate and narrate my story. It was exciting. Aside from the fact that I didn’t feel that it was my best work, it was really nice to get some validation. \n\nIt would be a while before I had another story you get a decent amount of attention. I had written a handful that would reach right around 100 up votes. Not bad, but not that dragon I was chasing. \n\nEventually, I had a second story cross the thousands upvote threshold. Just like the first time, I started getting messages asking for permission to narrate the story on various YouTube channels and podcasts.\n\nAfter the first story came out, I gave permission to everyone who asked. I wanted to see a narrated version of my story. I wanted my story to reach a larger audience. A few pretty substantial Youtubers did it and it was cool.\n\nI knew they made money from their monetized accounts and that I wouldn’t make anything from the story, but I was all right with it at the time. It wasn’t the story I really wanted to write anyway. It was a twist ending with a weak narrative attached. Because of that, I wasn’t very attached to it myself.\n\nThe second story was different. I really liked it. I worked hard on it. I posted it, and it really took off (by my standards). I felt more attached to this piece of work. Because of that, I initially refused permission to those who asked to narrate it. I told them I hadn’t decided yet and that I was considering offering it to someone exclusively. Someone I was a personal fan of.\n\nMost people were very cool about it. They respected my wishes and didn’t narrate the story. They simply asked me to let them know if I were to change my mind. \n\nAbout a week had gone by, and I wanted to show a friend of mine my story. I’m a little shy and don’t show a lot of people at my work outside of the anonymous folks on the Internet. This was one of the few people I showed my stories to.\n\nInstead of going straight to it, for some reason I googled the title. I expected to see the Reddit post come up because the title was unique enough to not get buried in similar results. I didn’t though. I saw a link to a video on YouTube.. \n\nI clicked on the video. There it was. My story presented as an AI dictation. The person didn’t even narrate the story. They just had an AI read it for them. I wasn’t credited. There was no link to my Reddit page or the original story. You could briefly see my Reddit handle at the beginning of the video but you have to be looking for it.\n\nI was frustrated, especially when I saw how much engagement it had gotten. It had thousands of views and hundreds of comments. The channel itself had tens of thousands of subscribers. This video had 10 times the amount of engagement that my original story did. It also didn’t bring any traffic to my page. Once the story plateaued, the upvote count remained about the same despite the narration. \n\nI messaged the owner of the channel and asked them to take it down. They never responded. I hadn’t really taken any of this seriously before, but this was really bothering me. Not only did they take some thing of mine and use it without permission, but they were making money off of it. That, and they didn’t even read it themselves. They didn’t add anything to it.\n\nA good narrator can make a good story great. They can bring the characters to life. They can create a feeling of despair or suspense. This was not that. This was a robot reading a story and a YouTuber cashing in on it.\n\nEventually, it was clear that I wasn’t gonna get it taken down. I tried to tell myself it didn’t matter. I commented on the YouTube video that it was stolen, but the comment got no engagement. \n\nI tried to take my mind off it as I begin working on my next story. It was more difficult than I thought though. I just couldn’t stop thinking about it. Then one day as I was riding a bus home from work, something really odd happened.\n\nI was sitting in my seat typing on my laptop. I had one paragraph typed out that I kept deleting and re-typing. I felt like I had an idea, but I just couldn’t get going with it. I had this nagging anger at the back of my head. Why should I even be writing this? Someone else is going to benefit from it anyway. Some thief will get all the glory if there’s any to be had.\n\nThat’s when a stranger tapped me on the shoulder. I turned around to see an old man sitting in the seat behind me. He asked what I was writing and I explained it to him as best I could. I told him about the subreddit and about my previous stories. Then I told him about the narrator who used my work without permission. \n\nThat stopped him in his tracks. He seemed like a friendly guy. But when I told him about that narrator using my work, A look of anger took over his face. Almost rage.\n\n“That’s not okay!” He exclaimed. \n\n“I know that man,” I replied. “There’s nothing I can do about it though. I think it’s even giving me writer’s block.” \n\n“There’s always something you can do.. if you have the stones for it..”\n\n“Stones?” I asked. \n\n“Balls! Nuts! Guts!” He yelled, loud enough that a few other people on the bus started looking. \n\n“Okay, calm down man,” I said with a nervous laugh. \n\n“Can I tell you a story of mine?” He asked. \n\n“Sure.”\n\n“Oh, and you have my permission to use my story.. if you choose to,” he said in a creepy tone.\n\nI listened as he started telling the story. Then he stopped in the middle of a sentence. \n\n“Aren’t you going to write this down?“ he asked. \n\n“Oh.. uh. Yeah.” I replied, a bit flustered.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**This is the old man’s story, exactly as he told it.** \n\n*a&gt;“This happened years ago, when I was in middle school. English was my favorite subject in school. It was the only subject I was any good at.*\n\n*One day, teacher gave us a creative writing assignment. We had to write our own original, fictional story. I was ecstatic. I had such a vivid imagination and loved the idea of creative writing. I was excited to do something that I found fun for school.* \n\n*I started writing on the bus ride home. I didn’t even eat dinner that night. I just wrote and wrote and wrote. The story just flowed out of me. It was like I was supposed to write that story. Like it had been inside of me and the world would finally get to see it.* \n\n*I didn’t excel in any other classes aside from English. I wasn’t popular. I wasn’t good looking. I wasn’t athletic.* \n\n*I had never really felt validation for something I had done. I had never done something I could really be proud of. I never got those glory moments that other people got.* \n\n*There was a kid in my class who had a lot of moments I was envious of. Glory moments. His name was Lee. He was the star of the basketball team and had made buzzer beating shots. He went out with pretty girls. His parents were wealthy so he could show up to school in the nicest clothes and the latest fashions. He was charismatic and regularly cracked jokes that made the whole class laugh. He got to experience a lot of things that kids like me don’t get to. Moments of glory and validation..* \n\n*This story was going to be my moment. This was going to be the thing I was validated for. The teacher would be blown away by my imagination and my writing skills. The other kids in class would want to talk to me, realizing that I’m an interesting person who is just too shy to start a conversation.* \n\n*I worked through the night on the story. I didn’t sleep. I knew that I wouldn’t. I wouldn’t be able to do anything else at all until the story was finished. To this day I have never felt more creative than I did that night.* \n\n*I have never felt so confident either. This wasn’t just some kids' school project. This was a work of art that could rival the likes of Lovecraft, Asimov, Shelley, ect!*  \n\n*By Tuesday morning, my story was finished. It was much longer than the assignment required, and we had until Friday to turn it in, but I was too excited to wait.* \n\n*I arrived at school Tuesday with my masterpiece in my backpack. The first part of the day might’ve been the happiest I had ever been in that school. I anxiously awaited English class. It would be the day that I got my moment of glory, my moment in the spotlight.* \n\n*By this point, you can probably infer from my language that I didn’t get that moment. It was almost time for English class when Lee and his friends confronted me in the bathroom. This was no rare occurrence. Lee was a textbook bully. He was a cliché.. and honestly.. so is what happened..* \n\n*There were three of them. They pushed me down. They beat the hell out of me. Lee kicked me in the stomach over and over and over. He kept me so many times that I couldn’t believe his foot didn’t hurt from it.* \n\n*Then they started rifling through my backpack. They poured the contents all over the bathroom floor. Some notebooks, pens and pencils, and my story..* \n\n*With his foot on my chest, Lee picked up the stapled stack of papers. He flipped through a little bit and realized what it was. Then he looked down at me and smiled before saying “Thanks for doing my homework for me, bud!”* \n\n*To make a long story short, the predictable happened. Teacher didn’t believe me when I said that Lee stole my story. They didn’t know he was a bully. He did very good mask work. He could make the teachers think he was an angel when I knew he was the goddamn devil..*\n\n*When the teacher read the story, she was absolutely blown away. She read it aloud to the class and they applauded afterward. Everyone was in awe of this amazing and engaging story.* \n\n*Lee had a grin on his face from ear to ear as everyone complimented him on his phenomenal work. The teacher even started talking about getting him into programs for exceptional students..* \n\n*I felt numb as I watched Lee bask in my moment.. he had already experienced so many of these moments. He probably took them for granted. He had no idea what he had taken from me. No one did. No one believed that the dirt bag trailer park kid wrote this masterpiece.* \n\n*I skipped my next class. I just went out back of the school and started throwing rocks at the side of the brick building. As I was doing this, the school janitor approached me.*\n\n*I talked with him from time to time. Not often, but more than most of the kids. I think he took pity on kids like me who didn’t have friends. That, and he’d probably rather talk to someone who treated him like a person, rather than insulting him the way a lot of the other students did.* \n\n*He asked me what was wrong. I told him that I didn’t expect him to believe me because no one else did, but I told him what had happened.* \n\n*Surprisingly, he did believe me. He believed that I wrote the story, and he was one of the few adults at the school who knew how big of an asshole Lee was. He said that he could help. He asked me to meet him in the same spot the following day. He said that he would bring me something.*\n\n*I went home and sat in my room. I skipped dinner. I avoided talking to anyone. I decided that if I could write a great story once, I could do it again. I was going to sit down and I was going to write another story, a better story!*\n\n*Or so I thought.. I had nothing. I tried to focus my mind on a story but all I could think about was Lee smiling while the class clapped and cheered. I tried to come up with an original idea but all I could think of was how Lee stole my story, stole my moment, stole my glory!* \n\n*I ended up writing nothing that night. I just sat there angry at the world, angry at the teachers who didn’t believe me, angry at Lee.*\n\n*The next day at school I felt like a zombie. I was a pretty quiet kid as it was, but now I just felt empty. Like someone let the air out of me.* \n\n*The day was a blur, but after school I went out back and the janitor was there waiting. He asked if I had written anything more the previous night and I told him that I hadn’t. I told him that I couldn’t think about anything other than Lee stealing my story.* \n\n*That’s when he said something that I never forgot. He said “If Lee is all you can think about, then write about Lee.”* \n\n*He then handed me an old notebook. It was dirty and the pages had started to turn yellow. He told me that someone had given it to him a long time ago.* \n\n*“Write about him in there,” he said. “Whatever thoughts you have bouncing around in your head right now, write them down in that book. Keep it open until you’re finished and make sure you’re positive that you’re finished. Then close it and leave it closed for at least a full day.”*\n\n*I found it a little strange. Especially the specifics of keeping the book open while writing it and leaving it closed after being finished. Although I assumed it was simply a writing technique of some sort. I assumed the janitor was just trying to jar something loose for me.* \n\n*Either way, I wrote about Lee. I wrote the story of a mean boy who had everyone else convinced he was an angel. A wolf in sheep‘s clothing who went around making others' lives miserable. I wrote about Lee stealing a sad, shy boy’s story when all that boy wanted was his one moment..* \n\n*I wrote this in pieces, keeping the journal open in my locker. I basically just wrote what had happened over the previous week. When I got to the point where I was at the present, I wasn’t quite sure what to write next. Maybe this was the point of the exercise. Maybe the janitor told me to do this so I could work through my emotions?* \n\n*The final bell rang as the last period ended and all the kids went rushing out the door. I left the journal open in my locker because I felt like it was the safest place.* \n\n*As I started walking home, and began hearing footsteps behind me growing louder and faster. I started walking faster, but I knew what was about to happen. I tried to ignore it until I heard Lee say “I know you tried to squeal on me!”* \n\n*I started running but I didn’t get far. They tackled me. Again, they beat the piss out of me. The kind of ass whooping that would get a kid thrown in jail today.* \n\n*They pinned me on the ground with my face in the dirt. Lee said “If you can’t keep your dirty little mouth shut, then we’ll help you out!”* \n\n*The other two boys held my arms behind my back while Lee shoved dirt into my mouth. Handful after handful. I was coughing and choking on it trying not to swallow it. I was gagging and he wouldn’t stop. He just kept grabbing handfuls of dirt and shoving  it into my face. It was like being waterboarded… I imagine.*\n\n*It was traumatizing. It was worse than anything they had done to me before. They still beat my ass. They just also tried their damnedest to suffocate me with dirt and mud..*\n\n*When they finally let me go, I stayed on the ground for several minutes, sobbing, choking, and vomiting. When I finally got up, I didn’t go home. I went back to the school.* \n\n*I grabbed the janitor’s notebook out of my locker. I walked to a nearby river and sat on the bank. Then I finished my new story.* \n\n*I was so angry.. I was in so much pain. My face and clothes were still covered in dirt, saliva, and some puke as I wrote down my thoughts.* \n\n*I wrote about Lee and his friends attacking me. Then I wrote about bad things happening to them..* \n\n*Shortly before all of this, I learned about a condition called “locked in syndrome”. That is true horror to me. Being in a coma and being fully aware, able to feel, but unable to move, speak, communicate, ect..*\n\n*I wrote about a day in class where Lee randomly started convulsing. He begins to seize and his buddies both piss their pants as it’s happening. His friends get sick, but eventually recover.*\n\n*Lee doesn’t though. Lee falls into a coma and develops locked in syndrome. For the rest of his days, he lays in a hospital bed in constant pain, fully aware but unable to control his body. Also, his nose really itches.. and it never stops itching.* \n\n*Each day when his feeding tube is inserted, he thinks about the boy he attacked and force fed dirt. He considers what that must have felt like. How painful.. How scary.. How powerless he must have felt as he gasped for air. Lee thinks about that boy everyday of his never ending torture.* \n\n*Then I closed the notebook.. I didn’t think twice about it. There was dirt on the pages that fell from my face. I wanted Lee to suffer..* \n\n*..The next day.. it happened.. Right in the middle of class, Lee began convulsing and fell to the floor. We all looked on in horror as the teacher frantically called for help.* \n\n*His friends both peed their pants, not that many people noticed. Everyone was focused on Lee. The nurse came and tried to help while they waited for the paramedics..* \n\n*He fell into a coma.. and he never woke up.. Last I knew, he was still in a hospital bed presumably praying for someone to itch his nose.. I visited once. I couldn’t stay long.. I gave his nose a little scratch, and I left.. I never saw him again after that.*\n\n*Ironically, this made Lee sort of a celebrity at our school and in our town. He got a full page in the yearbook, candle light vigils, moments of silence, and so on.. In my pursuit of one moment of glory and recognition, I turned Lee into the most well known kid in town.* \n\n*Maybe I did.. I never really fully understood what had happened. Could it have been the most ridiculous coincidence? Did the janitor do something to him? Was this book.. magical?* \n\n*I never found out. I sought out the janitor, but was told that he no longer worked at the school. I couldn’t find him because I didn’t know his name. I had spoken with him many times, and never asked what his name was..*  \n\n*I couldn’t bring myself to open the notebook again. I always kept it with me though. I struggled with my feelings about what happened. I felt guilt, but I wanted vengeance and I got it.* \n\n*I didn’t write again after that. I never made another attempt at my “masterpiece”. I felt shame. I felt guilt. But at the same time.. watching him seize up, watching my words become reality, that was the closest I got… That was my glory moment.. Lee was my masterpiece..”*\n\n**This was apparently the end of his story.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was a pause as the old man finished his story. He seemed caught between emotions. One moment he looked guilty and sad. The next, he seemed happy and satisfied.. After probably a full minute, I broke the silence. \n\n“That’s a very poetic way to tell me that you’re a psychopath,” I laughed. \n\n“Maybe so,” he replied, also laughing. “I guess we’re all the hero of our own story.. It can get murky sometimes, though.” \n\n“Do you regret writing what you did about Lee?” I asked. \n\n“That’s a question I’ve never been able to answer.. I think about it every day. Maybe I could’ve got some writing done or at least have done something more productive with my time. I trapped myself though.. the same way I trapped Lee..”\n\n“Is that the moral of the story?” I asked.\n\n“I’m not sure,” the man replied. “Maybe the moral is simply that there are things in this world that we’ll never understand until we learn about them. Some things we won’t ever understand. Things we can’t perceive that might exist all around us. A tv would seem like magic to a caveman. Who knows what really is or isn’t possible in this world?” \n\n“I gotta ask, why are you telling me this story?” \n\n“Because you remind me of myself back then. They took your idea. You created something from nothing. You had a seed of an idea and you nurtured it. You raised it to be a strong tall oak. And they pulled out their chainsaws and cut it down…”    \n\nThe man then grabbed the backpack from the floor between his legs and pulled out an old notebook. It looked ancient. It was dirty, yellow, and falling apart.\n\n“She ain’t what she used to be, and she wasn’t much then,” the man laughed. “She’s special though. If you want her, she’s yours.” \n\n“Why?” I asked. “I don’t und..\n\nHe interrupted me.\n\n“You know why..” he said somberly. “The choice is yours. I gotta go now. This is my stop..”\n\nMoments later, the bus stopped and the man got up and exited. It seemed weird that his story and explanation took exactly as long as he’d be on the bus. Maybe he just got off at a random stop for dramatic effect? Maybe he isn’t sure where he’s going.. Either way, he left the notebook in his seat. \n\nI picked up the notebook and opened it. I leafed through it and saw empty pages. Not one word was written in it. Just blank, old, yellowing pages.\n\nI re-read the man’s story on my laptop for the rest of the ride. I was more confused than anything. His story seemed like a warning, yet he gave me the notebook. \n\nHe seemed both happy and sad. Both guilty and proud of what he’d done.  Maybe it was just an idea for a writing exercise. What if what you wrote about really happened? I’m not sure. He said everyone is the hero of their own story, but hero’s don’t put people into comas.. do they? \n\nMy stop finally came. I made my way back to my apartment. I sat at my desk continuing to stare at the story on my laptop. It was bugging me. I couldn’t figure out the point of the story. \n\nMaybe it’s that revenge isn’t the answer. What the man did to Lee may have been his greatest triumph, but it was also his curse. It consumed him. Maybe I just need to learn to forgive and to not sweat the small stuff. Vengeance isn’t the answer. I guess that’s what I’m taking from it.\n\nI decided that I needed to step away from the story. Take my mind off it and revisit it later. I should’ve stepped away from the laptop altogether. Instead I decided to check on my latest story to see if it had gained any attention.\n\nI already had my story up on my phone. I refreshed it to see that the upvote count remained the same. There were no new comments. Nothing. The story remained a dud. \n\nI then googled the title. I wish I hadn’t. I previously had a popular story of mine get narrated without convent. It hadn’t really happened with a dud though.. \n\nThe top result was a series of videos on tictok. I clicked and saw an AI generated narration of my latest dud. Then I saw how many views it had.. Thousands. The user who posted it had tens of thousands of subscribers. There were more than a hundred comments. \n\nThe comments were the worst part. My story was a stand alone, but the tictok user had to break it up into parts. Most of the comments were eagerly asking for the next part. The next part of a story they could go read in its entirety if they knew where to find it. There was no link though. No credit to me or my page. Just a stolen story.\n\nOther comments complimented the tictok user on their writing. It felt somewhat nice knowing that I had written it, but was maddening that it was presented in a way that made it seem that the tictok user wrote it. \n\nI read every single comment on every part of the story. I then found others of mine that this user had taken without permission. Stolen content for their monetized channel while my page and original stories sat desolate of any engagement. \n\nI was so angry as I read comment after comment. I am the hero of my story! This thief is the villain! They get the credit, the money, the compliments… the glory..\n\nI don’t believe in magical things. I don’t believe in supernatural things. That’s why I pulled the old empty notebook out of my bag. I opened it up and stared for awhile at the blank, frayed pages. \n\nI chewed the end of my pen as I looked back and forth from the comments in the tictok video and the blank pages of the notebook. \n\nFinally, I took a deep breath and started writing in the notebook. Maybe the old man was simply trying to jar loose the masterpiece I had inside me. Maybe this could be my masterpiece..\n\n*a&gt; “There once was a tictok user with a large following. A content creator who didn’t possess the ability to create content of their own, so they used other people’s work to satisfy their many subscribers. Their stolen content gained them wealth and influence. They had no idea that something horrific and painful was about to happen to them.. With every like, comment, or new subscriber, the agony would increase…*",

        "text": "Before I tell you what I’m about to tell you, you need to understand two things.\n\nFirst, I do not know how to swim. When you live in the place I do, it’s more or less a ‘useless’ skill. I mean, the deepest water around is up to my shoulders at best, can you really blame me? I can’t say where I’m from for obvious reasons, but just know that most of it is a very arid, very empty desert with a whole lot of nothingness. Water is life here, and it's evident in that if you stray too far off the beaten path and away from water, you WILL get lost and you’ll be lucky if anyone sees you again before sundown. My village is settled neatly between two gentle rolling mesas and along a thin river in a sparsely populated community lovingly called the ‘valley’.\n\nThis place is old, very very old. The kind of old that you can feel setting in your bones when you walk along the same dirt roads that have been used for a few hundred years. Most of the community has been here since before ‘America’ was even a thing, and definitely much before we became a part of it. Save for a few transplants that descend from the city to retire, everyone is family, even if all-in-all we are far and few between. The nearest ‘big’ city of a few thousand is an hour away.\n\nBut that leads me to the second thing you need to know: I loved Isabella, a lot. We were sister-cousins; she was my mom’s sister’s kid, my cousin, but we grew up close enough to be sisters. It may sound weird if you’re not from a family like mine or a community as tight-knit as ours, but we were always together. Because of how condensed our village is, we were also neighbors, classmates, and altar girls at church together. I saw her more than my own parents and it was the same for her. She was two months older than me, and always seemed to hold that fact over my head as some sort of superiority thing. Whatever. But we were close.\n\nWe fought a lot, like real sisters, and she could be the snootiest brat ever if given the opportunity. But I loved her then and I still do.\n\nWe did everything together. School, catechism, sleepovers, meals. For how much we butted heads you’d think we wouldn’t want to spend so much time together, but it was the opposite. That was our ‘love’. \n\nBut by far, our favorite thing to do together was visiting the river. Beyond the bend of the fields, and right down the road from our grandmother’s, you could find the ‘heart’ of the river, the place where it was its widest. The river itself is shallow most of the year, up to my hips everywhere except for the heart–there, it almost got up to my neck. Even better, right at the mouth of it was a gentle rolling waterfall that was smooth and eroded enough to go down kind of like some sort of natural water slide. It was so overgrown with moss that it was pretty comfortable, and we’d ‘race’ each other as we slid down (I always won, as the stockier one obviously). The river used to be much deeper apparently, by around ten to fifteen feet if what every old person in my life has claimed is true. But it's still fun.\n\nAs young kids, it was kind of the local youth hangout spot. Any summer day we went, there was guaranteed to be at least a few other kids running around in ragtag hand-me-down shorts on its shores, and we’d all play together, share some sodas, and then walk each other home. It was awesome. It’s relatively safe in the daytime here, so we’d never need permission or someone to watch us. But as we got older, fewer and fewer people came, and now it's rare to see even a single person there.\n\nMaybe that’s for the best.\n\nBut back then, when it was just me and Bella, we’d have so much fun. We’d swim until we were tired and our fingers had pruned up like raisins, and then we’d lounge out on the shore and enjoy the warmth of the sun. From sunrise to sunset, we’d spend all of our time there, eating bologna sandwiches my mom packed us and talking about life–who was dating who, how annoying our other siblings were, what the future had in store for us. It was great.\n\nAnd basically every time, we’d dare each other to swim over the ‘hole’ as it was ominously called. The ‘hole’ was the deepest part of the river, right beneath the edge of the waterfall where the water curled and formed a tiny whirlpool. The hole itself was only wide enough to reasonably fit a slim adult, and its depth was unknown. The rock underfoot surrounding it would immediately drop off into a very cold, dark nothingness. We’d joke that it went to the center of the earth, and we’d try so hard to go to the bottom. We never did. I think that no one ever will, and I can only pray for whoever tries.\n\nBut back then, we’d always attempt it. \n\nThis is where that part about me not knowing how to swim is important. See, we’d always dare each other to swim over the top of it and drop down as far as we could before we had to come up for air. And I always won because I \\*always\\* cheated. I’d take a comically big breath and do some obnoxious underwater squat to make it seem like I had really gone down, would even flail my arms and let my breath escape as bubbles for dramatic effect so it was believable. Isabella was none the wiser. It wasn’t like I could have admitted that I couldn’t swim–it would have been just another thing she’d hold over my head as the ‘inferior’ sister.\n\nYet she’d try her best but never got farther than me, until the time she actually did. I’ll come back to that. Maybe she also didn’t know how to swim and cheated too, and was somehow worse at doing that than me, or maybe she just really sucked at swimming. It doesn’t matter.\n\nAnd after, after the sun had started to dip under the horizon and the mosquitoes started to get nasty, we’d share a towel (because she always forgot hers) and walk down the road to our grandma’s. She was a much older lady and didn’t speak much English, but she was the most comfortable person I’ve had in my life. She’d chastise us for being out with wet hair when the temperature was dropping so suddenly with the onset of dusk and ushered us in to shower and curl up around the wood stove. By the time we were all clean and in comfortable clothes, she’d have hot cocoa ready on the stove for us. We’d warm up with a cup, and ‘cause grandma didn’t have a TV, she’d tell us stories to fall asleep to until our parents came for us.\n\nShe had the best stories, and despite the language barrier, they were enthralling.\n\nMost of them were scary, I won’t lie; crying ghosts of dead mothers treading the river shore, unspeakable monsters waiting in the abandoned mines on the mesas, of the old man with the black hat that would wait outside your window if you stayed up late. They were intended to be lessons, I know that now, but she would spin them so creatively. I wish I could remember them as vividly as she told them, because maybe if I had Isabella would still be here.\n\nThe most important one was of the big great monster beneath the river.\n\nI’d brag about beating Bella in our faux competition in the hole, and she’d just frown this deep, unhappy old lady frown and sigh with the weight of decades upon decades. \n\n‘Don’t mess around in that river, *mija*. Nothing good down there.’\n\nShe'd tell us that you couldn’t swim over it if you were one of three things; a very young child, a pregnant woman, or if you were menstruating. All very strange conditions. Because evidently, there was something deep and bad and terrible in the hole, and it fed on the young. Because a very long time ago, back when the world was all animals and spirits, coyote had stolen the beast’s young, and now it needed to feed in revenge. When I was a little older she’d add on to it, talking about how her mother warned her about it when she was a little girl because one day, while pregnant, she had slipped while wading during the dry season and fallen into the hole, and the very next day, the baby was gone. Just like that.\n\nI asked my mom once, and she chalked it up to grandma remembering a miscarriage her mother had weirdly on account of her age. It sounded plausible, but now, I think grandma was right.\n\nWhen it happened, we’d been older. It was a year ago, almost to the date. Grandma had passed three years before. We hadn’t seen each other in nearly two years because of the pandemic and us moving away for school. \n\nIsabella and I went to the river, the same as we did every summer, though less frequently than we had in years passed. If the old people had complained about the river’s depth before, they would have been miserable with it then. It was the shallowest it had been in my entire life. Hardly up to my thighs in the thick of it. The stream was light, practically stagnant, and the waterfall was but a slow trickle threatening to dry up altogether. This place had been in a drought since long before my time, but never had it been so bad.\n\nUsually, there was a brief flood period every spring that would leave the river full enough to not dry out before winter. Not this time.\n\nThe river was suddenly a ghost of what it once was. Shallow and still and devoid of any local life like it used to have. It was quiet, unnaturally so with nothing but the singing of cicadas and the soft bubbling of the river to fill the void. The community as a whole had been getting smaller and smaller with every passing year, and the river was truly symbolic of that.\n\nBella and I still made it work. We rolled out our towels and tanned, splashed around a bit, and ate the same bologna sandwiches we’d been having since we were kids. And then she reminded me.\n\n“Hey, remember that game we’d play with the hole?”\n\nI shrugged. “Sure, the one you always lost at?”\n\nThe comment earned a punch to the shoulder but she still laughed and nodded in its direction. “Wanna try for old times’ sake?”\n\nOf course, I said yes, and between giggling and trying to shove each other into shallow murky water, we waded over to the usual spot. Even with kicked-up sand and stagnant water, it still stood out like an inky black portal hiding all of its secrets beneath the surface. I still didn’t know how to swim, and the water was too shallow for me to cheat and squat like I’d always done, so I suggested she go first.\n\n“Oh? Scared you’re going to lose?” Was all she said before pinching her nose and dropping in. It was the last thing she’d ever say to me.\n\nI really had expected her to comically sink down to just her chin and laugh, proving for once and for all that the hole was not in fact bottomless and had just seemed like it was so because of our lack of depth perception and childhood fantasy. But she didn’t. No, she slipped right beneath the surface of the water without so much as making a ripple. It was quiet. Painfully, unnaturally quiet. Several seconds passed, and then a minute.\n\n“Bella?” I called. “You made your point, you can come up now!”\n\nNothing.\n\nI started to panic. Really, really panic. I still couldn’t swim but I was scared, so I did the best thing I could think of. I crawled closer, sat on its edge, and for the first time ever, actually dipped my entire leg beneath its rim and into the ice-cold abyss beneath. I tried to squint and see but the light flesh of my leg disappeared in its depths, and if it wasn’t for the chills wracking my body from the sheer cold of it, I might have worried about it disappearing too.\n\nI tried to feel her out, but nothing. I’d reached at least three feet down and there was nothing but ragged, tight stone walls to scrape my toes against. My heart dropped and I started to breathe harder, desperately shouting her name and trying to reach deeper.\n\nI could feel a light tug, like some sort of suction. A force pulling me down, deeper almost. It had always been there. As a kid, it had somehow felt stronger, but now it acted as a mere suggestion. \n\n‘*Come down, a little more*’, it was like some inaudible voice had whispered.\n\nAnd then there was a hand grabbing my ankle tight enough to hurt, icy and firm. I screamed and struggled to stand up, desperate to get away. And as I pulled my leg up and away from the hole, so with it came Isabella. As soon as I recognized her, I grabbed her from the water and pulled her up, crying and sobbing out apologies.\n\nAt first, she seemed fine, just looking around dazed with glossy eyes and this sullen-like expression. I held her face and kept repeating her name but it was like she couldn’t focus. And then she coughed, dark, murky water spilling from her lips. And it kept and kept until I was sure she was going to choke. It stopped, but there Isabella was, now twenty pounds lighter and violently shaking. She fell over and that was when I noticed. The skin of her feet was gone. All of it. Scraped away like she’d been the victim of some bad accident, leaving twitching, throbbing muscle and tendon beneath. Bone peeked out and that was when I saw it–little pocks where the red-stained bone was, marring it unnaturally. Teeth marks.\n\nSomething had been *gnawing* on her.\n\nThe rest was a blur. \n\nAt some point, I called the police to send an ambulance. But if you know how inaccessible rural communities are, you know how long it takes. Thirty goddamned minutes spent holding my shaking, catatonic sister on the same shore we’d safely played on for years before.\n\nThey came, not soon enough, but they came, and I had to watch as she was wheeled away.\n\nIt would be the healthiest I’d see her for the rest of her short life.\n\nShe died five days later from severe dehydration and organ failure. Ironic, right?\n\nIn her last days, Isabella was manic, scared, and so utterly violent she had to be restrained and sedated. She’d stopped speaking in any recognizable way, and her eyes stayed unfocused and glossy till the very end. I visited her as soon as I could, but she’d already been too far gone, not recognizing me for more than a few seconds before shrieking. I only knew about the rest of it after talking to her parents, my aunt and my uncle. Bella had developed hydrophobia–a real, visceral aversion to water. She couldn’t be bathed and refused water to the point that they had to give her an IV, which she promptly pulled out. Only to see her own blood and make the connection that that too was water, before completely mutilating herself with just her fingernails in an attempt to remove it. She’d been restrained and sedated after that until she took her last breath. \n\nThe next day, it flooded worse than it had in years.\n\nThe most reasonable conclusion they could come up with was that she’d somehow contracted rabies or some sort of brain-eating amoeba months before and that it had started to truly manifest after she’d scraped her feet while diving. They wanted to run an autopsy to test her brain, but if they did I don’t know. My aunt and uncle moved away a few weeks after her passing, and our village is lonelier than ever now.\n\nEveryone was willing to pass it off as some freak accident, but I couldn’t. I dreamt of my sweet Bella a lot, of her cold, lifeless sunken eyes that had bore into me in the days before she died. I know that some \\*thing\\* did this to her. That chill in that hole was unnatural, unearthly. A sharp, painful contrast to the otherwise sun-warmed river. Like it wasn’t even water down there but something else, something thinner and sinking.\n\nIt’s been calling to me, literally.\n\nI’d been taking the dogs out for a bathroom break one evening about a month ago, and I’d heard it. Splashing, and a lot of it, from the ditch situated between the road and our house. We get beavers in them sometimes, so I’d trudged over to look, only to find that the ditch was empty. Not just of beavers, but of water too. I had forgotten that they’d shut them off because of the drought. I tried my best to move past it but I kept hearing it, that horribly familiar splashing like flailing arms trying to climb out of that hole every goddamn night. \n\nI had remembered our grandma’s story and cursed myself for not having her around to ask about it now. So I did the next best thing and looked at the local censuses. I pulled several all-nighters pouring over them, every document written and published for our village over the past several hundred years, just looking and searching for some sort of answer, until finally, it happened. I saw the pattern.\n\nEvery few years in this place there were accounts of it. Of little kids and babies disappearing into the river. And after every bout of them, there was a flood and intense summer rains like clockwork. All the way until the past fifty years. Suddenly, fewer and fewer kids died, just because there weren’t as many around. As we slowly depopulated, just from folks moving away, there were less people and less kids. I’d noticed it in my lifetime too, how there were half as many now as there were when I was that age. I didn’t get it at first, but now I do.\n\nShortly after my realization, the river started calling my name. It would start as odd garbled sounds that were hardly recognizable, until eventually, it was a full-blown whisper in some horrible, wretched tongue I’d never been witness to. \n\n‘*Cass,’* it would whisper and cry every single night, an alluring noise that pulled me to seek out that dark, damp hole again.\n\nI felt like I was going crazy. Maybe I was grief-stricken and losing my shit after months of trying to heal—that’s what I’d thought. I had to make a mistake to eventually realize the truth.\n\nI fucked up, but I get it.\n\nIt took me venturing to that godforsaken place again. I was upset and not in my right mind, still mourning Bella’s absence in my life after I came home for the summer and it wasn’t the same. And so in a fit of hysterics, I stood over that inky black hole in the middle of one lazy, overbearing afternoon, and I stepped in.\n\nI’m sure Bella was looking up at me from the afterlife, cursing me for being stupid enough to follow her. But I had to. And I know now.\n\nI slipped under the surface and there was that force, slowly dragging me down and consuming me in an instant. I don’t know how long I was down there. It couldn’t have been long, I didn’t drown after all. I was pulled impossibly deep, deep beneath the hole and rock and slate into some forbidden place that none should speak of. It felt like just a moment, but it was long enough to feel \\*it\\*.\n\nIt doesn’t have a name I can say. There aren’t words to really describe It as more than a feeling, but It is a Thing. An ancient, hungry Thing. I felt Its presence like a bad omen, and I instantly knew of what It was. \n\nIt is a being far, far older than me, than grandma, and the village, and maybe even the mountains. It speaks in some sort of universal language that I could never reciprocate even if I tried, and in it, It whispered Its name. I’ll never forget that sound. Clear as a bell, even within the deep murky waters.\n\nAnd then It started to eat, and I realized.\n\nIt fed, and It fed on young blood. This Thing, be it God or Demon or something older than either of those Things was ravenous, and tied to its hunger was the very waters that served as the lifeblood of my home. In an instant, a history of the land flashed through my brain. It had been known before when humankind first settled here and sought Its benevolence. \n\n‘*If you take care of me, I will take care of you.*’\n\nAll those kids. All those babies. Grandma’s mother. The sudden drought. It all made sense.\n\nAnd before I could even comprehend it, that Thing spit me out, seemingly disgusted by my aged flesh and blood.\n\nNot all the way, because I had to claw my way up, up, and through that claustrophobic hole until I could breathe again.\n\nWhen I pushed out of the water, my skin had gone white from the cold and blood loss. I fainted after that. \n\nI woke up hours later in a sterile, painfully white hospital room to my mother sobbing over me and a doctor trying to explain to my half-conscious form what had happened. I was told I was lucky I was found when I was after some fisherman had stumbled upon me and sped to the ER.\n\nAnd then the bad news. My entire left foot and three of my toes had to be taken.\n\nIt was a shock, it didn’t feel real. It still doesn’t. I get phantom pains where those parts of me should be, forgetting until I try to stand up and fall over. I was closely monitored, especially after what happened to Bella. And for a while, I truly did think I was going to die the same way she had.\n\nEvery time anyone spoke, it was like I was trying to understand them from three feet underwater. I swear, I could only *think* in that awful, evil language I’d heard. And then it started, the hydrophobia. It’s hard for me to rationally explain.\n\nThe first time, a nurse had tried bringing me a cup of water and I’d instinctively screamed ‘no!’ and swatted it away. And then I couldn’t drink anything. Couldn’t bathe without screaming myself unconscious, and I couldn’t even think of water without breaking into a cold sweat—until I didn’t have enough water in my body to even do that. It hurt. I was convinced this was it. I had an innate fear of water, and now I was going to slowly dehydrate to death just like Bella. \n\nAnd just like her, it rained the entire week after. \n\nI think that I might have just been over the cusp of being too old for that Thing to devour. Isabella had been a year younger than me when It bit her, and though we both developed this sickness, I got better. Because after three days, words started being coherent again and I was slowly able to reintroduce myself to water. \n\nOr maybe It chose me for a reason.\n\nTo this day, I try to touch water less, even now. Because when I touch it or drink it, I can feel It thrumming deep beneath the ground, in this massive, underground lake where It calls to me. I shower far less than I probably should and only drink water when absolutely necessary. I’ve made life bearable by keeping myself on the brink of dehydration constantly. It sounds horrible, and I’ve heard the hushed rumors going around about how unsightly I’ve become, but I don’t care. Because It whispers my name every night, calls for me to come down and venture into Its depths. It’s got a job for me, and I’m scared. \n\nI’m scared because I have a choice to make. After my venture in, it rained so good and hard for the first time in weeks that for the first time in a while, the whole valley was flush and lively. I don’t think I had seen it like that since I was very little and we still had a monsoon season. I’ve seen what It does now. Even a taste of my spoiled, old blood was enough for a feat like that, and even the river rose higher. It was a display. A promise.\n\nAbout a week ago, a new family moved in. They aren’t from here at all, and in a familiar closed-minded fashion, my community probably won’t take to them. We don’t like outsiders.\n\nThey have kids. Lots of them. I’ve seen them. They live across from my grandma’s old house. Sometimes they play in the river, wading around obliviously, too tall to swim in its shallow waters. Totally unaware of the monstrosity on the other side.\n\nI know it’s horrible, but I could tell them about the game me and Bella use to play. Because maybe, just maybe if It gets young blood after so long, things will get better.\n\nI know it’s awful, and that I’m a horrible person.\n\nI’d never felt attached to this place before, not really. Not until It bit me and my eyes were opened. It is an ancient, awful being, I know that. But the future is uncertain and I’m scared. I’m scared, not because of the beast beneath the waves, but of loss. My community shrinks every day, and people like this would never be accepted here anyways. And besides, those people aren’t good parents. They have so many kids, I’m sure they wouldn’t notice or care if just one went away. If you knew how special my home was, you’d probably do the same. Or maybe that’s just It influencing me from afar.\n\nIsabella and grandma would be so disappointed but I don’t think they’d get it. We could restore our little oasis to what it once was, or even better, back to the way the old folks talk about how it was. With green, fertile pastures and opportunity and a thriving, bottomless river so deep that the danger within is long, long forgotten. Out of sight.\n\nAt least for a few decades.\n\nI’m a horrible person, but I know what I need to do. I’m sorry, Bella, but sometimes evil is a necessity for survival. I miss you so goddamn much but even your sacrifice wasn’t in vain. Our God has called me to worship and I know nothing else anymore.\n\nI just hope you can understand.",

And whenever I could make it out to Port Rowan, I’d be right out there with him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI gotta be honest, half of the time we were out on that boat we were just sharing a few beers and talking idly about whatever crossed our minds. Life, kids, marriage, work. It wasn’t so much about catching fish as it was about just sort of taking a few hours to relax out on the water and forget about our troubles. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI’m of the mind that a person needs an escape like that every so often. It’s good for the soul. When life got rough, when my wife cheated on me a few years back, when Dan lost his son, whenever either of us just needed a friend to talk to for a while, those fishing trips were a Godsend. We could leave our problems at the marina and forget about them for a few hours. It was heaven.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen Danny had asked me if I was free for a fishing trip that Friday, I couldn’t have said yes fast enough. I didn’t have the kids that weekend and was looking forward to spending my days on the water as opposed to bumming around the house, watching my day slip through my fingertips as I tried to stay busy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe met up by the marina and shot the shit for a little bit as we loaded our fishing gear into the boat. Tackle, bait, cooler, and whatnot. Then with everything all good to go, I kicked back and let Danny take us out onto the open water, cracking open my first beer as he took us to one of our usual spots a short distance down along the shore. It was this nice little lagoon out near Long Point. Nothing all that special, but it was quiet and nobody else really bothered us there. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDanny stopped the boat, dropped anchor, and got himself a beer as we started to set ourselves up. He’d caught us some live grasshoppers to use as bait. We always did pretty well with those. They were a little harder to get on the hook, but the fish went crazy for them! Ten minutes after we’d made it to the lagoon, we had our lines in the water and were sitting pretty, enjoying the peaceful solitude and pleasant company. Life really couldn’t have gotten any better than that. Beers in hand, we waited for a bite and gossipped like a couple of old ladies on bingo night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “You hear about Brad?” He’d asked me.\n\n  “What’s going on with Brad?”\n\n  “Stupid bastard got served his divorce papers last week.”\n\n  “Aw hell… Don’t tell me. His wife finally figured out where his paycheque’s going?”\n\n  “Yup. Although take a wild guess how.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI took a swig of my beer.\n\n  “Credit card statements?” I asked hopelessly.\n\n  “Nope. Poor girl got herself a case of brothel sprouts… From Brad.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI paused, raising an eyebrow.\n\n  “He didn’t…”\n\n  “He did…” Danny said, letting out a sigh that was half exasperation and half incredulity.\n\n  “You’re shitting me?” \n\n  “Nope.”\n\n  “Wow…” I just shook my head and sighed in disbelief, “That dumb fuck deserves whatever he gets at this point.”\n\n  “Yup.”\n\n  “I mean, she treated him so good! And he treated her like that? Y’know what I would’ve given to have married a woman like that?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “Yup…” Danny sighed and shook his head, “I really can’t pity the bastard. I knew he was going behind her back and I told him God only knows how many times to cut that shit out. I told him, that kinda thing always catches up to you.”\n\n  “It does,” I said, nodding slowly. \n\n  “He didn’t listen.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomething tugged on Danny’s line and he paused, waiting for a moment to confirm he had a bite before yanking up his line. I paused, watching him as he reeled in our first catch of the day. The fish came struggling out of the water, flipping violently back and forth as he pulled it out before dangling limply at the end of the line.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “Well, well, lookit you…” Danny said, admiring it for a few moments. It was nothing more than a simple rock bass, and a small one at that. Even if we weren’t just planning on releasing what we caught, we would’ve thrown it back anyways. We almost always threw back whatever we caught, although we’d broken that rule from time to time if we caught something worth taking home for dinner, not that we usually did. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDanny gently took the fish off the hook and set it back into the water, watching as it darted back below the murky depths. \n\n  “See you around, little buddy.” He’d said, before sitting back down, taking a sip of his beer, and putting some fresh bait on his line.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe late morning and early afternoon drifted by in a pleasant, lazy haze as Danny and I hopped from topic to topic. The trees hanging over the lagoon gave us shade. I went through enough beers to get a little tipsy, although since Danny still had to drive the boat, he limited himself to two and he made them last. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe caught a few more fish throughout the day. Mostly more rock bass, although we’d also hooked a couple of crappies just to mix things up. \n\n  “You up for another beer?” I’d asked Danny, taking a fresh one out of the cooler.\n\n  “Nah, you go right ahead.” He’d said, before slipping his phone out of his pocket to check the time. I saw him pause to respond to a text from his wife, a small smile crossing his face as he did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “You got any dinner plans?” He asked, “Cathy’s doing chicken parmesan.”\n\n  “Hey, count me in.” I said, “She’s a better cook than I am.”\n\n  “Don’t I know it.” He teased, before there was another slight tug on his line. His smile had widened as he’d waited for whatever was on the other end to take a bite. He got another nibble, then another before feeling a much stronger pull and jerking his rod upwards. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “Shit, I think this is a biggun…” He said, and judging by the fight whatever was on the other end of his line was putting up, I had a feeling he was right. We usually didn’t find anything that impressive in this little lagoon, but maybe this was the exception?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDanny kept a white knuckled grip on his fishing rod, trying to reel in whatever was on the other end of it. With the way he was fighting, I almost began to wonder if what he’d actually got was a pile of stubborn weeds, but weeds didn’t usually fight like that… There was clearly something pulling at his rod. It couldn’t just be weeds, could it? Danny cranked his line up further, and the water beneath us grew cloudy with mud. I took a final sip of my beer and watched as he fought with whatever was in the water. \n\n  “It’s coming…” He said, “It’s coming…”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI stared down over the edge of the boat, and I could’ve sworn I saw something moving down there. I thought it was just the weeds at first… But I couldn’t be entirely sure. Maybe it was a fish? But if so, I’ve never seen a fish like that before. It was easily bigger than anything else we’d ever caught!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “C’mon you bastard…” Danny growled, biting his lip as he tried to pull whatever was down there up onto the boat. Something caused the surface of the water to swell and I felt the boat rock violently beneath us. Danny paused for a moment, letting up some slack on his line, a look of utter confusion crossing his face.\n\n  “Was that the fish?” He asked.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhatever was under the water hit the boat again, even harder this time. It rocked hard enough to knock me off my feet and I saw Danny brace himself against the railing as his fishing rod fell into the water with a splash. He stared down into the water with big wide eyes, and I saw his expression slowly go from confusion to shock as he seemed to see something beneath the surface of the water.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI heard him open his mouth as he started to scream before the boat was hit again, rocking violently again and this time, it finally capsized. Danny and I were both spilled into the water as the boat flipped. I plunged beneath the surface, kicking my legs to make it back up again. As I got my head back above water, I spotted the rocky shore of the lagoon nearby and swam for it, thinking only that I needed to get the hell out of the water as soon as possible. From the corner of my eye, I saw Danny doing the same thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe was right behind me… I swear to God he was right behind me…\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen, I heard a scream. It was brief… I almost thought that maybe he was calling my name, but if he was, he never got the chance to finish. When I looked back, Danny was gone and his boat was upside down behind me. The muddy water still swirled around me, and I only hesitated for a moment before swimming frantically to shore, not even slowing down when I felt my feet touch the bottom, allowing me to trudge up into the shallows. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “Danny?” I called, looking back again and hoping I’d see him swimming towards me. But as far as I could tell, I was alone out there.\n\n  “DANNY?” I called again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo answer. No Danny. Just an unsettling silence, and the sight of his capsized boat about twenty feet away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe police looked, but they didn’t find any trace of Danny out in that lagoon, or anywhere in Lake Erie for that matter. They also didn’t find any trace of the thing that capsized the boat. Hell, they had the fucking gall to tell me that we’d probably just hit a rock or something. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBullshit. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know what happened out there. There was no rock. The boat wasn’t even moving. Danny hooked something in the water, and it knocked the boat over. I think it got him when he tried to swim away… Dragged him screaming under the water and… I don’t know… Saying ‘*it ate him*’ sounds… God, it sounds too horrible to be true, but what other explanation is there? They never found a body, and I’ve got a feeling that Danny isn’t just going to turn up alive and well somewhere… Either way, he’s gone and I don’t have any answers. I only know what I saw and truth be told it wasn’t much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I were a bolder man, I’d say something to the effect of: ‘*I’m going back out there and I’m gonna find that thing that killed my friend!*.’ But that kind of bravado just isn’t in me. Even if I knew where or how to find it, I’ve got no idea how I’d kill it. So instead, I’m doing what I can do. I’ve been staying on land, ideally away from wherever that thing can get me, I’ve been keeping Danny’s widow company, helping her get over his loss and I’m sharing this. I’m not sure just how much good it’ll do… But if it helps someone, then maybe I’ll sleep just a little bit [easier.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadOfSpectre/)",

        "text": "I work as a volunteer in a wolf sanctuary up in the Pacific Northwest. It’s a fairly small establishment, and a fairly young one too. We started during the 2010s and we kept going as a small but determined group of people. We take things seriously, and we live by our desire to help these majestic beasts.\n\nThe sanctuary stands on a pretty remote spot, completely surrounded by forest. We like the thought of keeping our animals as close as possible to their habitat, and this position also lets us keep track fairly easily of the wolves we set free after the rescue. It isn’t an easy life by any means, but we’ve managed to adjust to it, some more than others. For me, these forests really feel like home, and once we got our cabin up and running with electricity and internet I stopped caring about my life in the nearby town. I had all I wanted right there, among the trees. \n\nHowever, for the sake of everyone’s mental well being, we take turns to stay in here. No more than two weeks, no less than two people. The woods can really strain your mind, and that’s not optimal when your daily routine revolves around caring for wild animals that can easily weigh more than 100 pounds and could potentially tear you to shreds in mere seconds. \n\nThis time, it was me and Oliver’s turn. It was a pretty chill time: Oliver is amazing at his job, the weather was nice despite the low temperatures and our residents were absolutely lovely. By residents, I mean four wonderful specimens of Northwestern gray wolves, rescued as pups and raised by us in captivity. Four wonderful females: Artemis, Tia, Ice and Dawn. They are a considerable amount of work, but it’s really worth it. \n\nSo as I was saying, things were going pretty smooth. Then, yesterday morning, one of the GPS devices we use to track rescued wolves sent out a signal. Nothing really out of the ordinary: this signal in particular lets us know that the device has not moved at all in the last 24 hours. It could mean that the animal is hurt, but most times it simply means that the device has somehow detached from the collar of the wolf and needs to be recovered. So Oliver decided to go and check it out. The day went on as usual, until early afternoon. Oliver contacted me via radio, stating that he was rushing back to camp. I could hear his voice being a little different, less composed and calm than usual. About 20 mins later, he rolled in to the front of the sanctuary with our pick up.\n\n“Man you gotta take a look at this” he said, getting off the vehicle in a hurry. As I approached the back of the pick up where Oliver was standing, I could immediately feel the pungent smell of rotting flesh. Oliver said nothing, he just stared down, eventually covering his nose. On the back of the pick up laid the corpse of a wolf we rescued months back. HIs beautiful black fur ruffled, his eyes and mouth wide open and three huge slashes on the side of his body. *Those are way too big,* I remember thinking instinctively. We tried to assess the situation with Oliver back in the hut. He decided to drive back to town before sundown, so he could get the carcass to the local vet in the hope of getting some answers. He proposed to ask someone to come over and cover him for the night, but I assured him I would be just fine. He left shortly after, leaving me alone with the wolves, who were wandering around their enclosure, probably alerted by the strong smell of death still faintly present in the air.\n\nI finished my tasks for the day, prepared some canned soup for dinner and ate it straight out of the can, while trying to wrap my head around the wounds on that wolf. I had never seen anything like it, and a quick check in the sanctuary’s archive revealed that something like that had just never happened before. It was common to find dead wolves, but it was way less common to find massacred ones. Just as I was skimming through all our reports, I realized that one of the wolves was loudly growling outside. A weird behavior for sure. I looked out the window: it was Artemis, on the far side of the pen, right at the fence, growling at the dark tree line just ahead. I found it extremely weird for her to do such a thing. I grabbed my flashlight and headed outside. I could see my breath, and I realized that the evening air had gotten slightly colder than usual. I made my way to the fence, opened the gate and squeezed myself in. Tia, Ice and Dawn came out of their enclosures and quickly made their way around me. Now this wasn’t unusual per se, but the way they kept their posture low was. They were clearly alarmed by something. I called for Artemis, to no avail. She just kept on growling at seemingly nothing. In the air, the same rotting smell was still present, if not even stronger than before. This couldn’t have been possible. The whole situation gave me a gut feeling like no other. I couldn’t put my finger on it, but I was feeling exposed. Part of me wanted to get the wolves and crawl back in the hut with them, clearly not the brightest train of thought. I slowly made my way to Artemis. When I placed my hand on her back she stopped growling and started softly whimpering to me, briefly looking at me, before staring back in the dark. She seemed relieved.\n\nI flashed my light in the dark. Nothing but trees, no movement, anything at all. The wolves didn’t cut back on their alerted state though. They were still scared by *something*. I started taking them back the the enclosures and locking them in. As I was closing Tia’s door, Dawn started growling too, immediately followed by Ice, from inside her enclosure. My unease started to spiral out of control, so I hurried the whole process. Once the doors were locked, I started walking back to the hut. But then I realized how silent the whole place had become. Dead silence, all around. Then, a faint shuffling, some twigs breaking. My heart sank: it came right from where Artemis was growling at. I stood there, like a deer in the headlight, pondering my options. I decided to check once again, just to be sure, before going back to the hut as fast as possible, closing the door, closing all the shutters and just trying to get some sleep. I walked slowly, flashlight in my right hand, pointing the beam left and right. \n\nThen I saw them. \n\nTwo eyes in the darkness, shining back at me. Two amber dots, about a foot from the ground. The eyes of a wolf?! As I kept on staring at them, wondering what was going on, something impossible happened: without breaking eye contact, the dots started lifting up, and up, and up. When they stopped, they stood among the pine needles, about 10 foot high, before vanishing. I kept hearing twigs breaking, before silence fell back around me.\n\nThat was it. I darted back to the hut, closing every damn shutter and bolting the doors. I stood there in complete darkness, and in complete silence, hardly getting any sleep at all.\n\nAs I write this the sun is way up in the sky, but I still can’t shake off the dreadful feeling those eyes casted upon me. The wolves seem to be fine, and Oliver should be returning later today. \n\nThis forest felt like my home. Today I don’t feel so sure about that any more.",

        "text": " In my early twenties, I was chilling at my best friend's house one evening when we decided to go on a sunset walk along her street. It was a muggy summer afternoon, not too humid, it was just the right amount for New England. \n\nAs we made our way down Bedford St the sun was setting, we decided to walk on the bike path that connects to a side street that could loop us back around to her house. After passing the mouth of the bike path entrance the sun began to set, filling the sky with a velvety layer of darkness. We turned off our flashlights to do a quick sesh, but in the middle of it a biker with a headlight light on came barreling down the path. Taken off guard we both jumped. I quickly threw the device back into my pocket, as my friend suddenly turned her phone flashlight off to cloak us in darkness. After he passed we paused for a moment before bursting out into laughter, then continued on our way.\n\n Then after walking a few paces, we heard a weird set of shrieks coming from the surrounding woods. We were deep within the wooded bike path now, with nowhere to where run but one direction, out. I tried to keep my calm, as we sped up our pace but the screams grew stranger. It sounded like an injured bird of prey or a distorted version of a fox's blood-curdling childlike cry. As the screams intensified we began to run, and both of us are fast as a whip luckily. As we rounded the corner before the mouth of the bike path meets a real street, we stopped out of breath. \"What the hell was that?\" my friend bellowed out. \"I don't f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* know, maybe a hurt animal?\" but we both knew something more sinister was probably going on in those woods. \"Let's head home and chill out\", I said as we made out way back to Bedford street, in the darkness, with the street lights as our only friends. That wasn't the creepy part of the story, the next part is...\n\nThis is where the story gets blurry, probably from a bit of trauma. The hooded man slowed down his pace, watching us as he continued walking on the other side of the street. I kept my eyes on him, as my friend began freaking out about the whole situation. Remembering what I was taught, I looked behind me and saw another hooded man bellowing toward us. Confused in pure terror for a moment, I looked across the street to find the first man chasing us, he was still there. Where did this second man come from? Was he hiding behind one of the trees that line the front of the Public Waste building?\n\n We sped up, unsure of where to go and nervous, as we were about the approach the mouth of the bike path again. I could feel the adrenalin surging through every particle of my body. I turned again to check our surroundings, and this time both men were right behind us. I don't know how the first guy teleported across the street without both of us noticing but somehow he did. Staring up at the blank and empty hooded faces, I felt an unrivaled sense of absolute fear. \"RUN\" I screamed to my friend as I booked it into the middle of the street, the safest place I thought. In my frenzy to escape to the middle of the road, I didn't realize my friend was still on the sidewalk, frozen in fear, staring up into the 'faces' of both hoodied creatures. \"Run, A please RUN!\" I bellowed, but she was stuck, unable to move from the terror that she face. I sped over to her, grappled her shirt until I clasped her arm, and pulled her back with me into the street. It took a moment for her to move, but she eventually broke from the paralyzed trance she was in.\n\nAs we ran down the middle of the street, I led us toward the warm neon lights of the closed pizza joint. Feeling that was the safest place for us, in public with plenty of light. I looked toward the area we had just run from, trying to scope out these creeps. They had both gone back to their respective sidewalks and were walking in unison until they both reached the two mouths of the bike bath that cut across Bedford street. In absolute shock we watched them both stop at the opposing path entrances, facing the darkness of the path. \"Call your dad for a ride now, \" I said quickly, \"I don't feel safe walking past them or by the bike path again\". \n\nAfter hanging up we looked back to see both men had disappeared, we assume they walked back onto the bike path but can't be sure. Her dad showed up in his old green Ford pickup, pissed as hell that we had been terrorized and stalked. \"They went down here?!\" he exclaimed, pointing to the bike path, \"yes\" we both responded. He quickly drove his car into the mouth of one of the paths, turning on his high beams to expose them but nothing was there.\n\nI am not sure if these hooded figures were human stalkers, human traffickers who sucked at their jobs, unusual Satanists, or supernatural. My hometown is 30-40 min away from Salem MA, there have been countless rumors about Satanists doing rituals in the woods along the bike path. I know a few Satanists myself that would never pull this crap, they are actually awesome people. The fact that I couldn't make out a face for either figure is what scares me the most. If anyone has any ideas or thoughts on what these figures could have been, please comment. This is only one of the many creepy situations that I have encountered with my friend 'A', we seem to be a magnet for the strange and bizarre. I have a few personal experiences with the supernatural as well, so I may share more accounts if anyone is interested.\n\n\\- JW",

That wasn't the creepy part of the story, the next part is...\n\nWe had just passed our favorite pizza joint when I noticed a man in all black walking behind us. I was always taught growing up to look out for my surroundings, don't wear headphones when walking alone, and always look behind me. \"There's someone behind us\" I whispered to my friend, turning again to gauge his distance and demeanor. 'He' was about 15 feet back, wearing a black hoodie, with the hood up, and black pants, in one hand was a plastic bag from the grocery store barely filled, and in the other was a long wooden staff (this concerned me). We picked up our pace, as we made our way past the pizza joint and closer (30-45 ft) to the first entrance to the bike path that we had taken before. The street lights in this section are sparse, and we were in a patch of darkness when I turned around again to see where this staff-wielding man was. HE WAS RIGHT BEHIND US, less than a foot and staring directly into our souls, well I assume he was because I couldn't make out a FACE, it was all darkness. I screamed and so did my friend, in shock. We bolted across the road to the other side of the street.  This is where the story gets blurry, probably from a bit of trauma.

Confused in pure terror for a moment, I looked across the street to find the first man chasing us, he was still there. Where did this second man come from? Was he hiding behind one of the trees that line the front of the Public Waste building? We sped up, unsure of where to go and nervous, as we were about the approach the mouth of the bike path again. I could feel the adrenalin surging through every particle of my body.  I turned again to check our surroundings, and this time both men were right behind us. I don't know how the first guy teleported across the street without both of us noticing but somehow he did. Staring up at the blank and empty hooded faces, I felt an unrivaled sense of absolute fear.  \"RUN\" I screamed to my friend as I booked it into the middle of the street, the safest place I thought. In my frenzy to escape to the middle of the road, I didn't realize my friend was still on the sidewalk, frozen in fear, staring up into the 'faces' of both hoodied creatures. \"Run, A please RUN!\" I bellowed, but she was stuck, unable to move from the terror that she face. I sped over to her, grappled her shirt until I clasped her arm, and pulled her back with me into the street. It took a moment for her to move, but she eventually broke from the paralyzed trance she was in. \n\n As we ran down the middle of the street, I led us toward the warm neon lights of the closed pizza joint. Feeling that was the safest place for us, in public with plenty of light. I looked toward the area we had just run from, trying to scope out these creeps. They had both gone back to their respective sidewalks and were walking in unison until they both reached the two mouths of the bike bath that cut across Bedford street. In absolute shock we watched them both stop at the opposing path entrances, facing the darkness of the path. \"Call your dad for a ride now, \" I said quickly, \"I don't feel safe walking past them or by the bike path again\". After hanging up we looked back to see both men had disappeared, we assume they walked back onto the bike path but can't be sure. Her dad showed up in his old green Ford pickup, pissed as hell that we had been terrorized and stalked. \"They went down here?!\" he exclaimed, pointing to the bike path, \"yes\" we both responded. He quickly drove his car into the mouth of one of the paths, turning on his high beams to expose them but nothing was there. \n\nI am not sure if these hooded figures were human stalkers, human traffickers who sucked at their jobs, unusual Satanists, or supernatural. My hometown is 30-40 min away from Salem MA, there have been countless rumors about Satanists doing rituals in the woods along the bike path.  I know a few Satanists myself that would never pull this crap, they are actually awesome people. The fact that I couldn't make out a face for either figure is what scares me the most. If anyone has any ideas or thoughts on what these figures could have been, please comment. This is only one of the many creepy situations that I have encountered with my friend 'A', we seem to be a magnet for the strange and bizarre. I have a few personal experiences with the supernatural as well, so I may share more accounts if anyone is interested. \n\n\\- WJ",

        "text": "I live in a ranch house in Idaho. I rent this house from my landlord, who we'll call Frank. Frank is a very strange man. He talks so little that I've only heard a few dozen words from him. About a month ago, he popped in and said that he needed to do a checkup on my crawlspace. He does stuff like this quite a bit. It's to the point where it kind of bugs me. I let him go into my crawlspace and he was in there for a while.\n\nAfter a couple of hours had passed, I texted him and asked if he had found anything of note down there. I received a reply that read, \"Wdym?\" I repeated what I had just told him. He then sent me a message that chilled me to my core. He said, \"I'm not in your crawlspace.\" I started losing my mind. I was thinking, \"If the man in my crawlspace isn't Frank, who is he?\" I immediately locked the trapdoor that leads to my crawlspace and put the heaviest object I could find on it.\n\nI yelled at whatever was in my crawlspace, \"What are you?\" He replied in a weirded-out tone, \"I'm Frank, your landlord.\" I said, \"No you're not. What are you?\" I could hear him try to open the trapdoor to no avail. He screamed at me, \"What're you talking about? Let me out!\" I said in a shaky voice, \"The real Frank texted me. You're a liar.\" He started banging on the trapdoor like a maniac as he frantically said, \"What real Frank? I am Frank! Let me out! Please! I'm the real Frank! You have to believe me.\" I didn't believe him.\n\nI questioned him for a few hours. He denied all of the accusations that I threw at him. At a certain point, I was almost convinced that he was the real Frank. I texted the real Frank again for confirmation that the one in my crawlspace was fake, but he didn't answer. I thought that this was a bit strange, but I brushed it off as it was late. After probably ten hours, the thing stopped answering my questions. I tried screaming at it, but it wouldn't say a word. I went to bed but I couldn't sleep. I was thinking about what would happen if it escaped the crawlspace.\n\nWhen the morning came, I went to question the fake Frank again. He still wouldn't answer. About a month later, I decided that I was brave enough to check what had happened to the imposter. I unlocked the trapdoor to the crawlspace and opened it. What I found nauseated me. It was the decomposing body of Frank. I stumbled back and called the police. When they came, I told them everything. I was going to show them the texts that Frank had sent me, but they were gone. It said that Frank's number had never existed. This had me hyperventilating. Who had texted me? Was it a prank? Could it have possibly been some sort of a creature? I don't know. The cops blamed me for Frank's murder and I'm going to court tomorrow. Wish me luck.",

        "text": "The boy next door is no longer an enigma.\n\nNo longer a mystery.\n\nFor the last few days, I have been laying low after Mrs Wilder kidnapped and threatened me in my own home. I’ve had barely any sleep and my lack of it has definitely disrupted my ability to write. I’m sorry if this update is messy or full of typos. I just don’t know what to do. \n\nI’ve been a mess. I’ve been jumping at every movement. Every time there’s a knock on the door I feel part of myself splinter into pieces I can’t put back together. I did something crazy stupid two days ago. And that stupid mistake has fully exposed me to Mrs Wilder’s secret. What she is hiding behind her walls—and just how fucked I truly am if I disobey her again. Like I said, over the last several days I have been keeping my head down.\n\nI went to school and did my homework and went to bed. That was it. When mom asked if I was talking to any Wilder kids, I shook my head. I had quickly grown afraid of Casper Wilder’s window. I knew something was wrong with him.\n\nSomething wrong with his head. \n\nHe had told me. At least, the part of him which was bleeding between consciousness and a submissive state not being controlled by his psychotic mother. I saw him. I saw who he really was. I saw the boy next door crying out to me for help through bloodied fingers and cryptic messages splattered in scarlet. If he had intentionally hurt himself to get messages across to me, there was something he was fighting.\n\nMrs Wilder’s words were haunting me. The paper-doll rendition of me, blackened and smouldering orange between her nimble fingers-- I couldn’t get it out of my head. \n\nSo, I grabbed all the paper I could find and taped up my window, blocking him out. It sounds ridiculous. And it was. Because once I had spent over an hour feverishly taping pieces of paper over my window, I tore them down with a knot in my gut. When I clawed away the last piece of paper, I got a glimpse of Casper. His curtains were open, allowing me to see inside his room once more.\n\nI saw a normal guy’s bedroom once again, guitars leaning against the walls, clothes strewn over the floor and sketchpads littering the bed. Warm light illuminated the window, and I wished what I was seeing was normal. \n\nI wished I  had seen nothing bad, and this was just the boy next door. \n\nMy completely normal neighbor. \n\nBut I couldn’t deny what I’d seen two nights ago. Casper Wilder wasn’t standing at his window with a twisted expression, a cocktail of pain and anger and confusion burning in mismatched eyes I was sure glinted with something metallic. Something man-made—which had been inserted, no, forced inside him.\n\nI expected him to be awake.  Even if it was just a single look in his eye which told me he was still there—still holding on. No. It was like nothing had ever happened. The window had been cleaned of blood, and there were no traces of the boy who had cried out for help. In his place was the Wilder son I had found friendship with. Before he cracked, and something inside him, something buried deep, deep, down, ignited. I missed that version of him. Who he used to be. \n\nBecause this guy was not Casper Wilder. I didn’t know who he was—and neither did he from the way he’d reacted days before. Underneath this name being forced onto him, there was nothing. \n\nJust a broken kid with no name. No memory, except ones filled with her. I missed the personality Mrs Wilder was trying to hide. Who had told me she wasn’t his fucking mother, and sworn at me, his writing erratic and confusing, clawing into his head with this desperation to be let go. \n\nSeeing him through the window at that moment, I realised, a sickly paste crawling up my throat, that all of that had been erased. He had returned to default. Casper was sitting on his bed playing guitar with a look of content, bed hair falling in sleepy eyes. He was wearing his glasses this time. His fingers moved up and down, feet bouncing to a beat I couldn’t hear.\n\nStumbling back, I tripped over my backpack with a shriek, which caught Casper’s attention.\n\nWhen his head twisted around, empty eyes floating towards the window, I ducked. I couldn’t stop myself. After counting to ten, I slowly lifted my gaze. \n\nHe was still staring at me, and I noticed he’d stopped playing the guitar, fingers entangled in the strings. Casper’s smile had dimmed slightly. I wondered if seeing me brought something back. Maybe he remembered writing his own bloody messages on the window and trying and failing to speak through his mother’s control. The boy blinked at me before slowly getting to his feet. I didn’t see the chord thing this time. Casper strode over to the window, a giddy smile curling on the edges of his lips.\n\nHe pressed his palm against the glass, and I was already grabbing my notepad and a pen. But then his mother’s words sliced through my thoughts. I was back inside my lounge, foggy headed, the stink of pool cleaner still thick at the back of my nose and throat. \n\nMrs Wilder loomed over me, my paper-doll she had ravaged sticking from the doll-house on mom’s coffee table constructed from our letters. “I hope you understand that if you talk to, or even breathe the same air as my children again, I will rip you apart too.” \n\nHer breath was heavy in my face. I couldn’t help looking at Mrs Becker for help, but her eyes were equally as cruel. I watched perfectly manicured nails pick up one of the four Wilder dolls, making it dance around in circles.\n\n “Do you understand me, Phoebe?”\n\n“Yes.” I said, my words twisted on my tongue. \n\n“I… I understand.”\n\nThe memory was painful enough to feel physical knives digging into my gut. Mrs Wilder had made it clear that if I pursued her children, she was going to hurt me. Mom, too. I dropped my notepad and pen. Casper was still smiling at me. His eyes were vacant. He had no idea who I was after months of us talking. Mrs Wilder had taken all of it away. Including him breaking apart and waking up as a confused shell with no name. “Hello.” Casper’s lips mouthed the words, and I took several steps back, my heart in my throat. \n\nHe didn’t even blink. I watched his expression fail to flicker and wondered just how the fuck had I never noticed there was something wrong with him in the months I knew him. I watched him search his desk for a notepad and pen. Maybe seeing me was unravelling something inside him, I thought. Maybe I could try and wake him up again. At the back of my mind, however, I could still see my little paper doll’s head being torn off, its body ripped apart.\n\n“What’s your name?” Casper had written in bubble writing. It’s like everything had been reset. His frenzied and wild eyes, that desperation to escape. Gone. \n\nHis handwriting was boiling my blood. Just looking at this perfect calligraphy which wasn’t even his. It had been forced onto him. Because Mrs Wilder expected this boy to be the perfect son, a creative prodigy like his siblings. I looked for a splinter in his eyes, just a glimpse that he was still in there. Still fighting whatever his ‘mother’ had done to him. But I saw nothing. I saw a blank fucking slate.\n\n“Phoebe.” I mouthed.\n\nInclining his head, he scribbled a follow up message. “Can you write it down?”\n\nSwallowing a lump in my throat, I shut my curtains, blocking him and his message out. Then I jumped into bed, turned off my light, and dreamed I was that paper-doll with no mouth to scream with, as Mrs Wilder slowly tore me limb from limb. The next day felt like a blur. I don’t think I snapped out of it until mom poked me with the prongs of her fork, tearing me from a scenario I was going over in my head. \n\nIf Casper was a prisoner, were his siblings too? I’d only caught a glimpse of Issac and Freddie Wilder. Mrs Wilder talked of being pregnant with four children. But she spoke like she had lost them. So, my guess was that she had kidnapped four teenager’s in their place—and was raising them as her dead children. “Are you okay, honey?” \n\nMom’s voice slid through my thoughts, and I realised I had been pushing my pasta around my plate. I wasn’t really hungry. \n\nMom had made this sort of red pepper spaghetti, but every time I tried to take a mouthful, I was seeing spatters of scarlet running from Casper’s temples, dripping down his face and smudged on the glass of his window. THUD. The image of him slamming his head into the pane, wild eyes and twisted lips, an agonising panic bringing him to the edge of hysteria caught me off guard, and my fork slipped through my fingers, tomato sauce slowly creeping its way back up my throat.\n\nFuck. I couldn’t forget about him. I couldn’t leave him and block him out after his mother had threatened me. Because if I didn’t help him, who would? It was my word against the town.\n\nMom cleared her throat\n\n“Phoebe, are you listening to me?”\n\n“Huh?”\n\n“I said, have you been abiding by the rules?” Mom twirled pasta around her fork and took a dainty bite. Since joining Mrs Becker’s book club I  had noticed a certain gleam in her eye. Like she was looking through me. “You haven’t been talking to the Wilder children, have you?”\n\n“No.”\n\nAfter three mouthfuls of spaghetti, I ended up with half of my dinner dripping down my face.\n\nMom grabbed a napkin, handing it to me. “Clean yourself up. You are seventeen, not seven.” Her expression softened. “Sweetie, are you okay?”\n\n “Yes.” I said, struggling to appear it. I knew she could see my sleep circles.\n\n“Have you been talking to the Wilder kids? I’ll know if you have.”\n\nTechnically, I had been communicating with him. But it was one-sided.\n\nStill though, paranoia turned my thoughts against me. Shovelling down spaghetti, I spoke through a mouthful. “No.”\n\nShe handed me another napkin. “So, if I talk to Mrs Wilder…”\n\n“Mom.” I grabbed her hand, squeezing it for dear life. Mrs Wilder knew, I thought dizzily. She must have known Casper’s attempt to talk to me, even if he was exactly who she wanted him to be. Still under her demented control. But it was confusing me just how she had that control. This wasn’t a movie or a TV show. \n\nMind control didn’t exist, right? And if it did, it was barely even a thing—induced by cocktails of drugs and torture. Casper didn’t look like he’d been tortured. \n\nExcept that thing inside his head… my thoughts grew foggy, and I was suddenly overcome with emotion. What I meant to tell her was all about what I had seen, and what Mrs Wilder had done to me. Though knowing what the woman was capable of, and thinking about that chord-like thing which surely had been forced into the back of Casper Wilder’s skull… “Can we just…move?” I choked out. “I want to move. I hate it here.” I gestured around.\n\n“I hate this house. It’s too big, I feel like I’m lost every time I go upstairs. I hate school. The kids there freak me out.” Holding her gaze, I curled my lip. “And I hate our stupid neighbors.”\n\n“Phoebe.” Mom’s tone darkened. “What did I tell you about being respectful?”\n\n“It’s not like they can hear us!” I spat. “Did they fit cameras in here, mom? I wouldn’t be surprised! We’re under draconian rules!”\n\n“Young lady, you are acting like a child.” She said stiffly. “Take several deep breaths and tell me what is wrong.”\n\n“I’m fine.” I whispered.\n\n“No, you are not.” Mom sipped red wine. “I know when there is something wrong with my daughter, and you cannot look me in the eye.”\n\nI took a sharp breath and forced myself to stay calm. “Mom.” I sputtered through a sob. “It’s Mrs Wilder. She… she did something to me.”\n\nMom’s expression twisted. “What?”\n\n“The other night,” I forced out. The images were flooding my head. Smouldering orange tearing its way through paper white. “She knocked me out, and she had this… dollhouse. And four paper dolls.” \n\nI heaved out a breath. “She threatened me, mom. Mrs Wilder threatened me, and I need you to believe me.” I grabbed for her hand again, my own trembling. “Casper Wilder is not her son.” I said. The words felt foreign on my tongue. Wrong. They felt like a time bomb. “I think she kidnapped him. All of them. And she’s brainwashed them into thinking they’re her real kids.” There was a pause, and my mom’s expression didn’t change. So, I continued. “We need to call the police.” I reiterated.  “Okay? You’re listening to me, aren’t you?” I swallowed sobs wracking my chest. “Because… you’re my mom. And you’re supposed to believe me.”\n\nShe surprised me with an eye-roll. “You are being ridiculous.”\n\nTHUD.\n\nIt felt like the walls were suddenly closing in. I could smell the stink of pool cleaner and Mrs Wilder’s perfume intoxicating my senses.\n\nTHUD.\n\nI was seeing Casper slamming his head into his window once again, his eyes alive with a light I couldn’t understand. Like something was entwined inside his pupil.\n\nTHUD.\n\n“Help me.”\n\nGod, it wouldn’t stop.\n\nHis voice. It was driving me crazy.\n\n“I don’t know who I am.” Casper’s sobs echoed. “I don’t… I don’t fucking know who I am! I can’t remember… I can’t remember who I am!”\n\nI could see his words clear in my mind, red scrawled against white until they were barely readable.\n\nWHO.\n\nAM.\n\nI?\n\nWHO AM I? WHO AM I? WHO AM I? I DON’T KNOW WHO I AM. THAT WOMAN IS NOT MY MOM.\n\nI was going to be sick.\n\n“Mom,” The words were choking from my mouth before I could stop them. I didn’t mean to sound so childlike, but that is exactly what I felt like. A child. I was alone. Drowning. \n\nLooking at my mother’s curled lips, her eyes burning right through me, I felt myself start to come apart.\n\nLike that stupid doll.  \n\n“Mom, please—”\n\nShe cut me off with a snort. “What? Is this because you're not allowed to talk to the boy next door? You’re creating your own narrative, and it’s… endearing. Childlike, but you are a child after all.\" Mom chuckled. “Sweetie, I know you love your mysteries, and sure, I can understand the cliché Romeo and Juliet thing going on, but really, there are plenty more fish in the sea. You don’t have to make up ridiculous scenarios.”\n\nI let go of her hand, my toes curling. They didn’t sound like her words. They were someone else’s.\n\nWhat was she talking about, ridiculous scenarios? Did my mother really think I was capable of imagining all of this shit?\n\nI couldn’t reply. Not when part of me wondered if these were even her words. I had a strong suspicion my mom was just a puppet.\n\nLike someone was talking through her.\n\n“Do you like him?” Mom pressed. In her eyes, I could see Mrs Wilder was asking that question. “Is that why you’re being so… “ She trailed off with a sigh, and I glimpsed her fingers tighten around her wine glass, pressing enough pressure to leave marks on the rim. “Difficult?”\n\nMom’s lips splintered into a grin which wasn’t hers, and something inside me snapped. She was joking around.\n\nWhen Casper was suffering, a prisoner of his own mind, my mother was treating me like I was fucking love-sick.\n\n\"No!\" I shook my head. “No, I want to move.” I whispered. “I want to go back to our old house.”\n\n“That’s not going to happen, sweetie. You know I can’t just leave my job. Phoebe, you’re a senior at school. You have SAT’S.”\n\n“But—\"\n\nHer expression softened. “You’ll grow to like it. Don’t worry.” She said, before standing up and carrying our plates to the faucet. “I have a late shift tonight, so I expect your best behaviour.” I barely felt mom press a kiss to my forehead.\n\nHer presence felt strange, like I wasn’t even seeing my mother. After what she said, I was sure her words were being pupiteered. When mom went to work, after yelling that there were leftovers on the counter, I was left with the soundtrack of a stupid dripping tap, and our humming refrigerator. I made several promises to myself in the time I was in the kitchen. \n\nI would save Casper and his siblings, and then I’d force mom to drive all of us out of town. There were logistics I didn’t want to think about. These were feverish thoughts which controlled me. I had to get them out of that house. Time seemed to go by slowly. When I lifted my head from where I’d been staring at leftover meatballs I dropped onto the table, my phone vibrated in my jeans. Pulling it out, there was a DM regarding my post I wrote on here.\n\nI read it. Then I read it again and again until I could process it.\n\n“Film it. Literally get evidence of what is going on with Casper. You need people to believe you. And if people are going to believe you, you need to make a scene. If you want that house stormed, make as much noise as possible. I know it sounds stupid, but think about it like this. All you need is attention. Mrs Wilder can’t hide from the world if you show the world what’s going on. Good luck, Phoebe. Please be safe.”\n\n-- A friend.\n\nI was shaking when I knocked on the Wilder’s door fifteen minutes later. I knew exactly how to cause a scene.\n\nMrs Wilder answered, her expression cross between frustrated and bewildered.  But I could barely focus on her, or the fact that she was holding a ladle like a weapon. The second the door opened revealing Casper’s mom drowning in a homely golden light, something slammed into me. Nothing physical, though it might as well have been. I forced myself to breathe through the stink which hit me like a brick to the face, suffocating my nose and mouth. Lavender. Not just lavender. The expensive flowers mom would get grocery shopping. \n\nThe ones which made me sneeze when I leaned too close. The house stunk of flowers—and that was just from standing on the threshold. But I knew better. I knew, once sweet smelling salts and flowers entwined in my senses, that the stink was to cover something up. And the more I edged closer over the threshold, the true smell of the Wilder house began to snake into my nose. Rot. I had once left a donut under my bed as a kid as an experiment to see if I could grow a whole new species. But this wasn’t mouldy food. It was far more potent. More like a decaying animal.\n\n“Phoebe!” Mrs Wilder folded her arms across her apron. “I’m sorry, were my instructions not clear?” She cocked her head, an amused smile curving on her lips. She was triumphant, knowing exactly how to get under my skin.  “Are you aware of what a restraining order is?”\n\nIgnoring the smell choking the air, I held up my phone. “I’m live on Instagram.” I said. “Can I come in?”\n\nI’m not sure why, but seeing her cheeks turn white made me feel like I was the one in control. “I’m sorry, what?”\n\n“Live.” I repeated with a cheery wave. “On Instagram.”\n\nI expected her to shove me back, or call out my bluff (yes, I was bluffing). Instead though, the women’s resolve seemed to crumble, her expression twisting, fear igniting in her eyes. She stammered for a moment, her gaze flashing to my phone before she wrapped her arms around herself and seemed to force a nod. “This is my house.” Her voice came out in a hiss. \n\nMrs Wilder was talking straight to the camera, and clearly faking terror. “Phoebe Daly, this is far past your usual games. This is… this is trespassing! Do you hear me? I’m calling the police!” Mrs Wilder didn’t call the police. \n\nShe held her phone to her ear but didn’t dare dial a number. I could see her options flitting across her eyes.\n\nWas she going to attack me, or play it cool? Playing it cool, it was. With a face like thunder, she stumbled aside when I took a step forward and asked to be let inside. I wasn’t live on Instagram. I had barely 10 followers. \n\nBut she didn’t know that. Instead of being live, I was filming everything with my normal phone camera, angled at a height so she couldn’t slap it out of my hands. Watching her stumble back, panic twisting her expression into fury and frustration filled me with satisfaction. I had her. The crazy witch really thought I was streaming. I used that to my advantage, making sure to commentate to my imaginary audience as she led me down the main hallway, and I made sure to point the camera at everything I could see. Kids photographs covered neat paintwork. \n\nBut they were all different young children taken from a distance. Towards the end of the hall, what I saw did send my heart into my gut. And for a moment—just a brief second—I actually felt sympathy for Casper’s mom. \n\nFour ultrasound’s. \n\nI didn’t let the camera linger on them, instead going to the woman herself, who was following me, trying and failing to stall my effort to delve further inside the house. She stepped in front of me with a huff. “Phoebe. That is enough! You have terrorised me to no end!” her voice rose into a whine. “Whoever you are, Phoebe’s friends! This brat is targeting my children!”\n\n“Casper!” I yelled, ignoring her. “Are you there?”\n\nNo answer.\n\nMy heart dropped into my gut, though I wasn’t giving up. I had the advantage, and I had to play to it.\n\n“Casper!”\n\nI ran up the first few steps leading upstairs, but Mrs Wilder seemed far too focused on shielding the door at the end of the hall.\n\n“What’s in the kitchen?” I asked with a lump in my throat. Backing down the stairs, I made my way towards her.\n\n“Nothing is in the kitchen!” she spat back, feigning innocence. “We’re having dinner if you must know. And you are ruining it!”  \n\nI shook my head. “This is Mrs Wilder,” I announced, pointing the phone at her. “She is holding four teenagers against their will and claiming them as her own children.” I said smoothly. When we reached a sliding glass door leading into the kitchen, I grabbed the handle with force.\n\nHer rough hand slammed over mine, claw-like fingernails slicing my flesh. “Get out of my house,” she said stiffly. “Young lady, you are trespassing on my property.” Every word came out in globules of saliva hitting me in the face. “I have never met such a disruptive and outright disrespectful child without discipline. Your mother should be ashamed of herself.” She shot a nervous look at my phone camera.\n\n“Where’s Mrs Becker?” I asked.\n\n“What?”\n\nMrs Becker.” I repeated. “She helped you kidnap and scare me into staying quiet the other day. So, where is she?”\n\nShe spluttered, clearly caught off guard. “You are delusional!”\n\n“Then show me them.” I said, pointing the camera at the door. “Your children, Mrs Wilder. I want you to show me Issac, Matilda, Freddie, and…” I swallowed hard. “And Casper.” Ignoring her steel grasp on the door handle, I pulled it open, trying to ignore the sudden squawking noise which had escaped her mouth, slamming into my ears. I can’t describe it. Mom has spoken about a mother instinct, and I wonder if it truly was that. This was animalistic. Feral. \n\nImmediately, Mrs Wilder was behind me like a beast, her trembling arms trying to grasp hold of me and drag me back violently. But I was stronger, and desperate. I had to know the Wilder's secret.  Stepping over the threshold, I was first aware of a far dimmer light. And when I fully focused on the room, I realised I was seeing candlelight. In front of me was a hardwood dining room table, and five chairs—four of which were occupied.  The kitchen was a copy of our own. Except ours had always been lit up and bright.\n\nIt felt more like I was stepping inside a cave. An orangeade blur illuminated each face. Three out of four bodies sat stiff, almost… doll like. Mechanical. The way the three were facing me. Their expressions matched perfectly. Wide eyes and wider grins splitting lips apart. I drank each Wilder kid in slowly, as my brain struggled to take in the real horror of the room. What I was failing to fully take in. I couldn’t. I don’t think I could physically understand what I was seeing. I was aware my phone had slipped from my fingers, that I was paralysed to the spot.\n\nThe smell of stink and rot, I thought.\n\nIt was them.\n\nI couldn’t move. There were three boys, and one girl. Matilda Wilder was a mousey redhead while her brothers were all brunettes. She wore a purple dress which fit her perfectly, her hair tied into pigtails with red ribbons. Issac and Freddie Wilder sat shoulder to shoulder. \n\nThey were the twins, I thought dizzily. They were identical twins in Mrs Wilder’s eyes, but these guys looked nothing like each other—one of them sporting a handsome face and razor jawline, while the other had an odd looking nose and jutting chin. Still though, I could tell Mrs Wilder had made an effort to make them look… beautiful. Perfect. I could see her attempt at stitching their lips together.  \n\nIt wasn’t their appearance that was gluing me to the ground, however. Because looking closer, past the made-up faces on both the boys and the girls, the ribbons and fancy clothes and empty eyes staring right through me, soft candlelight was slowly bringing them to life in front of me. These kids had been hidden away for so long, and I was finally seeing them for who they were.  My gaze flicked to each of them. I was seeing… stitches. I was seeing rugged stitches and gashes in their flesh, patchwork skin making up fingers and elbows and cheeks. They had been taken apart over and over again and put back together. \n\nMatilda’s neck was a collage of flesh, rugged markings where a marker pen had clumsily sliced into her skin and pieced her like a jigsaw through mangled body parts and anything left over. Freddie and Isaac’s heads were cocked at an angle, and looking closer I glimpsed the bad stitch-job which had knitted them together.\n\nI could see it in all of them. None of these kids were their original selves. They reminded me of dolls built through old doll pieces. I didn’t know I was screaming until the gravity of the situation hit me, and I realised I was suffocating on dead skin which made them up, their bodies stitched and knitted together, transforming them into her ideal children. Flickering candlelight revealed the last Wilder kid. \n\nThere were two significant things which were different about Casper.\n\nThe first, was that he must have been her most recent. He was her most… original—and the second? Unlike the others, he was awake.\n\nUntil that moment, Casper had been sitting amongst his siblings, head cocked to the side like the others, catatonic.\n\nHis dazed eyes slowly found mine—and I glimpsed recognition flickering in his expression, his rigid body starting to contort back to life. He was her paper-doll.\n\nBut Casper wasn’t finished.\n\n“Phoebe?” When the boy spoke, his voice was barely a whimper. Frenzied eyes flicked from Matilda to Issac and Freddie, all of which were still wearing their perfect smiles.  I noticed the rugged skin of his neck, and my heart sank.\n\nSomething was moving behind him, and I forced myself to step forwards. I glimpsed that same chord-like thing. This time it was fully attacked to him. No, it was buried directly inside his head. A sour paste crept up my throat when I saw the carnivorous hole burrowing deeper inside his head. I could glimpse the intense  white of chipped skull and a strange looking fluid leaking out —but it looked… wrong. I’ve always imagined the internals of someone’s brain to be pinkish grey. Though  what I was seeing was more like a black ooze sliding down the back of his neck. It reminded me of squid-ink. Definitely not blood. \n\nIt looked like he had been shot in the head, or had been pulled out of the operating theatre mid-surgery. And somehow, he was still alive. Just like the description, the chord-thing seemed to be attached in two places—to the back of the head, directly on the brain, and stapled to his spine. The device was humming, but I don’t think it was working. \n\nCasper was looking directly at me, and the way his body was angled was different to his siblings. Instead of sitting straight, he was trying and failing to jump to his feet, his eyes wide, almost unseeing. I could see that frustration and anger, that pain from the other night alive in his face. I opened my mouth to speak, though Casper was already lifting a trembling hand, his fingers twining around the chord and giving a pathetic tug.  A thin line of dark red, almost black, slid from his nostril.\n\nI knew it was him. “Can you… can you get… it… out?” His hand found the chord again, and his grasp slipped. “Please.” He whispered, squeezing his eyes shut. “There’s something… in my… my head, and I need you to… I need you to fucking get it out…. right now.”\n\n“Casper.” I couldn’t resist a relieved hiss. “This woman.” I twisted and pointed at Mrs Wilder. \n\n“Who is she to you?”\n\nThe kid blinked, his eyes narrowing. He jolted, twisting around to try and see the thing attached to him. “Why would I know her? Get this shit out of my head!”\n\nHe let out a hysterical yell. His cry was more of a demand, and that nameless boy underneath splintered doll pieces began to unravel.\n\n“Get it out.” He kept repeating. “Fucking get it out! There’s something inside my head!”\n\nI nodded, choking back a cry.\n\nHe slammed his hands down, but seemingly couldn’t move from the chair. “What the fuck.” He side eyed the others. “What the fuck is this?”\n\nI struggled to answer without screaming myself. “Stuff.” I managed to get out through a sputter. “Can you stand up?”\n\n“What?” He blinked rapidly at me, I was seeing it again. That odd light flickering in his pupils. \n\n“No. I can’t move!”\n\nThe humming grew louder, and at the corner of my eye, that thing seemed to dig deeper inside his head.\n\nMore blood spurted from his nose, and I could tell that he was fighting it.\n\nThe boy’s eyes found mine, his words tangling into an almost slur. “Get it out! I can’t… I can’t fucking think straight. I…. I….”\n\nHis eyes rolled back for a moment before he shook his head, lunging against the chair. His head twitched. “I don’t know I am.”\n\nI couldn’t move. Watching this thing take control in real time, it was both fascinating and horrifying, sending my knees buckling.\n\n“Who… who am I?”\n\nHis whole head twitched, like he was glitching.\n\n“I know her. I… I know her. I’m her… I’m her son… I’m her s—son.”\n\nCasper hummed, his twitching lips pricking into a demented smile. “I’ll always know her. She’s the one who… who s---saved me.”\n\nChoking on a shade too vivid and dark to be blood, he sputtered, his head drooping.\n\n“Mom?” Casper spoke through mouthfuls of pooling black. He lifted his head, unseeing eyes blinking in dim candlelight. The chord-like thing sounded more like it was drilling into his brain, and I knew I was fucked when his lips spread out into a childlike smile, and he swayed to the left and then the right, the light in his eyes burning. “There’s… water.” He whispered. “So… so cold. I’m so cold.” His voice broke. \n\n“I don’t… want to be cold.”\n\n“You won’t be cold.” Mrs Wilder’s voice was a sharp cry behind me. “Ever again. Your mom is here.”\n\n“Promise? You n… need to… prom…promise me.” His teeth chattered. “You need to… tell me… I won’t… be cold. That my mom… is coming.”\n\n“I promise, darling.”\n\n“Mommy?”\n\n“No,” I swallowed back frustrated tears. “Casper, she’s not your mother!”\n\nHis next words split into a guttural screech which almost sent him toppling off of the chair. He grabbed at his head, clawing at face.\n\nBut the more he was tugging, the machine fought against him. I could see metallic clamp-like legs stubbornly holding on.\n\nHis next words were mangled between cries from his conscious self, and whatever the fuck his ‘mother’ was forcing into his head. \n\nAnd yet it barely grazed my ears. I was trying to figure out how to get that monumental THING out of his brain. There was no way I could just pull it out. That could kill him, right?  \n\nI started forwards to grab him, to try and pry the clamp off his spine,  before I was being smothered with the stink of rich lavender. I hadn’t noticed Mrs Wilder swipe up my phone. She was holding it up in the air. “Live? You were never filming anything, you stupid girl! Do you understand what you have done?” She laughed—and I mean cackled like a witch. “I warned you, didn’t I?”\n\nI got one last glimpse of Casper. His whole body was jerking under the chord inside his head, but he wasn’t crying out anymore.\n\nBefore I knew what was happening, I was being dragged back, and in front of me a Wilder boy shoving his struggling brother back into the chair. I didn’t have time to cry out. \n\nWith strength I had no idea the crazy bitch had, I was being violently yanked by my hair. And while I was flailing, I saw the ultrasound’s once again. Looking closer though, each one had a different name. A different mother. My head spun. That couldn’t be right. Mrs Wilder told me she was pregnant with four children, so who’s ultrasound’s were these? And why had she framed them? I didn’t have time to check it out.\n\nI was dumped on my ass and the door was slammed straight in my face. I tried to get back in,  throwing my fists into the door, until my own mother’s arms were pulling me back. I was hysterical. I couldn’t breathe, and mom wasn’t getting through to me. I’d kicked and thrown myself into the door, attracting the attention of our neighbours. That’s what I wanted. I wanted one of them to call the police, and when I picked up a brick, struggling against mom’s attempt to restrain me, and throwing it through the Wilder’s front window, I finally got it. \n\nTwo cops arrived, and I was so relieved I almost sobbed into one officers chest. While my mom was trying and failing to explain my “breakdown” I begged them to take a look inside. And I was loud. I was screaming. \n\nWhich they couldn’t ignore. \n\n“Phoebe!” I was partially aware of mom’s voice trying to calm me down, but I all I could see was that thing in Casper’s head, and his siblings made from knitted flesh. When the officer’s exited the Wilder’s house after five painful minutes waiting, I stumbled over to the two.\n\n“Well?” I demanded, shoving away my mom. “Did you see them?” I yelled. “She’s turned them into… into dolls!” I was already going on a tangent, hysteria plunging me further into my own insanity. \n\n“They’re not her children.” I gritted out. “She kidnapped and.. and stitched them up like… like Frankenstein! Mrs Wilder likes dolls! She had this paper-doll of me when she kidnapped me and lit it on fire to threaten me because I was talking to Casper. And he… he’s one of them, and not even her son! She’s controlling his mind with this thing stuck inside—\"\n\n“That’s enough!” Mom snapped.\n\nThe officer in front of me chuckled. “Breathe, kid!” He said. “Jeez. You’re not even giving us time to talk.”\n\n“What?”\n\nInstead of speaking to me directly, the officer turned to mom. “There’s nothing out of the ordinary, ma’am.” He said. “The Wilder’s were enjoying a family dinner, and…” his gaze flashed to me. “Well. It appears someone ruined it. There are no current reports of child abduction.”\n\nI couldn’t resist a laugh. “Are you serious? Did you not… did you not see—”\n\nHe cut me off. “There they are!” He  chuckled. “The Wilder siblings!” The officer saluted the four of them who had wandered outside trailing their mother. Ignoring the other three, I made my way over to Casper. But he looked… I don’t know, he looked like he usually did through his window? There were no stitches or patchwork skin. He was wearing a beanie, and I reached to yank it off, when his hand caught mine. \n\nHe was freezing cold. \n\nHis skin felt almost slimy, like I was touching the skin of a dead fish. I wanted to hold on, to force the cops to believe me, but he was already speaking—his voice was different, a lot deeper than the hysterical cry of the boy underneath.  “Mom?” Casper’s eyes were cold. He shoved my hand away before taking a shaky step back.  Like I was crazy. He quickly joined his siblings. \n\n“Who is this girl?”\n\n“We’re going home.” Mom said, grasping my arm. “Can’t you see you’ve embarrassed me enough?”\n\n“Phoebe, huh?”\n\nI turned to find the other Wilder kids. The guy with the jawline still had that doll-like smile. “Please leave our brother alone.”\n\nI couldn’t resist spitting at him. “He’s not your brother. You’re brainwashed.”\n\nSomething in his expression seemed to twitch suddenly. Mom tried to pull me back, but I stubbornly stayed where I was.\n\nIssac or Freddie cocked his head.  “Brain... washed?\"\n\nHe started to speak, before Mrs Wilder ushered them all away. But I did notice him turn back to frown at me.\n\nNeedless to say, I was grounded—and threatened with a restraining order.\n\nThat didn’t stop me peeking through gap in Casper’s curtains that night. That didn’t stop me peeking through gasp in Casper’s curtains that night. I caught him stumbling around, struggling to get the chord-thing out of his head with manic hands. He came over to the window several times, his bloody hands slamming into the window before slipping away. I'm not sure, but I don't think he knew why his legs kept drawing him to the window. \n\nMrs Wilder joined him soon after, forcing him to bite into something plastic, as she led him to sit on the bed, her fingers wrapping around the chord, and yanking it out. I didn't hear his scream, but his reaction to it, body writhing, eyes squeezing shut, I knew he could feel it. And part of him was awake. Just part of him.\n\nNot the parts who knew our window sessions and his horrifying reality.\n\nCasper came to his window all bandaged up. He didn’t hold up a message, and his eyes were vacant.\n\nThough his expression told me everything I needed to know.\n\nEngines woke me up several hours later. It was midnight. Sliding out of bed, my gaze went straight to Casper’s window. But it was dark. I pressed my face against my own window and glimpsed Mrs Wilder standing on her lawn in her robe. \n\nA car pulled up, and the cop from earlier jumped out. In his arms was what looked like a body bag. He dropped it on the ground. “Freshly dead.” He said, when I opened my window to hear what was being said. “Car crash. Victim is male. Eighteen years old.” He folded his arms with a light laugh. “I got him straight from the morgue. His parents think there’s no body.” Both of them knelt next to the bag, and Mrs Wilder zipped it open with a hiss.\n\nWhen the bag jolted suddenly, I realised the body was still alive.\n\nThe officer stumbled back. “Jesus. I didn’t even use that much. You said a single shot, right?”\n\n“Mmm.”\n\nMrs Wilder pulled out a carving knife from her robe, and I felt my entire body turn to ice.\n\nThe cop raised a brow. “You came prepared.”\n\nShe sighed, her hands on her hips. “He’s spare parts. The expiry is approaching which is why they’re… acting out.”\n\nWith startling precision, she aimed the knife above what I guessed was the body’s head, before bringing it down with a sickening crunch. The bag stopped squirming.\n\nI can’t remember anything else from that night.\n\nMy mother was gone the next morning. A paper doll replica of her was sitting next to a note and a plate of freshly baked cookies.\n\n-\n\n“Dearest, Phoebe.\n\nI baked these thinking of you! And my, you should be grateful I have even bothered to do this after playing your games last night. Honestly, I am not the monster you think I am. Your mom asked me to let you know she will be busy with me for a few hours. \n\nI’ve been asked to take care of you, so here are some chocolate cookies! Please maintain the rule I set in place and do not go near or talk to my children. I’m sure you know what will happen if you happen to slip up. I took the liberty of asking your mother to fit specialised devices  in your room so I know when you are talking to my son. Writing equipment has been taken away. I hope we can be friends and I can start calling you my daughter.\n\nIf something were to happen to your mom, do not worry. I will take you in. I want you to remember that.\n\nLove,\n\nMrs Wilder.\n\nPS: I can’t wait for you to (not) meet my newest son! ",

        "text": "[VERIFICATION REQUIRED]\n\nEnter Credentials: T.LEON\n\nEnter Password: ************\n\n \n\n[ACCESS GRANTED]\n\nOpening EWI\\MR\\Triton9\\8232022\n\n\n     The Blackhawk helicopter touched down on a small clearing just south of an overpass bridge. The organization that employs my team and me had the surrounding area evacuated hours prior, due to an apparent \"hazardous waste spill.\" It's almost always that. While there would, hopefully, be no civilian interference, I always get worked up about taking my first step away from the safety of the helicopter. Most of my squad carry combat rifles modified to fire .308 rounds, which will stop any person that needs to be dealt with. But we don't deal with normal people, or even people for that matter. If my team is sent in to eliminate a threat, chances are that threat needs to be hit with something much harder. Soon enough, we'd most likely have our work cut out for us with demonic forces. That's our specialty.\n\n\n     I swept my barrel across every nook and cranny I could see, as my flashlight illuminated the concrete structures. My squad mate, a young woman from Morocco named Yara Hakim, performed the same action to my right. After a few moments, she turned to me and nodded her head, signalling the all clear. I talked into my radio, telling my CO that the area was secure. A large man hopped out of the helicopter, followed by three others. They all wore the same thing as me and Yara, tan and grey uniforms with large black suits of exo-armor and a full face helmet. \n\n\n     \"Scorpius, this is Triton-9,\" the large man from the helicopter said into his radio. \"We have arrived at the incident site. Proceeding down.\"\n\n\n     A woman replied over the radio, enabling the entire squad to hear. \"Affirmative, Commander Jorgensen. Supernatural forces reported one kilometer from your position. Your technician has the map of the tunnel system already, proceed with caution.\"\n\n\n     \"Copy,\" Jorgensen responded in a thick Danish accent. \"Over and out.\"\n\n\n     The Blackhawk began to lift off and fly away as we made our way over to a large metal hatch close to a support pillar. We all surrounded it, as Jorgensen gave his orders. \n\n\n     \"Kenju, Hakim, on the cover. Santos and Flaherty, be ready for descent. Leon, be ready for suppressing fire.\"\n\n\n     Like clockwork, we all took our positions. Hakim and Kenju scanned the landing area and surrounding concrete structures for any sign of trouble. Santos, Flaherty and I aimed our barrels toward the hatch, ready to send anything that moved the wrong way back to hell. The Commander grabbed hold of the hatch with his massive armored hand and lifted it up. The sheer force he used to open it almost ripped the hatch from its fixture. Jorgensen backed away so nothing could catch him off guard without his rifle, while Flaherty, Santos and I peered down with our weapons drawn. The flashlights mounted on our rifles shone down into the tunnel, lighting up all sorts of grime and filth, but nothing that posed a threat. \n\n\n     Jorgensen pointed at Santos, then Flaherty, and motioned down toward the ladder that had been illuminated by our lights. Santos nodded, then slung his rifle on his back. He took hold of the first rung and swung his legs over to begin descending. Jorgensen and I aimed down at the sides of Santos, while Lieutenant Flaherty prepared to follow him. Santos reached the bottom of the ladder and spun around, taking his rifle off of his back. He aimed it down the tunnel, from which our vision was obscured. After a moment, he raised his hand and wagged his fingers, signalling he had Flaherty covered.\n\n\n     Flaherty began descending the ladder, and as she did, Jorgensen motioned for Hakim and Kenju. They trotted over to our position, while Jorgensen and I scanned our surroundings. I heard the lieutenant call over the radio that she had made it down, and she and Santos had the base of the ladder covered. Commander Jorgensen told Kenju and Hakim to climb down, as we covered them. Once the two of them had made it down, I began my way down. It was pretty dark, the only thing I could see were the lights from the others bouncing off the walls below. Once I heard the clanking of my large metal boots hit the concrete landing, I took hold of my rifle and prepared to cover Jorgensen as he came down. \n\n\n     Soon enough, everyone had formed up in the subterranean tunnel, and we began moving to the target area. Jorgensen had left Santos to protect the entrance, and as we embarked, he started to set up a couple small sentry turrets. Hakim had let her weapon rest on her back and pulled out her sidearm, a Desert Eagle. She also had her small phone-sized computer in her hand, with a diagram of the tunnel system. Our objective was to make our way to a tent city underground that had apparently been overrun by a small army of demons. Usually, demon attacks are pretty routine. While there are a shit-ton this time, from what our intelligence network had gathered, they were just simple demons. \n\n\n     Yara told us we had about one hundred meters to go until the entrance to the underground clearing that housed the homeless encampment. I prepared myself for the horrors that were about to come. While my team had dealt with plenty of hellspawn, the average person has no clue what to do. Even if they did, they most likely didn't have a heavy-hitting rifle loaded with rounds blessed by priests, shamans or imams. The tricky thing about demons is their hide is thicker than an elephant's, and even if you pierce their skin, they will probably just walk it off if a holy bullet doesn't banish their mortal vessel back to whichever hell they came from. Long story short, they are a pain in the ass to deal with. \n\n\n     We approached the entrance to the large room, and a faint orange glow filled my vision. Faint screams could be heard over the crackle of flames and miscellaneous banging of metal. Hakim approached the door with Jorgensen at her back, as Flaherty, Kenju and I moved across to the other side of the makeshift door. Jorgensen tapped Hakim on her shoulder, indicating he wanted to sneak past her and get a look inside. Jorgensen poked his head through the door, and Flaherty did the same on the other side.\n\n\n     \"Oh shit,\" Jorgensen muttered. That couldn't mean anything good. \"Well, it's demons alright.\"\n\n\n     \"Yeah,\" Flaherty replied. Her head scanned the room from side to side, before abruptly snapping back to where she was looking a few moments ago. \"Is that what I think it is?!\"\n\n\n     I could almost always understand Flaherty well enough, but when she was angry, her Irish accent would become flustered and a little incoherent. She backed up, shaking her head in the process. I looked over at Kenju, and we both took a look for ourselves, trying to see what all the fuss was about. After a moment of looking around, my eyes found what Lieutenant Flaherty was so upset about. Close to the back wall of the clearing, sitting atop a pile of garbage, was the demon Telacor. For a bit of context, Telacor was a nuisance and a half. He was something like the Forrest Gump of demons, if there was some demonic incursion to our realm, chances are this mother fucker was there for it. \n\n     \n\n     Just then, before we could strategize, a small demon came toward the entrance, dragging a homeless man by his legs. The demon cackled to itself, apparently proud of the flaying work it had performed on the man earlier. It dropped the man's legs and brushed its hand off before turning to see Jorgensen. The wretch barely gasped before Jorgensen grabbed the damn thing by its throat and squeezed. The demon's eyes bulged out of its skull as our commander punched it in the face, sending it flying back into the rubble behind us. I lined up a shot, but the little bastard was too quick. It scampered off into the room, screaming its head off. \n\n\n     Every demon in the room looked over to see the five of us standing there. Their leader, that shit-for-brains Telacor pointed at us and hissed some foul incantation. All of his minions stopped torturing the people that remained alive and started barreling toward us.\n\n\n     \"Open fire!\" Jorgensen hollered. \"Take out as many as you can.\"\n\n\n     We began firing at any demon that came near. Most of them went down after a few bullets, but some were more resistant. Kenju blasted the bigger ones with his marksman rifle as the rest of us fired on the nearest demon. I almost shot a woman who came running out of the room. She had what looked like nails sticking out of her skin, covering her body.\n\n\n     \"Ma'am, get down!\" Flaherty shouted. \"Make your way over here!\"\n\n\n     The woman half crawled, half scuttled over toward Flaherty, who in turn pushed the homeless woman behind her. The lady ducked into a corner away from the chaos and covered her ears as the ringing of an absurd amount of bullets flying through the air made my ears begin to hurt, even through the armored helmet. I turned my head to face our flank, as a booming sound had begun to bear down on us from the dark hall. I swung my light, and consequently my rifle, down in the direction of the noise to see another horde of the hellish beasts barreling down on the six of us. \n\n\n     \"Commander!\" I shouted. \"We have incoming bogeys!\"\n\n\n     The team leader whipped his head over to where I had alerted him. He swore into his mic, and motioned for us to begin pulling back. \n\n\n     \"Retreat to the entrance!\" Jorgensen shouted over his radio. \"Santos! Do you copy?\"\n\n\n     \"Yes, boss,\" Santos answered. \"Are you guys clear?\"\n\n \n\n     \"Does it sound like we're clear?! What's your status?\"\n\n\n     \"I'm set, Commander. Not a sound from anything other than some rats.\"\n\n\n     \"Okay, we are wrapping up here, call in for exfil!\"\n\n\n     Santos confirmed the order, as we kept firing on the hordes bearing down on us. We were cleaning the beasts up nicely, but they kept coming. A massive pile of ash was accumulating from where the demon's violently exploded as their souls were sent back to Hell. Jorgenson switched between shooting the wretched beasts and pummeling them with his fists, while the rest of us rapidly fired holy bullets into any demon that dared near our position. We ran back to rendezvous with Santos, taking turns laying covering fire and retreating.\n\n\n     Soon enough, we had reached Santos. I heard him call out and he told us to get behind the sentry turrets as he activated them. The turrets rapidly fired into the oncoming crowd of devils, as the rest of us caught our breath. Before the demons could halt their attack, they were being torn into left and right, ash filling up the tunnel from the preposterous amounts of hellspawn being sent back to the netherworld. By the time the turrets were drained of their ammunition, only a few demons that had not turned tail and ran poked their heads out from the ruined tunnels. Among them was that dumb bastard Telacor.\n\n\n     \"My master will not be pleased,\" the demon hissed at us, pointing his fat fingers at each of us. His words slurred like he hadn't held an actual conversation in years. \"Your souls will be harvested for the pleasures of those I serve.\"\n\n\n     \"Perhaps,\" Flaherty retorted. \"But not today.\" \n\n\n     She aimed her rifle at Telacor, attempting to finish him off. He could take quite a beating, more so than his minions, but in the open and with a hailstorm of holy rounds, he would go down like the rest. Just as Flaherty fixed her sights on the trifling demon before us, a portal opened behind it. He performed a short, mock bow before leaping through the rift. It closed as we fired into it, having no effect. The remaining few demons looked at each other, then toward us. We picked them off with ease. \n\n\n     After that, everything went on as normal. A Blackhawk came to pick us up, along with the surviving homeless woman, who somehow was still clinging to life. We were debriefed by command on the mission, thanked for our valiant effort, and sent on our way. This operation was fairly routine for our squad. While we don't do this every day, Triton-9 has done it enough where some missions seem more lackluster than others. Of course, I have more tales from my service in the Extranormal Warfare Initiative, and I'm sure I'll have them posted in the coming days. Until then, stay safe.

        "text": "Me, a 43-year-old experienced scientist with my small team of 2 people, Tony and Jack in Antarctica. I have been around unique, scary and beautiful parts of the world since I graduated from college which took me over 5 years, five years of tears, lack of sleep and studying just to be called a scientist.\n\nAs I mentioned before, I have been all around the world for research and job, but it's my first time in Antarctica. We've been here for over 4 days. Our base is a big-sized Russian tent from the previous researchers who didn't make it home in the middle of nothing except ice. None of them, none of them made it home. They all went missing and we are here just to replace and finish the job they began. Hopefully, the tent is big enough to keep the advanced equipment we require to full fill our mission, which is to gain samples and later match them with samples from Siberia or other places. Our second priority is to see any changes in the weather and temperature here, this is to keep a record of it and try to prevent global warming by adjusting the procedures used to stop it. The media may not tell you, but the earth's situation is worse than you may think.\n\nWe're wandering daily around the desert of ice to collect samples which are ice with some bacteria on them. One day, we decided to expand our journey and go further when the winds calm down a bit. Winds are so strong that they can easily knock you down if you try to walk during them, that's why we don't want to risk anything, our supervisors who are sitting in a warm, cozy place are prohibiting us from doing it too. Back to the trip, we ignored found bacteria and other things to have test tubes for what we could find further there. As we walked on, Tony shouted at us and said that he saw a small lake or water point which is really unique for the ice desert, no, it wasn't the artic ocean or other big seas, we are in the middle of Antarctica. \n\nWe came closer to the water just to see that it isn't frozen, it is my first time in Antarctica but I know that it is impossible in that temperatures, I want to remind you that the average temperature here is minus 25°C and we also can not stay for too long outside, our suits aren't capable for it. The water seemed blue, we couldn't see anything in it. The first thing we did was to take some samples inside the test tubes, we were witnessing something truly scary and amazing! By the time when Tony put the test tube inside the water, it just broke completely. Such a thing shouldn't happen, even if the water is really cold, the test tubes were too tough to shatter. Tony put another test tube and again, it broke. We saw no point in doing that, so we tried to at least take the temperature of the water. I reached for the thermometer when suddenly, a huge wind knocked us to the ground. The sky began to be gray along with the wind, it was so strong that we could see it. We ran back as fast as we could, leaving some of the equipment behind, I believe it was a metal detector and something else.\n\nWe barely could make it to the tent. Upon our arrival, I couldn't feel anything, not a part of my body. We took off the suits, shoes and helmets to check if anything isn't frostbitten. Hopefully, nothing was black meaning we could keep our fingers without getting them amputated. Each of us got to stage 2 frostbite which can be healed if you stay warm.\n\nI headed to my bed exhausted and scared of what happened right before. I sat on it trying to process what just happened over and over again, when I heard Jack's voice, he called me for a second. I came to them and I froze for a second. The compass.... it was showing the direction of the West. I took the compass and tried to shake, hit it or anything to see it move. No, it was still showing West. Compasses do not work in Antarctica, they are being affected too much by the magnetic pole and simply spin around. We tried to discuss how did it work or think of any logical explanation, but we couldn't.\n\nSeeing the storm outside, I knew we would be trapped here for another day. I noticed that we haven't really explored this tent, since our arrival we were too busy unpacking and trying to boost the operations that we had no time to do it. In a small closet that was meant to be used for the suits, I found a notebook. The cover was plain black, I picked it up, opened it and found out that it was a diary of I believe the previous crew of this station. The pages and book itself were in perfect condition. I sat down by my bed and started flipping pages, it was a total of 17 days. The diary was written in Russian, but I could read it with ease, the college helped at least in one thing. It changed everything, things I found written there freaked me out so much that I was scared to go outside. I am going to quote the most disturbing days I found in this diary. \n\n\nDay 1 \nMe and my crew arrived, we have now unpacked and we're preparing for tomorrow to go explore\n\nDay 4\nWe still didn't get a chance to go out due to extremal winds, I believe they shouldn't last this long...\n\nDay 7\nWe found something like a virus, it's surprising that it can survive in such temperatures. We came to the base and tried to do anything with it. The DNA wasn't matching with any specie known on earth, did we discover something new?\n\nDay 10\nI am losing my mind, we found a lake nearly 10 kilometers from the base. My assistant put his hand in the water and it was... amputated. Just like it was acid?? We're sending an emergency call.\n\nDay 12\nHe's dead. Not because of the blood loss. Something wanted him dead. I didn't mention it, but we keep hearing strange noises from the outside. The body begins to rot, we are about to throw it outside to the storm.\n\nDay 15\nWhy are they not here yet? We disrupted someone's peace. It's another day when we are locked in the tent due to the storm. It's peeking from the window.\n\nDay 16\nI am not schizophrenic!!! We can see something from the window!!! PLEASE, WE WANT TO CANCEL THIS STUPID MISSION\n\nDay 17\nHe, he went outside to check on the body. He was dragged by the creature to the lake's direction? I don't know. I lost sense of orientation. I can not keep this any longer. I must go outside for my friend.\n\n\n\nI didn't sleep all night. My only goal was to check if it was not a joke. The next day, I took everything along with my team and went outside to check back on that water source. We arrived and found the metal detector, or its pieces by the water. I throw my goggles in the water, but, nothing happened? I took them back without my hand being amputated or something. We all took samples of the water and went back to the base.\n\nI took the diary again to make sure I was conscious and sober while reading it yesterday, I saw the whole story again unchanged. \n\nAfter like 25 days, our mission has successfully finished. We prepared to come back home and celebrate our survival. We sent a message on the radio. Waiting for the familiar voice to respond, we caught the news channel by accident, I don't know how is it possible, the radio is programmed to catch a signal from the government. We heard something that left us traumatized. The news reporter was saying that the US, government has fallen due to terror from something unknown. Everyone in North America was killed from what we heard the next day. We kept trying to contact the Danish government to take us back from this place, but the only thing we heard was that the terror bas began in Eastern Europe, for the same reason. The final thing we heard was the news reporter's voice, which said to hide and avoid a 20 meter tall black creature, from his voice we could say that countries are planning a nuclear attack on that thing. We also heard mentions of European countries and their government being terminated by it, most of Europe has fallen victim to it.\n\n\nIs this the end? Are we going to die here? Is it just an illusion? What continent is next? Is mankind heading to... the end?",
