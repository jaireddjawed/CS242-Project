Due to my previous education I was not able to memorise the multiplication table and often still count simple addition with fingers.

I'm also not entirely sure about academia because of the supposedly under paid and over worked researchers.\n\nMath: Similar to physics, I love math and I'm currently doing courses on Linear Algebra and Multivariable Calculus, so things are getting really interesting. I also like that this is a very general subject and I could probably specialize after a bachelors in CS or another math adjacent field.\n\nEngineering: Engineering is interesting and I'm willing to put in the work, but I'm mostly attracted to it for the high salary. I just don't want to regret chasing money and missing out on learning more advanced physics or math.\n\nI'm currently leaning towards doing a double major in Math and Physics, because they share a lot of courses and compliment each other well. With my AP credits I could finish this in 4 years with a fairly normal course load.\n\nObviously, I've gathered this info from reading about people's experience on the internet, so please give me your thoughts on what I should do.",

I think this is the deepest dive available on the internet to date. The math is mostly real analysis with topological arguments, some measure theory sprinkled in, a lot of focus on Baire class functions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways I've seen many discussions here over the years about Ted's math career and hopefully this answers some of the lingering questions from those threads. Thanks for watching.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD4xrnzKN1Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD4xrnzKN1Y)",

If the coin lands heads, he moves three numbers up. If the coin lands tails he moves one number back. The man flips until he lands on zero. What are the odds the man will never stop flipping?\nAfter some tedious work, I’ve developed an upper bound of 0.38907 (38.9%). My computer estimates the answer to be roughly 0.3826, but I don’t know exactly nor do I know how to calculate these odds for a different p (odds of moving forward) or n (number of spots to move up on the number line given a successful p). Any ideas would be extremely helpful.",

I can memorize and recall how to do something, but I often lack a genuine logical understanding of why and how. It might be enough to score a decent grade, but I don't have a full picture of the logic and a roundabout explanation and grasp on some things.   \n\n\nThis can be a problem for very basic and beginner level things, like doing division on paper. I know the technique, but I don't have an intuitive answer as to why this is the technique, why am I doing x and why is y happening, yada yada...\n\nMy question is, is this something that will more naturally happen the more Math I do and practice? Do I just have to keep asking potentially dumb questions in order to understand? Am I missing some fundamental knowledge? Do you personally feel like you get absolutely everything or are there things that are simply memorization?",
