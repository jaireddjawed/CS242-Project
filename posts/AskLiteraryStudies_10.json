During my (standard and not in any way language oriented) education , in our literature related classes, as part of what we call \"Croatian language course\", we read a lot of literature. We covered all the famous and important Croatian artists, and we also covered all (or most) of worldwide famous and important artists. \n\nWe've read almost all of the most important literature in the history, like Flaubert, Kafka, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Shakespeare, Chaucer... We've read modern classics (Catcher in the rye) and we've read ancient classics (Bible and Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, Divine Comedy by Dante). I never thought much about this since I've considered this the norm. After all, everyone around me, and my parents read most of these books as well.\n\nI've since moved abroad, and am now living in the Netherlands and have some close British friends as well, and well, my mind is blown! Aparently neither the Dutch, nor the British have read anything except the most important Dutch or English litterature! They don't know about Madame Bovary's cookies, they never heard about the cockroach Metamorphosis, they don't know about Karenina's train incident nor about Don Quixote's windmills!\n\nI'm curious, why is this so? Why do some countries just not care about the world's most important literature and only teach and expose their literature upon their kids? I mean, of course the Brits will learn about Chaucer and Shakespeare, but could they not also learn about the other foreign authors, that are much more important on a global literature scale? Is it only that the insignificant countries (like my own) that dwell on the global scale?\n\nCan anyone shed some light on this? Sorry if this has already been asked, I've tried (admittedly, very briefly) searching for something but did not find anything related...",

In The Problems of Dostoevsky's Poetics, Raskolnikov's speech in Crime and Punishment is used to explain this idea.\n\nBut do microdialogues need always be interior monologues?\n\nAnd does it always entail a layering of the character reproducing the speech's own personal opinions over the others speeches? (Bakhtin's example suggests that Dounia's words are layered by Raskolnikov's own of which he describes as \"ironic, indignant, precautionary\").\n\nHow might (if at all) a character's silence or speech omissions relate to microdialogues? \n\nAlso, i'd really appreciate it if anyone could pinpoint any other textual examples of microdialogues because i don't entirely understand Bakhtin's Crime and Punishment one.

Although all of her central characters come from the upper crust of English society, that social and material differences that separate bourgeois business owners from landowning peers are a major source of drama.

Across the Channel, the French equivalent to Lady Catherine de Burgh was being guillotined while comfortable bourgeois individuals like Mr. Bennett found themselves now the governing class of the French nation. Most of her novels are obliquely connected to the Napoleonic Wars, which were being fought throughout most of Austen's life in hopes of containing the revolutionary French state.\n\nWhat kind of influence could this have had on the novels Jane Austen was writing at the time? Is there any analysis of what revolutionary or counterrevolutionary themes may be present? Austen herself came from a bourgeois background. Is this relevant?",

        "author": "Priorwater",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLiteraryStudies/comments/7utq68/how_does_a_metaphor_mean_differently_than/",
        "text": "In terms of a reader’s understanding of a text, how is a metaphoric figure different from non-metaphoric (literal, referential) language? Is it actually different? \n\n---\n\nIn *Conflicting Readings: Variety and Validity in Interpretation* (1990) Paul B. Armstrong cites the “interaction theory” of metaphor (which he attributes to Max Black, Nelson Goodman, and Paul Ricoeur), which he describes thusly: \n\n&gt; …metaphors bring about semantic innovations by violating and extending the established rules of language. [The theory’s proponents] argue that metaphor cannot be regarded as an act of substitution. If a figure has indeed created a new meaning, the current lexicon will not contain an equivalent.\n\nI’m basically on board with this; to paraphrase from Wikipedia, the interaction between a metaphor’s two subject terms creates a meaning neither of the subject terms possess independently of the metaphorical context. A metaphor isn’t just flowery language, it’s a distinct and unique way to generate (establish? communicate?) meaning. \n\nArmstrong continues:\n\n&gt;Nor can the innovation be explained by arguing that the metaphor is based on a resemblance, because **the figure typically creates a comparison that had not previously seemed possible.** More often than not, a striking metaphor is powerful for the very reason that it defies our expectations. As a challenge to our customary assumptions about resemblances, the difference in a metaphor can be as important as the similarity it proposes.\n\nThis is where I’m lost. Isn’t this basically just a description of how all language works? Words are combined and the reader (with a knowledge of the established rules of a language) pulls meaning from their particular ordering. The defiance of expectation seems inherent to language. Even for incredibly literal language – “Ketchup, mustard, fried onions, sweet pickles on a brown buttered bun and fries” – there’s the surprise, or the suspense, of having an expectation for a sentence (or a phrase, or a paragraph) and seeing that expectation met or defied. We’re never *sure*, right? There’s a challenge that must be answered. Until we read something, we can’t know that our expectation is correct or incorrect: even if I’m quite sure that I’m about to read a standard description of a burger and fries, I need to read the sentence to find out. There’s still a resolution between my expectation for the text and the actual appearance of the text, even if that resolution isn’t particularly exciting. So yes, the challenge is greater for a phrase like “the atrocious innocence of a chameleon”, but to me this doesn’t seem like a different *kind* of challenge, just a more taxing one. \n\nA final example: prior to today, I had never read the phrase “subject term.” I know (or think I know) the meaning of the two terms independently (“subject” and “term”), but together they surprised me – I was challenged, and now (having thought about it and come to what seems like a reasonable definition) I believe that the phrase “subject term” has a meaning that, like Armstrong says is true of metaphors, cannot be substituted. I can refer to “two subjects,” and “two terms,” and “two subject terms,” and all three of those utterances seem to have distinct meanings – they are not interchangeable. The interaction theorist might argue that the combination of the words “subject” and “term”  ought to have “seemed possible” (whereas the metaphor \"seems impossible\") in the context of English’s rules…… but of course it seems possible now that I've read it. Previously, I had not even begun to conceive of that construction! Likewise, I can say the exact same thing for “the atrocious innocence of a chameleon\" - I had previously never conceived of it, but now of course it is possible - it's right before my eyes! \n\nWhat am I missing? Is there a metric to distinguish between text that violates ‘my understanding’ (as nearly all text does, and this is why it's possible to learn from reading) and text that violates ‘the rules of language’?\n",

        "text": "This quote by Mark Twain floats around Masonry websites. I love it and am trying to find a source. So far google searches only take me to those masonry websites who are advertising the heaters he is talking about. Where should I start my search? \n\nMark Twain On Masonry Heater\n\"Take the German stove, for instance - where can you find it outside of German countries? I am sure I have never seen it where German was not the language of the region. Yet it is by long odds the best stove and the most convenient and economical that has yet been invented.\n\nTo the uninstructed stranger it promises nothing; but he will soon find that it is a masterly performer, for all that. It has a little bit of a door which you couldn't get your head in - a door which seems foolishly out of proportion to the rest of the edifice; yet the door is right, for it is not necessary that bulky fuel shall enter it. Small-sized fuel is used, and marvelously little of that. The door opens into a tiny cavern which would not hold more fuel than a baby could fetch in its arms. The process of firing is quick and simple. At half past seven on a cold morning the servant brings a small basketful of slender pine sticks - say a modified armful - and puts half of these in, lights them with a match, and closes the door. They burn out in ten or twelve minutes. He then puts in the rest and locks the door, and carries off the key. The work is done. He will not come again until next morning.\n\nAll day long and until past midnight all parts of the room will be delightfully warm and comfortable, and there will be no headaches and no sense of closeness or oppression. In an American room, whether heated by steam, hot water, or open fires, the neighborhood of the register or the fireplace is warmest - the heat is not equally diffused throughout the room; but in a German room one is comfortable in one part of it as in another. Nothing is gained or lost by being near the stove. Its surface is not hot; you can put your hand on it anywhere and not get burnt.\n\nConsider these things. One firing is enough for the day; the cost is next to nothing; the heat produced is the same all day, instead of too hot and too cold by turns; one may absorb himself in his business in peace; he does not need to feel any anxieties of solicitudes about the fire; his whole day is a realized dream of bodily comfort.\n\nAmerica could adopt this stove, but does America do it? The American wood stove, of whatsoever breed, it is a terror. There can be no tranquility of mind where it is. It requires more attention than a baby. It has to be fed every little while, it has to be watched all the time; and for all reward you are roasted half your time and frozen the other half. It warms no part of the room but its own part; it breeds headaches and suffocation, and makes one's skin feel dry and feverish; and when your wood bill comes in you think you have been supporting a volcano.\n\nWe have in America many and many a breed of coal stoves, also - fiendish things, everyone of them. The base burners are heady and require but little attention; but none of them, of whatsoever kind, distributes its heat uniformly through the room, or keeps it at an unvarying temperature, or fails to take the life out of the atmosphere and leave it stuffy and smothery and stupefying.\"\n\n",

In a sense, it's a form of therapy.\n\nHowever, I seem to have missed reading poetry, short stories, novels, essays, what have you, on a certain topic: the woman's experience of beauty. So would you happen to have any favorite texts by female writers on feeling beautiful, going through beauty rituals, or having an anxiety with their own beauty? \n\nI haven't found these themes in Dickinson, Plath, Sexton, Elizabeth Bishop, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Louise Gluck, etc., probably because I haven't completed reading their poetry. As for short stories, I am so ashamed to say that I couldn't remember specific female authors' works. I did read \"The Bell Jar\", but that isn't primarily about beauty. I probably need to read Angela Carter for this.

I'll give you the passage specifically that made me question this: \"The sight of sawdust, even pencil shavings, made him wince, his own kind being known to use it for hushing sick transmissions, and though he dieted he could still not**,** as Oedipa did**,** use honey to sweeten his coffee for like all things viscous it distressed him, recalling too poignantly what is often mixed with motor oil to ooze dishonest**ly** into gaps between piston and cylinder wall.\"\n\nTo give you reference to the types of things I am talking about, I bolded a few 'corrections' that I have made. The original text is without the bolded parts. \n\n In some instances the oddity makes sense, like in Gravity's Rainbow. Though in other's it doesn't.

        "text": "Before we start -- don't worry, not a homework question!\n\nI have some experience in Victorian or Georgian literature, having read maybe two dozen novels or major essays from the 19th century. However, I'm really not able to identify what features make the typical novel of 1895 distinct from one published 30, 50, or 80 years earlier.\n\nFrom what I understand, the later 18th century were an incredibly turbulent time for the history of the novel. Features now incredibly normal today, like the omniscient narrator, internal monologue, morally ambiguity, and the presence of multiple narrative points of view were still being shaped and tested. But by 1815 or thereabouts, all these features were present. In fact, after this period I really can't tell what new textual innovations appeared in the novel.\n\nMaybe I'm just ignorant, but it seems like every Victorian novel basically reads same. Aesthetic differences are minimal between the early and late 19th century. While I think novels get increasingly long and essay-ridden until around 1875, and after this point dialogue became a little more vernacular and narration a little less dense, as far as I can tell the only big changes to the 19th novel involved content rather than form. Instead of finding new ways to express a linear story, writers in the first half of the century worked on emphasizing emotion, and in the latter half focused on previously neglected subjects such as \"unchaste\" women or colonized people, or delved into more complicated and ambiguous themes. \n\nBy contrast, the early 20th century brought huge formal and aesthetic changes. American writers like Hemingway obviously rejected the verbose narration and digression to the essay that characterized many Victorian novels. Other writers experimented with linearity, stream-of-consciousness, and the narrative structure itself, leading to what I think was the greatest exploration of the novelic form since the days of Samuel Richardson and Eliza Haywood. It seems that the medium of the novel experienced almost no transformations across the 19th century, then exploded with innovation in every decade of the 20th.\n\nWhat's going on here? Were there major stylistic changes during the Victorian period that I can't notice? I don't mean to suggest that Victorian literature is stagnant, or that Victorian changes to theme and content were not revolutionary, but I find it weird that there was apparently so little change to the novelic form in such an important decade. \n\nIn classical music and classical painting, very major formal and aesthetic changes separate the early, middle, and late 19th century. New techniques gave 19th century artists a wider toolset to execute their creative vision. Why isn't this true of the novel? Does the answer have to do with Victorian society and the culture of writing, or with the nature of literature as a medium?",

I've read a few introductory books on theory in addition to some theory, so it isn't that I haven't had some exposure to the gamut. But what I've seen so far honestly reads like rather pointless searches for themes that often seem like tenuous stretches. (Yeah, I know, Barthes. Still...) To be perfectly frank -- to the extent that I've been exposed, the whole practice seems more masturbatory than anything else, especially not revealing.\n\nThat can't *possibly* be true though. If theory actually had no clothes, thousands of people certainly wouldn't devote portions of their careers to the study and production of it. That's unthinkable. Rather, the problem must be internal: I'm just not \"getting\" it. Well, I want very much to \"get\" it. It seems to me that the best way of doing that is to read a *really good piece* of theory, and maybe that will make it click for me.\n\nSo please, pile on the recommendations.

        "text": "For instance, I will probably never read *War and Peace*; I'm just not that interested in it. But it's an undeniably important book and I'm less for not even being familiar with it; cultural references to it undoubtedly pass me by, and for all I know it may have been the first appearance of particular thematic elements or tropes in literature. And heck, the Western canon is just too big for any single individual to read the whole of it personally.\n\nEDIT: To be clear\n\n1) I'm a layperson, so not to worry, I won't be sacrificing my professional maturity.\n\n2) I'm only asking about works I'm not that interested in -- I read plenty first-hand, probably more than most who don't make it a living. I have to imagine that there's literature that bores even those in the field.",

I earned my BA in Speech Communication as well.\n\nI have a good idea on my specific research interests, such as religion, mental illness, gender and sexuality, performance studies, and popular culture. Additionally, I have a predilection towards 20th century American literature, comics/graphic novels, contemporary American literature, and the modern in Anglo-American literature. \n\nMy undergraduate work tends to tie media texts with literature, so I also am into 20th century advertising, music, TV and film.\n\nI know this is quite broad, and I intend to narrow these further as I go along.\n\nWhat I'd like to ask is this: which universities have a strong inclination towards these topics? I'm considering continuing my MA if there's funding. If not, I want to take note of English Departments for a Ph.D. in the future.\n\nThank you, and I appreciate your help!",
