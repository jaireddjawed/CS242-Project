        "text": "I realize that most people have sexual thoughts about people other than their partners. However, from what I’ve heard/read, men generally seem to have these thoughts frequently when they’re out and about in their day to day life. My boyfriend of six months has confirmed that he also sometimes has thoughts of this nature. He says that he prefers not to and chooses not to stare at attractive strangers or think disrespectfully. \n\nFor some reason, I can’t handle this idea very well. It’s not that I’m worried he’s going to cheat on me - I’m not. It’s specifically an issue with the thoughts themselves. It makes me feel like other women have power in regards to him/our relationship that they don’t have the right to/I don’t want them to have. It brings up years of feelings of inferiority and insecurity in me. When I’m single, in a way I feel powerful and at peace, because I know that many men both taken and single have thoughts about me, but in a relationship I feel powerless because I cannot command the sexual attention of the only man whom I desire the attention of. There’s probably more to it as well. Maybe it’s very immature thinking that’s leading me to have these feelings. I don’t mind if that’s the case - I’m just trying to get to the bottom of it. \n\nI’d like to clarify that I’m not being hypocritical. I don’t think about other men in a sexual way. \n\nHonestly, thinking about this today got me so upset that I considered breaking us up. Of course that would probably be a mistake. He is truly the man of my dreams, apart from this very human habit. I feel that I’ve found a unicorn, and I’d be unlikely to find a guy like him again if we did break up and I eventually got over this hangup. He told me that he would fight these thoughts, and I told him that I would try not to think about them any more and that I wouldn’t ask him about them either. Is that the right decision on my end? I’m concerned that it won’t be enough to keep my mind at peace.\n\nTL;DR - I feel disproportionately negative emotions when I think about the fact that my boyfriend at least occasionally has dirty thoughts about other women. I feel that I would regret breaking up with him and choosing a life of celibacy, so how do I handle these feelings in a constructive way? Is trying not to worry about his thoughts enough?",

        "text": " \n\nMy sister lives in the west coast and I live in the east coast. I offered to let my sister live with me because her grades were really bad from lack of discipline/attention at home, not realizing what I was signing up for. I've been helping her with schoolwork for the last few months, but it basically boiled down to me doing all of her schoolwork for her every day and parenting her over the phone because she wouldn't listen to anyone else in our family.\n\nMy feelings really shifted after she yelled at me when I asked her to explain what she learned in one of her classes. She said \"Why do I have to explain it to you? I already did the school work in class?! I don't want to do it!\" and I said \"you failed all of your tests last semester. You got Fs in everything, so I need to make sure you understand what you were taught in class.\" This was after I wrote many essays for her, gave her answers to so many assignments she didn't turn in, and helped her cram all night for a test she failed to mention until a day before. I had to reteach everything her teachers taught her AND do her homework for her on top of all of my responsibilities. It was really stressing me out because I had just moved across the country alone when I've never lived on my own before, I had my first mortgage, car payments, quarterly taxes (I'm self employed), tech issues (related to my work), declining health (I had an injury last year I'm still recovering from, plus weight issues), and I struggled all my life with anxiety around doing everyday things (which is why it took so long for me to move out on my own).\n\nThat incident where the student nearly beat a teacher to death in Florida happened at the high school my sister is supposed to enroll in, so I told my mom (we have different moms) that she may not be safe because of how poorly the staff and police handled that situation. My mom says to let my sister decide because she wants me to take care of my sister.\n\nThe school in my sister's area has never had a violent incident like that occur, so I know she'll be fine since our other sister graduated from there. My sister will probably still choose to live with me anyway, but besides my personal feelings, I'm not sure if we should let her go to a school where the staff watched a woman get her skull bashed in before trying to do anything and the police just let the attacker walk off. There's another school in the same country about 20 mins away, but the ratings for that school are worse.\n\nHonestly, reteaching my sister everything and doing her homework for her over the next 4 years while trying to get her to sleep and wake up on time, practice basic hygiene, buy her whatever she needs, limit her social media/gaming time, cook for her, drive her wherever she needs to go, get her to exercise, emotionally support her, etc might not be something I can handle since I can barely do it for myself. When I offered to take her in, I thought I'd just figure it out and be okay with taking care of someone else's child because I'm childless. I thought I'd be okay with dying alone without ever getting married or having children of my own, but now that I've had more time to consider it, I'm not so sure. If I decide to have kids, I'd rather do it sooner than later to mitigate any risks that come with having children at a later age.\n\nI'm on the fence since my sister has shown improvement and it would be good to see her become a happier and productive person, but she has parents, a grandmother, grandfather, aunts, uncles, older sister and brother at home, but yet they can't handle her so they think it doesn't matter if I focus on her instead of figuring out if I want to get married and have kids while I'm still healthy and able to. I realize it was my idea to offer to let her live with me in the first place, but I didn't think too deeply about the situation before making a decision and I kind of regret acting so hastily and being so short sighted.\n\nOn the other hand, I don't expect to meet a guy any time soon because I want to lose weight first/improve my appearance and get my life together, so a year with her might be fine. I don't know what to do.\n\nTLDR: I offered to let my sister move with me across the country, not realizing how much responsibility taking care of someone else's child would be; the school she's supposed to enroll it was on the news recently for an attack on a teacher, and I'm not sure what to do because I'm a mess.",

        "text": "\nFor context, we’ve lived together for 2 years now and dated since we were teenagers. He’s had depression for a while, but it was mostly manageable. \nBut things have been very bad since his best friend (who was like a brother to him and he knew his entire life) died in a car accident 5 months ago. He’s tried to hold it together whenever I’m around for my sake and still hangs out with me and tries to make it seem like nothings changed and that he’s fine, but I can tell he’s low on energy. Aside from doing work and other necessities, he basically just lays in bed whenever I’m not around. Lost interests in his hobbies. I can sometimes hear him crying when the door to our room is closed and he thinks I’m not listening. He’s been seeing a therapist, but the results have been limited.\n\nWell. Recently I found out he’s watching these weird ASMR RP (role play) videos on YouTube. It’s weird and I don’t fully understand it, but basically a YouTuber talks in an RP pretending to be the girlfriend of the viewers in different RP situations and sometimes comforts viewers. At least that’s how he described it. \n\nThey seemed to mostly be targeted for single people though. So I didn’t understand why if he needed that type of comfort he didn’t ask me to provide it to him and instead secretly did this. And when I asked him he told me “I don’t want to bring your mental health down with mine. I don’t want to risk ruining our relationship by being a constant drain. This gives comfort and peace, and numbs the pain without having to lean on you and making you take care of me. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you, I should have. But I don’t want to worry or burden you. I want you to enjoy our relationship. Not hate it”.\n\nI don’t know how I should feel. Is this considered unfaithful? Or am I not doing enough that he feels the need to turn to these? Is it wrong for him to listen to these while dating? \nI’m thankful he’s being considerate of my mental health and doesn’t want to be demanding but it also feels like he either doesn’t think I’m enough to help him, maybe isn’t faithful, or I just am actually failing as a girlfriend. Or am I just overthinking everything? \n\n\nTLDR: BF listens to these weird girlfriend RP videos on YouTube, I can’t tell if he’s doing something wrong, I’m doing something wrong, or if I’m just overthinking nothing.",

        "text": "My boyfriend and I have been together for 2 years. We have our flaws and we both are trying to work towards being better humans and being better for each other. We've had our ups and downs in the relationship, but we are happy together. A few months ago, we got into our biggest argument, which a lot of it could have been avoided if I had less of a negative attitude and if he was willing to control his emotions and give me the space I needed. Instead, things escalated - he screamed at me and he laid his hands on me. I immediately grabbed my stuff and ran to my car so I could be alone. I called my mom, cried, and told her about what happened. My boyfriend realized what he did and recognized that he needed help with his anger and mental health and put himself into therapy immediately. He grew up in a household with two parents who were always fighting and sometimes violent, but he has said himself that he does not want to end up like them. We have a lot of forgiveness in our relationship, as long as we are able to acknowledge our mistakes and make the appropriate changes to be better. \n\nEver since that incident, my boyfriend has been actively trying to make changes in his life, including addressing his mental health. It was a wakeup call for him. Although it's only been a few months, I've noticed that he's been much calmer during our disagreements. He's more cognizant of his emotions. He gets less triggered when someone does something dumb on the road. While the situation I was in a few months ago was a very scary and emotional event, I eventually learned to forgive him after a few months of seeing the changes he has made to address his mental health and wellbeing.\n\nMy mother, on the other hand, has done a 180 on him. She never liked him since day 1. She hates him because of that one incident a few months ago. Every time I call her, all she can ever talk about is how much she hates him. Pretty sure she's done a full background check on him, but I don't see him as the type of person to have a criminal background or other red flags. I don't feel the desire to call my mom anymore because it never feels productive. She's just going to tell me that I need to leave him, he's a violent person, and he cannot be trusted. I am a strong believer that people can change, and I've seen that he's determined to work towards being a better person. I also don't believe we should define someone solely from their worst moments. My mom refuses to listen to me when I try to say good things about him or how he's doing well with therapy (she doesn't believe in therapy). She hates him so much that she can't even be in the same room as him. She's protective of me, but somehow, I feel like she is trying to control my life. I feel like I have to pick a side. I've told my boyfriend about this, but he's still willing to put up with it.\n\nThe way I'm seeing it, having a future with him means that my mom will panic every time they are around each other and they might start arguing/yelling at each other. This isn't ideal for me because I would prefer to be with someone who gets along with my family. If we break up, of course my mom is going to be overjoyed, but I don't know if I would feel the same way. In fact, I wonder if I will learn to resent my mom. But at the same time, I wonder if she her intuition and wisdom are correct and he is not safe to be around, considering she usually has a good track record for reading people.\n\ntldr: Boyfriend and I got into an ugly argument that led to him laying his hands on me. Cried to my mom about it and now, anytime I call my mom, she repeats herself about how much he hated him since day 1 and tells me to break up with him. He recognized his mistake and is now in therapy to help him manage his emotion and mental health.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this situation?  Do you think my mom is overreacting?  Or do you think mothers are almost always right and I should follow her intuition?  If I keep this relationship going (eventually marriage), will my boyfriend and mother ever learn to be civil around each other?  Do you believe that people can change for the better?  Does one \"somewhat violent\" incident make you concerned about domestic abuse in the future?",

        "text": "Long time reader. Infrequent poster. Not entirely sure if my post is focused on advice or just to get it written down for self reflection later.\n\nI’ve [30M] been in a relationship with a gal [31F] for almost 6 years. And I’ve felt the desire to be out of the relationship for the last 3 years. More or less aligned with COVID and spending more time together in her condo.\n\nFor some reason I can’t explain but can somewhat reason through, I can’t find myself able to exit the relationship. Some core issues with our current situation\n-\tShe owns a 2BR condo and I have an apartment around 15 miles away\n-\tShe has a spending problem. She doesn’t understand the concept of savings. Any money left over from her paycheck goes right into clothes. Probably $30k in credit card debt and maybe $500 in her checking at any given point. Rich-poor. Makes a ton of money. Spends more.\n-\tRelated to the spending issue, she has **a lot** of stuff. We doesn’t want me to move in primarily since she’s not interested in figuring out the space question\n-\tI’ve over her condo a minimum of 5 nights / week. Typically 6 nights. I bring a duffel to live out of. Around the size of a carry on. Since I can only bring so much, I find my *quality* of life diminished. I don’t wear my nice clothes anymore, I only bring a pair of sneakers, I don’t feel like bringing all my shaving stuff, etc.\n-\tThe expectation is I pay for everything. Vacations, take out, random thing at the store she wants.\n-\tShe has 2 dogs from before our relationship. I’m in charge of walking, feeding and taking care of the misc items like brushing, bathing and medicine\n-\tIf we’re not spending time on something she’s interested in, she’s sulking somewhere in the apartment. Read a book? Nope. Boring. Only watch TV shows she likes, etc.\n\nAnd finally: **Communication is non-existent**. She has no interest in what I have to say if its not interesting to her. No yelling. No fighting. Just silent treatment if something that comes out of my mouth doesn’t work for her. And short of apologizing or waiting a few hours, there’s not much to do to get out of that state.\n\nThere’s a bunch I’m leaving out. Specifically the fun we have together. When she’s at her best, things are wonderful. She works decently high up in her company and would be considered a top tier operator.\n\nBut the day to day is rough. My typical feeling is that I’m a caretaker for a child. \n\nGiven I have my own apartment, we haven’t commingled our finances and that I’m clearly unhappy, I have no idea why I continue to stay. I know things could and should be better. I know that this has to be some level of emotional manipulation and/or I need to work through stuff. I don’t expect to be able to work things out with her.\n\nBut there’s this deep frustration that I know I’ll never get closure. She won’t even tolerate a conversation about ordering take out less. Having an adult conversation about what I need in the relationship? Or explaining that I’m unhappy? Fuck no. She won’t care. She’ll shut down and just open Instagram in silence.\n\nI’ve told myself I’ll just leave tomorrow and not look back. But here I am typing this on a couch in her condo as she scrolls TikTok for the 3rd hour today.\n\nTLDR: Stuck in a relationship with chains of my own making.",

        "text": "Hello,\n\nI have a friend who is currently in a very abusive relationship who is many states away from me. She is 25 years old, and her husband is around the same age. They live in a 2 bedroom home, with their one year old daughter. They actually have three children, two of which live with her aunt due to reasons. They’ve been married six years. In that time, both partners separated on several occasions and ultimately got back together. Reasons being, the husband is an abusive, manipulative sociopath who has no desire to contribute to the relationship, aside from causing psychological harm. She has been the victim of constant beratement, which has done both mental, emotional damage and on a few occasions, escalated to physical altercations. Between the two of them, the responsibilities of parenting, living expenses and general upkeep of their rental mostly lie with her. She has a remote job that has allowed her to spend most of her time at home, juggling between being an attentive parent, working and maintaining the house. He does not actively participate in these things, and really only when absolutely necessary. She has shown restraint and has held her tongue and maintained composure through all of this.\n\nHer current situation is a vile one. The abuse she has endured has taken its toll on her overall wellbeing. Unfortunately, she has very little support from her family, who has been fed lies from the husband, painting her as the bad guy. Quite the contrary. She has recorded evidence of these abuses, which range from text messages between her and her husband, as well as video of him screaming and yelling at her. She has shared this with the only real family she has, her aunt, who sadly champions her husband more than her, leaving her with no real escape. Yes, despite being presented with actual proof that her own flesh and blood is being sadistically bullied, she doesn't care.\n\nThe husband has threatened suicide should she take any drastic actions, such as moving out on her own with her child, who is far safer in her hands than his.  He is constantly monitoring her every move, eavesdropping on calls, catching glimpses of her texts and more.\n\nThe situation gets more complicated. Her aunt has her two other children permanently, and has been visiting the two of them on the regular. However, our friend has made her aunt aware of her plans to leave the situation, get her own place and leave him to figure things out on his own. The aunt was vehemently disapproving and told her that if she followed through with her plan, she would cut her children off from her, barring any visits or seeing them again. The same holds true for the one daughter they do have with them. Her husband and aunt would make it impossible to see her again.\n\nTL;DR: A friend of mine is in a seemingly inescapable abusive relationship with her husband. Children are involved. Suicide and physical violence have been threatened should she take any action. Texts and videos have been recorded. No immediate family support. Feels stuck.\n\nAny and all advice is welcome and very much appreciated.\n\nThank you for reading!",

I am having a good time doing so to the extend that I feel like I'm genuinely improving myself. \n\nAs a result, I think I'm starting to realise I want to stay more, even though I promised my beloved lady to come back after the months. My girlfriend has been very supportive in me going on this journey even though it is obvious that she is really bumped that I will be away for so long. \n\nI have invited her to come along and offered to adjust the travel plans in order to be able to go to destinations that she likes as I am not very selective with these things as long as their new and exciting. It would be great to travel together and explore all these things together. \n\nInstead she has planned in an extra work project and bought new furniture for her apartment, even though she also had plenty of funds before that to go on a journey with me. As a matter of fact, she has much more income than me due to her family and awesome project based career.\n\nThis was a bit disappointing for me as in my mind going on such a journey together is pretty much the best thing we could do. We did manage however to make her come over for 10 days wich is great but I was thinking about a journey that is much much longer.\n\nI have always expressed to her that living in different countries, exploring different cultures and improving my proficiency in different languages is my greatest passion and that it is my intention to pursue that for the next few years. She has always said that it's what she loves about me because she really wants to experience these things too.\n\nI get this gut feeling that when push comes to shove, she wouldnt really commit to a long and faraway trip or move to another country for that matyer. She has never said that this is the case, rather the opposite. Yet, this intuitive feeling does remain. \n\nI have addressed this feeling with her, saying that I am concerned whether our values are aligned in this way and she assured me that she really looks forward to planning our next trip together as well as looking into the matter of moving abroad?\n\nIn the end of the day, I promised her to be back after the two months but I feel like that is not what I want. I also have doubts if she is willing to commit to doing such things together at all! I am not sure what I should do at this point. Am I just being impatient? Or should I just stay longer and see what comes out of that? \n\nDear Redditors, my apologies for the long post. Would you pleasw be able to give me some advice on this matter? I'm not sure what to do anymore.\n\nTL;DR: I'm staying abroad to explore &amp; improve. I promised my girlfriend to come back after 2 months, but am starting to realise that I want to stay more. I want to go abroad a lot more often as well and she says that she does too but yet I get a gut feeling that she wouldnt when push comes to shove. How should I go at this?",

        "text": "\nJealous about wife’s past?\n\nMe and my now wife have been married two years and together for 6. I knew about her past(she told me everything) when we first started dating. She’s had sex with 8 guys and done plenty of other stuff with others. Of the eight, 1 was a neighbor down the road from her house. He moved out then another boy (#2) moved in and she began having sex with him. Boy 1 and 2 were friends and boy 1 basically “passed” her on to number 2. She was in 8th grade when she was having sex with boy 1 and he was in 10th. Boy 2 she had sex with him down a path in the woods and then in her car when she started driving. She had sex multiple times with boy 1, 2, 6, and 7. The #3 guy she had sex with she says it was a one time thing but she still had feelings for him. Somehow her best friend started talking to guy 3 and my wife drove her over to his house to “hang out” her words. Her best friend and boy 3 began having sex and boy 3’s cousin (boy 4) was also at the home and supposedly asked her “what you trying to do” and she stated in her own words to me “I was mad she was having sex with a guy I liked so to get back to him I had sex with his cousin”. I will admit I was shocked and she could tell what I was thinking, but I let it go. Fast forward a few months me and my wife are having problems(I was flirting with other girls, being a not good boyfriend basically. Not only do I find out she is taking screenshots of me and her conversations(personal stuff) and sending them to boy 2, but she is doing it while I’m still typing and telling him that I am tripping. She then invited boy 2 to come over to her house. She swears nothing would’ve happened but we both know the truth in that. The same day I find out she is asking MY cousin to hang out and smoke, then she tells him to delete the conversation. So I’m basically having deja vu with bou 3 and 4 at this point. Boy 5(sorry this isn’t in order) was 18 and she was 14 when she snuck him into her room and they had sex. Then a year later she snuck him in again, she only performed oral on him before getting caught by her mom. Police were called and the guy was arrested. Boy 6 was her first, she was 13 and they were boyfriend girlfriend. He took her virginity in a deer stand. They had sex twice before he broke it off. Boy 7 was a “fling” as in it was a boy she went to school with and she would drive to his house, pick him up, and have sex down a dirt road. Boy 8 she says she took her friend to have sex with someone and he was there and also asked her “what you trying to do” and they had sex.  As I said we’ve been married 2 years and together for 6. When she first told me about all the guys she’s been with I lied and told her I’ve had sex multiple times(I was a virgin).  I just told her the truth about this about a week ago and obviously she wasn’t happy.  My question is, how can I stop these thoughts before they ruin our marriage? I also keep thinking about the fact I wasn’t having sex with multiple people before I met her. I’m not trying to praise myself for being a virgin, but I hate myself for not taking the multiple opportunities I had to have sex. I have never thought of sex as just sex, I’ve always thought it was meant to be with someone you love. \n\nTL;DR JEALOUS ABOUT MY WIFES PAST AS I WILL ONLY HAVE SEX WITH HER IN MY LIFE.",

I often go to her for advice, I trust her opinion more than most, and it was a deal breaker for a lot of past relationships if they didn't get along with my mom. She worked at a school as a teaching assistance growing up for 15 years until she got hurt when a student jumped on her back during recess. She retired afterwards. \n\nMy partner (referred to as X) is a high school teacher. He works his ass off constantly to be the best teacher they can. I've seen them work themselves into exhaustion with the work they take home, but they love teaching. X's passion to help kids is one of the things I admire the most about them. I on the other hand have never had a passion for work. I work a 9 to 5 that I care very little about, but it offers good pay, plenty of time off, and great benefits.\n\nA few days ago, my mother watched an episode of Jeopardy where one of the contestants was a teacher. Following the episode my mom posted on social media \"OMG this teacher had the worst answers on Jeopardy. These are the people teaching our children. Everything makes so much sense to me now\". Once I saw it, I was immediately appalled. She, X, and I ended up getting into it over social media. A lot of messages were exchanged, but the key points were that while X was an amazing teacher it didn't change the fact that \"good teachers are few and far between\". At the end of it all, she said \"she [My mom] can have her opinion and I can have mine and that being an adult means to understand this\".\n\nI was livid.\n\nToday, after not talking with my mom since then, I texted her saying that she should apologize to my X. That even if she didn't intend to hurt X, she did with her comments. She and I got into it again, with my mom just constantly repeating that this was just her opinion and that it isn't her [my mom] fault if X got offended by what she said. That this was a free country and she [my mom] can have whatever opinion she wants. I didn't know how to respond, so we just said good night and ended the conversation.\n\nI still do not know what to do. I love X passion for teaching. I do not think X will let this go and move on, and I don't want him to. However, I also don't think my mom will ever apologize.  I am extremely disappointed in her and can't see a way to move past this.\n\n#TL;DR\n\nMy mom insulted my partners profession on social media and refuses to apologize. I told her she should apologize and she doubled down. I am extremely disappointed in her attitude and how she handled everything.",

She was an old Russian woman, and obviously had different teaching methods than those trained in the US. Us girls were pitted against each other on things like looks, weight, and of course, who was the strongest gymnast. Natasha would shout insults at me and humiliate me in front of everyone (one time she asked the team to get into a circle around me and asked me to tell my weight number to everyone, and tell everyone why I became \"plump\") Looking at old pictures, I was actually underweight. Natasha was the one who taught me how to throw up using a spoon in my throat, and one time didn't let me out of the bathroom until I got rid of a rice krispy she saw me eat).\n\nMy sister, on the other hand, was the \"Maddie Ziegler\" of the gym. Natasha had a soft spot for her, she was praised a lot. She regularly won her age group at regional competitions, and did hoop routines really well (if you ever did rg, you would know how hard hoop is). I remember Natasha telling me that I CAN be like my sister, if I just work hard, etc. Nobody was there to tell me that I didn't need to be like my sister, I was good enough. Despite all I went through at that gym, I worked as hard as I could, but it was all wasted.\n\nWhen I was 12, my sister got an offer from another gym, a highly prestigious one, 2 hours away from where we lived. My mom, without even giving me notice that we were quitting, signed both my sister and I out of my original gym, and only my sister continued gymnastics at the new one. After all my hard work, I never got closure. My mom could have at least told me the day before that we were leaving, but decided not to.\n\nAnd to make it worse, she didn't trust me to say home alone, so every day after school, I would ride with my mom and sister to this new gym, sit in the car for 3 hours while my sister trained, then ride back. We could often come home past 11. Maybe I would be ok with it if my mom and I were somewhat close, but we weren't. On the ride to the gym, she would turn on the radio really loud even though I get sensory overload because I'm on the spectrum.\n\nParked in a car near the gym, she would scream at me to do my homework. She has beaten me into compliance multiple times before. She had threatened to kick me out when I turned 16 (obviously my dad didn't let that happen).

I asked her if she ever regretted what she did, but she just said she was doing what's best for her kids.\n\nTl;dr: How could I forgive someone who hasn't even apologized?",

        "text": "\\[cross posted on relationships\\_advice\\]\n\nHey all! I (25F) go to school with my ex-boyfriend (25M) and we see each other in class 2x per week. We were friends and shared a social circle before we dated for 5 months. 3 of those months were long distance. I was blindsided - he seemed smitten until the very last weeks.\n\nAfter the breakup, I avoided him. Our social circle divided, so we had no reason to talk. However, we got stuck on transit often, and he made  weird comments. He told me about things that reminded him of me, e.g. cat videos, academic papers, etc. He also initiated deep topics, like family matters and his friends' personal issues, when I kept things light.\n\nThis was tolerable until  January. He told me he wanted to give me a book. I was surprised, and he  added that he'd like it back. Brought it to class the next day. It was short and v personalized to my taste, so I read it quickly and texted that it was a great rec. Surprise surprise... he left me on unread.\n\nHe later asked for it back, and \"forgot\" he asked. I waited on campus and had to text him to find out he forgot the request that I bring it to  school.\n\nI made a bigger effort to avoid him. 2 months later, we have a ride together. We catch up as  classmates, although he brings up his friends' issues again. In the last 30 seconds, I compliment his painted nails. I note that he'd always  wanted that. Avoiding eye contact, he thanks me, hesitates, and says calmly and smoothly, \"Actually I've been seeing someone recently and they painted them for me.\"\n\nI am surprised, but compliment his nails again, and he gets off at his stop. Still no eye contact. I'm left wondering what just happened. Do you think this was innocuous? I doubt I would have found out otherwise. I don't have social media, and he is not open about his dating life... took him 3 months of dating to tell me (without alcohol) about his only ex.\n\nTL;DR my ex told me that he's dating someone when I expressed no interest in finding out.",

        "text": "me (18m) and my (17f) gf met each other at a mutual friends house around 7 months ago and hit right off the bat. we became official roughly 3 months ago so this is more of a new relationship. we got extremely close and have even had sleepovers, spent the whole day at each others houses, even go out or see each other almost everyday. we were doing that since before we were official. obviously becoming official opened the door to more things, but i choose not to speak on that for our privacy. so march comes which is our 3rd month being together and her parents found out she wasn’t doing the best in school. so now she’s grounded, no phone at night, no going out, her mom is taking her to school and taking her home. there is no way i can hang out with her and it’s killing me. she’s gotten grounded before and we would usually find slips in between, i would pick her up from school and take her home, i would bring her lunch during her break at work, or drop her off at home from work. but her mom said no more rides from anyone, that she has to call them for a ride, and it might be my own conscious going into a dark place but i feel like lately she’s slowly been getting distant, and i just want it to work. i know everyone says to talk about it, speak your mind, etc., and i understand that’s the truth, i have to communicate to know how she’s really feeling. it’s just sometimes she gives me random reassurance like telling me how grateful she is to have me, or how much i’ve helped her with her life. (she’s been through a lot of personal issues since we’ve gotten together, and i’ve been trying to help anyway i can. as far as letting her use my personal financial accounts, me coming in bad weather just to check on her house outside and etc.) i don’t have any doubt of her love and i do feel like she loves me. i do feel like she cares about me and wants me to be with her, she sometimes just doesn’t show it. now since she’s grounded i can’t text her after a certain time, i can’t see her anymore, and from going out almost daily to not going out cold turkey really had a negative impact on me. we both love each other’s company and have even shared that if we were able to we would want to be around each other all hours of the day. now i understand my relationship is new and we can be in a honeymoon phase or whatnot, but i’m just starting to get a little worried with the fact that there isn’t a date where i will be able to see her again. a previous time that i always think about is when we were going to go out and her mom started asking her who she was going out with, she told me she was too nervous and scared to tell her she’s dating a boy. since she didn’t want to tell her, she had to cancel our date, which really bummed me out. she’s introduced me to her brother, her friends, and she’s told a few of her family members about me. she gives me constant reassurance that she wants me in her life and tells me she really wants me to meet her parents but doesn’t know how bring it up. her mom knows of me, she knows i’m someone who’s been to her high school sports games and she knows i’ve even given her gifts, but my girlfriend is scared to tell her that i’m her boyfriend even though her mom already has an idea. a good amount of my family knows about her, my brother has met her, and my uncle has met her. i guess what im really asking for is a listening ear\n\ni know this is all over the place and i would like to continue talking about this with you guys\n\nTl;DR:\ni really just wanted to vent, to get things off my chest that’s really been in my head lately. i don’t really have anyone to talk to anymore besides family members, but when it comes to talking about personal issues with family members it’s uncomfortable and it’s not normal for us to. i would love to hear feedback, and maybe some advice with the situation of her being grounded and me not being able to see her or text her after a certain time after seeing her daily for months and texting her from morning til night. and her constantly getting around her mom questioning if she has a boyfriend or not.\n\ni don’t want to speak too much about us since this is a throwaway and i don’t want anyone i know finding out but i can answer more questions you guys have the best i can\n\nand recently my mental health hasn’t been the best i’ve been feeling pretty tired of everything, i’m starting to have issues with some family members and my depression is coming back. but i don’t believe in breaks, i believe i can work things out with balance, just having trouble finding it.",

        "text": "tl;dr My close friend of four years contacted me again and was nice for a couple of days, asked me if I was traveling to her part of the world this year and then ghosted me again\n\nHi all,\n\nI had a huge fight with someone I thought was my close close friend. It's been about 7 months since our fight, and she said she wasn't ready to talk about it the times I tried to reach out, so I didn't press, but I sent a text to ask how she is once a week and get a totally cold reply (or no reply). The thing is, I know I acted poorly, I felt like a doormat and neglected in this friendship for a very long time and lost my shit - which takes a lot for me to be pushed to doing\n\nSo, basically, the summary as I wrote a long article and even I was bored reading my words (this is long but the other was a novel):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Friend and I met on tinder almost 4 years ago, I was separated at the time, and she didn't seem into me romantically because of this, so I never pursued it.\n* Over the course of time, we became extremely close (I thought) and agreed to have the relationship where we shared secrets that we couldn't tell others. (i.e. the reason I was separated was my wife had a long affair with a friend and I couldn't handle it)\n* My friend told me her Mom spoke to her and was worried about her being close to me due to my marital situation back then, so I totally backed off\n* My friend has lots of random guys she hooks up with, but always said she doesn't like the emotions involved in a relationship, so she prefers brief relationships\n* She and I used to send lots of selfies to each other to stay close, as we do not get to see each other due to the pandemic\n* It started to be where she would disappear mid conversation, and come back hours later to say goodnight or chat a bit before she slept.\n* I got into a car accident on new years eve and sent her a text saying I couldn't call her because of this and she didn't really talk for a few days as she felt I brought bad luck by telling her about my car accident on new year, I had to ask and drag it out of her, as I wasn't sure what I'd done wrong.\n* Over the last year, she had gotten mad at me and not talked to me for a week or so a few times before saying she realized she overreacted. I always texted asking what was wrong, and a couple times she said nothing, but one time she sent me a long angry text about all the things wrong I've done and how it made her want to kill herself, because I wrote her a message trying to explain why I sometimes seemed off (I had realized early on I had some jealousy, and had gotten past. it, so wanted to explain why I had reacted or acted poorly sometimes, even though it was in the past, as I had realized it with some self reflection, I just wanted to apologize. I felt awful about upsetting her). Some of them I hadn't realized, but I felt so badly about this message as I thought I was doing the right thing owning up to my shortcomings.\n* She was cranky with me a lot earlier last year, and I spoke up about it, and we were ok for a few months. (Like I used to send flowers when I thought she needed cheering up, and one time the delivery guy woke her, even tho I specified deliver at night, and she was so cold, just a thank you, but it was a cold one)\n* She had been withdrawing more and more, but still telling me I was the most important one to her, and she loved me and called me sexy and hot a lot, but stopped really confiding in me, but always wanted me to be there whenever she was going to sleep as she liked to chat a bit then each day. I noticed I was getting cranky and short with her, and I tried to adjust myself, as we are just friends. I hated I got that way.\n* She hadn't been sending pics at all really, so I pathetically asked for one on my birthday, and she didn't send for almost a week, but she was sending tons to other guys (which is fine. I am not bothered by guys, just, I guess I wanted to feel special on my day. I. know, I know.)\n* I found she hid a two year sexting relationship with a married man, and I was upset because of the hiding/lie (and honestly, she led me to believe we weren’t intimate because I was separated), but I thought we were good as we had a long talk after and just everything seemed great. The man was also the same ethnicity as the married man my wife cheated with, with just sort of hurt deeply, reopening that wound. I really wouldn't have cared, just hated being lied to again.\n* After swallowing the lie about the married dude… I have some trauma around people from a certain country, as my father used to lie and take trips with women from this country - but always said he was seeing friends. My friend had said she didn't like them either, so I reacted weirdly when she said she was talking intense and sexual with someone form there on tinder. I regretted my reaction and apologized. She told me no big deal as she wasn't talking to him or seeing him anymore\n* She was planning this trip to a place she said she wanted to go with me, as it was special to her, and somewhere special to me (neither of us had visited before). Because we are apart, she recently said she was going with her other close friend, which made me happy as he is very special to her as well. It turned out she was going with the random guy she met on tinder, and the friend was joining only part of the time, and I shouldn't care as she had no feelings for him. I found out a few hours before she was leaving.\n* I totally lost my shit, which is rare, and got angry and said some hurtful things because I felt bad about the hiding/lying. I don't get that angry easily or often, so just didn't know how to deal with those emotions and said some mean things. But looking inside, I think I had been feeling neglected or ignored, and then told how special I was all the time, but the actions never matched the words. And boy am I ashamed at the things that came out of my mouth. It was out of line, and I couldn’t believe it was me saying them, it was just pure emotion.\n* She told me I made her feel totally guilty of all the things she's done the last few years, and that she didn't even want to go on the trip anymore, that I'd ruined it, she also said all she did was trigger me. I feel so devastated that my anger, and selfishness, ruined her trip and made her feel bad about herself. I never judged her lifestyle, and I never will - everyone does things their own way\n* I texted a week after saying I knew we both were hurt, and that she needed space, and I wasn't being silent to be a jerk, just trying to respect what I felt she wanted. I got a cold response of two words\n* I tried to other times to ask how she's doing and got cold response/silence, except for one time she chatted me like everything was normal in November and then ghosted me again\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Fast forward to a couple weeks back, I finally had moved on but she sent some nice warm messages, and I foolishly responded, only to have her ghost me again\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* She’s still with the guy she met last summer, I’m pretty sure - which is actually great, I always hated she jumped from man to man, always felt she deserved better (and no, I didn't think that person was me)\n\nI've been doing a lot of self analysis since then, even going back to therapy, as I just am devastated and can't sleep, or eat. I still miss her, but I understand the shitty things I said were in the wrong. I know this friendship is ruined because of me. I normally am very open and direct, but she doesn't like talking about feelings or emotions, so she asked me not to, and I did (but it all built up, I guess).\n\nAlso, I know that when I feel someone is slipping away I can grasp too tight. It’s not a good look on anyone… The thing with me is as long as people are honest with me, I don’t panic. It’s the unknown and lies that drive me a bit crazy.\n\nI should add, not that this excuses my outburst, but I had some pretty horrific abuse as child, and I know that it affects the way I am in relationships sometimes (I always want to please, but maybe this makes me toxic. I really don't know)\n\nI just don't want anyone hurt over me ever again. I know I can be weird, and I guess I wanted more than I deserved with my friend, I guess since my wife had hid so much and was never sexual with me… I wanted someone at least who confided in me.\n\nReally... why would someone reach out and act friendly for a few days, ask me if I am coming that way this year... and then when I reply nicely, ghost me and leave me on read again? I don't understand what I did wrong.",

        "text": "TLDR: I think friend and I are both attracted to each other, debating asking to hookup or not\n\nI haven't posted on here ever, nor on reddit in the last while. Regardless, I'm in a kind of weird position suddenly and could use some advice.\n\nBasically. I broke up with my boyfriend this past week, over my college spring break. It was a long time coming, although the relationship itself was like 9 months long. ANYWAYS. So, back at college, I have this friend- let's call him James because that's a very generic name. James and I met when we were both in relationships, which made me kind of ignore the behavior I otherwise would have assumed was flirting. We have a lot in common, including birthdays and appearances which means he sort of looks like my angry Russian cousin.\n\nTo add to the list of things we have in common, apparently, is that he also ended a relationship over spring break. These were not correlated events, and I actually had no idea him and his partner were having problems. Anyways, he texts me about this over break, and when we get back on campus, I invite him over to my place because I'm a curious person and needed details. He gives me the rundown, and I sort of give him mine. He then tells me he had a dream we kissed- which is just a really weird thing to tell your friend in my opinion. But admittedly, I'm like, this is a really weird coincidence again because I had a similar dream on the same night. He was just sitting there so I kind of was just like, \"I'm not going to date you,\" which is a very true statement, and I just had to get it out there. He gave an indication that he didn't mean to imply we were going to date, and then we sort of just went to the bookstore and pretended that conversation didn't happen.\n\nIt's true I don't have any interest in dating this friend, or at least pursuing any sort of traditional relationship with him, and that's frankly a really bad idea because we both just ended these other relationships. What IS true is that I've always been attracted to him, and maybe that's a narcissistic thing because we look a little alike (which is an important part of the whole problem imo) but it's true, and I can't help but want to see if he's interested in a kind of fwb situation.\n\nWhy I'm hesitant to go forward:\n\n\\- He'll say no to advances and it will make things weird\n\n\\- we hookup and it's bad\n\n\\- we hookup and it's good\n\n\\- friendship dies\n\n\\- i end up dating my evil twin\n\nThis is a really annoying situation so any advice would be helpful. And yes I know the best idea is probably to not do anything because there are a lot of reasons not to, but I literally just want to- and I think he also kind of wants to- and if I'm lucky I'll be transferring colleges next year and will never have to see him again. Also I'm an art student so admittedly I do want a weird erotic friendship to draw inspiration from. None of this is ironic, I'm just a really silly person. Thanks again",

I’m culturally/behaviorally inclined to prefer the guy to spend on me as the woman. Nothing lavish, but occasional dates. He does not like this even though he begrudgingly accepts to take me out sometimes. He likes splitting. We’re in our mid thirties. It feels childish for me to have to debate him over this yet we’ve had this talk and he thinks we should be 50/50 on spending. He makes more than me. His father is also like him. I personally think women more to lose in a relationship, and one way to show commitment is through financial investment. And it’s just more attractive to me than splitting. Am I crazy? What should be my standard here? Please don’t attack me, I simply want to see how to think about this issue in a wise way. I would appreciate your wisdom.\n\nTL;DR! My bf doesn’t like to spend on me and I have a problem with that.",

Over the past 15 years he has become reclusive and a hoarder. He lives 2 hours away, so we communicate through email, texts, and phone calls and have only met F2F about 3 times in the last decade. He has a few medical issues that have, over the past few years gotten more serious and have required a few of surgeries. Because he has drank to excess everyday for years and taken whatever Rx meds he can talk his doctors into prescribing (Xanax, muscle relaxants, etc.) they have contributed to the downward decline of his health. He not only refuses to do anything to get better, he is convinced that he knows better than than his PCP, his cardiologist, and his gastroenterologist and frequently ignores their advice to make the lifestyle changes that could improve his health. We have discussed his plan to \"go permanently\" when he decides he can't take the pain anymore.\n\nI've told him numerous times how his death will be excruciatingly painful for me as he is one of my few remaining friends.  I've tried everything I can think of to encourage him to make positive changes, such as getting out of the house, cutting way down on the alcohol and drugs, and following his doctors' advice. It just pisses him off that I \"lecture\" him and we end our conversations on a sour note.\n\nWhen I fail to respond quickly enough to his emails, texts, etc. he'll send me something that suggesting he's about to \"do it\" or he'll send me a photo such as the the graphic ones where he has deliberately cut himself!! I am aware that that is manipulative behavior, but, since I care about him, I always call immediately! That usually just turns into me listening to him talk, and talk, but rarely about his serious issues. He just wanted to talk to someone and I'm an easy mark.\n\n\\---\n\n\\*\\*TL;DR;\\*\\* : My question is this, \"Should I save myself the constant worry, anxiety, and emotional pain by cutting down, or even off, communication with him?\" Would that make me a bad person? Or should I just \"suck it up\" and keep allowing him to practice the emotional blackmail that has been constant and draining?",

It shattered me, and I was a wreck, even though I haven't even graduated high school yet. We had been dating for a little over a year, and it really did suck when I found out. Though throughout this time healing period, there was this one girl (15F) who will be referred to as \"C\" from now on. During this period after i found out C had always been there for me and when I needed it I'd just text her and she'd help, now after I've been healed and all if those memories are in a box stuffed in the back of my closet, I realized that I saw C as more than a friend. I feel she is one of the only people I can open up too, she has beautiful blue eyes, her smile is just enough to make anyone happy, and her hair is gorgeous, she  gives me butterflies in my stomach when ever i talk to her, she is the most caring person in the world, and even loves similar things i love to do (ex. Play video games, listen to the same genre of music, etc) Though there are a couple of \"bumps in the road,\" the first being that she is \"talking\" to someone already which I thought after meeting him I would stop loving her, usually after the fact with past crushes I would just stop then and there though only this time it didn't work, I still loved her. The other \"bump\" is the reason she is not dating this guy she's talking too, she was in a very bad relationship last time she was in one, she says she's not ready to date again yet until she finishes fighting her own demons. And now I'm off for spring break and have plans to hang out next week, should I tell her how I feel or should I wait and hope to get lucky and something happens between the guys and her?\n\nTL;DR\nMy gf cheated on me after the healing period I fell in love with a girl but she's into another guy and she also said that she doesn't want to date currently until she fights her own demons.\n\nThanks for taking the time out of your day to read this!",

I was tipped off that he liked me last month so him liking me wasn't a surprise, what was a surprise was how fast I feel this is moving. I haven't even had a conversation with this boy, I was thinking he would at least TRY to approach me first y'know flirt a little, maybe ask about the weather or something but no dice. He's not the first boy to like me, but the the first I've (kinda) liked back. What do I do now? We probably said three words to each other this entire school year, there is no prior relationship to build on. I have no idea how to proceed, like I can't just date him but also if I turn him down it'll feel awkward. I like this boy but not that much. I can't go on dates or text since I can't have a phone so just in case how do I navigate a school relationship? How do I enter and maintain a \"talking stage\" with a stranger? I was happy before this.\n\nTL;DR- boy (16m) likes me (16f) but we're basically strangers with no relationship before this.",

        "text": "I apologize if this is coming off as a bit long winded, but I'm at a big crossroads with this issue between my wife and my parents.\n\nFor basically the entirety of our time together (5 years married, 9 years together) my wife has disliked my parents. My wife is very sensitive, and can take things very personally/blow things out of proportion. My parents, who are definitely not without blame in this, can be a bit hard to deal with. My Mom is, to be honest, a bit of a narcissist. She's the kind of person that just isn't super warm, and can say things without a filter, and kind of makes things all about herself. To be honest, it's something I've been aware of, but until I met my wife, I never realized what a problem it was. I think that over time, I've just kind of dealt with it, and just wrote off her behavior as \"that's just Mom being Mom,\" but with my wife being so sensitive, I've gotten better at calling my Mom out on her behavior, though I admit I don't do it as much as I should.\n\nSome other important facts that will be relevant later on: My wife and I live about seven hours away from my parents. I have two brothers, both of them live four hours from our parents (but in different cities). My wife's parents live about 20 minutes away from us, and we see them often.\n\nMy wife has high anxiety around seeing my parents. Honestly, it's mostly my Mom; she and my wife are just like oil and water, as I kind of touched on earlier. Part of the reason is that my Mom has a history of saying some unkind things to her, and I admittedly wasn't great about standing up for her. It's something that I've gotten better at, but there's still some anxiety on my wife's part. I'd bring up the topic of my parents visiting/us visiting them once every 3-4 month or so, and usually it would start a big fight. I'd say about half of the time, my wife would agree to see them. We kind of came to an agreement when my wife said she only wanted to see them \"a few\" times a year. I agreed, mostly for the sake of keeping the peace, but we'd still get into arguments when I brought up seeing them. My wife and I have talked about putting up boundaries with my parents, which I'm working on, and I think I'm doing an okay job.\n\nOur daughter was born two and-a-half years ago. I had always assumed (perhaps hopefully) that my parents would change their ways when they became Grandparents; I had great relationships with my Grandparents on both sides, and was hoping that our daughter would have the same with my parents.\n\nHowever, it hasn't been quite like that. While they haven't been unkind, they're not the kind of grandparents I was hoping they'd be. For example, they rarely ask about our daughter unprompted. When we FaceTime them, they'll talk with our daughter for a few minutes, then go offI to talk about their own thing. It always feels like they want to be grandparents, but on terms that work for them. I also think it hasn't helped that my wifes parents, who see our daughter often, are the complete polar opposite of my parents; they're your typical lovey dovey grandparents.\n\nIn the first year of our daughters life, my wife had a tough time with PPD. As such, I didn't really push the topic of my parents visiting with her or them. Fortunately, due to Covid, I was able to kind of push off their requests to visit us.\n\nOnce Covid kind of let up in the Spring of 2021, they came down to visit us a few times. It was okay. My parents didn't really interact with out daughter like we hoped; they played with her a little, but they just seemed interested in working on their laptops and playing on their phones. My wife and I were both upset as to how that trip went. A few weeks after that, we went to visit them at their house, but we had to leave early because our daughter got sick. When we left, my parents seemed upset with us, and kept saying \"oh, she's not sick, she can stay, she seems fine,\" which bothered my wife and I.\n\nThings then were okay for a few months. We saw my parents a few times, but it was mostly at big events (Weddings, Anniversary Parties) so they didn't have much 1:1 interaction with our daughter. The last time they saw our daughter in person was for her birthday party. It felt like my parents didn't spend as much time with our daughter as they did with our niece (their other granddaughter). While I was a little hurt by it, but didn't say anything to them to keep the peace, my wife was completely disraught.\n\nSince then, things between my parents and my wife haven't been great. They've been acting the same; they'll ask about her intermittently, and do the same thing when we're on FaceTime. They've asked me a few times about coming down to visit, but when I bring it up to my wife, her response is \"no, I don't think they've earned the right to visit.\" My wife is of the mind that having a relationship with your grandkids is something that's earned, not given. While I agree to an extent, and I don't think that my parents have earned a free pass on everything, I do think that we could stand to foster a bit more of a relationship with them, but my wife won't have it.\n\nThings have come to a head when my parents have been trying to plan a week long vacation with us, my brothers and their spouses. For some context, my wife and I go to the beach for a week with her family, as do my brothers with their respective in-laws. My parents wanted to also book a vacation house with us, partly because they want to spend time with us, but also, because I think they're jealous.\n\nWhen I brought it up with my wife, it started a minor fight we ended up compromising that we wouldn't go for the whole week because she didn't want to spend that much time around my parents, rather, we'd just go for four days. I was worried about the optics of how that would look to my parents, but fortunately, neither of my brothers and their families could come for the whole week, either.\n\nI texted my parents to let them know that we'd only be going for four days, and shit totally hit the fan. I received a text from my Mom saying how sad and frustrated they are at how they haven't built the relationship with our daughter that they want to, and that they were hoping to spend the entire week with her. She also added that they keep wanting to come to see us, but I keep pushing them away. My mom then went on to say how she never had a relationship with her Grandmother (my Mom is an immigrant, so she never met her grandmother, as she came from her country of orgin), and that she would be sick if our daughter had the same relationship. She then went on to say how all three of her sons had great relationships with our grandparents, and we (my parents) never stood in the way of those relationships.\n\nAnyways, I'm just at my wits end with this. I can't exactly say \"well Mom, a big reason why I keep dodging your visits is because my wife hates you and your visits cause her massive anxiety.\" I feel like I've been able to put up this charade to them that everything is fine, but this feels like a house of cards that's about to fall over. Honestly, I just want everyone to get along, and I hate that both my Mom, and my Wife are upset at me, but both sides just keep digging their heels further into the ground, and I have no idea what to do here to keep the peace.\n\nTL;DR: My wife and my parents don't get along. My parents want to come to visit us and build a relationship with our daughter. My wife feels that they haven't earned the right to do so, but my parents don't like that I keep denying their visits, but I can't tell them why my wife doesn't want them visiting.",

She wanted me to move down to her, I didn't feel ready/got cold feet, we talked l, and we both determined that while we loved each other, our future long term goals just didn't match. She wanted to move and settle on the west coast while I wanted stay on the east coast near my family. Despite our break-up, we managed to repair and remain friends, which leads me to my conundrum. \n\nWhen we initially broke up, I had been offered a job in her city, as I had been looking ao I could move to her. After turning it down citing issues moving, they counter offered me and allowed me to work remotely. Now, I feel more ready to move to the city that my job is in and where my ex/friend is. The issue is, I'm kind of afraid to tell her. Me not moving was part of the reason we broke up in the first place, and I'm afraid that it will fully destroy our relationship if I decide to move and she feels betrayed. But I wanted to move then(just got too nervous) and want to move now. Does anyone have any advice how I should approach this? Does it sound like I'm overthinking this?\n\nTl;dr need advice on how to talk to my ex/friend without blowing up our new friendship",

        "text": "I don’t know where to go from here. A 6 year relationship down the drain. \n\nMy (27F) ex (29M) had weightloss surgery a little over a year ago now and (after losing over 100lbs) out of nowhere said he needed some time to see if he still wanted our relationship. That was on our anniversary in November. I spent thanksgiving by myself and on Christmas Day he gave me a card with a typed letter saying he couldn’t do this anymore but still wants to be friends.  \n\nI’m shocked and hurt. We have an apartment, phone lines, and pets together. We were saying to buy a house out of state to be closer to his family. Now all those plans mean nothing. He keeps in contact with me daily through text and even checks in when I don’t respond. \n\nA few days before he dumped me he texted me a TikTok, and when I opened it in app another person’s username and picture popped up saying they sent me the TikTok video. I clicked on the profile and saw it was a woman’s soft porn account on TikTok. I asked him if he knew anybody by that name and he lied and said no. Eventually it came out that this was his friend he was helping build a social media following (he is a truck driver). He had left several comments under her videos saying how beautiful she is. \n\nI recently found out that same “friend” posted my ex on a date with her on her Instagram with heart emojis. The post was from a week after he dumped me. My heart is shattered. I really can’t understand how he could jump to another woman in a week after being with me for 6 years. I can’t understand why he kept in contact with me while seeing someone else. \n\nTo put the cherry on top, he took off work to come into town for my birthday this weekend. I never asked or implied I wanted him to. Now he’s saying he needs to explain it to me in person because I just don’t understand him. What’s there to understand? What’s there to further explain? \n\nTLDR: My ex dumped me and I’m finding out now about possible cheating. He wants to explain in person, but I’m not sure what more there is to explain.",
