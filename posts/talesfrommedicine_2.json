        "text": "This story is about my dad and is actually about the way he acts at work, something I only found out about a few weeks ago. And it is awesome.\n\nMy dad has been an anesthesiologist for almost twenty years, throughout those twenty years he has worked at two separate hospitals as a main base and then has done on-off schedules at clinics and dental surgery offices throughout the city. Though mainly working at these 2 hospitals for his career. Of course that is not the main focus of this story. When I was born I was premature and stayed in the hospital for about a month, throughout that time he would visit me everyday as I was at the hospital my dad worked at.  Anyways, ever since I was born (18 years ago), my dad has been doing some amazing things for younger patients (Anywhere from 1- about 14), having four kids he knows that when a kid comes in that kid cannot be treated like an adult and the standard fair will not cut it. He has a permeant list of great jokes posted to the inside of his locker door that he uses daily (he’ll go look at it, find one that is appropriate for the situation and use it.) Such classics include when he meets the kids,\n “nice to meet you” *starts shaking hand* “Are you scared?” “No….” “Are you cold?” “No….” “Then why are you shaking?” He dad-jokes that kid to the moon and back. Other lines he uses is if the child is somewhat grumpy he will ask them the name of the boy/girl they stare at all day in class is called. They give completely honest answers. These small things of course are great for a kid who may have never had surgery before and is scared to death. Another thing I found out was he has a rubbermaid box (one of those 20 litter bins) full of new Teddy bears, it turns out when ever a child is really sad for multiple hours on end he will go out and grab on of these bears from his stash, it also gives him an excuse to go to this nice toy store every so often. But one of the best things I heard that he does that tops it all had to do with an elderly woman who was ill because of a respiratory problem. The woman had a daughter who was living in another city who was unable to be with her mother because of financial issues. My dad bought this woman a round trip and a hotel room for a few nights close to the hospital so that she could be with her mother, needless to say the woman and her mother cried multiple times throughout the experience, he only did that once. What you guys do is amazing and I am sure many of you work your asses off being sure that all your patients are comfortable and happy throughout their recovery. I commend each and every one of you for what you do and thought you might enjoy a happy story about a doctor.",

        "text": "Phleb here. Work in a relatively small hospital that boasts a farily large amount of patients. Mostly regulars - which the fellow in this story most definitely was not. Short and sweet, with a happy ending...\n\n\nPatient is Dirty Guy (DG), coworker is Young Phleb (YP), other coworker is Senior Phleb (SP) and then there's Me.\n\n\nYP calls DG to the draw station. DG is early 20's, covered in filth from his industrial job. On his lab slip are orders for a CMP, Trop, D Dimer and ICD-9 code for chest pain. He is pissed already that, shockingly, he is going to have to get blood drawn. Every other word out of his mouth is eff-this and eff-that. You get the idea - a real charming fellow.\n\n\n**DG: I hate needles! I don't see why I have to do this. I don't have good veins. Don't poke around in there!**\n\n**YP: Well, nobody really likes needles, but you're only getting 2 tubes drawn, so this'll be done quick.**\n\n\nYP goes in to stick DG, who jumps dramatically back in his chair before the *pediatric* needle she is using even touches him. Naturally, she doesn't get blood straight away. Protocol is to pull needle back slightly, to see if things get flowing. DG is already ballistic, however.\n\n**DG: Ow you effing bitch, you effing hurt me, arrrrrrh, I am in soooo much pain ow, stop digging around, why did you miss, you suck**\n\n**SP: She missed because you moved ten feet out of your chair. Don't look at the needle.**\n\n**DG: I didn't! Owwwie owwie owwie, eff-this, eff-that**\n\n\nAt this point, YP informs DG with great professional composure that he is a piece of work, that she doesn't have to attempt a second venipuncture due to his use of the f-word and namecalling, and I step in. I warn DG that I too will miss him if he jumps like he did. He's already falling back in his chair and grumbling, moving his arm around as I tie a tourniquet.\n\n\nI grab his arm and do a c-hold, move another pediatric needle his way. He jumps again, actually says \"Ow!\" again but I don't make contact until the jump is over. I wait for him to realize he has cried about nothing, *then* go in and stick him. Blood flows, he's clearly embarrassed, and the draw is completed.\n\n\n**DG: Well, I like THIS kind of needle (now is brandishing a crappy looking tattoo in an attempt to hit on me/not seem like a complete wuss) and not that kind.**\n\n\nOur story of DG wasn't completely over, though. Within the hour one of our techs downstairs informed us that his levels were off the charts and that he really should be monitored. His doctor must've agreed, because a short time later he presented at the ER, and surprise-surprise, had an attack while there. He lived and last I heard was brought back to stable condition.\n\n\nIn a perfect world, he'd thank us for getting his blood work despite his protests and for having a doctor who knows what he's doing... but...\n\n*edit: formatting*",

We do not provide transport home unless there are mobility issues or you are completely incapable of getting home*\n\nHis face was thunder and he quickly got onto the phone to his wife, explaining the situation.

        "text": "I wish I could stay out of this sub but for as long as the douchey clients keep coming, I simply can't...\n\n\nI've made a couple of other posts but if you haven't seen them then here is some background: I work in a veterinary practice which also has a little pet shop built in (no animals sold, only accessories). Receptionists, such as myself, can sit at one of two desk either in reception or in the pet shop.. either way you're dealing with clients, answering phones and taking payments.\n\n\nOn this particular day I was sat in the reception area and well known client came in - she is a posh, RICH and eccentric lady (RL), can be very difficult and rude on occasion. As she sits down with her cat some clients from the local museum come rushing in, one of their hens has been totally scalped by a rooster and I mean TOTALLY. All the skin from by her eyes all the way down her neck has been ripping off and is hanging, you can see her skull and blood is squirting everywhere. A vet rushes her through and takes the hen off. I apologise to the RL for what happened and began to explain\n\n\nMe: Sorry about that, as you can seen we've just had an emergency com-\n\nRL: ERM.. okay. But I have an appointment.\n\nMe: I know, I'm sorry. The hen had very severe injuries and it was an emergency, hopefully it won't be long and we can get you in to see the vet\n\nShe begins grumbling under her breath about her appointment and about 15 minutes tick by. She is sighing loudly and making loud comments about the waiting time, so I offer her a hot drink and something to read as I do feel a little sorry for her. About another 10 minutes pass\n\nRL: ERM..yes!! HELLO OVER THERE!! I had an appointment 25 minutes ago and I still haven't seen a vet...\n\nMe: I'm really sorry about the wait time, the vets are still with the emergency. If you like I can rebook your appointment to another day to save you waiting here?\n\nRL: Well no, I booked an appointment. So I want it to today.\n\n\nAnother 5 minutes tick past and she demands I ask the vets where they are and what they are doing and what their ETA is. I oblige and head round into theater to see whats happening. The vet (there was only one on duty this day) has been with the owner of the chicken discussing the options, giving pain relief and were now in the process of gassing it down (sedation) to put it to sleep. I returned and let RL know what was happening and informed her it would be a maximum of 10 more minutes and she just lost it.\n\n\nRL: what?? WHAT?????? I had an appointment. AN APPOINTMENT. WHY WASN'T MY APPOINTMENT KEPT. WHY DID THEY GET TO GO IN BEFORE ME???\n\nMe: I know, I am really sorry. But it was an emergency, they couldn't have waited.\n\nRL: WELL IT'S BEING PUT TO SLEEP, SO IT COULD HAVE WAITED COULDN'T IT???\n\nMe: I'm sorry but no it couldn't have waited, the hen needed urgent medical attention. It was an emergency. The vet will be with you shortly though.\n\nRL: AN EMERGENCY??? WHAT EMERGENCY??? YOU JUST DON'T WANT TO SERVE ME. YOU'RE REFUSING ME SERVICE. THAT IS ILLEGAL. I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT, YOU CANNOT REFUSE ME SERVICE FOR NO REASON.\n\nMe: I am not refusing you service, I am sorry you had to wait but it won't be much longer now.\n\nRL: YOU PEOPLE HERE WERE THE ONES WHO TOLD ME I NEEDED THE APPOINTMENT ANYWAY. I DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO BRING HER, SHE HAS ONLY BEEN VOMITING FOR 5 DAYS, BUT YOU TOLD ME I HAD TO AND NOW YOU'RE REFUSING ME SERVICE. I AM NEVER EVER COMING BACK HERE.\n\n\nAt this point she stormed out (she was literally seconds away from being seen). She then returned two days later as the cat was still vomiting..\n\nedit: formatting ",

I work as a receptionist and also as an animal care assistant.. this takes place when I was on reception. \n\nSO.. I am working as the only receptionist, Saturday and Sunday are very busy days for us and often book up in advance. We try and keep appointments open to the day and of course will accept any and all emergencies who need to come in. We try to divert people wanting appointments for less important things until the week days (we are open 8-8, Mon-Fri) - so things like.. getting a booster vaccination, claw clips, eye/ear infections (provided they're not horrific and the animal isn't suffering horribly), etc.\n\nSo today I turned our work phones over at 9.30 and it rang none stop for about 45 minutes, I booked a couple of standard apps, a couple of emergencies and managed to book a few others for tomorrow. People have generally been nice and are understanding. Then sick cat lady (SCL) calls...\n\nMe: Good morning [vets name], bigeyesbambi speaking how can I help?\n\nSCL: (cutting me off half way through my greeting) er yeah, hi. My cat came in with an eye infection on Thursday and got tablets and the vet said to come back in a week to recheck the eye and I want to come in today and 11.\n\nMe: I'm really sorry, we are completely booked this morning and I also have 3 emergencies coming down so we don't have anything available at all. Can I book you in for tomorrow morning, or perhaps Thursday when your tablets are finished?\n\nSCL: Well, i don't know about you, but I work Monday-Friday, 9-5. So no I can't come on a week day.\n\nMe: I totally understand, we do stay open until 8pm so perhaps I could book you in on an evening?\n\nSCL: -long pause- Well, I need to come in today, the vet said I need to come back sooner if it gets worse\n\nMe: Okay so sorry, I think i've misunderstood. So the eye is now worse?\n\nSCL: Well, I don't know. That's why I am phoning you. You tell me.\n\nMe:.... I can't see the cat so I am not going to be able to pass comment.\n\nSCL: Well she was in last week so.. you tell me. Do I need to come in?\n\nMe: I'm really sorry, I can't make that judgement. Has she been herself? Is she eating and drinking? Is the eye swollen or bloody or has more discharge?\n\nSCL: Well I don't know, she's been sleeping. What do you think? Can it wait until tomorrow? If you can 100% guarantee me that my cat is fit and healthy and fine I will come in tomorrow. That's why i'm calling you, that's why you people are in business isn't it??\n\nMe: I am really sorry but I cannot and do not feel comfortable passing that judgement as I cannot see your cat and even if I could as a receptionist I cannot make diagnoses.\n\nSCL: But that is your job.. just tell me if she is sick enough to come in???\n\nAfter a bit of back and forth I booked her in but warned her she may have to wait for up to two hours, which she thought was unfair because it's not her fault she works in the week.\n\n(NOTE: Usually I am all for subtly sticking it to customers who are rude jerks, but I would never put an animals welfare at risk!)\n\nedit: spelling and formatting",

But if you're wanting to be seen I can get you re-registered and in for an appointment. \n\nSoS: (confused but thankful anyway). Ok, I'll come down later. \n\nThen enter the mother. This woman has been the bane of my life for the last two years. Shouting, screaming, works in health care so knows everything. Ironic given she works in the local psychiatric hospital, because given her manner to us, I'd refuse to let her near me. \n\nS: My daughter informs me that you are refusing to give her an appointment. \n\nMe: What I actually said to SoS was that the health board had requested we deduct her notes. \n\nS: I DID NOT AUTHORIZE THAT AND NEITHER DID SOS. \n\nMe: I don't know why the health board requested her notes and to deduct her from the system, but legally, I have to return records if they request it.

Just had something rustle my jimmies and I wanted to share with a community that might understand. And sorry but there will be no formatting magic but I'll do my best!\n\nSo I work the front desk (obviously) at a very small, family run, practice. I never really get russled by patients who try and insult me, the practice, or who are just generally being an ass. But today kindof hit home for some reason.\n\nOur players:\n\nBe me, friendly neighborhood Racky: A baller... not really. level headed and never angry. Soft spoken over the phone such that people confuse me with a woman. Nice all around though.\n\nDefinitely don't be Impatient Former Patient (IFP for short): Never met this woman but she falls in what I believe people have deemed to be the \"millenial\" generation. Not by any means a frequent patient and judging by her history at the practice, doesn't take very good care of her mouth. \n\nSo the day's going pretty smoothly, all patients are happy, helped out people who needed emergencies, even had some people's records prepared short notice for pickup. SUDDENLY A WILD PHONECALL APPEARS! \n\nRack: Hello (office) how may I help you?\n\nIFP: Hello I used to go to (office) but I am no longer a patient there.\n\n*note this is normally a sign of a disgruntled patient. I say this based on her wording as \"I am no longer a patient there\" means that they normally decided to go somewhere else. Not to mention the fact that she already sounded quite disgruntled for no apparent reason. Man the battlestations! \n\nRacky: Alright your name please. Alright great how may I help you ms. (name)?\n\nIFP: Well I moved a while ago (It's now been almost a year since we've heard from her but whatever, sounds like she's not actually angry) and I need my records transferred. I want you guys to email them to my new office. How do I go about doing that?\n\nSo according to HIPAA regulations we can't just go sending people's records all around. We need a Signed form to be filled out by the patient but for people who can't plan ahead we allow them to send us a certified and signed letter stating exactly what we want them to do with their records. I explain this to her and then the kicker:\n\nRacky: Unfortunately we don't have email here and we would be unable to email the records to the new office. \n\nNow for those of you with a confused look on your face, yes it's strange. However we do this because we're a tiny practice and we don't really have the funds for any expensive digital x-ray equipment, nor do we have the funds to properly set up a system to keep separate from everything else in order to safely download things off of emails while keeping patient information safe (not to mention the doctor is a bit of a technophobe who's constantly worried about opening a virus thru email attatchments). \n\nTo be honest I understand the doctor's sentiment in not wanting to risk anything by accepting emails. I am by no means a technophobe but the last time I read about a practice who's information got hacked, they were fined hundreds of thousands of dollars for the leak, something that would put us out of business. \n\nIFP: Well then can I email you that document?\n\nI happily rexplain our policies.\n\nIFP: So how am I supposed to get this to you? How am I supposed to get my records?\n\nRacky: Oh well you can either mail them to us or have them faxed. Whatever works best for you.\n\nIFP: I need those records to be at my doctor's by (a little less than two weeks (not to mention less than a week's worth of business days due to holiday seasons))! How am I supposed to get them! It's just rediculous that anyone doesn't have email in 20-14.\n\nRacky: Well in the past patients have sent us a fax from their email so I know that's a possibility. \n\nIFP: So you're telling me that in 20-14 I can't email you something?! That's just absurd! I've never heard of this in my life grumble grumble... What's your fax number.\n\nRacky: (fax). Is there anything else I can help you with?\n\nBy now IFP has gone from being aggrivated, to unpleasent, to rude and indignat.\n\nIFP: No. I still can't believe you all don't have internet... (insert brief lecture on how stupid we are for running the practice like this)... If that's how things are run over there I am glad that I am no longer a patient over there because that is just rediculous to not have EMAIL in 20-14!\n\nRacky: jawonthefloor.jpg\n\nclick\n\nwell guys I'm sorry to say but even as a milenial myself, this is kindof terrible. What she said wasn't so horrible, even though she WAS terribly rude. What was terrible about it was how self absorbed she was. It's been over a year since we heard of her. If she really wanted to be prepared, why didn't she let us know sometime back then? More importantly, how did she not understand that to us, it's more important to keep our patient's information secure than it is to help you get your last minute appointment in before your benefits reset for next year (I've been working here long enough to know that was the reason she needed it before the start of next year. It's just how people try to make sure they use their insurance to it's fullest extent, can't blame 'em). What with the hacking of the sony thru email, constant hacks thru target, and most notably the state department itself, how is it more important for her to have things NOW than for us to prevent peoples names, dates of birth, insurance information, addresses, AND SSNs stolen? loosing those things can literally ruin someone's life. \n\nTL;DR: former patient can't prepare things more than a week ahead of time. gets pissed off when she can't get what she wants RIGHT NOW because fuck anyone's right to privacy.\n\nP.S sorry for the text wall, not very good at editing\n\nedit: bad spelling.\n",

        "text": "I watch her stumble through the ER doors, sunglasses on, an elderly woman gripping her arm.  I ask if she’d like a wheelchair, and the resulting shake of her head nearly topples her.  I put one under her anyway.\n\nRegistration is an ordeal—constant bickering between she and her mother—an undulation of wailings and attempts to convince the billing representative that her barbiturate prescription isn’t working.  Her wristband reads 44, though she’s acting quite childish.\n\nThe triage nurse agrees, her intoxication is obvious, though neither of us can explain it.  Benzodiazepines untouched, a full bottle, filled a month prior.  The patient denies medicating today and any drug use, though I’m not sure anyone believes her.  The medications make no difference in the severity of her six-month headache, she wails.  Standing beside her wheelchair, the nurse tapping at her keyboard, I entertain brief musings of nerve blocks and curing her instantly.  Her mother explains that their presentation today is simply for answers.\n\nI start her IV after the shift’s sub-acute physician orders the standard workup: blood counts, metabolites, and a CT of her head. Her veins are gigantic, virgin, her only surgical history that of an epidural prior to the birth of her single daughter.  She sobs.  No one ever complains about my sticks.\n\nA younger tech exclaims that she is “very interested to see what her urine shows,” though her doctor didn’t bother with a drug screen.  I reply that it will be pristine, that nothing will come of the workup.\n\nA second attending orders an EKG and add-on cardiac labs.  Why?  Her initial blood is flawless.  My surprise is palpable.\n\n“The radiologist called.  Her CT showed mets,” the scribe whispers after receiving my confused look. The physician and I walk her to another, more private room.  Along the way he interrogates her gait.  “Everyone asks me if I’m drunk,” she replies in a moment of lucidity.\n\nTogether we seat her in the bed.  He sits on a stool beside her and explains that her blood looks great.  “Your CT scan, however, is very concerning.  Very bad news.”  I close the door.\n\nHours later I intercept the same physician in the hallway.  “It’s a very difficult conversation,” he admits, and assures me that it was quite unexpected.  In the few hours after discovery, surgery is unlikely, and the prognosis poor.  I apologize to him about my pegging her as a seeker.  Neither of us has much else to say.",

        "text": "**Edit**: This is a cross-post from r/talesfromthejob\n\nSo I work at at large hospital in my state in admissions. If you're a patient who has an appointment for any scanning, pretesting, removal and placement of medical equipment, same day surgery, etc. If you have a reason to be at the hospital and you're not going to through the ED or inpatient services, you go through us so we can check your insurance. What we do not do, however, is set up appointments.\n\nAbout an hour ago, I had a patient come in with an insurance referral to have a drainage pump removed; okay, cool this is easy; I just need an account number. So I go to find their account and...there isn't one. Strange. Okay, so I search their name....no record of them by name. So I question the patient for about ten minutes about what all is going on, the steps they've completed, and who they've spoken to. All I get from the patient is:\n\nPatient: \"I had a pump placed in me at this hospital and I had to change my primary doctor, so after I did, my new doctor told me to come here to get it removed because ya'll were the ones who put it in.\"\n\nMe: Okay, who was the doctor?\n\nPatient: Well, I had to change it from MD1 to MD2 because I had to get this referral for my insurance.\n\nMe: And they set up an appointment for you to come here?\n\nPatient: They told me to come here to get it removed.\n\nMe: But did they actually set up an appointment for it? I can't find you or an account in our system.\n\nPatient: I'm not sure\n\n(sigh)\n\nSo I call five different departments, all of whom have no idea what I'm talking about; talk to my boss twice, who says to call the primary MD's office; call said MD's office since that MD is not in our hospital records, the office which also closed early b/c it's Friday, and just when I'm about to call the medical exchange to page the MD personally....\n\nPatient: All I need ya'll to do is set up an appointment so I can get this pump removed today. Can ya'll set up an appointment or not?\n\n(insert sounds of screeching brakes)\n\nMe: ....We don't schedule appointments, only MD offices can do that and they send the forms to our scheduling dept. who sets up accounts and put you in our system.\n\nPatient: So ya'll can't schedule me today?\n\nMe: No, only your primary care physician can do that, so you'll have to call them, but since their office is closed, you'll have to go to the ER if you need it removed today.\n\nPatient: Oh...I probably should have asked you that from the start, shouldn't I?\n\nIn my mind, I was thinking, \"Yeah, you probably should have, before I spent half an hour fretting over why you're not in the system.\"\n",

This *special* individual hands me a folded up piece of paper, explaining it was a copy of their license that the health department had printed out.  I unfold it to find weed still stuck in the crease in the paper.  This person has come in to take a DS and handed me a paper copy of their license, which has clearly been used to break up weed on.   Smooth.  \n\n(2)An individual came in to take a DS.  They proceeded into the bathroom normally, everything was fine.  They came out a few minutes later splattered almost head to toe in yellow food coloring.  Apparently they had smuggled in a bottle of yellow dye to add to a very diluted specimen, and it had backfired horribly when the package they had stored it in epically failed.  ",

It's a small rural hospital, which does have 15 beds, but only one physician from 7pm-7am and the PA leaves at midnight. So from about midnight to 3 am we had a flood of about 15-20 patients, and everyone was frustrated and tired. We have a lady come in with complaints of back pain. Pain is almost always complicated, but we do try to do what we can to help if you aren't obviously doctor shopping (when you come in saying your physician won't write more and you need us to write them instead...yeah, we can't do that).\n\n\nWe go in to get the story from the patient after she had been in her room for about an hour due to how busy we were. She is dead asleep. We could hear her snoring from down the hall. The physician actually has to physically shake her to get her to wake up. When she does wake up, she immediately begins crying and telling us about her back pain. At this point, the physician just can't take it anymore.\n\n&gt; Woman: I've been in excruciating pain all night, it's a 10 out of 10 and I just can't handle it anymore (etc. etc. plus excessive weeping)\n\n&gt; Physician: Right, it's so excruciating that you were asleep.\n\n\nThe woman immediately switches from crying to yelling about how rude the physician was and how he wasn't going to help her at all (which is never true) and her and her husband left.

        "text": "A few years ago, I had a liver surgery to take the left lobe.  Typical surgery (it seemed) and I woke up just fine.  Spent six days in the hospital and went home.  But on the last night in the hospital, I started vomiting bile every few hours.  Got some anti-nausea meds and called it good.\n\nEverything was well for about three days being home.  Everything hurt, and I didn't eat much but it wasn't too bad.  Then on the third day, I started to get full really quickly.  Like a glass of gatorade felt like a five course meal.  So naturally I started throwing up everything I ate.  Everything.  Four times a day.  Went to the hospital at 0130 (which was an hour and a half away, thanks insurance!) Was told to consume only liquids and see how my health improved.  \n\nMoved to drinking only ensure and maybe crackers with the pain medicine.  Didn't change anything.  Waited approximately a week and the symptoms were still present, so I went back and received the same answer.  At this point, I was at my wit's end because I'd already lost about thirty pounds in under two weeks.  Went home and tried out the liquid diet again, but this time just gatorade ice cubes so I could actually continue to live.\n\nWith my body matching that of Skeletor, I went back the last time and demanded to be admitted until they could fix the issue where I couldn't eat and would constantly vomit.  My nose and throat were burning, and I was literally starving because everything that went down came right back up.  And did I mention that the liver surgery was done with an open incision? That's right I had a six inch incision through the muscle from my sternum to my belly button.  So throwing up was even worse and was only getting worse.\n\nFinally I get admitted and they can't get an IV in because I couldn't even keep down water.  12 pokes and 2 nurses later they get an IV in and rush me potassium and iron because my heart was not beating correctly?  And they started to give me pain medicine (which will come into play later).  The surgeon overseeing my care opts for the PICC line and feeding tube approach.  The procedure for the line was like nails against a chalkboard with myself being awake and having a rather long tube pushed through the vein in my bicep towards my heart.  Like spaghetti through my insides.  \n\nEventually I did get better due to a combination of my body actually having fuel to function and a stress reduction because I knew I wasn't going to die.  And so begins the worst part of the ordeal: chronic pain caused by such rapid weight loss.  I had lost fifty pounds in a little over three weeks (I'm 5'7\" and 150 of muscle).  Everything hurt, all the time, and it didn't ever stop.  So began my foray into being constantly sedated and loopy.  \n\nPain meds continue for two months, until I start getting a feeling in my shoulder like I'm being stabbed.  Obviously I'm not being stabbed, so I google the symptoms and it matches that of a gallbladder attack (which was removed during surgery).  Again, I attempt to see my doctor and there was no answer for the pain that occur in my shoulder at night.  Most nights I couldn't sleep, so I'd go into work exhausted and in constant agony.  The surgeon had decided that it was the last bit of the liver section they removed finally dying off so that the new portion could completely grow.  \n\nAfter the shoulder pain had finally died down, I was left with the chronic pain from my weight loss.  My chest, shoulders and back muscles had become over stretched and tight (a fact I wouldn't find out until February and this was mid-August).  So I continue with the pain medicine and return to college for my junior year.  The battery of tests continued attempting to find the source of this pain.  There was no result and the answer was to increase my pain medicine.  In five months since the surgery, I'd moved from vicodin to percocet 10's.  I was constantly unable to fall asleep or focus because of the strength of the medicine required to make life bearable.  \n\nFast forward to February and I'm referred to PT who specializes in post-surgery trauma (perfect!).  In an hour she had diagnosed the cause of the pain and developed a lengthy 4 month \"re-hab\" plan.  I stayed and continued with the PT and religiously did my exercises at home, but the pain reduction was only moderate. \n\nAt this point, I've accepted that I'll always be in pain.  And I believe that my other medical issues, i.e. chronic gastritis, localized back pain that occurs when the gastritis does, and extreme anxiety about losing any sense of control in my own life.  The loss of control of what was really my mortal life still stays with me.  I get anxious and uncomfortable if I'm not busy, because I feel like I'm losing control, or if I'm in a situation where I can't change anything.  ",

He's quite an elderly Caucasian gentleman with pneumonia and delirium. He has the internal medicine six-pack of co-morbidities (one is dementia). Very standard consult. \n\nI'm in the room just running through my questions, the family has gone home, when he stops. Looks at me intently and says:\n&gt;Caucasian Male (CM): You look like my son! \n\nNow I'm pretty sure that this is not true. First of all, CM is not oriented to time or place and second of all I'm Chinese - have been all my life. \n\nAs a way to re-orient him I assure him that I don't look like his son. He looks at me intently again.\n&gt;CM: But I'm so sure you look like him!\n\n&gt;GeCk0: It's okay! I get mistaken for other people all the time! It's the big head. It disorients people.\n\nI finish up my history and physical. Get his admission orders in place and move on with my night. \n\nLater on in the night I'm just glancing in to make sure he's doing okay when he looks up and sees me.\n\n&gt;CM: Henry (name's been changed)! I'm so glad you're here! I'm scared! It's so dark in here and there's  too much noise! \n\nI walk into the room and I let him grab my hand\n\n&gt;GeCk0: It's okay! I know it's disorienting with all that noise but you're at &lt;hospital&gt;'s emergency department. Your family will be here in the morning.\n\n&gt;CM: Oh.. good. Henry, there's a guy who said he was a doctor who was here earlier. Looked just like you. He didn't think so though. \n\n&gt;GeCk0: It's me Dr GeCk0. I'm not sure who Henry is - but we will figure it out in the morning. \n\nHe let's my arm go after a few minutes and drifts back off to sleep. I go back to doing what i was doing. No more incidents for the night. \n\nThe next day we're reviewing patients and get to CM's room. As my staff and I step inside we are greeted by the wife (who is also caucasian). We have a quick discussion and the wife asks us to speak with the son Henry, who is off getting a coffee. \n\nAs we're stepping out a Chinese man walks into the room with an arm full of coffees. \n\n&gt;GeCk0: Henry?\n\n&gt;Henry: Yes? Oh! You must be the doctors! Sorry I had just stepped out! \n\n&gt;GeCk0: Holy crap I do look like his son!\n\n&gt;Henry: What? Oh... yea this must look weird. I'm adopted.\n\nMy attending gives me a strange look and just before I depart for the day I tell him the whole story. He bursts out laughing. \n\n&gt;Attending: You just thought he was a racist? That's racist!\n\nI love medicine - but I especially love how medicine teaches you things about yourself. So... lesson learnt. Don't jump to conclusions. Oh.. and I'm the racist.\n\n\n**tl;dr I'm racist**",

We get our share of colorful characters.  Saturday was no exception.\n\nOf course, an hour before we close, a mother and her son come in.  He's fucked up his hand one way or another and probably needs stitches.  So I do the bit, have you been here before, what insurance do you carry etc etc.  Cigna!  How great.  We are in network with Cigna.\n\n\"Alright!  So I'll just need sections one and two [of the forms], and the policy holder in section three.  Are you over the age of 18?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" says the son.\n\n\"Okay so I just need the signature on the back for HIPAA and when you're done I'll take your photo ID and insurance card.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" his mother interjects, \"he doesn't have his license with him.\"\n\nI internally prepare for the inevitable.  I turn to the son.  \"I'm sorry, but our policy dictates that we need a valid photo ID at the time of the visit in order to be seen,\" I said, gesturing to a fantastic sign that we have printed up right next to where I'm sitting, in plain view.\n\n\"Well, can't you use my license?\"  Mom says.  I sigh.  \n\nUsually if the kid is 18, I'll fudge it and use the parent's ID because I've never known an 18 year old to remember their license and I understand that.  The only deal breaker there is if they don't reside with the parent who is bringing them in.\n\n\"Does he reside with you?\"  I ask.\n\n\"Actually,\" says the son, \"she just moved to Arizona and I live in PA with my dad.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, then, we can't see your son.  It's the policy that we have a photo ID at the time of the visit and since that's not something you can provide, we can't see him.\"\n\n\"Is there a manager I can speak to?\"  Mom says, her tone changing from compliant to threatening.\n\n\"She is not in the office today.\"\n\n\"Then is there a DOCTOR I can speak to?\"\n\n\"The doctor's have no bearing on our policies here but I'll be more than happy to call my manager at her home!\"  I flash a plainly fake smile and as expected, my manager didn't pick up.  You know why?  Because it's motherfucking Saturday.\n\nI relay to the angry Mom, \"My manager didn't pick up, and I'm sorry, but without that photo ID, we cannot see your son.\"\n\nThe son was totally okay with this.  He was content to leave and try someplace else, but the mom was not having any of it.\n\n\"Well what if I can have a copy of it faxed over?\"\n\nI look at her and I hope it looked more apologetic than aggravated.  The son tells her that they'll just try somewhere else.\n\nAfter they leave, my manager calls back and asks if everything is okay.  So I tell her the tale about how this woman just wanted to hear the same thing I told her come from another person because for some reason asking for a valid photo ID from an adult is being unreasonable.\n\n\"You need ID,\" she exclaimed, \"Why don't people understand this!?  Anyway you did the right thing.  Enjoy your night!\"  ",

Truth be told, he's been having issues with them for months, and I'm surprised he took this long to cut ties with them. Anywhoo, I now have to call all our patients will 123-insurance, and let them know.\n\nNot surprisingly, they have not been happy. Been calling everyone with appointments for tomorrow, and next week.. They've been unhappy, but most just grumbled and hung up. However, a few notable patient reactions include: \n\n- One lady seemed to start crying, but she hung up too quickly for me to make sure.  \n\n- A man started ranting about how he has been seeing Dr M for years, so Dr M should still take his insurance, because he is a follow up patient. \n\n- Another lady asked if we could make an exception for her, even if not for the others, a just bill her 123-insurance instead of charging her.\n\n- And the last one who really pissed me off: The guy who started calling my boss an irresposinble inconsiderate twat. See, this patient had an appointment two weeks ago, but it got cancelled. My boss has been going through a rough patch in life, and nearing a mental breakdown. So, two weeks ago he canceled his appointments, and left to spend a week with what's left of his mom's family. He even brought back pictures of him and his sisters visiting their mom's grave with their uncles. He came back beaming, saying he hadn't realized how much stress he was under, or how much he had missed his family- especially after just getting divorced. Declared that no matter what, he'd make it a point to travel back there at least twice a year from now on. Obviously, patient doesn't know all this, but still, it irked me. My boss is a nice man, and a dedicated doctor, and hearing this guy insulting him for \"taking a goddamn pleasure cruise, probably to drink and f*ck with someone\" really annoyed me. \n\nWhile dealing with the last aptient I did my best to keep a courteous tone, but after a few minutes of his constant stream of screams and rants and insukts, I just hung up. He called back, asking if i had \"f*cking hung up on him\". I told him the type of language he was using wasn't acceptable here, and hung up again. He called twice more, but I didn't pick up (blessed be the ID Caller). He also left a cuss-filled message, but seemed to give up. \n\nSigh...\n\nNow, off to keep calling patients to inform thm. I hope I don't get another jerk like that one. ",

I was told about you guys over at /r/TalesFromRetail and I am so glad to have found this sub!\n\nSo, a little background - I work as a receptionist (soon to be a clinical medical assistant!) at an Urgent Care facility.  You don't need an appointment (though you can make one online).  We are open from 10 to 8 every day.  We're also in a rather affluent area so we get a lot of entitled people who wait until the *last possible effing minute* to come get evaluated by one of our fantastic ER Doctors.\n\nYesterday was particularly busy, lots of patients who were just extra painful to deal with (some in my post history as a matter of fact), but we get a phone call at 7:50 from a woman whom we will address henceforth as Angrah Patient.\n\nAngrah Patient asks right away, \"What time do you stop taking patients?\"\n\n\"We stop taking patients at 8:00pm,\" I say.  \n\n\"Okay I'm gunna head over real quick, I just have a leg thing going on.\"  Hangs up.\n\nA \"leg thing\"?  That could mean anything.  Broken leg?  Clot?  Did it happen at work or in a vehicle?  All of these things have bearing on a patient's visit time, and how they have to fill out paperwork.  It's also important that the patient tell us what's going on so we can determine whether or not we can even properly treat them (aka we'll send them to the ER in the event that it's serious enough).\n\nMy co-worker and I are actively registering two more patients when Angrah Patient calls again, this time at 7:57p.  This time my co-worker picks up the phone.\n\n\"What time do you stop taking patients?\" Angrah Patient says.\n\n\"We lock the door at 8:00,\" says co-worker. \n\n\"What if I get there in...fiiiiive minutes?\" Angrah says.\n\n\"If you get here in three minutes we will see you.  But the doors are shut at 8:00p.\"  Angrah Patient hangs up.\n\nFinally, 8:00p, the last patients are registered, and I'm literally about to get up to lock the door when the phone rings.  I answer.  It lasts about minute.\n\n8:01, Angrah Patient emerges from the darkness.  She is scowling already as she walks from her car to our door, which is not locked.  She opens the door.\n\nAs apologetically as I can, I tell her, \"I'm sorry miss, we don't take any patients after 8:00p!\"\n\n\"You said you lock the door at 8:00.  The door is not locked.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry miss,\" I repeat, \"but we can't take any patients after 8:00.  We open again tomorrow at 10, however!\"  Trying to make her bad experience with us by extending a good hand, you know.\n\n\"That doesn't help me!  I think I have a clot in my leg!\"  She begins to back out toward the door.\n\n\"Then miss, it might actually be better for you to go right to the ER in that case - we don't have the means to determine if you have a blood clot.\"\n\nSo she sneers at me and says, \"WELL YOU SHOULD LOCK THE DOOR AT 8:00 LIKE YOU SAID, THAT'S NOT GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE.\"  So as she leaves I bid her a nice night and I exchange a knowing glance with the patients in the waiting room, and start my clean up routine.",

I start to lose my patience. \n\n\nI reach the insurance rep on the phone...  who informs me this lady's insurance expired *last year. * She had gone around the past month flashing her card totally clueless. We verify most insurances online due to time constraints. All insurances that need to be verified by phone are passed to billing or whoever. Which is what happened to her, the next department called her insurance, found she wasn't covered and she got charged the uninsured amount. \n\n\nI tell her this and she goes all \"No no no, you're wrong, I have insurance.\" I'm really annoyed by now and tell her she needs to contact her insurance herself because it's not even my company's problem anymore. \n\n\nAnd without more fuss, she leaves, thankfully.

First time poster here, long time lurker, blah, blah, blah.\n\nI work front desk for a retina doctor's office, most of the time we will have 3 doctors in the office most of the week.  So we see a ton of patients every day and lots of new patients. We usually send out paperwork packets to the new patients so they can have them filled out before coming in. (Usually the older patients take 30+ minutes just to fill out 3 pages and sign 2...)  \n\nThis morning, I had an older gentleman come in, new patient with paperwork in hand.  I take the paperwork from him and ask for the usual things, insurance cards and picture ID.  He hands me his Medicare card and his secondary insurance card. I'm waiting on him to hand me his driver's license or some form of picture identification. We scan all the cards into the system and use the picture from the driver's license as a picture in their chart. I'm going to call this guy, Paranoid Man (PM).\n\nMe: Can I get your picture ID, please, sir?\n\nPM: No, you can not. \n\nMe: *questioning look on my face*\n\nPM: I can show it to you, but I can't hand it to you.\n\nMe: Okay... Well, I need to get it from you so I can scan it into our system, sir.\n\nPM: Nope. I refuse to let anyone handle my driver's license. My brother, he went to a doctor's office, gave them his license and he ended up having his identity stolen and everything. So, by the order of my lawyer, I will not, and do not HAVE to give you my driver's license.\n\nMe: *100% confused by this guy, but not batting an eye...* Hmm... Well, okay. I'll just take a picture of you then using my little webcam here.\n\nPM: Okay, that's fine. You can do that.\n\nSo I scan his insurance cards in, take his picture, and tell him to have a seat.  I look at his paperwork as I'm going through the process of checking him in, and right there, in the line for his SS# is his social!  *face palm*  Seriously?  I look over at my co-worker and we both look at each other with the same look of \"you have got to be kidding me...\"\n\nI'm pretty sure that you can't steal someone's identity just from a driver's license. Sure, they can go to your home and steal their mail and go through all those great lengths. But he basically handed over the shorter route by writing down his SS# on his paperwork. Just didn't make any sense to me, if he's THAT paranoid about having his identity stolen. Some people can be just so clueless about things.\n\nTL;DR - Guy thinks identities are stolen by driver's licenses, but is ok with writing down his SS#.",

I'm glad I discovered your subreddit today because I oftentimes forget that the same bullshit we deal with on a daily basis comes to you to get their drugs first. \n\nI don't know how you feel about patient responsibility, but I would like to think we're on the same page in that, at the end of the day, the patient is ultimately responsible for their health and well-being. Unfortunately, I find that an inordinately high number of patients are too often unaware they're out of refills (even though the bottle says so) and, more often than not, wait until they've finished the bottle before requesting one. It's actually become the norm, and weekends are notorious for this.\n\nWe have a phone line that gives doctors direct access to our pharmacist should they feel the need. The pharmacist is in the bathroom and the phone rings, so I pick it up to at least acknowledge who I thought was a doctor on the other end. Nope, it's a patient asking me to refill two medications. Thankful it was something I could help with (we can't take new prescriptions from a doctor over the phone, only a pharmacist), I pulled up his profile to see a few medications dispensed. Nothing refillable though.\n\nMe: \"What are you looking to refill?\"\n\nGuy: \"An antibiotic and a cough syrup.\"\n\n(looks in profile, sees that a script for azithromycin and another for promethazine DM were filled back in *January 2013*)\n\nMe: \"Sir, neither of those prescriptions were written with refills. I cannot refill these without a new prescription from your doctor.\"\n\nGuy: \"Are you sure? Can you check?\"\n\nMe: \"I pulled up the image, she clearly marked it with the intention of prescribing it only one time.\"\n\nGuy: \"This is BULLSHIT! I just saw her last week for tests! I wasn't feeling sick then. I already know what's wrong with me! I don't need to go back and pay another f-ing copay!\"\n\nMe: \"You'd have to take that up with her. She's the one qualified to treat you, and if she wants an appointment to make a proper diagnosis, then you'll have to make one. These medications are not usually prescribed with the intent to be refilled.\"\n\nGuy: (incoherent grumbling) \"Can't you send a fax?\"\n\nMe: \"It's been well over a year since she's written for these medications, it is more than likely she will require an appointment to determine their necessity. I can certainly send a request, but it is unlikely she will answer it.\"\n\nGuy: \"Just fax my fucking doctor.\"\n\nTL;DR: Patient thinks he knows better than his doctor. This was on Friday and her office is open on the weekends. I'm happy to say she did not answer the request and she's pretty quick with responding to them. \n\nAlso, wanted to show some appreciation from someone who couldn't possibly get on a personal level enough to rival what you do! Sure, patients are more than happy to show me their festering leg wounds and itchy bites, but I don't have to touch them. Have a good week. :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n",

        "text": "This actually happened about a year ago. I'm a european doc in internal medicine and I was working the night shift, which means I also had to cover the ER.\n\nIt was a quiet night and somewhere around 4:30 I got a call from an ambulance. They were bringing an unconcious guy in, probably OD'ed on ghb. Oh and he was also under arrest so the cops were coming with him.\n\nAbout 15 minutes later they roll the patient in. He was soaking wet, and was fully dressed in black clotheing (you can guess why he was under arrest). The story was they found him KO next to a ditch with his head in dog poop. \n\nSo I start doing my ABCDE routine (you know, airway, breathing, circulation) and when I got to checking his pain reflexes, I pushed my thumb firmly on the bone right above his eye (usually people don't like that). This man did not respond at all. The paramedic watched me and said mwaah, that's not going to work and demonstrated by slapping him HARD in the face twice. Again, no response. \nHe was also hypothermic because he had layed around soaking wet for quite some time.\n\nThe ER nurse assisting me proceeds by starting to cut his his clothes off of him, and then we noticed he had a t-shirt with text under his longsleeve. \nThe shirt said (in dutch so I need to translate): \"What the hell am I doing here?\"\n\nNeedless to say, we laughed our asses off :D",

        "text": "So I work at a small community hospital. We run into a little bit of everything in our area, because we don't live in the best area.\n\n\nAbout 35 minutes up the road is the big local Medical Center. In about 30 minutes in the other direction is when the larger hospitals near the state line. \n\nOne night I'm working on the second floor med/surg unit, which happens to be on the same floor as our main lobby entrance. Now it's about 9 p.m. At this point so anyone who comes in goes to ER.\n\nWe get one of the housekeeping and maintenance guys running up to the desk telling us that there is a woman in the lobby who is falling down and that she's a patient.\n\n\nFair enough, it happens.\n\n\nA couple of us go running around the corner to the lobby to see what all the fuss is about. There's a woman in street clothes lying on the floor screaming her head off. She's also wearing a hospital ID bracelet.\n\n\nWe grab a wheelchair and start trying to get her into it. Interesting thing to note at this point, is that she's probably in her early 20's even younger than I am.\n\n\nNow this woman probably weighs 110 120 pounds. And yet it takes three of us to get her into the wheelchair, because she's acting such a damn fool. \n\nShe's screaming crying won't lock your knees won't push up absolutely doing nothing to help us. But eventually we get her into the wheelchair that she keeps trying to make a head dive out of.\n\n\nNow, I have a lot of patience. But I don't have that much. So we get her on to the elevator, wheel her into the ER registration, and park her there.\n\n\nThe rest of this story I picked up later as I was loitering around the ER.\n\n\nAfter she got parked at the reg desk, she pissed off the registrar by carrying on about how her stomach hurt instead of answering important questions like \"What is your name?\"  \nThe she said she was going to throw up. Registrar hands her an Emi-bag. She proceeds to make 'horking' noises at the desk with the bag in her lap.  \n\"If you throw up, it will be in that bag. Or else.\"\n\n\nOnce they got as much as they could on her, they stick her in a corner in her wheelchair while they try and clean out some rooms. It's Saturday night, and the 'er is hopping.\n\n\nJane Doe decided she didn't feel like waiting.\n\n\nShe got up, walked into the hall, and waited until the radiology tech walked through the coded doors. And followed him in.\n\n\nNow let's take a little narrative break here. Notice how I just called her Jane Doe? Remember me mentioning that she already had an armband?\n\nThat's what her armband from the Regional Medical Center up the road said. Date of admission? Same day.\n\nHer 'friend' who brought her, dropped her off in the nice dark main lobby instead of driving her around the corner to the ER, eventually came back with a McDonald's bag. She explained to us that she'd been admitted to the ER there, but that they were so busy she demanded to be brought to ours instead.\n\n\nBecause apparently it's on Saturday at regional. It's a Tuesday or something where we are.\n\n\nSo back to our story.\n\n\nThis women that acted like such a gumby that it took two nurses and a tech to get her in a wheelchair. Got up. And walked. Into the proper.\n\nDr. B said whatever. Stick her in a room if we have one. And shut the door.\n\n\nFast forward a bit. Maybe 20 minutes.\n\nShe's in a room and mostly in a bed. I was back in the ER at this point (legitimately I might add) dropping off some saline flushes. So when I say almost in the bed, I mean as much out of the bed as in, because this chick is pulling some seriously excorsist like crazy crap.\n\nShe's folding in half backwards, slamming her arms and head into the siderails, all the while continuously emitting this unearthly howl that climbs up and down the range of human hearing.\n\n\nOne of our more devoutly religous nurses can't decided if she needs to start reciting The Lord's Prayer and Hail Marys or simply slap the devil out of her.\n\n\nThe dropped off my fluids, called my floor and told them I was going to enjoy the show. They were slow so they didn't care.\n\n\nHer friend was back at this point, and explained that she was pregnant. We perk up thinking that maybe this is a legit medical complaint, ectopic pregnancy, instead of demonic possession. \n\n\nNope. Friend says she goes a 'little' crazy when she's pregnant. This is her third pregnancy.\n\n\"Where's the other two, I wonder?\" Says Dr. B to Awesome Guy Nurse.\n\n\"With their Lord and Father, Satan,\" replies AGN.\n\nI can only half remember the rest of the nonsense that came out of our mouths, but if I can recall any of the better ones, I'll edit them in.\n\n\nWe decided that she was a complete risk to herself at this point, apply 4 point soft restraints and pad tg e siderails. Again. Because she won't stop slamming her head into them.\n\n\nThen the police arrive.\n\n\nOur security guy is an amiable old codger who also works part time for both the county and the city PD. He keeps his radio on at all times. He heard an interesting story complete with description and recommended they send a patrol car up to the hospital. For a free coffee you know.\n\n\n\nWell, they took one look at her and arrest her on the spot. \n\n\nTurns out that she left the other hospital before Big City PD 1 can get their hands on her.  She's now trespassed off that hospital's property because she tore apart their ER. Something like 35k in damages.\n\n\nAnd Big City PD 2 (where I live) was on the look out for her as well, because she had several warrants out for her arrest. One for tearing up a doctor's office. \n\n\nThe only reason they got hold of her was because we tied her to the bed. When PD showed up, she tried to escape. They cuffed her hands, wheeled the stretcher to the paddy wagon, cut the ankle restraints, and tossed her in.\n\nI went back to my floor with a big grin.\n\n\nIt took an hour from the time she arrived to the time she was carted off. The hospital was almost creepy silent after she was gone.\n\n\nTl;dr Satan and his bride are expecting. And the popos always get their man.\n\n(From my phone, apologies for typos) m",

        "text": "So, my boss (Dr. M) works at two hospital clinics. \n\nHospital X is a public, government administered hospital. They will accept 99% of medical insurances, including Pain-in-the-ass-insurance-we-all-hate-cause-they-never-pay-out-to-the-doctors. This is the government provided insurance, so the hospital has to take it.\n\nAlso, because Hospital X is a public hospital, and takes almost every insurance, A LOT of people go to it. Appointments at the neuro clinic are for October at moment.\n\nHospital Y (where I work at) is a private hospital, where each doctor decides what insurance they'll take in their practice (doesn't apply when they work in the emergency room, since there every insurance is taken). Appointments at this clinic are only 4 weeks away, as opposed to several months.\n\nSo, we have a patient here with Pain-in-the-ass-insurance. Due to the fact that Dr M hates it, in this clinic he doesn't take it. So, this patient (Far Away Lady, FAL) has to pay cash for her kid's visit ($150 per visit). \n\nFAL lives far away (but close to Hospital X), and doesn't seem to be in the best economic position. Truthfully, this could have been managed, and had she aqsked for it, a payment plan would've easily been created for her. Instead, she thinks we should allow her to cheat the system.\n\nSee, she came here because she couldn't/didn't want to (diagnosis isn't serious) wait four months for an appt at Hospital X. So, here she is, and she starts moaning about how far this hospital is from her house, and how she can't believe we're charging her so much, instead of taking her insurance. I feel kinda bad for her and am about to offer her a payment plan, when she gets kinda snarky.\n\nFAL: Why can't you just take my insurance? I can't be paying for these appointments!\n\nMe: Well, I'm sorry for that. Dr M does take it in his other clinic at Hospital X\n\nFAL: Yeah, but I'm not waiting that long! And this place is sooo far away! Do you know all the troble I had to go through to get here? Hospital X is just 20 minutes from my house, and yet I had to come all the way here!\n\nMe (thinking, And why is this my fault...?) If the charge-\n\nFAL: Why don't you just take my insurance?\n\nMe: Sadly (NOT!) this office isn't subscribed to it.\n\nFAL: But M takes it in Hospital X!\n\nMe: Yeah, but not here. Private practice lets him choose which insurances he'll take\n\nFAL: But if he takes it over there, why won't he take it here!\n\nMe: That is his choice ma'am. If you want him to take it, you'll have to go to Hospital X. Otherwise we could-\n\nFAL: Well, if he's in charge of both clinics, can't he see me here, but bill the insurance from there- like he saw us there?\n\n*Record scratch*\n\nMe: What?\n\nFAL: Yeah! I could come here- even if it's soooo far, and you could just tell the insurance I went there, so they'll cover the visit\n\nMe: That's not how insurances work. \n\nFAL: What's the big deal?! It's the same doctor!\n\nMe: That would be fraud, ma'am. That is a government run hospital. Meanwhile this is a private clinic. So, the insurance would pay the hospital, not the doctor. Then, because the hospital has no record of a visit, it would raise red flags... Cause, insurance fraud.\n\nFAL: That doesn't make any sense\n\nMe: Um... well, that's how it is...\n\nFAL: So unfair!

I'm always at the office, Monday through Friday, 3-8 pm. Fridays are billing/stocking/errand days, so while I am here (answering phones and giving out info too), the doc isn't, as the actual clinic is not open.\n\nOk, so, today (Friday) I'm calling next week's patients to verify that they're still coming to their appointments. All is chilling and well, till I'm talking to the mom of one of next Thursday's patients. She can'tmake it, and needs a new appointment. I tell her I'll gladly reschedule her kid for the Thursday after next (a week after their original appointment). This doesn't fly with her: (ThursdayMom, TM)\n\nTM: That won't do. I can't wait that long, because her daddy's leaving town that week, and he has to be there too. \n\nMe: Well, ma'am, we're all full right now, so that's the closest appointment I have at the moment. You could call me next Friday, to see if someone has cancelled for that Monday or Tuesday.. But at the moment all I can offer you is the Thursday after next. Otherwise, you have the spot for next week's Thursday at four.\n\nTM: But I have a party that Thursday at six! If we go, we'll be late for the party! We can't miss it.\n\nMe: [irked that her emergency is a goddamn party, way to prioritize, lady] There's nothing I can do at the moment ma'am. We have a strict no-walkins policy, unless they are certain specific cases-\n\nTM: But why don't you just put me on next Friday?! That way her daddy can be there too!\n\nMe: Sorr-\n\nTM: It won't cause an issue. If you put us in on next Friday we can go, her daddy can go, and I won't miss my party. \n\nMe: Sorry, but therereally isn't anything I can do. We don't see patients on Fridays.. You can either come this Thursday, or the 27th. \n\nTM: Ugh! But you're there today, and today is Friday!\n\nMe: But the doctor isn't... I can't give you an appointment for a day when the clinic won't be open, since Dr M isn't here on FRidays.\n\nTM: Well, just leave my appointment on. I'll *try* to make it, even if we'll be late to the party. If I show up early, can you see me first, so I won't be late?\n\nMe: Sorry, ma'am, but it wouldn't be fair to the patients with earlier appointments if I let you cut first. \n\n TM: Fine... I'll call you. \n\n",

I have good days where I can move around, drive, do chores, etc. However, I have bad days where I can't get out of bed let alone drive a car. My legs sometimes go numb on bad days and that's never a good thing while driving. I've had this condition slightly for ten years and severely for the last five. I've seen everyone possible about it and tried just about every treatment. I've come to the point of just trying to manage it instead of cure it.\n\nTo that end I've been seeing pain management specialist. After my favorite one moved to a different place they slotted me to a guy I didn't like. So I decided to switch hospitals and providers.\n\nSo here is where I need advise as to if this is normal or not. My new doctor, who I have been seeing for about six months now, didn't even give me a cursery physical exam before trying to shove drugs on me. I was already on one pain med and he kept wanting me to take stronger drugs or higher doses. At one point I knew that I could ask for any reasonable dose of any pain medication, methadone for example, and he would give it to me without question. It was like I was the doctor and could proscribe for myself and he would care. That is, until I asked him to take me off the meds. Than he was very upset and tried to change my mind, despite the horrible side effects I had had. It seemed like as long as I was on pain meds he didn't have to actually help me. All while charging almost $300/hr. If we hadn't been in a hospital I would have suspected I was in a pill farm.\n\nTL;Dr: Are most pain doctors outrageous pill pushers that let you self prescribe?",

Because I don't have anything available before it. Otherwise, I would've offered that spot to you. I'm sorry if you feel a month is too long a wait, but considering his other practice is giving out appointments six months from now, I'd say one month is pretty good deal. No, no matter how much you moan and groan I can't make an exception. Exceptions are made for emergency/unique/life threatening conditions, and what you have doesn't qualify as one of those. I've been here for more than two years, I know what qualifies as an exception worthy condition, and yours does not. No, I will not let you talk directly to Dr M regarding this because it's my job to give appointments, and frankly he's a very busy man. No ma'am/sir, you can't just drop by- We do NOT take walk-ins, unless they are the above stated conditions. You don't have one of those, so you can wait. No, insulting me won't get you special treatment, and it most certainly will not make me budge. I'm the Queen of the Agenda, granted full powers of Appointments, as decreed by Dr M, so if I say no, I mean no. Oh, you showed up anyway- I already said no, so you can go back home. I told you already we wouldn't make an exception for you. \n\nNo.",

        "text": "I worked for a while in a rather infamous hospital in a big city. My department was Immunology, which was really something of a catchall since it also served as overflow from Surgical and other departments. Most of the time I was at the desk, handing clerical things like filing and phone calls. The work came in waves - you'd either be doing everything, or doing nothing. The dullness of it was compensated for by the unpredictable events that let you walk home with a good story.\nOne of my deskly duties was picking up the phone that rang whenever patients pushed the call button on their beds. I would find out what they wanted, and notify their nurse/tech/appropriate staff member to handle it if it wasn't something I was authorized to do myself. It was very common for patients wanting pain medicine to call over and over, every two or three minutes, even though there was nothing I could do to speed up their busy nurses. However, this guy was the strangest repeat caller that I ever encountered.\nNot a full minute after I walked on duty that first day, the phone rang:\n\nMe: Nurses' station, how can I help you?\n\nPatient: Uh, yeah, can I get some cereal or somethin' in here?\n\nMe: Sure, I'll let someone know.\n\n\nHis nurse walked by then, and I relayed his patient's request to him. The nurse just rolled his eyes and kept walking, which was odd. I soon understood why. Not a full minute later...\n\n*phone rings*\n\nMe: Nurses' station. How can I help you?\n\nPatient: Cereal. I want some fuckin' cereal!\n\nMe: I let your nurse know. He'll get back to you on that soon.\n\n*hang up*\n\nAgain, less than a minute later:\n\n*phone rings*\n\nMe: Hi, Mr. [name], are you still waiting on that cereal?\n\nPatient: AW HELL YEEEAH!\n\nMe: I let them know already.\n\nPatient: AND MILK!\n\n*hang up*\n\nAnd he *kept calling*. I don't mean once or twice - I mean literally dozens of times. It got to the point so that I passed the time by keeping a record of time elapsed between his calls. It averaged 14 seconds.\nMy boss walked by soon after and heard the phone ringing.\n\n\"Is that room 12?\" she asked.\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"He'd better not be wanting any more food! My lord, that man has cleared us out up here! You know we started the weekend with two full drawers of graham crackers for patients who just got allowed solids, and in the last two days he's eaten every last one! Just ignore him.\"\n\nAnd so I did, though he continued to call every 12-25 seconds. Every few minutes I would actually pick up to briefly check on him, but it was always for cereal, and cookies, and milk, and candy. Eventually, he got tired of being ignored. He stopped calling. And then a bloodcurdling scream came out of room 12.\nI was momentarily frozen with shock, but none of the other nurses reacted. One of them rolled her eyes and said, \"That's what he does when he isn't getting enough attention.\"\n\nShe went into his room and business was as usual, until we heard her yell: \"MR.[NAME], YOU PUT YOUR CLOTHES BACK ON RIGHT THIS INSTANT.\"\n\nAnd so it continued for the rest of the day - calls five times a minute, screams and expletives when he wasn't being doted on. Eventually we called in a sitter to keep him calm, and she ended up leaving, exasperated, after only three hours and told us to call someone else.\n\nThis man stayed for two weeks. *Two weeks.* His behavior never improved, and he never stopped eating the damn graham crackers.\n\n\nTL;DR: Be nice to your nurses - you have no idea what they put up with every day.",

        "text": "I'm just discovering the 'TalesFrom' Reddits and these are amazing stories. While I don't have my own stories in the medical field quite yet, I wanted to share some stories from my dad who was an ER doc for a while in New Jersey.\n\nStory 1: \nUsual Friday Night/Saturday Morning, which means nothing in the ER. Patient brought in. Poor bastard was severely intoxicated. So drunk, it was a miracle he was still conscious, let alone alive. Now of course alcohol loosens all those pesky inhibitions, so this guy's carrying on. He's shouting about this and that sports team, the government and everything in between. He's harassing the nurses and generally just being a drunk asshole who might die from alcohol poisoning. So my dad gets recruited as one of the newer guys to be the one to settle Mr. Drunk down.\n\nDr. Dad: Hey buddy, cmon. Sit down and be quiet for pete's sake.\nMr. Drunk: Look asshole, just because you own this bar doesn't mean you tell me what to do!\n\nBoom! And just like that Mr. Drunk is out like a light.\n\nStory 2: \nMidday, random day of the week. Still summer, my dad's still a new guy down in the ER. A big family comes in. Mom, Dad, and couple of Aunts, Uncles, and Cousins. All these folk have random burns on any exposed skin, thankfully none of the burns being severely life threatening. Some of the other doctors start to patch up the poor family while my dad's sent to get a case history from these folk and figure out how they all got burned. \n\nAfter about fifteen minutes, my dad pieced together the following story: The family lived in an old dump of a place, and like all old places, they easily get infested with cockroaches. Especially with a huge family crammed inside. So this bright sunny day, they decided it'd be ideal to spray the whole interior with roach fogger. And that's where the smart decisions ended. Rather than going and doing something outside the house filled with cockroach poison, the whole family just went back inside like nothing had happened. Fortunately, this is an amusing story rather than a tragic one where a family dies from insecticide poisoning.  Once inside, the family went about their normal business, but it was highly short-lived, because one of the uncles was a smoker. Yes, this grown man decided to light a cigarette in a building that they had just sprayed with an aerosol-based cockroach poison. Thus, the whole area went up with a bang.\n\nTL;DR 1: Drunk Guy thinks he's still in the bar while he's in the ER.\nTL;DR 2: Family sprays house with cockroach poison and stays inside. Uncle lights cigarette and house explodes.",

He has finally had his head scanned, and has been sitting there for hours waiting for someone to check the result. He’s fine. They put a backslab on the ankle and leave him for the bone doctors. \n\n03:30 - Man comes in with scalp lacerations. He is extremely confused and abusive, but is it because of the alcohol or because of a brain injury? We aren’t sure, scan him. \n\n03:40 - Same story. Scan him. \n\n03:45 – Same fucking story. A woman this time. \n\n04:20 - I walk out into the pit; “Dooooctor” a man lying in the stretcher moans. I tell him I’m not a doctor. “Man, the pain is too much”. I pick up his notes to see if he has been given any pain relief. I get a tiny splinter of glass through my finger from the broken windshield he went through. My finger is bleeding, not good. I squeeze the glass out and pour alcohol disinfectant over the wound. I ask the senior if it’s ok, is it an HIV risk, and she reassures me its not. I double check he is HIV negative anyway.  \n\n04:50 - The drunks have filled the pit. They all need a special mix of what they call “Rocket Fuel”, and so everyone is working together to get the drips up. My guy is shouting abuse at me as I talk to him. He pisses his pants and laughs at me. I try and get the needle in, but he thrashes around and starts hitting me. I back off, breathe, and come back in for another go. This time he grabs me tries to bite a chunk out of my cheek, only barely missing. I explode. JUST FUCK OFF I yell, and slam him to the bed angrily. The other doctors see I’ve lost it and jump in to help. With two on the legs, two on the arms and one on the chest and head, they eventually get the line in. After it’s all over one of them comes over to me, pats me on the shoulder. “Don’t worry about it man. It happens.” I’m gutted. \n\n05:00 – 07:00 – I only recall bits and pieces. I remember at one stage just standing there freezing cold, trying to unclog the blood from my zipper so I could zip up my hoodie. I remember a guy who had been pistol whipped, and the end of his nose was hanging off. They told me to sew it back on, but I was saved by the plastic surgeon who thought it was a bit beyond me. I remember trying to sneak a nap in the bereavement room – the place where they tell bad news to the family. They have the nicest couches in there. I got interrupted by a bereaving family. “I’m sorry” I mumble as I stumble out. \n\n07:00 – End of the night. I’m falling asleep on my feet, but I still need to go and help on the wards. I walk around in a daze, listening to chests, taking blood and filling out forms, checking blood results.  \n\n08:30 – Middle of ward round, one of the interns gets called away. A heavily pregnant lady had gotten 30% burns the night before and had been admitted. Now it sounds like she might be having contractions. “Can you cover for me, just hope that it’s Braxton-Hicks!” Turns out they are, and she ends up delivering a few days later on the ward. [When I left the unit they were still treating her burns.]\n\n11:30 - A little boy of 10 years old is on the ward. He is deaf-mute with no family, just a concerned passerby who brought him here because he had been having seizures on the street. No one has any idea what is wrong, so Trauma take his care over. Over the next few days he gets put through the medical wringer with everything investigation they can do, many of them painful and invasive. He sits there in the corner of the ward, drooling, staring at you as you walk past with nothing behind his eyes. It’s heartbreaking and unsettling. Today it’s a lumbar puncture. We give him some panadol and ketamine, then one of the interns hold him while I put the needle in.\n\n13:00 – I finally walk out the front doors, blinking in the crisp sunlight. Somehow I make it to the shuttle bus, and 30 minutes later I am shaken awake by the driver. “You are home now, you sleep at home, not here” he smiles.\n",

        "text": "*This tale from medicine was sent in to our student magazine by a student fresh back from an elective in Africa - upon finding this subreddit I had to share it. It is exactly as recieved, but with any identifying details removed to ensure anonymity of the hospital, the student and the student's university. Enjoy.*\n\nHaving been originally sucker-punched into medicine during high school by reading the romantic and adrenaline-laced tales of war doctors, I wanted to get my own taste of trauma during my elective. I chose to go to [a very large hospital in a developing country].\n\nIt was mental. As an overseas student, you essentially function as a doctor because of the huge patient load. \nDuring one of my 30 hour shifts, I tried to chronicle events, the patients I saw and helped resuscitate, as best I could. \n\n07:00 - I walk through the front doors. The scent of the Pit hits me – old foot sweat, fetid pus and a special ingredient I still haven’t been able to identify. I walk through the resus bay on my way to the doctor’s room, past a young child half inside a morgue bag, still warm from dying of burn injuries. The relatives are grieving around him, while arguing with hospital staff about whether they can harvest the organs. \n\n07:01 - “There you are, get some gloves on and get this guy stitched up.” He has been stabbed in the face with a broken bottle, big deep cuts across his forehead and face. “You sure?” I ask – pretty sure this guy would be sent straight to Plastic Surgery at home. “Yeah it’s fine, just make sure to stay away from his eye when you do the eyelid, and line up his ear and eyebrow properly.” I grab the suture pack and get to it. The scissors don’t cut, the forceps don’t grab. It’s like knitting with a knife and fork. \n\n07:45 - 6 year old boy has been hit by a car on his way to school. His left thigh is swollen to the size of a party balloon – he has broken his thigh bone. He comes in gritting his teeth, not a sound. “What a brave little kid” I think as I help cut off his school uniform, to reveal a worn-out Batman costume he was wearing underneath. It’s only when we have to cut that off too that he starts to cry. \n\n08:20 - A taxi has gone through the wall of a house, killing the girl sleeping inside. The front passenger died on the scene. The driver is comatose. We rush him to the resuscitation room, put a tube down his throat to let him breath. We put a catheter in – he is urinating blood. The FAST scan of his chest and abdomen shows large amounts of free fluid inside. We take him to theatre, but it’s too much, his liver, spleen and kidneys are in pieces. He dies on the table. \n\n10:00 - I come back to the Pit, and there is a bit of calm. One of the interns tells me that when I was in theatre a lady came in who had mangled her hand in a kitchen sink waste disposal “Mate her hand was hanging onto her wrist by nothing but biltong”. I start to see some non-urgent patients.\n\n10:05 - a chap with headaches after being beaten in the head with an iron pole 3 days before. I ask the important questions, examine him to rule out the serious things, then tell him that a few headaches probably are to be expected, and send him home with pain relief. \n\n10:30 - A man with a wedding ring trapped on his sausage size swollen digit after being cut on the finger 5 days before. I anaesthetize his finger and slice off the ring with the nifty tool. \n\n11:00 - A guy with a swollen left eye and a bleeding eyebrow. I ask what happened. “My girlfriend tried to bite off my eyebrow.” The mind boggles. I probe the story further – turns out the same girlfriend bit off his ear in 2009, he had to have a new one reconstructed. Human bites are notoriously filthy, so he needs antibiotics for a while. As I’m cannulating him I tell him that the relationship might not be too healthy and its time to move on. \n\n11:30 - A lady has spilled acid all over her lap, with deep dry burns across her thighs and buttock, maybe 15-20% total body surface area. Nasty, but not life-threatening. Not much we can do for her until the chemicals wear themselves out – they don’t have any neutralizing stuff here. I send her to the ward. \n\n12:15 - A middle aged man who has sliced his palm and fingers with a circular saw. I test all his nerves and tendons – his hand is still working fine, it’s just bleeding and a little mangled. I stitch him up carefully, and it looks nice afterwards. He is happy. “I’m glad I got white doctor” he grins. I tell him for the umpteenth time that no, I’m still a student. He is still glowing.\n \n13:15 - Lunch. A treasured 15 minutes. \n\n13:30 – A man comes in after being dragged behind a car by an angry horde after being caught in the act of a crime – #mobjustice. He has degloving injuries to his thighs &amp; buttocks, and his scrotum has been torn away, leaving his testicles completely exposed. \n\n14:15 - I’m walking to the radiology room to follow up some scan results. I am stopped by a man in the waiting room. “Hey doctor” he calls. Look friend, I’m busy. And I’m not a doctor, sorry. “Quick boss, quick.” Ok fine, what is it? “I’ll trade you gun for your stethoscope.” [Gestures towards butt of gun sticking from his belt.] I hurry away.  \n\n15:30 – The pit is busy. I’m trying to help out seeing the non-urgent cases, and notice the homeless man I noticed a little earlier is still here. He has wet gangrene of both his legs, he stinks, and he is drunk. No-one in general surgery wants anything to do with him. The waiting line is long, there are other patients to see. He eventually gets bored, drops his pants, and starts playing with himself vigorously. STILL no-one bats an eyelid, and he is left there vigorously jacking it for at least half an hour before a nurse decides to step in. \n\n\n16:30 - A young man with the first gunshot of the night. The first shot grazed his arm, the second went through his thigh, in-and-out. He is stable and not bleeding much, so we x-ray him. The bullet has smashed his thigh bone apart, he will need surgery. We put him into traction and pass him onto the orthopaedic surgeons. \n\n17:15 - A 16 year old kid trapped in a house fire. Many people living  here have rudimentary shacks for homes, and rely on open fires for warmth. Winter is just kicking in, which means more and more fires, and more accidents. This poor lad had 60% partial-full thickness burns. As we do the immediate resuscitation, I can hear the senior doctor talking angrily with the Burns Unit over the phone. They won’t take him – 60% is their cut-off. She slams the phone down. “Cover up the burns, keep him warm, and then move on” she sighs. He died later in the evening. \n\n18:00 - Old guy with a massive inguinal hernia comes in with burns all over his football-sized scrotum. Another open fire. This time the Burns Unit take him. \n \n18:50 – A man stabbed in the temple region a few hours before. He has a sore neck, severe headaches and has lost consciousness a couple of times. This is bad. I can’t feel a fracture in the skull, but he is tender over the c-spine. Neck collar him, and order the brain scan. \n\n19:40 - A middle aged guy who got kicked in the nuts a couple of weeks ago now comes in with pain and swelling in his scrotum. I can get above it, it’s not a hernia. He gets an ultrasound scan, which shows the testicle has died and is now festering. I call the surgeons and they book him in to cut it out. \n\n20:40 - I’m eating dinner, and watching the news with some other docs. Nelson Mandela is still sick in hospital, and the whole nation waits - everyone is hoping he hangs in there until his 95th birthday. \n\n21:15 - A guy who got knocked over by a car, twisting his ankle and hit his head. Can’t remember the incident, remembers waking up to his concerned mates standing over him. Scan the brain. I fill out the forms and go to talk to the radiologist, who sighs, signs, and says “Ok sure we can scan him, but he’s gonna be waiting for a while.”\n\n22:00 - A car hijacking. The three assailants chucked a rock through his window, and then forced opened the door. Guy comes in with stab wounds to his palms from where he tried to defend himself from their knife. He gets yanked out of the car and yelled at while he’s on the ground. He manages to get up and start sprinting away, but they catch him and put the boot in. He has his front teeth kicked in, a sore neck, painful ribs and spine. His ankle is badly swollen. His head is fine and pupils are reactive. My clinical discernment out the window, I just order him a whole bunch of xrays for wherever he is hurting.\n\n22:40 – A guy comes in who has been taken an axe to the face. His parotid gland is handing out, and is squirting arterial blood. “Asher, put some stitches in there quickly to stop the bleeding, I’ll be there soon.” I put one in. That bleeder stops, but it starts up two more; it’s like a Hydra. I eventually give up and get the registrar, he gives it a shot, but no luck. By now he has lost about a litre of blood, and his whole face has swollen up to the size of a grapefruit. “Ok let’s get him to theatre.” We go and quickly write the forms, do the phone calls, and come back. He has gone, just up and left to no-one knows where. He almost certainly died on the streets just outside the hospital.  \n\n23:30: “STAB CHEST, LETS GO”. A man has been stabbed just above his heart, and he is deteriorating fast. Everyone runs in. Get the airway, get intravenous access, take an ABG, put in a catheter. He’s still crashing, his oxygen saturation is going down. His neck veins are distended, his heart sounds are distant, and his blood pressure is in his boots. Unwavering, the consultant steps up, grabs the scalpel and slices open the chest; with what looks to be a hammer and chisel he cracks open the ribs. Blood splashes out all over the doctor’s scrubs as the pressure is released, and there it is; the man’s beating heart is laid open to the air. I’m dumbstruck, it’s unreal. I can see the purple lung pumping up and down on the other side. They start giving him blood but it’s for nothing, there is a hole in the heart and it’s all leaking out. They book him for theatre but it’s academic. I hold the heart between my hands as it beats slower and weaker. He dies. \n\n00:05: “GUNSHOT CHEST”. It’s a young guy covered in blood, brought in by the paramedics. I drop what I’m doing and run over with the other students and doctors. Looks like it has gone straight through front to back and out through his shoulder blade. The bullet has torn through his right lung, deflating it, but aside from that he is ok. He is struggling to breath so they give him morphine to calm him down, and pump him full of oxygen. “Your first chest drain for the night.”  \n\n00:30: “GUNSHOT CHEST”. Almost a carbon copy of the previous guy, shot front to back through the right lung. Same drill, put in the chest tube. He does well, too. There is a row of stationary bikes on the ward where the guys with chest drains all do their time in the next few days after their injuries, an they usually go home in a a day or two if their injuries are uncomplicated. \n\n01:20 - The drunk people start rolling in. Young lady was in the back seat during a car accident, and is in serious pain. She is making a big fuss as the paramedics pull her from the stretcher to the bed; obviously stressed out and frustrated at the endless stream of intoxicated people they have seen tonight, they are shouting at her to keep calm and cooperate. She gets put on the bed, and I look at her legs – one of them is shorter than the other and rotated inwards. “Stop pulling her hip, I think it’s dislocated!” I urge. They back off, and wait for the xrays. Sure enough, the hip joint ball has popped out and is buried somewhere in her buttock. “Good spotting” says the doc working with me, and I mentally high-five myself. \n\n01:45 - A guy in his mid teens has been clocked in the face with a brick. His whole side of the face is mashed, and he is struggling to breathe. They decide to intubate but they are struggling because there is something in the guy’s mouth. After some poking and prodding they realise what is happening – the brick broke the eye socket so badly that the orbit has fallen through the bottom into his oropharynx, and is blocking the doctor’s view of the throat. \n\n",

Also, everything that could have gone wrong, did go wrong that day.\n\nTowards the end of the day, just when we thought things could not get any more weird, a man turns up stating that he had a missed call from us and that he had looked the number up on the internet and that he had figured it must have been something important. So here he was. We asked him for his name and date of birth. No matches in our database. Checked his Medicare card: no matches. We asked if he had ever been before. He said that no he hadn't. We asked if he'd ever brought his family there before. He said that no, they didn't even know the place existed. At this point, my colleague told him that the call must have been a wrong number and not to worry about it. However, the patient insisted that no, if he'd been called by the doctor then it must have been important! She tried a few more times to convince him that there was no problem, but no, he insisted on waiting.\n\nWondering what to do, we scratched our heads thinking \"ok, this is really awkward.\" Eventually my colleague offers him a new patient form to fill out, which he completed and then sat down. The doctor then called him into the room and after three minutes the patient emerges having concluded with the help of a very confused doctor that nope, nothing's wrong and that he is perfectly healthy. He then thanked us for our time and left.",

        "text": "So I'm a firefighter by trade, but I'm currently getting my EMT certification, and past week I have been doing clinicals. Riding around with a Paramedic and all. It's pretty fun. Plenty of interesting calls, but this one in particular:\n\nWe get a call about an older lady having some chest pain. It's in a rundown part of town. Lots of poverty, crime, all that. When we get to the house, it looks as if the yard has not been mowed in months. Some of the weeds are up to my waste(I'm 5'10). There is no car in the driveway, and cats just everywhere. We knock on the door, and hear a faint call from inside. \"Who der?\" \"Paramedics ma'am.\" \"Oh, yall come on in.\"\n\nI open the door and am instantly smacked in the face with one of the most awful stenches I have ever endured. Now, I expect some of these places to smell. They are old homes, and a lot of the owners tend to not clean or simply can't. There are a lot of elderly people who have been left here by their children, and just don't have the strength or energy to maintain their homes. They shouldn't be living alone at all. This lady was no exception. \n\nWe make our way into the foyer, and I notice yellow stains all over the linoleum. I've cleaned up enough pee from my puppy to know what dried pee looks like, and that was it. It was everywhere. Before going any further, my partner and I both put on masks. We make it into the living room, and I am shocked. A little back story on me first. I was Crash Fire Rescue in the Marines with one deployment to Afghanistan. I dealt with amputations, bullet wounds, burns, vomit, you name it. Gore doesn't gross me out. This did.\n\nIn the middle of her living room was a pile, about a foot tall, maybe 2 feet around, of cat shit. Like, just swept into a pile and left there. It looked as if it had been there for weeks, even months. Well there's the smell I thought. My partner, doing his best to ignore it, goes up to her \"Hi ma'am, I'm Paramedic, and this is my partner Hobo. He's doing clincals. Is it alright if we take some vitals, and you can tell us what's wrong?\" \"Oh sure honey, come on over here\". She wheezed a little and coughed. Judging by the wetness of the cough, I figured she probably had some sort or respiratory infection. \n\nInside there were even more cats. Old ones, kittens, in-between. There were flies buzzing around, and roaches skittering around. There were enough on the pile o' poo to make it look as if it were alive and squirming. While my roommate listened to her breathing and such, I glanced around the room. I noticed that she either didn't turn on the lights or the power was out. I could see in the kitchen that the trash had not been taken out in some time, and there were empty soda cans, dirty dishes, clothes, etc just all over the place. The carpet was crusty from the cat pee. My skin was absolutely crawling standing in there. \n\nMy partner finishes the assessment and then starts to ask her if she lives alone. She does. She never sees her kids, her neighbor brings her food, and she can't afford to buy cat food, so they eat leftovers. He then tells her that part of the reason she got sick is most likely the cat poop that she keeps in the house. \"Well I can't buy litter, and I get tired moving around. It's a lot to clean up.\" \n\nIt was sad that her children let her live like that. From the sound of it, they never visit, don't call, and generally don't acknowledge her at all. Her husband had been dead for years and the only contact she got was from her neighbors. It took some convincing to get her to go to the hospital (she was very concerned about her cats). We let the doctor know the conditions, and hopefully someone will be able to get her out of those conditions. \n\nTL;DR: Old lady is left alone with her cats, can't clean, accumulates mountain of cat poop, gets sick because of it.",

But the worst thief of all is her sister.\n\nHer sister is 90 years old, but she got plastic surgery to look like she's 20. She moved to Hollywood to get a job in daytime TV. She is constantly getting surgery to change her face, and all of this is so she can marry men with Mustangs and get their money. \n\nOne of the times she needed to go to an audition, she came here and took the only dress this resident owns, the dress the resident wanted to be buried in. \n\nShe is also a drunk and hopped up on drugs. She married a black man who's on drugs. In fact, everyone in the building is on drugs. The resident figures she's on drugs too, but it's okay because her doctor gave them to her. Nowadays anybody can just go to a pharmacy and get whatever drugs they want.\n\nSo the resident's sister had to file for bankruptcy 3 or 4 times because she spends all of her money on drugs. Here's my favorite part.\n\nWe've stopped her from writing checks on the resident's account, but she's still getting the money. The resident's sister and her husband  slide under the building with a board every night. They dress all in black and dig a hole up through our floor and avoid the lasers and break into our safe. The resident knows because they go right under her room and she hears them.\n\n\nLet me tell you guys, we don't have lasers.",

I know I try my best to respectfully do right by the deceased and their survivors, but things can get complicated quickly. Especially with ::shudder:: family disputes. \n\nA few months ago, I got a call from a young woman informing me that her mother's remains would be picked up by \"Walterson's\"* funeral home, which I dutifully recorded. However, the home that came was \"Wyatt and Sons\". The rep convinced security and the girl on duty at the time that I had simply recorded the incorrect name, and took the body. \n\nFast-forward a few hours, to a call from the same young woman, in hysterics, wanting to know where her mother's body was. Uh-oh. \n\nAs it turns out, the deceased's family had different ideas on what constituted a proper send-out. The daughter picked the small but, ahem, untimely Walterson's. The aunt, who had no legal decision-making ability at all but what the hell, had called the larger and faster Wyatt and Sons' behind her niece's back. But while this was being figured out, I was stuck in hours of rushed damage control meetings getting threatened with all kinds of disciplinary action. \n\nIt worked out in the end; the larger funeral home was gracious enough to transport the remains to their competitor, and the daughter only got about 10 minutes of outraged local press coverage before the truth about the matter emerged. But it just goes to show, a hospital can't stop taking care of a patient even when they're beyond medical help. \n\n*names changed",

A little first aid here, medical advice there, drug information etc... what I DO get pissed about is people asking me outside of hours. And these people are usually friends or family.\n\n\"Oh, can you tell me why I have such a flaky scalp?\"\n\n\"Well, it could be anything from Psoriasis to eczema. Have you seen a dermatologist for an assessment on what treatment you need?\"\n\n\"No, I thought you would be able to tell me. Whats the point of having you otherwise?\"\n\n*look, I am so close to ripping out your jugular...*\n\n\"Well, any Pharmacist, or even doctor, will tell you to see a dermatologist, which doesn't cos-\"\n\n\"Can't you just give me the steroid cream that John Citizen uses? He says it cleared right up\"\n\n*I proceed, at this point, to walk out of the room*\n\nI am **NOT** a free and all knowing dispenser of medical advice. I can only help you with the information you give me. I stop drug interactions, not diagnose shit.",
