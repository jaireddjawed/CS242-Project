Being the \"hunter\" is suicided in the long term. How are you going to kill the other planets? Relativistic kill vehicles? Weaponized dyson spheres? If you uses relativistic craft than all it takes is one group of the target population surviving on a asteroid, triangulating your position, and shooting back. If you use a dyson sphere than suddenly everyone can see you and one of the other \"hunters\" will take you out. Remember, the \"hunters\" have to shut down the other planets instantly or this stops being a solution to the fermi paradox because we could see all the dead planets radios. \n\nIf anyone has thoughts I would be interested to hear them.",

This has made me quite depressed and fearful about the future. More importantly, though, when I hear about flat earthers, people who think NASA is lying about the moon landing, and other government conspiracies, I get angry. This anger has made paranoid about people  I meet in person. I  think \"is this person a Republican, do they think the world is flat?\" and I focus on that letting it consume me and I believe it's being reflected in how I come across. Worse, several cousins of mine are like this and I've stopped seeing them. \n\nWhat do you if close friends or family are Republicans and hold anti-science views? How do I not let it affect the way I come across it? How do you accept it and not let it eat away at my personality?",

I’ve seen them many times and they look very similar to a star but travel a fixed line and as it loses it’s reflection from the sun it disappears. \n\nWhat I saw today looked exactly like that however, it flashed as if it was tumbling. Completely un-visible at times. Most often it was a fixed brightness as a star is but it would become extremely bright as if it was facing the sun perfectly but it would do this like a lighthouse would look. Getting brighter then flash then goes back to its fixed brightness. \n\nI watched this object for over 50 minutes and it did not travel a fixed path like a star or satellite. It traveled in three different headings which led me to post this as I have no clue what this could be and it has left me wondering. \n\nThis just happened so the memories are fresh if anyone has any questions I’d love to figure this out.\n\nI attempted to catch it on video and many planes traveling (obviously) much lower had passed close by so I could use that as reference but so far it looks like all the footage is a bust. \n\nI am located in Clearwater, Florida and this object was in the northern direction close to 90 degrees up but tracked as low as about 50 degrees from the horizon. \n\nApologies for not knowing many helpful terms to use, I love the sky but I am not very educated on it.",

And when my aoul was comming out my neurons kind of vibrating in my head and before the process of leaving body was completed in my dream i woke up and during this i saw like white and blue light like staring directly into sun but in my dream .after another experience a dream like this but instead with a different story and in the last one it finally happened …\nas i go through the story of dream at some point i reached a black board and the gravity was shut down i was looking \nPrecisely at something that was written on black board and after that i saw  device with lenses i drawn into it (absorbed) and what happened was like a black hole ! it was surprising to me cause the only way possibly to experience a blackhole and survive  is to dream it .what didn’t know in my previous dream was that what would happen if my soul would completely get out my body in dream how things go in that point and here it is a blackhole . Some other things to mention is that dreams kind of make sense even though not full logically like when my alarm rings and i don’t wake up i dream of an alarm clock . so the main question is what is this (iam kind of curious) and my muscles were shaking during this dream and even after i woke up like pulling into this shredding black hole my hand just move on their own and do you know something like this or similar to this one ?",
