        "text": "I would like to preface my story by saying that I am a Brit. I am every bit as stereotypically awkward and anxious about slight misunderstandings as you might expect, and am often too polite (read: scaredypants) to correct small miscommunications in the course of a conversation with a stranger. I reason that I am unlikely to encounter them again, and as long as it's of little importance to the overall exchange, I can save them (and myself) the trouble.\n\nThe following recounts the time I was in too deep, and my cringing scarlet face became a permanent feature, for all I know.\n\nA few months ago, I was having trouble accessing my online account for $NetworkProvider. My Ex Partner had changed the login, main email, security questions etc. So I called customer service, and after some very thorough identity and security checks, they changed everything over to my info. Success! It took a long time to confirm my identity, but I was definitely comforted by that more than anything. Great experience, very satisfied customer. \n\nThey read out my new username and password, and asked me to log in while still on the line so they could make sure I could gain access.\n\nPause again for context... $NetworkProvider (I'm not sure if this is universal) has a separate login for Home &amp; Broadband and for Mobile. They also semi-recently bought out a smaller provider, and merged(?). However, the smaller provider's website is still up, nothing is functional, any click just redirects you to the new site (without saying what's happening), and sometimes, particularly on the mobile (tablet) version of the page, it will go back and forth. So when you submit the login on the new site, it will take you to an error message on the old site for no reason, then when you interact with that page, you'll be redirected to the new site's home page if that makes sense. It is also very inconsistent with the login pages, there are several versions, and it's pretty much a lucky dip. They all contain the same input fields, but with different layouts and menus. It's a complete shitshow, basically. There's no way to use the mobile (tablet) version of the site and do what you need to get done. \n\nSo I am asked to log in with my new details. I prefer to keep my phone to my ear when on a call, so I grab my tablet from beside me, open browser, type in url (of new site), select 'Home &amp; Broadband', enter login, submit. \n\n&gt; Me: \"Sorry, I appear to have been redirected to the old website, I'll just try that again.\"\n\n&gt; CS: \"Certainly, Madam. Let me know once you've logged in successfully.\"\n\nAttempt login again.\n\n&gt; Me: \"Now the fields have emptied and there's a message in red saying my username does not exist, can I just check again that my username is $username and my password is $password?\"\n\n&gt; CS: \"Yes, Madam. Your new username is $username, and your new password is $password. It is case sensitive.\"\n\nI try again, am taken to old site, try again, message in red, and once more...\n\n&gt; Me: \"I am certain that I have entered everything correctly, but I cannot log in.\"\n\n&gt; CS: \"Ok, could you type $url into your address bar, and make sure to select Home &amp; Broadband, not Mobile.\"\n\n&gt; Me: \"I assure you I have been, but I will try again.\" ... \"Still no luck.\"\n\nHis tone drops now, I can tell once he has finished (silently and very professionally) rolling his eyes he will begin the arduous process of explaining this process to somebody who reads the broadsheets by oil lamp and wonders how they get the pictures in the 50\" frame to move about. I don't envy him, I think I can see why he has chosen this route, even though I know it isn't necessary. For reasons above, I don't interrupt, I don't claim to know any more than he assumes at this time. I play along because maybe there *is* something I've missed and a step by step will solve the issue.\n\n&gt; CS: \"Ok, Madam. Could you please move the arrow to where it says 'http://' and click there.\"\n\nA little much, I think, but ok. For my first weak attempt to clear this up...\n\n&gt; Me: \"Actually, I am on the mobile site, my laptop is not working and I only have access to my tablet and my phone. But I am at the login page on $url.\"\n\n&gt; CS: \"Ok, you are on 'Mobile' right now? please click where it says 'Home &amp; Broadband'.\"\n\n&gt; Me: \"No, I am at the Home &amp; Broadband login but I'm just saying that I am browsing the mobile version of the site, so it looks different to what you've described, and the menu and options are different (etc).\"\n\n&gt; CS: \"... So click 'Home &amp; Broadband' for me...\"\n\nMy heart sinks.\n\n&gt; Me: \"Ok, yes.\"\n\n&gt; CS: \"Alright, now enter your username and password which are $username and $password.\"\n\n&gt; Me: \"Yep.\"\n\n&gt; CS: \"And now click where it says 'Submit'.\"\n\n&gt; Me: \"Yes... The same thing has happened.\"\n\n&gt; CS: \"Ok, Madam. Now I would like you to go again to the address bar where it says http, click on it, and type www.google.com.\"\n\nOh, hell no. No he did not just. I'm in too deep now, I've been playing along with the How To Internet 101 for a good few minutes, it's too late now. Anything I could possibly say would just be rude unless I keep playing along. \n\nI am very slowly and carefully directed to the login up to the 'click on Home &amp; Broadband' part.\n\n&gt; Me: \"Home &amp; Broadband is not an option on this page that you've directed me to. Nowhere does it say that. It's just the login fields, logo at the top and sitemap(?) at the bottom.\"\n\nRepeat the process ad nauseam (always through Google - clearly I can't be trusted to type in a url that's actually shorter than google.com). The login page is different almost every time, and at this point I am *really* feeling for this Customer Service guy. I know it's not easy having to ELI a single celled organism. We have been in this loop for a very long time. I feel like giving up and saying it worked, and going through the rest of my life without a landline or internet access. I know I'm not explaining the situation very well, but he doesn't seem willing to accept that it's the mobile (tablet) site that is barely functional, not me.\n\nFinally, he has an idea!\n\n&gt; CS: \"Can you open the web browser on your mobile phone, and go to $url?\"\n\nI put him on speaker and do as he says. It's perfectly smooth, I am logged in. The mobile (phone) site is as smooth, clean and *functional* as the app (which I didn't think to download beforehand - my bad). I feel a rush of so many feelings all at once, most notably relief that it's over and embarrassment that it happened.\n\nI confirm to him that it worked, and apologise profusely, and thank him. Though, I am not admitting fault here, I am not responsible for the mobile (tablet) site's poor design. I am, however, feeling very sorry for the poor guy who was forced through this ordeal alongside me. I can't believe this appears to be the first time he's had a customer call in who's having trouble with the mobile site, but whatever, it's very possible. We laugh, the call is ended. I scream silently into a pillow, experience some arrhythmia and a burning flushed face, and then get on with the rest of my day. \n\nThis ended up being such a long and terrible phone call, and it was completely unnecessary. I swear I'll speak up and never let anything like this happen again, but I don't believe myself. \n\n**TL;DR: mobile site doesn't work how anybody expects, I allow myself to be spoken to like I am the problem, it escalates, a simple solution is presented after far too long, poor customer service guy should be paid more for his patience (though perhaps not listening skills) and I am embarrassed as all hell about something that's nobody's fault (bar the lazy ass web developers behind this butt circus design).**",

        "text": "This is a quick story from this past weekend when I stopped by a pop-up Halloween store in my local mall. I worked retail for about 5 years off and on and I know how crazy things get around holidays, and what people with kids can get like around costumes. So I do sympathize with the people working but at the same time, being sober probably would have helped things go more smoothly.   \n\nI was in the store with my dad getting one small accessory and then jumping in line. There were about 4 people in front of me as this was the only register open, no problem it won't be too long. So it took maybe 5-8 minutes to get up to the register, not too long but felt much longer with shouting parents, creepy music, and a child who kept whacking me in the leg with a \"sword\". Whatever, I'm here now.  \n\nI get up to the register and immediately realize the cashier is high as a kite, it's a condition I recognize well from some of my friends. Bloodshot eyes, dazed smile, and the underlying smell of weed with lots of fruity perfume on top of it. I figure if this person can do their job I really don't care, so I put my headband on the counter. She looks at it and starts giggling and saying how cool it looks. Uh yeah, thanks, can we move on?  \n\nShe scans it, gets a price, I hand her my card, and she swipes it. The receipt begins to print and then stops. She calls to someone else in the store that the receipt printer is out of paper and to come help her. The other woman is obviously busy and seems flustered that she has to come help. She tells me while we're waiting that she wanted to see how longer after the pink shows up does the roll actually run out. So she knew what was coming and just felt like screwing up receipts for fun. When the supervisor gets up to us, she picks up a new roll of paper from...right beside the machine and stares at the cashier showing her its right there. She pulls the old roll out and puts the new one in, a literal 3 second job I have done a hundred times myself, and the rest of the receipt immediately prints. The supervisor pulls it off and says, \"You can just give her this part, it has everything except the header on it, it's all she'd need anyway\" and goes on her way.   \n\nI reach for the receipt and...she balls it up and throws it away. I'm confused and just standing there as she stares at the screen apparently searching for something. Finally she pushes a button and something else starts printing, she pulls it off and exclaims, \"I got a full one to print!\". Okay great, thanks. I reach for it again and she calls over her shoulder, \"I need help again, now I have a receipt but I don't know how to use it to make her pay.\"  Uh, what?? I told her I already paid her and she asks me if I really did. I'm about fed up at this point and ask her how I'd have a receipt printed if she didn't receive payment, to which she starts giggling and hands me the receipt. I asked for a bag and she gives me this pouting face and goes, \"What's the magic word???\" in this Sesame Street singsong voice, at which point I just grabbed my headband and left.  \n\nI mean, dear God. I don't care what you do on your own time but if it is impacting your ability to behave even somewhat appropriately and perform basic job duties...maybe you should reconsider. \n\nTLDR: marijuana is not a performance enhancing drug",

        "text": "I normally post in /r/TalesFromRetail, but last night I was grocery shopping and I have to share this with someone. It wasn't really a *bad* experience, just mildly...hmmm...not even irritating, exactly, since it benefited me, I suppose.  It's just irritating, as a retail worker, when other retail workers don't seem to know how their own store's equipment works. \n  \nWhile I'm shopping I see that there's a sale on 2 boxes of cereal that go very well with marshmallows, and, additionally, if you buy 2 boxes, you get a bag of marshmallows for free.  Yay!  \n  \nNow, I know that at my local grocery store, they have to key in the amount of the free item coupon by hand, it won't just scan and automatically recognize the item and take the price off. So I thought I'd be helpful, and I put the coupon physically on top of the marshmallows, and pointed it out to the cashier when she got to them \"so you can ring it in right away, since it's a free item coupon!\" She did not. The price on the marshmallows was 30 cents less than the \"maximum purchase price\" listed on the coupon.  When she gets to the end of the transaction, she scans the coupon and looks confused. Then she...scans the coupon and looks confused.  Then she...wait for it...scans the coupon and looks confused.  Then she keyed in the maximum purchase price of the coupon, and moved on to scanning the other coupons before I could correct her.  \n  \nIf she had been new, I may have not been surprised, but I've had her as a cashier a few times now.  Each time, I've had to swipe my card twice at the end of the transaction, because she pushes the wrong button on her side.  So, I guess, in retrospect, I still wasn't surprised.  And, really, it was only 30 cents in my favor, but still... Here I'm trying to be helpful, being a fellow night-shift retail drone doing some shopping on my night off, and all for nothing. I hope there isn't super detailed auditing done on coupons at their store, otherwise, she'll have to explain why I got extra money off my purchase. ",

        "text": "FIRST: I didn't expect this to get so long... Wow I can ramble. There's a TL;DR for those who don't want to read a novel.\n\n\n\nI lived in a small apartment complex with a few buddies of mine, and this apartment we shared was passed between our group of friends several times. I ended up leaving as I had the opportunity to live almost rent-free at my work site, which as a broke postgrad I couldn't turn down. I sat down with all the accounts that were still in my name, including-most importantly-the separate electric and water bills, and called all the companies and followed their procedures. Everything seemed cool.\n\n\n\n*6 months later...*\n\nI was finishing up work and sorting through the mail, a good task to leave for the end of the day since I was living on-site and all the personnel's personal mail was lumped in with the business crap. Annoying, but good way to kill time. \n\nI pay for all utilities and bit of rent directly from my paycheck, so I wasn't expecting to see a piece of mail from the power company for me. I open up and see that I owed nearly five hundred dollars in back pay for electric use. \n\nNaturally I assume that something meant for the current tenants -my friends- just made it's way to me, so I ring one of my buddies:\n\n&gt; Me: Hey dude, just wanted to let you know I got a bill from [power company]. \n\n&gt;Friend: Strange, I was doing the bills the other week and distinctly remember sending out a check for the utilities. You want me to double check that the payment went through?\n\n&gt;M: Nah man, I believe ya, I'll call them and get my name off the account. I probably forgot to do that one when sorting all the shit out from moving. \n\nWe chat and I get on with making a call to the power co., first gathering up all the paperwork I'd kept with me when I paid the last balance. \n\nI got on with the call and the following transpired, which was so fantastic that I will never forget it. I'll skip the robot and get to the account associate.\n\n&gt;Account Associate: Hi ft_chaos, thanks for your patience as I pull up your account here... I see that you're calling about an overdue balance on [account number] at [apartment address]? \n\n&gt;Me: Yep, good place, but I moved out about six months ago. \n\n&gt;AA: Well let's see what's going on... I see that the balance is currently at {~$500}. Typically when you move out you should call the power company before to make sure everything's okay.\n\n&gt;Me: Huh, I'm pretty sure I called in... But I'm not the current resident there, I haven't been for a while. \n\n&gt;AA: No problem, we can take care of that and switch them over, they'll just need to call in and confirm their contact and payment details for them to take over. How would you like to pay the remaining account balance before I begin the paperwork?\n\n...\n...\n...\nDammit. I'm going to be out five hundred dollars because I fucking forgot to make a goddamn phone call and for some goddamn reason I didn't know--\n\n&gt;Me: Why is this the first time that I've seen a statement? \n\n&gt;AA: We send a bill monthly which it doesn't look like has been paid for the previous six months. \n\n&gt;Me: Where have the bills been sent before? \n\n&gt;AA: [Messed up version of my work site address]\n\n&gt;Me: Yeah... That's not where I live. Close, but definitely not an actual address. I haven't seen those bills. \n\n&gt;AA: I'm reading through the notes the previous associate left and he wrote that you moved to [work site address] and--\n\n&gt;Me: So your notes mention that I called in and left the work site address?\n\n&gt;AA: I'm sorry?\n\n&gt;Me: I called in and said I was moving. \n\nHe gets it now. The five seconds of silence were fantastic. \n\n&gt;AA: ...oh, I guess you did...\n\n&gt;Me: *Just silence and smiles!* \n\n&gt;AA: Uhm... Well. I guess that the associate who previously handled this case forgot to actually remove your name from the account...\n\n&gt;Me: And wrote down the wrong forwarding address! \n\n&gt; *I'm bellowing laughter, and the guy starts chuckling too*\n\n&gt;AA: I wouldn't be surprised! Okay, I'm really sorry about all of this confusion, let me just get this all sorted out. Obviously this is an error on our end, so I again apologize for all of this hassle. \n\n&gt;Me: Not a problem! Wait... I don't have to pay the money, right?\n\n&gt;AA: No! No no no, you clearly did everything properly when leaving an account, so don't worry about the bill and we'll have everything sorted out. Thank you so much for your time, and again I'm so, so sorry. \n\n&gt;Me: No worries sir, don't have to pay, so I'm happy! \n\n&gt;AA: Have a great day [end of call blah blah blah survey blah blah blah]\n\nAnd then my friends got a five hundred dollar power bill. \n\n\n**TL;DR** I received an overdue power bill after I moved. Called into company, said I owed $500 and bill hadn't been paid for 6 months. I get anxious, ask about where bills were going, rep reads note on file saying I called in and informed the company of my move. I don't owe money, I didn't mess up! We laugh. Friends now owe the money. ",

        "text": "Hi all! I hope I am posting this in the right sub, please direct me to the correct one if I'm wrong. This is a story from a few years back, yet still blows my mind to this day. \n\nI was at a local chain supermarket in the self-scan checkout buying a few things. I'm finishing up my transaction when I hear the lady using the machine next to mine sighing and grumbling rather loudly. She was doing that hand-on-hip, obnoxiously sighing while looking around for an employee and trying to make eye contact with the other shoppers, inevitably to bitch about her machine not working. I look over and she's frantically trying to cram a gift card in the machine, but not in the card slot. No, she's trying to cram it into the cash acceptor. I watched her try a couple more times, because it was pretty amusing. I mean, the slot clearly had pictures of money and instructions on how to insert it, and the credit/gift/whatever card slot literally had green flashing arrows with instructions on how to swipe the card. The machine is beeping at her and the money slot is making some terrible noises, and each time she tried she would drop the card, which resulted in throwing her hands up, cursing, threatening to take her business elsewhere, calling the machine names, etc. \n\nThere are no employees to be found, so I stopped what I was doing to offer to help. Best decision I made all week. It went something like this:\nMe: hey, do you need some help with that?\nHer: oh my god, yes! Finally! I've been asking for help for at least half an hour now (asking who lady? And it had been five minutes, tops)!\nMe: okay, so you're trying to pay with this gift card, right? You need to swipe it in the card reader. It won't work in the cash acceptor, it just takes money, it can't read a card. \nHer: no, I have to put it in the cash one! It says so!\nMe: um, what? It says what?\nHer, shoving the card in my face: right here! It says TREAT LIKE CASH! \nMe, about to fall on the floor trying not to laugh: oh, that's not what that means. You still need to use the card reader. \nHer: WELL WHAT DOES IT MEAN THEN?!\nAt this point, an employee had walked over. I have never been happier to see a cashier. He walks up and asks if he can help her, so that I can get back to my own transaction. I thank him and walk back to finish paying, happy that I am still within earshot because this shit is great. \nCashier, after watching her try again to cram her card in the cash slot and throw her hands up in the air: here, let me help you. You just need to swipe it (he had picked the card up when it fell again and swiped it for her, finishing the transaction, thank god). There you go. \nHer: well, it shouldn't say to treat it like cash if you're not really supposed to!\nCashier: you are. It means if you were to lose your gift card, it wouldn't be replaced, just like if you lost money. Basically it means be careful. Like you would with money. \nHer: WOULDN'T BE REPLACED?! That's ridiculous. Money is always replaced! \nBy now, I was totally done buying my stuff but I couldn't bring myself to leave, it was getting too good. \nCashier, looking totally baffled: no, I mean like if you drop a $20 bill walking down the street. It's gone, no one replaces it, you don't call the federal reserve and demand $20. \nHer, gathering her bags to leave: YES I DO!\n\nAfter she was gone, the cashier just stood there for a few moments, like he was absorbing the level of ignorance he just witnessed. I thanked him for the laugh. I truly would not have believed a person could be so stupid had I not witnessed it myself. ",

However this one instance I got my pizza took it home ate the first slice only to discover they messed up my order. Instead of the hotdog stuffed crust I'd received a cheese stuffed crust (which I cant stand). So I took it back to complain but the person behind the counter was adamant that I didn't order the hotdog stuffed crust (I'm 100% sure that I did). After a few minutes he begrudgingly took back my pizza missing a slice and had a new one made with the hotdog stuffed crust. All is good.\n\nHowever next time I go there for a pizza maybe a week later or so I'm not exactly sure (again this happened a while ago) it was the same guy taking my order. So I made sure to be very clear with my order and at the end asking him to read it back to me...\n\nHe missed out the ham...\n\nI point this out to him and say \"you forgot the ham\" To which he again responds \"You didn't order ham\". At this point I'm thinking \"not this shit again at least the pizza hasn't actually been made yet this time\". \n\nBut then from a couple of meters away I hear another customer waiting for their order \"Actually they did order ham I heard them\".\n\nVictory was mine. I made no effort to hide the smugness on my face and he knew he was fucked. I thanked the other customer and didn't say another word to the guy taking down my order.\n\nI'm fairly certain he will have spat on my pizza many times but I came out the winner of our short lasting feud. I still go to that pizza place but I always ask them to read the order back to me now. Haven't had any further issues.\n\nI made sure to fully enjoy that pizza knowing it had everything I ordered on it.",

As this poor dude called us forward, my dad flips out at him, complaining that service took too long, we've been waiting for ages, etc. I saw part of this guy's soul die, and so pushed in front of my dad and got on with my business. As we were leaving the store, my dad sees the manager, talking to an employee. My dad marches up to him and starts complaining at him this time. \"The service in here is awful. We were just waiting here for fifteen minutes, while there's four or five people who work here just standing around, and there's only one desk open. It's unacceptable.\" At this point I've noted the fact that when we came in, the only person not on the desks was someone greeting people and helping them out, and as we were leaving, the only people were the manager and that same person. The manager looked confused for a second, then apologised to my dad. I gave him the best apologetic look I could and dragged my dad out onto the street. I said to him, \"Maybe you need to be trained to work at the desks, like in every other job?\" He scowled at me, not accepting he was wrong.\n\nNote: if this is in the wrong sub, please correct me.",

        "text": "I know kill me for making that pun.\n\nSo I was taking my brother to the optometrist one day. We got there 10 minutes after the appointment time and the receptionist looked like she wanted nothing to do with us. Like literally I've never felt so unwanted in a place. It was clear she gave no fucks. She stated that because we were so late (cut off 15 minutes after appointment time like with every other doctors appointment) and that we didn't fill out the paperwork for new patients that we can't be seen. This was all being said right next to a sign that says \"if you are more than 15 minutes late to the appointment, we reserve the right to cancel your appointment\" like literally the sign was all over her desk. \n\nSo I'm trying not to piss off major bitch here, but at the same time my brother missed school for this appointment and I'll be damned if he gets an unexcused absence or has to miss another day of school for another appointment. I made sure to look at the sign and look at my watch and say \"Oh I'm only 10 minutes late\" and just stand there waiting for my paperwork. And I could see the hatred in her eyes. She reluctantly gave me the paperwork and trying not to piss off major bitch, I speed through the paperwork so much so I got a hand cramp. I ended up handing in my paperwork in the next 5 minutes and after a few minutes we were called to the back. \n\nNow my brother has a learning disability where it takes him a while to understand the directions to something. For this instance he was supposed to only look straight at the balloon but he thought he was supposed to look at the scenery presented, so he made a point to look at everything including the balloon and the surrounding area. This set her off completely. As soon as he did that she called it quits she said \"I don't have time for this, if he's not going to do it right there's nothing I can do.\" and she started to pick up and leave but because of the previous reasons stated above I stood firm and kept going trying to make my brother understand what he needs to look at. After a few minutes (maximum of 5 minutes) going back and forth between trying to get through to my brother and trying to keep this lady from leaving, I try to calm myself down because he's getting excited and when he gets excited he can't comprehend as well as when he is calm.\n\nSo I get really quiet and I start talking to my brother and her and I'm trying to get through to both of them the importance of eyecare, I guess trying to get her to do her job without telling her to do it and get him to take this seriously but she starts screaming at me.\n\nMe: Now honey, you know getting an eye exam is very important to do. You've never had an eye exam before so it's especially important to do it now to make sure you don't have any eye problems like cancer. So I need you to ---\n\nMB: you know you don't need to say it like that. I'm trying my best but I can't force him to look somewhere. I've been here this entire time and he's not getting it. I don't have time to spend with one patient.\n\nMe: Excuse me but from the time we've stepped in all you've talked about is how you don't have time to spend with us- your clients. This is your job and you're telling me you don't have time to do your job?! Let me talk to the doctor!\n\nMB: I've been working here for 8 years, I know what I'm doing. If he's not going to do what he needs to than there is nothing I can do.\n\nMe: I don't care how long you've been working here or how much you know! I came here to see a doctor not a bitchy receptionist!\n\nMB: Fuck you! Get out! I'm calling the cops! \n\nMe: Fuck you too bitch and call the goddamn cops! \n\nAt this time I start going through some of the rooms I passed and for some reason the doctor was not in. We ended up grabbing our paperwork and leaving. \n\nWhile we were driving back home I was talking to my brother and within a few minutes he finally understood what his mistake was. If that bitch would have kept her damn mouth shut and did her job he could have understood alot sooner than being hounded by her. \n\nI wrote the most scathing Yelp review on the place and apparently this lady is notorious for being a huge bitch to her customers. I should have known the first time I met her when she ignored my dad the entire time when she realized he had an accent. \n\nTL;DR: Got cussed out by a receptionist for taking up her time.  \n\nAlso this is a repost since I fudged up the title.

Our house ended up not getting hit, just had a lot of leaves to clean up when we got back. \n\nBut due to road closures in SC the journey took longer than expected and we ended up having to stay a night in a hotel. There was absolutely no way we were making it home. So I hop on a hotel finding website on my phone, find a place with a room, reserve (not book! I never book online if I've never stayed there before), and head there. \n\nBuilding is black. Powers out. There's three or four other families out side who reserved rooms on Expedia (it's literally the only hotel listed as having vacancies). They say they've seen employees with flashlights walking around, but all the doors are locked and they get ignored. We call the front desk number. You can hear the phone ring but no one picks up. \n\nWe decide to drive to the other side of town and hop into another hotel to see if they have any vacancies. After playing the \"I worked for this chain\" and \"I have an infant\" cards one of the employees agrees to double up with a friend and let my family have their emergency room. So all is well. \n\nOr so we thought. We still get charged for the first room. My husband calls the hotel website as they are the charging party. He explains the situation, the girl is really nice, deals with the hotel. She says they have to call next day for the manager to see about getting a refund, but they'll handle that. Awesome!\n\nNot so much. The hotel has denied a refund. I don't know how that works. We physically couldn't get into the hotel. So we're going the route of a chargeback through the bank. I hate to do it since I know it can have negative repercussions on a business but this is stupid. Ugh. ",

I already had done my research and had an idea of the make and model of car I wanted and how much I wanted my monthly payment to be. The salesman showed me what they had, and there was only one car they had that was both what I wanted and possibly in my price range.\n\nWe sat back down in his office and he ran the numbers. \"I can do this car at $325 per month,\" he said. I had already told him that the maximum I could pay per month was $300. \"It's just not possible,\" he repeated, \"not with that car.\" We went back and forth a few times, but he was insistent on not being able to get that car for the price I wanted. Well, that's fine. If this dealership doesn't have what I want, maybe another one will. So I told the salesman I was going to take a look around at the other dealerships and began to bid him farewell. (He was so desperate for the sale, he was talking over me; it was very awkward.)\n\nAt this point, the manager walks in, introduces himself to me and my wife, and says he'll see what he can do. They go back into his office and, after a few minutes, come back with a monthly payment of about $297. Sounds good! I shook his hand again and accepted the deal.\n\nIn the financing office, another guy tried to sell me the extended warranties and Lo-Jack and stuff, and I declined all of it. But he was really pushing the low-end extended warranty, which would put me at $312 per month. I declined, partially because I know that extended warranties are almost always not worth it, but mostly because it would put me over my maximum. He went out of the room for a few minutes, and came back and said he could do it for $306. I again declined. He left the room again, this time for a little bit longer, and came back with a final offer: $299.99.\n\nI laughed; their tenacity was impressive, seemingly to the point of absurdity. I accepted, and asked him to just make it an even $300.00 for simplicity's sake.",

These men were huge biker dudes with beards that would draw envy from ZZ Top. \n\nThe packaging on the meat was shoddy so sometimes the barcodes would get wet with meat juices and the system would throw a hissy fit and refuse to scan.

When night falls, he transforms into ... well actually he's still a very ordinary IT consultant.*\n\n*Background:* As a self-appointed ICT professional, sometimes I am an expert, sometimes I have a minor clue what's going on, and sometimes Bing is my only friend; but in this tale of woe I am the end user. As I know that what I do for my (customer-facing) job is \"outside the ordinary\", I have my employer's computer environment running in a virtual machine (special software) - that way corporate can do whatever it needs to to the virtual computer and I can still do my job on other virtual computers without having a corporate change break my world. (As an example, the latest major change is that no-one has admin rights - which is fine until I need to load software to see network traffic on a customer site - aka \"work\").\n\nSo anyway, given it's \"not my computer\" and I'm \"just a user\", I now try to act like an ordinary user. Call the Helpdesk, \"It's broken, fix\" rather than fixing it directly. I reboot rather than just restarting a broken service. I reboot, rather than fixing a registry entry. I reboot ... well, I just have to reboot a lot.\n\nCorporate deploys software using Microsoft Configuration Manager (ConfigMgr). Usually they're pretty good, but this one program has been reinstalling time and time again because the post installation check is failing (the error code and messages are very specific). I've tracked down the errors in the appropriate log, and provided screenshots to the helpdesk along with the logfile extract, qualifying information, references etc. This is the resultant call, which has now been repeated (same issue, more info, new call, new Helpdesk staffer, same outcome nearly verbatim).\n\n&gt; **HD:** Thanks for calling the corporate Helpdesk, I'm HelpDesker, what's your userid?\n\n&gt; **Me:** Hi, userid is VTi-R.\n\n&gt; **HD:** Your user id is VTi-R?\n\n&gt;  **Me:** Yes.\n\n&gt; **HD:** I have your user id as VTi-R. How can I help?\n\n&gt; **Me:** I'm calling about an existing case, ID 121234345.\n\n&gt; **HD:** Your case ID is 121234345?\n\n&gt;  **Me:** Yes.\n\n&gt; **HD:** I have your case ID as 121234345.\n\n*I already feel this is not going to be a good experience. Hopefully that's just my bigoted mind.*\n\n&gt; **HD:** Let me review the case ... I see that the application is not installing.\n\n&gt; **Me:** No, that's not correct and not what I reported. The application is installed, operating correctly, but ConfigMgr is continually attempting to reinstall because the installation check fails. Do you have the screenshots and log file?\n\n&gt; **HD:** Yes I do, but the log file is wrong. I will connect to your computer, what is its IP address?\n\n*(Much faffing about because VPNs, bacon etc)*\n\n&gt; **HD:** This error is because it is past the deadline so we must install it.\n\n&gt; **Me:** Erm ... **it's already installed**.\n\n&gt; **HD:** Yes but we have to install it because it's past the deadline. May I do that?\n\n&gt; **Me:** Wha.. Bu.. Yeah OK, sure. Go for it.\n\n*HD clicks Retry button. Twelve seconds later, \"Installation failed\".*\n\n&gt; **HD:** Oh I see it failed, so the application isn't working?\n\n&gt; **Me:** The application is fine, see? Here's the data. Here's the program working. **Do you have the screenshots and log file**?\n\n&gt; **HD:** Can you show me the log?\n\n*I pull the log file, again, despite it being lodged with the call notes. I walk HD through the file, step by step.*\n\n&gt; **Me:** See, here's the entry where it detects the software is needed. Here it is kicking off the install. Here's the success code. Here's the failed detection afterwards.\n\n&gt; **HD:** The log file is incorrect, I will help you fix this\n\n*HD loads control panel tool, **CLICK ALL THE BUTTONS**. Inconceivably, does not fix the problem.*\n\n&gt; **HD:** I see it is not installing still, so the application isn't working?\n\n&gt; **Me:** The application is working properly, I showed you before. I will show you again. *Does so*\n\n&gt; **HD:** It is failing to install because it's already installed and our system needs to install it. I will configure the backend to *unintelligible*. It will take about 4 hours.\n\n&gt; **Me:** It's installing fine but something else is failing. You have not solved the problem. What exactly are you doing? Tech thing A or tech thing B? Or something else?\n\n*I can help you fix this if you'll actually read and listen!*\n\n&gt; **HD:** I am configuring the backend to *unintelligible* and it will attempt to install again in 4 hours. **End of phone call patter because 4h delay**\n\n5 minutes pass. HD closes ticket because resolved with comment \"Removed application from server\". /u/VTi-R still has continual reminders to install the installed software that the system can't tell is installed but has been removed. Never have I wanted more than to say \"Look could I speak to someone who can **ACTUALLY READ AN ERROR MESSAGE**\".\n\nAnd then they wonder why I run the SOE inside a virtual machine...\n\nTLDR: User has problem, provides screenshots, logs and reference information. Helpdesk ignores info, claims computer is wrong, logs and errors are wrong, ignores user and doesn't fix it, then claims it's fixed and closes the ticket so it's not their problem.",

As I am paying off a car loan, that would include sending some information from the lien holder (we'll just call them Bank to keep it anonymous) and they would then attach what OR needed and forward it to them. I was specifically told to include a check for my registration in what I forwarded to Bank.\n\n\nI may have stalled a bit in starting this process because I'm in school and I'm broke, but I finally got the money together (after asking Bank to delay my payment for a month) and asked Bank for the address to send it. I get all my paperwork together (including certification from the DEQ that my car isn't going to kill the environment any more than is acceptable) and even make sure to include the envelope for them to put everything in once done and pay for that postage as well.\n\nAbout a week and a half later, I see the check is cashed and feel relief, OR must have gotten my paperwork. But of course, I'm the anxious sort, and on Friday a bit of dread washes over me, what if the check was cashed by Bank instead of OR? I check my account and it just shows the picture of the check, being ultra paranoid, I check my car account and lo and behold, Bank cashed my check! The one that was \"Pay to the Order of: Oregon DMV\" and \"For: Registration\" on it!!\n\nSo I call, livid, and ask what happened. Bank's rep says they need to talk to the title department and find out, but they're of course closed by 3:30PST on a friday and not open on the weekend (I get banking hours are a bit conservative, but come on). So I call again about an hour ago. \n\nGreat news! I'm utterly boned. A) The address that I was given was they payment address, not the 'send us paperwork' address B) THey'll put in a refund request, but it could be denied because my payment is nearly due (the fact that it wasn't even their money is irrelevant) and C) All the paperwork (including the paid envelope) is likely destroyed. Oh, and a little icing on the cake D) they probably could have figured this all out on Friday if they bothered to look.\n\nAll I'm left with is they'll 'investigate' and let me know on Thursday if they can find the paperwork (which I find highly unlikely) and refund my money (which even if they do, doesn't help the fact that I still need to restart this entire process). Oh yeah, and the fact that I'll need to pay for another trip permit so my family (who's borrowing the car while I'm in school) doesn't get pulled over for expired tags. If I can't get this all sorted out soon, I may have to sell the car, when I'm only a year from paying it off. I guess I'll find out on Thursday...\n\ntl;dr: Needed to change car title and registration, Bank that holds loan gave me address to send paperwork to fill out then they'll forward, instead took my money, lost the paperwork and may not give it back.

        "text": "The guy isn't part of the store, but I just thought it'd be an odd little story to include.\n\nThe rat, thought...here we go!\n\nSo I'm at the big blue pretty store with my mom, and these two kids are giggling at a pallet of paint. I wave happily at them 'cause, aw kids. One pipes up, \"There's a rat!\"\n\nWe laugh. Because, rat? Naaah. \n\nYeeaaah.\n\nHe pointed so of course, I in all my adultness, kneels on the ground and sees...this gigantic rat. Like holy crud. My mom pauses when I tell her yes, it is real and big and huge. The kids rush off with giggles. She decides we have to tell someone because it might bite someone!\n\nShe finds no one. I'm sitting here, looking down at this thing as it wiggles and chews on something. Finally I say I'll go look.\n\nShe heads off to the garden center and I find two employees with two customers. \"There's a rat!\"\n\n\"WHAT\"\n\nSo I lead them all to the rat. One says, \"He's as big as a potato!\"\n\nThe manager has a ball peen hammer, gets on the ground.\n\n\"What are you doing?!\"\n\n\"I'm gonna squish him!\"\n\n\"No dude, you're on the wrong end, scooch.\"\n\nSo he moves and all I hear is \"Well that's not going to work\" and he gets up laughing.\n\nOf course, seriously, he does inform me they'll call someone to remove the rat before it becomes an issues but still, that was funny! \n\nBonus story: I'm sitting in their attached restaurant when this man stops in front. \"Oh, don't look sad, my queen!\"\n\nI have a resting sad face I guess??? I'm also very sick with allergies. So I just laugh, shrug. \n\nHe says something about 69% then \"and that 31% belongs to you~\"\n\n\"Oh, haha, that uh....nice?\"\n\nHe then proceeds to give me his number. I say oh yeah I'll...certainly give you a call.\n\n\"Goodbye, my love~\"\n\nI stare in almost shock as he leaves. No he was not an employee, I just...I guess I'm still in shock?? Later, before the rat incident, I heard his voice and yanked my mom out of the way. \"Nope nope nope!\"",

So I hopped in my car and drove down to this lovely little drugstore that has an amazing chocolate selection.\n\nI picked up a couple bars of the type he likes, and I go to check out. As the cashier is scanning my items, she notes that I have a rewards card, and tells me that with it chocolate is 3 for $6. She offers to hold my things while I grab a few more bars, so I accept and run off to get more.\n\nAs I head back, I hear yelling coming from her register, and hope I didn't get her in trouble by making another customer wait. But when I get up there, I see this lady angrily waving a bottle of mouthwash, and cursing at the poor cashier.\n\nAL: WHERE IS MY FREE BEER?\n\nC: I don't understand. Do you have a coupon?\n\nAL: NO, I BOUGHT THIS, AND I WANT MY FREE BEER. NOW.\n\nC: Ma'am, we're not running any specials with beer and mouthwash.\n\nAL: LOOK HERE YOU CUNT, IT SAYS I GET FREE BOOZE WHEN I BUY THIS FLUORIDE. \n\nI look at the bottle of mouthwash, and it hits me. It says 'Alcohol free with fluoride', meaning the mouthwash has no alcohol, but instead has fluoride to protect your teeth. The cashier has noticed too, and she tries to explain.\n\nC: Ma'am, that just means there is no alcohol in that mouthwash. \n\nAL: IT. SAYS. FREE. F. R. E. E. FREE ALCOHOL. NOW GET ME MY GODDAMN BEER OR I WILL GET YOUR GODDAMN MANAGER.\n\nWell, the cashier calls the manager, and explains, and I do my best to back her up. The manager then tries to explain to the lady that the label merely means there is no alcohol in this brand of mouthwash. \n\nM: Ma'am, it's like saying sugar free candy, meaning candy without sugar. It's not an offer.\n\nAL: YOU PEOPLE ARE IDIOTS. \n\nAL unscrews the mouthwash bottle and dumps it over the register before storming out. M, C, and I stand there in shock. \n\nX: Oh, my........ Wow.\n\nC: I'm so sorry you had to see that. I'll ring you up now.\n\nI didn't know if this belonged on Tales from Retail, or here, because I wasn't an employee. But if I'm wrong, I apologize. ",

Also, as we say, long time lurker, first time poster.\n\n\n\nSo I was in a cheap clothes store, a T-shirt in hand, and searching for a changing room.\n\nThe store had two changing rooms, closed with white curtains. One was currently used, and the other one was opened, with a lot of clothes curled up on the ground and the footstool. I though the lady using it must have left the room to try and find something else (there were no employees around) and waited for a bit. After about 5 minutes, I just though \"whatever, I only have one shirt, she can wait\" and go inside. No big deal.\n\nOnce inside, I notice something on the curtains... Lipstick. Not just a little stain, something someone who leave by opening the lipstick too close to the curtains... A red and big lips-shaped stained, the kind of stain you see on a tissue after putting make-up on. A lady, maybe the same that left her clothes on the floor, had used the curtains to wipe her mouth!\n\nShorly after I left the changing room, an employee came by and asked around, looking kind of distressed : \"does anyone own those clothes?\"\n\nNo response, she proceeded to pick up everything.\n\n\n\nLooking back at it, I think maybe I should have helped her...\n\nIt's probably not much, but it kind of baffles me to imagine someone can just leave the clothes they don't want, not even give them back to someone, and that someone would use a piece of curtain as their personnal tissue...",

        "text": "I think this story still applies to this sub reddit? Its my place of work and I was on the clock when it happened but I was buying food as I don't get a break so I eat on the clock. \n\nThis happened yesterday at the movie theater I work at. I'm a projectionist and had a few spare minutes so I went downstairs to the concession stand to grab some food. \n\nI approach the two people in the concession stand and chat with them for a bit. my ID and card are out so they knew I was looking to buy something. I waited for one of them to be ready and they just kept chatting and doing their thing. I wasn't in a rush so I just joined a bit though I was super hungry. \n\nCue a customer walk up. He walked out of his movie to get a refill on his popcorn. At this point my coworkers boyfriend who worked in the kitchen had come out. They were chatting and flirting with both their backs turned to us after basically choosing to ignore me instead of help me. I waited for a couple seconds totally appalled that they were blatantly ignoring this poor old man who just wanted a refill. When they made no quick notion to help him, I stepped in. I don't think I hid my annoyance very well. She turned around and gave all these fake \"Oh I'm sorry I didn't see you.\" shit. The man thanked me and I apologized for the wait. \n\n\nI did eventually get my order taken. But she didn't ring it up right. I wanted boneless wings with teriyaki on the side as the kitchen has a habit of drowning the wings in so much sauce that it looks like a bowl of teriyaki soup with a few bits of chicken. But she couldn't do it apparently. She's been working there for over 2 years and she doesn't know how to get plain wings with sauce on the side? Its literally one button. \n\nmaybe I'm biased because I just transferred to this location a few months ago from the corporate location where there was always someone from corporate keeping an eye on you. Or maybe people here just suck. \n\nI do have some lovely coworkers, but not nearly as many as I did at my old location. \n\n",

        "text": "It was my second date with this dude well out of my league, and already going it was going super because I was late, sick, and wearing new army boots which I'd forgotten you have to break in. I also carry everything in my back pocket- part of the reason I had been late was fishing my cards and phone out of a public toilet for ten minutes..... But that has no bearing on the service, this is just me being a total knob. \n\nSo I'm trying not to snot on him, ignoring the blood pooling at my heels and generally being charming. We sat down and I immediately remembered how the service here works, and why I don't come here very often. It's GREAT service don't get me wrong, but this is a little 'New York style' bistro where they sit down at your table rolling smokes while taking your order. That's chill, and has it's own charm, but we're awkward New Zealanders who can't interact with each other let alone a random dude who's telling us about his kids while we're sort of- just hoping to order some food, one day, please and thank you. \n\nWe order, we eat, I'm joneseing for some whiskey to numb the sickness and we ask our waiter if/what they have. He's obviously new, because he stands beside our table, and has the formal attitude that I'm used to, and apologies profusely that while he knows there IS whiskey, he's more versed in wine and he'll send someone over to talk to us. \n\nAbout 10 minutes later the manager, 'Big Red' because he was a burly bearded ginger lumberjack, sits down and puts two glasses of brown liquid with soda and ice in them in front of us. He mumbles an incoherent speech about how he really likes this whiskey, and my date probably will too, it's a nice entry level American blend..... and vanishes. \n\nSoooo- I had ordered the whiskey, not my date, who is a big ol' sweetheart that likes moscato and very fruity sake, and the speech was directed entirely at him while he frooze like a deer in the headlights and nodded anxiously. Also, there was no way Big Red knew this, but I'm the queen of whiskey. I'm one of the biggest wankers you'll meet about it. I really don't want to try an entry level American blend- in fact I'm such a snob, capped with being raised in Aberdeenshire- that I usually avoid American whiskey all together. However, trying new things is always grand and tbh it's probably GOOD for me to be forced to try something way out of my usual. Even if I had liked the damn thing though, I had no idea what it was, where it came from, how it was best served- because Big Red stepped away before I could ask. \n\nI usually drink whiskey neat, the only time I don't is if I'm tasting, and seeing how different ways of serving create different timbres, or if the bartender has specifically recommended a certain thing with ice, or water, or whatever. Usually they tell me why the recommend trying it that way. I've never had soda and ice shoved in a drink because... because I look like the type of person who might like that? (I do, unfortunately.)\n\nWe drank, it was fine, whatever it was. I work/ed in hospo for approximately a billion years so I saw they were absolutely slammed and decided just to drink it so it didn't go to waste  (well, more so we didn't have to repeat the same thing or look like total jerks...). We wnt up to pay our bill, and I tipped before looking because I'm an idiot, and also the people there ARE nice, and the nervous new kid deserved it.\n\nMother fucking thing cost more than our meals. And not because of the the whiskey, because of the goddamn SODA that he'd put in it. \n\nI was't even mad. It was the cheekiest thing I've ever seen a manger get away with. I do tell people all the time though, it's a very well known place and I thought it was fucking hilarious in retrospect... we'll go there again but I think we'll go next door for the drinks...",

Real pretty place. \n\nThe town is super small. Like 100 people, but it has a lot of stores, the most important of which (arguably) is the local grocer. It you don't want to go there then have fun driving an hour down country to the next closest one. \n\nThe place is hard to get around in, aisles are narrow and it's usually packed with tourists and locals. They have two cashiers. A young one and an old one. Both women. \n\nThe old one's lane was open and free as we came up. We have a handful of things. We say 'hi', it goes ignored. \n\nShe asks if we need bags. \"thanks, we'll be good as is.\"\n\nShe hrmphs. \n\nIt's thanks-giving weekend in our neck of the woods. So we ask if they're open on sunday and monday. \n\n\"9-7, same as every day,\" her tone is as close to rude as you can get before you're being full on condescending. We're wondering what we could have done to put her in such a mood. \n\nI'd heard her joking around with a shelf-stocker a minute beforehand when we we're shopping. So the attitude developed right around the time we came into her life. \n\nWe asked a couple other questions and she answered as curtly as humanly possible. We can only assume it was because we were from out of town.\n\nSucks to be her and anyone who has to deal with her though because serving tourists are likely the biggest part of her job. Debating on filing a complaint with the head office of her store, it's a chain, but doubt much would come of it. She wasn't full on mean, but she was by far the worst part of our trip and does a big disservice to her whole community being like that.  ",

However, long story short, it would seem that I had bought it for the wrong platform. Silly me. \n\nNow, someone recently told me that stores are required to give you back your money for anything digital within two weeks of purchase. This person was very sure of himself and I just wen along with his confidence and believed it. So I go back to the store, wanting to replace the game with the correct version, which is also totally allowed. Turns out, they didn't have the game for the correct platform anymore. They offer me store credit, but I want the money to go buy what I need somewhere else. So I confidently tell them that they are required by law to reimburse me. They tell me they don't. This went back and forth several times and I admit I was getting louder and very obnoxious. Eventually, I gave up.\n\nI went back home and had the sense to finally look up the rules. Turns out this law only applies to electronics you buy online. Oh the horror!\n\nThe next day, I went out and bought 500 grams of chocolates - Pralines we call them in Dutch, not sure what it is in English - of a nice, yummy brand and bought them  over to that same store. Unfortunately, the people that were there the day before weren't there at that time, but I handed the girl present the box of chocolates, explained the situation and apologized profusely. She told me over and over again that it wasn't necessary but I feel like it certainly was.\n\nI hope she filled in her colleagues and shared the chocolates :) and selfish as it may sound, I felt somewhat less guilty. I still shop there regularly and am now always polite and nice. I hope they forgave me. \n\nSorry retail workers! I sometimes think about it again and just cringe inwardly.",

I've worked retail since I was 16 and four years later I, sadly, still am but I am starting the application process for graduate schools for my dream job  :)  Not that it matters to the story but anyways here we go:\n\nAbout a hear ago I took my grandmother shopping to a big well known wholesale store that gives out samples specifically on weekends. Me never missing out on the chance smile and make sure I glance at each station to see if it is worth trying. One of stations had a sample of brisket. \n\nNow let's stop because we need to know some background info. I'm middle eastern but was raised in the US since I was an itty bitty one. Nevertheless the only \"American food\" I had was at school otherwise it was mostly rice, lamb (shitload of lamb TBH), chicken and some variation of soup at home. Very traditional middle eastern food. Not much beef although I knew what the hell it was I just didn't eat much of beef other than say hamburgers or taco meat.  Other than that I am not well versed in the different cuts of beef and I know this sounds ridiculous but it is what it is :( \n\nAnyways I approach the station and ask \"I'm sorry is this pork?\" The reason as to why is because I don't eat pork, more for cultural than religious reasons, and I didn't want to take the risk of eating something that was. Just a simple question, right? Well the middle aged worker looks up at me as if I had asked her the most ridiculous question on earth. She just stares at me as she responds back \"It's brisket.\" Duh. I force a smile and ask \"I know. Can you please tell me if this pork or not?\" She scuffs and rolls her eyes, \"Its brisket!\" She then turns to another customer who had been hanging around there and she rolled her eyes, telling the other customer \"Who doesn't know what brisket is?\" And they laugh. \n\nI was mortified. My face reddens and I just quickly turn around searching for my grandmother and try not to cry. I want to say I'm not overly sensitive even though this seems like it. I just never had a worker make fun of me before especially to another customer. It was awful especially since knowing that I would never dream to do this to one of my own customers and in the type of retail store I am now we are accustomed to getting ridiculous questions on a daily basis but it's our job to answer them in the most polite way possible.

I did not think a server could do anything that would prevent me from tipping, today that changed. \n\nMy husband and I decided to go to a chain diner for breakfast. It's busy, but much less busy then usual. We go here every other week and I usually request to be served by Sarah, our favourite waitress but her section today was the counter and we wanted a booth. Our server ended up being was a young woman in her late teens early 20s who was obviously new. \n\nMy husband orders some meat sandwich and hashbrowns with chili on them. I order a waffle with hashbrowns and start to explain that I am a vegetarian, but our server turns around and walks away while I am mid sentence. I will send back my food if there is any meat in it, so I always try to tell my server this to prevent any issues. \n\nShe comes out with my husband's food, and my hashbrowns. No chili on my husband's hashbrowns, and  I notice a few pieces of meat in my food. It takes a while for me to get her attention but when I did, I nicely explained that I am a vegetarian and there is meat in my food and my husband's doesn't have his chili. She asks me \"can't I just pick the meat out, or do you have to have a completely new one?\" I start to explain that eating any meat will make me have massive stomach problems, but she grabs both plates and walks away with me still trying to explain why I am being such a pain about it.\n\nShe comes back with my husband's right away, and brings out my new hashbrowns and waffle a while later, and at this point my husband is done eating. I don't really care, we are chatting and don't have anywhere to be. Right away I notice that one side of the hashbrowns are really dark and the other side is raw and uncooked. Our server does not come back to check on us so I just finish my waffle and wait until she comes back quite a while later. \n\nMy husband shows her the hashbrowns and tells her they are not cooked on one side. She has never apologized for any of the issues and starts looking really angry like she doesn't believe us and we are really bothering her. We weren't raising our voices or being aggressive at all, but I had only one fork which was on the waffle plate so my husband used his finger to flip over the cooked side to show her the raw side. \n\n... And she absolutely lost it. In a very angry loud  voice she yelled at my husband \"I don't have to take this from you. You can't treat me this way. I did not make this food and it's not my fault\". We went from talking to her in a normal voice to her in full on attack mode. My husband looked shocked and was starting to apologize but I stop him and in a very quiet voice I asked if she could please get us a manager. I saw her walk over to the manager and talked to her for around five minutes her body language oozing rage.\n\nThe manager came over and I could see she thought we had been awful to her poor server. We told her what happened, and that we were regulars, and named our normal server by name. I told her that in the past 6 months there has been meat in my food at least 5 times and it's always been fixed right away and never a big deal.  She goes to talk to our normal waitress and our server brings over our check still fuming. She doesn't even look at us. She took the hashbrowns off the check but doesn't say a word.\n\nI went up to pay and our normal server came over to say hello and see how we were doing. She is always really sweet, likely because I tip her really well. Last time I tipped 10 on a 20 dollar bill. I still have mixed feelings about it but I  just wrote terrible service on the tip line. \n\nAt the same time the manger came back to the table and told my husband he talked to Sarah and she said you were really sweet, and her favorite customers and she is sorry about what happened. \n\nMy thing is this, for great service i tip really well (30-50 percent) and for normal service or even poor service i generally tip 15 to 30 percent but not only was she a really bad server she yelled at us, and never once apologized or tried to make it right.  People aren't perfect, yelling at a customer for sending food back? I don't even...",

We went to the local pet store, and we bought the cutest, tiniest little hamster there. Little did I know that it had wet tail. Being young, I didn't know anything was wrong with it.\n\nI took it home, pet it a while, and at night, it cried. It cried so loudly my brother screamed to shut it up. I checked on it, and I guess moved it (can't remember). In the morning, it was dead. \n\nI begged my mom to get me another one. We went to the same pet store, and I got a teddy hamster. This guy was vicious. He bit me when I tried to hold him. I spent a time with him, but after a couple weeks I was sick of getting bitten. I returned him.\n\nNow, maybe there were a few hamsters in between. I can't recall; I can only remember the two stories I recounted. So, after some time, mum decided to take to me the local pet store, *again*. \n\nNow, there was an employee who had helped us previously. His name was Tom, and he had a missing ring finger. He was kind to me, and was the hero to this story. \nThere was a college-aged girl there, who was tall and thin, with brown hair. When we encountered her, I think Tom introduced us, she remarked, \"Oh, is this the girl who murdered all of her hamsters?\" \nTom glared at her, while I bowed my head, feeling ashamed. Tom set her straight; the hamster I first had was sick, and I had returned the hamster that bit me. \n\nI think we left the store after that, I can't remember; Mum, once in the car, called customer service to complain about the girl. From what I understand, she was fuming.\n\n\nTL;DR: Nine year old me branded a murderer because of sick and angry hamsters",

        "text": "A few years ago, when I was a poor student I ended up at a large supermarket. Purchased my groceries which came to a very satisfying £14. I had a 20 and a lot of change, so counted out £4 in change and handed it over with the £20. The cashier takes my money, puts it in the till and closes the drawer.\n\nI've worked retail, I know people make mistakes so I stay calm, ask for my tenner and the cashier freezes. I say that's fine, there's a queue, someone must have seen me right? In typical British fashion, I'm met with averted eyes and shaking heads. I say no worries, call the manager they can take a count. Manager arrives, closes out, takes the cash and takes me to customer service.\n\nI'm sat for ten minutes, then told this may take some time, leave my phone number and they'll call me once they've counted it. I'm ushered out the door. As I head to the bus I get a bad feeling leaving a chunk of my cash in this supermarket, and head back to wait.\n\nI talk to customer service lady, she's understanding and leaves me to wait. Half an hour later, about 45 minutes after the mistake, someone comes up to me and says they've counted the float, it's only £6 up, not £10, so there's nothing they can do.\n\nI say no way, you know tills are usually down, and certainly never in the positive. Anything above zero means the customer is giving you too much money, and in this case I gave you £10 too much. The woman refuses, we go back and forth, she tells me to go home. I say fine, who's your manager? She sighs, and gets on the radio.\n\nAnother woman turns up, hears my story, and arms crossed says \"no one would overpay like that.\" I'm like, well I did, check your CCTV, look at your till, you know how often they're down by a few quid? All the time. Especially in your huge multimillion pound company.\n\n\"Well it isn't ten pounds up, it's only six so there's nothing we can do\"\n\nI've lost my cool by now and started to cry, I can't afford to lose £10. I want to see the next manager. The woman says no, get out. I say no way, you've stolen money from me. I'm calling the police, I'm telling all my friends, I'm launching a twitter campaign... all that shit you think might work as a naive 20 year old.\n\nI'm making a real scene, my BF at the time wants to leave, I will literally starve if I don't get my money back. \"miss we're going to get security\"\n\nThen customer service lady hands a radio to my latest aggressor, who walks away for a moment, comes back having swallowed a lemon, says to customer service lady \"just give it to her\".\n\nI got out of there fast. I would live to say I never shopped there again, but of course I did, but from then on I never tried to be clever with change.\n\n**TLDR: tried to be clever with change, was assumed to be a scammer, spent an hour of my life and a large chunk of dignity getting my tenner back.**",

        "text": "A horrible experience from a local electronics repair shop. Let's start by saying the the number of overwhelmingly positive Yelp reviews and handful of negative reviews should have been a tip off of what to expect. This wasn't my first time needing such a service and I knew a little about how such a thing should normally be conducted. \n\nThis was back in May, by coincidence it was also my birthday. I needed my iPhone 5 screen repaired. The screen and the body of the phone started separating. This was causing light to bleed into one corner of the screen. You could visibly tell what was happening to the hardware. As for the light bleed that wasn't as clear cut. What I required was a brand new screen panel and LCD.\n\nI Googled for local shops that could repair my device. I was being cheap, refusing to drive far to visit a Apple Store. One local business happened to have over 400 positive reviews on Yelp and about 20 negative reviews. This should have been my warning. All the positive reviews were very similar, and as I later suspected fake. The negative reviews all had different experiences described, each detailing how horrible this business was at repairing cell phones.\n\nI went in and told the employee I saw my problem with the screen panel separating from the body. There solution was to glue the two pieces together. My first worry was when my smartwatch was still showing a active Bluetooth connection. Normally any hardware repair would require the device be shut off first for safety. Strike one: failure to shut of device before repair. The glue job took less then 10 minutes. No charge.\n\nI left the shop and immediately realized that this wasn't the solution to my problem. I returned explaining the the screen showed a light bleed. After some fumbling with the phone the employee said a new LCD was needed to fix the issue. I agreed to the repair which took about 30 minutes. I paid $80 for the repair and left. Again as soon as I exited the shop I started questioning the quality of the parts used. Strike two: fingerprints were smudged all over. The brightness of the screen didn't look like Retina quality. I had used iPhones with Retina screens for a long time and this looked bad. Strike three: knock off part/recycled? Suddenly I noticed the earpiece was missing the mesh covering. I could see wires poking out. Again I went back inside pointing the problem out to the employee. They looked at it and cut the wire with some pilers. The screen was now dead. \n\nAt this point I was getting very upset. The part that was given to me was of questionable quality and now broken. The employee then took a razor blade (yes a fucking razor blade you shave with) to open the screen panel. After a few minutes I was informed that they had no other black screen panels for my space grey phone. I was being offered a white panel as a alternative. Of course I didn't want that. I immediately noticed my original screen was still there sitting on the messy workspace with lots of broken parts.\n\nNow I was very upset. The entire table was a mess. I wasn't sure how this guy kept a clean workspace for repairing devices. So I asked for my original screen back and a refund. Luckily I went to a different repair shop that same day and was given a brand new screen for free. I didn't tell anyone it was my birthday. \n\nEDIT: If you are curious ask to what the negative Yelp reviews sounded like, one reviewer complained about a repair taking 4 hours when given a estimated time of 20 minutes.\n\n**UPDATE: Out of expediency I experienced another issue requiring my phone to be repaired. I had to return to the same business. Turns out the previously employee I encountered was at fault, not the business as a whole. A different person serviced my phone today with 100% satisfaction.",

        "text": "So a bit of a backstory, I'm 23 and have no idea how to cook for myself. I was never taught, and when I do try, I usually screw something up. You can read a recipe word-for-word, yet there are so many silly, basic things that you have no idea how to do within that recipe. I don't have a ton of time or money to spend screwing up breakfast, lunch, and dinner, so I usually stick with eggs, sandwiches, salads, smoothies, raw stuff, and prepared meals.\n\nAnother thing is that I have quite a bit of anxiety when it comes to shopping. I feel extremely nervous, like I'm being watched, and sometimes just have to leave the store, have my cart held at CS, chill out in my car, and come back. It's something I'm working on. But that's another thing that prevents me from cooking, is the fact that I have to look for ingredients I may not be familiar with and be confused.\n\nWell, I had my wisdom teeth removed and as soon as I could eat solid foods, I wanted a really good meal. I was craving pulled pork, had a slow-cooker I never used, and decided that's what I would do. I felt a little bit confident after being cooped up in the house for a bit.\n\nI found my ingredients okay, got a little confused with one and had an off-the-clock bank employee help me find it. Oops. That made me feel dumb. But she was really nice. :)\n\nI went for the pork last. I was completely confused. The recipe called for a boneless pork shoulder butt (is it a shoulder or a butt???) I could only find bone-in.\n\nI ended up picking up a tenderloin because it was boneless, and headed for the ice cream. Then I realized this was going to be a huge error and started to freak out a bit. The tenderloin I grabbed was the last one! There was a lot of stock missing in that area, so I wasn't sure where to put it.\n\nWhen I went to return the tenderloin and stare blankly at the different piggy parts again, there was a man with an apron emblazoned with a sausage brand logo stocking the shelves. I shyly and stupidly asked, \"hi, do you know about meat?\"\n\nHe turned out to be extremely nice and understanding. Turns out it's better if I don't go for the boneless roast, and I'll know if the meat's cooked properly if it's falling off of the bone. It'll pull right out. \n\nI felt like such an idiot, an adult woman unable to cook for herself, freaking out over a basic, everyday process. But it felt so good to have *someone* there to help. He wasn't even an employee of the store, and had nothing to do with non-sausage products, I assume.\n\nDespite making a couple mistakes and having to put the roast back in after I thought it was undercooked, my meal turned out to be absolutely fantastic. I couldn't have done it without this fabulous meat guy. :) \n\nI'm always a bit too shy to ask for help when I need it, so I tend to just avoid things I'm unfamiliar with. Well, that experience completely turned things around for me. Retail employees and various experts, you never know when you might REALLY change someone's life with the simplest thing. I know this story makes me sound really pathetic, but I don't care. It is what it is. What matters is this person's kindness and willingness to take some time to help a truly confused, nearly-panicking, hungry girl out. I know it sounds silly, but I was truly touched. Thanks, meat man. :)",

I also got the automated 'please fill out a survey concerning your experience' call and filled it out accordingly.\n\nSome backstory, I have _MAJORISP_ for internet because their competitors haven't made it here yet. I hate having them for various reasons, but they're actually 'better' than the others here. Not saying much, but I digress.\n\nNow onto the story. My modem started acting up to the point of not allowing certain sites through -- they'd just sit there but never fully load. Didn't matter the system, didn't matter the browser or being wired/wireless those sites would just not load. Even a factory reset to the basic configuration did nothing. My cellphone has a data plan, and even that wouldn't connect to them unless I was *off the wifi*. Essentially, anything going through the modem was SOL.\n\nSo I call their tech support line and after **finally** convincing the automated system that no, it couldn't help, I got a live rep. He's got a heavy accent but it's bearable... for the most part, as long as he doesn't speak too quickly. I tell him the issue and what I've done and that I think it's the modem having issues. He still has me go through various troubleshooting (most I'd already done but I know they have a script) when we get to the point where he's spending more and more time putting me on hold to look up possible solutions. I figure at this point he's going to either come to the same conclusion as me on his own or remember that I'd told him earlier I was 99% sure it was the modem.\n\nInstead, he gives me this gem:\n\n&gt;\"I'm sorry, ma'am, but I can access those sites just fine here. You're going to have to call them one by one and tell them you are having issues connecting to them.\"\n\nWait.. what?\n\nAs I'm trying to wrap my head around his thinking I suddenly realize that he's *already going into his call closing speech* and about to hang up on me! I admit, I raised my voice and told him under **no** circumstances was I going to do that and that I'd already told him about the modem/data plan conclusion. He was silent for a good five minutes before finally stating that he'd place an order for me for a new modem.\n\nCan't wait to see what refurbished garbage they've sent me.\n\ntl;dr: Tech support thinks I should call multiple corporations to inform them I can't access their sites because my modem is bad",

        "text": "Should I even write this? I dunno, might as well though. It's been a nightmare from the start, so this might take a while.\n\nHad a Latitude laptop - E6330, business style, sturdy and all. All nice and good until I started having issues with the microSD card slot - it just wouldn't recognize anything I put in there.\n\nGreat. So I contact customer support, and as it's still under warranty, they send a technician to me to fix it. He comes, replaces the motherboard, and... still an issue. He calls them, they tell me to send it in for them to fix. Except they want to replace the motherboard... again. Which they just did literally an hour ago, and which also seemed a bit excessive for a faulty SD card slot, that could just as well have been a driver issue. They still want me to send it in, so who am I to argue? I do it. I also note that the motherboard temperatures were way higher than they were supposed to be, and write that down for them to resolve as well.\n\nFast forward a week and and a half. I get the laptop back, together with a fancy paper that says \"All your issues have been tested for and resolved.\" Open up the laptop, and... still doesn't work. Motherboard temps are hitting the fan, and I can't understand for the life of me how they \"tested\" for these issues and didn't find them out in the open.\n\nI contact customer service again, and they tell me to go download one of Lenovo's SD card drivers. Lo and behold, it works - on a computer which its own manufacturer's drivers are broken. Still have the motherboard at 67C when idle (no background programs running), so they want me to send it in for a replacement laptop.\n\nGreat! I'm happy trying to imagine what I'll get soon, so I send it in and start corresponding via email.\n\n...But, one thing to ask him first. What will the new laptop be? Will it have the same specifications as the old one? I had a business laptop, that's reportedly sturdier than regular ones.\n\nHe tells me... \"I don't know. We'll both find out what the system is when it arrives at your door. It will have the same or better specifications though in every aspect.\"\n\nAnd then I ask him what will happen if the replacement laptop also has heating issues. He says:\n\n\"If the system exchange you receive has the same heating issue. You can address it to us and we will then have to escalate the concern to Deel internal. I doubt that will happen though.\"\n\nSo it comes, and it weighs over 5 pounds. My old laptop was ~4, and it's annoying to carry this around. I don't notice at the time that it doesn't have a webcam, and my old laptop did, so technically it's a wrong replacement as well.\n\nAnd I boot up the laptop, and what do I find? The CPU running at 70 C on idle for extended periods of time, and goes up to 90C (shown with screenshots in the email). I tell him this is ridiculous, and his team leader replies:\n\"70 C, while it seems hot, is outside of the guidelines for a new system exchange.\"\n\nI have no clue what to think. The whole reason I got my first replacement laptop is because of a 67C motherboard, and now he's telling me that it's not a good reason? This makes no sense.\n\nAnd this is with a new system, out of the box. The temperatures lasted through the next few days as well. I emailed him everything, and didn't hear a peep.\nAfter being dropped off by the Deel ProSupport team leader of all people, I yet again have to call customer service, and bring in a new guy into all of this. I call up again, and a new guy takes the case - telling me he's my point of contact.\n\nHe reads all the emails I forward him from previously, and shoots the message up the ladder to the REC team. The REC team is only supposed to deal with the most messed up cases, and I guess mine qualified at this point. I speak to the REC team representative, who now is my new point of contact, and he tells me the old laptop wasn't registered properly.\n\nNo problem, right? I mean, I have a new laptop now, don't I? Nope. Gotta register the old laptop before we deal with any of this. So I ask him, why in the world didn't the first four representatives I spoke to deal with this? He tells me \"they messed up\".\n\nI give him a week, and he solves the registration issue. He then takes a 2 week vacation - keep in mind that this is from a team that's supposed to deal with crisis management. Brilliant.\n\nThen I get an email from the first Deel representative, who arranged for me the system exchange. He says \"I spoke with my supervisor, and we can get you another system exchange.\"\n\nI tell him \"great!\" I think, now I finally can get rid of these crappy heating issues, and get a laptop that is normal for once.\n\n...But nobody's answering, because after being in for two days (during which I've tried everything to contact him, but he ignored all calls and emails), the REC team representative takes another week and a half vacation.\nI'm ready to just throw in the towel already, Deel's acting worse than most Chinese companies I've had to deal with. I email both the REC backup team (which I was supposed to contact when he was out) and his team leader, whose contact information was given to me by the REC representative himself.\n\nI hear nothing. I call customer service from square one again, and ask to be given another REC team's team leader's email address. I email him, and he tells me:\n\n\"Thank you for reaching out, and I apologize for the frustrating experience that you’ve had thus far. Mr. Team Leader is actually no longer with Deel, and I have taken over his role as team lead.\"\n\nFantastic. I'm given yet another Deel REC representative point of contact while my original guy's out of office. What does he tell me?\n\n\"I was looking over your case and would like to let you know that while Guy #1 has stated he would look into an exchange [flat out wrong, I was promised another exchange], that doesn’t look like it would be an option as he is not the case owner. I do apologize for any misinformation.\"\n\nWell, what the heck. The new system had volume skips as well that made me nearly deaf a number of times, and I add this to the list of issues this \"new\" system has. He mixes up the problems I've been having for a few days, and it takes another for me to correct him about the issues with the replacement system.\n\nHe then tells me (remember, this is guy #5, and guy #2 on the REC team that I've had to deal with) that \"70C for the system isn't out of the norm, as long as there's no thermal events in the bios.\"\n\nSo I correct him; \"it's 70C when idle, but above 90C with a medium load.\" He says it doesn't matter, it can be hotter than a volcano and it won't be considered an issue unless there's enough overheating to have the computer shut itself down.\n\nI send it in to him, and ask if I can be given my old laptop back in the meantime; they've been keeping the new laptop for 2 weeks already to test it, and I needed to work. Nope, no can do, they said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Vacation guy (representative #4, and REC team member #1) comes back, and takes over the case - another switch in point of contact. He has the new laptop, and starts testing it yet again.\n\nA week goes by and I hear nothing from him, and it's passed ridiculous at this stage. I email and call him asking to have some updates on which stage the testing is in.\n\nSo, while 40-50C is hitting the limit on a CPU temperature, and 90C is universally considered dangerous, they've just shrugged and said that the replacement was a mistake in the first place, and that they're not willing to give me a new exchange, despite being promised one from a Deel representative - who talked it over with his supervisor who also agreed on this.\nStill have the volume skips up until today, they couldn't reproduce it and therefore said it wasn't an issue.\n\n...5 months later, my laptop shuts down numerous times because of: CPU overheating.\n\nI can't do this anymore. There's no warranty on the new laptop for one, but it's ridiculous that a 5 month $1400 laptop would have thermal events for CPU overheating.\n\nI give up.",

        "text": "The local supermarket recently moved into their new, much-larger building. This means I have a new layout to learn and I see a lot of new faces. This is not a problem, as I don't mind wandering through the store while I listen to podcasts and try to find that one elusive item on my list. Okay.\n\nThis time, not so much. Try as I might, I can't find a particular blend of frozen vegetables that the spouse asked for. So, I gave up and asked a stocker who happened to be working the section, and he cheerfully went out of his way to hook me up. Awesome.\n\nFive minutes later, I'm in the next aisle over and growing desperate to find frozen ravioli. I don't want to bug that guy twice, but I've looked everywhere I can think of. Sheepishly, I wander back to where he was, apologize for interrupting him *again,* and he guides me to the exact shelf where the ravioli are.\n\nAt this point, I'm blown away. I've worked in retail for most of my adult life, and most of *that* was in supermarkets, and I've *never* seen a guy who was that helpful *and also that happy to help.* This man is a model-fucking-employee. So, drawing from that same experience, I decide that getting positive feedback from a customer would probably make that guy's day.\n\nOn my way out, I ask the cashier if there's a manager available who I can talk to about an employee, expecting them to either call someone over from the customer service desk or refer me to the \"comments\" box. Problem: It is quite late and the manager who would be at the customer service counter is long gone. My \"case\" gets escalated to the next manager up, who works in the back of the store. I first begin to worry when my cashier pages said manager for \"customer assistance.\"\n\nOh, well. There's nobody in line behind me and that stocker really deserves commendation for his work, so I can wait. After a minute, the manager trots out to meet me, we exchange greetings, and I quickly let him know that so-and-so who's working in the freezers is an outstanding employee who any store would be glad to have on their team, \"and he deserves a raise... or whatever award you give people here.\"\n\nNow, the manager's response, as well as I could make it out: \"*NOPE!* There's absolutely nothing [unintelligible but clearly annoyed mumbling]\"\n\nI'm taken aback by this, but he seems distracted, so maybe he's got something else to deal with: \"Ah. Well in that case, I'm sorry if I interrupted something important for this.\"\n\n\"No, [unintelligible but sarcastic mumbling] *just running an entire store* [more mumbling].\"\n\nI can't be too bothered by insults I can't hear, so I'm ready to get my receipt and move on with my life, but the cashiers who have been helping me must be used to deciphering Mr. Mumble because they're standing in stunned silence. Eventually, one of them pipes up, \"That is not an acceptable thing to say to a customer.\" The other just says, \"Wow.\"\n\nBefore I leave, one of them helps me fill out a form that she says will get the helpful stocker a small gift card and a positive note in his file. As far as I can tell, they all deserve one for working under that manager and not turning into a bunch of sarcastic jerks like him.",

        "text": "Let me preface: Since there really isn't anywhere to write patient stories for shitty doctors, I'm going to write it here. I guess being a patient is like being a customer especially in the United States. \n\nI've had a migraine for nearly a week now. I missed a day of work because I could barely lift my head off my pillow and I went to urgent care who said it wasn't anything immediate, so they told me to wait a couple days and see if it goes away; if it didn't I should call my primary care physician. I never really had a migraine that lasted more than 12-24 hours so this was unusual for me. \n\nLast night I was still feeling crappy and this morning I felt awful, so I called my primary care physician before work and they told me they had no appointments for urgent cases and they would have a nurse call me in a little while. \n\n(Sidebar about my job: I'm a paralegal in a non-profit law firm focusing on housing, bankruptcy, and consumer matters. City tax foreclosure season is in full swing and next week is the negotiations with the city attorneys. This week I had to make 38 phone calls to potential clients with urgent clients to complete an intake for attorney assignments.  The deadline for assignment was at 5 pm today. I've been dealing with the stress of that on top of whatever this migraine is and the stress probably made it worse). \n\nAnyway, luckily I had the nurse call me while I wasn't on the phone with a client. I answered and they asked me questions. They told me they have an appointment at 11 am. It was 9:30 am at the time of the call. I take the bus to work and I wouldn't have made it if I had to take the bus there not to mention missing work was out of the bus. I told the nurse that was impossible and she connected me to the receptionist who offered me an appointment at 1 pm after I told her I can only make it after 3 pm today. When she said there was nothing else today, I asked her about appointments tomorrow. I have training tomorrow and it's only until noon, so I could have easily had an afternoon appointment any time for 1 to closing time. They told me that they didn't and kept pushing me to come in at 1 pm. I kept insisting I cannot leave work and drop everything at a drop of a hat and they kept offering me a doctor's note. That wouldn't have helped the 15 calls I had to make today. I told her after that that I'll go to urgent care again or find help elsewhere. \n\nA few hours later I checked my phone. There was a voicemail from one of the nurses that they want to complete a follow up in regards to my call to urgent care visit. That pissed me off because 3 hours before I was on the phone with them for the issue I went to urgent care for and I told them that I was already there.  Through this ordeal, I was texting my mother and this also pissed her off. \n\nMy mom is a stereotypical Italian mama bear type of mother even though all her kids are grown. She meddles in a lot of stuff and God sometimes I appreciate it so much especially in this situation. \n\nA few years ago, I had a herniated disc in my lower back. I authorized her on my HIPPAA forms to be my emergency contact which means she has consent to pick up my prescriptions and to discuss my health matters with the staff. The primary reason for this was so if I was in immense pain, she'd be able to go pick up my scripts for me. Today it came in handy for the latter. \n\nShe got so infuriated that SHE took the liberty to call the nurses to tell them a thing or two. Nurse Ratchet picked up and gave my mom the most unprofessional attitude. She told my mom that she's going to talk first then my mother can. Nurse Ratchet tried to turn the situation around on me saying I didn't accept either of their appointments they offered me that I repeatedly told them no I cannot make because I have to work. Then she accused my mother of yelling at her. My mom can have the Italian - Irish temper but she was at work when she called and she was nothing but professional. (I know her work ethic because she instilled mine). \n\nMy mom started listing off the injustices that the office has committed the past few months (this is just the final straw). Then she told Nurse Ratchet that we're quitting the practice and one of the reasons is her attitude. Nurse Ratchet told her no she doesn't have an attitude and then she said again my mom was the one with one. My mom told her she didn't want to continue the conversation and that my gynecologist will help me with the matter and I'll be not coming back. \n\nThe office tried calling my mom again and she didn't answer. \n\n*TL;DR* -doctor's office pretty much told me they have no time to see me then offered me 2 appointments during work hours. My meddling mother who's on my HIPPAA form and authorized to speak called to tell a thing or two about their practice. Nurse was completely rude to her and my mom said we're quitting going there. \n\n\n\n",

        "text": "I work in pseudo-retail (signs and screenprinting, but it's not really retail if that makes sense).  I deal with the public daily.  I have always, from my first job in a secondhand clothing store until the day I die, treat customers the way I would expect to be treated if the roles were reversed.  I actually have 2 stories to help give retail workers faith in some customers (or at least me!).\n\nThis past weekend I was at the grocery store and I had seen a package of puff pastry sheets, but having never used them I disregarded them.  Two days ago I came across a delicious recipe using them, so yesterday I went to get a package.  The shelf was empty, they were on sale 2 for $5.  I ended up getting frozen sheets, which were almost $5 for one pack.  After paying I went to customer service and asked if they still did rainchecks.  I was told if it was in the flyer on sale, then yes, but not for in-store sales.  After looking through the flyer quickly (less than a minute) and not seeing them I thanked him for his help and left.  I didn't cause a scene or complain.  It wasn't in the flyer, there's nothing he can do.\n\nEvery week we have a tradition with my kids, we go to a certain fast food place, generally through the drive-thru so we can eat at home.  My toddler tends to make a mess and it's just easier and less embarrassing to clean up at home.  The girl that is almost always at the drive through is about the sweetest girl, if I don't order a slushie for my son she will hand me one on occasion for free (I've taken to ordering them just so she doesn't give a free one, don't want her getting in trouble!).  The guy that works inside at the counter has the BEST customer service skills, the guy is awesome!  They're part of the reason we go weekly.  Well, my husband, on the rare Fridays he doesn't go out, will go with us but prefers to eat inside.  The last two times our toddler has spilled food and/or a drink.  I always feel like crap walking up and asking for a broom or mop to clean it up.  Why?  Because my kid made the mess, why should they have to clean it during a busy time?  I'm perfectly capable!!  \n\nI don't know, I just think if more customers treated the workers how they'd expect to be treated, people would be a lot nicer.  Some people just seem to have this privileged attitude, like retail workers are beneath them.  \n\nSo keep doing what you're doing, ignore the few jerks out there and know that some of us aren't so bad :)",

I tried to tackle it on my own for a few days but none of the fixes or tests managed to get me a resolution. I wanted my PC before the holiday long weekend so I tried to ring around a few places to see if someone could look at my PC same day but I could only find one place.\n\nWhen I arrived to hand over my PC, it looked like a normal place. PCs pulled apart, some diagnostic tests being run on some and a handful or new parts on shelves. No red flags just yet.\n\n&gt; Me: Yeah, my blue screens don't seem to be happening at anything predictable.\n\n&gt; Him: Hmm, could be a few causes. Leave it with me and I'll give you a call in a few hours.\n\nA few hours later I get a phone call from him,\n\n&gt; Him: Yeah hi, it's XXX from mom and pops just letting you know your PC is ready to be picked up. I can't fix your issue but there are some things I need to show you that could be causing your problems.\n\nWhen I arrived he showed me a small dust pile that he's pulled from my fans and mentions overheating despite temperatures being under control. I ask what tests he's run and this is where it gets really good.\n\n&gt; Him: What tests did I run? Oh, I ran a disk defrag and a disk health checker and it didn't blue screen at all so there isn't much more I can do.\n\n&gt; Me: What about the blue screen dumps? The log files? Did you check those and see if there is anything in there that you recognize?\n\n&gt; Him: Blue screen dumps? Logs? What are you talking about.\nI open the blue screen dumps and showed him.\n\n&gt; Me: These are what I'm talking about.\n\n&gt; Him: What? Why are you storing those? You should delete those because your computer remembers them otherwise and will keep crashing.\n\nHe moves to delete them before I stop him.\n\n&gt; Me: Are you serious? Alright, I'm taking my gear and going. You have literally no clue.\n\n&gt; Him: Okay, that will be $80 for my time.\n\n&gt; Me: Err, not happening. I'm out of here.\n\nI pack my gear and leave. I didn't get it fixed by the weekend but I did find out what my issue was when it stopped running all together. Busted HDD and a replacement one of those got me back in action.",

        "text": "So I work retail and this is about the store I work at, but I was a customer in this situation.\n\nThe store I work at got rid of the self-checkouts, and put in express lanes instead. This is upsetting to me for many reasons: \n\n1. It's slow. Even in express lanes, there's other people in front of you, regardless of how few items they have. And you know there's always going to be that one asshole who disobeys the \"15 items or less\" rule just because they're entitled and impatient. This means I could spend my entire 15-minute break waiting in line.\n\n2. Feeling weird/judged about buying certain items. I'm a woman. I like buying my fucking tampons in private. I don't like someone ringing up my stuff. I have social anxiety and I do NOT want to interact with the cashier when I'm buying things like that, or worse, a pregnancy test. I'd hate to get judged for that kind of thing, it's just all-around upsetting.\n\n3. So as I got off work today I was buying myself a few snacks to eat when I got home, and I went through the express lane. I asked the woman who was behind the counter why our store got rid of the self-checkouts, because I asked a grocery manager how she felt about it earlier, and she said she's glad because it reduces theft (which does make sense, assholes stealing ruined it for everyone) , but the woman behind the counter said, \"oh no. The store just wants us to have more interaction with the customers.\" \n\nWhat. So the fucking store would rather take a step backwards in terms of technology, speed, and convenience, so the cashiers could \"interact with the customers\" more? As a customer, especially someone who just got done working and has probably had a bad day, or if I'm just stopping in on a day I'm not working to buy tampons or personal feminine items, the LAST thing I want to do is fucking interact with someone. Sometimes I'm too anxious and upset and can't.\n\nAnyone else think it's ridiculous that my store got rid of something that was easy, convenient, and made employees AND customers happy, to try and get people to \"interact with each other\" more? Maybe people don't want to interact and just want to get their shit done. I'm so fucking mad. ",

Not today.\n\nI scheduled the delivery for yesterday but due to changing plans had to call up to reschedule the delivery for later in the day.\n\nCall #1 - I asked if the delivery could be moved to later in the day.\n\"No, sorry ma'am we can't do that. But we can reschedule for tomorrow.\"\nOkay, fair enough. Could it be between 7pm and 10pm tomorrow?\n\"Yes, however the system isn't allowing me to edit the order at the moment, could you please call us back in 2 hours\"\nWell, that's inconvenient, but sure I guess so.\n\n2 hours pass.\n\nCall #2 - This time I got a Kiwi, let's call him James. Hi there, I'm hoping to reschedule my order for tomorrow between 7pm and 10pm.\n\"Not a problem ma'am! The system isn't allowing me to make any edits right now but I'll keep an eye on it for you and make the change when it opens for editing\"\nThanks James! I like James.\n\nGo about my day as normal. Find a voicemail message in the evening around the old delivery time.\n\nMessage - \"Hi this is Supermarket Online. The driver is waiting outside with your delivery but no one is at home. Please give us a call back\"\n\nHuh??? Jaaaaaames!\nWelp, too late to do anything about it now.\n\nThe next day.\nWake up to a text from Supermarket Online.\n\nText - \"Your order will arrive today between 7pm and 10pm\"\nOkay, good.\n\nGet home from work and check delivery ETA.\n\nDelivery ETA - \"Your order will arrive between 6:35pm and 7:05pm. We know this is outside of your selected delivery window, sorry for any inconvenience, please call us if you have a problem.\"\nWell, I'm home already so I guess it doesn't matter.\n\n7:10pm, no delivery... \nRefresh ETA.\nNo change.\nSigh.\n\nCall #3 - \"All of our customer care representatives are busy at the moment. Would you like a call back when someone is free? The estimated time is 35 - 44 minutes.\"\n😰 Fine....\n\nOnly 20 minutes later\n\nCall #4 - Answer phone. Pre-recorded message begins to play but cuts off as call hangs up on me.\n..... oookay\n\nCall #5 - Call back. Reach a person this time. Hi, my delivery was scheduled to arrive by 7:05pm, the delivery ETA has not updated since then. Is there a glitch?\n\"Oh, sorry I don't know what's going on there. I'll organise for you to get a text in 5 minutes with an updated delivery ETA.\"\nThank you. If I don't get a text how long should I wait before calling back?\n\"You can call us back in 30 minutes if you don't get a text. But be assured that the driver is on his way.\"\nOkay, thank you.\n\nNo text.\n30 minutes later.\n\nCall #6 - Wait on hold. 10 jingles later.\nHi there, this is my 6th call about this delivery. I was told to wait and receive a text for an updated delivery ETA, but no text came.\n\"That's strange, you never would have received any such text. How about I call the driver and get an ETA for you?\"\nYes please!\n\n2 hold songs later.\n\"The driver is having trouble finding your address, can I put you through?\"\nYes! Please do!\n\nHi driver. Yes, I live near the mechanics. Okay, I'll come outside. Come back towards the mechanics. I'm waving to you. Here near the roundabout. Oh good, you see me.\n\nI asked the driver how many times Supermarket Online had called him.\n\"Only once\"\nNot happy, call #5.\n\nAnd thus, I finally acquired my delivery.",

        "text": "So, another fast food post reminded me of this.  Went to a fast food chain burger place and ordered a hamburger with no pickles and a small coke (this place does burgers with mustard, ketchup, onions and pickles).\n\nI don't really know if the first burger was correct or not as there was no clean way to open the bun, they had put so much ketchup on the burger that when they wrapped it the ketchup had oozed out and was covering the inside of the wrapper and the outside of the bun.\n\nOh well, mistakes happen so I bring the ketchup soaked burger and wrapper up to the counter and kind of jokingly say to the manager that I had just wanted no pickles, not extra extra ketchup and asked if it could be remade.\n\nThe manager talks to the grill person and tosses the mess and I figure all is well.\n\nI open the second attempt and this one I did open even though the condiments were once again so plentiful that the bun was swimming in them.  No pickles, no onions, no ketchup, extra, extra mustard and extra extra mayonnaise (mayonnaise doesn't even come on their hamburgers).\n\nI have to admit that I am kind of pissed at this point.  Maybe I am wrong but I was pretty sure this was not a second breakdown in communication and instead deliberately fucking with me.  I did not yell or swear but it was probably clear that I was angry when I went back up and showed the manager the second burger and asked for a refund.\n\nAs the manager was getting my money he muttered under his breath, \"Why do I get all the angry customers?\"\n\nIt seemed like a rhetorical questions so I did not try to answer him but when I wrote a complaint to the company I made sure to include the managers question along with my answer that, while mistakes happen and we are all human, stopping your grill crew from deliberately screwing with customers might be a good way to cut down on angry customer complaints.",

        "text": "Context: I am Jewish. The Jewish New Year, Rosh Hashanah, ends tonight at sundown. For those unfamiliar with the holiday, Jews celebrate it by having a family dinner for one or both nights that it lasts. This year, those two nights were Sunday night and Monday night. \n\nSo. My family got through the first night and we ended up scarfing down all the desserts. Since Jews use apples and honey to represent bringing in the new year with sweetness (or something; it's been a while since I went to Hebrew school), apple cake is a Rosh Hashanah staple. We could not have a second dinner without more apple cake.\n\nCut to me going to the local specialty grocery store in my very Jewish area to pick up more cake. I figured that I only needed half a cake, but when I got to the bakery, I only saw full apple cakes. So, I asked the employee at the bakery if there were any half apple cakes left. The employee wasn't sure so she excused herself to ask the other baker. I could hear their conversation:\n\nNice Baker: \"Hey, do we have any half apple cakes?\"\n\nAngry Baker: \"WHAT. WHO STILL WANTS THAT. THAT HOLIDAY IS OVER. WHATEVER WE HAVE IS LITERALLY RIGHT THERE. TELL THEM TO LOOK.\"\n\nNice Baker: \"...thanks.\"\n\nShe came back to me and kindly explained that all they had left was out on the floor. I thanked her and then I said loudly, \"HAPPY SECOND NIGHT OF ROSH HASHANAH.\"\n\n**tl;dr** A baker working in a very Jewish part of town did not know that Rosh Hashanah lasts two days and was very irate about it.",

I installed the spare went to the car parts store for a little baby air compressor because (of course) the spare was low on air.  24 minutes after the posted closing time of the Tire store with good Discounts, I drove over to see what their hours would be tomorrow.\n\nThe bay doors were still open and the worker bees were busy on a couple of cars, but hey, closed is closed, no hard feelings.  Thinking about coming back at lunch tomorrow, I was walking back to my car and an employee pulled up a customer's car to the front for delivery after they got some dank new wheels or whatever.  The employee got out of the customer car and I said \"I guess I missed it, huh.\" and he said, \"Well, what do you need?\"\n\nFast forward and we're about 50 minutes after close of business, and I'm out the door with a fresh new tire for $0 thanks to the road hazard warranty, plus a $15 warranty renewal for the new tire.  While I was waiting in the lobby watching the mechanics through the ~~fishbowl~~ big window, one guy came in and called a customer to tell them their car was ready.  After moment of silence on the phone, the mechanic said\n\n&gt;Yes sir, but we stay until all the work is done.\n\nDo you want customers for life? Because this is how you get customers for life.",

        "text": "Honestly pretty simple scenario. I live in a fairly small southern town, and went into a smallish chain grocery store to pick up some miscellaneous food items. When I got to the checkout line I realized I didn't have my bank card, so I decided to simply write a check. I was in quite a hurry, and not really thinking straight, and barely registered it when the cashier told me their machine was malfunctioning in some way, and to leave the check blank. She said she'd have the manager ensure that everything went through correctly. Now, I know there are a million red flags with that statement, but like I said I was really rushed, and my mind was elsewhere, whatever. Fast forward to the parking lot and I looked at my receipt and discovered that the check had been ran for $110, and there was $60 in change. The cost of my items was $50.\n\nThe cashier claimed that she made a mistake pressing a button or something, but the check had been clearly filled out for $110. She was terminated on the spot right in front of me, and told to go to the manager's office to await his decision on whether or not he was going to press criminal charges against her. I haven't yet looked into the possibility of me doing the same.\n\nIn any case, I've learned a stupidly elementary lesson today. Don't just idly accept things your cashier tells you. Robbery may happen from the other side of the counter...",

They are terrible at all other things. The revolving door of employees are slow, rude, careless, and stupid.\n\nThey *constantly* get my order wrong, and when asked to fix it they're rarely apologetic and usually annoyed with me. Yes, how dare I not order what I want, not what you gave me!\n\nToday really took the cake though. I stopped there to get me and my GF some breakfast. Things were slow, which is typical. They took my order and repeated it back to me correctly. I got up to the window to pay and found two employees standing there, window wide open, complaining about something. Loudly, and with very colorful word choices. I don't really care, but it's really unprofessional.\n\nThen I get up to the window to get my food and I'm handed two sodas. Now, I hate ice in my soda and always order it with no ice. Both of the sodas had ice in them. I tell this to the girl in the window, and request to be given the correct soda. This is her response:\n\n&gt;Because they didn't put it in the computer as no ice, I'd have to go out to the lobby to get it.\n\nI wasn't in the mood to start an argument or get my soda spit in, otherwise I would have told her to do that, considering it's her fucking job. I asked her if she could use the automatic soda machine to make one, she said she couldn't. I'm guessing that's bullshit and she just didn't know how, because you could when I used to work fast food.\n\nI've never had an employee state so blatantly that they won't do their job before.",

        "text": "So last year I went to our state's Renaissance festival with my then-boyfriend, his family, and some friends.\n\nWe heard an announcement that the fair would be closing in 10 minutes, so, because we knew we were pretty far from the exit, we decided to start heading that way so we wouldn't be lingering after close.\n\nWhile we were walking, my boyfriend and I were playing around a bit childishly I'll admit (We got caught up in the fair a bit, haha), and I was running away from him (making sure that nobody was around to run into, of course). Now, this is an outdoor fair and the ground is all sandy. So my dumb ass slips and falls, and I land hard on my face. \n\nMy boyfriend and his family sit me on a bench, and we realize that I'm bleeding pretty badly from my chin and forehead, and my leg is bleeding too. Somehow I hurt my ankle, but I don't really know how, tbh. A guy in a nearby restaurant-booth-thingy who saw the incident hurried over and asked if I was okay. He saw the blood and cuts and told us to wait while he went and got a first aid kit. He was very kind about it. He came back and I proceeded to wipe the blood from myself and position enough paper towels (bandaids weren't working, and it was a very barebones FA kit) to stem the bleeding long enough to get outside the gates of the fair. I was also wearing a $200 dress (gifted to me by his mother) that I was trying to figure out how to keep blood off of. We told the gentleman that we would get me cleaned up and that he could get back to work, as I imagine he had a lot to do judging by the tables near his booth-thingy.\n\nAt about 6:04pm (The fair closed at 6), a woman came over to us and said in a rude tone, \"The fair is closed and you need to leave.\" \n\nMy boyfriend's mom was kind of stunned and gestured to me. \"I'm sorry, my daughter (which I was basically at that point, god I miss that woman) was just injured and we're trying to-\"\n\n\"The fair closed at six, and everyone needs to leave.\"\n\nSo I, who when I feel like I'm in trouble immediately panic, said that I was fine and let's just get going, guys. We get up and start walking to the exit, admittedly a bit slow since I'm trying to stem bleeding from four different places with two hands, and my ankle is killing me to boot. This woman starts _following us_. She's literally tailgating my group, right on our asses, the whole way out of the park.\n\nIt starts hurting to walk after awhile, and I literally have tears streaming down my eyes as I try to keep walking on it. My boyfriend is carrying my bag and several other things that we can't leave, his mom obviously can't carry me, and our other friend is blind, so yeah, that wasn't happening. Hell, if she woulda just let us sit for a minute, my boyfriend coulda ran the stuff to the car and brought the car back to pick me up close to the exit. Maybe woulda taken ten mins tops (he's a fast runner). We even pass a few other groups who are still dawdling, but they are of no concern to this lady. \n\nAs we got near the gate, I said, I'll admit in quite a bitchy voice, \"I apologize for inconveniencing you. I'll be sure not to bleed on anything on the way out.\"\n\nNow, normally when these things happen, I try to be understanding that they have a job to do, that perhaps their managers are uptight, and that I am in the wrong by being there (4 minutes) after hours. But this time, and I know you guys will be the first to bitch me out if I'm wrong (love you), I think this woman was just a bitch. She could see I was bleeding, she saw I was _crying_ in pain, but fuck if she would allow us to sit for ten minutes and still have the fair cleared out by 6:15-6:20.\n\nAlso, for the record, I do take the blame for acting foolishly at the fair (I was 20 years old at the time but felt 10), but jfc, people were dancing and singing and skipping and I got caught up in it.",

Clover selects his Incense and we head to the counter to wait. The woman was receptive enough to see us waiting but didn't put her phone down. Still shouting on her phone she ignores Clover and I and rings up his incense. Only pausing her conversation to glare at us and tell us the total. Once the transaction is done she walks off. Never putting the phone down and never lowering her voice and never acknowledging us aside from the total.\n\nClover and I browse some more before leaving. I mean this is a chill store. There's no anti-theft things so lots of people steal from it and the staff has never been helpful or great. But I've never dealt with someone shrieking on her phone non-stop.

He was yelling at the employee to \"shut up\". I looked him in the eye and said \"You need to shut up\". He swung around and gave me an evil look, then turned back to the employee and became aggressive to the point where she was leaning back in the corner away from him.\n\nHer manager arrived and summed up the situation instantly. He put the guy's bags back behind the counter, told him he would be getting no service and to leave the store immediately.\n\nThe angry guy slammed his trolley into the counter and began to storm out, but then turned on the manager and tried to physically assault him (because the manager was also of Indian heritage). \n\nThankfully, no one ended up getting hit and the guy left.

However, I didn't hesitate to speak out at the time even though the abusive guy was twice my size. \n\nIf we don't speak out, we are not sending the right message to people like that.\n\nI left my name and phone number with a third employee (also Indian) just in case the employees needed a witness. Another customer did the same.\n\nRacial abuse is NOT acceptable. Always challenge it.\n\n[Edit: It wasn't as simplistic as I wrote in my post; the abuse aimed at the employee and me was significant. I just truncated it for the post. The message is still clear.]\n",

        "text": "I typed this up for an /r/AskReddit comment and thought this probably belonged here as well.  \n\nLocation: International airport, after security, 2 hours to wait until our 8 hour overnight flight. It's Friday night so everywhere's busy. 25 minute wait to get in, that's fine. After ordering our drinks it takes 10 minutes before the waiter takes our food orders. Pot roast for my wife, chicken pot pie for me. He tells me not to order the chicken pot pie and recommends the shepherd's pie. Fair enough, I order that.\n\n30 minutes later, no food. Any questions are answered with \"It's on its way\" and a smile. 10 minutes later: \"There's been a mix up in the kitchen, what did you order?\" 15 minutes later, our food arrives.\n\nThe pot roast is OK if a bit cold, the shepherds pie is gross. A half inch of oil at the bottom of the dish, no other juices, just a bright orange oil. The waiter insists that is how it is meant to be. \"I know what a Shepherds Pie is supposed to look like, and that's not it\". He takes the plate away without further comment. 5 minutes pass and we don't see our waiter.\n\nWe call for the manager and explain what's going on and that we hadn't even been asked if we wanted it remade or a different dish. The waiter suddenly appears being defensive. \"I was just about to ask what they wanted to do\", he says. \"What have you got that can be in front of me in 5 minutes?\" \"Nothing. Maybe a salad.\" says the manager. \"Fine, I'll have a Caesar salad with chicken breast\" \"No, it'll take 25 minutes to cook the chicken. I can maybe get another one of those out in 5 minutes\", gesturing at the pot roast.\n\n\"That will do. I'll have pot roast\". Because of how long we've been hanging around, I've finished my drink, so the waiter asks me if I want another. \"Sure\", I sigh.\n\nThe manager brings my food and beer and I ask for the check as we are by now running it close for our flight. The food is just about acceptable, and it was too late to complain anyway. I have about 2 sips of my second beer because we're rushing. The check doesn't arrive, so we have to flag down the waiter who has been avoiding the table since the re-order. He stands over the POS with the manager for a few minutes then drops the check.\n\nI look over it: 2 pot roasts, 2 beers for me and one for my wife. The full amount is charged. My wife is absolutely fuming, possibly the angriest I've ever seen her. Damn right I stiff the waiter. He can take his tip out of the food charges that would have been comped in any other restaurant.\n\nWhat's really annoying is that we ate in the downtown branch of the same restaurant a week earlier and had one of the best meals of the holiday; funny, friendly and attentive wait staff giving great service, awesome food and the server thanked us for a great tip on the way out.",

I tell him I'm going to grab my card and shit the door and fetch it.\n\nI show him my card and he notices my bus pass ID and tells me that will work as long as it has a name and picture.

It didn't even register to me how bizzare it really was until my brother who was standing by me as it happened also said something about how weird he was acting.\n\nAnyone have anything like this happen to them before? Any reason why my ID and card was required to be shown to a pizza Delivery guy? This has never happened to me ever and I've ordered ALOT of pizza lol.",

        "text": "This happened several years ago, but still has me shaking my head. I was living in a rural area at the time, about 6 miles from the closest grocery store. This store was in a very small town full of meth heads, a 45 minute drive from anything resembling a \"city.\" It was a no-name, family-owned store that carried the minimum it could and still deserve to be called a grocery store. The produce was always well past its prime. You get the idea... \n\nI stopped at said store on my way home from work and bought (among other things) one single potato. When I checked out, I see that the potato rang up at $8 (yes, EIGHT) and change. \n\nMe: Excuse me, how much was that potato?\nClueless cashier: $8 whatever. \nMe: *Stunned silence.*\nCC: (I swear she had an 80s Valley Girl accent)  It's 'cuz it's organic...\nNow at this point I realized that yes, I accidentally put it in an organic bag. My bad. Still, I don't care if this fucking potato had been planted, grown and picked by Rachel Carson herself, it should not be eight dollars for one damn potato.\n\nI honestly don't remember how it got resolved, whether she fixed it or I just left without it, but I know I didn't pay it. Regardless, how can someone be so ignorant to think any single unprepared potato should reasonably cost that much? She worked in a grocery store, but had evidently never shopped in one.",

I started off on the right foot by accidentally creeping out the girl in front of me by leaning right over her shoulder and breathing on her neck while trying to read the menu (I have terrible eyesight). I still couldn't read it by the time I got to the counter, so I opened up with: \n\n&gt;Me: Hey there, can I get ahhhhh.... \n\nthen paused for about 30 seconds, still leaning over the counter and trying to read the menu items. Eventually I just gave up and asked \n\n&gt;Me: What is good here? \n\nThe lady at the cash rolled her eyes and sighed, then said \n\n&gt;L: The vanila bean frap \n\n&gt;Me: -happy to finally be able to place an order- Oh goodie, I'll have one of those \n\nAfter that exchange, she just stared at me for the longest time, getting increasingly annoyed looking before bursting out with\n\n&gt;L: Sir, what size do you want? \n\n&gt;Me: -puzzled- What sizes are available?\n\n&gt;L: Veni, grande and ___ *didn't hear*\n\nI have no idea what any of those words mean, so I just went with what I knew\n\n&gt;Me: Medium?\" \n\nshe sighs\n\n&gt;L: Alright, name? \n\n&gt;Me: Epic.\n\n&gt;L: Nebic?\n\n&gt;Me: Epic.\n\n&gt;L: Nebic?\n\n&gt;Me Epic...\n\n&gt;L: Nebic?\n\n&gt;Me: -raising my voice- EPIC!\n\n&gt;L: Alright, alright, sheesh i got it -writes Nebic on the cup- Will that be all?\n\nAt this point, I should have abandoned ship, just said yes and gotten on with my life, but like the moron I am I pressed forward.\n\n&gt;Me: Uhmmm... do you guys sell food here? (may I stress that there was a huge line behind me?) \n\n&gt;L: -after 5 seconds of pausing to glare at me- Yes. we do... what do you want?\n\n&gt;Me: What do you have? \n\nShe pointed to a box full of display items right next to me which I hadn't noticed, embarrassed, I leaned over to read the names of the items. \n\n&gt;Me: I'll have the... -I paused again because I couldn't read any of the tiny writing again, however, the larger text on the big ticket items stuck out enough to read- Monteray jack on egg? \n\n&gt;L: We are out of that.\n\n&gt;Me: The pumpkin spice scone? \n\n&gt;L: Out of that\n\n&gt;Me: The pumpkin spice muffin?\n\n&gt;L: Out of that \n\n&gt;Me: Then what do you have?! \n\nOnce again, she pointed at the box so, I said \n\n&gt;Me: Just give me a sandwich with meat and cheese please\" \n\n&gt;L: Like a double smoked bacon?\n\n&gt;Me: Have any of that? -she nods- Give me one please!\n\n&gt;L: -turns to grab it then stops- Oh wait, sorry sir we are actually out of them... but we do have a double smoked bacon on egg\n\n&gt;Me: -exasperated- Can I get that please?!\n\n&gt;L: Sure. will that be all?\n\nI will not repeat what I said in response to that, but after paying, I shuffled off to the side of the stand and waited for my food and drink to be ready. The lady behind me, dressed in fairly nice shoes (which I later got quite acquainted with) ordered a veni sized thingy with soy bean, no fat, extra sugar and a bunch of other stuff I dont understand then stood next to me. At this moment I heard \n\n&gt;L: Vanilla bean frap for Nebic?\n\n&gt;C: -defeated- That would be me...\n\nI reached out to grab the cup, then turned to leave when I slammed the cup into the wall next to me and spilled half the frap onto the hipster girl's shoes, she squealed and I panicked, then tried to grab napkins to clean up. However, I ended up pulling the entire dispenser off the table and onto the floor with a loud crash, sending napkins everywhere. Still panicking, I picked up a handful of napkins out and started wiping her shoes down while she glared at me, then I wiped the floor quickly before shuffling off with what is left of my frap... whoops...",

That said I need to get my shitty experience with them off my chest so here goes. Went in today to trade in some old games because they're having a extra 60 percent trade in credit deal this weekend. Bought Forza 4 and Ridge Racer 6 used and went home. Got home the Forza 4 play disc won't work. Call them back to let them know it's defective only to find out that was their last copy. This is the second time in less than a month I had to return some I bought there used because it's defective. The first time I bought mlb the show 15 on ps4 used and there was a chunk missing out of the disk! I wish made that up but it's the bible truth. I know video game store pays shit and gives 2 fucks about their employees but have at least a little pride in your job. How hard is it to check a disc when you accept a trade In? I worked at Video game store back in the day so I know what I speak. Any who returned both games got my cash back on the second game and got credit for Forza 4. Had to buy a game I didn't really want because I'm not coming back to this store again ever and didn't want to have useless store credit. Thank God for Digital, and other online shopping sites. I'll pay a few bucks more to get a working game and not have to deal with these idiots. The guy behind the counter even had the gaul to ask me if I wanted to preorder anything after I was inconvenienced and had to waste an hour of my day coming back up there because they can't do their jobs properly. Oh and I found copies of both forza 3 and 4 complete on ebay for 16 shipped. Two bucks less than the defective copy of Forza 4 they tried to sell me that was just the discs.",

        "text": "I don't fly a whole lot any more, but since I volunteer with the Red Cross, I was asked to deploy from my home in Las Vegas to help out with the flood recovery in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The flights I took to reach Baton Rouge were uneventful, but on the return trip, where I flew from Baton Rouge to Houston and changed planes there for a larger plane to Las Vegas. The short flight from Baton Rouge was also uneventful, but then comes the flight from Houston to Las Vegas. When I got my boarding passes for both flights, I was warned that the Houston-Las Vegas segment was overbooked, and would I like to volunteer to be bumped, in return for a voucher for a future trip and get on the next available flight. I said what the heck, and checked the box on the screen. This is not the \"odd\" part I'm writing about.. Most people who've flown on any airline in the past are aware of the briefing that the flight attendants give prior to take off.. Seat belts, all personal electronics OFF, seats upright, trays up... You know the drill..\n\n\nWell on this flight, there was a guy across the isle from me, one row up and in an isle seat as I was.. No sooner than he sat down in his seat, he whipped out a large tablet computer and proceeded to bring up a movie. I figured as soon as the flight attendants made their sweep down the isle, after their little talk, they'd shut him down cold.. First attendant walks by, alternately looking at both sides of the isle. and either misses OR ignores the guy.. During the time between push-back at the gate and taxiing to the runway for takeoff, there were at least 4 more passes of a flight attendant. I'm wondering.. Are they blind or just don't really care that this guy paid no attention to their safety briefing? \n\nTo make a long story short, all the way from Houston to Las Vegas, close to 3 hours in the air, he was watching some movie on the tablet. This included when we were on approach to Las Vegas, when they sweep through the cabin again to check seatbelts and other things... Once again this guy kept right on watching whatEVER he was watching on the tablet and didn't stop until we were stopped at the gate in Las Vegas... By this time, I got the distinct impression that this airline (or at least this cabin crew) only paid lip service to the safety briefing they spout all the time.. I went to the airline's website and wrote them a letter with date/flight number/seat I was in &amp; seat the man was in. \n\nThis is a major airline, one which recently *united* with another large airline making an even LARGER airline...\n",

There are others waiting elsewhere in case his presence at the front of the store doesn't work.\n\nI nod to him, he nods to me, but I don't want to distract him by asking about his discount.  I'm there, I may as well shop for a few things, which I grab and head to the self check-out.\n\nThe customer in front of me is a young woman, attractive, looks to be about college age.  She gets to the register, dumps a few things onto the scanner, but I notice the perfume that was in her basket is now in her bag.  *Oh crud,* I'm thinking, *I'm right next to the shoplifter.*\n\nSo I decide to be chivalrous, or give her a clue, or just meddle for no reason.  My brain decided it was not going to do the thinking.\n\n\"You gonna pay for that?\" I asked.\n\nShe turned around and gave me that look, the one that is intended to melt your skull.  \"What business is that of yours?\"\n\n*Seriously?*  I'm trying to throw her a clue, that *maybe she might not want to try shoplifting today*, and yes, I'm being dumb, because it wasn't until later that I realized I was jeopardizing my friend's position.

They'd had a couple of members of a theft ring show up and sent him out as a deterrent, but they left without purchasing anything, or any other members of the ring showing up.  As he told me, that probably means they saw that they were being watched, and decided today was not a good day to steal.  They did catch the young woman, but she stole less than $50 in merchandise and the store decided it wasn't worth their time to press charges.",
