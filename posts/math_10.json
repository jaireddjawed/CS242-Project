I dunno if my institution is particularly bad, but no dedicated stats was required of us, all the stats I took was optional. So I guess my math advice would be something along the lines of \"take stats and take it seriously, even if you are not a STEM major\"",

Even a small moment of thought about how alone I would be most of the time and have no one to understand nor support that I want to be excel and follow my math passion makes me really lose all motivation and feel like I'm fooling myself like I'm not happy with what I do and what I am or whatever.\n\nTldr: I want math friends that I can meet and interact.

I'm assuming it has to due with whether or not the discriminant (b^2-4ac) is a square, so one could apply the quadratic formula, but then how would one generalize it to higher degree polynomials? And besides that, it feels like there's something deeper that I'm missing. \n\nIs the quadratic reciprocity law really about factoring polynomials?

It seems to have nothing to do with the more \"elementary\" definition of conditional probability which is conditioning on another RV. And I'm confused about whether it can replace the more \"elementary\" conditional probability.\n\nSay, for example, we have a machine-learning language model to predict the next word given a set of previous words. The output of a neural network `y` can be viewed as a conditional probability conditioning on the inputs `(x_1,...,x_n)` as `P(y|x_1,...,x_n)`. Which makes perfect sense to me. But how would I rephrase all these in terms of sigma algebra? Is it beneficial or even possible to express them in the measure theory framework anyway? And are there any resources that I should check?",

Basically, im researching the connections between discrete and continuous distributions, trying to make a road map between them. (I know there are already a ton of resources out there, but the classes I took didn't really focus much on how the distributions interact with eachother so I'm having a lot of fun working out the connections). \n\nOne of the connections I was researching was moving from a Bernoulli distribution to a Binomial distribution. I know in essence you can add up the individual bernoulli trials to reach a binomial distribution, but another method I found was using their moment generating functions to connect them. I remember reading somewhere that if you can figure out what distribution function a random variable follows based off of the MGF. \n\nI thought about this more, im assuming this implies that every probability distribution must have a unique moment generating function. Being in both real and complex analysis this semester, I've seen methods of proving uniqueness and wondered if, in any way, it could be applied to prove the uniqueness of MGFs. I asked my professor who is overseeing my undergraduate research, but she said it was almost common sense and that I didn't need to focus on it too much.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Is it pretty much common sense and should I move on, or do you think it would be worth it to look into a proof and maybe tie it in to my project somehow?",

I decided to check the top scores on SAT gender ratio and I found a ratio of 2:1 at 780 in 2015, with the ratio getting smaller every year (1983 it was 13.5:1 at 700+, then dropped to 1.65:1 in 2015 at 700+). It seems to me like it was affected by societal/cultural factors since there was a change in the scoring ratio. Honestly I find the claim that you need a drastically high IQ to participate to be exaggerated. This came from a so called gold medal winner, but they didn't show any actual evidence or proof of the IQ tests. \n\nMy questions are:\n\nDo you need an extremely high IQ?\n\nAre there less women because they're simply less smart? Or is it due to interest in the field?",
