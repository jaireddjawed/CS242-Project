I want to do my part in pushing these ideas into the mainstream—and I think this book can help—but I'm afraid nobody is going to get to the end.\n\nIf there's anybody here who likes to read fiction, I could really use another set of eyes on the story. I'd like to cut out another 10-15,000 words before I publish in March... and I need to make sure everything is clear and easy-to-read.\n\nSynopsis:\n\n*Jonathon Nightly is an ambitious, kind-hearted construction worker who falls for Hannah Lasker, a gifted artist on the verge of a meltdown. Their new relationship is put to the test with the announcement of a controversial vaccine that grants the user eternal life. This \"miracle cure\" is only the beginning of a true-to-life technological revolution that pits friendship against progress, science against faith, and love against time.*\n\n*From a subtle drama set in 1970s Chicago to the perils of the distant future, The Day I Wore Purple escalates rapidly into a mind-blowing tapestry of unrequited love and colliding galaxies.*\n\n[Cover art](http://imgur.com/FUwWl84) (still working on the design).\n\n[Here's the PDF on GoogleDocs.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_5HMOYFypTGRTd4eUM5UE5aakU/view)\n\nIt won't be line-edited until just before publishing, so please forgive any spelling or grammar mistakes.\n\nAny thoughts or encouragement would be greatly appreciated!",

        "text": "Completely new here and not particularly informed about the subject of transhumanism, but I decided to come on this forum to ask some questions about a thought that just popped into my mind, and that I find particularly interesting.\n\nWhat would happen if we could stretch the visible light spectrum of the human eye through transhumanism? What would we *experience*? \n\nWould we see the same colours, i.e. red through violet but stretched over a larger spectrum? In other words, this would entail that if we could see wavelengths from e.g. 1 pm to 100 km (I don't think it would be useful in this particular scenario, but just for example's sake), then we would see gamma rays as red, radio-waves as violet, and our current visible spectrum as something in between (given the length of the stretch and the relatively tiny size of the visible spectrum, every colour we see with our current simian eyes would likely appear as a single colour to this theoretical transhuman, hence the impracticality aforementioned due to how confusing it would be).\n\nOr will we experience entirely new, unimaginable colours to add on to our current experience (the way we experience the visible spectrum remains unchanged and we \"unlock\" new colours that our brains could not even begin to imagine before)?\n\nHas this been discussed by scientists and specialists? Perhaps even philosophers? Is there even any way we *could* know the answer to these questions until we actually test it on ourselves in the future? I can imagine that if it were to be the second case rather than the first, then the transhumans would be unable to explain to us with mere words the new colours they are able to experience, just as we are unable to explain what \"blue\" looks like. \"Qualia\" I believe is the appropriate word to describe this phenomenon (thanks vsauce). The only way to discover what this person is experiencing would be to also transhumanise ourselves. \n\nIt basically all comes down to whether colour and the electromagnetic spectrum have some kind of a universal property to them, or if it's all about how each brain \"decides\" to interpret the information (if at all) to translate it into conscious experience. \n\nAnyway, sorry if this post might look dumb to some of you more knowledgeable people, I think I'll start to look more into the subject of transhumanism as it really interests me quite a lot for its vast possibilities. \n\nEdit: Or perhaps I'm over-thinking this way too much and we'll just implant devices such as infra-red cameras and the likes and see the information through their lenses rather than edit the way our own brains perceive electromagnetic frequencies. Still a fun mind exercise to explore these different theories. ",

By googling I can find a lot of technology for hearing aids, but nothing so far for e.g. giving people perfect pitch or allowing people to pick out sounds at a longer distance, or cut out background noise. Any suggestions for further reading ?",

        "text": "This is *not* a discussion on the *range* of color vision.  When most people think of this topic, they think about the *range* of color vision (i.e., being able to see infrared, ultraviolet, and beyond).\n\nI don't really care about that as much, as it has been talked about to death.  I am more interested in the *dimensionality* of color vision (to which we are currently limited to 3).\n\n---\n\nIf you are learned in linear algebra, [read this first.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_vision#Mathematics_of_color_perception)  Alternatively, read this less technical TL;DR:\n\nReal colors are made out of a mixture of light of various wavelengths.  A color can be composed of any number of wavelengths of light, but the human eye only has 3 types of cells for color perception\n\nAs such, human perception of color is extremely limited in compared to the real colors.  For example, if you see light that you perceive as yellow, you have no idea of knowing whether it is actually pure yellow light, or a combination of pure red and green light.\n\nThis also explains why red-green colorblindness restricts how many colors a color-blind person can perceive.  Okay, technically red-green colorblind people do have 3 cones, but the red and green cones overlap so much that they might has well be regarded as being dichromatic (2 cones).  \n\n---\n\nThe first step to giving humans superior color vision would naturally be to add more types of cones to the eyes, and of course make sure the visual cortex could process that information.  Many currently living animals already have color vision that goes beyond trichromacy (see [mantis shrimp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantis_shrimp#Eyes)).\n\nOne could imagine that some day the eye (or camera or whatever) and brain could be engineered to have color vision equivalent to having thousands of types of cones.  If you read the mathematical article above, what I am imagining is color vision that could be accurately described by a Hilbert space.\n\nI imagine post-humans with eyes that are basically doing spectroscopy in every section of vision.  If you want to read more about existing technology (not related to human vision), see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspectral_imaging)\n and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy).\n\n---\n\nNote that what I am talking about here is the *dimensionality* of color vision, not the *range* of color vision.  In other words, even if a post-human was still blind to colors beyond infrared and ultraviolet like we are, higher dimensional color vision would still open up an entire new world of vision.  Of course we could expect post-human vision to include a higher range (and precision) of color vision as well.",

According to some estimates, this technology could produce advantages such as a 24.3 IQ point gain from simply selecting 1 embryo out of 1000 different possibilities. The cumulative limits of this kind of selection are unknown, but if the trend remains consistent for several consecutive generations we could see over a 100 points in IQ gain.\nUnlike raw human genetic engineering, embryo selection is not too far from our current capabilities. With experts estimating the availability of this technology within the century are there any ethical reasons this technology should not be pursued? It's likely that this kind of selection would be an expensive procedure in its earliest forms. What kind of socio/economic division could we expect?\nhttp://www.nickbostrom.com/papers/embryo.pdf",

I'm guessing many people in here feel the same way.\n\nSo I'm seriously starting to look into cryogenic preservation when I die (I'm in my early 40s and my family tends to live pretty long, so barring accidents or untimely poor health, I'm guessing I've got some time to plan).  \n\nI realize that it's a highly imperfect technology and that realistically there's a vanishingly small chance that my consciousness would survive the freezing process and storage, but \"vanishingly small\" is better than \"zero\". \n\nFrom what I've found, though, even if all goes smoothly, there's still lag time between when you push off and when someone gets around to removing and freezing your head.\n\nWhat are the politics, rules, and considerations about maintaining complete control over the time and place of freezing?  Assuming a jurisdiction where suicide is legal, is there any precedent for ending one's own life in a way that does not damage the brain / allows a smooth transition to preservation?  This seems especially relevant in case of a diagnosis of something like early onset dementia or terminal cancer.",

So I've started a Discord server with the purpose of creating a place where we can have real-time conversations surrounding mind uploading (well, mostly mind uploading).\n\n[Mind Uploading Discord server invite link](https://discord.gg/0hvQiKq6POPuVF0L).\n\nI'll try to be online as much as I can to chat with people, however, I always have lots of work to do for the organization, so I won't always be able to get back to everyone. There will be other people you can talk to though.\n\n---\n\nIf you're wondering, the organization is [Lifetimes Infinity](http://www.lifetimesinfinity.com). We started as /r/Digital_Immortality. I won't be talking about organization/business stuff in mind uploading discord server general chat unless prompted (to try to keep the discussions just about mind uploading).",
