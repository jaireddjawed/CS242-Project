        "text": "So this guy ordered a typical order of pizza and wings timed for 5 PM through our website. Whether you order it without a set pick-up time or not, our website says it (should) be available for pickup in 15-20 minutes. \n\nSo being the meathead this guy is, he comes in 10-15 minutes after he ordered it. So about 4:35 this guy rolls in, and asks about his order. I realize it's only been in the system for 15 minutes so I nicely tell him it will be ready at 5. This guy starts complaining, \"Ive never had to wait more than 15 minutes for wings and a pizza!\" And so on. At this point we've already had to explain many times why it's not ready. He's just not catching on\n\nAfter fifteen minutes of this guy pacing in-and-out of the shop we just gave him his food and let him leave in a fuss. \n\nSome people just don't get it. We did everything we could to help this guy by dropping the wings early and making the pizza early as well. He confused a lot of people in the shop, and made us realize how ignorant people can really be. \n\nEdit: a lot of people are picking his side, which is okay. Honestly. But I'd like to add that also on the receipt, it states whether or not the order is timed, but it is not in the same area as the \"15-20 minute wait\" message. \n\nTL;DR: \n\nA man manually (online) placed an order for food for 5 o'clock. (This would rarely be a mistake because when you finish an order it asks if you would like for it to be timed and you have to choose a time AND confirm it.) He came into the pizza shop and complained about how his 5 o'clock order was not ready at 435. We immediately made is food earlier than expected and were not once rude. But he on the other had was. \n\nNot here to start a war, just here to say some people don't pay attention or take into consideration that they mistakes were made. \n\nEdit 2: I am the delivery driver. I had just gotten back to the shop right as he got there. ",

        "text": "So as a little side note, my old friend who was a manager gave me his manager shirts. Since then, people have been seeing me as kind of an \"honorary manager.\" I've kind of always been a person that people will go to for help since I generally have my shit together and im also one of the more approachable people.\n\nThis doesn't mean anything but it's a little tidbit that may or may not show how people see me.\n\nSO\n\nSo our general manager, probably being too busy being balls deep in an 18 year old, hasn't hired any more managers after 2 quit to pursue better jobs. Mind you that one of them left before I went to Europe (so sometime in May) and the other left the week after I got back (so like 3 weeks ago). We MAY have some people that will start next week, but they need to go through \"manager training\" aka a MONTH of some bullshit.\n\nSo my managers ask for days off. This means that on the schedule, we have literally no closing manager on sunday. I'm thinking either our GM is going to stay there the entire day or we're just gonna be fucked.\n\nTurns out that they bring someone in from another store. Whatever, I don't give a shit, I just have to just take it and deal with it.\n\nSo I come in and even though I'm working an insider shift, I immediately start driving. This is fantastic as I am a huge slut for driving.\n\nFirst order is a fucking kid that takes 5 minutes to get to the door, and I even tell him \"yeah if you wanna get you parents to si-\" \"no i can sign it\" and stiffs me like the piece of shit that kids are.\n\nSo it sucks. But my manager keeps me going, even when it's a little unreasonable (as in there's only like 2 orders on the screen btu he still lets me drive even though other drivers may or may not come back soon). So that's really nice. I don't get much interaction with the manager other than that sometimes he'll tag me out, which is... okay I guess since there's not really any doubles happening.\n\nIt's a pretty okay day, but a few hours in I start noticing things getting weird\n\nThis manager is one of those stereotypical \"chubby gay mexican guy from southern california\" types. Which is really fun when you're just hanging out with them but I slowly start noticing that he gets really sassy with me.\n\nAnd by sassy I mean moreso kind of bossy and I can't tell if he's being sassy or being a dick.\n\nIt starts off with this little interaction\n\nM: Manager\nC: me\n\n&gt;M: Hey... so... you're flex, right?\n\n&gt;C: yeah\n\n&gt;M: So what does that mean?\n\n&gt;C: Uhhh... It means I can drive or be an insider\n\n&gt;M: Sooo. . . yeah uhh... I'm gonna need help with the dishes now, soo\n\nI'm not sure if he genuinely didn't know what a flex person was or if he was trying too hard to dance around saying \"yo, go unavailable and help me with dishes since it's not as busy.\" But whatever.\n\nI do that before taking a few more deliveries\n\nFirstly, I take an order with just wings and a cookie and a soda. Weird order, but whatever. Turns out that the family orderered some pizzas as well\n\nI usually panic at this point. I haven't forgotten things in a while and I'm not going to start now. But I look at the receipt and see there's no pizza. I give it to them and I say \"yeah you guys ordered online so yeah\"\n\nOf course I get the spiel of \"oh what the fuck the website sucks it always has problems it always has issues i hate this omg fuck you im not giving you a fucking tip until I get my entire god damn order (as if it's my fault that you can't read a fucking confirmation page or call in and confirm your order)\"\n\nhusband already wrote a $3 on the card though so lmfao thanks\n\nAnyways, the real shit doesn't happen until I begin doing prep. I notice very quickly that the walk-in is looking VERY empty. When I finished doing my portion of prep at 7:30, we had a total of 11 pan pizzas in our walk-in (plus whatever was in R4R).\n\nour store was open for many more hours. I remember a similar incident that I might type up one day, about when the cooks never told my manager that they were low on dough. The person that was responsible for that is a stripper now so that's cool.\n\nAnyways\n\nSo I joke with Sloth Man (R) (who is for some reason doing the major portion of prep even though he is Sloth Man) that \"oh jeez we're fucked\", and I contemplate telling the manager this.\n\nSo I eventually decide to tell him. I word it as such\n\n&gt;C: \"Hey man! I noticed we're running low on pan dough, do you want me to emergency prep some more?\"\n\n&gt;M: \"Nah man that's not your job, don't worry about it\"\n\nSo that's happening. I figure there's a lot in the R4R or something. Which like there is but it's still SUPER empty. There's nothing wrong with having a good amount of \"just in case\" dough proofed that you can just use for R4R tomorrow or something. At LEAST pan dough.\n\nSo things are going... decently. I'm getting decent tips, taking a lot of deliveries, until I see my manager access the \"we're out of shit\" screen and tpye in stuff.\n\nMe, being curious, decide to check it out, and open an order\n\n\"We are out of Large and Medium pan, and Medium Hand Tossed\"\n\nholy shit.\n\nFlashbacks are coming back to me. How the FUCK do we run out of dough?! the ONLY time it's happened it was because the cooks were fucks and never told the manager\n\nBut I know that this manager was being a fuck because he was THERE on the cook line, and I TOLD him about it!\n\nDuring this time (and starting a little before), he starts getting VERY micromanaging.\n\nFor instance, I was working on getting some wings in the pan. There's a certain priority that we have in our store.\n\n1) whatever we're immediately doing (As in, whatever we're doing until we can reasonably stop. So it's not just \"prep\" it's \"finishing the pizza you're prepping before you help someone\")\n2) Customers / Phones\n3) Immediate warnings (ie. fryer being done)\n4) Cut Table\n5) a line of other shit that's not relevant.\n\nSo I'm doing these wings for a delivery that's waiting to be dispatched, when a customer walks in. I go to finish the wings, and I say \"Hello, we'll be right with you, sir!\"\n\nOur store was remodeled so they can all see inside, so they SEE that we're working, and not just lounging around.\n\nBut lo and behold the manager comes out barking\n\n&gt;M: NOW!\n\n&gt;C: \"Yeah man I-I-I\" (I have a stuttering impediment so I get stuck on this word)\n\n&gt;M: \"NOW\"\n\nIn case you were curious, he wanted us to break his $50. Not buying anything either.\n\nShit like this happens the entire time. \"CDFReditum, Wingstreet!\", \"CDFReditum, Customer!\"\n\nThis bugs me because I cherish my store in that the managers are VERY hands off. And when they want me to do stuff, it's always \"Hey CDFReditum, can you prep these for me?\" and they're fine with me getting to it when I finish what I'm doing. So getting bossed around by someone who has literally only been here for a few hours is a little shitty.\n\nBut anyways, to the main event. We have literally no pizza. We have thin crust, but there are a SHIT TON of orders on the screen.\n\nFor some reason the manager is very unwilling to go to the phones. Even when I offer to take over what he's doing, he's just like \"why?\"\n\nLike, we joked EARLIER today that \"haha don't worry it's not your job to deal with shitty customers, you didn't sign up for it\"\n\nBut now here I am having to take the fall because his fuck ass didn't have enough medium pans to fill a SIX PIZZA ORDER. So now I'm talking with someone who's having a huge dinner party and trying to figure out how to best help them.\n\nHe's implying that I should just tell them to fuck off and give them a $10 credit, but like, no.\n\nI'm NOT going to fuck over someone else' fucking day because you decided to be a little prick and not realize like \"hey, lets NOT prep any dough even though the person that everyone sees as kind of a manager mentioned \"hey, idk, maybe you should proof some\"\n\nSo what ends up happening is that we have a lot of large hand tossed so I just give them that, and give them a $30 credit (the price of 4 mediums with a coupon). Plus I hook them up with a shit ton of cheese and peppers and pretty much beg the driver to please please please not forget about them.\n\nLike, fuck me I don't give a shit about SALES, I'm not going to lose some shit over \"oh I only sold this pizza for $13 instead of $15\" but god dammit if I don't fucking hate having to hear people's day fucked over because of an easily preventable issue. Good god damn people should have to be lumped into \"the crazies\" because of some fuck's inability to listen for 2 god damn seconds and prepare for situations. \n\nIt's horrific and I hope this guy never comes back. I hope he stays at whatever fuckass store he came from and we get new competent managers. Even though I'm leaving the store in a week, I still care about people and I care that the service that I'm providing is top quality.\n\nI worked 7 days a week this fucking week, because I'm dedicated to this fucking job, I'm dedicated to working my ass off to deliver shit to people. I'm not in it for anything but the money, but god damn me when i'm clocked in, people better be getting the best damn service possible. It's not right for shitty things to happen to good people just trying to purchase a service, and it's not right that I can't do anything to stop it even when I try. This lies true for workers too, I hate seeing good people experience undue stress because of the mistakes of someone who doesn't give a shit. If my life weren't going in different directions, I'd make damn sure I was able to take the reigns of this store and make sure that problems like this were minimized.\n\nHis last question before I left for the night (after getting mad at me and telling me to \"HURRY UP\" because I wanted to grab some change from my car instead of breaking a 20 just for 32 cents)\n\n\"You working saturday?\"\n\nNot anymore, bitch.",

        "text": "Today at the beginning of my shift I had one of our rare out-of-town runs: an 86 pie order to be delivered to a BSA camp about 30 minutes away. \n\nMost of our drivers hate runs like that, but I don't mind for two reasons: 1, it's a $20 tip and we were *really* slow so that was significant enough to make up for being away for an hour, and 2, it meant I got a nice scenic drive and plenty of music time. \n\nSo I pull up Spotify for the trip there, and for anyone ~~living under a rock~~ not familiar with that app, it has a \"daily mix\" section that makes up different playlists automatically based on what you listen to. I've got a nerdcore list, a metal list, an indie acoustic list, and today I was listening to my Broadway list. It's mostly *Hamilton* because that was all I could listen to for a couple months, mixed with some *Dear Evan Hansen*, *Newsies*, what have you, along with some new stuff I hadn't heard yet.\n\nI get a little turned around on the way due to some really vague directions from my boss and being way out of my usual area, which for an order like this is a big deal. Stuff like this simply cannot be late. So I'm hustling a bit more than usual when I finally pull up to the camp, a solid ten minutes behind schedule. I'm in such a rush that I don't bother messing with my radio or turning off my car, I just scramble out and apologize as I dig the bags out of the trunk. \n\nThe kids are gathering around to grab the boxes and I do actually spare a moment to worry about the radio, but I dismiss it thinking the worst they'll hear is Lin-Manuel calling John Adams a fat motherfucker, since that was the last song I'd been listening to. \n\nThe kids start distributing the pizzas themselves and I go looking for the guy that needs to sign my receipt. It takes me a while to locate the guy in the crowd, especially when the scouts had for some reason decided that getting pizza delivered was a photo op. Eventually I locate the man who chews me out for being late and actually docks half my tip for the trouble. That's when I hear giggling coming from the direction of my car. \n\nI don't think anything of it, until what looked like a troop leader pipes up with \"Ma'am? Ma'am, could you... could you please turn off your radio?\"\n\nTurns out one of those new songs had popped up in the mix. My radio was blaring [*I Gave You a UTI* (NSFW)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ytnBRjmDXs), much louder than I even remembered leaving it. The kids were laughing their asses off. Half the adults looked livid, the other half looked like they were trying not to laugh. I lunged for my car and managed to turn off the radio right as the words \"my penis is the reason you may die, die, die\" were uttered.\n\nI apologized over and over and explained what had happened with my app, and they didn't call to complain.... but I don't know if they'll be calling again.

It was only skipped over once as the second part was still in the oven and starts yelling like \"I've seen this skipped over like 4 times!!! Just take it and go. You can't skip it anymore!\"\n\nResponded to him \"No it doubles with another thing as this is X customer that doesn't tip. That double is waiting on one thing and we aren't skipping it we are waiting. They are 1 minute apart and only 10 minutes old. That salad sat in the fridge for who knows how long before it was moved to the fridge, another 2 minutes isn't going to hurt it.\"\n\nHe continues to go on about about it being skipped over acting like nobody realized it was there, another employee other than me explains to him in almost the exact same manner \"Yes we know of it, it is a double as that is X customer and they go well together on the route planner.\" and he shuts up after that as apparently someone explaining identically to the way I do makes more sense to him. \n\nLater on in the day as I am heading back to help on dishes, he suddenly storms off from the dishes to the front computer grunting to the another employee just out of nowhere \"I better go up front before they try and fuck me out of my doubles\"\n\nWhy do I have to be stuck with lunatics like this? Most days are pretty organized and peaceful but this week has just been weird. Why won't they just... you know fire people like this? You're here to do a job. Not bitch because you aren't getting your way. I offer to take long distance deliveries for other drivers because my car gets such good gas mileage.

        "text": "So there's this guy, let's call him Dan. So Dan orders like 2-3 times a week on average, with breaks here and there, and never tips. His hair is short but spiked kind of like a troll doll. Almost every order he makes is trouble. All-in-all he's pretty much unforgettable.\n\n\n  A Little Context:\nSo Dan is your average bad customer. On many occasions, before we got our boss involved, he would pull the \"Oh, I can't seem to find my money bit.\" We allowed it the first few times, on the condition he come down to the store and pay (Obvious no tip), but after he failed to show for a week we gave him a warning (We live in a somewhat more trusting area (Yay Canada)). So he kept up his lost money act up until our boss had enough and gave him a second warning (Three and you're out!). \n\n\n  The Frustration:\nLast week he ordered again, through our call center, and we had to make the pizza. Just a normal order, nothing bad, not even a 2-Litre, takes about 20-minutes to make (We were taking our time. Slow night). So I'm already up at the place at about the 30-minute mark and I get this call from my cook. \"We got a call from the call centre saying that the customer called and said he wouldn't be home til midnight.\" *like 40 min from now.* I drive back pissed, time wasted, gas wasted, dishes dirty. I'm behind. We're both (My cook also drives) pissed at this guy. We decide to just keep the pizza under the heat lamp for the next half hour and drive it up later, which we do. I told our boss and Dan was given a THIRD warning but was allowed to continue ordering. Apparently three strikes and you're out doesn't apply here. \n\nBONUS!\nHe called the CALL CENTER to complain, not 5 minutes after delivery, about his COLD AND STALE pizza (I don't know about you, but my pizza doesn't generally go stale within an hour of completion (Under a heat lamp)). They actually gave him a credit for the order. *UNBELIEVEABLE*\n\n\n  The Pissed and the Furious:\nSo Dan orders again (On my night. Typical). and changes his order throughout us making it, twice. Already pissed. His order is almost ready and another prints (It's close). I wait for the double, in no way is Dan's getting his pizza early. I take the other order first, (It's closer) then head up to Dan about on time. I'm about to knock and spring the idea to knock WAY TOO LOUD (Keep in mind that it's almost midnight). He's answers super pissed and I play it off as \"The lights were off, I didn't see any proof of life close to the door.\" He buys it and I leave with the biggest grin on my face knowing I pissed him off one last time before I quit.\n\n\nTL;DR\nSome jackass, who constantly messes with us, ordered and I knocked WAY too loud to satisfy my own petty revenge obsession and pissed him off.",

It was my last delivery of the night and I couldn't wait to get home because I was so exhausted from the constant heat and my sore upper thighs (Hella squats). The temperature was 82 at 11pm when I reached the parking lot which has a little hallway that leads to the stairway of the building (4 flights in total). Getting in and out of my car was a pain in the ass and so was going up stairs. So as I get to the hallway a kid almost runs into me to talk to his parents outside in their cars. Both were in seperate cars, parked, and not even in a parking spot. Just like what you'd do in the side street with your hazards on. I slowly make my way to the top with each story getting hotter and less airflow. They ordered 2 pizzas and a 2 liter which isn't that bad. When I made it to the top I knocked a total of 5 times and rang the doorbell twice because I didn't want to have to go back to my car to call them. I was straight sweating up there and it was suffocating. Still nothing so I went back downstairs and at the bottom I passed by the kid again. I go to my car and call the number and it goes straight to voicemail. I said fuck it and went back to the store which is literally 2 blocks down. As I get back to the store, my manager gets off the phone and tells me why I didn't deliver their pizza. I told my side of the story and she just said to go back. So I do, and slowly make my way up again and knock on the door. It was the fucking kid I passed by twice who didnt even think to let me know it was his order. I said hey I passed by you like twice the first time I came here and all he said \"oh really?\" I wasn't really that pissed through whole ordeal but it was still pretty stupid to have to go through that. Also helps that I got tipped. ",

Fuck these people. \n\nFuck people in general who slow down to practically 0 mph while taking every turn. If  your car isn't slammed ass low, you have no damn excuse to be turning that slow and fucking up traffic. \n\nAnd these people who just dart out into traffic, WHAT THE HELL? I swear, these people don't even look both ways, they just turn straight into traffic. I'll be damned if these people don't have a death wish. \n\nAnd I understand that nobody wants to walk all the way to the cross light so they can safely cross the street. But just keep in mind, it's a lot harder to see a jaywalker running across the street in the dark then it is any other car, so you better run fucking quick.

As he turned to sign the receipt on the counter, I see the wall right next to the door. There's a light fixture that's partially out of the wall, and by the time it takes for him to sign I see about 5 or 6 cockroaches scurrying out of it.\n\nHe does not tip and I do not ask for my pen back.",

At one point he admitted that he knew a delivery was supposed to be up before the next two, but still bitched at me for not taking the two that was almost guaranteed no tip.\n\nAfter talking to the other drivers, turns out he was doing it to them too. One guy, probably in his 50s or so, just has this job as something to pass time with. He was very angry over the fact that he was starting to stress coming to work when he knew he was on the same shift as the Child.\n\nWell, the Child has since been fired. Did a no call no show and the gm put in the paperwork. The Child came in the next day for a morning shift and started bitching at the other driver, something along the lines of 'they need *two* drivers today? And the other driver just told him to go talk to the GM. Gm told him that there was nothing he could do since the paperwork was sent, but he could try applying there again in a few months. \n\nThings got so much better after he left, though honestly I'd already started looking for a new job because he made that one miserable. I found one right before he was fired, and am now out of the pizza delivering business.",

        "text": "Preface: When someone orders our small size pizza, they generally tip $1. Maybe it's the nature of college kids, maybe its the fact that it is crazy expensive for what you get, but either way I have gotten into the habit of placing a large pizza box (empty) under the small one for a couple reasons. First it keeps the pie centered in the bag, so it stays level more, second, I think maybe someone will see that I brought them their little baby pizza before the big money pie delivery on a double and tip a little more.\n\nI was taking this delivery to one of the nicer neighborhoods in our zone. I pull up, call the number, run up the stairs to the front door, and the guy lets me in the entryway to do the transaction. He was paying cash and there was more light inside the door then on the front step so it seems perfect. I go to pull the pizza out of the box and I feel a fairly empty feeling box, but figure it's a small pizza, no big deal and start pulling it out. I'm using the technique someone shared on here to look like a pro when removing the pizza, so I pull the back edge of the bag away while holding onto the box . . . and viola! The small pizza falls out of the bag upside down (box doesn't open) right on the customer's feet. I was still holding the big empty box, and I froze in the moment of Oh Shit! He looks down, opens it up and sees the toppings all shifted basically to other slices, making this half-and-half pizza more of a combination pie. \n\nI was most likely bright red, and apologizing, saying \"this is obviously no charge, I will be right back out with your replacement pizza.\" \n\nHe says, \"don't worry about it, I am going to eat this one, and I don't need any more pizza then this, here is a tip for your service\" as he hands me $4.\n\nI refuse to take the money, and tell him I have not earned it, and this is the first time I have dropped a pizza since I started delivering in January. He then forces the money into my hand and said, \"don't worry about it, I don't really mind much.\"\n\nAll I could do at that point was tell him I would credit is account in our computer so his next order would also be free. He seemed pretty astonished that I would do that, and as I turned to walk out the door his dog comes running straight for the door. \n\nI was so afraid I was about to lose this guy's dog as well as ruin his pizza, so I used my pizza bag to block the door while he got the collar in hand. \n\nWhen I got back to the shop I explained it to the manager and added a very descriptive note in the computer under his phone number, citing the free pizza and even put my name on it, so all the drivers could laugh at my misfortune.

We're constantly trying to hire drivers but do little to no advertising so applications come in about once every 3 months.\n\nSince we have such a small staff, you have to really fuck up to get fired. One girl no call no showed for a week straight and no one said a word. I've only seen two people fired in the 3.5 years I've worked there and that only happened because someone got punched in the face.\n\nBecause everyone sticks around for so long, there are usually a few people that just hate each other working the same shift, and that's exactly what happened when, let's call them Jim and Dwight, were working one morning. Dwight was a terrible manager that acted like he really believed in the company and Jim was a chill driver just in it for the quick cash but they'd both been working there for 5+ years. Until they got into an argument behind the counter with customers eating a few yards away. Dwight apparently thought this was a great time to punch the much larger Jim in the teeth, directly in view of cameras, customers, and cooks.\n\nThe best part is they were both at work the next day, and for about a week it seemed like the owner wasn't going to do anything about it. It wasn't until Jim threatened to file a lawsuit that they both got fired for their involvement.",

        "text": "In the mountains of NC, everyone lets their dogs run loose in their yard, street, neighborhood.  Nobody ever puts instructions on the tickets regarding dogs unless there's a real reason to.\n\n(Disclaimer:  I'm not the dog whisperer.  Always take necessary precautions to ensure your safety around dogs or animals.  There's no set formula that always applies to every situation)\n\nSo...  Usually when you roll up to a house with dogs in the yard, they'll bark like crazy, but they'd end up rolling onto their backs for a belly rub within seconds of exiting the car.  They make a lot of noise because, hey, you're in their territory and that's what dogs do. (See disclaimer above)\n\nI've been bitten two times making a delivery, and BOTH times, I didn't even know the dog was there.  The sneaky little bastards that truly wanted to bite me hid and didn't make a noise until they were right up on me.\n\nSo I arrive at the house I'm delivering to and the ticket says \"Stay in car, dogs.\"  I scan the area for dogs, and I see four ABSOLUTELY STUNNING snow white (I'm guessing) German Shepherds just lounging on the porch.  They are the most beautiful dogs I've ever seen in my life.  They're just straight chillin'. Their ears are laid back, a couple of their heads turn to notice me, then lay back down on their paws.  Nothing to worry about here, folks.\n\nNobody is coming outside, the dogs are calm AF, so I decide I'm going to go ahead and walk to the door.  As Alpha as I could, I exit the car and walk confidently toward the dogs.  They don't even care.  Who's a good boys??\n\nI'm about halfway between my car and the porch when it happened.  The door clumsily opens with a bit of a clatter, and this little little toddler in diapers steps out.  In the blink of an eye, all four of those white beasts are up on their feet and lined up shoulder to shoulder, squared off between me and that toddler.   The low-pitched guttural growl coming from the row of dogs is what nightmares are made of.\n\nI was a heartbeat from chucking the pizzas toward the dogs and high-tailing it back to my car, but my legs were frozen long enough for reason to overtake my flight instinct.  I backed slowly back to my open car door then QUICKLY jumped back in.\n\nA few seconds later, the mom comes out on the porch a little frantic...  I told them to tell you to stay in the car!  I hope they told you!  I'm so sorry!\n\nFFS man.  If the ticket says to stay in the car, stay in the damn car.\n\n",

        "text": "I'm new here, and I'm sure I'll end up unlocking a few of these memories from the vault:  This is the time I saw my car doing donuts in the parking lot.\n\nThis happened years ago.  Motorcycle Rally in town a couple times a year.  Big night for pizza drivers in my small town in the mountains of NC.   Drunk bikers EVERYWHERE.  \n\nWe had this one motel (door entries are on the outside).  It was three stories tall and didn't have an elevator--or stairs.  To get to the second floor, you walk up this ramp that goes around the back of the building.  On the second floor balcony, you can see out over the parking lot, then you walk around the back side of the building again to get to the third floor, where you can see out over the parking lot again.\n\nIt was pre 9/11 and I lived in a small town where you never bothered locking your car, your house at night, etc.  It was no big deal to roll up to a delivery and leave your car running in the parking lot while making your delivery--or so I thought.\n\nWhen I arrived at the motel parking lot, it was business as usual. Loud bikers gathered in the parking lot laying black marks, comparing bikes, getting drunk, just doing what you do at these rallies.  I had a delivery going to the third floor, so I make my way up the ramp all the way to the top of the building.\n\nJust as I'm confirming the room number on the box, I look over the balcony from the third floor and see my little silver '89 CRX squealing donuts in the parking lot below.  OH SHIT.  I throw the pizza bag down by the door and start SPRINTING down the ramp that circles behind the building.\n\nAs I come around the second floor balcony, the parking lot is in view again, and I see this drunk biker standing outside my car with my lit Domino's car topper hoisted up in the air like a giant trophy while the crowd cheers.\n\nBy the time I make it around the building again to the ground floor, the guy had disappeared into the crowd never to be seen again.  Roars of laughter are coming from the crowd at my expense as I put the car topper back on my car, shut and lock the door and go back up top to collect my money, red faced.\n\nI never left my car running during a delivery again.  LOL\n\n\n\n",

Hotel deliveries all day.  $200+ a night in tips, easy.\n\nThe problem is around dinner time, traffic is stalled, people are drunk and hungry, deliveries are running behind...  I'd be walking up to a hotel with a bag of pizzas and people down in the parking lot would LEGIT walk up to me with cash in hand and pretend to be the people who ordered.\n\nSo I started lying to test them.  Dude walks up to me with cash, so I peek in my bag and say, Oh, you're Econolodge room 334?  (there's not even a room 334 lol).  With a straight face, he says, \"Yep, that's me!\" and extends his money to me.  Oh, this one's going to room 201 (the actual room), yours will be here soon.  (Bye Felicia.)\n",

And some small town crackhead ruined it all.\n\n\n\nI've been staring at my desktop for the last few hours just kind of in shock. The last story on the police facebook is about a lost chicken they found. Just, I don't know, just be careful out there.\n\n\n\nEdit Update: He's currently in the CCU, one of the stabs nicked his heart, he's on a ventilator.  That's about all we can find out, since none of us are legally family, and his family hasn't arrived yet they should get there late tonight, so hopefully I can update again. The police say they've \"Got a person of interest\" but it's an active investigation blah blah. The town is going pretty crazy, we're really small, like, 10k~ population.  \n\nUpdate 2: One hole in each lung, on monday they're going to take him off the ventilator and see if he can breathe on his own. They said he opened his eyes for a few seconds, which sounds like something so small, but it's amazing how good it felt to hear. He has 'defensive wounds all over his body' so as best as we can tell, it was not a one sided fight. They have someone in custody, but so far we don't really know anything about what actually happened. He has complete coverage insurance wise, and the owner has promised that he'll be taken care of, 'anything he needs at all', which makes me feel strangely proud.\n\nIt's amazing how it kinda is still business as usual, I mean, we all have the I'm not going to die for 5$ an hour conversation, everyone is angry, but everyone shows up. I know we can't just close shop until he's better, but it just feels weird. I figure going forward any news will be slow, but I'll continue to update the thread as I can.

        "text": "tl;dr if you plan on being a GM don't also plan on being a shitty person because nobody will like you.\n\nSo for the first time in fucking ever I'm working a Friday night shift. I don't know why I don't get them, but it feels really fucking nice. So I come in around 5 my shift. I see 2 others drivers in there, which at first gets me a little sad because that means it's slow but it was just kind of a small gap in our busy speed.\n\n2 orders go, so I'm waiting for my order. It's a huge $120 order (huge being \"i bought a shitton of soda all in bottles for whatever reason and a fuckton of wings) to our furthest delivery area. So I'm waiting, and I see that there's no pizzas in the oven. A likely story, it might just be a wing order or something, since there's a bunch of shit by the wing station.\n\nSo I print out the receipt, and I see... 2 pizzas, a cookie, and a pasta. I look at the make table. Nobody. I look at the dishes. A CSR who was on his first week, that didn't know how to cook. I looked all around the fucking place, and it's literally me and this CSR that I'm now going to refer to as Q*Bert.\n\nSo I ask Q*Bert\n\n\"where the fuck are the manager and the cook\"\n\nQ*Bert is like \"oh uhhhh they went outside like 30 minutes ago to talk\"\n\nI am fuming. Because this order had been sitting on make table for 15 minutes now. I also can't get my bank to start taking orders because my manager clocked out to go talk to this person.\n\nThis isn't the first time some shit like this had happened. There's a lot of times where my manager will just straight up leave with this particular cook to go \"talk\" outside. Usually though there's at least one other manager or cook there when he pulls this shit, so it's moreso just really fucking annoying rather than store-killing.\n\nBut nobody on shift knows how to make anything.\n\nSo here I am in this empty ass store while my boy Q*Bert is doing his damndest with the dishes.\n\nI let out a cry of despair\n\n\"[my general manager's name, with the only vowel in it enlongated]!!!!! WHYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!\"\n\nI decide that rather than screaming at my manager who is out back getting his dick wet by someone who just graduated high school, I'd just make this bullshit myself.\n\nSo I go to the pre-prepped area and grab the first item! A hand tossed pizza! I set my pre-sauced pizza down, aaand...\n\nIt's fucking garlic Parmesan. Every god damn time I have to do this shit, it's always someone wanting garlic parm sauce instead of marinara. Like holy shit why can't you guys just order a cheese pizza when my manager is getting his chicken choked.\n\nSo I decide it's time to take matters into my own hands... (there's a pun somewhere there). I take the hand-tossed dough, and I toss the shit out of it (aka. tug on the edges until it covers the entire pan). It looks like anal. It's not torn but damn does it suck ass.\n\nAt this point I'm contemplating re-trying and wasting dough, because honestly who gives a shit it's not like my manager is there. Luckily at this time, another driver enters the building.\n\nThis man I will call fucking Spiderman, because he literally just swooped in and said \"need help?\"\n\nThis is the same man that saved my ass when I was in a similar situation to this last month (except my manager had an actual reason to not be on the line. Shift manager, not GM).\n\nSo I show spiderman my horrifically tossed hand tossed pizza and he just kinda grabs it and is like \"fuck it whatever\".\n\nSo I'm making this stuffed ass crust pizza, he's destroying this hand tossed pizza, the pasta and cookie go in, we're chillin. In the least gay way possible, I tell him \"thanks\"\n\nto which he replies \"you're welcome\"\n\nAt this point my mind is broken. I'm like a really shitty hentai movie, I'm just dying. Except instead of saying \"oh fuck more\" I'm mostly just saying \"Man fuck you [general manager] why would you do this shit\"\n\nSo time passes and the pizza looks... i never actually saw the pizza since I was taking a fat pizza shit when the other driver was at cut table but we didn't get a complaint so hopefully it was good.\n\nI take this delivery and make a fat $20. I threw in an extra soda for him since we were out of water which he liked, and I got stuck in traffic, which was also nice. \n\nWhile I'm in this traffic, I decide that I need to get some shit done about this. If you don't remember my GM from the last story I posted, he's not someone I can directly complain to. So I decide to hit up HR. I text both of the managers, and they're both driving and are like \"I'll talk to you at work\"\n\nI've already known that my manager and this cook are banging, but I spend the next hour or so texting like 4 different people and this man is going hyperspace mountain on this girl.\n\nWhich is already really weird for a GM to be hitting on a cook but she also just turned 18 and he's almost 30.\n\nApparently someone else recently submitted a complaint to HR over a similar event to this, and they're coming within the next few weeks. The GM responded to this complaint by cutting her hours from 25 a week to 10. Her boyfriend (Spiderman) also got his hours cut (most of which I received, while losing the rest of my shifts.). I also learned about 5 other stories where either the cook came in with very weird (read: this bitch had scratches and hickeys) marks on her, or just otherwise got a free pass on the rules while we got yelled at for not having everything perfect. \n\nOne of these stories include when one of the best drivers at our store got written up for being 20 minutes late, yet the GM and the cook came in 30 minutes late with no issue.\n\nHowever, with this HR visit, our area coach defends this GM with her life, and informed him of the visit in 2 weeks. Call me crazy, but I and the staff firmly believe that there is a plot to get rid of people that are complaining.\n\nMostly because that happened already.\n\nWe had another cook who had been with the company for a few years. She was fantastic, probably would have been a manager if she knew how to be serious, but she was always on top of her shit. She saw this relationship with my GM and the cook from the beginning, and was getting annoyed how much it was affecting the workplace. She was hammered with orders while the cook got to take a break during big rushes and never had to do a large amount of work. \n\nAfter filing a complaint with HR, and compiling a decent amount of similar experiences with other persons, including shift managers, she randomly got \"transferred\" to a different store with no prior warning. Her hours were gone immediately, and we were told nothing.\n\nSo it turns out that when I was talking with the person who had filed this complaint, she had argued with him multiple times over this cook, and the response she usually got was \"do you want to be transferred?\"\n\nSo we're just kind of being really annoyed, but as I'm working cut for my next delivery, I see Spiderman get pulled aside by our GM (not outside of the store. That's only reserved for people he's banging, I think) and they're talking about... I can't really hear because our pizza over is loud. But I can tell they're mad about stuff because I overhear \"if you have a problem...\" from our GM.\n\nSo I go on my delivery, and I get a phone call from some random number. I pick it up, and it turns out to be Spiderman.\n\nToo lazy at this point to type out the conversation but it amounts to being \"hey man ill call you back I'm about to deliver this pizza\"\n\nBut THEN I call him back, and the conversation amounts to something a little more interesting.\n\nSo it turns out he decided to talk to my GM about why his hours got cut. In a slightly dumbass move he decided to ask why he got taken off of the load day shifts, which I am now working. \n\nMy GM says it's because I got back from vacation. Which is true, I did come back... 2 weeks ago, where I never got scheduled to do load days. I figured he just preferred Spiderman's opening (or was too lazy to fix the schedule to put me back on), so his answer was obviously kinda bullshit. So he continues on and mentions that I told him that I prefer working night shifts (which is true but like lmao don't rat a nigga out like that lmao) and that he's still concerned on why his hours got cut.\n\nSo out GM eventually retorts with his famous quote\n\n\"Do you wanna be transferred?\"\n\nWith no real relevance to the conversation.\n\nSo shit is getting decently real as its obvious that our GM doesn't really give a shit about how we feel, and is willing to get rid of people that complain. \n\nSo that's my hell for the rest of the month while I'm here. I'm putting in my two weeks tomorrow (not because of this, just because I'm moving to another state for school) so I won't have to deal with this for much longer, but it's unfortunate to see that people who have dedicated so much time here and obviously have a passion for the team that's been built here are forced to put up with shit like this just because our GM is getting feisty with a barely legal girl.\n\nLike aaaa I thought this job wouldn't have all of this in-drama",

It forces at least a minimal tip.\n\nWe had one of our drivers punched in the face while out on a delivery because the guy \"thought\" he was a driver that's been speeding through the area. Nope wrong guy. He quit so fucking fast that night. Police saw the dude chasing him down the road \"well we didn't see him punch you sooooo nothing we can do :)\" Followed by another of our insiders quitting no clue what happened there they just walked out. I was on a delivery.\n\nI blew my front brake hose recently going 45 miles an hour with a delivery, I make it there using just the ebrake to slow the car down and shifting to lower gears to engine brake.

A 680$ order for about 100 something of our grinders/sandwiches. So about 45 minutes before this order is supposed to get shipped we make all the sandwiches and I pack them up and load them into my car. I forget the exact amount but iirc it was close to 180 sandwiches. It was a delivery to the college baseball field addressed to an opposing baseball team. No problems. I find their team bus with no trouble and I find the bus driver waiting for me. Before I can even ask him how his day is he rudely says \"you can just unload them on the front of the bus and organize them by sandwich type. So I painstakingly do as I'm asked (customer service is a bitch) and I do it with a smile. After I'm done I ask him who I can find to sign the credit slip for me. He says he can do it no problem. I watch his yellow teeth flash as he swipes his pen horizontally across the space labeled \"TIP:\". I get back into my car and proceed to drive my car off a cliff.

But this latest event I'm hoping makes a good story for here. \n\nSo this Pizza Hut has had its fair share of \"interesting\" employees, like a heroin addict, a man too stupid to learn how to fold a box, a man so sad that he quit that he resorted to sitting in the parking lot watching us for hours a day. You know, \"interesting\". Finally one of them rage quit.\n\nSo, Jen, I'll call her, is a thief and a terrible worker all around. On my first day as driver, she told me the straight up wrong way to go and then said \"Oh you shouldn't use your gps!\" This has happened to 5 other drivers. She's stolen deliveries from me and the other drivers. She's stolen tips and tables from the other servers. She's lazy and refuses to do things like prep, or washing dishes. Overall just awful.\n\nSo she rage quit on Saturday. So she was serving with 2 new servers we had and our manager tells her and the other veteran server that they had to cycle in the newbies for the night and of course she went behind our managers back and tried to take everyone's tables. But the other server who has hated her for months decided enough was enough and told our manager what was happening. Our manager goes out there and tells her to cut the bullshit and give the newbies their tables. She responds by walking off in a huff and decided to go on break. Right at that moment, a table of 8 walked it. Oh all of a sudden, she doesn't want to go on break anymore. Manager said NOPE go on break like you said you were, new girl is taking it. Jen clocks out for her break.\n\nExcept she doesn't come back. My manager asks me \"Hey Realm you seen Jen anywhere?\" \"Nope, her car's not outside either.\" \"godDAMMIT\"\n\nManager texts her, no response. So we assumed she just... quit. Because she didn't get her way, I guess. So  the managers filled out the paperwork for employee termination, we covered her shifts and everyone's general attitude is \"ding dong the witch is dead\"\n\nSo Monday we find out she doesn't think she quit. Why, I don't know. She blew up our manager's phone asking for her job back. And today my manager asked ME if we should bring her back. And I'm like \"Listen, people work here for like a week and hate her. She's a thief and not very good at her job.  So I'm going to go with no.\" And so she is officially gone.\n\nHonestly, work has gotten so much better even in just the 4 day time period in which this happened.",

The guy that was helping me called out to the guy I was supposed to deliver to. No answer. Which happens, it's a workplace and they're not on lunch. So I give the pizza to the guy and have him sign off for it, and he said he'll give it to the person who ordered it when he's free (I'm assuming they ordered for a group so they'd go on lunch afterwards.)\n\nHowever what I did not realize after this is that I am clinically retarded and should have made sure that the pizza made it somewhere. . . beCAUSE, while I was on my other delivery, I get a phone call from my manager saying \"CDFReditum hey uhhh they called and said they didn't get their pizza\"\n\nSo me, being the master delivery man that I am, state \"what the fuck lmao\"\n\nTurns out that the kid that picked up the pizza from me legit just stole it. 2 pizzas, wings, and a soda, all just stolen. We're trying to figure it out while I drive back to the store, and my manager just starts making a fully comped re-make, and I think we also gave him store credit since that was genuinely kind of our fuck-up. \n\nWhile my manager was dealing with that, I was trying my best to remember what the kid looked like. He was some tall lanky white guy that would probably get his ass beat relatively easily. But then I realized that this was a credit card order. And he signed for it. . .\n\nYou fucked up, Justin [Last name redacted halfly because this is a subreddit and halfly because I could only read like half the letters]. Manager and I both agreed that we were gonna rat out this Justin dude because it's a waste of our time to re-make a pizza because someone decided to be a piece of shit.\n\nLuckily the guy who ordered was very nice and still tipped me $2 even though we had to send his order our again. He also didn't seem too hell-bent on finding this Justin kid but I hope for my sake that he gets his ass beat for stealing a hard-working co-workers pizza.\n\ntl;dr I hate delivering to places of business. Especially factories or construction areas. It's very rare that I don't have an issue at a place like this, either in \"where the fuck are you guys\" to \"lol no tip even though you came from 7 miles away.\" or my personal favorite of \"I'm going to anticipate that you guys will be 30 minutes late so I'll just order pizza an hour before my shift ends so you have to wait for me because your bitch ass GM is like \"haha yeah no man wait in the lobby\"\"",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/6mbcvq/i_refuse_to_deliver_to_kids_with_parents/",
        "text": "As of today, if you're under the age of \"whatever the fuck I deem to be a fucking child\" and you go to pay for a fucking pizza, I'm going to tell you \"get your parent or whoever placed the order\"\n\nHere's why.\n\nSo to start this off, I was closing CSR on Saturday. I got off work at 11:30, and then I had a pretty serious issue come up on a discord server (aka. Some guy decided to devise a plan to get me banned... which worked, but I had to stay up to figure out like \"what the fuck lmao\") so I go to bed around 3 AM. And I was opening driver, so I got there at 9:30. So I'm not like SLEEPY but I'm not 100% there. This is relevant later.\n\nSo it's an insanely slow day at work. Like, we had no real orders apart from the random 1 every 45 minutes or so until like 2 PM (For reference, I opened.)\n\nSo I deliver a few and it's all good, until I get a single to some super close house. I deliver it as usual, and I see someone looking over the window on the door.\n\n\"WHO IS IT\"\n\nI fucking hate this lmfao I'm carrying two fucking dinner boxes, wearing a pizza hut hat, a pizza hut shirt, and you fucking ordered pizza 20 minutes ago.\n\nBut god damn if I'm not a slut for customer service.\n\n\"It's Pizza Hut!\"\n\nI intentionally crack my voice because I'm a little befuddled that this man is looking at me in the eye (kind of. It's one of those one-way mirrors but I can still see his outline. Plus there's a peephole).\n\nSo he walks away and I'm out there for a minute or two. I figure he's just grabbing his wallet or some shit, or maybe putting a dog in a cage or something.\n\nThe door opens and it's a little girl. I'm not sure if like she was the one that ordered the pizza or the dad is too busy getting head to answer the door but I accept it, and I give her the food.\n\n\"It's $34.47\"\n\nshe hands me $40\n\n\"Great, would you like any change?\"\n\n\"Uhh. . . I don't know\"\n\nI'm having a shitty night, so I'm kind of less willing to just be like \"lmao fuck it\"\n\n\"Okay. Well if you wanna leave a tip, that's up to you, but if not, then I'll give you back the $5\"\n\n\"I wanna leave a tip\"\n\n\"How much?\"\n\n\"$8\"\n\n\"You can't do that, you'd need to give me more money for that\"\n\n\"Keep the change then\"\n\n\"Cool, thank you so much! have a good day!\"\n\nVroom vroom your boy finally has a not shitty tip. Fantastic. I drive back to the store and chill out waiting for the 2nd order of my double to come out (It's slow enough so I'm willing to wait).\n\nAn angry couple comes into the store while I'm talking to the other driver. I'm oblivious to this as I'm not all the way there because I'm dying (read: texting my girlfriend but also dying).\n\nMy manager comes up to me and asks \"who took this order?\" with the address written down. I say that I did, and pull up the ticket, thinking maybe it was a phone call and I forgot something. But there they are, two grown ass parents, in our Pizza Hut location not long after I got back, with angry looks in their faces. I don't look at them because this manager isn't super experienced with the driver systems so I figured she just needed help figuring out how to find the ticket.\n\nThen the magic of customer service begins.\n\n\"ARE YOU THE ONE THAT DELIVERED OUR PIZZA\"\n\n\"Yup!\"\n\nNote that at this point I'm stuck in customer service mode. Nothing phases me. Not just because I'm working as a fucking delivery driver but because I have had very little restful sleep. I'm literally not processing that they're angry, i'm just processing them as customers I have to deal with before my shift ends.\n\n\"YOU STOLE OUR MONEY WHY DIDN'T YOU GIVE US BACK OUR CHANGE YOU JUST LEFT\"\n\n\"Your daughter gave me a tip, I asked her if she wanted to leave a tip (Which i know I fucked up by saying that but I meant it as \"I asked her if she wanted change. Whoops\") and she said yes.\"\n\n\"SHE'S NOT FUCKING STUPID WHY WOULD SHE DO THAT\"\n\n\"I don't know\"\n\n\"GIVE US OUR MONEY BACK\"\n\n\"Can do! Let me just pull it from my box!\"\n\nApparently during this time they were talking about beating my ass and how I'm a horrible employee and something about my stutter and something but I honestly was so tired I didn't hear a damn thing. I go to my box and I search for the shittiest $1 bills I can find. I carefully straighten them out to make sure they're nice and presentable (read: wasting fucking time because I'm literally going from a $5 tip to getting stiffed, also mentally processing if they're going to ask for their 53 cents back) and walk back.\n\nWith a big smile on my face...\n\n\"Here you go! Sorry for the trouble!\"\n\nDead silence. I'm staring at this man for. . . what was about 2 seconds but what felt like 3 seconds.\n\n\"You can leave now\"\n\n\"Allright, thank you sir!\"\n\nWith my customer service grin afoot, I went back to where I was standing before, and hopped back on my phone, waiting for them to leave so I could be like \"here's what fucking happened\" to my manager. Luckily it wasn't the GM so I was fine but still, I wanted them to know so they didn't just assume I was a dick.\n\nApparently during this time I was told\n\n1) I am a horrible employee\n\n2) I need to be fired\n\n3) It is a shame on the pizza hut name if I am still employed after this incident\n\n4) I'm gay\n\n5) I scammed them out of $5\n\n6) I am going to get my ass beat by him\n\nLike idk it's not my fucking fault that you're too scared to answer the fucking door for pizza and make your kid do it. Then you throw a god damn fit over it and DRIVE TO THE STORE to complain about it. If a kid is going to answer the door, fucking tell them \"Make sure you get $5 in change\" or some shit. Or overall, ANSWER YOUR OWN DOOR LIKE A FUCKING ADULT.\n\nI swear to god I'm waiting for a kid to fucking drop something so I can be like \"welp that's your fault goodbye\"\n\nLuckily since my GM wasn't in we were all just like \"what the fuck\" which eventually turned into \"what a fucking dumbass\" and then the drivers all agreed that people who send their kids to answer doors unsupervised are bad people.\n\nSo I'm over it. And if they try to bitch about it, I'll just tell them I was almost physically assaulted over a kid giving me a tip when their parents didn't want them to. I already was going to force the parents to pay because of kids who stiff when it's obvious their parents gave them tip money (I mean like, they have $45 on a $39.50 order and the kid just keeps the $5 and gives me the 2 $20s) but this just seals the deal.\n\nI was going to try to blacklist the place because he threatened to assault me and my manager but I don't want to get my GM involved because honestly he'd take the customers side and I'd get written up.",

Out of nowhere this old dude wearing a singlet and footy shorts jumps out from around the corner and scares the living shit out of me. \n\nTurns out he was the guy that ordered the pizza, so it was all good. He pays for the pizza after I've given it to him and I start to count up his change which was all coins. I just dropped the change in the palm of his hand and I saw he was missing heaps of his fingers. All of his change fell to the floor by his feet, and as I went to pick up the change I noticed he only had 3 toes on his foot, which shocked me a bit.\n\nAfter picking that up, I placed the change in his hand and went to apologise, but I couldn't speak because he looked at me and gave me this creepy smile and then said \"need a hand?\". \n\nI didn't really know what to do, I just turned around and got into my car and after the whole \"what the fuck\" period I just laughed about it. \n\nFuck it was weird though.

He said, \"great I'll be right back.\" And I dealt with the next customer. This was during rush hour.\n\nThe rush ends 40 mins later and I notice the kids hotdog still sitting on the rack. I think nothing of it. My manager then asks me to run into the grocery store next door to grab a case of water bottles to put in the fridge. He hands me the exact $20 bill the kid handed me for the hot dog.\n\nI go and get the case of water and go to the self checkout area. I put in the bill and it spits it back out. Same thing again and again. One of the ladies finally came up to assist me and she looked at it. \"This is fake.\" She said. I denied it and said where I worked and said I'd go see with my boss. Turns out she was right. We had the police come and I realized the kid took the change I gave him for the $20 bill and dipped. I was pretty angry at myself and him. \n\nI had to tell them what he looked like but luckily we got him on camera and it was great. \n\nTL:DR - Make sure $20 bills customers hand you aren't fake.",

And for FIFTEEN deliveries in a row that day, none were below $4. \n\nSo, just some random thoughts, and yeah tips usually seem mostly random, but some days are so leaning one way or the other that it seems like it must be me effecting it somehow, I wanted to see if anyone else felt the same way or experienced this too.

        "text": "So I get called in to close tonight since the closing driver is out sick. A little weird since I worked with him on Monday but whatever. Probably hung over from Fourth of July.\n\nMind you that I haven't had a day off since I came back from Europe. I landed Wednesday, got called in Thursday, worked my scheduled days Friday through Tuesday, and got called in today. Luckily I SHOULD be off tomorrow.\n\nSO,\n\nI'm coming in as closing driver on a Wednesday. Nothing too bad, right? It's pretty nice for the time I'm there, two of my buddies are the other drivers, the girl my manager is banging is cooking, it's great. It's slow, but I'm still getting good tips.\n\nI take my second order. It was supposed to go to my buddy but he forgot to tag in and when he fixed it he was like \"nah man you take it, my AC is broken and it's really hot, I don't wanna be in my car if I don't have to be\"\n\nI took it, wonderful group of people. They asked me how my day was going. I said \"I don't know yet, seems good! This is my first (you gotta make people feel special) delivery of the day, I'm closing!\"\n\n\"Oh nice! Good luck with that man!\"\n\nI wish I could have truly understood how much luck I needed today.\n\n8:30 is the time. It's slow enough that my manager sends the last driver that isn't me home. I'm expecting to get a few deliveries, but nothing amazing. So there's a double on the screen. Pretty easy. 60 minute wait, easy money. \n\nVroom Vroom\n\nIt's about 9:00. Another double. As I'm walking out a third order pops up, so I figure I'll come back, take that guy, and be done.\n\nVroom Vroom\n\nwhy the fuck don't people give me gate codes\n\nVroom Vroom\n\nI'm back.\n\nSomehow in the time it took me to take those deliveries, a total of 8 orders popped into the computer. And not a clean 8 orders either, these were all over the map and wouldn't be something I could take in one go without some shit sitting in my car for hours.\n\nI look at my manager. I look slightly downward because she's very short.\n\nShe looks up at me, with a look of genuine anger in her eyes. Not anger at me, anger at the world. I would learn later that she had just read a text from my GM, with the words\n\n\"lol it happens\"\n\nShe asks me to help out with the front. Me, being the customer maniac that I am, decide to do that and completely ignore the orders that were waiting. Besides, our wait time gave us some leeway on when the pizzas could get there. This turned out to be one of the best decisions I made in the night.\n\nThere is a constant stream of people entering, all wanting various pizza products. I genuinely have no fucking clue why this is happening. There's no parties, no events, no reason to be out in the middle of Smallsville at 10:00 PM. We're next to a... i don't know what to call it but it's essentially like 30 alienware computers and you pay $4 an hour to use the computers and they have like a shitton of games on them. Maybe there's some gaming thing? idk, my girlfriend is the gamer, I mostly just play when I can.\n\nSo I'm taking these peoples orders, hamming it up because I am a fully roasted ham, giving out the pizzas with very little issues, until I get to about the fifth person in line.\n\nIt's an older woman. I look at the screen. Every name is for a guy, but who knows.\n\n\"How do you get to [city that's an hour away]\" she says\n\nI'm awestruck. I've gotten a few people asking for directions before. Usually it was to point people towards the nearest grocery store, or I think one time I told someone how to get to the race track.\n\nSo I give her my best pizza hut customer maniac answer.\n\n\"Yeah it's like an hour away\"\n\nCrisis not averted.\n\n\"Well how do I get there.\"\n\nSome people would have, at this point, said \"I don't know\" or \"It's really far\" or \"Ma'am we have 8 fucking orders and there's South American Sasuke Uchicha standing behind you in line, I don't have time for this shit\"\n\nBut I am a fucking dumbass.\n\n\"Oh, okay, let me look it up for you!\" I say as I pull out my phone. Directions to [city] yadda yadda it's really fucking far. The hallmark of our location though is that it's right by the onramp to a major freeway, This freeway leads to 2 other major freeways almost instantly, so it's fantastic to get pretty much anywhere. So I kinda lead her in the general direction.\n\n\"So how do I get there\"\n\n\"Oh! You just take the Z-69 South!\"\n\nIt's pretty easy to get to. Like, you literally get out of the parking lot, make a right, and follow the sign for about 30 seconds before it says \"Z-69 SOUTH!!!!!!! WOOHOO!!!!!\"\n\nI'm not going to spend a lot of time explaining how this conversation went but imagine it like the video where people are trying to convince this guy to leave his car during a flood and he's just confused and dazed and is doing stupid shit.\n\nThis eventually lead me to walk out of the store with her (aka. My clever plan to get her the fuck out of there), and recite this phrase.\n\n\"OKAY. SO. *fingers pointed with directional customer service passion* YOU GO CHOO CHOO OUT OF THE PARKING LOT *points to the streelight* YOU GO RIGHT HERE. VROOM VROOM. YOU SEE  TWO STREET LIGHTS. BING. BONG. *pointing to the visible street lights as I bing and bong* AND THEN YOU GET ON THE FREEWAY.\"\n\nHer response.\n\n\". . . so I make a left?\"\n\nSomehow I managed to get her on her way. (read: I said \"I wrote everything down, hope you find your way\" and ran back inside). I look at Mexican-American Danny Zuko and tell him\n\n\"Pardon my french, but what the fuck was that shit\"\n\nI think maybe 5 minutes had passed. He just wanted his 8 piece of bone-out wings. Luckily he was chill, and the rest of the customers went fine.\n\nThen I remembered \"wait a second im the closing fucking driver\"\n\nAfter essentially shit-talking out GM for a minute, we figured it was time to rip the band-aid off and deliver some very late pizzas. Luckily enough only 1 pizza ended up being dispatched late since we bumped up our delivery time to 120. \n\nI found out that this would work in the best way. I'd take 3 that were below us, driver back to the store, and take the 4 that were above us, and then come back and take the 1 that was in the gates of hell that we honestly shouldn't deliver to.\n\nSo I take the three first. Nothing noteworthy, except that I hate trailer parks because the only labeling they have is black lettering with no light, but meh.\n\nI get back and get ready to take the other four. Help out a few carryout customers first, good stuff, no crazy wanderers walking around, got a $1 tip, good shit.\n\nThere's a phone call. Generally during these times, my favorite manager would employ a strategy called \"fuck it they can fucking wait we're busy as shit\"\n\nThis is not my favorite manager.\n\nSo I answer the phone. It's someone who sounds like their mouth is filled with the Chinese knock-off version of George Washington's Teeth, talking about how the call center transferred them to us because we had a 120 minute wait. \n\nSo I informed her \"yes that is a a thing\"\n\n\"so can you still deliver the pizza\"\n\nI look at my manager. My manager shakes her head no, knowing what I'm gonna ask.\n\n\"no. We can do carryout though\"\n\n\"Okay tha-\"\n\n\"I need your order\"\n\nThe order proceeds as normal, and I tell her \"if you want your pizza you gotta get here before 11\"\n\n\"Oh I'm already on my way\"\n\nNot having the time to contemplate why she decided to ask for delivery when she's driving straight to our store, I hung up and got the four orders to take around the top part of our delivery area. It's not the CLEANEST run (Imagine the literal Northwest and Northeast corners of our delivery area.) but it's the best I can do.\n\nPeople must be feeling the power of Jesus Christ or something because even as I showed up 20 minutes late, I still got hefty tips. It was fantastic. Plus 3 of the 4 orders were cash, so it consisted of \"Here you go, keep the change, bye\"\n\nThe fourth one was the last one I took.\n\nI pull up to the house and someone's pulling in the driveway. completely unrelated, they're like \"yeah someone else ordered it.\"\n\nA child answers the door. Fuck. The child gets the receipt and single pizza and runs inside. There's a little puppy at the door so I say some weird ass white people shit to him while also making sure he doesn't run away.\n\nThis went on for about 3 minutes as I peek inside and see what's going on. It's going around some more with just kind of normal household chatter until I hear. \n\n\"Wait, you're not going to tip him?!\"\n\n\"What? Why?!\"\n\n\"Dude, you gotta tip him! You always gotta tip the driver\"\n\nThank you un-named resident of the household of order #111. I thank you for your $3 generosity (the lowest tip I got on that quad but whatever)\n\nSo I run back, fucking dying as I'd taken about 7 deliveries in the time that it takes me to do about 4.\n\nBut there's the last order.\n\nI zoom back, mentally preparing for the 30 minute trek round trip there. I whimper, I cry, I sob.\n\n\"Oh yeah I cancelled it lol\"\n\nThat day, this manager became my favorite. \n\nAll I had to do cleaning-wise was mop (aka: wipe the dirty spots because we're both tired as shit and we can do a deep cleaning mop tomorrow), and then I was out only an hour after closing.\n\nI made $102.69",

        "text": "Last night after a long shift of standing around the shop, we cut our late night drivers, leaving only the closing drivers. A couple minutes go by before another employee comes rushing into the store, gets the attention of my manager and myself saying \"You guys have to come see this!\". We think nothing of it and tell her to wait a few minutes as what few orders we had were starting to come out of the oven. She insists that we go outside immediately. \n\nOnce outside, she starts. \"That guy who just left hit your car, and drove off!\".  Sure enough, the back bumper of my car and some fresh new paint from the wheel well to the very back edge of the bumper. We go back inside and call the guy. \"Did you hit someones car on the way out? You side swiped Zim's car!\". Not surprisingly the other driver, who we will name Scunt, continues driving home. This isn't the first time my car has been hit, and normally I just tell the other person it isn't a big deal if it's just a dent or a scrape. But for another driver that I work with to blatantly commit a hit and run, I wasn't feeling very cool about the situation.\n\nScunt denied the entire thing up till we had to have the owner come in and pull the security footage. And there it was, right in front of us, Scunt's car having its way with mine. His response at that point was I had parked to close to him.",

I put in a little over 6 years on the road and while I have a decent job that pays much more than I ever could have made delivering sometimes I miss the road. Anyhow there are two days that stick out as my worst ever. The first one was a string of 9 stiffs in a row on a Saturday opening shift. I took 15 runs that day and walked out with a measly $30(mileage included, $1.35 for singles, $1.85 for doubles or more). The second one was an opening shift where I took 17 runs and walked out with $43 (mileage included at $.90 per run) but had a very low stiff ratio, just a bunch of $1+change tips. \n\nHow about you guys?",

They are very popular for parties. I had to deliver 4 of these \"eliminators\" (8 total big pies) to a park, no big deal. My contact, is not where they said they would be. I've already walked to this spot on the park from my car with about $100 worth of pie, and now I'm late because they are not at the meeting place. The insider that took their order  did not take their phone number so I have no way to reach them. \n\nThis park also happens to be where our local pool is located, I deduced that they were probably at the pool. I had to haul these heavy pizzas all the way from our meeting place to the pool, which was about 100+ yards. I get to the outer gate of the pool and I see people waving at me through the chain link. I walk over and I ask if they ordered. \"Oh yeah, hey don't worry about coming around the front, just throw them over the fence.\"\n\nMy jaw dropped and I just blurted \"Uhh no.\" If I would have thrown them, I would have had to go back to my store and make them all over agin, as were already slammed, so there was no way that was going to happen. \n\nI then had to walk around the building and through the locker room to the pool to set it up for them. We made some small talk, and at the end of the day I got an $11 tip so it was all good. ",
