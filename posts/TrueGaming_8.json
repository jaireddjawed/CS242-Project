        "text": "I'm referring to player power and how it's purposed into the game. In traditional RPGs you have equipment slots and as you play you earn equipment that fills those slots which make you powerful and more able to continue playing as you scale your character. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nIn a roguelike RPG, having different item slots can be especially important because it allows the player to tailor their character's build to the specific challenges and enemies they encounter as they progress through the game. By offering a wide range of effects and abilities, different item slots give the player the opportunity to customize their character in a way that helps them to overcome the unique challenges they face in each playthrough. This can add an additional layer of strategy and decision-making to the gameplay, as the player must consider which items to equip and how best to allocate their resources in order to maximize their chances of success.\n\n\nIn addition to providing a sense of identity and purpose for the player's character, the use of different item slots in a roguelike RPG can also help to give the player a sense of expectations and direction as they progress through the game. By offering a clear set of effects and abilities for each item slot, the game can give the player a sense of what to look for and what role each item will play in their character's overall build. This can help to keep the gameplay focused and engaging, as the player is constantly seeking out new items and strategies to help them overcome the challenges they face.\n\nUnfortunately In most of today's roguelike RPGs there is a heavy focus on relics (passive character adjustments) as the main source of gaining power and not so much about equipment.\n\nI believe having both a strong equipment system and a strong relic system in a roguelike RPG can help to create a more robust and deep gaming experience for players by creating synergy between the two in turn offering a wider range of options for build progression and customization. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?",

        "text": "Basically I am looking for a game similar to Beachhead 2000, but with modern graphics and gameplay features. In this game you solitarily battled waves of enemies  from a permanently fixed position (in a bunker). Each subsequent wave got progressively more difficult and impossible to fend off. I want the graphics to be AAA realistic looking. I don't want the enemies to be orcs or zombies and instead I want them to be military soldier type enemies like in Beachhead 2000 that can either fire missiles at you, throw satchel explosive charges at you and fire riles at you. The military situation and gameplay will be very unrealistic. For example, the enemy has to be in eyesight range before they can be able to hurt you. And the enemy will continuously attack you frontally without support in wave after wave like in WW1. And bullets will also chip away at the health meter of your bunker, just like in Beachhead 2000. And the bodies of fallen enemies will be persistent meaning they'll remain permanently on the battlefield where they fall. And at times they'll even pile up to an extent that eventually the enemy will use this as cover. You can call in air and artillery strikes but this will be very limited. The enemies will not be very bright either. There should also be a multitude of maps to choose from taking place in a variety of settings such as jungle, desert, arctic, beach, and mountain terrains. There should also be a map editor.\n\nIs there any game out there that meets some or all of my criteria in any way (besides Beachhead 2000 and 2002 of course haha)? \n\nFor reference, here is a link to some Beachhead 2000 gameplay:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4XArghkliM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4XArghkliM)\n\nLong backstory:\n\nI feel like I have been waiting all my life to play a game like this. Since my years as a teenager I have been childishly obsessed with turning every game I play into a \"last stand\" type experience. For example, one of my favorite things to do in Starcraft was to create maps where you had to defend a position or bunker from waves and waves of Marines and other Terran units. I even made triggers to give it an \"acracde\" feel too complete with a score counter and everything. I've always wanted to have a mode in Unreal Tournament where I make all 25 bots be on their own team against me so that I can turtle and camp at some position and have a last stand, but alas, sadly one is not able to do this. In Timesplitters 2 though I was able to team up all the bots to fight against me. This was mainly all I ever did with the game. One of my favorite things to do in the original Halo, I think in the Pillars of Autumn mission/level, was to shoot one of the pilots aboard the space ship dead and then trigger the onboard police forces to say \"the master chief has gone insane! kill him\" after which they all begin attacking you. I think after I discovered this, this was all I ever did with Halo. I messed around and tinkered with that part endlessly trying to time how long I could withstand the overwhelming last stand odds. The list goes on and on, you get the idea",

        "text": "It's commonly agreed that video games are a fundamentally new artistic medium. But what is it a medium of? What do video games do that is fundamentally unique to the medium of video games, and video games only? Some argue that video games are a new medium due to interactivity, while others point at the rules and structures, and others still might look at video games as a cohesion between multiple disparate elements (music, story, gameplay, etc.) of individual artistic expression. \n\nFive years ago, academic Ian Bogost published a piece in The Atlantic with the title \"Video Games Are Better Without Stories\", to almost universal disdain. It quickly became a piece of evidence to point out the disconnect between ordinary gamers and the legacy media and academia. Yet, nestled within Bogost's criticisms of video game storytelling and clumsy attempts to link Gone Home to Bioshock is one of the most overlooked and arguably the most convincing definition of video games as an unique medium: the medium of **material interactivity.**\n\nBut what is the medium of material interactivity? Well, it combines ideas from video games as a medium of interaction and video games as a medium of disparate components. At essence, video games are software structures with reciprocity and articulation. They contain three components: data, input, and instructions. Data is the physical data you see through the computer screen, from words to music to objects. Input is how human interaction with said data translates to processed information. Instructions is how processed information gets turned into new data or modifies existing data. Multiple pieces of data form a digital syntagmatic relationship: an object such as a tree is simply a tree in of itself, but might represent a forest when combined with other trees, or might represent the Amazon headquarters when put inside a massive circular piece of glass. \n\nThe artistic nature of video games, therefore, would come from how human-machine interplay would affect that syntagmatic relationship between each individual piece of data, or as Bogost puts it, \" taking the tidy, ordinary world apart and putting it back together again in surprising, ghastly new ways.\" As the only artistic medium unconstrained by time, space, or continuity, video games are the medium best poised to explore the modification, separation, and expansion between disparate syntagmatic relationships. (That's not to say other mediums can't do this too, especially with plays--but the medium of video games offers much more interesting and expanded interpretations of syntagmatic relationships).\n\nAn early proponent of this perspective is \\[domestic\\] by Mary Flanagan, a 2003 interactive experience detailing a young girl's experience coming home to a housefire. With minimal text and relying entirely off assets from the FPS game Unreal Tournament 2003, \\[domestic\\] split and rearranged the syntagmatic relationship of its predecessor, an FPS game, into an unique form that further shifted upon human-machine interaction. Upon release, it became one of the first games taken seriously as art, appearing in some of the most prestigious art museums worldwide including MoMA, Tate Modern, and the Guggenheim. Today, despite receiving almost zero attention from the wider gaming community, \\[domestic\\]'s legacy lives on the form of the genre it inspired: walking simulators.\n\nThis might all seem like an extremely pretentious way of saying human interaction is what makes video games unique. But this isn't particularly the case. Video games, as an artistic form, can be seen as the deconstruction and reconstruction in material structure and the relationships between different material structures. Human interaction is simply the catalyst for this change, and offers a much more natural method of facilitating change than with any other medium. For example, the material of language (at least in English) is words, but a single word by itself is not particularly artistic. The artistry of literature is when an author strings together words in interesting patterns. The artistry of video games might be when a video game narrative takes the words it uses, deconstructs them, and reconstructs them to form an entirely new story altogether.\n\nTo cap off this explanation, here are five modern games that i believe particularly fit this idea of video games as a medium of material interactivity: **Undertale, Nier Automata, Outer Wilds, What Remains of Edith Finch, and Minecraft.**\n\nI plan on eventually making analysis of all of these games and why they exemplify video games as a medium of material interactivity. For now, please let me know of your thoughts on this approach towards video games as art, as well as any other games that you think might fit this idea. Thanks!",

        "text": "Just for context so I dont come across as a Playstation dickrider, Halo is literally what got me into video games as a kid in the 2000s. The 360 is one of my favorite consoles of all time. However, to me, its such a shame how the entire Xbox brand has fallen off a cliff the past decade. Playstation has put out banger after banger exclusives, constantly making new IPs, etc. Meanwhile Xbox has barely managed to keep their few remaining series with goodwill afloat, let alone completely running them into the ground with Halo. Its genuinely depressing as a former fan. And then instead of deciding to turn that around and just start making good games again they pivot into making everything about a subscription service and buying out entire other series that were already massively successful. \n\nI know they have lots of things in the works that we havent seen, this generation is just getting started, but I cant help but be apprehensive. People always talk about “but the value! the value of gamepass is so good! you’re basically getting to play these games for close to free on day one! how is that not good for the consumer?” like… do we not realize that they still need to make up for that cost in other ways? Games are only getting more and more expensive and complicated to make, theyre not just giving out all these games for such insane value to be nice. i worry that the focus on a subscription service will change the core design of their games, and that a decent amount of them will drift towards becoming mediocre live service games focused on drip feeding content piece by piece in order to keep people subscribed. you know, the same exact thing they did to their *ONE* remaining massive IP and the literal mascot of their brand with Halo Infinite. I genuinely worry about how this might effect COD, Fable, Elder Scrolls 6, etc. Im not saying they’re all going to become freemium battlepass games but surely their games will become more accommodating for the streaming model designed to keep people subscribed month to month? Idk call me pessimistic or cynical but i refuse to believe that they are giving people Gamepass with such *insane* value without wanting something in return or it not negatively effecting something somewhere else. It just doesn’t work that way. \n\nMore importantly I dont even know if this is sustainable. Look at the streaming service bubble and how its starting to burst- remember Netflix a decade ago? They had pretty much any and everything you could want to watch from any series, studio, etc. and for a much cheaper price than currently. Now everything is split between 80 different services, the content is getting drier, prices are going up. HBO Max is being transformed and gutted, shows are being cancelled and *deleted off the service* because they want to focus more on reality tv or some shit. Turns out they were operating at a loss this entire time. Its basically gone back to cable in terms of how overly complicated and headache inducing it is (i would say minus the advertising but thats not even fucking true for half of them anymore).",

        "text": "Okay, I just had a good impression of Final fantasy 15 after finishing it. so, I decided to give FF 10 and 12 a shot. now I get why people who played the FF series were impressed by FF 7 remake. That is because the previous series was so bad when it comes to implementing characters' emotions and movements through graphics. It is likely that those games are just too old. so maybe it is not very fair to judge the game by today's standards. Considering that GTA san Andreas and mass effect series also had very bad graphics, movements, voice acting, and facial expressions, I wonder what were the barriers back in the old days (around from 2001 to 2006) in creating good graphics and character movements, and facial expressions?\n\nI do think that well-implemented 2d is way better than poorly implemented 3d games. For example, I find that Stardew Valley is way better implemented when it comes to visuals than FF10 and FF12.\n\nTherefore, I think it was the right direction that square Enix took when they developed FF 15 because I would not like any of the series before FF 15. The characters' implementation of FF15 through graphics are way better and voice acting is far superior to the previous games. (FF7 remake was okay. meaning voice acting was okay, and character interaction was okay. The story was short and had very little meaning (maybe because it is just one-fourth of the original) but the combat was really good.) With this being said, I am looking forward to FF 16 and hopefully they innovate and bring a lot of things that they were able to experiment with successfully from the FF 7 remake and FF15.",

The parts, the BIOS, the different Configs, it was all amazing to me.\n\nAfter the build, I got into gaming pretty heavily despite my parent's wishes. I was playing sports and working my way through school, but my attention was on technology.\n\nI started gaming with Half-Life, the original, and to this day I love it. Nostalgic.\n\nWhen I started playing games, cable modems were new, Steam didn't exist, Valve was its own entity. When it came time to create a Steam account, the ONLY thing required was a CD key, physically printed on the case of the game itself. No personal info, no CC, no address, nothing else was needed.\n\nI kept playing different versions of HL: Opposing Force, Blue Shift, Adrenaline Gamer, CS Source, and eventually HL2. At one point I was the number one ranked Opposing Force and Adrenaline Gamer player. My skill, my ability, all of it added up to a sense of satisfaction and achievement.\n\nI give all this preface, because, today, me in my 30's is severely saddened by the fact that in almost every FPS, we have to deal with some form of cheating/aimbot/wallhack. Overwatch, CoD,  Halo, Battlefield, PUBG, whatever it happens to be. It makes gaming SO MUCH more challenging/frustrating. The fact that it is a wide-spread problem, but so little addressed is infuriating. \n\nThe worst part is the gaming companies pretend to give a shit, but nothing changes. I'd like to think that this post is going to change something, but the industry is so ass-backwards and money hungry that our preferences/dislikes/opinions mean nothing unfortunately. \\*Discalimer\\* The Devs/Programmers care about  what they produce but the publishers force them into shitty scenarios for the sake of $$$.\n\nTLDR: I feel bad for this generation because cheating in video games is RAMPANT compared to what it once was.

        "text": " It's crazy to me that the state of the hobby is the exact opposite of what it was fifteen years ago.\n\nBack then, the budget for games' production had just exploded for AAA titles, so they suddenly became risk averse and lost a lot of the magic of the games that I grew up playing in the nineties, which had smaller budgets but could afford to follow someone's artistic vision into really crazy places.\n\nFor a while though, we lost a lot of that. Even now, I'd say, games still don't really have great secrets. If they're going to put a bunch of effort into some content, they feel obligated to put it in front of your eyes at some point, I guess.\n\nBut while I kept wishing that the magic of SNES and N64 games would come back, people were at least passionate about the games that came out. And when something really killer got released -- like Call of Duty 4 -- everybody lost their minds.\n\nRecently though, I noticed that games finally started coming out that were fulfilling the magic I thought they'd lost. A lot of the indie titles are really great -- Neon White being a phenomenal example; Ion Fury being a personal example of something that I just love.\n\nAnd while everyone loves Doom and Mario games, the titles that have really blown me away by being so much more than I imagined gaming could become any time soon are often thoroughly reviled.\n\nIt honestly boggles my mind that anyone can look at Star Citizen and not be absolutely floored by what they're doing with this game. And Cyberpunk... Good God I could talk endlessly about Cyberpunk. The way you're having a conversation with a doctor, and Judy is standing nearby, not even in your line of sight unless you intentionally look over at her, and the whole time she's fidgeting, looking around the room, and is acted in a completely natural way.\n\nIt's insane. And yet, I think a huge portion of the gamer fandom has more affection for games like The Elder Scrolls, with their admittedly beautiful landscapes, but wooden characters and dialogue, and comparatively snoozy storytelling. Cyberpunk's world feels alive, if what you're looking for is not things to do, but is people.\n\nYou pick up a random book in Skyrim? It's long, and boring. Remarkable that someone took the time to write something so yawn inducing. I picked up a poem today in Cyberpunk, and it was actually good. That's crazy. It means someone finally understands what a human being is, and also knows how to make a videogame. I thought it would never happen.\n\nAnd yet, the amount of complaints people have about this stuff... I just can't fathom it. I can't.\n\nI haven't had the chance to play Callisto Protocol yet, but man, it was insane to me to hear Zero Punctuation ripping on it so hard he was saying that the guy who made it was the lesser of the Dead Space developers, and that it was a terrible game.\n\nBut I look at it, and I just see the amount of love and talent that was poured into this game. The atmosphere is astonishing. It really looks like you're on some space prison colony. The way light plays off objects, and with subsurface scattering makes skin look realistic when it can be shined through is jaw dropping.\n\nSeriously, I feel like I'm losing my mind when I hear people talk about this stuff and calling them bad games and calling the game directors hack frauds.\n\nCyberpunk is a masterpiece. It's a flawed masterpiece, sure. But that game is absolutely nuts. It blows my mind every time I open it up. And the human heart beating at the center of it all is just absurd. The storytelling in Cyberpunk puts pretty much everything to shame. The way you can go into Clouds and have the conversation that the game puts you into in a mission early in the game just floored me. I cried listening to the way the main character receives therapy from a woman who is in a state of consciousness that will cause her to not remember the conversation that they're having. And then there's the pretext of what people are \"supposed\" to be doing in Clouds.\n\nThey could have just made it a seedy and leering institution, and a moment for the player to see something grimy and horrific. Instead, they found humanity in it, and in that scene, looking into the eyes of that woman, filled with computer generated stars, I felt like I was looking into the eyes of a real person. Not the woman in the room in the videogame; but into the eyes of the people who made Cyberpunk.\n\nAnd it was like real people were looking back at me. Through the eyes of a whore who was about to completely lose her cool in a minute when I had to break things off before she did anything sexual so that the story could continue, and she was confused and self conscious in a way that felt so real. \n\nCyberpunk is a deliriously beautiful gateway into a world that is at once luscious and seedy, filled with grime and opulence. It's a world that is dark and messed up, but where people continue on as if nothing is amiss. You'd think it was impossible if it wasn't really so far from the world we inhabit.\n\nAnd Star Citizen is a completely fertile environment for anyone's mind to dream about who has ever imagined flying a ship off into space and having adventures. It's not done yet, but what they have made so far is tremendous. It doesn't take a genius to imagine how much work is involved in making planets with animals and biomes; cave systems to explore; snow and rain, rivers and mountains that are A.I. generated, but curated to create landscapes that seem alive. With ships that break apart realistically, and are diverse and exciting, with arcade-style controls that are tight and smooth, that really capture all the fun you can imagine with flying. And tanks, and speeder bikes, dune buggies and trucks to put in your hull and drop onto distant planets and moons.\n\nPeople accuse them of never finishing the game they promised. But they're working on many games all at once. It's an entire ecosystem, and they know it's a gradual process. They're putting in the time to bring everything together, because they know when you take all of that above, and add awesome aliens, and factions, a realistic economy, cities and habitations, and they put in all the systems you can imagine...\n\nThey'll have the best Star Wars game ever made. And it's well on its way there.\n\nAnd as for the Callisto Protocol? I mean... come on. Have we really gotten so used to technology blowing our minds when it advances to truly new heights that we can really look at it and just go, \"Meh\"? It's a game about a prison colony on distant moon filled with horrific events that, I swear to God, looks just like I would imagine being on that prison colony on a distant moon would look. It's crazy things have come this far, and it's tremendous they had the level of craftsmanship to execute it. Whatever may be the case about Callisto Protocol as a videogame, it looks like the best comic book ever, and I'd love to play it. I mean, horror starved people in the 80's ate up stuff like The Evil Dead, with all its cheesiness. The Callisto Protocol is playing its setting straight. I can imagine some ludonarrative dissonance, and the gameplay not reinforcing the horror of the story, but... My God, it can't be that bad! Shit's incredible!\n\nAll I really came here to say is that the world of my imagination would be less without The Callisto Protocol, and Cyberpunk and Star Citizen. It's been so long since I had games to dream about. The last time was when I was a kid, waiting for Ocarina of Time, and Perfect Dark. It's amazing there are developers working who make me feel the love of games again. And it breaks my heart that the ones that have inspired me the most are the ones that so many people are so disappointed by.\n\nHow do these videogames, that are so incredible, have the same relationship with gamers that I do with my dad? I feel like God is laughing at me. And I look out and I see people rejecting all this mind-expanding art while the world burns. And they don't do enough about the world, and they even stop to take a shit all over all this beauty that repurposes the awfulness of our lives into something that should stop us in our tracks, and make us take in all that horror one more time, but this time in awe. \n\nShit fucking sucks.",

        "text": " It's crazy to me that the state of the hobby is the exact opposite of what it was fifteen years ago.\n\nBack then, the budget for games' production had just exploded for AAA titles, so they suddenly became risk averse and lost a lot of the magic of the games that I grew up playing in the nineties, which had smaller budgets but could afford to follow someone's artistic vision into really crazy places.\n\nFor a while though, we lost a lot of that. Even now, I'd say, games still don't really have great secrets. If they're going to put a bunch of effort into some content, they feel obligated to put it in front of your eyes at some point, I guess.\n\nBut while I kept wishing that the magic of SNES and N64 games would come back, people were at least passionate about the games that came out. And when something really killer got released -- like Call of Duty 4 -- everybody lost their minds.\n\nRecently though, I noticed that games finally started coming out that were fulfilling the magic I thought they'd lost. A lot of the indie titles are really great -- Neon White being a phenomenal example; Ion Fury being a personal example of something that I just love.\n\nAnd while everyone loves Doom and Mario games, the titles that have really blown me away by being so much more than I imagined gaming could become any time soon are often thoroughly reviled.\n\nIt honestly boggles my mind that anyone can look at Star Citizen and not be absolutely floored by what they're doing with this game. And Cyberpunk... Good God I could talk endlessly about Cyberpunk. The way you're having a conversation with a doctor, and Judy is standing nearby, not even in your line of sight unless you intentionally look over at her, and the whole time she's fidgeting, looking around the room, and is acted in a completely natural way.\n\nIt's insane. And yet, I think a huge portion of the gamer fandom has more affection for games like The Elder Scrolls, with their admittedly beautiful landscapes, but wooden characters and dialogue, and comparatively snoozy storytelling. Cyberpunk's world feels alive, if what you're looking for is not things to do, but is people.\n\nYou pick up a random book in Skyrim? It's long, and boring. Remarkable that someone took the time to write something so yawn inducing. I picked up a poem today in Cyberpunk, and it was actually good. That's crazy. It means someone finally understands what a human being is, and also knows how to make a videogame. I thought it would never happen.\n\nAnd yet, the amount of complaints people have about this stuff... I just can't fathom it. I can't.\n\nI haven't had the chance to play Callisto Protocol yet, but man, it was insane to me to hear Zero Punctuation ripping on it so hard he was saying that the guy who made it was the lesser of the Dead Space developers, and that it was a terrible game.\n\nBut I look at it, and I just see the amount of love and talent that was poured into this game.

The point is that you can have fun with it, but you gotta come back to the heart of things eventually or you're going to miss out on the most beautiful thing of all: games can take you somewhere you cannot go without their help.

        "text": "I love a good zombie game. It is my favourite genre when it comes to storytelling. Books, games, movies, whatever. So, of course, I had to play Dying Light 1. The game was not great, but it was good enough for me to play the hell out of it. It was fun.\n\nI had high hopes for Dying Light 2 because, I thought, they would improve Dying Light 1 on what needed to be improved and keep everything that made that game worth playing. Well, apparently not. Story was never the strongest point of Dying Light - forgetable characters, bland motivations, average to poor voice performance, etc. I was hoping that that would change with Dying Light 2 or, at least, be at the same level. Holy fuck I was wrong. The voice performance is what you would expect from a 2000s game. The kids' voices, in particular, makes me want to write an angry e-mail to whoever thought that should be in the game. But pretty much any character has a voice of a NPC. There is no mistake, yes, this is a video game and it is not possible to immerse oneself into the story. Characters' motivations are also pretty fucking stupid and their reactions to other characters' actions are dead awful.\n\nBut Dying Light 1 was good because of the gameplay, right? So why does it feel like a regression? I cannot exactly pinpoint why - it has been a while since I played Dying Light 1 - but the game doesn't feel fun. I swear that the same skills in Dying Light 1 were way more fun. Also, in a game where people have electricity, explosives, medicine, etc, there are no guns? Yeah, Dying Light was very light on guns, but they were still an interesting and fun part of the gameplay. They removed it completely. Why? We can't repair weapons anymore. Why? I don't understand. Cherry on top of the cake, I started playing this game this Christmas. Most zombies have a fucking Santa custome. Can we please make it, at least, optional? Nothing destroys immersion as much as spending my time killing zombies that look like Christmas elves. Come on, what the fuck. Also, in a game with so many dark areas, did they really have to turn off the flashlight (even if it was on) in the cutscenes? \n\nI have yet to finish the game, but I probably won't. A game that had a huge potential to become what Dying Light 1 was (or even better, given that I had assumed that they would improve on top of the first game) somehow misses the mark completely and, if it wasn't for the graphics, it would look like a game released in the 2000s.",

        "author": "BAWguy",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/zyarwu/pentiment_disappointed_me_more_than_any_other/",
        "text": "I don't mean to be overly harsh, but Pentiment was just not nearly as engaging as I expected from the buzz and rave reviews. I will open by admitting that I normally don't play \"visual novels,\" but I do think I came into this game with fair expectations and an open mind. For one, I absolutely loved \"Disco Elysium,\" another game with \"all dialogue choices and no action.\" I also enjoyed \"Yes, Your Grace\" and generally am open to a wide mix of gameplay types, as long as it is engaging. I also have had great fun with \"Ace Attorney Trilogy,\" a game that strikes me as very similar in concept. The fact that Pentiment was receiving not just good reviews, but absolute raves indicated to me that this game wasn't just for visual novel-heads, but was a game great enough to be enjoyed by any open-minded gamer. The game received a 10/10 on IGN; Rock Paper Shotgun's review calls it a top 10 GOTY in the opening graph; overall it holds on 86 on metacritic. But I found that the game not only failed to live up the hype, but was quite a slog to get through. \n\nFor one, the game mechanically is very slow-moving. There is no voice-acting and the entire game is told through text boxes, which wouldn't be a problem except that the text boxes are presented in a style where the words are \"written\" in real-time into the box. This can be \"rushed\" by pressing A, but still, the novelty quickly wears off, and instead it becomes a time-sucker sitting there watching the text boxes self-illustrate some banal dialogue that you just want to skip anyway. This is compounded by problems with the dialogue being indulgent, which I'll discuss shortly. Additionally, there is no \"run\" button, and your character sometimes saunters around a bit slowly. The map is small and not too complicated, but still sometimes tricky to navigate. Sometimes when searching for a particular objective, you find yourself stuck in a loop of slowly walking through the same few settings repeatedly until you can parse out which way to go. \n\nAs mentioned, the dialogue itself is also very indulgent and utterly dry. This is a game that takes itself seriously. Characters have plenty to say, but much of it just isn't that interesting. For a game that is entirely made up of dialogue, I was surprised by how often I had to endure characters summarizing plot to each other. Right after doing something, I'd consistently have to click through multiple text boxes of my character explaining whatever I just did to someone else. Further, through the game's 3 acts the setting never changes, and the characters don't change much either. There will be no physical exploring, and the characters don't give much depth to explore either, at least relative to 3 acts and approximately 12 hours of gameplay. \n\nThe tone of the game is serious, but about halfway through it seems to evolve from sober to semi-tragic. Personally, I resented the ground-shifting beneath me. Without spoiling, it felt unfair to me to have tragic personal details, and depressive emotional responses, just shoehorned onto my character midway through the game. To contrast again with Disco Elysium, this didn't feel like \"ahh, so that's why my character is the way he is,\" but instead like \"oh by the way, aren't you sad your character is sad now?\" I did my best to crank my cynicism down and enjoy the story on its own terms, but frankly it just didn't click for me. \n\nFinally, and maybe worst of all, again without spoiling too much, the mysteries were not that interesting to me. Without spoiling, the game is less interested in having you objectively solve anything, and more interested in making some point about perception, biases, ambiguities, etc. I am a criminal defense lawyer and understand well that in real life things aren't always black and white, but I didn't think this was that well executed. I have more fun Ace Attorney's objectively solvable cases. Disco Elysium was less straightforward with its mysteries, but way more narratively rewarding. \n\nIt didn't feel possible to be \"wrong\" in Pentiment. Early in the game there was a time that I had a lot of evidence on a character I personally thought was less likely to be the culprit. I chose to present that character as the suspect, because even though I internally wasn't convinced, I figured it was better to present the suspect I had a lot of evidence on, rather than the suspect I truly thought was guilty but hardly had any objective evidence on. Later in the game I found myself in a similar situation, and this time chose to finger the character I personally thought was guilty, despite not having much evidence. It was a difficult choice -- I didn't want my verdict to be rejected, but at the same time I just didn't have it in me to finger the other suspect, even though it seemed I had enough to convict them. I swallowed and told myself I'd rather suffer the consequences of having my verdict possibly rejected, than to again convict someone I wasn't sure of. To my surprise, the town was happy to roll with my suspect, never penalizing me for not having investigated that suspect as thoroughly. I didn't get any pushback or even have to compensate any further dialogue checks to get my choice across the finish line. This felt cheap to me and broke immersion.\n\nI'm not sure whom I could recommend Pentiment to. Most of my friends who play games wouldn't like it, including those who love to read. I found myself pondering \"who would enjoy this\" and came up with a profile of someone patient, who likes to read, enjoys a slow burner story that never really goes anywhere bigger or faster with the plot; maybe someone with an interest in mediaeval history, particularly Christianity. Someone who would enjoy simulating a patient conversation with a 15th century priest about the nature of taking confession. The only person who crossed my mind was my best friend's retired schoolteacher devout Christian mother. Here's hoping my next dialogue-heavy game will hit more similarly to Ace Attorney and Disco than Pentiment.",

        "text": "Recently, as a hobby, I was reading a book on game design (The Art of Game Design, by Jesse Schell) and at one point it discussed the \"interest curve\".  The idea is to map the moments of the game that most attract the player's attention, whether due to gameplay, dramatic value or technical excellence.  One suggestion in the book is, in the first stage, generate a peak of entertainment for the player, and then decrease in the second stage and increase again until the climax of the game.\n\nAn example of the idea is the original God of War, where the first stage, on the boat, included everything from the game: puzzles, upgrades, epic fights and everything in between.  Then, with the player \"hooked\", the second phase slowed down and gradually increased the experience throughout the campaign.\n\nThe author goes further and dissects this idea referring to three axes that can be used and combined at this time:\n\n 1- Poetry, when that initial attention is awakened thanks to something sentimental, like the beginning of The Last of Us.\n\n 2- Projection, when it's the actions we perform that generate the initial interest, like the first phase of God of War 2005, which is mainly focused on gameplay.\n\n 3- Inherent interest, when something is shown to hold attention, such as the introduction of Bioshock when Rupture appears before the player for the first time.\n\nThere are different ways to combine these axes, as they are rarely used in isolation.  And the whole concept can take different forms, such as offering all the player's weapons at the beginning and withdrawing them after the introduction (like Castlevania: Symphony of the Night) or even using the presented structure to subvert the player's expectation (Metal Gear Solid 2).\n\nThis all got me thinking and I wanted the opinion of others here: Which game makes the best use of its first level?  It doesn't have to be through the lens of the interest curve, it could be a personal opinion (but it would be nice to tell what fostered this opinion).\n\n Ah, a note: Some games include mandatory tutorials that are definitely not interesting.  In these cases, I think it's worth considering the first phase with \"real\" gameplay, like the ship in Modern Warfare from 2007.",

        "text": "Let's talk about the saggy, flabby, inert mess that was God of War Ragnarok's story, because at risk of sounding like a 'Weight Watchers' advert, somewhere within that mass of minor characters and plot threads was a leaner, meaner story which would have landed, emotionally, as the first game did.\n\nBut isn't myth itself flabby? Doesn't Norse myth contain hundreds of minor characters, plot threads that go everywhere and nowhere, non-sequiturs, repetitions, unresolved endings, etc.? Yes, absolutely.   But GOW Ragnarok does not feel like myth. It feels like a Marvel take on myth. Welcome to sanitised Scandinavia where sex doesn't exist and every character needs an *arc*; every character needs to *grow*. This idea of *growing* characters is a very modern thing and it comes from Hollywood, not from myth. Mythic characters are static and in some ways very simple beings.\n\nAll this applied to God of War 2016, but that was fine because it was a Norse myth flavoured coming of age tale, and it put focused coming of age storytelling front and centre. Ragnarok is a sprawling epic that wants to be many things at once - just like myth - but is too beholden to this idea of 'character growth' to weave any sort of compelling story. This is a shame because taken individually, some of the game's minor characters are compelling; particularly Odin.\n\nBut I wish I should shake the game by its shoulders and yell *\"I don't need every minor character to go on a journey of self-discovery!\"* The game is *obsessed* with this idea to the detriment of all else. The game's main theme (which it feels the need to literally vocalise at least once a minute) is fate and whether we have any control over our lives. \n\nSo yes, development and growth is relevant to this. Fine. So have Atreus and Kratos grow, and use the supporting characters to be just that: they should support Atreus and Kratos' story. I do not need Angrboda, Thor, Mimir, Brok, Thrud, Freya, even the bloody world-serpent, all to go on little journeys of self-discovery where they learn life lessons and *grow* as individuals. This ain't Hollywood, this is ancient Scandinavia.\n\nI am not compelled to continue playing the game into its epilogue but the internet tells me Sindri remains unforgiving. If so: good - finally a bold decision. The game has its moments, but it needs to either be focused and modern or by truly mythic: one or the other.",

        "text": "I played this game on ps4 with 65-inch tv and I did not play the DLC.\n\nBear in mind that this is just a personal opinion and review.\n\nI am going to compare this game to RDR2 because that is my favorite game.\n\nOkay, I almost teared up in the scene where Noctis confessed his feelings at their camp before he entered the Citadel (the scene link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhe\\_UTghOVk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhe_UTghOVk)). The brotherhood and bromance that they had shared... was relatable and when the game showed the scene where they pushed the car again with the background music \"stand by me\" flowing ... it made me think about my life... I do not have such friends that I would sacrifice my life for.. but still, I can relate a little bit because I occasionally feel that way to a very little extent with closer friends. so I can imagine how it would feel when you are a person who shares a similar level of bond with friends to Noctis and his friends. I can also imagine how it would make me feel sad but happy at the same time when I am in a situation where I need to leave my closest friends.\n\nI realized Life is more than just what I desire. It is about building relationships with your true friends or family (probably) as well as making good memories together because life is short. And when the journey in your life is going towards the end, having that kind of friends would be a blessing for the person. It could be unbearable having to let those people go... however, Having people beside you that you don't want to say goodbye to, is priceless... \n\nThis game awoke my desensitized feelings that I have been not able to cope with. That means It has been a long time since I felt this way... Maybe my life has been too grey and dried up... and I am pretty sure there are a decent amount of people who would feel this way out there too. so for those of you who feel that way, I really hope you find something or someone that can give true meaning in your life. something that is good for you in the long term.\n\nI really enjoyed the storytelling of this game. I felt more with this game than other games such as Witcher 3, FF7 remake, Cyberpunk and etc.\n\nOf course there are some parts that  I thought needed more polish and development such as the relationship between Luna Freya and Noctis since when I did not feel as much sadness as the game intended when she died. Luna Fredy needed more character development for sure. And maybe, instead of making Ardyn alone the ultimate enemy, they could make another villain that can be a supporter or his beloved. \n\nHowever, all in all, this has been fun and refreshing. I liked the combat (even though the combat system was not better than FF7 remake) and the best part of this game is the interaction between the characters. It was much more relatable than FF7 remake and I guess I could compare the interactions in this game to the character interactions in RDR2. Red dead redemption has such a great story telling and character interactions so when Arthur passes away, it hits hard and feels real because players feel like he is a living person because of the realistic and detailed character interaction and development. and I would say this is definitely on par with those interactions in RDR2.\n\nWhen it comes to story-telling, it is not as smooth as RDR2, there are some parts that are not well explained, but it did not interrupt the flow of the story. For example, I understood why the ghost kings were charging at Noctis towards the end and it was refreshing and I thought it was well implemented. \n\nOpenworld-wise, the camera idea,,, was okay... I got annoyed whenever Prompto asks to take a picture,,, I had to skip all of them. but I regretted towards the end because it asked Noctis to choose one of the pictures and I only saved the cindy's picture.\n\nI am going to stop here but,\n\nThis is why I love storytelling game because they are inspirational and sparks the fire that you lost a long ago. sometimes I want to get inspired so it moves my core self (?), and want something that can make me feel emotional. I will probably get into reading again since books usually have better storytelling. It's just a little harder for me to read than playing games.\n\nWith this being said, this game turned out to be unexpectedly good. I have heard a decent amount of negative reviews about this game but this game is definitely within my top 5 for the aforementioned reasons.",

        "text": "So I've been listening to a lot of Game of the Year podcasts and reading through a few lists, I like to do this to catch any games I may have missed or hear about games I enjoyed throughout the year.\n\nThis year I mainly played Indie games and lacking a PS5 I have yet to play Horizon 2 and God of War, plus I still haven't got to A Plague's Tale (which I assume is AAA category?).\n\nBut what these games all have in common is they were all highly rated at launch with excellent reviews, they were generally very celebrated by fans and all were nominated for the Game Awards GOTY. However, these games were barely mentioned in Game of the Year discussions, in fact Horizon was roundly mocked and criticised by many of these podcasts which really goes against the general opinion I'd seen throughout the year.\n\nYes I know everyone has an opinion and not everyone is always going to agree (although pretty much everyone has Elden Ring or Vampire Survivors as top 3 games). But I feel I have listened to a big enough pool of opinion to form some observations.\n\nFor context the Game of the Year discussions I've listed to so far:  \n\n\n* Giant Bomb\n* Fire Escape\n* Nextlander \n* Minn Max (not finalised yet)\n* The Besties\n* Rock Paper Scissors (top 24 list, not a podcast)\n* Axe of the Blood Gods\n\nIn all these podcasts the game listed above barely got a mentioned - God of War was probably the only one where there was some positive discussion around the game. Although it was not lauded as highly as I expected with many pointing to pacing issues, a lack of interest in the story, issues with puzzles being solved by side-kicks and the game not doing enough new, while RPS didn't even have it in their top 24!  \nThis really goes against most of what I'd seen previously about the feelings towards this game. \n\nI was shocked that Axe of the Blood Gods which is a dedicated RPG podcast, gave all of 5 seconds to talk about Horizon, which was just to say that it would be on their worst games list!\n\nA Plague's Tale is perhaps not in the same category, but across these podcasts it's not been mentioned at all despite the hype after release. I could almost add Stray (although not AAA) as another game that got a lot of hype and listening to these end of year discussions the game is described as 'an OK game with a cute cat' - yet it won a bunch of awards and was hyped like hell at release and looking at Steam it's one of the most highly rated games.\n\nSo I wonder - were people just really hyped early and after a month or 2 to reflect, the issues started to arise and the games weren't as good as what they were made out to be?\n\nAre the opinions of all these people just not aligned with the general gaming community?  \nAre good-looking AAA games given a lot of undue praise due to their technical brilliance, but when put under a microscope come up short against more innovative, fun and challenging indie/AA games?\n\nAre the games just seen as 'more of the same' so not given as much praise as their previous release?  \nOr is it just a case of everyone has an opinion and these people just don't like a particular game?",

        "text": "In non-interactive media we can say that \"genre\" tends to refer to a set of established styles, formal conventions, typical subject matter, etc. Genre is not always explicitly about narrative, but it often is (I observe that the sidebar on the \"Genre studies\" Wikipedia page lists only literary and dramatic genres \\[1\\]).\n\nFor videogames, the genre situation is more complex because \"genre\" can refer to the above (\"narrative genre\") and, distinctly, to the manner of gameplay (\"gameplay genre\"). Any of these may be combined arbitrarily. E.g., we can have:\n\n* comedy / first-person shooter \\[2\\]\n* scifi-fantasy / JRPG \\[3\\]\n* minimalist / roguelike-platformer \\[4\\]\n* lyrical-experimental / ZZT world \\[5\\]\n\nI think this distinction between types of genre is well-known, and the notion that certain types of genre work better or worse with each other is commonplace enough to be a key mechanic in Game Dev Tycoon \\[6\\]. It seems as though this combinatorial factor, coupled with games' unique potential for interactivity, should have yielded a virtually limitless genre combinations and innovations.\n\nAnd yet, the possibility space seems more restrictive than expected. Indeed, Game Dev Tycoon asserts normative standards for what constitutes \"good\" and \"bad\" narrative and gameplay genre combination as a central mechanic of the game \\[7\\]. As u/OkVariety6275 observes in the thread \\[7\\] which inspired my thinking here:\n\n&gt;\\[...\\] many games more or less focus on combining and recombining the same few gameplay concepts, mostly just changing up the setting and narrative. The gameplay verbs are all very familiar. And when they do throw in some bells and whistles to spice things up, they're auxiliary which means they're at best pleasant breaks from the core gameplay.\n\nSeveral replies to that thread correctly note that there is far more innovation occuring in indie/experimental games than in big-budget/AAA games. Nevertheless, it's easy to observe that a relatively small set of \"standard\" gameplay and narrative genres are much more popular than others, even in the indie space.\n\nThis raises a bunch of interesting historical questions:\n\n* are these the \"best\" or most expressive genres for games? Was it inevitable that the genres we have would have gained dominance?\n* Were the first-person shooter and platformer always going to be popular, or did they benefit from the massive influence of DOOM and Super Mario Bros., respectively?\n* To what extent have/do the constraints of business/capital constrain the innovation of novel genres or combinations thereof?\n\nAlso a bunch of speculative questions, the ones I'm especially interested in hearing this community's take on:\n\n* What new gameplay genres are yet to be created?\n* Are there gameplay genres that would never work?\n* What kind of gameplay genres would a dolphin create, if it could? What about a bacterium, an ant, a Martian?\n\n**Citations**\n\n\\[1\\] [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre\\_studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre_studies)\n\n\\[2\\] [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High\\_on\\_Life\\_(video\\_game)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_on_Life_(video_game))\n\n\\[3\\] [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final\\_Fantasy\\_VII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VII)\n\n\\[4\\] [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downwell\\_(video\\_game)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downwell_(video_game))\n\n\\[5\\] [https://museumofzzt.com/file/play/justice/](https://museumofzzt.com/file/play/justice/)\n\n\\[6\\] [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game\\_Dev\\_Tycoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Dev_Tycoon)\n\n\\[7\\] A full exploration of this norming of genres is out of scope for \\_this\\_ thread, but I think it would be an excellent discussion for this sub!\n\n\\[8\\] [https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/zwlnx2/feels\\_like\\_we\\_dont\\_get\\_enough\\_games\\_today\\_that](https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/zwlnx2/feels_like_we_dont_get_enough_games_today_that)",

        "text": "Want to make a note that these are my own opinions. What feels good to me may not feel good to others and vice versa. Also I’m not saying any of these games have bad combat or gameplay at all, I know some people may prefer a floaty style of gameplay and some games purposely use that type of gameplay and that’s completely fine \n\nCyberpunk, The Witcher 3, Need for speed and Deathloop are games I’ve played recently. All of them have had this issue that persists with me- they all feel so floaty. It feels like I’m flying or hitting enemies with no real power or mass. Like in cyberpunk you could turn most of my weapons into a marshmallow shooter and I probably wouldn’t know the difference. \n\nThe Witcher 3- although I finished it becuase of its amazing story, I didn’t feel compelled to keep playing for the combat. Missing an attack didn’t feel impactful, enemies felt weightless and most of the time I found myself spamming attack and magic with no real feeling of power behind them (kill moves could get pretty sick though). It honestly felt close to a moba game, and that was a nagging problem. \n\nAfter playing gran turismo 7 I couldn’t play another racing game. The feeling of power and the weight made me really feel like I was in that car. It was fucking *awesome* -each vehicle felt so different and I felt like every move really mattered. I couldn’t play Forza Horizon or need for speed, everything just felt *off* like my car didn’t have wheels and I was just flying across the streets. \n\nWhen I played the last of us 2 I fell in love with the combat, the satisfying feeling of a close shotgun shot, just barely landing a headshot and seeing blood spurt while their friends are screaming their name. Sounds twisted while I’m writing this but it does so well of immersing me and making me feel the impact I’m having as a character. \n\nThe Demon Souls remake was one of my favorite games for that heavy feeling I talked about. I remember picking the knight character and running through the castle hearing my characters heavy breathing, loud metallic footsteps in the cramped stairways feeling that presence of mass and it helped convince me that I was there. I remember moments where I was swinging my sword and I missed and I was like “Oh shit I’m fucked” Many games don’t give me that feeling anymore. \n\nI know I’m in the minority, and that some people feel like that heavy gameplay makes games feel more unresponsive or maybe even too challenging- and that’s completely fair. I just wish I could see more games taking that approach and experimenting with it, but I’ll patiently wait for that next game. What are your thoughts?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/zx9vcu/the_problems_mmos_are_facing_and_how_other_genres/",
        "text": "MMOs were my favorite genre ever since I was a kid, I've played a few dozen to endgame at this point and still play them to this day as a very hardcore player of Old School Runescape, Runescape 3, and Final Fantasy 14 (just for context of where my opinions come from) but I feel like no MMO on the market is really good, just my love of the genre elevates them in eyes. \n\nTrying my best to take off my rose-tinted glasses, I don't think MMOs are that much worse than when they're at their prime, in many ways they're actually better because of fewer game-breaking bugs, better network infrastructure, and a better understanding of how to design them, but there's exponentially more live service games they have to compete with now, and MMOs fell behind in comparison. I wanted to share my thoughts about why MMOs have such major issues, how other games managed to resolve it, but why MMOs are having issues. \n\nJust to be clear, I don't think every MMO has these issues or has to follow suit in changing these issues, diversity in the gaming market is always good so different people with different tastes can choose games that suit them, but these are consistent issues I feel I've noticed within MMOs:\n\n**Progression systems** - Progression is the arguably the main drive of MMOs, getting your levels up, being able to craft new items, collecting fashion items, clearing harder bosses. The most popular games with progression systems have a very simple outline for players that care about different aspects. Battle passes for people that care about collecting fashion items, ranking systems for the players that care about developing their skill, levelling systems for the dopamine hit of seeing your numbers go up with a constant progression, etc.\n\nMMOs have an issue with regard to these progression systems because they reach out to so many different niches, their devs have to create so much varied content for the different niches and different progression systems as a result. Now you end up with an issue, your devs are spending time (and money) developing content that only appeals to a subset of a playerbase, do you accept that content is going to come out slower for each niche as a result of the split focus, or do you try to get players from other niches involved with this content using rewards from progression systems so they have more to do? I think most people experienced with MMOs know that the latter is the preferred choice but also know how overwhelming and unpleasant the experience can be. Just as an aside, World of Warcraft played a huge part in popularizing the loot treadmill system where you essentially play with borrowed power each expansion, and in terms of dev time, I feel like this progression system is a huge waste because most of the developed content only has a shelf life of 1 year, then 99% of people stop interacting with it forever and you have to dedicate time later on to rework older, outdated content.\n\n**Single Player in a Multiplayer World?** - It's no secret that many people like to play MMOs as single player RPGs just in a persistent world nowadays because of the feeling of other people being present, occasionally talking to them or playing with them if you want to, the presence of an economy and constant updates, and probably many other reasons I haven't thought about.\n\nPlaying as a group is great for the playerbase because it keeps people engaged in the game through social relationships and just the idea of exploring, discovering, and progressing through the world makes the experience much more fun. However, I think it's extremely idealistic as people will naturally progress at different rates, drop off interest, etc. and more controversially, I 100% believe this design principle is outright harmful to the game's health.\n\nDefinitely on reddit, the overwhelming consensus is that MMOs are multiplayer games and as such, content should be designed to be played in a group. However, in East Asia it's an extremely popular opinion that MMOs should be fully soloable if you're good enough, as reflected in popular media like Sword Art Online, Solo Levelling, and The King's Avatar. I definitely agree with this viewpoint because in my experience with MMOs, the more agency a single player has, the more content the community as a whole can be a part of (because of an easier teaching experience), the higher the skill ceiling can get, and players can truly play at their own pace.\n\nFinal Fantasy 14 is a good case study of a game criticized for socially irresponsible game design by its hardcore playerbase for forcing players with entirely different motivations to play with each other, with boss mechanics that cause a ton of friction between players due to the lack of player agency.\n\nOne approach that games focused on group play took is to just make the content easier so that the friction doesn't occur unless someone is actively looking for trouble.\n\n**Artistic Vision and Design by Committee** - As a persistent world with progression that covers multiple niches, I think MMOs are more susceptible to the issue of developers changing. It's no secret that game communities are notoriously bad at game design, even if they can identify problems, coming up with solutions in a complex system like MMOs with way more interacting, unrelated parts than other genres is a huge challenge. This issue is amplified by the players not necessarily wanting what's best for the game, just what's beneficial for them immediately (e.g. buffs to what I'm playing, make it easier to get this item I don't have, etc.).\n\nOnce enough of the original devs leave the game, their vision and control leave the game too, and they're typically replaced by devs applying from the community with the same flawed concepts the community had.\n\nOther notoriously complex games such as competitive games reach out to their elite playerbase for feedback on changes because they'll have much more knowledge than devs do, and reaching out to enough players will sort out the bias of individual players. However, MMO devs don't seem to do this and often end up designed by committee as they take the community consensus, likely because a lot of the money from sub-based MMOs will come from that majority vote.\n\n**Monetization and Playerbase Distribution** - As a hardcore player, this is going to be my bias, but I hate the sub-based model. It runs into the design by committee issues I mentioned before, but sub-based games end up having microtransactions anyways because subscriptions aren't a winning formula for monetizing live service games. I fully believe F2P with Microtransactions is the better model because every non-P2W games end up P2W anyways because of in-game purchases on an online store or the black market. At least when it's the devs doing it, they get the money to make the game better, and again bias as a hardcore player, the players who spend the most tend to be very hardcore as well, so the devs are more incentivized to cater to the hardcore audience despite always being a small percentage of the MMO playerbase.\n\nJust in general with the games I've played, microtransactions have resulted in more content for everyone, even free players, because they're more profitable. The downsides are the FOMO from seeing what you're missing out as a free player, and if the developers implement more malicious design choices to encourage you to spend money, although to be fair, sub-based games do the same thing and if the genre is big enough, you could just ignore the games that are the most egregious offenders.\n\n**The scope is out of hand, MMOs as social games** - A consistent pattern in the rest of the issues is that the games try to do too many different things and it ends up unsatisfactory. Especially outside of raiding and fashion, it feels like other games handle the hobby aspects like hunting, cooking, crafting, etc. much better because they focus on it more. No doubt a lot of this spread in scope is because in the early days of the internet, people used MMOs as a social hangout space but I feel like this concept is mostly outdated and too many MMOs spend too much effort trying to recapture the cultural movement that World of Warcraft was back in the 2000s.\n\nThis can definitely be a winning formula, but MMOs are notoriously closed ecosystems because people want the games to be balanced and the world's aspects to be connected, however I feel that level of connection between different niches that largely don't care about each other is what's harming the MMOs as a social space. \n\nMy reasoning for this is that there's still games that people use as social hangout spaces like GTA Online, Roblox, and Minecraft, and all these games outsource the development/maintenance of their hobbyist, hangout content to the community. If there's no need for developer intervention in balance and progression systems outside of gameplay loop of PvE and PvP, why not just develop a framework to create custom content and outsource the rest of the minigame-style content to the community like these games have? I legitimately don't think it's that much of an ask because we've seen source code leaks before and custom content developed for MMOs on private servers.\n\nI think that's about all for my thoughts on the matter for now, maybe some other things will pop in mind talking about it more in the comments.

Let's compare GTA: San Andreas and GTA V for example.\n\nIn GTA: SA, when you scroll, you INSTANTLY change your weapon. There is no animation of your character taking it off. However, in GTA V your weapon does not instantly change. There is a slight animation. Or let's compare running and jumping. I feel that... in GTA V jumping and running animations start a bit slower than in SA. \n\nOr, let me talk about Half-Life 2. That game is perfect about this topic in my opinion. You can shoot while running, there are no animations slowing you down while you are interacting with the world, everything is smooth and I love it.\n\nThe worst culprit of this syndrome is Red Dead Redemption 2. There is an animation for EVERYTHING, and it's just... tedious. Why do developers love adding that? Some could say that it adds immersion but in my opinion it just makes the gameplay really boring. You could achieve immersion with envorimental storytelling and sound effects as well.\n\nWhat are some other games that run smooth without slow animations?",

        "text": "Right as gaming took off there were waves of fad-chasing titles in extreme sports, parkour, music &amp; dance, etc.  A lot of these franchises subsequently burned themselves out by over-saturating the market with rapid sequels.  But what gets forgotten is that the reason they could get away with that is because the core gameplay concepts were extremely solid and often well-realized.  Another example, Spiderman was getting a lot of games around this time because of the Sam Raimi movies, but unlike many other licensed games he stuck around because people realized web-slinging around Manhattan was an inherently fun thing to do.  You could throw Thief: The Dark Project in there as well, a game that was slated to be a conventional RPG until the team narrowed their focus into making the most interesting game element really click.  I almost forgot the most famous example, GTA was supposed to be a generic racing game until the devs noted that causing criminal mayhem and getting pursued by the police was way more fun.\n\nNowadays it kind of feels like many games more or less focus on combining and recombining the same few gameplay concepts, mostly just changing up the setting and narrative.  The gameplay verbs are all very familiar.  And when they do throw in some bells and whistles to spice things up, they're auxiliary which means they're at best pleasant breaks from the core gameplay.  They don't get the chance to be the star feature that drives the rest of the game design.  Growing up I adored 1080 Avalanche and Mirror's Edge because they focused on very different gameplay than everything else I was playing (there were other snowboarding and parkour games, I just hadn't played them) and they completely nailed the essence of their respective sports.  Maybe we've over-categorizing games at our own peril.  Too much focus on perfecting narrow genres than pioneering new kinds of gameplay.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/zwhgs1/mmos_have_a_lot_of_issues_preventing_them_from/",
        "text": "MMOs were my favorite genre ever since I was a kid, I've played a few dozen to endgame at this point and still play them to this day as a very hardcore player of Old School Runescape, Runescape 3, and Final Fantasy 14 (just for context of where my opinions come from) but I feel like no MMO on the market is really good, just my love of the genre elevates them in eyes. \n\nTrying my best to take off my rose-tinted glasses, I don't think MMOs are that much worse than when they're at their prime, in many ways they're actually better because of fewer game-breaking bugs, better network infrastructure, and a better understanding of how to design them, but there's exponentially more live service games they have to compete with now, and MMOs fell behind in comparison. I wanted to share my thoughts about why MMOs have such major issues, how other games managed to resolve it, but why MMOs are having issues. \n\nJust to be clear, I don't think every MMO has these issues or has to follow suit in changing these issues, diversity in the gaming market is always good so different people with different tastes can choose games that suit them, but these are consistent issues I feel I've noticed within MMOs:\n\n**Progression systems** - Progression is the arguably the main drive of MMOs, getting your levels up, being able to craft new items, collecting fashion items, clearing harder bosses. The most popular games with progression systems have a very simple outline for players that care about different aspects. Battle passes for people that care about collecting fashion items, ranking systems for the players that care about developing their skill, levelling systems for the dopamine hit of seeing your numbers go up with a constant progression, etc.\n\nMMOs have an issue with regard to these progression systems because they reach out to so many different niches, their devs have to create so much varied content for the different niches and different progression systems as a result. Now you end up with an issue, your devs are spending time (and money) developing content that only appeals to a subset of a playerbase, do you accept that content is going to come out slower for each niche as a result of the split focus, or do you try to get players from other niches involved with this content using rewards from progression systems so they have more to do? I think most people experienced with MMOs know that the latter is the preferred choice but also know how overwhelming and unpleasant the experience can be. Just as an aside, World of Warcraft played a huge part in popularizing the loot treadmill system where you essentially play with borrowed power each expansion, and in terms of dev time, I feel like this progression system is a huge waste because most of the developed content only has a shelf life of 1 year, then 99% of people stop interacting with it forever and you have to dedicate time later on to rework older, outdated content.\n\n**Single Player in a Multiplayer World?** - It's no secret that many people like to play MMOs as single player RPGs just in a persistent world nowadays because of the feeling of other people being present, occasionally talking to them or playing with them if you want to, the presence of an economy and constant updates, and probably many other reasons I haven't thought about.\n\nPlaying as a group is great for the playerbase because it keeps people engaged in the game through social relationships and just the idea of exploring, discovering, and progressing through the world makes the experience much more fun. However, I think it's extremely idealistic as people will naturally progress at different rates, drop off interest, etc. and more controversially, I 100% believe this design principle is outright harmful to the game's health.\n\nDefinitely on reddit, the overwhelming consensus is that MMOs are multiplayer games and as such, content should be designed to be played in a group. However, in East Asia it's an extremely popular opinion that MMOs should be fully soloable if you're good enough, as reflected in popular media like Sword Art Online, Solo Levelling, and The King's Avatar. I definitely agree with this viewpoint because in my experience with MMOs, the more agency a single player has, the more content the community as a whole can be a part of (because of an easier teaching experience), the higher the skill ceiling can get, and players can truly play at their own pace.\n\nFinal Fantasy 14 is a good case study of a game criticized for socially irresponsible game design by its hardcore playerbase for forcing players with entirely different motivations to play with each other, with boss mechanics that cause a ton of friction between players due to the lack of player agency.\n\nOne approach that games focused on group play took is to just make the content easier so that the friction doesn't occur unless someone is actively looking for trouble.\n\n**Artistic Vision and Design by Committee** - As a persistent world with progression that covers multiple niches, I think MMOs are more susceptible to the issue of developers changing. It's no secret that game communities are notoriously bad at game design, even if they can identify problems, coming up with solutions in a complex system like MMOs with way more interacting, unrelated parts than other genres is a huge challenge. This issue is amplified by the players not necessarily wanting what's best for the game, just what's beneficial for them immediately (e.g. buffs to what I'm playing, make it easier to get this item I don't have, etc.).\n\nOnce enough of the original devs leave the game, their vision and control leave the game too, and they're typically replaced by devs applying from the community with the same flawed concepts the community had.\n\nOther notoriously complex games such as competitive games reach out to their elite playerbase for feedback on changes because they'll have much more knowledge than devs do, and reaching out to enough players will sort out the bias of individual players. However, MMO devs don't seem to do this and often end up designed by committee as they take the community consensus, likely because a lot of the money from sub-based MMOs will come from that majority vote.\n\n**Monetization and Playerbase Distribution** - As a hardcore player, this is going to be my bias, but I hate the sub-based model. It runs into the design by committee issues I mentioned before, but sub-based games end up having microtransactions anyways because subscriptions aren't a winning formula for monetizing live service games. I fully believe F2P with Microtransactions is the better model because every non-P2W games end up P2W anyways because of in-game purchases on an online store or the black market. At least when it's the devs doing it, they get the money to make the game better, and again bias as a hardcore player, the players who spend the most tend to be very hardcore as well, so the devs are more incentivized to cater to the hardcore audience despite always being a small percentage of the MMO playerbase.\n\nJust in general with the games I've played, microtransactions have resulted in more content for everyone, even free players, because they're more profitable.

Even though this time I played as Renegade, I couldn't  have stopped myself but kept exhausting all dialogue tree options in  almost every conversation - I was saving and reloading to see what other  options would output (and not only Paragon ones, neutral ones as well).  I thought I was doing this because of my indescribable affection and  sentiment to this series but apparently no...\n\nA  few days ago I finally got my hands on the Telltale Batman series,  currently I am about to start the 3rd episode. And guess what? I keep  exhausting all dialogue options... I am not even that much discouraged  by the fact that here it's even more inconvenient and more  time-consuming as there are only checkpoints and no proper save game on  demand.\n\nI cannot help to resist  the urge to see everything that game designers created, even if that  means breaking gaming and plot continuity through constant saving and  reloading. I just HAVE TO (deliberately didn't use \"MUST\" here) listen  to all alternative dialogues that NPCs could say.\n\nIt  may seem like this gameplay style positively affects one's immersion  and knowledge of the lore, but actually it is not, at least in my case. I  find myself distracted by constant saving-reloading cycles, cannot  fully immerse into the portrayed reality, sometimes I forget which  previous dialogue choices (end the related game events resulting from  them) were my original, main ones and which were just alternatives that I  checked because of my curiosity (read: being an incorrigible  perfectionist, also IRL).Pretty obvious that all this also takes much  more time - one episode of the Telltale Batman is supposed to take 90  mins or so, in my case it's more like x2 (at least; I won't dare to  check the exact number).\n\nSimply - I am not having that much fun when playing like this, feels more like a duty...\n\nAs  far as I remember I didn't have such problem in the past. Ok, I was  definitely playing completionist's style most of the games, but the  \"standard\" one, not the sick \"I-need-to-check-every-possible-branch\"  style.\n\nIs anyone else having the same problem?How do you deal with it, any tips?Is this treatable or am I doomed?\n\nI  know the root cause of my behavior lies deeper (the mentioned  \"perfectionism\"), but since this is the subreddit related to games I  wouldn't mind if you focus more on that part of the general problem.  Also, I don't want to completely get rid of perfectionism, I would just  like to have it in check and express it only where it is really  necessary.\n\nP.S. fun fact - I work  as a test engineer (or, as I like to name it: a bug bounty hunter), so  at least I've put my perfectionism to a good use...",

Aim moves like it already knows where you want it to go. Similary, Titanfall as well.\n\nThen there are games like Halo, Destiny 2, Doom and Battlefield. They feel quite responsive and honestly no complaints. Compared to Call of Duty, controls almost feel 'too honest', like it's unfiltered, raw, unassisted feeling. Maybe CoD has really well adopted aim acceleration and assist? (I play on xbox controller).\n\nAnd then... are some Bethesda games. Skyrim, Fall out 4, Deathloop, Dishonered and etc. The moment I start moving around I sense something is a little off. It's something I don't mind as much because they are single player games. But gotta say it does feel annoying enough to notice. Heck even watching those Starfield gameplays, I can tell it's the same story just by seeing the way the aim is moving.\n\nAnd lastly, Cyberpunk 2077. I actually thought V-Sync was turned on by default when I started. And there is this weird default control acceleration that I can't believe developers actually thought it was good to put in the final product. The whole experience that's going makes you feel like you are playing this game on streaming service.\n\nSo why does this happen in this day and age?\n\nI'm sure developers are smart people and if there is something could've been done they would've???\n\nFrom a layman's point of view, why can't all games be like Call of Duty? Super responsive and slick controls? Or at least no input lags?\n\nI'd be more tolerable if the games are third person, but it's just frustrating trying to play fps games and it controls like dog crap.",

        "text": "Thanks to Epic Games Store, I'm currently looking on a downloading process of one great game: Death Stranding. I could've bought it before, but I don't have a very powerful PC, so I don't know if the game runs on my system or not. From this perspective, this can be quite a subjective, one-sided post, and some may tell me to upgrade PC before \"ranting\"... but I don't think that this is only about me. \n\nOriginally, I wanted to dedicate this post to simply sizes of the games. Death Stranding weights 67 Gb, for example. My favorite Batman: Arkham game is Arkham Origins - not Arkham Knight because of it's weight of 50+ Gb. Recent Assassin's Creed games are big, yes, indeed, but when I was playing AC Odyssey, for example, I've noticed lots of reused assets. Finally, Call of Duty games are weighting 100+ while the original Black Ops is still very enjoyable with it's 24 Gb. **The most of the big-weighting files, however, are ultra-resolution textures which my and not only my PC won't run - and it would've been nice if developers added a function to not to install them, sticking to high or even medium.**  However, this is mostly about a subjective side of the problem.\n\nMore objective side hides in the fact that somebody has to do all the graphical features, details and visual effects which your PC may or may not run. **Hiring these professionals costs a lot of money, technologies become more complex and all of it slows the process of video games creation, leaving no place for risky experiments - and probably, another type of professionals is hired to balance between \"risky\" and \"experiments\".** This was told so many times, but if you simply compare how many really big games in really big franchises were made in 2012 and 2022, you'll understand me. \n\nIndeed, personally, I think that the gaming industry was it it's perfect state in 2011-2013: there has always been something big, yet unique and stylish to buy and play, the graphics was very good and, most importantly, character's faces were very recognizable and pretty detailed. **I'm tired of pretending like I don't want to return to these times: the only thing that is actually necessary for games' quality is 60's FPS, but everything else can be held on the level of seventh generation to reduce game costs and increase production times without crunches.** Game that now requires ten years of development may have five, but most of the games which are developed for five years now may be developed for two and half. Leave groundbreaking graphics to Crysis. \n\nHowever, what if developers and people want graphics that is... well, better than good? Personally, I feel very good about the concept of remaster. Usually, remasters are seen as a way to make people buy one game for the second time on a new generation of consoles - and usually, these remasters have a pretty bad reputation. **However, I think that remasters can be rethought into graphical additions to the existing game, made with money from sales of this project - of course, without a need in a new generation of consoles.** The simplicity of this idea is quite crazy, and something like this may happen, probably, in a perfect world only.\n\nI know that many people won't agree with me. Even if you will, one post won't stop the machine that does everything bigger and brighter. This is a philosophy: make your games less graphically advanced, but produce them faster and with more experiments in them. I would love to know your opinion on all of this... and, of course, merry Christmas and happy holidays!",

Several cuts above your average open-world writing. \n\nI recently replayed GoT and while the main-quest was definitely a more compelling narrative than Valhalla's, I genuinely feel that the side-quests/mysteries/world events in Valhalla are FAR stronger. Even when I was in the first few hours of getting to England, I was already impressed by the little stories being told--they felt like vignettes. Stealing clothes from the nudist colony to help the spurned founder, finding the King of Nothing who ruled over a tiny island after killing his brothers for \"power\"... The women who essentially created and lived in her own tomb in order to be closer to God... These are all fantastic little tales. \n\nI'm also playing with map-markers/compass disabled and only using the raven for quests, and I've been surprised by how well the world is designed for exploration without map-markers. One of the few games in the \"map-marker\" model that I can think of that actually functions with map-markers and the compass disabled.\n\nI legitimately think they may have originally intended this game to break away from the map-marker model and then were told to add it in late in development or something, because everything has a distinct visual cue or landmark.\n\nI have some gripes and issues with the game, of course. The combat still doesn't hold up compared to competitors like GoT, but it's *serviceable* and gives you a surprising amount of options.\n\nI dunno. I don't really get it. To me, Valhalla was a flawed gem, and was largely a big step in the right direction for how Ubisoft designs its open-world games.",

        "author": "coolwali",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/zv4e74/thinking_about_gtavs_endings_and_how_to_improve/",
        "text": "Hello everyone. Recently, I was re-watching GTAV's story on Youtube and was thinking about the endings. One thing I noticed is that many people choose C and C is widely considered the Canon Ending. Which is fair but I wonder why people didn't choose A or B as much. I feel the idea behind them are pretty good but the execution is lacking but almost there to being great.\n\nLet's start with Ending A: Something Sensible: Kill Trevor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe idea behind this ending is actually quite solid. Trevor has been such a loose canon and liability that he's jeopardizing the future of the squad here. Franklin and Micheal are using that as a justification to kill Trevor.\n\nAnd the first 3/4 of GTAV's story does a really good job in showing how there's truth to that. For example,  In the mission \"Three's Company\", he refuses to evacuate Micheal because he hasn't killed enough IAA agents to which Micheal shouts \"I knew you were a liability You Turd!\". In \"Caida Libre\", he kidnaps Patrcia because he felt he wasn't compensated fairly by Madrazo. This results in Micheal getting excited from Los Santos and the plan to rob the Union Depository getting put on hold until after Derailed. Even the whole Merriweather Heist. The whole point of that mission was to show how Trevor wasn't suited to be a leader.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I have 2 issues with the way Ending A itself plays out. The first is that Franklin doesn't have any reason to kill Trevor (I will discuss this more later) and that Trevor was essentially on \"good behaviour\" for the past couple missions. I feel this dilutes the feeling of \"Trevor's going to ruin this\" that is justifying the mission.\n\nI feel it would have been better if during the past couple of missions, Trevor continues to make mistakes. Like, let's say he deviates from the objectives and picks fights with the police or Merriweather or the Triads and isn't doing a good job at keeping a low profile. You can a go a step further and have him lose some of the money along the way (it wouldn't be the first time. See the Merriweather raid). So now, that's something Weston brings up to Franklin/The Player as a possible reason when it's time to make a choice. That if he doesn't kill Trevor, he could bring down more heat and lose the money. So even if the player likes Trevor and hates Weston, they may be tempted by the Money and end up rationalizing it the same way Franklin is doing it now. A rare time when both the player and characters are in synch in GTAV's story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow for Ending B: The Time's Come: Kill Micheal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe intention behind this ending is to make Micheal's story come full circle. He starts the game by betraying his crew in Prologue so he could escape the criminal life and retire with his money and keep his loved ones safe. So the game here ends with Franklin betraying Micheal so he can escape the Criminal Life and retire with his money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut the obvious problem here is that once again, Franklin doesn't have any reason to kill Micheal. And unlike Trevor, Micheal isn't as much of a liability and loss canon that you can rationalize killing him. Plus, the story spends a good amount of time showing how Micheal and Franklin end up caring for each other. An especially poignant moment is in the \"Paleto Score Heist\" where Micheal pushes Franklin into the train first for his safety despite Franklin not having the money on him. Showing how Micheal cares for Franklin here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis would be a hard ending to improve and justify given the story so far. But if I had to make suggestions, I feel the story should have had it where Franklin's life gets significantly harder as a result of Micheal's situation with the FIB and he can't really take it anymore. This is something the game tries to sorta do.  The line Frankin gives afterwards is \"You wake up one day, and your legs... They just give, and you just can't run anymore\" but I feel it's not enough.\n\nLike, imagine if because Franklin is associated with Micheal, there are goons sent to his house just like the mission \"Meltdown\". Or imagine if there were attacks on Tanisha, Tonya, Lamar and Denise. Or that Franklin now needs to keep a low profile and can't enjoy much of the money he earns now because of the situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo in the ending choice, Ending B could be framed by Haines as \"look, you're a smart kid. But I know working with De Santa has made your life much harder. You have to deal with constant attacks on you and your family. If you kill Micheal, We promise they'll stop. We'll even pay you \\[extremely large amount of money\\] if you do it. Plus, consider this. Micheal already betrayed his crew that considered him family once to save his own skin. What makes you think he won't do the same to you?\".\n\nI think this would be sufficient to make ending B feel more enticing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow for the fan favourite: Ending C: The Third Way: Deathwish.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe idea here is solid on paper. The squad put aside their differences and survive an onslaught designed to kill all of them from the combined forces of their enemies. Then, they split off and kill each other's antagonists as to not get the other suspected. Like, everyone knows Franklin has beef with Stretch. If Franklin were to go and ice him, everyone would likely go after him. But since Stretch's crew don't know who Micheal is and Micheal has no connection to Stretch, if Micheal kills them, then Franklin isn't a suspect and Micheal can disappear more easily after doing the deed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy problem here is more the timing here. The way the mission happens makes it appear that the squad could have done this at any time. That they didn't need to wait until the end to do this and it wasn't that much of a stretch to do it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis would be hard to improve as I feel it would involve tweaks to much of GTAV's story before this but if I had to make suggestions:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first would be the premise of the main plot. Currently, GTAV doesn't really have a \"main story progressing events\" and the characters don't really have goals to push towards. They kinda just do whatever the next mission says.\n\nSo the first change would be that from after the mission \"Fame or Shame\", Micheal's goal is to rob the Union Depository.  He tells Trevor and Lester not to go kill Weston and Haines just yet because with the heists they offer them at first, they can save some of the money to use for the eventual Union Depository Heist. This would explain why Trevor wouldn't go and immediately murder Haines or something since they need to play them for the Big One.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe second change would be during the mission itself, the squad use some of the tools and gear they collected along the way like the Juggernaut Suits or Getaway Car or Helicopter. This would better indicate that they are prepared now to stand against the Deathwish.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo yeah, these are my suggestions for improving GTAV's endings. What are y'all thoughts on these?",

You’re generally able to get games on release anyway, but it can be convenient to buy in advance. For me, I definitely trust most of Nintendo and PlayStation’s first party releases to live up to the quality standard I expect and am willing to just pre-order when a release date is announced. Pre-Orders aren’t as easy as buying the games you’re most excited for, it’s more about if you trust that the game will be quality. Obviously you shouldn’t really trust the megacorporations, but with the big Sony and Nintendo games you know they’ll lose more if the game is bad.",

Where the boss battle itself involves stage traversing.\n\n1: Shoot the boss for a while\n\n2: Boss jumps to a platform or becomes invulnerable\n\n3: Reflect projectiles or shoot stuff above for them to come crashing down\n\n4: Repeat  \n\nI am asking this as I realized I have never enjoyed an FPS boss...but I want to be proven wrong. Bosses where the level does not play a mechanical part, just the pure combat and fight between you and the bosses?",

The idea is that this megathread will provide a space for otherwise rule-breaking content, as well as allowing for a slightly more conversational tone rather than every post and comment needing to be an essay.\n\nTop-level comments on this post should aim to follow the rules for submitting threads. However, the following rules are relaxed:\n\n* 3. Specificity, Clarity, and Detail\n* 4. No Advice\n* 5. No List Posts\n* 8. No topics that belong in other subreddits\n* 9. No \\[Retired Topics\\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/wiki/retired/](https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/wiki/retired/))\n* 11. Reviews must follow \\[these guidelines\\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/wiki/rules/#wiki\\_reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/wiki/rules/#wiki_reviews))\n\nSo feel free to talk about what you've been playing lately or ask for suggestions. Feel free to discuss gaming fatigue, FOMO, backlogs, etc, from the retired topics list. Feel free to take your half-baked idea for a post to the subreddit and discuss it here (you can still post it as its own thread later on if you want). Just keep things civil!\n\nAlso, as a reminder, we have a Discord server where you can have much more casual, free-form conversations! [https://discord.gg/truegaming](https://discord.gg/truegaming)",
