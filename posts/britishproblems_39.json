We are in a good phase in our marriage, everything is perfect - romance is great, and we fulfill each others needs.\n\nThere’s just one thing that grates on me. I can’t make a good cup of tea. It’s been a running gag on our family. I swear I never stew the bag or leave it in ‘vicar style’. To me the best tea means the teabag stays in 2-3 minutes with a light stir. Sometimes I am a naughty boy and squeeze the teabag at the end - I find it brings a little bitter taste which to me gives the tea a little kick. \n\nWe use oat milk. I find it’s a different ball game with oat milk, you have to leave the teabag in longer, use more milk to get more flavour. However all in all, I feel like a failure.\n\nDo any husbands here also lack the same capability to make a good cuppa? Got any tips?\n\nIt feels like a kink shame to be honest.",

Specially in terrible driving conditions.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut you have made that choice about what **YOU** think is safe. I actually don't think it's very safe to drive, so I didn't go out in the rain at all, although someone else might considering 50mph (shock horror) to be safe in these conditions.\n\nThe highway code clearly states:\n\n&gt; **Being overtaken**. If a driver is  trying to overtake you, maintain a steady course and speed, slowing down  if necessary to let the vehicle pass. Never obstruct drivers who wish  to pass. Speeding up or driving unpredictably while someone is  overtaking you is dangerous. Drop back to maintain a two-second gap if  someone overtakes and pulls into the gap in front of you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSpending 2 seconds to let someone else overtake is infinetly safer than having someone behind your flashing their light and tail gating you. Then these people would not end up driving dangerously close or flashing lights to get your attention.\n\n\"I decided 40mph is safe and everyone else must just follow behind me slow and steady\" isn't valid, but neither is overtaking on a blind corner, so why not let them overtake safely?",
