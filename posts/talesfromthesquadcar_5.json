        "text": "65: I'm getting flagged down by a security guard, the guard states they a vehicle blocking lane of travel.\n\nI heard one of my buddies, putting the call out, so I head over to help him since he was on his way to a certain sector where they pay for extra security via police units. My buddy wasn't in his area yet and I know our Sgt that runs the program would not be thrilled.\n\nI make the scene and ask my buddy what he has, he looks at me sheepishly, \"I didn't even hear you on the radio, he's a missing person, put out today.\" \n\nShit, I just walked into a report that I will have to complete. Good job unit 05, real good job. I sigh and say, \"Okay, I'll take his driver license and got it from here bud, you can clear.\" He looks at me and grins and say's, \"Serves you right coming over here to help me!\" \n\nI go back to my unit and run the man's D/L and my screen starts chirping and flashing red, he has been missing for 6 hours. I tell dispatch and they advise the family is coming to me to recover him, sweet I think to myself. While I start preparing my supplemental report for this very old gentleman, the security guard that flagged down my buddy asks me for the item number since he \"helped us\".\n\nI give it to the guy and then he looks at me and asks, \"Does the guy have warrants?\"\n\nI'm in shock, we are talking about a man that was born in 1944, even if he had warrants, I highly doubt he will doing anything since he doesn't even know what city he is currently in. I tell the guard, \"No, he has Alzheimer's.\" \n\nGuard, \"Oh okay, I thought he might have warrants since he was casing the area.\" I look at the guard and say, \"Okay, thanks man,\" in my mind I'm thinking how the fuck does this guy have a gun and please don't shoot an unarmed old black man for casing... \n\nThe guard finally leaves after realizing that I wasn't happy about his police work. The family show's up, the old black man was actually a father to a cop on the job. He starts thanking me profusely and say's his dad isn't even allowed to drive and he got lost due to his disease. I tell him no sweat and his father was in good condition and good spirits. \n\nI finish my report and go back to the station to send a cancellation bulletin. My buddy catches up to me in the parking lot as he is going home, I look at him and say, \"The guard asked if our older gentleman had any warrants.\" 65: \"Yeah, he [guard] told me he is in the process of trying to become a cop.\" \n\nI look at him and ask, \"Does he have warrants?\"",

        "text": "Dispatch: Unit 5 and Unit 7, we have a 52F, at 123 residence, house is on fire, FD has been notified.\n\nI text my buddy Tony, looks like we get some down time to watch the fire guys shoot a house with water. Tony sends back, bet you they have too many fire trucks for a dumpster fire. \n\nLast time we both went on a residence fire that ended up being a dumpster fire, kids like lighting mattresses on fire. \n\nI make the scene and notice that this was not a normal fire. My first clue might have been about 6 older males attempting to break a window in the burning house and get into a bedroom. I look over what I have, a house clearly on fire and about 6 fire engines. Shit looks bad, and I find the fire chief on scene and ask what he needs, \"Get the family back, we have an 8 month baby inside and we are trying to locate. \n\nI really hate anything involving children, it's one of the few times where I will go into over drive. My buddy makes the scene and I tell him what we have and we begin getting the family and friends away from the fireman and the residence fire. \n\nI see three firemen come out of the residence and a fireman holding the child, he rips off his mask and begins cpr. I get on my radio frantically.\n\n05: I have an 8 month child, not breathing and no heart beat, I need EMS, get them here on a 3, I repeat an 8 month child not breathing and no heart beat, I need them on the ramp to the highway, I don't have a clear area of access.\n\nDispatch: 10-4 unit, EMS has been advised.\n\nThe chief and I and glance at each other, I tell him that he has too many fire engines on a small road, EMS will not fit on the road. Chief says no problem and dispatches his boy's and cut down a small chain link fence and we have an opening for EMS to go straight onto the interstate via a ramp located next to the house. \n\nI watch the three fireman as they continue CPR, with no rest. \n\nMe: Headquarters, tell EMS to step it up. \n\nDispatch: They have been advised 05.\n\nMe: Mam I'm 10-4, but tell them to really step it up, the child has smoke inhalation and still isn't breathing. \n\nDispatch: 10-4\n\nFast responding EMS makes the scene, a LT and a doctor get out and start helping the firemen. \n\nThe ambulance finally arrives and I watch as the firemen hand over the child and allow EMS to get the child. I get in my unit and we go code 3 to the children's hospital. \n\nThe child survived thanks to those brave firemen, nothing but respect that day from me, those guy's were exhausted from the CPR, I wanted to hug them and thank them, but I had to help clear the way for the ambulance.

I get calls of stranded motorist all the time (I'm not a state trooper, I actually have to respond to other calls for service) and I work a lot of interstate. Normally I take my time and wait for a road side assistance to meet me on the highway with their big ass bill boards to tell people to move over since no person has a brain and does that on there own with a police vehicle with lights on. \n\nI get on the interstate and start driving, and by driving I'm going there as fast as my vehicle can safely handle high speeds in the 100's. I'm going lights and sirens and see all the vehicle's merging out of the left lane and giving me the right of way, except Becky.\n\nI'm going to call this young lady Becky, cause she froze up and started slowing down in the left lane where there is no left shoulder but the middle lane is wide fucking open for Becky to merge, but Becky did not have the mental capacity to move her father's vehicle out of my lane of travel.\n\nI'm thinking shit, shit, shit, move over, I change my siren to everything to signal move out of my way but Becky starts slowing way the fuck down. I don't have time for this shit, so I move over and merge into the middle lane and attempt to over take Becky. I stop for a second and look at her through my driver side window and shake my head back and forth. \n\nI continue to find a lieutenant having road side assistance helping her change a spare tire. She was in a bad spot and road side assistance got her out of there quickly. \n\nI should have written down Becky's license plate and returned later to cite her, but like I said earlier I'm not a state trooper and had to go to my next call for service, coffee, and catching up with a buddy of mine from our academy class as he was doing a detail in my district. \n\nStay safe and please merge safely away from the blue lights.

        "text": "I had just gotten off of field training. So the guy in the seat next to me was no longer there to fix my screw ups; I had to handle my own. As the lowest guy on the shift, I was given the worst beat. For us, that means a constant stream of crashes. But they were easy enough; it was a straight section of freeway with 6 lanes that always had traffic suddenly stop, with speeds rarely going over 40 MPH. When a crash came out, it was almost always a fender bender between two cars.\n\nI was in the office, working on one of the many crashes I'd taken that day, when dispatch went over the air. \"Unit 8, crash with no details, westbound I-20, west of Alamo.\" \n\n\"Unit 8 to Dispatch, go ahead.\"\n\n\"Unit 8, we're getting reports of a crash on westbound I-20, west of Alamo. Looks like a school bus and at least one other vehicle involved. Blocking the slow lane.\"\n\n\"Unit 8 to Dispatch, en route.\"\n\nI was walking to my car when dispatch came back with an update.\n\n\"Unit 8, we're starting medical now. Reports are saying possibly 5 cars involved. The school bus was reportedly fully loaded, with approximately 60 students on board.\"\n\nSo...I guess not a two car fender bender. \"Unit 8 to Dispatch, I copy all.\"\n\nWhile I was en route, dispatch came back again. \"Unit 8, we're reporting multiple lanes blocked now. We've got Springfield, Clinton, and Madison all sending ambulances. Passerbys are reporting victims out of vehicles.\"\n\nI came from the opposite direction of the crash, so I could see it on the other side of the freeway before I got to it. It didn't look good. Two of my beat partners beat me to it. When I showed up, there were 11 ambulances, 4 fire trucks, and my two beat partners. Four crumpled cars were blocking the fast lane and the lane next to that, while a moderately damaged school bus was on the right shoulder. The firefighters were offloading the students to get them into ambulances. My sergeant showed up, along with two media helicopters, and a news van. One of my partners yelled to me as I pulled up on scene, \"Welcome to the Troopers!\"\n\nFirst day off training.\n\nAbout two hours later, the scene was clear, like it had never happened. All injuries were minor. I eventually determined that the bus driver, in the slow lane, failed to notice traffic ahead of him was stopped as he was still doing 40mph. In a panic, he hit the brakes *and* swerved to the left. That caused the massive pile up across nearly every lane as the bus proceeded to total 4 cars. The damage to the bus was a broken windshield and dented bumper. Those things are basically armored cars.\n\nThe bus driver told me he was so scared from the crash that he planned to never drive a bus again. I don't think that was going to be a problem.",

        "text": "There's an empty lot across the street from me, for sale. There was this guy who was supposedly buying it, making payments to the owner. Let's call him Shit Stain. \n\nHe lived up the road, in a 35' camper. Yeah, two adults, two kids in a 35' camper. It was set up in the driveway of a house, with the sewer pipe running into the house's septic tank. Codes Enforcement and Child Protective Services was on the guy's ass about it. He thought he was going to buy the lot across the street from me and hide his camper in the woods. Neighbors and I were NOT happy about this. To make matters worse, he acted like a complete asshole whenever he was over there. Every time he took off out of the driveway with his POS truck with glasspacks, he had to do a hole shot all the way up the road. One night, he was over there tearing the place up, mud bogging through a muddy area, about 20' from the neighbor's house. We'd called the cops on him numerous times.\n\nOne night, during the winter, he shows up about 8PM, drives through the snow bank, onto the lot and starts doing donuts in the snow, making all sorts of racket. My rage meter is pegged. For some reason he stopped and just sat there.\n\nApparently the next door neighbors called the cops. Two State Trooper cars show up. I'm fully prepared for nothing to happen again.\n\nThe Trooper cars are parked right in front of my house, so I can hear the conversation. I hear Shit Stain say \"Well, I know I'm not going to pass the test...\" Oh great, the idiot's fucking hammered. Lady Trooper starts doing a field sobriety test. He fails miserably.\n\nLady Trooper starts asking him how to get ahold of his Baby Mama to come and get the kids.\n\n\"OMG, that asshole has his *kids* in the truck!\"\n\nThe two troopers start asking him questions, while the wait for Baby Momma to show up.\n\nEvery single word that comes out of Shit Stain's mouth is a lie. No, he doesn't *own* the property, no he hasn't been there for four hours, yes, he *was* driving on the road, no that's not just a \"lot truck\" that never leaves the lot.... I'm getting angrier by the second, because they appear to be *buying* his bullshit. LT tells him he's not going to jail, if he wasn't driving on the road... The other Trooper goes to the truck and get Shit Stain's smokes for him. They're laughing and joking with him. \n\nI'm just about ready to go out and set the record straight when Baby Mama shows up. LT goes over to the truck and gets the kids out and runs with them over to Mama's car, laughing . They drive off.\n\nMs. Sunshine Trooper instantly becomes The Ice Queen: \"You're going to jail\". Cuffs him and stuffs him. Off they go.\n\n\"Oh......I get it, they were just keeping things cool until they got the kids the hell out of there.....\" Very impressive, very professional.",

        "text": "In the earliest of hours on Friday, October 7th, a man died. A man died because a system failed him. A man died and I was the last one to talk to him.\n\nI found him in a parking lot on a call I've handled, without issue, countless times before. Suicidal caller on a 911 hangup from a cell phone with no subscriber info, just that it was XXX amount of feet from the cell tower. I checked the area, expecting not to find anything or to find someone who I'd give a ride to the help they desired. \n\nFor some reason I can't explain, I went back and checked a parking lot I'd already driven by. I drove through, looking around for anything out of the ordinary. As I was about to exit the lot, there it was. On my right, in my peripheral, was a man I'll never forget. Seated up against a wall, half tucked behind a garbage can. With a shotgun barrel in his mouth. \n\nA million thoughts came into my head. Run away. That's not really there. He's not doing that. You're seeing shit. FUCK. I marked out on him with my location, situation, and said that I needed everyone there. My shift, my family, they heard that call and it seemed to me like they were there immediately. \n\nFear. I felt it as I stared at this poor soul. Fear gripped me tight like never before. I'm sure he saw it. My flashlight was shaking. But then, it vanished. Training took over. In hindsight, I feel like I was watching everything from outside of my body. \n\nThe first few minutes, he wouldn't talk to me. Just sat there looking at me with a hopeless stare. Finally, words. Horrible words, echoing in the barrel of that shotgun, telling me he just wants the whole world to see this. I try to bond. Nothing. He says \"hoorah\" and I fear that the worst is about to happen. Instead, I'm able to use it as our strongest bond. We're vets. That leads to more. We love dogs. We love guns. We love our country. We don't trust the VA. He hints at their failure in his life. We keep bonding. \n\nAt some point, for an unknown reason, he moves out of my view with no warning. All my confidence is gone. I knew what was about to happen. I kept talking to him, but got nothing. I slowly moved back into this pained man's view. But our dialogue slows. He's cutting his ties and I'm giving it everything I've got because I won't let this man become a statistic. A forgotten hero that's has been failed by his government. \n\nI'll never forget the sound. I swear I hear the trigger being squeezed and boom. I won't describe what I saw, but I knew that this man I called brother, and meant it, was gone. \n\nI turned away as quickly as you can when you don't want to see something. That flashlight was still in my left hand. I threw it, \"FUCK!! NO FUCK!!\" and then I broke down. I cried uncontrollably. Sobbing like I was 6 years old. Sitting on a random median with grass covered in dew.\n I don't know who all was there. My hands covered my face so I couldn't be seen crying. But i was surrounded by family who instantly ran to check on my well being. Words of support and love were given. Hugs. Pats on the back. \n\nI can't begin to explain how I felt. I knew immediately that I'd done everything I could, but this man was a brother in arms that I'd bonded with for what felt like forever. 20-25 minutes is all it was. I put my everything into it, but his mind was made up long before I caught him in my peripheral. \n\nThe VA failed him, private mental health failed him, but I did not. I was a friend, a brother, at the end. Something he told me he didn't have any of. A forgotten warrior that felt like no one cared. \n\nThe reason I am telling my story is because I hope it reaches someone in pain. There's always someone who cares, you just might not have met them yet. But I promise this: I care.  \n\nI hope I reach someone in charge. We are this nations sword. It's shield. You might not agree with our war, but we were sent there. We're not the politicians. We care about our country, and those of us in need just want to be cared about. Secretary Clinton, Mr. Trump, President Obama. They all have big talk about how they'll use us or how they have used us. Well how will you care for us?",

Two of my beat partners went en route while I cleared up the one I was at.\n\nOnce I arrived at the rollover, one of the first Troopers briefed me on what he knew. No injuries, two cars. The rolled car was blocking the fast lane and the other car was on the right shoulder. \n\nI spoke to the driver in the car that rolled over. He said he was cruising along in the slow lane, about to reach an area where traffic always backs up, so he was gradually slowing and checking his mirrors. He saw a car behind him approaching quickly and it wasn't slowing. He thought the other car was going so fast he'd pass him on the right shoulder. Next thing he knew, he got hit and was rolling.\n\nI spoke to the other Trooper while we waited for the car to get righted by the tow trucks. He told me the other guy's story; he was driving in the slow lane, a car cut him off from the left. He swerved to avoid, lost control, and hit the other car, causing it to roll over.\n\n\"Hmm.\" I said. \"He's lying.\" My coworker gave me a suggestion. \"Use a ruse!\" \n\n\"A what?\" \n\n\"A ruse. Tell him there are cameras all over, and if you review the footage and find out he lied, he's going to jail.\"\n\nI thought about it for a second. \"There are actually cameras here...and if he lies to me, he will be going to jail. So I don't need to use a ruse, but I am going to tell him that, since it's the truth.\"\n\nOnce we were off the freeway I contacted the second driver. \"I just need to get a statement from you. I know you already told the other Trooper what happened, but I need to hear it. Before you tell me, I need to let you know that you need to tell the truth. Right now, this is not criminal; it's not illegal to be in a crash. But there are cameras here. And I will review the footage. And if I find out you lied to me, you'll be going to jail for lying to a police officer during an investigation. Now, that said, go ahead and tell me what happened.\"\n\nHe looked down. He thought for a few seconds. And then he came clean. \"Man, I was cruisin, putting something in the glove box, and I looked away for just a second. And when I looked back, I saw that other dude had braked really hard, and he was right in front of me. I tried to swerve to avoid it, but I just hit him.\" \n\nNo arrest that day.\n\n\nThe next day that same beat partner got a call of a three car crash blocking multiple lanes with injuries. I showed up on scene second, and he had a statement from the rear car that didn't make any sense. I called it again, \"She's lying.\" I pointed out to my partner all the debris, oil, tread marks, where we found the cars stopped at, and the damage to all the cars. \"There's no way what she said happened is what actually happened. Use the ruse!\"\n\nWe were back at the office a few hours later when I saw my partner again. \"She came clean man. Totally admitted everything; distracted and plowed into the back of the other car. She said she worked at a repair shop and knew how a lot of 'at fault' stuff worked.\"\n\nEvents like this are why I operate a dash cam in my personal vehicle. People will lie to avoid responsibility.",

        "text": "I am going to preface this story with a warning. This is not a funny story. This story is not meant to be entertaining. This story is as the title says, tragic, but I feel like I need to tell it, if only to help with the healing process.\n\nIt was like any other morning. I was working the midnight shift, and with only an hour before signing off, I was sitting in my favorite spot to run RADAR for the morning commuters. There weren't many cars on the road yet. It was silent, almost serine, inside and outside my patrol car. \n\nThen the tones went off. My radio lit up. I was scanning interagency communications. I heard words I never wanted to hear, \"Officer in need of aide. Shots fired. Officer down.\" \n\nI put the pedal through the floorboard and engaged the emergency equipment. I hit the major interstate towards the majority of the agencies near my beat. Then it got worse.\n\nMy zone's radio channel tone went off. \"Officer in need of aide. Shots Fired. Officer Down. Southwest Zone.\" This meant it wasn't just an officer down. It was an officer down from my agency.\n\nTo be honest, I could not tell you how fast I was going down the interstate. If I were to guess, at least triple digits, but it felt like I was going 60. \n\nBy the time I arrived on the scene, other officers from other agencies and my own had arrived. Suspect was down. Ambulance was about to roll.\n\nI left before the ambulance to shut down an intersection on the route to the hospital. Then I watched as a mile long escort of police cars, both in front and behind the ambulance, went screaming by. The ambulance passed by as well, probably doing about 80 mph. After the procession passed, I joined the end of the line.\n\nThe hospital was only minutes away. Once we arrived, the only thing that went through my head was, \"How did all these officers find a place to park near the Emergency Room\". Then I saw the sight I won't ever be able to forget.\n\nThe ambulance doors opened and they unloaded the officer. He had blood on his face and he was staring blankly up at the sky. A paramedic was straddling him, performing chest compressions. That was the last time I saw him. The word being passed around was he was alive but in critical condition.\n\nOur supervisor arrived and coordinated the arrival of soon-to-be arriving media. I was tasked with holding an inner checkpoint near the entrance to the Emergency Room. As more and more officers from my agency arrived, their mood got worse and worse. All I could see from my post was a lot of red faces and watery eyes combined with a few officers yelling in disbelief. \n\nMy relief arrived sometime later and I drove numb back to the station and then home. I had seen enough for one day. I needed the love of my significant other.\n\nIt wasn't until I woke up that afternoon when I got the news. The officer was dead. Upon hearing that news, I thought I would break down and cry. \n\nBut I have yet to cry. I just keep seeing the image of him being unloaded from the ambulance over and over again.\n\nThe details of the incident were as follows: The officer and an assist car received a call for a disturbance. Ex-boyfriend refusing to leave. Upon arrival, the officer saw the ex sitting in his car. The officer approached and gave commands to see the suspect's hands. The suspect fired at the officer, striking him in the chin. The assist car arrived as the shot went off. The assist officer exited and fired his entire magazine into the driver side of the car, striking the subject several times. The ambulance arrived 10 minutes from the first shot being fired. Based on the angle of the shot, it is believed the officer was dead in seconds, if not sooner. The suspect was transported to a different hospital, where he is expected to survive his wounds. The suspect was only a teenager. The officer left behind a wife and child.\n\nAlways be alert out there. Every call could end up like this. Never be complacent. And realize this: At the end of the day, after all the training and safety and cautiousness, it could still not be enough. If it is your time, it is your time. But do not go quietly. Make the suspect fight for every inch of your life he is trying to take. Always have your partner's back.",

It's got a bazillion buttons to open and close cell doors, hallway doors, moving barriers, turn lights on and off, pan and zoom cameras, kick fans in and last but not least, it's where you're shooting gas or guns from, if things go South. All this while the phone is ringing off the hook and the radio chatters incessantly - usually both at the same time.\n\nAnd for things not to go South, you have to know, at any given moment in time, where your 20 to 90 inmates are. There are movement rules, incompatibles, certain numbers of inmates allowed out of their cells at one time and so on. Think about a small scale, but very very busy airport tower and you're close to getting the picture. With the added bonus that if two or more of your planes don't see eye to eye, they like to start a bloody fight. \n\nBecause it's so stressful and demanding, we take turns working the control post. So I'm in there for 2-3 hours per shift, doing all I said I was doing above, plus dealing with inmates because they have needs, want this or that, and so they come knocking on your window and ask to be let in or out of their cells, to speak to other inmates, to call their lawyer or parole officer, put some mail in the box and the list really never ends.\n\nOn this particular day I have one of the cell blocks moving out to the yard for recreation time, while the others are doing their daily thing - common space time, laundry, phone calls and so on. Of course I'm paying attention to the block moving to the yard, because it's groups of 7-8 inmates I'm letting out and anything can happen during this transition - this is when usually fights break as they can group and assault in less controlled ways. And I have to take care of my fellow officers who are watching the move, so double whammy right there. \n\nAnd as I'm busy opening cell doors and double gates in certain sequences, \"knock-knock!\" goes the window of the adjacent cell block. I'm waving at the inmate without even looking, they know if we're busy they have to wait until we're done what we're doing AND THEN deal with their issue. But no, \"knock-knock!\" goes again. I quickly glance over the shoulder at the camera monitors to see if there's any emergency and sure enough there isn't one, inmate Burns just leans against my bulletproof window, with a grin on his face and his hand raised, ready to knock again. He's up to piss me off, and sure enough, \"knock-knock!\" he goes again. Once... twice... three times... and he keeps going.\n\nIt may not sound like much but it's hard to zone out such kind of nagging, when you're focusing on keeping people alive and out of harm's way. Yet somehow I manage to finish getting the cell block out for rec, and turn my attention to Burns who's still there knocking. \n\n\"Okay Burns, what's so important it couldn't wait?\" I mutter, resisting hard to grab him through the gun port and slam his face against the glass a few times.\n\n\"Oh nothing CO, I was just teasing you, I just want to put this letter in the box then go back to my cell.\" I'm fuming. This is a non emergency by all rules and he bloody knew it. There are two more inmates in the common area, watching the exchange and laughing. Not a good thing, takes away from the control post's authority.\n\n\"Nah you'll have to wait. Now fuck off\", I launch my petty retaliation and he indeed waits another 15 minutes, as I get busy with doing my equipment check in the post. They're still smiling, so I know I wasn't very effective. Gotta think of something else...\n\nSo next day Burns is out in the common with his buddies, very busy waiting for his turn on the phone. And sure enough, as he gets to it, I knock on the window. Burns drops the phone, another inmate gets to it. \"What's up CO?\"\n\n\"Oh nothing. I wanted to know how you're doing\", I say and then close the gun port on him. He stands there puzzled, trying to smile while the others are laughing at him. \"Got you good, Eddie\", they go. \n\nFor a few days I randomly knock on the window to get his attention, whenever I'm in the control post and I can see he's trying to take it in stride but it's getting harder. He walks far from my window whenever he needs to get by, generally avoiding me, and it doesn't go unnoticed. \n\nThen one week I'm working midnights, and as I'm doing my regular patrol another idea creeps in my head... it's 10PM, just past the lock up time, and as I go by Burns' cell... \"knock-knock!\" I go on his window. He perks up. \n\n\"Hi Burns! Just making sure you're alive in there. You know, rules...\"\n\n\"Oh come on CO!... really!\"\n\n\"Yup!\" I go, and keep walking. \n\nThen, for the remainder of the week, it's \"knock-knock!\" on his window at random times through the night. It's technically our right as night patrol to make sure the inmates are alive, and if we have to wake them up to make sure, then so be it. And he knows it.\n\nOn the last day of my midnight row, Burns is up, trying to read. 1AM... 2AM... 3AM... I am not knocking anymore, but he's still up and I can see he's trying hard to keep awake. By 5 in the morning his head is bobbing and he really has a hard time keeping his eyes open. I stop by the window. \n\n\"S'up? Can't sleep?\"\n\n\"Oh I'd like to CO. But you're so annoying with all that knocking. Figured I might stay up until you're gone. You know, if I wake up I can't go back to sleep until morning.\"\n\n\"You don't say,\" I'm looking him in the eye\n\n\"Oh. Oh!... No more games, CO. I promise. I promise! Can I sleep now?\"\n\nI have to stop doing this to him. I have a feeling that if I keep at it, Burns will develop a nervous twitch every time he hears a knock on a window.\n\n\n \n\n",

        "text": "It had been a long day. My team was three for three on tracking down wanted fugitives and after several trips to lockup, all of us were at the point in the evening where our cars smelled like locker rooms and the prospect of laying down on a real bed seemed as fanciful as a server not asking how your meal is mid chew.\n\n“Anyone else got anything?” I asked the motley crew once our two missing members returned from the bowels of the county jail.\n\n“Not here.” AJ said, wearily stroking his too long beard.\n\n“We got two of mine, I’m done for the month!” Martin barked.\n\n“Still haven’t heard back from my source on the Li case.” Greg was checking his Apple watch again, showing off his newest gadget and clearly hoping we’d be impressed.\n\nLt was lost in his phone somewhere and didn’t even realize we were having a powwow.\n\n“Ok then. I guess we’ll call it a night!” I began the process of peeling off my vest and stretched my back before loading up for the trip home. The driver’s seat welcomed me back in a spot-on impersonation of a Lazy Boy. It felt like I was living in my cruiser these days but I couldn’t argue with the overtime. Every day was bringing more warrants for more and more serious crimes. My team was just getting off the ground and it was good to be having an immediate impact on the community while carving out a needed role in the department.\n\nI pulled out of the dark Elks Lodge parking lot where we had ended our day and started my journey home. As usual, the team began to chatter on the side band radio channel we were assigned.\n\n“Still nothing from my source.” Greg said.\n\n“Did you check your wrist piece for that? I hope that thing gives you hand cancer.” Martin jabbed.\n\n“Don’t hate just because you barely know how to turn on a computer. This is the new big thing, just watch.” Greg was incensed.\n\n“I’m sure. Almost as sure as I am I’ll beat EMR in tomorrow’s fat boy challenge.” Now Martin had put his cross hairs on me.\n\n“Oh, really? You do realize I was a competitive eater in a former life, right?”\n\n“Yeah, but you realize I took down the ‘Land, Sea, and Air’ off the McDonald’s secret menu without breaking a sweat, right?”\n\nI just pressed my mic and scoffed in rebuttal. I wouldn’t be intimidated by such a lackluster performance.\n\nMore insults were slung over the next few minutes but it wasn’t until Greg piped up again that things had any weight.\n\n“You guys want more OT?” He asked.\n\n“Contact with the source?” I assumed\n\n“Yeah. Li is there right now, at her house.”\n\n“Who’s the source, by the way?” I asked.\n\n“His mom.”\n\nDamn, that was cold.\n\n“She’s tired of him getting high and stealing her stuff for his next fix. I think I just got lucky and approached her when she was at her breaking point.”\n\n“Let’s go make it four for four then!” Martin chimed in.\n\n“North Precinct parking lot?” Lt asked.\n\n“Be there in twenty.” Greg replied.\n\nI called my wife and asked her to put my already cold dinner in the fridge.\n\nAt North Precinct, I met up with the guys again. Greg was shuffling papers, preparing to brief up his case.\n\n“This is Harold Li. EMR and Lt might remember him from that round-up we did a year ago. We had to breach the door and even then he hid in his room until we dragged him out from under the bed.” He passed the photo around from Harold’s last arrest. “He’s a junkie, currently on a multiple-bag-per-day heroin binge. He won’t want to go to jail but mom has other plans. She said he just showed up and she’ll let us in once we get there.”\n\n“He pay rent? On the lease?” AJ asked.\n\n“Nope. Crashes at mom’s house randomly, two or three times a week. I’ve been on his tail for a month now, and this is the first time I’ve had a clue where he is.”\n\n“Well, let’s get going before donkey-dick up and leaves again.” Martin concluded.\n\nWe suited up and made the short drive to Harold’s neighborhood – a trim community of townhomes in a quieter part of town. We blacked out our cars’ headlights a quarter mile out and parked two hundred yards from our target. We stacked up and flowed to the front door.\n\nHarold’s mom was waiting for us. “He upstair! No good. He taking my caah.”\n\nGreg shushed her a bit and asked some pertinent questions. \n\n“Anyone with him? Have you ever seen him with a gun? Does he have any idea we were coming?”\n\nAfter receiving negative responses to all three, we quietly entered and made our way to the stairwell leading to the bedrooms. Harold’s mom waited nervously in the foyer.\n\nWe stacked up again, Greg in front, me in the number two spot, then AJ, Martin and Lt bringing up the rear. Greg trained his gun up the stairwell and turned to cover the overhang halfway to the first landing, Harold’s room was the first on the left once we made it upstairs. His door was cracked and a soft wedge of light spilled into the hallway.\n\n“Three in to start, Marty hold long, just in case.” Greg whispered.\nWe nodded in agreement with the plan then approached the door. Greg waited a beat then quickly and quietly opened the door. He flowed right, I took left, AJ split the difference and all of us scanned the room with guns drawn: no Harold.\n\nThe bathroom door was closed and now that we were inside, we could hear the shower running. Greg nodded in the direction and AJ and I stacked up again. We weren’t going to wait around for a leisurely shower to wrap up.\n\nI tucked my gun to my chest and reached with my left hand to grab the doorknob. I turned it slowly, then swung it open and entered.\n\nHarold was standing in front of the sink in plaid boxer shorts.\n\n“Hands! HANDS! Show me your hands!” I ordered, keeping distance but training my gun on him.\n\nHarold’s eyes grew wide in disbelief. His right hand let go of the phone charger he had wrapped around his left arm. He swallowed hard but not hard enough to drop the syringe in his mouth, full of a brown liquid.\n\n“Spit it out, in the sink.” I told him. AJ holstered up behind me and transitioned to his Taser while slipping into the cramped room behind me. Harold did as he was told. Still training his Taser on Harold’s back, AJ used his unburdened hand to unbuckle his cuffs.\n\n“You may need to, uh, glove up…” I told him.\n\nHarold had puss-seeping sores over all of his body. Pink tinged rivulets trickled into a stream of nastiness that his boxer-shorts greedily soaked up in its waistband.\n\n“Yeah, think you’re right.” AJ said.\n\n“What’s this for?” Harold asked in a bored tone.\n\n“Take a guess genius.” Greg answered from the room behind us.\n\n“Drugs?”\n\n“It’s like you’re psychic!”\n\nAJ gingerly took hold of Harold’s wrist after he got on his latex gloves. He grimaced a bit after securing the cuffs when his glove stuck to a gelatinous mass of goo on Harold’s forearm. “Greg! He’s all yours!”\n\n“Yeah, thanks… we need to throw some clothes on you dude.” \n\nGreg scanned around the room. I chuckled a bit once I realized he was partaking in another of our favorite past times: dress the inmate. His choice of bright orange basketball shorts, fuzzy blue slippers, and stained white polo were met with a sneer from Harold. We dressed him anyway, then guided him out to our cars. Harold’s mom shook her finger at him in the foyer but then gave him a hug.\n\n“No more bull-chit!” She said. “Clean up, be a good boy!”\n\n“Ok momma.” Harold said.\n\nGreg prepped his car by wrapping his passenger seat in trash bags. “You’re not pussing on my car, dude.”\n\nHarold sat down in a huff. Greg accepted the packaged syringe from AJ, secured in a sharps container with the brown liquid still inside.\n\n“It’s a two-fer! Warrant and a fresh charge!” Martin was loud in the otherwise quiet street.\n\n“Whatever. You don’t know what it’s like. I’m going to be sick in an hour.”\n\n“Don’t know? Don’t know?!? Son, have you ever eaten a Big Mac with a Filet-o-fish and McChicken squeezed between the burger patties? I think I have a pretty good idea of what you’re about to go through.” Harold stared at Martin in disturbed confusion.\n\n“That’s what I’m talking about, EMR. That’s proper reverence for my skills.” Martin crossed his arms in triumph.\n\n“Whatever Marty. I’ll give you your ‘reverence’ after you apologize tomorrow for doubting me.” I wandered back to my car, Lt falling in with me on the way.\n\n“My money’s on you tomorrow, by the way. You’re going to crush him.” He said.\n\nAnd I did.",

        "text": "A couple of weeks ago I was sent to the second campus at the university I work at. Now I'm normally posted to the big \"main\" site but every now and then I get sent to the smaller second site due to lack of staffing as we have to keep a certain staffing level. I don't mind it sometimes, it's a lot quieter there, more relaxed, as the students there have been in university long enough they behave, unlike first year students. This story is about the dumbest things I heard over the radio during one incident that made me loose much faith in humanity.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*********\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt's late in the morning, I'm out doing parking tickets with the only other person at this site, when we hear over the radio there's a call for a fire alarm at one of the residences on the main campus.  We think nothing of it, it's not our site, so we continue on with what we're doing but still half listening to the radio. Seems pretty standard, except finding out we no longer have working keys as they decided to change all the locks in that building, without telling us and without providing us with the new key so we could, I don't know, grant access to the fire department in the event of an alarm. Even the fire technician didn't have it, luckily this was during the day with someone around who actually had a key to let them all in. Then when they're finishing up and relaying the cause, this is what I hear:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;Coworker1: the cause of the alarm was the caretaker, washing the smoke head, with a garden hose....\n\n&gt;Coworker2: ...thats... right up there with the water in the paper shredder.....\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI did a double take as I was only half listening to my radio as I was in the middle of writing a ticket, so I quickly sent a text to both coworkers to confirm what I had heard. Apparently, the caretaker thought that because the smoke head was so covered in dust, it would be easier - and a good idea - to simply take the garden hose to wash it off, not realizing that this is a fairly sensitive piece of equipment - not to mention water + electricity = bad - that MIGHT think the water being sprayed on it is a sprinkler head activated and trip the alarm.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAs for the paper shredder, turns out there was an old supervisor years ago who thought pouring water in to the paper shredder to loosen up the paper was a good idea. The shredder didn't last much longer.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe things some people do that they think is a good idea astounds me still. My head hit the desk a few times that day.",

        "text": "So last night while working an overnight shift at a local university, I ended up with a call that turned in to one of those stories. I'm sure everyone knows what I mean, the ones that get referred to as ones for the books, usually because it's that ridiculous and nobody can believe it happened. This is my one for the books story. It's a bit of a lengthy one with some backstory so please bear with me.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt's just after midnight, the university I work at has two main campuses, both of them are mostly quiet - the bar at the one I'm at is going full swing but they seem to be handing things just fine, and I'm taking my turn on the desk. I don't mind the desk, it's a chance to sit and relax, and on overnights it's particularly quiet and rules get relaxed a little. Everyone has to take a turn manning the desk each shift, and it's set up this way to give everyone a chance to relax, in theory. Doesn't always work that way, but I digress.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHere's an idea of what I'm working with. The desk I'm at has multiple monitors and computers; one for doing all my reports on, one that runs the phone call queue software for our general line, one that monitors alarms and is attached to a large machine that sounds periodically as it receives test signals from various accounts on campus - the computer takes the info from the machine and displays it in an easy to read format - and across the room is a bank of monitors displaying several cameras from all over the campus. I have 3 radios, one for each campus' caretaking/engineering/trades staff, and one for us security guards from both sites. We have our own dedicated channel as the other two have high traffic use and we need to be able to communicate efficiently in the event of an emergency. I have three phones - one \"emergency\" phone that's a direct line from panic phones and stations and has a dedicated \"emergency\" number, one attached to the queue system that's for general inquiries kind of thing, and a dedicated outside line that's separate entirely from the campus network. Basically there's one \"account\" with the telco that has multiple lines which handles everything on campus, and this one single phone that we have that's a completely separate account. And for a very good reason.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo here I am, just after midnight, I'm sitting at the desk watching Netflix when the dedicated line rang. Never a good thing as this line is specifically for the telco that handles the lines coming in to our campus to call us when our main lines go down. Although every now and then someone will dial the wrong number and end up calling it. I answer the phone, it's the telco saying they've received alarms from both main campuses. Goody.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNext step is for me to go through the S.O.P's and do test calls of a few numbers. I can't just dial any number, there's specific ones I have to dial, as each one is on a different node of our on campus network. The idea of these calls is to determine just how large the problem is, is it one node or the whole campus, as the telco only gets an error and nothing specific. And to ensure it works properly, I have to dial the full number as if I'm calling from an outside location, I can't just dial the last 4 numbers as that'll just route the call internally. Sure enough, every single one fails. I can't call outside numbers and nobody from outside can call in. Internal calls still work though so that's handy, means most of our emergency calls will still work.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNow that I know there's a campus wide outage that affects both sites, I have to call out one of the campus telecommunication techs that manage our network with the big telco. First person on the call list is the main guy that manages it. I'll refer to him as Fred. The second number is for another tech in case I can't get a hold of Fred. However, neither of them are answering their phones. Lovely. So while I'm giving it a couple minutes to get my incident report started before trying again, my supervisor is in full micro manage mode and sticking his fingers in to \"assist\" with the situation. Except he's not listening to me. He decides to call the overnight engineers to see if they can call Fred. Even though it's not their responsibility at all, even though I'm handling it. He has it in his mind that Fred won't recognize the number I'm calling from and won't answer which is why he wants the engineers to try. Except with the phones being down, they can't call outside the internal network, which I try to explain to him but being the most junior on the crew - despite being there for a year - I'm sure you can imagine how well he listened. I try again to call Fred and the second tech while juggling the radio as the guards at the second site are trying to call the desk to confirm what I already know, and I get no answer again from Fred or the other tech.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFinally I call Fred a third time and success! He answers! Except, oh crap. It's his son that answered, whoops. I asked him to go wake Fred as we have a situation we need him to fix. In the meantime my supervisor is again badgering, I tilt the phone away as I tell him it's ok, I have it under control, I got through this call.\nAll of a sudden out of the phone I hear a ton of screaming. Not high pitched I'm being murdered screaming, I'm talking horrified I-just-saw-something-I-can't-unsee screaming, lots of f bombs are being dropped, kids yelling at his dad it's the university calling, and I can hear in his voice he's horrified by what he walked in on. As I'm listening to this, I'm going red faced in my chair, biting my hand to stifle my horrified and shocked laughter, and my supervisor is giving me a WTF look. I just inadvertently interrupted happy fun times between Fred and I'm assuming his wife, and his poor son had the unfortunate luck to answer my call and walk in on them getting it on.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNext thing I hear is Fred on the phone, slightly high pitched voice from embarrassment, I quickly identify myself and tell him all the phone lines are down, he says he'll get on it and we hang up. I have no idea who wanted off the phone faster, me or him.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPhones were fixed about an hour later, but I think there's going to be some changes to the call out list. Or at least new house rules for Fred's house.",

        "text": "I was patrolling an area of the freeway where almost nothing ever happens, just to see if there were any stranded motorists or abandoned stolen cars. For whatever reason, that particular section of freeway is always kept in great shape. There's a few exits across a 10 mile stretch, and a few curves, but it lends itself to high speed driving as it's usually pretty empty. I'll always remember radio traffic I heard from a Trooper who always runs LIDAR there; \"If anyone is in position, I just had a black BMW pass me going 142 (MPH). I'm not going to catch him.\"\n\nI did a check of the beat, and didn't find anything, so I took an on-ramp going back the other direction. While taking the ramp, a black Camaro ZL1 (which has about 580hp) just about blew my doors off. My obvious reaction was to put the pedal to the floor. As he flew by, I could see he was braking pretty hard.\n\nWe had been getting into trouble with pursuits. We kept chasing people for things like broken tail lights and expired registration, and management wasn't happy about all the damage that was being caused over minor violations. So I didn't say anything over the radio, and I didn't turn my lights on. If he was going to plow into somebody innocent before I could catch up, that was going to be on him.\n\nAt about the time I hit 95mph, I saw he was off the brakes...and had begun pulling away. This may be a surprise, but a Crown Victoria does not quite have 580hp. He was about a quarter mile ahead of me, and heading into traffic. So he made the worse decision he could've made and swerved from the fast lane, across 3 lanes, and took the exit, nearly losing control in the process. You have to slow down for exits, which gave me the chance to catch up.\n\nThe exit was pretty long, with curves and trees, so I lost sight of the car. At the bottom of the exit was a stop light. It was red. I looked straight ahead, no Camaro. To my left, no Camaro. My view to the right was blocked. Well, pretty good odds on where he went.\n\nI turned right and found myself in a court. No Camaro. I guess that one got away. I kept turning right and saw an open gate into a secure business parking lot. Or semi-secure, I guess. Low and behold, the Camaro was pulling through the gate. I finally turned my lights on and follow him in, at which point he pulled into a parking spot and turn the car off.\n\nSometimes people run because they don't want a ticket. Sometimes people run because they don't have a valid driver's license. And sometimes people run because they just murdered their family at their house and are on a rampage. I never know which one it is until I talk to the person.\n\nSo I got out of my car, unholstered my gun, kept it at my side, and stayed behind the cover of my car. *Technically*, the only violations he committed were speeding and an unsafe lane change. I didn't have my lights on until we were doing 15 mph in a parking lot, even though it seemed pretty apparent he was trying to get away. But his speed and lane change were good enough to go to jail for reckless driving.\n\n\"Roll down all your windows!\" They were all tinted. He rolled them down. \"Hands up!\" He put them up. \"Take the keys out!\" He took the keys out. I holstered my weapon and walked up.\n\nI let him know, \"That was a very stupid decision.\"\n\nHe replied, \"Yes sir, it was.\"\n\n\"Any particular reason for your speed?\"\n\n\"I'm test driving the car to see if I want to buy it.\" Fair enough.\n\nHe was about 19 years old, with a valid drivers license, and all the paperwork in the vehicle was in order. I can't say I was never a stupid 19 year old going way too fast on the street.\n\nI considered my options, and walked back with a ticket. \"So, here's the deal. You're getting a ticket for what I know you were doing, which is 95mph, and that was after you were braking, so I'm pretty sure you were going faster. The stupid things you did afterwards could easily land you in jail. In the future, go to a race track.\" I provided the name of some local ones he could go to and legally drag race. He said he was aware, and was planning on doing so. He also told me it was a pretty good test drive, and he'd be buying the car.",

        "text": "This is a short little story that has stuck with me for about six years now and that I'm primarily posting to maybe get some clarification on. Also I'm on a phone, so I apologize in advance.\n\nWhen I was about 20 living by myself for the first time in undergrad, I had an apartment about a mile off campus. Seeing as how I was extremely poor, I tended to just walk to class and work (I worked for the university at the time).\n\nThe school was one of the bigger institutions in the state that was in a period of growth, transitioning from a commuter school to something more like what idealistic high school kids think of as \"college\". My point being: the demographic was slowly shifting in certain areas (my neighborhood) from lower income to college students. So walking was generally fine, but I always tried to be aware of my surroundings. \n\nBut yes, the story. So this day in particular, it was probably about 10 or 11 in the morning. I had gotten ready and had begun my normal walk to campus. I made my way down the back alley to the sidewalk.\n\n\"Jeff!\"\n\nI likely was dicking around on my phone at the time. I didn't even turn toward the noise as my name is jFolis, not Jeff. Plus it sounded far off. I kept walking.\n\nAbout two minutes later from about the same distance:\n\n\"Hey, Jeff!\"\n\nBy this point I had made it to the end of my block. This time I turn to see a white guy in his 30s, wearing a tucked in polo and sunglasses, walking behind me about 50 feet away. He seems to be matching my pace, so really just appears to be walking casually. My thought process at this point is:\n\nThe sound came from that direction.\nThere's a guy.\nDid he say that?\nDoesn't matter. I'm not Jeff.\n\nMind you, I'm a default white guy. So, while I don't like to think that profiling happens, if it did, I'd likely be the last person to experience it. So, even at this moment in the story, I have no concerns and have detected no threat.\n\nSo, now at the corner of my block, I make a left and cross the street, continuing onto the main drag that leads to campus. Along this sidewalk, there are three or four newer duplexes spaced about ten feet apart.\n\nImmediately after I pass the first duplex, I hear it once more:\n\n\"Hey, Jeff!\"\n\nBut this time, the voice is particularly commanding. Simultaneously, another man comes out from between the next two duplexes and intercepts me — he is also dressed in this same polo/sunglasses combo.\n\nOf course, at this point I realize something is up. I begin noticing that these polo strangers are descending upon me from literally every angle.\n\n\"Hey, Jeff. How's it going, man?\"\n\nOne of the men is now approaching me.\n\nNow, I don't know about anyone else, but there is a very specific way I've noticed that police officers say sentences that would otherwise be very friendly, but they find a way to make you wanna shit yourself. Again, maybe it's me, but this was one of those moments.\n\nKind of like he meant to say:\n\"Hey, Jeff. How's it going, man? I'm about to kick your ass.\"\n\nAnyway.\n\nAs soon as I really look up from my phone and he gets within six feet of me, he stops short. At this point I notice the badge hanging around his neck.\n\n\"You're not Jeff.\"\n[to the other guys who are now pretty close]\n\"This isn't Jeff.\"\n\nHe looks back at me and seems noticeably embarrassed, but is playing it off.\n\n\"I'm sorry. What's your name, sir?\"\n[I reply]\n\"Oh, okay, jFolis. You have a good day.\"\n\nHe shakes my hand awkwardly and then he and the rest of them (who I assume were undercover cops) just walk off. No explanation.\n\nSo yeah, that's it. Really weird and concerning. Makes me wonder what Jeff could have done to warrant that kind of response and tactic.\n\nBut yeah, I'd love to know what anyone thinks may have actually been going on. I've wondered for years now why a bunch of undercover cops would do this.\n\nEdit: Clarified that I knew these were cops at the end of the ordeal.",

        "text": "My boyfriend was working graves and asked me if I wanted to come on a ride along, which I thought would be fun. I spent the entire shift with him, and there really wasn't any down time like I expected…one call after the other but nothing too crazy. Then about 2 in the morning, he got called to this really sketchy part of town. We get there and there are 3 guys milling around in the middle of the street. Another officer was already there so he and my bf started asking them questions. One of the guys started stretching, and then out of nowhere turns and books it up the street and around the corner. My boyfriend and the other officer immediately took off after him, totally out of sight after they went around the corner. Then i realized it's the middle of the night, no one around, and I was alone in the street with a couple of drug dealers (or whatever they ended up being). They started talking to each other in Spanish, which I couldn't understand, and then suddenly looked over at me and one of them said, \"Who the fuck are you?\" I'm not sure why they didn't take off running themselves, and I had no idea what to say, I was scared to death because I'm this little 5'4, 115 pound girl who was clearly not there in any official capacity. They started saying some lewd things while I stood there frozen, not really knowing what to do. (I'd be the worst cop.) Luckily, right about then a couple other police cars came tearing up the street with their lights on. Apparently my boyfriend remembered I was there and called for back up while he was running. When they got back and everything was all settled down we all laughed and gave him a hard time for it, even though I felt kind of bad. He made me stay in the car the rest of the night. It turned into a joke between us (\"Remember that one time you left me alone with those drug dealers?\") I went on a few more ride alongs with him over the course of our relationship but none of them were quite as eventful as that.

        "text": "I did a ride-along with a Sheriff's Department in SoCal on a Friday night in June. I get paired up with a young guy, 5 years on the job and 3 on patrol. They do one to a car and work 12s. This shift was 1900-0700. Of course, I was up at 0700 for work as I customarily am, so I'm tired coming on shift. \n\nWe chat some about the job and our backgrounds (I'm from OK and have a long history with first responders) and he shows me the usual stuff- light bar, console controls, computer for running tags, and the release for the shotgun and Mini-14 in the cab. Cool.\n\nThrough the night we do the usual busting of druggies, public drinking, and noise, and then we roll by a closed bar around 0210. Now, by this point I had asked him if I had some grounds to fight back if somebody we stopped took a swing at me or him. He told me essentially \"hell yes, and if I'm getting my ass beat help and we'll square it later\". This'll come up later (not me fighting, but part of the decisions I made). \n\nDeputy Smith (not his name) immediately pulls into a neighboring parking lot and says:\n\n \"Oh, watch this\". *...okay?* \"There's going to be three cars that'll come out of here in just a second-- I want the little sedan\". \n\nThis isn't the first time on shift he's picked out a car for something suspicious that I didn't see, but literally every car we pulled over had drugs in it, so I went with it. \n\nCar one pulls up and turns east- a two door Honda. Second car pulls up- another Honda- and turns west. Third car pulls up and it's a big black SUV. \n\n\"Shit, I didn't see that one. One more.\"\n\nFinally, a blue Ford Focus four door pulls up and we pull level with it, both facing south, about 50 yards apart. The driver just stares at us in the darkness, and decides to try and back up. He shifts from drive to reverse about three times before deciding this is his life now and pulls out of the parking lot westbound. \n\nWe pull up behind him fairly close and try to get a read on his tag to run, while the Focus pulls north into a residential area and promptly California rolls a stop sign to go back eastbound (two right turns). Oops. \n\nSmith flips the lights to pull him over, and he begins to pull to the side and halfway stop, halfway keep going. It really seems like he's indecisive about whether he's going to stop or not. \n\n\"Aw, man. He's going to run. You watch\". *...okay.*\n\nSmith takes a couple of steps out of the Explorer toward the finally stopped Focus when, sure enough, the driver floors it. \n\nSmith jumps back in the Explorer and goes code 3, calling it in on the radio. Backup is around 5 minutes away. Driver exits the residential and proceeds westbound on the original street we began following him, and we see him toss something out the window. \n\nSpeeds stayed around 50 for close to three miles as he wove through oncoming traffic (thankfully light at 0220). Finally, he turns south on a road which runs all the way through the next town south. All of this road is residential. We proceed to pursue this guy south on this road for 4.9 miles, reporting every single cross street stop sign and red light he blows. Suspect vehicle was travelling in excess of 75mph.\n\nAt the end of this road is a set of train tracks, but that's on the far side of a concrete drainage area. The driver failed to see the end of the road coming up, and hit his brakes while turning the vehicle to the right. His left front quarter panel struck the far side of the ditch, rotating the Focust 90 degrees to the right and dropping it 5 feet straight down into the bottom. \n\nAt this point we saw (miraculously) the driver digging in the passenger seat of the Focus. Smith leaped out of the Explorer and drew on him, ordering his hands up and to exit the vehicle. \n\nThe driver froze and complied, extricating himself via the drivers' side window as the door was pinned by the embankment. Smith approached him to arrest him for a variety of offenses, but as soon as Smith holstered his weapon the driver bolted on foot. \n\nAt this point I'm still in the Explorer, one hand on the weapon release, not knowing whether I should pursue and help Smith. Dispatch is calling \"*One Paul 12, location? One Paul 12 respond*.\" \n\nNothing from Smith. Either he's in trouble or his lapel mic are gone, or both. I made a judgement call and picked up the radio, relaying our position via the road we pursued the Focus down and the nearest cross street, also noting that Smith had bailed on foot to pursue south and east over the railroad tracks. \n\nThe guy was caught not 50 yards from his car, but proceeded to struggle with Smith for almost 5 minutes before backup arrived (it's a big county- a local city officer was actually there first). \n\n**BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE**.\n\nWith the suspect in custody, and Smith okay, suspect begins to complain of chest pain. Well no shit, asshole. We asked what he was on-- meth and a 'few beers'. So he's high and drunk, crashed a (we later learned) stolen Focus, ran, fought, and lost. Your chest is going to hurt. \n\nParamedics think he's faking and will transport to a local hospital. Sargent orders me and Smith to go with and retain custody. It's now 0315. I'm fucking beat. \n\nDude gets into the ICU where the night nurse agrees he's being a baby, but orders a CT scan anyway to confirm. Well apparently a lot of people need CT scans on a Friday night. We sit for three hours and he gets his CT at 0630. \n\nAt 0650 (I've been up 24 hours) the doctor comes back and says:\n\n*So you know how we all thought this guy was just being a baby? Turns out he has a closed pneumothorax, left side.* God. Damn. It. This happens when blunt force is applied to the chest- essentially your lung tears and forces air into your chest cavity, slowly increasing the pressure on your organs until one fails. \n\nThe medical students assemble to see a fun procedure. they dress him up and cut open the chest, then proceed to stick a finger in for good measure \"because sometimes the lung gets stuck to the ribs\". They install a chest tube to relieve the pressure and save his life.\n\nOur relief didn't come until 0945. Smith got some bitchin' overtime pay and a new appreciation for cardio, and I got a kickass story.",

As soon as I was walking up, he started yelling for me to shoot him, and started cutting on his own arm.\n\n\nI had stopped a good distance back (outside the 21 foot range), drawn my pistol (92F) and yelled for him to drop the blade. I could hear approaching sirens from at least two cars so I knew I'd have backup in moments who would be able to help, if they got there in time.\n\n\nHe heard them as well though, started yelling even louder for me to shoot him, and started stomping towards me... I was able to back up a bit while further yelling for him to drop it, but he was closing the distance. I couldn't keep backing up, as there were several other shoppers in the parking lot, several standing around staring at the scene (these days the idiots would probably have their cells out videoing).\n\n\nFinally I had to stop, and I saw one of the other patrols pull into the far end of the lot... but he just kept coming. I raised my weapon from ready to aiming, while ensuring no one was behind him if the round went through, and started to pull the trigger.\nTo this day I have no clue really why... maybe it was my stance, the look on my face, actually, really looking down the dark barrel of my pistol... but he dropped the machete.\n\n\nI was able to stop pulling in time while also lowering my pistol. I had pulled it more than half-way, as it was sitting in the weapon's half-cock detent.\n\n\nHe just dropped to his knees crying as my back up rushed in and separated him from the blade and cuffed him.\n\n\nSince he had only hurt himself, the JAG passed on charges and he got handed off to mental health. Never heard what became of him, but I still remember that day crystal clear.",

        "text": "Anyone who became a State Trooper after the movie Super Troopers came out would be lying if they said that movie didn't affect their decision. I got to act out a small clip from that, albeit not intentionally.\n\nI was working on a weekend in heavy traffic. There wasn't a lot going on, and a new guy, Gallegos, transferred in recently. He was trying to get a layout of the area. I showed him a spot that was easy for tickets due to a restricted lane on the freeway for emergency vehicles only. Lots of signs saying it was restricted. But by taking this lane, you'd save 30 minutes and bypass 100 cars. So we had someone illegally use that lane every 1 or 2 minutes. And it was completely separated from the regular lanes, so once you were in it, you were committed.\n\nWe pulled into a spot to watch the lane, and Gallegos called me on my phone. \"So...I see the sign. That means only emergency vehicles?\" I confirmed it. \"So anyone going through right now not driving an emergency vehicle is breaking the law?\" I confirmed again. He couldn't believe how simple it was and how many people ignored it. As we were having this conversation, a couple cars passed us. He kept asking, \"Okay, I get it, but what code---\" I had to cut him off as I saw a limo in my rear view mirror.\n\n\"Sorry man, I gotta go stop this moron.\" I hung up. I mumbled, *What a complete idiot.* The limo caught my attention for driving in the lane. As the other cars went by and demonstrated, not that unusual. What was unusual was that it came to a complete stop once the driver saw me. And then went into reverse. On the freeway.\n\nSo now that driver had broken the law three times; restricted lane, unnecessary stop on a freeway, and unsafe backing.\n\nI went full lights and sirens, and floored it...in reverse. That opening scene in Super Troopers with the stoners? Just like that. Only I wasn't in a lane, so not completely reckless. Interestingly enough, training at my academy specifically included driving backwards at high speeds.\n\nI watched as the limo continued to back up. He was committed a good 1000 feet into the restricted lane. He finally got back to where he could get out of the lane, and cut back into the main freeway. And this was right as I flew by him, going backwards. I slammed on the brakes and pulled behind him. \n\n\"PULL THE VEHICLE OVER!\" I commanded over the PA. He was already pulled over.\n\nI contacted him, and I didn't give him a chance to explain why he did what he did. I told him what I saw him do, and he just nodded.\n\nAs I had him pulled over, another car took the restricted lane. A driver stuck in traffic yelled to me, \"Hey, isn't that restricted?!\" I confirmed it. \"But they just took that lane!\" I watched as the car continued on, looked at the limo I stopped, looked at the driver yelling to me, and yelled back, \"I can't stop them all!\"\n\nBut I sure can stop a lot.",

        "text": "Life as an Air Force Cop,working stateside on Air Force bases, could best be compared to random episodes of the \"Andy Griffith Show\" if Mayberry occasionally also hosted  the rare episode of \"Cops: Drunk and Stupid Perps\".\n\nThis of course means that the average 12 hour *Day* shift is a *usually* a mix of boredom, traffic enforcement (usually in the school zones), the occasional traffic accident, the rare shoplifting call and the ever-fun enforcement of Base rules/laws that the Wing Commander has passed down we focus on.\n\nThis particular week (many years ago), being the second week of summer vacation for the local school kids, and right after a skateboarding injury incident in housing, it was passed down that we would be focusing on enforcement of base Safety regs...  If you are riding a bike, you must be wearing a helmet.  If you are skateboarding or rollerskating, you must be wearing not only a Helmet, but also knee-pads, elbow-pads and [wrist-braces](https://sc01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1bkk8HpXXXXauaXXXq6xXFXXXX/223536252/HTB1bkk8HpXXXXauaXXXq6xXFXXXX.jpg).\n\nFor several days of the week, we encountered various base kids breaking the rules, stopped them, explained the rules, noted the names/addresses of the rule breakers and more importantly their parents.  The kids were directed to walk home to get their proper equipment before returning to their fun.  Warning notes were passed through military channels to the parents,reminding *THEM* of the rules and directions to enforce the laws with their kids or else face punishment themselves for not properly controlling their dependents.\n\nThe occasional repeat offenders we'd actually pick up and escort to their parent's locations, home if possible, but all the way to their parent's work if needed to hand them off.  That usually stopped any further repeat offences from those particular kids.\n\nThen there was Joey. \n\nI'm fairly certain Joey is currently a mid 30's  member of his local Occupy movement, angrily protesting something...  if not in jail somewhere.  He had the eternal \"Fuck authority and rules, they don't apply to me\" mindset.\n\nWe had stopped Joey to brief him about needing his safety gear for his skateboard several times, including taking him home to his Mom three times.  She was the standard oblivious mother who had no clue what kind of miscreant her spawn truly was, while his poor dad was deployed.\n\nSo there we were, driving through housing on Friday afternoon, having just turned onto one of the side streets from the main housing road...  Up ahead... Joey.  I flashed to having seen the movie [\"Snow Day\"](https://youtu.be/za7h2WdcieI) and almost felt bad as my partner started driving towards him...  until Joey shot us the bird and raced off on his skateboard that is.\n\nWe leisurely followed (speed limit in housing is only 15 mph and this wasn't exactly any kind of code response), slowly catching up as he skateboarded for all he was worth...  kicking hard, popping sweet ollies off curbs and back up onto sidewalks... great moves for a 10 year old skater.\n\nThen, just as we were about to pull alongside of him to remind him we already knew where he lived and that trying to run was silly, he tried to pop up onto one last curb... but did a flat-planted jump instead, causing him to land on his feet on the sidewalk, and his board to shoot straight down one of the [gaping storm drains](https://arlingtonva.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2016/01/Storm-drain.jpg) we had in housing to handle the desert rains.\n\nWe stopped and watched him curse a blue streak that probably taught my younger driver a few new words, then saw his shoulders slump as he turned toward us and started to move to back seat door...  only to see his shocked face as the door locked in front of him.  He looked up at us and I told him, \"Well, no board means we don't have to take you home...  walk safe!\"\n\nI'm pretty sure he was inventing new swear words as he yelled at us as we drove off laughing.\n\n(Edit:  Timeline clarification comment added to help any confused by my original less than perfectly clear writing.)\n",

        "text": "*Sorry I've been MIA for so long. Work is nuts. Stop breaking the law, jerks.*\n\n\n“I’ll let you guys know if I see anything down there.” The door shut behind me before I heard my team’s response. Everyone was getting crushed with cases and thanks to a recent reorganization of my unit, we had far fewer people to work more cases than ever. The case I was heading to, though, deserved some attention. Homicide had reached out to me the day before to assist in locating a suspect in a few months old murder they were working. \n\nThe subject, Chevy, was well known to me and Biggs (who was now perched up on the Homicide squad) from our days on the repeat offender team and it didn’t come as a surprise when his face popped up on the surveillance video Biggs had been mining for potential leads. Detectives had approached him weeks after the murder, desperate for something more tying him to the case. That evidence didn’t come then, nor for the few months following. Eventually though, a break came, warrants were sworn out, and my phone began ringing off the hook.\n\n“Yo!” I said with a chipper voice into the air of my cruiser’s cabin, the Bluetooth picking up so I could maneuver out of my cramped parking lot. “I’m heading down to Chevy’s girl’s place. Everything I found points to it as his primary residence.”\n\n“Me too. I’ve been going over records all morning.” Biggs replied, typing away at his desk computer even as we spoke.\n\n“Cool. I’ll get set up and see what I see.” \n\n“You grabbing him tonight?” Biggs’ interest was piqued and I could tell he wanted in on the action. The homicide office can get boring after a while. \n\n“Nah, barring the perfect scenario. I’m flying solo, everyone is tied up with crap.”\n\n“I know the feeling,” Biggs sighed. “I’ll be glad when this one’s off my plate.”\n\n“Cool. I’ll keep you updated man. If I gotta shoot him, I’ll tell him you sent me before the deed’s done.”\n\n“Please do.” I knew Biggs’ disdain for Chevy ran deep. He had been the thorn in our side for a while during the repeat offender days, and Biggs had personally gotten to the point of hand-to-hand with him on at least a couple occasions. \n\nThe drive was longer than normal thanks to the evening traffic. When I finally arrived in Chevy’s neighborhood the sun was starting to paint the sky a burning orange tint. I found a good spot and nestled in, lowering my driver’s seat back and resting the binoculars onto my chest. An hour passed and the sun’s palette transitioned to darker shades. There was no movement at the house.\n\nI heard the car before I saw it. The low bass tones grabbed my attention, causing me to check the rear view. It was a white Cadillac, creeping up the street with a driver that looked a lot like Chevy. I ducked down in my seat more, grateful for the dark tint and out of state tags on my undercover cruiser. As the car rolled by, I confirmed my target had just arrived home, and he didn’t so much as glance in my direction. \n\nI sat up a bit once he was past and began training my binoculars on him. Chevy took his time parking, nose to the curb and protruding annoyingly into the cul de sac – typical. He got out, glanced around a bit, then reached back into the car and pulled out what looked to be a blunt from the ash tray. His dreadlocks bobbed while he nodded his head along with the bass and he mouthed the words to whatever terrible song he was listening to as he let the tendrils of smoke creep out his lips. He glanced around again before pulling out a back pack and slamming his door. He trotted up the steps to the front door and opened it without using his keys to unlock it. I’d call that definitive evidence of first party residence. \n\nNot wanting to push my luck on being spotted, I waited a few minutes before leaving the neighborhood. I had written down my findings (tag number, time of arrival, and unhindered entry into the home demonstrating he lived there) and sought out a parking lot to draft my email planning the operation to take down Chevy the following day. \n\nI had trouble sleeping that night. A combination of potential disasters and worry about failure and wasting everyone’s precious time took turns assaulting my closed eye lids. Morning came too quick and I knew I’d be working with less than 100% of my wits. Oh well, that’s why coffee exists. \n\n“Here’s our guy. Chevy is a career criminal.” I passed around a full sized mugshot to the group of eight who were able to assist. “Convicted felon by sixteen, history of firearms and violence. I can’t find a real job but it looks like he’s still big in the weed and coke game around here. The house belongs to his girlfriend’s parents and I’d like to avoid it if possible. It would be best to wait close, see him coming, call him out on the radio, and take him in his car. I can’t get a good return on the tag, they’re probably fake, but it’s a mid-90’s white Cadillac with an annoying stereo. Feel free to ram the hell out of it.”\n\nWe suited up and headed to Chevy’s neighborhood again. I took the first turn with the “ball”, parking down the street from the house and capable of seeing it and the road leading in both directions away from the cul de sac. The waiting game started with little fanfare. \n\nA couple hours passed and I had too quickly burnt through my drinks and snacks which I had hoped would last the length of the operation. I was cursing my nervous eating habit when the radio piped up. \n\n“Bad news fellas.” It was the Lt, delegated to a far-away position so he didn’t have to see the use of force that might happen if it hit the fan. “Sounds like we have a bank robber holed up in a house up on North-side. Captain called and needs at least three of us to break off.”\n\n“Are you f’ing kidding me?” I asked the radio. “We’ve got a murderer that should be rolling up any minute and they want to pull half of us for a barricade? Where’s SWAT?” \n\n“Oh, they’re going too, but you know them: it’ll be two hours before they feel obligated to push everyone aside to take over the scene. I guess we’ll be the contingency plan until that happens.”\n\n“That’s bullcrap.” I could only laugh. \n\n“I agree.” Lt seemed annoyed as well which made me feel a bit better. “You’re staying here, EMR. Who’s going?” Slowly, three guys reluctantly piped up. \n\n“I’m going to need a guy up here to replace Mikey.” I broadcast. “And Mark had a good spot up the road. Someone take that over too.”\n\n“Direct!” Lt chirped. “I’m taking a minute to make some phone calls, will be off comms for a couple.” Awesome. We were down to four. \n\n“Well fellas.” I started into the radio. “Things just got a whole lot more Wild West up in here.”\n\nI returned to watching the house, annoyed and cranky from lack of sleep. \n\nSeveral minutes passed before I heard the bass. It woke me from my glazed-over state and I snapped the radio to my mouth. “Where’s that bass coming from. Anyone?” \n\n“Nothing on Elm.” Stan said. \n\n“What about Oak? Jim?” My question lingered in dead space. “Jim? Copy??” I realized my heart was racing, a fact that was probably clear over the air. Still no reply from Jim. \n\n“Can anyone see down Oak? Where Jim’s parked?” I asked.\n\n“EMR, car’s heading in!!” Jim yelled into the radio. \n\nI looked into my rear view, pointing behind my parked car towards Oak Street. The Cadillac crept into view. “I got him. We have positive ID?” \n\n“It was his dreadlocked, ugly ass.” Jim said, I could hear his car engine start over the air. \n\n“Chad, be ready with that front block. You guys creeping in? Lt – you in the game?” I gripped the steering wheel tight and ran my tongue over already stress-dried lips. \n\n“I’m direct on front block.” Chad said. Lt didn’t answer. I assumed he was still on the phone.\n\nThe Cadillac made the turn into the cul de sac. None of my team’s cars were behind him. “Welp! I guess I have rear block Chad.” I turned my vehicle down the road right behind Chevy and straightened out.\n\n“GO GO GO GO!” I yelled into the mic. Chad’s minivan tore forward, contacting Chevy’s Cadillac while I made contact with the car’s trunk. I was out the door, gun drawn, screaming orders in half a second. \n\n“HANDS! HANDS WHERE I CAN SEE THEM!” Sirens rang out behind me. Chad drew his weapon and trained it on Chevy, one handed, as he fled wide out of his car and around to the passenger side of my car. “CHEVY, THIS IS THE POLICE! WE GOT A WARRANT FOR YOU!”\n\n“Watch those hands.” Chad huffed in a low voice, panting from his sprint but eyes and gun dialed in on the vehicle. “Where are those assholes?” \n\n“Dunno, but we might have to do this just the two of us.” I Made eye contact with Chevy in his side view mirror. He looked annoyed. “Chevy! With your right hand, slowly turn off the car and drop the keys out the window!” I called out. Chevy stared back and made no move to comply. “KEYS! OUT OF THE IGNITION, OUT OF THE CAR!” I tried a less gentle approach. \n\nChevy lowered his left hand a bit, to his mouth it turned out, then raised it back up to its previous position. He was chewing a mouthful of what looked like a white chocolate macadamia cookie. \n\n“DROP THE FUCKING COOKIE AND TURN THE CAR OFF!” I yelled. Chad scoffed to my right. Chevy slowly complied. Tires came to a screeching halt behind me and Stan came jogging up behind me. \n\n“Sorry, some asshole cut me off. Whata we got?”\n\n“He’s being a bit of a dickhead but the car’s off at least.” \n\n“We got company, at least three cell phones from the look of it.” Stan reported. I knew he meant we were being recorded by the locals. Hopefully we weren’t going to give them and the evening news something to get excited about. The fourth and final of our group rolled up and a second later Jim fell in line behind me. \n\n“Sorry, was taking a piss.”\n\n“Retard.” Stan muttered. \n\n“What?!? Am I supposed to go in my pants?”\n\n“Shut up.” I said. “Chad, I’m going to start getting him out.”\n\n“Ok. I haven’t seen anyone else, just him.”\n\n“Stan, Jim, you guys are hands. I’ll stay gun-on until you tell me to stop.” I said, not looking away from Chevy’s eyes in the mirror. They kept darting to the passenger side, and I was getting a bit hinked out by it. “Chevy. Take you left hand and reach out the window. Open the car door from the outside. Do it, NOW!”\n\nChevy’s jaw flexed but he slowly complied again. He dropped the half eaten cookie and grabbed the handle. The door popped open. \n\n“Now, swing out your legs and exit, looking away from me. Keep your hands where we can see them, don’t reach for anything and I won’t kill you.”\n\n“Nice.” Stan chuckled. \n\n“Just being honest.” I mumbled back.\n\n“Now, slowly walk backwards to me. STOP!” Chevy was three feet from the car, still listening to me. “Put your hands palm down on your head, interlace your fingers, and leave them there. Good! Now keep walking back to me. Slowly, slowly. One more step. One more. One more…” Jim and Stan were moving towards Chevy while he continued to slowly step in our direction. The each grabbed a wrist and wrenched him backwards, behind my vehicle. \n\n“Chad, I got driver’s side. Come to me and let’s clear this thing.” He jogged over and gripped my shoulder, indicating he was ready to advance. We slowly approached and cleared the vehicle, confirming we had no other occupants. I was able to take a full breath again. \n\nStan and Jim had cuffed Chevy. I glanced around at the three neighbors pointing cell phones at us. “Wave to YouTube, fellas!”\n\n“Baby!” A woman came running toward us. \n\n“Whoa whoa whoa!” Jim yelled, throwing his hands up to block the woman. “Back up! Police!” \n\n“You can’t take him!” The woman was already sobbing. \n\n“He has a warrant.” I said, approaching her so Jim wasn’t one on one. \n\n“You can’t!” I recognized her as Chevy’s girlfriend, hard to do with the contorted face and running mascara. “He’s got bills to pay!”\n\nChad laughed behind me. “You hear that? It’s not love! It’s bills!”\n\n“Shut the fuck up motha-fucka!” Chevy was getting rowdy. \n\n“Get him in a cruiser before the IRS shows up please.”  I told Chad. Chevy was wrestled into a cruiser. Stan was already documenting the vehicle takedown and taking an inventory of the Cadillac. We were going to tow the car as evidence. \n\n“Ho-lee shit.” Stan said.\n\n“What?” \n\n“Glovebox. Dumdum has a choppa.”\n\nI leaned into the driver’s door and looked where Stan was pointing. A Mac-10 was staring back at me. “Hmph.” I said. “I guess that was what he was looking at.”\n\nStan stayed behind to wait for the tow truck, Jim and Chad drove with me to a parking lot to transfer Chevy into my car. Once he was buckled in, he glared at me under a furrowed brow. \n\n“Hey buddy! Remember me?”\n\n“Nah. Why would I remember your bitch ass?” Chevy wasn’t in too congenial a mood. \n\n“Meh. I don’t know, maybe you don’t. What about a guy named Biggs?” \n\nChevy just shook his head and exhaled through his nose. \n",

        "text": "One time when I was about 19, I was at my friend (J)’s house in a very small town next to my town. Her brother (E) and her boyfriend (M) were there and we all decided to drive to McDonald's or something for dinner (this was at about 10pm.) We pull out from in front of their house, make the first left and immediately hear the Whoop Whoop. M is driving and he pulls over immediately. The police officer walks up and says the license plate light is out and he wants to see all of our ID's and vehicle registration/insurance. We all give them over and he goes back to his car. After a couple minutes another cruiser pulls up. One minute later, a third cruiser pulls up. \n\nThe original officer walks back to the car and says that he smells alcohol, and asks if any of us had been drinking (everyone in the car was under 21, except the driver.) I had been with everyone in the car for the last few hours, and nobody had been drinking. We probably smoked a little weed earlier that day, but that and any paraphernalia had been left in the house. The only thing I can think of was that M, the driver, was kind of OCD about hygiene and he probably used mouth wash before leaving the house, as he did that a lot. Anyways, we all said we hadn't been drinking and he walks back to his car, still holding all of our paperwork/ID's. \n\nAt this point, we start worrying a little bit, because although we weren't doing anything wrong, the officer's attitude, the multiple police cars showing up, and the fact that this small town police force has a very bad reputation for unnecessary use of force (mostly tasing), made us start to worry that something bad was going to happen. After about 5-10 more minutes of waiting and worrying, I glance backwards (I was in the back on the driver's side), and I see the officer SPRINTING towards the car. My first thought was \"OMG, something is going wrong and he's going to pull his gun on us and start shouting demands, and this has the potential to turn into a deadly situation.\" He gets to the window, throws the paperwork/ID's into the car and says very quickly, \"Have a nice night.\" He sprints back to his car and the other 2 police cruisers pull off, tires squealing, and the original car that pulled us over does the same. \n\nWe probably sat there for about 20-30 seconds before anyone said anything, as we're all trying to process what just happened. To this day, I have no idea what happened to cause them to all pull away so fast, but it must have been important. I've been pulled over in that township a few more times since, and for some reason it always seems like 1 or 2 extra police cars show up, even for very minor infractions, but as long as I am polite and respectful, they have been polite and respectful to me (and have usually given me warnings on things like tail lights being out!)\n\nEdit: Fixed \"wall of text\"",

        "text": "I received a call of a large piece of concrete blocking the fast lane on the freeway. An SUV had already hit it, and it blew out the SUV's tire. I needed to get there and clear it before it caused something worse to happen. While en route, I watched a black sedan drive on the right shoulder to pass traffic, cut across an exit lane, and merge back in. That little maneuver had them bypass about 30 cars in the process. No cuts allowed on my watch.\n\nI caught up to the sedan and made a stop, with the full intention of giving a warning. My priority was that piece of concrete I needed to get to. The problem with stopping people in a high-crime area is that you often discover they're breaking even more laws.\n\nAs I walked up, I saw the driver was a college-age female with a toddler in the back seat, in a car seat. The sedan was clean and well kept, and the driver was dressed professionally. As with every stop, I asked for her driver's license. I'm required to record it.\n\n\"I don't have a driver's license, but I do have an ID.\" Ugh.\n\nI ran her ID out through my computer. It returned with a suspended driver's license. Not rare at all where I work. Typically, someone will get a ticket, not pay it, and that will suspend their driver's license until they clear it up. Not this woman. Her driver's license was suspended for being a terrible driver (the term is Negligent Operator). It means she's had so many traffic violations and/or crashes in such a short period of time, the state has decided she needs to not drive for at least 6 months. Kind of rare, but not super rare.\n\nI look further into it and she's had five tickets for driving on a suspended driver's license. And she ignored all of them. Didn't pay any of them, didn't go to court. She gets a ticket, ignores it. Gets a ticket, ignores it. Repeat. Because this is so common where I work, the county has decided you don't go to jail for driving without a license, or with a suspended license. You can just get a ticket. Essentially, she's facing zero repercussions for her actions. However, if I feel so inclined, I can still take her to jail for it. And that's usually reserved for repeat offenders, like this driver.\n\nBut I have a higher priority. I walked back up to her, and handed her ID back. \"You have a terrible driving record. You're lucky I have another call right now, or you'd be going to jail and your kid would be going to child protective services. Fix your driving.\"\n\nI went back en route to the concrete, knowing full well that woman was going to continue her terrible habits. Before I could get to the concrete, another vehicle blew a tire as they plowed into it.",

        "text": "Sometimes you'll find yourself realizing that things should have went a different way, but nothing short of divine intervention allowed it to play out differently. \n\nIt's a surreal feeling that is hard to describe. That train you were cussing at, causing you to be late for work, only to find out a terrible car wreck with a fatality occurred in an intersection you would have likely been passing through had you not been delayed. Those times where it feels like time stops as you think... *\"That could have me...\"* \n\nI had an experience like that recently. I'll get to that.\n\nDrug addiction is nothing new. I would respond to an overdose periodically, once every six weeks or so in my generally small but densly populated city. Then all the sudden, as if it happened overnight, it felt like I was responding to an overdose every few days.\n\n The same scene over and over. A young adult, lying in the floor, not breathing. Medics sitting around them, ripping the plastic off various medical equipment making all attempts to bring them back, and fight against the powerful effects of whatever they had put in their body.\n\nI make a quick glance of the scene looking for any evidence of foul play, just incase its not what I believe it to be. Family members crying, screaming, eyes fixed wide open in that all too familiar state of limbo where they believe their loved one is possibly dead, but know there is still a glimmer of hope. Then you hear it. Its a sound hard to describe, but its distinct. It's life returning to the body. A gasp, a gurgle, a choke, a cough, a mixture of all those things. \n\nI had witnessed this same scene, over and over and over. Same exact thing, just different people at a different address. But this particular call threw me a curveball. \n\nI had been warned, over and over, about the dangerous drug now available on the streets. Drug dealers were using this drug, which is 60X stronger than morphine, as a way to cut their heroine and make their product a \"better quality\". When used correctly in a hospital setting, this drug is a wonderful thing. A lot of times providing relief from the excruciating pain experienced by cancer patients.\n\nObviously, the drug dealers arent regulated by the FDA to make sure their product is consistent and of quality. Each drug deal is a form of Russian Roulette. And since they were now using this powerful drug to cut their heroine, countless people found themselves administering their \"normal\" amount of drug that wouldn't otherwise be deadly necessarily, but this batch was different. It was cut with what I will call \"Tango\".\n\nI had been moved to night shift, which was a much slower paced shift than I was use to. On my other shift, I was lucky if I got to sit down to eat. Non-stop, go go go. I realized on my new shift that not only did I usually have time to eat, I didn't even have to call out for lunch and put myself unavailable for calls to do so. If I got hungry, I could just take a few minutes to swing through whatever restaurant was in my area, grab a burger, and eat it in my car or where ever. \n\nI had been on the shift about a month, and never once called out for lunch. On this day however, I did. And I don't know why. I decided I was going to take my 30 minute break at the police department, which was out of my assigned area, just grab me something to eat out of the break room, and relax for a few. Get out and stretch my legs.\n\n20 minutes or so went by un-eventfully. I still had a few minutes left, but heard a medical call come out at an address in my assigned area. Not wanting another officer to have to cover the area I was responsible for, I notified dispatch I would be taking that call and responding from the police department.\n\nUsually, medical calls only require one officer, if that, and the medics. However, this kind of call was a cardiac arrest and someone needed to get there quick. Myself and an assist unit went running code. As they updated me with information of the patient being a 25 year old, not conscious or breathing, I knew without a doubt it was another fricken overdose.\n\nI was maybe 2.5 - 3 miles from the address, but my assist unit beat me there somehow. I didn't think anything of it, it happens.\n\nSame scene. Young male on the floor, medics surrounding him, plastic flying everywhere, sobs, some yells, wide eyed fixed gazes. My partner is standing on the other side of the room. I glance at him and he holds up a small empty baggie in his gloved hand. I nodded.\n\nAfter that, my partner disappeared. I didn't find this unusual or really even notice, he was probably downstairs talking to family members or securing the baggie containing drug residue. \n\nThe choke, the cough, the gasp, the gurgle. He was back. Medics assisted the patient to his feet and held him up walking to the ambulance. \n\n\"Narcan?\" I said to one of the medics as he passed by. He nodded. \n\nThis confirmed what I already knew, it was a drug overdose.\n\nNarcan is this miracle drug that has virtually no side effects. When administered to someone who has overdosed, it very quickly blocks the opioid receptors in the brain rendering heroine, and some other drugs, ineffective. \n\nNarcan is so safe, it is often available to the general public. Many officers are issued Narcan to keep in their patrol car. My department is not one that does so.\n\nMy supervisor walks up to me mumbling something and looking down at his phone. \"What?\"\n\n\"Do you feel ok?\" He looked up and said\n\nI had no idea why he was asking me this.\n\n\"Yeaaaa, why?\" I did feel ok, but I was sweating pretty heavily and felt really hot. It was the middle of summer and I will never for the life of me understand why people refuse to use their air conditioners to keep their home at a comfortable temperature. Personally, I'd go without lights before I'd sit in my own home miserable and sweating, but thats just me.\n\nMy supervisor tells me that my partner, \"Mark\", is being transported to the hospital. My heart dropped in my stomach. \"Oh my God, what happened is he ok?\"\n\nMark had shown me the baggie, and shortly after left the room. He was overwhelmed with a feeling of being faint and just generally unwell. He didn't mention this to anyone as he made his way to the front door where he sank down, collapsing on the stairs of the front porch. He was losing his vision, couldn't feel his face, numbness began spreading down his body. Something was wrong, really wrong, and was getting worse by the literal second. Medics squeezed past him on the stairs coming and going from the ambulance, completely unaware that he was in a serious deteriating condition. Finally someone noticed, \"You ok?\"\n\nHe had to be almost literally carried to the ambulance which was in the driveway all of 10-15 feet away. They check his vital signs and rush him to the hospital. His blood pressure was dangerously low and he was losing consciousness.\n\n*Tango. I knew it*\n\nThis drug is so powerful, that even though Mark was wearing gloves when he removed the baggie from the garbage can,  some minute amount of the Tango found it's way into his body. We can only speculate how this happened. It could have been something as simple as inhaling the fumes, breathing normally, as he bent over above the garbage can to remove the baggie. He could have accidentally brushed his face or arm with one of his gloved hands that had picked up a trace amount from the outside of the bag.\n\nThat is how powerful this stuff is. That is how dangerous this stuff is.\n\nMark gets treated at the hospital and once stable, is released. He never lost consciousness completely so they didn't administer Narcan. They got his vitals stable and he just rode the rest of it out, feeling a little loopy and silly. \n\nNothing else entered my mind other than being thankful he was ok. I chastised him for not telling anyone he was started to feel unwell. But to be honest, I probably would of done the same thinking \"I don't feel good, I need fresh air\" and slid past everyone.\n\nA couple of days later he is able to return to work. I like Mark, have no issues with him what so ever, we just aren't necessarily buddies. Over the next few days, I noticed Mark was seeking me out and striking up conversations with me an unusual amount. I didn't think negatively of this, just noticed it was unusual. \n\nI later found out why. Or the reason I believe is why. \n\nHe had \"that moment\". That surreal moment where you realize it could have been *A LOT* worse than it was. Except he was experiencing a kind of reverse form of it.\n\nA friend of mine on the force told me about a conversation he had with Mark in the days following his return to work. Mark didn't mention any feelings of worrying about himself, or acknowledgment of the severity in what had happened to him. He was thankful for it. I'll explain.\n\n\"I have thought about it over and over, I can't for the life of me remember why I was there when that call came out\" he stated.\n\nThat night, Mark was assigned to the area furthest from the one I was assigned to where the call originated. Aside from lunch and other few things, we don't leave our areas. But for some reason, he did. Didn't notify dispatch he was away from his zone, and can't remember any reason for why he even needed to leave so far out of his area. But when the call came out, he was within half a mile of the address. While I was on one of the only lunch breaks I had taken since starting that shift, placing me further away.\n\n\"All I can think about is what would have happened if 'greatunited' got there before I did. You know she would have looked in that garbage can, just like me. You know she would of confiscated the baggie.\" He said\n\nMark isn't a little guy. He towers over me at about 6'3\" 220 or so pounds. I am an average size female, petite even by some definitions, 5'4' 120 pounds.\n\n\"I barely made it out the front door. She never would have made it out of that room.\" Mark said.\n\nIt never crossed my mind. I was the one that was supposed to be a half mile from the address. I was the one that was supposed to be on scene first. But for some reason, a series of events seemed to play out in order to prevent that from happening. \n\nThinking about it further, it definitely would have hit me harder and made me sicker with my smaller stature and weight, but I doubt I would have died. Medics were either there or almost there when arriving, and Narcan was readily available. \n\nI can't be sure though, all I know is divine intervention felt the need to set in motion a series of events to make sure I wasn't the one to come in contact with Tango. Not that day.\n\nEither way, I was impressed with Marks response to the incident that landed him in the hospital. Which was a reminder of the indescribable brotherhood and bonds formed between officers we work alongside each day. I mean it, we all do, when we say, \"I'd die for. I'd take a bullet for you\". Under other circumstances, he could have died. And all he seemed to care about was, \"Thank God it was me\".\n",

        "text": "Former college security officer, small campus, blah blah blah check my post history here, you'll get the gist of things.\n\nI loved working weekends. There was always something going on, no call was ever quite the same, and tonight was no exception. I was on my own, the clock had just struck 0300, and I was six cups of coffee deep into my friday night/saturday morning. Aside from a few noise complaints things had been uneventful so I was optimistic. That's always a mistake.\n\nWhile we weren't allowed to talk on them (licensing issues and all) our security department had been given three police radios to listen on, just in case a 911 call went out somewhere on campus and nobody bothered calling the security hotline phone I carried. I had just finished another patrol around campus when the receiver beeped into life.\n\n\"Unit 19, dispatch. Reports of a male subject by the classroom building of the college, possibly intoxicated. RP hung up before I could get more info.\"\n\nSaid unit said he was on the way, and I called the PD's non-emergency number to let them know I'd check it out as well given I was close by. The classroom building sat in the very center of campus, a two minute walk from my office. \n\nI check the back side of the building. Nothing. Same with the east and west. I come around the front, and...\n\nAt first I thought he was wearing a white tracksuit, but it wasn't until I hit him with my flashlight (Fenix FTW) that said \"suit\" turned out to be feathers. Chicken feathers. They fluttered in the breeze as he squatted atop a bench, waving his arms and clucking. \n\nYou ever have one of those moments where your brain just doesn't quite process what it was seeing? Yeah, happened here too. As soon as I turned on my light we both froze, staring at eachother like deer in the headlights. I blinked a few times before approaching.\n\n\"Umm...evening sir, campus security here. Can I ask...what's...what are you doing?\"\n\nHe stopped clucking and waving his arms, his face turning bright red. \"I, uhh...lost a bet.\"\n\nI raised my eyebrow. \"I can tell. You have some ID I can look at?\"\n\nHe hands over his DL just as the officer pulls up. He gets out of his car and stops dead in his tracks before immediately jumping back in, head buried in the steering wheel and laughing hysterically. I was barely holding it in myself. Said officer finally calms down enough to get out and run his ID, and once he's cleared we get the full story. \n\nApparently this guy had bet his friends that he could get a certain girl to go out on a date with him, but nobody was buying it. Sooo, the logical conclusion was as follows: He gets the date, all his friends have to pay up. If not...he gets turned into a chicken. Clearly things hadn't worked out in his favor, so they covered him in elmer's glue and a metric shit-ton of chicken feathers. \n\nHe was dead sober, psychologically stable, and totally mortified. His friends were also watching the whole thing, recording it from across the field, and took off when we showed up, probably assuming someone was getting arrested. \n\nInstead, he got a cop and security guard dying with laughter. Neither of us had the capacity to even give him a trespass notice, we felt so bad for him. The officer let him go on the stipulation he'd take a selfie with him and pick up the stray feathers. He did so, and wandered off into the night as the officer got back on his radio.\n\n\"Show me clear of the scene, dispatch. Mister Cluck-cluck was moved along and told to get better friends.\" ",

        "text": "The negative are usually the most vocal and of course when it comes to my profession I hear it all the time. \"Pig\", lazy, dirty, corrupt, butt holes... you name it. And that's just the PG rated ones. The truth is, us American citizens are just spoiled. Myself included.\n\n\n  Patrolling today, I see a car broke down and stop to offer assistance.  Turns out the lady's hood came loose and just needed to be resecured. I didnt have rope but brainstormed with what I had in my car and ended up making a pretty legit braided-type rope out of \"POLICE LINE\" tape, and managed to get it secured enough to at least get her home, which was only a few miles away.\n\n During our interaction I noticed she seemed somewhat weary of me, but I'm use to that. She initially tried to wave me off and kept saying she was fine and didn't need help. Something about the look on her face and general body language was different from the usual, \"I hate the police, go away\" types that I frequently get the pleasure of interacting with. I was persistant and didnt want to leave her stranded, but up until I started tying her hood down, she acted like she wanted nothing more than for me to go away, almost like she was scared of me.\n\n She had a VERY thick foreign accent that lead me to believe she was not from the US. I had a fleeting thought of, \"I wonder if that's why she's acting this way towards me, because police are different where she is from\". But didn't think anything else about it.\n\n We get it tied down, she jumps in her car and says maybe now her son will answer the phone and respond to follow her back home in case there were any other problems.  I told her there was no need, I'm already here and can do that. She seemed to really lighten up from this point on, and we spoke about where she lived and what to do if her hood came back up on the way there, etc.\n\nWhen we get to her home, she pulls in and parks. My job was done, so I wave to her as I begin to drive away. She calls out to me flagging me down, so I stop. \n\nHer whole demeanor was different. She smiles and tells me how completely overwhelmed she is that I helped her.  In her thick accent she explains that she is originally from Kenya (I believe?) and just became a U.S. citizen.  There, the police don't help you. When they stop you or have contact with you, they hand you a small book. You're expected to put your identification in there along with bribe money to get out of a ticket/arrest, or whatever the case may be. What happens next is in direct relation to whether or not the \"officer\" is satisfied with the amount.\n\n She was so fascinated by my \"act of kindness\" she asked if I would wait, then went inside to get her son to come and thank me. She said \"I cant believe how nice the police are here\". \n\nIt's all a matter of perspective and sad how often we forget how blessed we are to live here. Police aren't perfect. Departments aren't perfect. Sometimes, a few bad eggs slip through and make us look bad. There is ALWAYS room for improvement; however, considering the enormous responsibility expected of us and the duties required of us, I think we're doing a pretty damn good job.",

        "text": "This sub looks like the right spot to share an old story. This is back maybe 6 years now? I can't remember the exact year anymore.\n\nMy family decided to go on holiday to South Africa, a safari no less and we were at Jo-berg airport.\n\nIf you know anything about South Africa, you'll know that Jo-berg is the last place you want to be, but it's the largest city in SA* (Edited, thank you /u/DaftLord), so international flights go there.\n\nAnyway, we're up at the counter getting our tickets processed when two plainclothed policemen step up and ask, \"Are we the Yi family?\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"We're arresting you on suspicion of trafficking rhino horn.\" They they read us our rights. \n\nWe were taken down to the airport police station (which is below the airport's departure section) and...\n\nNow this is where it gets a little bit spooky.\n\nAll four of us were taken into a tiny room and told to wait. My dad is livid, and mentions calling a lawyer friend he has in South Africa.\n\n*Immediately* we are taken from the room, marched past the cells and taken to the station's garage. From there, no exaggeration either, 8 other police officers were brought into the garage. \n\nBear in mind, this is for a family of 4, Mom, Dad, Teenage YisouKou and my younger brother. Honestly, it seemed overkill.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis whole time, I'm mentally melting on the inside because, sure we were *around* Rhinos, but my real fear was either A: Someone planted something on us, that's how mules work between SA and Hong Kong or B: Someone was about to ask for a bribe.\n\nWe wait a half hour, I know because there was a clock in the garage and with that semi-circle of cops facing us, I could only just stare at the clock rather than make eye contact.\n\nOur bags arrive, with a photographer and a dog + handler.\n\nSpooky bit number 2:\n\n\"Your bags were identified by the dog.\" The plainclothes explained, and then they had the dog check the bags. \n\n*The dog circled the bags and failed to identify*\n\n*The handler GRABBED his dog by the neck, dragged him back to my bag and pointed at it, the dog immediately sat and identified.*\n\nSo, I'm like, well shit, this looks dodgy as fuck already and either they're gonna plant something or what, I dunno.\n\n-----\n\nBags opened. Nothing. We're clean. We're offered no apologies, nor further explanation. We were asked to sign a document indicating that \"The South African police force had done all that was right and necessary.\" \n\nWe signed it because it wasn't worth being held for no reason and missing a flight as a result.\n\n-----\n\nOur ticket counter-guy? Still there. We explained,\n\n\"Yeah, this sort of thing happens. When you get back home, check with the consulate. Make sure you don't have a permanent record here.\"\n\nI don't think I'll ever forget that. \"The innocent have nothing to fear\"... yeah, no.",

        "text": "Each tale from the squad car begins with the officer sitting inside them. Un-named individuals that were called to this profession for reasons unique to each one of them. Shaped in part by the tales we witnessed first hand, both before and after day one of our tour of duty. \n\nI recently dusted off the old journals from my early teenage years and took a stroll down memory lane. \n\n15 years ago I was 13 and didn't have a care in the world. I was raised in a good stable home, but had a rebellious streak like no other. You know what they say about cop's kids. I had no way of knowing that I was about to meet someone who would have such impact on my life that would carry into my adult years as I started my career in law enforcement.\n\nMy best friend was Liz. We came from very different homes. My family was by no means well off money wise, but in the grand scheme of things we were probably considered lower middle class. My parents were and still are married, no abuse, no drama, just like I said: normal. Her home life was unstable to put it mildly. She had 7 brothers and sisters, an unattentive mother and no consistent father figure. They moved from place to place constantly. When we were 13, she lived in a trailer park outside of town. Not the safest place in the world, but its what they could afford.\n\nI loved staying the night at her place away from the watchful eye of parental figures. We were pretty much free to do what we wanted, except on occasion when her little sister would tattle on us and her mother would order us to let her tag along.\n\nWhat I loved most about staying the night there was the fact that there were plenty of \"cute\" boys to hang out with in the park. Cute *bad boys*. My 13 year old favorite. I had never had a boyfriend before and didn't know what to do with all the flirty attention they were giving me, but I ate it up and loved every bit of it.\n\nLiz was dating the baddest of them all, Max. Your typical \"teenage punk\" backwards cap, baggy clothes, mouth like a sailor, and some occasional drug use. He gave me my first cigarette and got me smoking with him regularly. I remember the rush of pure satisfaction that breaking the rules made me feel. It was exhilarating to be bad, after being sheltered and strictly guided by rules from loving parents my whole life. Pushing the limits and the chance of getting caught was all part of the fun.\n\nIt was around this time that I also met *him*, Ryan, the reason for this story.\n\nHe had moved into the trailer park at some point. He and Max became buddies, and I met him the same month he turned 13 during one of my sleep over visits. Nothing struck me one way or another about him initially, that I recall or documented. I remember thinking he was cute but left it at that because he was shorter than me as well as younger. Younger only by 8 months, but ya know, 13 year old me wasn't attracted to younger guys. I wanted an older bad boy, like Max. What can I say, gotta love those adolescent standards.\n\n  \nRyan was more reserved than Max and even at barely 13, had a complex about his image. He always wore button-up shirts and khakis or other nice jeans with his hair gelled down and combed. He wasn't a \"goody two shoes\" by any means, but definitely wasn't as much of a bad boy as Max. He was very much toned down and quieter than his loud-mouthed, \"I don't give a, *uck\" buddy. He was mostly an observer during conversations, but would chip in when talked to directly.\n\nWe were just four kids, enjoying life, and being mildly mischevious if the opportunity arose. When Liz began to suspect that Max had a thing for me it caused all sorts of spats between us. Ryan was always mediating, trying to be the voice of reason and get us to talk things out.\n\nOne morning Liz and I wake up early and go knock on the door of Max's trailer. His grumpy groggy brother shoos us away and tells us Max is sleeping. We then head to Ryan's place to see if he wants to come hang out. His mom answers the door and says he is asleep as well, but let us in and told us we could go wake him up.\n\nWe walk into his bedroom calling his name and he sleepily rubs his eyes trying to get them to open and focus on who is in his room. Once he sees its us, he throws his head back down on his pillow, pulls the blanket over his head and says, \"Man I didn't even get to fix my hair!\" We laugh and pick at him for being so concerned with how he looks.\n\nBut it wasn't just his looks that he was meticulous about. I even noted in my journal that he had a \"perfectly clean\" room. His room was the cleanest in the house. Everything had a place, bed got made, very organized.\n\nSo many stories and conversations, but Ill keep it to the basics for length sake.\n\n A month or so later, I was having a sleep over with some friends from church. We were taking turns calling our various crushes and being giggly young teenage girls. Max didn't have a phone, so I called Ryan. In the middle of our conversation, Ryan hands the phone to some guy named Michael.\n\n\"Soooo, do you like Ryan? I'm just curious\".\n\nThis went on for several minutes with me asking why he wanted to know and refusing to answer the question. I begged him to give the phone back to Ryan, and he eventually did. We picked up where we left off talking about various teenage things before he abruptly asked,\n\n\"So what's the answer?\" \n    \n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"You know, what Michael was asking you about, what's your answer?\"\n\nI smiled realizing that it wasn't just his friend messing with me out of curiousity. Ryan liked me. I was ecstatic. Being shy, I kept saying, \"Oh, I dont know....\" avoiding a direct answer. After going back and forth that way for several minutes he said, \"Fine! You want me to tell you my answer? It's yes. I like you.\" Smiling from ear to ear, I admitted I liked him too. He asked me to be his girlfriend and I said yes.\n\n*Awwwww, happily ever after, right? Right?!*\n\nWrong. What's a good young love story without a plot twisting murder?\n\nI was all about Ryan. He was so much better than Max, I reasoned with myself. I doodled dreamily in my journal about how different Ryan was from Max. Ryan was so sweet, caring, and genuine. We clicked, and talked on the phone for hours on end.\n\n*\"...the stuff we talk about! He told me about his dad and the foster home thing. He told me what he believed love is. He cares so much and he shows it! That's something I never got from Max. Hell I don't even care about him anymore. What did I ever see in him.\"*\n\nI wish now that I could remember more details about that conversation. All I know is what I wrote. I knew he had a tough life, I just couldnt appreciate what exactly that meant and to what degree at that young age.\n\nSince we stayed on the phone so much, I would often half mindedly practice my piano lessons while talking to him. Ryan would always get quiet and listen when I did so. \"God, that was so beautiful\", he'd say. Quite the little charmer, that one. I really liked him.\n\nThere was a time when he mentioned that his mom was talking about moving them to Illinois.\n\n\"Ryan, you can't go!\" I protested.\n\n*\"No man, I ain't going. I'll stay down here and get a winter job if I have to. If I go to Illinois, I'll talk to you all the way up there run away and talk to you all the way back. Ill be poor, but hey.\"*\n\nOther than Liz's place, we would meet up to see each other at the local skating rink. Hold hands and just be cute little \"think they're in love\" kids. We stayed together for some time, but I eventually broke it off with him. \n\n \"The break up with Ryan was pretty rough. He got kind of suicidal. I was crying and begging him not to kill himself. I didn't believe that he really would but I wasn't going to take chances. I tried to let him know how much I cared about him. **Everyone needs to know that someone cares for them.** In the end its the most reassuring thing.\"\n\nReading over that journal entry now gives me chills.\n\nWe drifted apart. We spoke every once in a while, but less and less as time passed. I got distracted with life and moved to another high school for 9th grade. Liz had moved to that high school a year prior. We were still really close and had a large tight knit group of friends we were always going on various adventures with.\n\nAlmost a year goes by before I make any significant mention of Ryan in my journal. My large group of friends and I had plans to go to the mall and hang out for a while this particular weekend.\n\n*\"Ryan mentioned that he would be there too but I'm not counting on that. He is supposed to meet me by the fountain at 6:30.\"*\n\nI make no mention of if he showed up at the fountain, but I did see him at the mall.\n\n*\"I was walking with David when I see Ryan walking toward us on the same side of the hall! I was so excited to see him and gave him a big hug. He looked so hot! He was dressed super nice and had his hair all perfect as usual. We didnt get to talk for long because he said he needed to find his brother.\"*\n\nI hadnt read that journal entry since I wrote it, 13 years ago. I had forgot all about our brief, seemingly insignificant, encounter in the mall.  I barely remember it now, even reading about it. Knowing what I know now, what I wrote next fills me with deep sadness for reasons that I never could have predicted at the time.\n\n*\"... he needed to find his brother. After that I got kind of depressed. When I walked back outside with everyone Eric noticed it and asked me what was wrong. I didn't know what to say, and just brushed it off. Later, Chris came up to me and told me to talk to him about what was bothering me. I put my arms around him and laid my head on his chest but honestly didn't know why I felt so sad.\"*\n\nAll this time later, I know now. It could of been the fact that I was almost 15 and hormonal as a woman going through menopause. It also may be because somehow, in some way, the universe was telling my subconscious that it was the last time I'd ever see Ryan.\n\n  I recorded very little in my journal over that time,  but I do remember what happened next very well.\n\n   I got a call from Ryan one night, randomly. I hadnt talked to him in a month or two. I dont remember what we talked about, probably just life in general. I remember feeling a spark of emotion resurfacing some old feelings. It was just like old times. We never seemed to run out of things to talk about.\n\nOur conversation was interupted from a voice in the background on Ryan's end of the line. I heard someone talking, but couldnt hear what they said. \"Hang on\", Ryan said. \"What?\" After some more mumbling from the background voice, Ryan came back on the phone sounding slightly rushed, \"I gotta go\", he said, \"Ill call you back\".\n\nI hung up the phone and contemplated our old relationship, wondering if I could ever see us getting back together. I wasn't sure. He was 14, I had already turned 15 and had done a lot of maturing over the past almost two years.\n\nI didnt know it then, but there was no need in wasting time wondering about our future together. Everything was about to change.\n\n   I dont know where I heard the news, or from who, but I had already caught wind of the murder before the phone call that day, just a few days after our abruptly ended phone conversation.\n\nIt was summer, I was home alone when the phone rang. SMITH COUNTY CORRECTIONAL FACILITY flashed across the caller I.D. My heart started pounding. I glanced around before I answered as if to check if anyone was looking, even though no one was home. My parents would kill me if they knew. I was halfway through saying \"hello\" when I was interrupted by a voice recording.\n\n\"An inmate from the Smith County Correctional Facility is calling. Do you wish to accept this call?\"\n\n\"Y-yes\", I stammered.\n\n\"Hello?\"\n\n\"Hello?\"\n\n\"Ryan, oh my gosh. What the hell? Wha-...\"\n\n\"Listen, I don't have a lot of time to talk\", he said, \"I didnt do it. You have to believe me.\"\n\nHis voice was mousy and shaky. He sounded terrified.\n\n\"I- I don't know the news is sayi--\" I stuttered back\n\n\"Kate. Please. Please. I didn't do it. Please say you believe me.\"\n\n\"I believe you.\" I truly did.\n\nWith an urgent tone, he said he needed a favor. His mother could not receive collect calls from the jail and he wanted me to three-way her so he could speak to her.\n\nI quickly did so, and his mother picked up.\n\n\"Mom?\"\n\nShe immediately broke down crying. It was a hard conversation to hear.\n\nFor the next couple of weeks, Ryan would call every few days and I would three way his mother so he could speak to her. I didn't believe he killed that man. It wasn't possible, my mind could not fathom Ryan being capable of something like that. He was troubled, sure, but sweet natured. He was a kid for goodness sake. We both were.\n\nI didnt talk in detail with him about the events of that night. I just knew he didnt do it. But I had a lot of unanswered questions.\n\nThe victim was his neighbor. An older man. The details of that summer night depend on which news article you read. Either way, Ryan and a friend of his, that I didn't personally know, had been arrested for beating his neighbor unconscious, stealing his money, then setting his trailer on fire.\n\nI was convinced Ryan did nothing other than being guilty by association. I believed his friend, two years older than him, was the real offender, and Ryan got caught up in the mess.\n\nI come home one day and my mom meets me at the door, stone faced, arms crossed.\n\n\"I don't know who keeps calling from Smith County Jail, but you better put an end to it and immediately\".\n\nI spoke with Ryan once more and told him what my mother had said. He didn't call again.\n\nI was mostly heart broken, but also somewhat relieved. At that age, my biggest concern was what I was gonna wear to school that day, or how much trouble I was going to be in for getting a C on my report card. I didn't have a clue how to deal with having a friend in jail, and in jail for murder, no less.\n\nI grew up, moved on. I was distracted by friends, new love interests, and life. Over the years, I all but forgot about those early teenage years I shared with Ryan.\n\nHe would cross my mind periodically. I would wonder how he was doing. But we didn't speak.\n\nThe year I graduated high school the case finally went to trial. His friend was offered a plea deal to testify against him. Ryan plead guilty by reason of insanity. As I was walking across the stage to accept my diploma, he was handed down a sentence of life without the possibility of parole.\n\nI could no longer naively believe he was innocent. Ryan said in court that he was under the influence of heavy narcotics. He didn't try to deny his involvement, but I can't help but wonder how much his \"plea dealt partner\" pawned off on him. It doesn't matter, the law is clear. A death resulted during the act of robbery and arson. He is guilty of murder regardless of how many blows he administered, or matches he struck.\n\nFour more years passed, I had been in and out of college. Working various places, often two or more jobs at a time supporting myself out on my own. I gave up on nursing school, dropped out, and pursued my true life long dream: law enforcement.\n\nI graduated the police academy at 23 and took to patrolling the streets. I built a successful career, and love my job. Most days.\n\nSome days are really hard, and feels like the failures of society rest heavily on the shoulders of mine and fellow officers. A dark cloud that follows you around reminding you that you can't always make the difference you believed you'd be able to as a fresh faced naive rookie.\n\nI'm coming up on my sixth anniversary of being a police officer. This time period of my career has opened my eyes to a different kind of ugly reality. The 18 year olds I am arresting now, I find, are frequently the individuals I was listing as victims on my child abuse reports five years ago. There's no debating the negative effects childhood abuse has on a person. And Ryan suffered more abuse at the hands of his father, neglect from his mother, than anyone probably knows. I later found out how truly horrific his home life was. When a five year old tries to commit suicide, the severity of lifelong abuse doesn't get much clearer than that. He spent time in foster care, but ultimately ended back up with his mother.\n\nI feel for the victim's family. I truly do. There is nothing more reprehensible that one person violently taking the life of another. However, controversial as it may seem, I can't help but wonder to myself: Where the hell is the justice for Ryan? I'm not making excuses for his actions,  but the events of that day happened due to a perfect storm created by multiple people. Multiple people that failed him. 14 years old. At 14 my thoughts and feelings were limited to that exact moment. There was no fore thought of the future in my small world. Add chemical drugs to the still developing mind of a 14 year old, and well, here we are.\n\nHe will never drive a car, own a smart phone, buy a house, come home from a long day of work to a loving wife. He will never live. His life ended before most of us even got our first kiss.\n\nLiz and I are still best friends and talk almost every day. She recently sent me a news article of Ryan and an appeal of his case that made it all the way to the Supreme Court.\n\n\"Remember him?!\" she said.\n\nYea. I remember.\n\nIn all these years, I never considered reaching out to him. Especially now, he's been in prison almost as long as he's been out. It was such a long time ago. But he was on my mind, so I sat down and wrote a letter, unsure of any intentions of even sending it. I finished it, laid it to the side, and would stop to stare at it lying on my kitchen table for the next few days when I'd walk by.\n\nOh what the hell. Why not. I sealed it in an envelope and dropped it in the out going mailbox at the post office.\n\nIn part, I wrote:\n\n*\"As a police officer, it is my job to hold people accountable for their actions, their crimes; however it is never my job to judge. Even though I was unable to appreciate it then, I am thankful for the fleeting time you were part of my life. It has helped me now to always remember there is so much more to a person than the mistakes they make or crimes they commit. A person is not defined by one single event. It is so easy to see a murderer on the news, label them as evil, to want them to be locked up and then throw away the key. Maybe sometimes they should, maybe not. From knowing you I learned that its just not that black and white. I can't change the past, but I can keep these lessons you unknowingly taught me in mind as I work every day doing what little I can to make a difference.\"*\n\nTo the troubled teens, the \"Ryans\", I listen more intently, look for the warning signs, and go the extra mile to try and be a calm in their storm. Maybe, just maybe for them, that will make all the difference in the world. **After all, at the end of the day knowing someone cares is the most reassuring thing.**\n\n\nUPDATE\n\nSeveral requested to know if/when \"Ryan\" wrote me back. I thought I would include an update with some excerpts from his response below. This isnt the whole chronological letter, just some things I picked to share.\n\n\"Hey, you really surprised me after all this time contacting me. I haven't seen or spoken to a lot of people the past 13 years. It usually happens like this though. Someone writes, and I remember them, but just like they show up, they disappear.\"\n\n\n\"I remember 'Liz' as well. I think I tackled 'Max' one day because he was trying to beat her up. I never forgot about those times. I remember [girl name] breaking up with me for calling you and asking for advice because she was acting strange. You were the advisor for me then.\"\n\n\"I use to be so happy when you accepted my calls when they first locked me up. I was so scared and felt so alone all the time.\" \n\n\"...but seriously Kate, I hate to relive those memories. Rehashing all these terrible things people have said and the trouble I have trying to remember what the truth is, is a gut wrenching process\".\n\n\"Anyways, like you said everything is not all 'black and white' and most of the journalists, columnist, and editors have never met me. You on the other hand, have. You've seen who I was, and hopefully you'll get to see who I am now.\"\n\n\n\"I went through hell in that detention center for two years and three months battling my teenage years from behind walls and razor wire. Hearing bits and pieces of what was being said about me from other kids coming in. The infamy of being charged with capital murder is destructive to a teenager. I grew up with not only kids but adults treating me like a monster. My only comfort came from God\"\n\n\"I was more than broken hearted. No one talked to me much anymore, my family rarely wrote letters or came to see me. I was more than ready for Jesus to love me, because no one else would.\"\n\n\n\"From that day forward I approached my life, my thinking, and my responses to things differently. People still judge me, they always will. But thank God they didn't write the bible with their morals and principals. I would be doomed, and truth be told, them too.\"\n\n\"I found true freedom and peace inside concrete walls and a system that dooms you to fail.\"\n\n\"I have lived 13 years going uphill, being pushed down along the way but still striving to be better and not bitter. Everything I have has been taken away from me numerous times but my circumstances rarely control how I feel. God has stood by my side and done amazing things in my life. I'm truly blessed, beyond measure.\"\n\n\"I never stood still since I have been locked up. I've learned so many new things, I'll sum it up for you: basketball, volleyball, welding, writing, poetry, wood work, hand ball, ping pong, drawing, electrical, maintenance....\"\n\n\"Seriously, I don't think I've written two letters this year. It feels good to. I appreciate you writing me, it means more than you know. Keep me in your prayers, hopefully I'll hear back from you soon.\"\n\n",

        "text": "During my early 20's, while I was more hotblooded and stupid than I am now, one of my first semi \"real\" jobs was working security at a strip club.  This was years before I realized that law enforcement might be a career path for me.  I never would've guessed that I'd end up working for a police department.\n\nMy coworkers mostly consisted of a bunch of guys just like me, who loved to fight almost as much as they loved the girls.  Unfortunately, I almost got into some trouble because of my temper.\n\nIt was about three in the afternoon and I was making my rounds, keeping an eye on the patrons and the entertainers strewn about the floor.  On the main stage, Lyla was doing her thing, gyrating around the pole and taking her bra off.\n\nSuddenly, a blur of movement caught my eye.  I turned and saw a drunken patron clambering up onto the stage and staggering towards Lyla.  I began sprinting toward the stage while radioing others for help.\n\nWe snatched up Mr. Grabby-Grabby and dragged him outside, all the while he swore up and down that Lyla was making eyes at him, she wanted him, yadda yadda.  Once we reached the door, we pushed him out where he tumbled and fell onto the sidewalk, dazed.\n\nI turned to the guys that'd helped me and told them I could handle it from here.  They returned inside and I took up a post in front of the door, barring him from re-entry.\n\nSlowly, yet deliberately, the intoxicated man repeatedly protested his newfound situation, first pleading, then threatening me to return him to Lyla.  Nope. Nope. Nope.  I'm not a very big guy (about 5'10,\" 160lbs) but this guy was even smaller and had imbibed far too much to really handle himself properly.  My brain took none of this into account.\n\nJust as I was considering whether or not to physically encourage him to leave the area, the club's general manager, Mr. Green, came out to have a smoke.  Damn.  I don't wanna get in trouble.\n\nAs Mr. Green silently looked on, the drunken man pulled his phone from his pocket and began recording me, all the while hurling more verbal abuse.  Unsure of what to do, I turned to Mr. Green.\n\n\"Sir, permission to hit him?\"\n\"No.\"\n\nDammit.\n\nAs the man (and his rancid breath) staggered closer and closer, he pushed his phone right up to my face, inches away.  Instinctively, I smacked the phone out of his hands.  It clattered to the concrete so hard the case popped off and battery flew out.\n\n\"HEY!\" Mr. Green looked at me incredulously.  I threw up my hands in protest.  \"I didn't hit him!\"\n\nMr. Green eyed me for a moment and took a drag from his cigarette, then shrugged as if to say \"Hm.  Fair enough.\"\n\nThe drunk stared at the pieces of his phone, then at me, and with a garbled attempt at a war-cry, threw a wild haymaker at me.\n\nI threw up my arm instictively, felt his arm connect, then promptly slugged him across his jaw.  The featherweight crumpled to the ground.\n\n\"HEY!!!\" Mr. Green's eyes were bulging.  I panicked.  \"It was self defense!!\"  He sighed and rubbed his temple.\n\nWhoop whoop whoop!  Just then, a passing police cruiser screeched to a halt, having seen only the tail-end of the altercation.  Two police officers hopped out and started beelining towards me.  \"Hey you!\" said the first one, \"Get over here NOW!\"\n\nMr. Green stepped between me and the approaching cops.  \"Get inside the club.\"\n\nI did as Mr. Green said.  To this day, I'm still not sure if that was the right choice.\n\nI'd heard rumors from other older employees at the club that Mr. Green was a powerful man, with connections to the police department's upper brass.  This was the moment of truth.  I thought I was done.  I'm gonna go to jail.\n\nHeart racing, I peered through one of the tinted windows of the club to see what was happening.  The drunk was motionless and the cops were seething, pointing at the door I was hiding behind as Mr. Green calmly spoke to them.\n\nThe next thing I knew, Mr. Green was lighting a new cigarette and laughing it up with the cops, chattering happily with them about who-knows-what.  I was in shock.  The rumors were true!\n\nWith a firm handshake each, Mr. Green waved off the cops and they started back to their patrol car just as the belligerent drunk began to regain consciousness.\n\nIncredibly, and much to my amusement, he picked up the pieces of his phone, reassembled it, turned it back on-- then staggered up to the cops, recording them and screaming obscenities.\n\nHe pushed his phone right up to one of the cop's face.  The cop glanced at his partner-- then smacked the phone out of his hand.\n\nOnce again, the phone shattered into pieces, and once again, the man howled and threw a wild haymaker.  The cops took him down, cuffed him up and shoved him into the back of the patrol car before speeding off.  I was overwhelmed.  What. Just. Happened??\n\nMr. Green flipped his half-finished cigarette into the street and strolled back inside where I was standing, mouth agape.  As he glided past, he casually turned to me.\n\n\"I think Vanessa is leaving soon.  Can you escort her to her car?\"\n\n\"Yes sir.\"",

        "text": "*This is a story that was told to me by one of my friends in law enforcement.  It happened while he was on duty about six years ago.  This is also my first entry here, but if you guys enjoy it I have more to share!*\n\n*Update: Wow!  I'm so glad you guys enjoyed this!  Thank you!*\n\nA rookie and his FTO on patrol at a local mall responded to a call I can't remember at the moment (doesn't matter because it's not relevant to the story).  It was about 4PM and the area was packed with people milling about.\n\nAt some point, they locate a suspect who takes off, so the rookie and his FTO pursue him on foot, calling in their location/direction of travel to dispatch.\n\nThe suspect tore straight through the mall, knocking over shoppers and stands, both officers hot on his trail.  He exited the rear of the mall and sprinted across the street into another shopping center, yanking a knife from his waistband as he kept running past bewildered bystanders.\n\nThe FTO, still running, un-holstered his service weapon.  The rookie tried to follow suit-- and shot his FTO once in the leg.  They both stopped running and the suspect continued to flee.\n\nThe FTO looked down at his bleeding calf and growled at the rookie \"What are you waiting for?  Call it in!\"\n\nFrazzled, the rookie fumbled briefly for his mic, keyed it up and stated in a dull monotone: \"Shots fired. Officer down at 123 4th Street.\"\n\nAlmost immediately, sirens were heard everywhere.  What seemed like every law enforcement officer arrived in a cacophony of guns and yelling.  Plainclothes units arrived.  Off-duty officers.  Marked and unmarked units.  An FBI field office was nearby; agents swarmed in.  Some SWAT members that'd just finished training plowed onto the scene.  \n\nAll of this took place in roughly 3-4 minutes, during which time my friend also arrived in time to see the FTO, sitting on the ground, rubbing his temples in anger and his rookie standing haplessly beside him.\n\nThe suspect, overwhelmed by the response he thought was for him, gave himself up.  The rookie got torn a new asshole and, miraculously, was reassigned elsewhere.  He still hasn't lived it down to this day.",

        "text": "First post here and this tale is less than happy.\n\nSo here I sit at day 15 of my 28 days on the cocktail. For those that arent in the know this is the Post Exposure Prophylaxis, a blast of anti retroviral meds to stave off HIV transmission.\nAs usual the cart is before the horse, so to the day in question.\n\nJust got back from 2 lovely weeks of annual leave in the summer (seniority has it's privileges) and almost settled in to nightshift. It was 2100 and change and my shiftmates were on board to allow me an easy night of clearing off emails and other workflow.\n\nCall the first: Domestic between parental units over methods of discipline on naughty child. Looking at the call, it had cooled and there was a request to cancel. 'Spatch can't cancel a domestic so I volunteer to go alone. Plan: do a doorknock and then ride that call while I grab my coffee.\n\nDo a quick recce and see the lovely couple happily doing dishes together. Doorknock. Quick chat. Parting words. Head for coffee.\n\nHaven't quite dropped the skate in park and the call goes out over the air.\n\n\"Two units for *shitty address in L4NT14N's zone* reports of female smashing windows in the building. Now on foot hitting passing cars\"\n\nI pipe up and book it. Coffee shop was fairly close so I beat my backing unit there. By a long shot. Multiple callers flagging me towards the tiniest female suspect ever. \n\nI pop out pull my dad voice out and give her a stern \"Hey!\". Limited effect. I then notice the 3 foot metal bar in her hand which she is lazily swinging around.\n\nPerfect.\n\nPull my Taser, clip my mic and yell drop the weapon, nice and loud so I wake dispatch up, then calmly ask for radio silence.\n\nEngage de-escalation techniques. \n\nMe: \"Miss put down the weapon you are under arrest.\"\n\nHer: \"No I'm not.\"\n\nSo I now know I am dealing with an advanced form of suspect.\n\nEngage **advanced** de-escalation techniques.\n\nMe: Drop the weapon, turn around and put your hands behind your back or you're getting tased!\n\nHer: \"Nope\"\n\nShe walks away still swinging the bar around her head and body. My taser target is now a backpack roughly the size of her entire body.\n\nI have 2 options running through my head now. Rush her and hope I don't get bopped or walk with, issue commands and play it by ear.\n\nI choose the latter still waiting on backup.\n\nHuzzah back up arrives.\n\nYoung Buck (YB) blows by us. Chucks 'er in \"R\", and pops out with me.\n\n Manage to circle to the other side of her while my partner is engaging her.\n\nI spot my moment and full on tackle the 85 lbs suspect.\n\nIt was a beaut. Takes me back to my old glory days in the backfield.\n\nWe go down. Small piggy pile of 2. Strip the bar away as she turtles and tucks her hands in.\n\nWe gain control and it is now a textbook 2 officer mount and cuffs come out. YB gets her right cuffed. I yank out the left and then, fuck, I felt that.\n\nGet her in an arm bar which reveals 2 dirty needles in her left. Musta grabbed em from her hoodie, or had them the whole time. I don't know I was threat focused on the bar.\n\nI get her to drop the needles, we finish cuffing and by that time there are 8 cruisers on the street. I hand off, roll up my pant leg and see the smallest bright red pearl of blood. \n\nAwesome.\n\nStart the process. Call for a medic, 60 minute wait due to call volume. Fuck it. Drive myself to the hospital.\n\nBlood tests, horse pills and condoms with the wife for the first time in the better part of a decade. \n\nSome of the lovely side effects of the cocktail are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and liver damage.\n\nIn Ontario we have the Mandatory Blood Testing act. It covers hospital staff and first responders in the case of contact with a potential bloodborne pathogen.\n\nAllows blood to be drawn (voluntarily or with warrant) from a known source.\n\nShe eventually consents, but I already know her history so no point in taking chances.\n\nI have more bloodwork to go and am awaiting an all clear at the 6 week mark before going back to work.\n\nI miss the hell out of pushing a cruiser and am texting and harassing my co workers for details as to what I'm missing. They are not having any of that. Rest up, come back when you are all good.\n\nSilver lining.\n\nI've been to parks all over the area with my kids, farmer's markets with the wife, a festival for the kids and one coming up for the grown-ups. My kids are too young to know why, but they are happy dad is home.\n\nMy wife is really upset, the condoms, the fear of me developing HIV or Hepatitis, my general moodiness and me being sick. However she is quite the trooper and is helping me out a lot.\n\nMoral of the story.\n\nIf there is one it's watch the hands. Even if you are watching the hands watch harder.\n\nTo conclude, shit happens, sometimes it happens to you. Take care of each other and have each other's back. Family is truly what we all are. Thanks for reading.\n\nTL;DR\n\nGot stabbed with a dirty needle. The cocktail sucks.",

If you've worked in a job that's full of lots of down time and a few crazy moments, you know never to say that it's \"quiet\" or \"slow.\" Because you're guaranteed to ruin the day.\n\nWe got a call of a crash on the freeway, only one car. The 9-1-1 operator reported hearing screaming in the background, so they started an ambulance, and myself and 3 other units went en route.\n\nI showed up after the ambulance and found an SUV on its side with a light pole on the ground nearby, a crying woman who's a little bruised, a completely hammered drunk man, and a scared kid. I could tell the man was drunk from 50 feet away. Only one car, so obviously a drunk driving crash.\n\nWell that'd be wrong.\n\nI talk to the woman, who explains she was driving. As she was driving, she was arguing with the man who was in the passenger seat. In his drunken stupor, he decided to punch the driver, and at some point laid hands on the kid. It's a little hard to drive while getting punched, so the woman loses control, spins out, goes through a pole. You know, average day.\n\nBackup showed up. Really, I was backup, so I explained everything to the Trooper handling it and started some paperwork.\n\nWe're still on the shoulder of the freeway while this was happening, with traffic gong about 60 and everyone slowing to see what was going on. I was watching traffic to avoid getting hit, and I saw an Accord going 30mph in the middle lane, while everyone around was doing double that. He seemed to be extra interested in the crash, and I expected he'd cause one.\n\nI was right. While watching the Accord, I heard screeching tires. I glanced right behind the Accord and watched an old Oldsmobile become one with the Accord. The Oldsmobile plowed into the Accord with enough force to deploy all the airbags the Oldsmobile had.\n\nTraffic slowed for that crash, now blocking the middle lanes. I let the rest of the officers deal with the original felony domestic violence/child endangerment  case, and walked into the lanes to check on this new crash.\n\nEveryone was fine (hooray seat belts and airbags). I handled everything at that scene so the other Trooper could deal with his ridiculous scene.\n\nIt's never been \"slow\" since then.",

We were on the fifth defendant at First Appearance, the aptly named court session that was a defendant's first hearing after an arrest.  \n  \nI was a bailiff providing security for the courtroom.  Each defendant was live from the county jail on a big television at the front of the courtroom.  I had just realized the futility of my job when the public defense attorney, John, turned to me and laughed.  \n  \nI had just met him today.  He was a really nice person that just seemed like he loved meeting people.  Throughout the session he had been explaining to me how First Appearance worked.  \n\nWhile we were waiting for the jail to put the next person in front of the camera, John spoke.  \"I hope nobody is a huge idiot today.\"  \n  \nI laughed in reply.  \"If that was true, we'd both be out of a job.\"  I saw John roll his eyes and mouth \"shit\" as the next person came on the screen.  \n\nOur defendant immediately started talking.  \"Your honor I just want to ask...\"  The Judge didn't let him finish.  \n\n\"Let me explain something to you, son.\"  The Judge started.  \"This is First Appearance.  There is no judgement and this is not a trial.  This is just an explanation of what you are going to expect for the next few weeks, as well as the setting of your bond.  However, anything you say here is being recorded and can be used against you in trial.  Do you understand that?\"  \n  \n\"Yes, sir, but...\"  Now John interrupted him.  \n  \n\"Sir, my name is John and I'm temporarily representing you for today.  I highly recommend you do not talk whatsoever.\"  \n  \nThe defendant finally gave it a rest while the judge reviewed the charges.  \"Your charges today are for violation of injunction.  I'll set your bond to be $1000.  Does the state have an objection?\"  \n  \nThe representative for the state stood up, but wasn't able to get a word out before the defendant piped up again.  \"Your honor...\"  \n  \nThe state then looked directly at the screen and, if the horse wasn't dead already, also nicely reminded the person to shut the hell up.   \n  \n\"State agrees, your honor\"  \n  \n\"Defense argues for a lesser bond, considering that this is a first time offense that was non-violent, your honor,\" John addressed the Judge.  \"I would suggest $500.\"  \n  \n\"The state would disagree.  $1000 has always been the standard for a violation of injunction,\" the State replied.  \n  \nThe Judge made his decision.  \"The bond will be set at $1000, considering that's the standard.  I see your application for a Public Defender.  One will be assigned to you.  We'll be in contact for your court date.\"  \n  \n\"YOUR HONOR, I just have one question sir,\" the defendant insisted.  \n  \nThe Judge sighed, taking his glasses off and looking at the young defendant.  \"You can ask, but remember.  This is recorded and can be used against you.\"  \n  \n\"Okay, thank you sir.  How can I get my stuff from her house? That's the only reason I went over there.\"  \n  \nThe collective sigh from the courtroom must have been audible to the next town over.  John turned back to me and whispered \"See the shit I have to deal with?\"",

Thank God he was respectful and easy to deal with  (or at least he was to be now he was after all in prison for aggravated robbery) he was park of our Christian wing program KIROS I think they call it...

Not the usual old lady hearing a tapping sound outside her window call for that area. \n\nI arrive on scene just as my back up arrived. We exit our vehicles and approach together to make contact. First thing I hear is: \"What the f*** are they doing here!?\" Great start to any call.

        "text": "\"Alpha 1, shooting in progress\"\n\nDang it, another one? In my city, \"petty crime\" was the usual. Thefts, domestics arguments. This was the third shooting in a little over a week!\n\nI was the 3rd or 4th officer to arrive at the motel. I walk around the corner and see an officer standing next to a black male who was sitting, leaned against the wall, and was apparently in distress. The offenders had fled the scene prior to our arrival in two different vehicles.\n\nI walk over to the officer, who looks at me and says \"They used a shot gun\"\n\n*\"Really?\"* I said. Looking down at the victim I made a quick assessment of his wounds, *\"Ohhh, bird shot\".*\n\n\"Yup\", said my partner.\n\n*\"Well, that's good.\"*\n\nThe injured man, breathing heavy and rapidly, yells, \"WHAT!?\" in response to my statement.\n\nRealizing the way it sounded, I crouched down and said, \"I'm sorry, what I meant is it's good considering the alternative. Look at me, look at me. You're going to be alright, ok?\"\n\n(Alternative being buck shot, which likely would have left a gaping hole the size of a melon in his body)\n\nGranted, I'm no doctor, but I could clearly see where he has been struck by the pellets, and all but 3 missed him completely. The three tiny wounds he did have were in his upper arm. He was panicking, and rightfully so, but he was going to be okay. Regardless, I comforted him as much as possible until the medics arrived.\n\nIt doesn't matter how many shootings you work, the scene is always a hectic chaotic mess. I assigned myself to getting witness statements.\n\nThis particular scene was made even more difficult by the three drunk people next door who witnessed the shooting. Two loud obnoxious intoxicated males and one annoying intoxicated female. Who repeatedly during questioning felt the need to tell us that they were there to have a threesome. They were so drunk they kept forgetting they told us, and would tell us again a few minutes later.\n\n*\"So, what happened right before you heard the shots?\"*\n\n \"Welll offffisherrr, I'll be honest, okayyy? Only reason we were even here is cuzzz... you know... we were gunna.... ya know, have a threesome.\"\n\n*\"Yes. I am aware. And I don't care any more now than I did when you told me that five minutes ago.\"*\n\nAfter weeding through the slurred speech, we pieced together what we think might have happened.\n\nTwo car loads of 8-10 black males pull up in two vehicles. I don't know what or who they were looking for, but one of the \"three some\" white males spats off at them and they engage in a verbal back and forth argument. White guy gets scared, I assume, and knocks on his neighbors door. Neighbor opens the door and white guy begs him to come outside, because there are a bunch of guys trying to jump him. Neighbor doesn't want anything to do with the nonsense and turns around to go back in his room, just in time for the trigger of the shot gun to be pulled. \n\nAll of the pellets miss the white guy completely, and almost missed the innocent by standing neighbor who was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Three of the pellets struck him in the right shoulder as he was turning to go back inside. We speculate that racial slurs may have contributed to escalating the fight.\n\nIt was the most random thing ever. \n\nAnd then it gets weirder.\n\nI'm standing outside of a random room near the shooting talking to a rookie. All of the sudden we hear, \"knock knock, knock, knock, knock knock\"\n\nWe look at the motel room door behind us, then back at each other, both of us confused as hell as to why someone is knocking on the door from the INSIDE of their room. \n\n*\"What the hell?? Like... do we answer it? Say come in?...or come out?\"*\n\nStill standing there perplexed, the door creaks opens about two inches. I see a dark silhouette and one eye peering out through the crack.\n\n\"Excuse me\", a deep gravelly voice says, \"don't you wanna know what I saw?\"\n\n*\"Uhhhh.... sure.\"*\n\n\"Okay\", the man says closing the door then quickly cracking it open again. \"Should I put pants on first?\"\n\n*\"Umm, yeah, sure, that'd be great\".*\n\nTurns out, this guy didn't see jack crap. He took up five minutes of our time just to explain the \"pop, pop pop pop\" sounds he heard. He didn't exactly seem like he was working with all his mental faculties.\n\nA couple of hours later, I head to the hospital to check on our victim and gather his clothes as evidence. I walk in the room and he smiles.\n\n *\"Hey there, remember me?\"* He nods his head.\n\nI pull his nurse to the side and request to know his status. She replies, \"Oh he's going to be fine. We're actually getting ready to discharge him\".\n\n The victim and I chat back and forth and I get his side of the story. I felt so bad for him. He was simply traveling for business, and was literally an innocent by stander who had no part in the argument that lead up to the shooting. \n\n\"Getting ready to release him\" isn't a quick process I have learned. I needed to leave, but gave him the number to the police department and told him to call when he was released and we would give him a ride back to his motel. He rode in the ambulance so he didn't have his car, and wasn't from the area so he knew no one locally who could give him a lift. I figured it was the least we could do considering the horrific night that had fallen in his lap.\n\n\nFast forward to 6 weeks later.......\n\nI respond to the same motel for an \"unknown trouble\" type call. While enroute, the details I am updated with lead me to believe the caller is crazy. The caller apparently needs police because he is hearing voices through his T.V. and air conditioner. The voices are two males talking about how he (the caller) knows too much and that they need to \"take care of him\". Also, between the voices the air conditioner intermittently plays \"hippie music\".\n\nI get there, knock on the door, but no one will answer. I tell Dispatch to call them back and advise the complainant to come to the door.\n\nDispatch responds, \"10-4\" the caller requests that you knock exactly 6 times so he knows it's really the police\".\n\nWhat the...? Whatever, I play along with his madness and knock exactly 6 times.\n\nA disheveled terrified man opens the door wearing nothing but thin boxer briefs.\n\n\"You gotta come in and listen to this!!\" He points up and whispers, \"I think it's themmmm\".\n\n*\"The people upstairs?\"* I whisper back.\n\n\"Yeah, actually it migh-----\" He breaks mid sentence, \"Should I put pants on??\"\n\nI stare back at him blinking, realizing it's the same pant-less loony toon from weeks before.\n\n*\"Ya know what, screw it. It's fine. I'm okay with it if you are.\"*\n\nHe was okay with it.\n\n\n",

        "text": "(Disclaimer: Do not read if the content described by the title is going to resurface negative emotions from personal experiences. But for anyone thinking about becoming an officer, this is one of the ugly parts of policing that no one warns you about.)\n\nI was literally sitting at a gas station across the street from the address Dispatch was sending me to. I could have thrown a rock and hit the house I was so close to it. \"Caller advised husband has shot himself\"\n\nI had been released for solo duty that July. It was November, a few days before Thanksgiving. I was 23 years old and all kinds of an inexperienced rookie. I drive across the street and jump out, gun drawn. I didn't know if this guy was dead or not. And if he wasn't, suicide by cop may have been on his mind. All I knew for sure was a man had a gun, so I'm going to have mine too.\n\nThe front door was propped open. Sitting on the edge of the couch was a middle aged woman. Screaming doesn't adequately describe what she was doing. It was a yell distinctly different than any I had heard before. It was a gut wrenching, deep, projecting, agonizing scream. \n\nThis is part of where I think police can portray a cold and indifferent image that regular citizens can't and don't understand. The human me wanted nothing more than to wrap my arms around her and provide some ineffecacious form of comfort. The police in me knew there was no time for that. I had an unknown situation, a man with a gun, and a gun shot wound, a potential threat, or someone in need of immediate medical care.\n\n\"Where is he?\" \n\nShe babbled something and pointed up the stairs. I tactically began clearing the few rooms until there was only one left. I take half steps to the side clearing as much as the room as possible before making entry. Before I was able to walk in, I saw him. From where I stood, it looked like he was sleeping. My adrenaline had caused me to have auditory exclusion. I couldn't hear the screams anymore.\n\nUp until then, I had been sure of what I needed to do. Or thought I did. I stood at the door looking at this man laying in bed and my mind went blank. I had no clue what to do next. I stood and stared for what felt like several minutes, but in reality was a short few seconds. \n\n\"Police, let me see your hands!\" \n\n*idiot,* I think to myself *I can see both his hands*\n\nI move in slowly, inching tiny steps closer. Gun in one hand, I use my other to reach for the hand of his closest to me intending to check his pulse. I take a quick glance at his face scanning for any change, or sign he is waking up, and immediately jump back holstering as I quickly back out of the room. \n\n\"Code 3 for medics\" \n\nAs a seasoned officer, now, I realize what I should of said was, \"Patient priority 0, medics can respond code 1\". Meaning 'No need to rush. Patient is beyond resuscitation\".\n\nMy victim had shot himself in his temple with a .357 magnum. Aside from saying only half of his skull was left, I will spare the rest of the details.\n\nI had been on scene for two, maybe three minutes. Felt like forever. I wanted my back up to get there so bad. \n\nFor some reason, I walked back in the room. Rookie mistake. I looked around, scanned the room. The mirror of the bed's headboard looked foggy. I realized it was a mist of blood, from the high velocity gun shot wound. For some reason I can't explain, I even turned my gaze to the ceiling above the bed. It was disturbing.\n\n\nThe smell of death. Sounds so dramatic, but there really is a true distinct smell of death. It's impossible to describe fully. The air is thicker, almost hot; as if all of the heat that has left the body lingers in the room. Its metallic in nature, from the iron in blood. Not necessarily foul, definitely not pleasant, but most certainly, unsettling.\n\nMy back-up walked down the hall to me. He later tells me I was white as a ghost. He takes a peek Inside and I tell him he's \"10-7\". Letting him know there's no need to step further. \n\nAs the medics arrive, my adrenaline subsides, my hearing returns and I make my way back to the screams. I see another officer is with his wife, so I continue outside to get my clip board. And air, fresh air. \n\n\"You alright?\" My lieutenant asks\n\n*Yeah, I'm good.*\n\n\"You sure?\n\n*Yea. Ya know,  it's just....it was pretty cool seeing blood and gore in crime scene photos at the academy. Not so much in real life.*\n\n\"No. It most certainly is not\".\n\nI later told my dad, a 25 year veteran officer, about it. He told me something then that I have always remembered at scenes like that since. \n\n\"When you go to calls like that, look only for as long as you need to, and don't look again.\"\n\nThat advice has saved me from an untold amount of horrible nightmares. Its just like the saying, \"it's like watching a train wreck\" where you can't look away from things. For the sake of your future sanity,  you just have to force yourself to. ",

        "text": "You all probably know that PTS isn't unusual in this line of work. Heck, everyone in law enforcement has various degrees of brushing with it. So I'm sitting here after a very long shift, trying to figure out if I should chalk this under being tired or \"shit that I wouldn't tell anyone, thanks Internet for letting me vent this out anonymously.\"\n\nLast month I took an inmate to hospital for a cat scan. Our facility isn't that well equipped, the sick bay is three cells, a nurse post, an x-ray machine and a visiting doctor. Anyway, inmate Greenleaf (not his real name) had a long history of being in love with meth in its various incarnations, and somehow managed to keep this hobby alive in prison just as well. He was also medicated for reasons real or fake, but hey, I'm no doctor so I can't really say. That particular day Greenleaf was aloof, kind of all over the place and very very cold. He had missed his medication round because of the hospital trip and sometimes he'd be coherent, but mostly not. The night before, he \"fell off his bunk\" and \"hit his head\" on the floor while \"none of the other inmates saw anything\", prompting us to get him checked as soon as there were enough of us for a visit to the nearest medical imaging centre. \n\nAs we were waiting for our turn to the CT, the nurse showed up with some T3 and those dreaded pre-dye 12oz cups, then used her magic and convinced Greenleaf to down them slowly, over the span of an hour. Greenleaf obliged, but the dye is a nasty business and by the end of the second cup he was already retching, obviously having trouble keeping all that stuff in. Mrs. Happy Nurse popped in again, hooking Greenleaf to a PVC (intravenous catheter) and away we went to the CT room, where the tech promptly shoved a clipboard and a pen under his nose. \n\n\"What's this, CO?\" he grumbled to me. I took a look.\n\n\"It's the self assessment and [consent form](http://www.nyrp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ct-forms-packet.pdf) you gotta sign before they shove you into that big magnet over there\", I said. \"You know, basically tell them that you ain't got no metal in your body and waiving them any responsibility in case you die.\" \n\n\"Die?\" \n\n\"Well read on the bottom\", I pointed out. \"You can die from dye. It says right there. You gotta agree to having dye put in your system, if you want any of this to actually work.\"\n\n\"Dye from die. Huh. You're not funny CO.\"\n\n\"I'm not trying to be, Greenleaf. You can refuse and we all go back where we came from, or you can have it and they'll be able to tell what that stomping did to your noggin. Your call.\"\n\n\"There wasn't any stompin' CO, already told you that. Aah fuck it, I'll take the scan or whatever. Reckon it's nothing, I've had worse shit put inna me veins.\" Then he leaned on a side and vomited a bit in the garbage bin next to him.\n\n\"Greenleaf, are you sure? I can't decide for you but if you're not feeling well then maybe-\"\n\n\"-Nah CO\", he cut me, \"I'm good. I'm good, let's do it.\"\n\nAnd with this, Greenleaf signed the waiver and in we went. I sat with the techs behind the control post and watched two huge pistons, one orange and one blue, slowly pumping the contrast goop in Greenleaf's blood. Then we took him out of the CT room, he sat in the same chair, vomited again in the garbage bin, and finally my relief arrived. Later in the evening, they hauled him back to the prison.\n\nThe next day, they found Greenleaf on the floor in his cell, unresponsive. One CPR hour later, I was riding with him in the ambulance, while in the back four paramedics were taking turns doing chest compressions and basically doing every known possible procedure on him. And finally at the hospital, his candle went out and he was pronounced dead right there, in front of me and my partner. Overdose, they later said. He had OD'd on whatever he could lay his hands on that night and later, there were accounts that he begged everyone in the pod for some \"stuff\". Also that his buddies obliged, because he felt really sick and they were trying to help him. Yeah right. \n\nFast forward to present day. I'm at the same hospital with another officer, taking an inmate for a CT scan. Deja-vu, right? Right. Partner goes in CT room, I am staying outside to cover the exit. I can hear a faint humming as the machinery in the room sucks power and looks through the mope laying on the stretcher, but there's something else too.\n\n\"Die from dye, huh, CO? Here you go, I'm dead. How do you like your joke NOW?\" goes a raspy voice in my ear.\n\nIt's dark in the hallway. I look over my shoulder, there's Greenleaf sitting in the same chair by the garbage bin, shaking his head. I do a double take, and Greenleaf's gone, but I can make his voice, fainter like he would be walking away: \"Die from dye. Heh. Not funny, CO. Noooot funny.\"\n\n(*EDITED* for grammar and clarity)",

        "text": "I was driving on the northbound side of the freeway when I saw a car broken down on the southbound side, parked on the right shoulder. It was an old sedan, with more duct tape holding it together than welds. I could see that there was no one in it, so I turned around to tag it to get towed.\n\nI pulled up behind it and saw the registration on the plate was current. I went to look inside, and found it was full of a lot of junk. Whoever owned it rarely ever cleaned it. As I was looking inside, I saw a man about 500 feet away walking back towards me, gas container in hand. Good, he'd fill it up and be back on his way. He waved to me and I waved to him.\n\nAs I finished looking at what was in the car, I took a look at the ignition. It's a habit since stolen cars tend to have punched ignitions. Lo and behold, this one had a punched ignition with a screwdriver as a key. Hmm.\n\n\"Dispatch, this is Unit 2, I need a stolen vehicle check. And start me a second unit.\"\n\nPause. Pause. Man keeps walking closer. He's smiling, with his gas can in hand. Pause. As he got closer, I could see he had a tape measure clipped to his pants. Come on, dispatch! The result of that stolen vehicle check is the difference between me saying, \"How ya doin?\" and me having my gun out saying, \"Get on the ground!\"\n\n\"Unit 2, dispatch, I copy your registration check and request for a second unit. Go ahead with the plate.\"\n\nI ran the plate, and the second unit went en route. Right as I finished, the guy reached me. Still no idea if this car was stolen. The area I work in has thousands of vehicles stolen a year, so there was a good chance it would be stolen.\n\nThe greeting I went with: \"How ya doin, sir?\"\n\n\"I'm alright, officer.\"\n\n\"You run out of gas?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I just got back from the station. It should be good once I fill it up.\"\n\n\"Where were you headed?\"\n\n\"I was gonna do some construction in Springfield.\" He gestured to his tape measure.\n\nDispatch came back, finally. \"Unit 2, that is returning not stolen, with a registration that expired two years ago.\" Funny, since the sticker on the license plate said it was still valid. You can go to jail for that, and your car can get impounded.\n\n\"Sir, do you have a driver's license?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\" Another thing to go to jail for. Although I never actually saw him driving. Where I work, only 1 in 4 people driving has a license anyway.\n\n\"What about an ID?\"\n\n\"No, nothing.\" Red flag. Normal people carry ID's, at the very least to prove they're 18 getting into rated R movies, or give verification for a credit card purchase. People who don't carry ID's don't want to be identified. I had him write down his name and date of birth, and requested an address.\n\n\"What city do you live in?\"\n\nHe pointed to the car. \"Right here.\"\n\n\"I, uh, what?\"\n\nHe pointed to the car again. \"I'm homeless, this is where I live.\"\n\nOkay, not rare. But even homeless people had an address at some point. He stated he lived in a nearby city a few years ago, but never had an ID or a driver's license.\n\n\"So it's your car. Do you have a key for it?\"\n\n\"Oh yeah.\" He pulled out a key and used it to open the trunk, showing it worked.\n\n\"So what's with the screwdriver in the ignition?\"\n\n\"The car got stolen and recovered, and they broke the ignition, and I couldn't afford a new one. So I just use a screwdriver now.\" I guess if it's stupid but it works, it isn't stupid.\n\nHe asked, \"Can I pour the gas in?\"\n\n\"No...not yet. Just leave the gas can on the car, take a seat in the car, and wait.\"\n\nHe does so. I run some things on the computer in my car to try and ID the guy. Found him, and he had a driver's license...15 years prior. I was able to pull up the picture to show it was him. He also had a prior conviction for burglary, which tends to happen when you don't have any money. But he didn't have any warrants, so he's mostly been keeping out of trouble.\n\nI went back up to him because the car was still bugging me. \"You said this was your car, but it doesn't return to your name. Do you have anything showing it's yours?\" He was able to pull out some old paperwork supporting his story.\n\nPolice have this phrase we like to use: totality of the circumstances. When you make a decision, you need to consider *everything*, not just one thing. My agency directive is also to enforce the spirit of the law, not the letter of the law.\n\nMy options: I arrest this guy for fake registration, driving without a driver's license, give him a ticket for the registration that's two years overdue, and impound his car. I can also do any variation of the above. And as I consider these options, I consider the benefit of what I do. If I do all of the above, where is the good in what I'm doing? The state isn't going to get money since this guy has none. It'd cost taxpayers even more just to hold him in jail. And he's trying to be productive; he's headed to work...probably. At the same time, this car is pretty much his world, and taking it would be like taking everything he has.\n\nI also have to consider the negative consequences of my actions. What if he crashes into someone? My duty isn't to this one person, but everyone.\n\nWith my decision made, I went back up to him. \"Sir, here's what's going to happen. Do you have a cell phone?\" He confirmed he did. \"You're getting a correctable ticket for the registration. You can't legally drive, so you can't drive away from here. You're going to call someone with a valid license to come and pick you and the car up. And if I see you driving again, you're going to jail.\"\n\nHe had a friend come and pick him up. I haven't seen that car since then.",

        "text": "Strangely, Sundays are our craziest days.  Without fail.  \n\nI'm a Sergeant and usually supervise between 6-11 guys and gals.  70-man department in a college town.  Fridays are busy, mostly DUI's and barfights and the like.  Same thing on Saturday.  Busy, but nothing *too crazy.*  That happens on Sunday.\n\nThis Sunday was quiet until about 04:00.  A traffic stop for a simple moving violation resulted in the driver attempting to pull a gun, which resulted in a pursuit, which resulted in an injury collision and a foot pursuit.  Whilst wrapping that up, and immediately upon sitting down to start paperwork, a report of a male cross-dresser masturbating while looking in windows of an apartment complex.  Those two combined got us up to about 06:00...2 hours before the end of shift, and the golden time when we *really* don't want anything to happen.\n\nThe call comes in that a pedestrian saw what he thought was a bloody, naked girl in a tree.  All my guys are doing their reports.  So am I, in fact, but I decide to give them a break and take this one myself.  Probably not legit anyway.  \n\nI arrive on scene and start looking around.  Plenty of trees, mostly conifers.  None with naked girls.  Caller is, of course, nowhere to be found.  Walking back to my car, though, I notice that I don't hear any birds.  I decide to take another look, when I hear some rustling.\n\nThere she is.  Naked as a jaybird.  Probably about 18-19.  I would have seen her, but I *didn't look high enough.*  She was easily 65ft up.  Covered in scratches and blood.\n\nI radioed in to dispatch.  Requested EMS to stage.  Called out to her several times and got no response.  It was pretty apparent that she wasn't currently on the same plane of existence as me.  She had this thousand-yard-stare.  She was stroking the needles and licking the branches.  \n\nMy officers, upon hearing my radio traffic, showed up in force.  They're not gonna miss this.  I position them around the tree so that, in case she tumbles down and survives (quite possible depending on what she's on).  We continue to call out to her, but she doesn't respond.  I radio dispatch and request a ladder truck; I'm gonna have to climb up there and snatch her, I guess. \n\nLadder truck shows up.  Firemen are as entertained as we are.  The fire Captain makes it clear to me that it's gonna have to be *me* that climbs the ladder and grabs her, but he'd be glad to give me a safety harness.  Thanks dude.\n\nAs we're extending the ladder, she starts moving.  First up (oh please no)...then out onto a branch (nonononononoooo).  But then, very methodically and systematically, she starts climbing down.  I motion to my officers to back off, and I move in.\n\nShe reaches the bottom, hops off the last branch, and turns to me.\n\n\"Hi!\" she says.\n\n\"Hello!\"\n\n\"How are you?\"\n\n\"I'm pretty good.  Say, wanna put some clothes on?\"\n\n\"Sure!\"\n\nSo, I cuff her...to make sure she doesn't take off before we can get her help.  I pluck her clothes from nearby tree branches where they apparently fell, and clothe her enough to cover up her...well, important stuff.\n\nI tell EMS to proceed and walk her out from under the tree.  The conversation that follows makes it *abundantly* clear that she's on LSD.  Surprisingly, for a college town, we don't see pure straight LSD much.  But it's a very distinct state of being.\n\nMe:  \"So what were you doing in the tree?\"\n\n\"I thought my soul-mate was up there.\"\n\n\"He's, he's not still up there is he?\"\n\n\"No.  See, but.  You, you wouldn't understand.\"\n\n\"Try me.\"\n\n\"Well, do you know that the opposite of the color gray is?\"\n\n(This actually stumped me.)  \"Ummm...\"\n\n\"See, you can't see it.  It's there.  Think about a mirror.  A reflection.  What's the opposite of that?  Opaque?  No, because that's still a color.  But everything has an opposite, see?  Dichotomy.  Here, let me look at your eyes.  (stares into my soul.)  Your hair is the wrong color, see?  It's not supposed to be that color.  It only appears to be that color because you *think* it should be that color.\"\n\nPure, straight, LSD.  \n\nAs I hear it, she was twice as entertaining in the ER, and blew several minds before finally being all patched up and discharged.",

It's not a surprise to walk outside and see someone pulled over on one of the parallel roads to his. Tonight, as we are stepping out, we see two police vehicles and two officers talking to a younger guy. As we get to my car, about 200 feet away from where the officers are, I put my stuff inside and hear two snaps. My friend gasps and pushes me against my car as the guy runs and the officers are after him, full speed ahead. They come so close we can feel the wind off them as they run. As soon as I look up, one of the officers tazes the suspect, who immediately falls face-first onto the pavement. Moments later, he's back on his feet and takes off as fast as he can through main street, narrowly avoiding getting hit by a truck. \n\nAs we are watching them run down the street, two more police vehicles speed off after them and disappear around the corner. As we walk towards the commotion (There were about 20 other people going home from the bars or playing Pokemon), a bunch of them lean over the giant bridge. He jumped. He didn't die, but he got away. Tazed? No problem for this guy. \n\nThey're still hunting, as this happened just an hour ago. Hoping the best for our police department.",

Dummies. \n\n“10-bravo-charlie, 10-4. He’s in the road, blocking traffic.” The radio was already busy, usually not a good sign.\n\n“Unit near Maple and Beech that can start to back 10-bravo-charlie? The dispatcher asked in her bored tone. \n\nThere was no reply until the supervisor came over the air. \n\n“Charlie-1: I can start but I’ll be a while, heading from the station.” My computer finally booted up and I was able to run a quick status to see where 10-bravo-charlie was. \n\n“10-bravo-charlie. He appears to be under the influence of something, he’s not responding to my commands.” There was an edge to his voice now, and when my computer made the “BING!” indicating a returned message, I saw I wasn’t too far away. Instead of taking my normal route to the office, I figured I’d detour and see what he had. \n\n“10-bravo-charlie! I just tased him! He’s running!”\n\nI flipped on the lights and siren and sped up my response. \n\n“He’s south-bound on Maple, just entered the town house community!” 10-bravo-charlie was already out of breath. I realized I went to the academy with him, though I hadn’t seen him in five-or-so years. “Black male, twenty years old, no shirt, black shorts…” He huffed.\n\nIn minutes, I was in the area and began scanning the streets for the suspect. Several other units had joined me at that point and I checked the GPS map for an open spot on the perimeter. \n\nThe radio was busy with traffic. “K9-bravo, I’m in the area and can start a track. What are the charges?” \n\nMy former classmate, Pat, responded. “He’s disorderly, tried to punch me…” He paused, still a bit out of breath. “And he tried to break into a house while I was in pursuit.”\n\nI made eye contact with an old lady doing some gardening in the small bed in front of her house. The K9 unit continued. “10-4, we can track for the attempted burglary. Give us his last location.”\n\n“Maple and Poplar. I’m standing by here and he ran into the woods to the rear of this row of houses.” Pat said. \n\nThe old lady approached my car and I rolled down the window to greet her. “Everything ok? There are a lot of sirens around here now.”\n\n“Oh, yeah. No problem ma’am. Just had a guy run from an officer after trying to fight him. We’re seeing if he’s still in the area. We should be out of your hair in a few minutes though.” My statement was punctuated by the chopping sound of rotors overhead. \n\n“Air-two, we’re in the area and monitoring K9.” The helicopter must have been having a slow morning. \n\n“So I’ll be safe out here?” The woman asked, fearfully scanning up and down the street. \n\n“I’ll be here to jump on any bad guys that pop up, don’t worry.” I smiled.\n\nShe thanked me and returned to her flower bed. The K9 unit, dog’s nose to the pavement, trotted across the road a ways down from my position followed by a parade of patrol officers. \n\nI leaned back in my seat and turned up the morning sports radio program I usually listened to, happy to fill my role as a link in the chain of the perimeter. \n\nA few minutes passed before K9 came over the air again. “K9-bravo, we’ve hit a dead end, lost the track. Is there anyone available to grab the items the subject was carrying so we can attempt to use them as a scent article?”\n\nI waited several beats, expecting someone eager to get off the perimeter in favor of a potentially more exciting task. No one stepped up. I sighed and grabbed my radio mic. \n\n“Foxtrot-zero-4. I’ll get it. Is it back by 10-bravo-charlie’s original location?”\n\n“10-4, EMR.” Pat said over the radio. “By my cruiser. I think it’s a grocery bag or something.”\n\n“En route.” I replied. I glanced to the woman still tilling the soil to my left. “I’ll be back in a few!”\n\nShe smiled and waved as I pulled off.\n\nI located the bag in short order (contents: an opened box of Newports, empty Steel Reserve tall boy) and collected it with glove so as not to contaminate the scent. I then started for K9’s last position. A mile or so away I found them and flicked the lights of my undercover vehicle on to let them know I was a cop, not another Looky-Loo coming to ask a million questions.\n\nPat greeted me at the window and relieved me of my cargo with a “Thank you.” He passed the bag off to the K9 handler and came back to me. “You mind ferrying me back to my car? It’s hot as balls.” He had sweat rings darkening his uniform shirt and was a bit red in the face still. \n\n“Sure man, hop in.” I cleared off my passenger seat and unlocked the doors. \n\n“Thanks.” He settled in and put on his seatbelt. “Crazy morning, huh?”\n\n“Ha! Sure is. What’s the deal?” I pulled away from the group with the K9 as he began to recount the story.\n\n“Well, I’m just driving down the road when I notice traffic is stopped ahead. Eventually I make it up to the intersection and there’s this dude in the middle of the road. He had his arms out like he had been crucified and was swiping the tops of the passing cars, staring ahead like he was dreaming. He looked like a zombie, man. So I stop my car, hit the lights, get out to see what the deal is and he snaps out of it. He looks at me and he is pissed! I’m like, ‘Dude, just chill,’ but he starts stepping at me with his fists all balled up. I start back peddling, giving him orders and everything, but he’s in the zone and I can tell he wants to hurt me. He pulls back to punch me and I dodge it and pull my taser. He doesn’t care at all and goes to swing again so I pop him with it, right in the chest. He just yells and swipes the probes out then takes off! Craziest thing ever!”\n\n“Damn. Taser had no effect?”\n\n“Nope. I mean, I may not have had good separation but they hit him. Dude is fast too. He got the jump but I’ve been running a lot lately and couldn’t keep him from pulling away. I saw him run up to this kid leaving his house and he shoved the kid into the bushes and tried to kick in the door to the house.”\n\nPat scrunched his face up in a moment of contemplation. “I guess I should go back and try and figure out who that kid was…” He snapped out of it and continued the story. “So then, when the guy doesn’t get the door in his first two or three kicks, he looks back and me and bolts again. I last see him rounding the corner behind a row of houses and he was gone. Like a strung out ghost, man.” He chuckled and shook his head as we pulled within eyeshot of his cruiser. \n\n“15-Bravo-6!” A voice rang out over the radio. “I… I think I see the subject. He’s hopping fences, heading north towards Beech again!”\n\nHe was a block away, heading in the same direction we were. \n\nI flicked on my lights again and Pat started searching out his window. We broke through the neighborhood and out onto Beech just as the suspect came sprinting out from behind a privacy fence to my left. “There!” I yelled to get Pat’s attention so I could go back to making sure I didn’t run over anyone. \n\n“He’s going towards the townhouses again! Make this left!” \n\nI jerked the car to the left, tires squealing in protest but gripping nonetheless. I gunned it down the almost deserted street and came to a dead end. \n\n“He should be coming out here in a second.” Pat said as he quickly shrugged off his seatbelt and jumped out the car. I joined him and a moment later we saw our guy, running in our direction. Sirens were echoing off the narrow buildings all around us and Pat gripped his radio, yelling our current location to the in-coming backup units. \n\n“Get on the ground! NOW!!” I yelled at the man. He had seen us but hadn’t slowed his approach. He came within twenty yards before coming to an abrupt stop, then, looking a bit confused, ran a few laps in a small circle only he could see before picking a new heading and sprinting off. He was drenched in sweat and panting but showing no other sign of fatigue. Pat and I took off after him, crossing between the buildings he had just passed and by my elderly gardener friend who had retreated to the safety of her storm door. As I sprinted by, I nodded and smiled in her direction but wasn’t sure she noticed. \n\nThe man came to an eight foot privacy fence and didn’t hesitate, vaulting it with ease similar to an antelope fleeing a predator. Pat and I were stymied for a moment, scrambling to find our footing as we attempted to join our target on the other side of the obstacle. \n\n“Dude’s fast.” I huffed as I hoisted myself over the fence. \n\n“You’re telling me.” Pat scoffed back. \n\nI landed on the other side and realized we were once again on a large, four lane street, jammed with the mornings commuters. \n\nI saw another uniformed officer sprinting towards a squat utility building and forecast his trail towards the front. The man was there, trying to pry open the door with all his strength. I couldn’t hear the words but from the rigid posture of the officer, and his hand on his still holstered gun, I could tell he was giving the man commands to give up. The man instead glanced at him, then stuck his chest out and began approaching the cop. I was still in a full run when I saw the stream of hateful liquid exit the small canister in the officer’s right hand. The pepper spray hit its mark, and the man stopped in his tracks to wipe his brow with his forearm. He then took off in the opposite direction from the uniformed officer. \n\nPat was off course but still nearby. My trajectory had placed me in the perfect position to intercept the suspect. I pumped my arms hard and forced air into my burning lungs. The man made it to the same fence Pat and I had just vaulted and made a move to again scale it with ease. I had other plans for him. \n\nI braced for impact, lowered my shoulder, and threw myself into his wide-open back, crushing him against the fence before wrapping him up and tackling him to the ground. “Stay down!” I growled at him. He kicked wildly and clawed at my back with his free hand. I sprawled my feet to maintain balance while also placing all my weight on him. Soon I was joined by several officers, grabbing his various flailing limbs in an effort to get cuffs on. \n\nPat, unable to find a position to grab an arm or leg, pulled his taser again. The perp was able to free one of his sweat-slippery arms and swatted at my leg. He chomped at the hand of a motor cop who had jumped into the fray. The motor cop pulled his hand back and yelled, “Tase him, tase him!” Hoping we could get a neuro-muscular disruption long enough to restrain him. \n\nPat’s taser popped and the probes barely missed me as they plunged into the man’s leg. There was no reaction from the man. He was able to free another arm and pushed both hands underneath him, effectively doing a push-up with the weight of five fully equipped cops on his back. I slipped out of the fracas and drew my taser, intending to drive stun the man while Pats probes were still in his leg, thus closing the circuit and over-running his muscular system into rigid submission. I pulled the cartridge off and jabbed him in the shoulder. Still there was no reaction. \n\nWorried the suspect might still break loose and unable to reposition myself to a place where I’d be of use, I stepped back and went to put my cartridge back onto my taser. A wild kick from the suspect sent one of the cops tumbling into my leg. The force popped the cartridge into its position but also caused me to pull the trigger. The safety was still off. \n\nThe jolt of pain was brief but intense as I flicked off the taser’s safety and tried to yank the thin leads from my palm. One of the probes came out easily, the other stuck in the meaty-boney part of my hand just below my fingers. I had to grit my teeth as I pulled that one free. Growled threats and commands floated through the air amongst various grunts and suggestions on how to properly subdue the suspect. I was in a bit of adrenaline induced stupor as I stared at the blood while it quickly dripped from the two new holes in my hand. \n\n“We need some ankle cuffs over here!” The request shook me from my trance and I scanned over the shoddily cuffed man on the ground, still thrashing and attempting to bite whoever was closest to him. \n\n“I got some!” I jogged back to my car and retrieved my shackles. As I trotted back to the scene, the second hand pepper spray started kicking in. I passed the leg cuffs to Pat, then realized I couldn’t open my eyes without it feeling like they were full of sand. Sand and needles. \n\n“Jesus, EMR. You ok? What’s all that blood from?”\n\n“Yeah, yeah. I’m fine. Just tased myself in the hand. And got pepper spray in my eyes.” My arms began to burn like someone treating chlamydia with lemon juice. “And all over my arms…” I was quickly realizing my morning was not going to way I had hoped. \n\n“Well,” Pat started. “Rescue is on the way for this guy. He’s bleeding all over too.” \n\nI was able to crack an eyelid wide enough to check the still-chomping suspect. Sure enough, a bright stain of blood was leeching into the waist band of his boxers. \n\n“Crap.”\n\n“At least they’ll be able to flush your eyes?” Pat tried to find the silver lining.\n\nThe bad guy ended up getting transported to the hospital and was eventually charged with various assaults and burglaries (he broke into another house and assaulted the homeowner while we were searching for him). He fought deputies at the jail and was still there when Pat returned with a search warrant for a blood draw to ensure we weren’t subjected to any infectious diseases. I had my own agency-ordered blood draw that came back clean. The blood for the suspect returned disease free, but there was a large amount of both alcohol and PCP present, explaining the super-human strength. \n\nI’m still fighting off the nickname “Sparky.” \n",

In this specific scenario, we were equipped with \"fake\" guns that were almost exact replicas of our service weapons, but shot a modified form of paintballs. For safety, we also wore face protection for these scenarios. The paintballs moved fast enough that you couldn't see them coming at you. Closed course, safe environment.\n\nI was a passenger in a car with my partner, and we had another car unit with us with two other officers in it. It started out with a pursuit, as we pursued a suspect wanted for carjacking. We went a few blocks until the suspect slammed on his brakes in front of us. We came to a stop about 50 feet behind him. All four of us exited our vehicles, drew our guns, stayed behind cover, and one officer went over the car's loudspeaker to give verbal commands.\n\nThe suspect immediately exited the car and started yelling and marching back towards us. He was yelling how he was going to kill us all, we had no authority, and our lives would be over. The officer continued to give the suspect verbal commands as the suspect pointed to each of us individually, with both hands clearly visible. He kept ignoring the officer's commands.\n\nIn less time than I could process, the suspect drew a pistol from the back of his waistband and got two shots off right at my head. I was fatally hit twice before I could move my finger on to the trigger of my gun. I was \"dead.\" The remaining officers dropped the suspect with a volley of fire, but it didn't do much to help me.\n\nThe lesson: action is always faster than reaction.\n\n",

        "text": "Last month I was in Las Vegas for a business trip. I had driven out (from Colorado) with my business partner, and we decided to stay an extra day after our business had concluded, the better to rest before ~12 hours driving back (we both have a lot of physical pain, and previous trips had convinced us of the necessity of this extra day). I had booked a room on the strip, near where the business event which we had come to Vegas to attend was being held, while my partner had booked an AirBnB about half an hour north. So, I had no obligations for that day (a Thursday). \n\nSome background on me: I am a medical marijuana patient (since 2006, years before even medical dispensaries came to Colorado!). My partner and I brought NO cannabis products, nor paraphernalia, with us across state lines (it's just dumb, especially going through Utah!). A few days previous, after we had gotten finished with our business for that day, I wandered onto the strip, found a friendly fellow who gave me an, \"eighth\" (which is supposed to be 3.5 grams FYI), which consisted of three (supposedly) gram bags (I would guess it was closer to 2.7g than 3, certainly was not 3.5!) for fifty bucks (for comparison, the rec dispensary that is a ten minute walk from my home has their best stuff available for as little as $16 - just shy of $20 with tax - with regular, daily specials). Now, the hotel at which I was staying has a $300 fee if you smoke in your room during your stay. So, after things were all finished each day, I would go to a lonely corner of a nearby parking garage to smoke a little bit. When Thursday came around - it had been 115*F several days that week, I forget what the high temp was that Thursday but it was over 100*F between 0700-2200 - I didn't want to go sit at the top of the parking garage under the blazing desert sun. My room was on the top floor of the hotel, so that morning, I just ducked into a nearby stairwell, took a few hits off of my pipe, and found that the doorknob back to my floor was kind of tough (I have a lot of weakness in my arms/hands) for me, so I just walked down to the next floor, opened that one, and used the elevator to return to my room. \n\nWell, later that day, I had about one big bowl of medicine left, and decided to slip into my favorite stairwell to puff on half of what I had left before taking a shower. I did so, and, just as I was going to place my foot on the top step to get to the floor below, a cop opened the door. Now, I have nervous system issues, one symptom of which is that I startle frequently and easily. The combination of the door opening and my precarious footing caused me *almost* to fall, but years of professional patienting have honed my reflexes, and I was able to catch myself with one hand (which hurt for over two weeks afterward!), before stepping back from the edge, and collapsing. I was shaking from the adrenaline, and the officer - who had already called in that I had fallen - tried to calm me as he radioed that I was negative for injuries. \n\nI've never been on the prosecuted side of any police encounter whatsoever, but have had family and friends in the force. I had my purse with me, including my ID, room key, business cards, etc. I began speaking with the officer, who said, \"Don't worry, it's okay,\" regarding the weed, but I told him, \"DUDE. I almost *fell*!\" to explain why I was shaking. \"Well, me being a cop probably didn't help,\" he mused. I handed him my ID and room key, told him my room number, etc. He then said, \"Y'know, you can finish your bowl,\" and I thought that was a fine idea! So, I sat and smoked, and spoke with the nicest police officer I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. He told me that his whole family in California, himself included, \"Before I decided to become a cop, anyway,\" are/were stoners. \"If you had been smoking speed, though, or some shit like that....\" he began, and I kind of laughed - I have a congenital heart issue, and get enough grief from my doctors for smoking cigarettes! \n\nAt the tail end of the drive into Vegas, I had a random thought come to me, and expressed it to my business partner, about police officers. I said something to the effect of, \"Y'know, I think I know how racists must feel, because I have a deep and abiding prejudice against cops.\" I was a victim of a very violent gang rape, many moons ago, and the reaction of the individual officer to my tale on that day has since twisted my view on, and perception of, all police officers in general, as a group. I tearfully related this to my new friend in blue, who said, \"We're not all hardasses, y'know? People have so many negative perceptions of the police.\" I replied that this encounter with him had certainly changed my own views, and thanked him for helping me on this part of my journey. He then walked me back to my room, saying that as long as housekeeping saw him walking with me, I would have no problems whatsoever.\n\nI related my, \"surreal cop experience,\" to my business partner the next day as we drove back, and to my SO when I returned home. So thank you, officer E.C. for helping me in this journey we call life.",

Most of our calls were stuff like alcohol offenses, traffic accidents, parties, the usual fair for a college.\n\nOur school contracted out to the local PD for after-hours security as well, since we couldn't carry any fun toys like tazers and the like. Liability clauses are a bitch. They would generally stay on until about 0200, and then I'd have the place to myself until the boss came in at 0630 and I could sleep.\n\nThis particular evening, I was working with [Officer Shitmagnet](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheSquadCar/comments/41ax4z/friend_officer_shitmagnet_or_how_i_learned_to/?ref=search_posts). It had been quiet the whole night save for a couple parking tickets. Of course, that luck didn't last long.\n\nTwenty minutes before he was supposed to leave, he gets a call over the radio.\n\n\"Unit 19, dispatch.\"\n\n*Groan* \"Dispatch, 19, go for it.\"\n\n\"We've got two units dispatched to the college, reports of an intoxicated individual who fell and hit his head on the sidewalk by the auditorium. EMS is en-route, but you were closer so...\"\n\nHe looked at me like someone had just shit in his coffee before keying up. \"Roger...heading over there now.\" \n\nI hop in the passenger seat of his old Tahoe, laughing as the twenty-year old engine sputters to life. \"You're cursed, admit it.\"\n\n\"Nope, this is totally all your fault.\" He grumbles, turning towards the road that would take us up to the theater. \"I'm fucking magical, you're the one who's messing around with sorcery or some shit.\"\n\nBefore we can decide who summoned the dark lord, his searchlight finds our client for the evening; older gentleman with messy hair, tattered beard, and stained clothes. We stopped a few yards short of him as he was crawling along the grass, but even from there I could smell the sickening combination of vomit and alcohol.\n\nI paint him with my flashlight first, calling out from a few feet away in case things were about to turn ugly. \"Evening sir, campus security and the police here, you doing okay?\"\n\nHe was on all fours, dry-heaving and trying vainly to get up onto his feet. Turning towards us, he mumbled something and actually managed to get vertical briefly before falling over again. \"F-fug off! I'mmm f-fine!\"\n\nThe officer couldn't help chuckling quietly, circling around to his left while pulling on a pair of gloves. \"That nasty cut on your forehead says otherwise, why don't you let me give you a hand?\"\n\nI looked up the streets as two more patrol units pulled up, lights flashing. By now everyone else was wearing gloves, and in our industry we call that a clue. Slipping on a pair myself, I helped Sgt Shitmagnet haul him into a sitting position on the side of the curb.\n\nThis poor bastard couldn't get out a full sentence without gagging and dry-heaving, head wobbling around like a newborn giraffe. One of the other units knelt down and flashed a penlight in his eyes. \"I'm just going to check you out for a concussion, sir. Do you know what day it is?\"\n\nHe swatted at the light, missing it by a mile. \"I dun f-fuggin' know, f-fuggin- *hrrrrrk*...\"\n\n\"What's your name?\"\n\n\"A-are you arrestin' me you fugging pi- *Hrrrrrrk*\"\n\nWe were almost in tears with silent laughter as EMS showed up. The medics took one look at him before pulling out the gurney with included restraints. At first drunky struggled a bit when the officers tried hauling him onto it, but whatever he had drunk didn't give him much motivation or hand-eye coordination. \n\nThe medics finally load him up, and we get a one-finger salute before they shut the doors and start driving to the hospital. After carefully discarding of my now tainted gloves, I climbed back into the car with the Sgt. \n\n\"Well, that was fun.\"\n\nHe laughed, popping it into drive. \"Hey, could've been a lot worse. He could've stabbed you instead.\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"Oh yeah, that guy just got out of prison a year ago for stabbing his brother like sixteen times. Violent son of a bitch, we were lucky he was drunk.\"\n\nI was flabbergasted. \"Wait...he's more violent when he's SOBER?\"\n\nThe Sgt. nodded. \"Oh yeah, he's a mad man. He's a lot easier to deal with when he's shit-faced. Weird, right?\"",

        "text": " Wall of text warning. First four paragraphs are the set up. You can just to \"Story starts here:\" if you would like. \n\nI spent some time as a detainee operation manager (correctional officer for terrorists) in Afghanistan. It's was annoying at times but I was pretty good at it, and got certified as a journeyman correctional officer while I was there. When I got back to the states, having no college yet, I figured \"I've got this certification, I'm good at it, why not do this stateside?\"\n\nFast forward 9 months or so later. I have been a county CO for 8 months, after taking a month off to chill after Afghanistan. Up to this point, Afghanistan and county, I have never gotten to use any of my training. \n\nI need you to understand that I'm not a violent person, but I've done martial arts my entire life and I excelled at every martial art that involves laying hands on someone, wrist locks, misdirection of power/force, etc. Because of my excessive training, I always talk my way out of fights because it's pointless if it isn't life or death. Maybe I get hurt, but in my mind it's like a Ferrari beating a minivan in a street race. What do I have to brag about when whooping someone who doesn't know half the stuff I do. \n\nBack on subject, I have yet to use any training on any inmates, or even the detainees when I was in Afghanistan. The only time I got to was in training BEFORE Afghanistan, and I sent a guy to the hospital with a hole in his eyelid from a rock on the ground, after I helped him to it. At this point, I'm not foaming at the mouth, but being in a security position and never having to secure someone has left me wanting. \n\nStory starts here:\n\nSo there I was, on rape watch (sitting with the nurse in medical making sure nobody raped her) when my Sergeant walks in. The nurse, glancing at him as he walks in, sees one inmate rush another in the hall behind him as the door shuts. \"The inmates are fighting in the hallway!\" She shouts. \n\nMy sergeant has the dumbest look on his face \"who's fighting in the hallway?\" He asks. Having just come from the hallway, there's no way that someone is already fighting right?\n\nI'm already flying past my sergeant. I had told all the inmates that I wouldn't use force against them unless they earned it, but man the first person that earns it is is gonna get speared by 200 pounds of \"I wish I could have done this to a detainee.\"\n\nAs I burst through the door I'm looking at two inmates on the other side of the hall, One with a mop in hand, having caught it as the sanitation worker who got attacked flung it towards him. Both of the men, looking at me, point towards the fight. I turn to see two 250 lb black guys in glorious combat, and I thank I might have said a quiet \"thank you God\" as I set my feet. \n\nI crouched into a 100 meter dash, almost horizontal sprint towards these guys as I ran past 3 wet floor signs that I was too focused to have noticed. I'm sure you see where this is going. These guys were about 40 feet away and I think I made it 10 before I went airborne. Squeak! I was now feet first flying towards the battle about 4 feet off the deck which was tile. \n\nI was county and didn't have a cuff holder so I kept one cuff tucked in the back of my belt and the other dangling right over my tailbone. My LT burst out of the control room right next to the fight, just in time to see me fly past him. I will never forget the look of WTF on him face as he watched me go by. \n\nEveryone managed to make it into the hallway for the landing. The nurse, sergeant, lieutenant, and both the guys fighting, paused everything to watch me slam into the ground and skid to a stop at the inmates feet with a chorus of \"OH\" that echoed through the whole deck. I had landed on my handcuffs also, so i was in considerable pain. \n\nI was fine after all was said and done, but terribly upset. Having done this job for almost 2 years at the time and never once used my training. I finally get the chance and literally bust my tailbone. Nothing was broken...except my heart. \n\nTL;DR finally got to use my training and slipped on a mopped floor and full speed.  \n\nEdit: a word",

        "text": "We received a call of active road-rage. This is extremely common and we almost never find the involved parties since it's witnesses calling in. This day wasn't common. \n\n\"Dispatch to all units, we have reports of a reckless driver, stopping traffic, and blocking in the reporting party. They're coming in from Springfield. The reporting party is advising that that a driver in a pickup keeps trying to stop them, and they can't get away. Do we have a unit in position to assist?\"\n\nI go en route. \"Unit 2, I'll be from Washington Street.\" I was the closest one, but still pretty far away and had no expectation of finding anyone.\n\n\"Dispatch to Unit 2, I copy from Washington Street. Be advised, this started in Springfield's area and they have two units trying to catch up, stuck in traffic.\"\n\nI made my way that general direction. The reporting party was staying on the phone and kept giving us updates. I kept getting a little closer as they stayed going the same direction. \"Dispatch to Unit 2, they're stopped at Jefferson Street now.\" \"Unit 2, I'm just about there.\" I realized I was actually going to find them, so I wanted some more information. \"Unit 2, do we have any further? What started this? Number of occupants in the suspect vehicle? Weapons displayed?\" This all determines how much force I will and can anticipate. My dispatcher came back, \"Unit 2, that's a negative. The reporting party sta--\"\n\nI cut my dispatcher off, \"Unit 2, I've got a visual, making contact. I'll advise status.\" \"Unit 3 en route to assist Unit 2.\" One of my guys finally decided to head my way and help. Dispatch echoed, \"Unit 2 making contact, I'll be waiting for your status.\n\nI came up to the exit ramp and saw a silver sedan on the shoulder, with a pickup truck almost completely sideways in front of it. Everyone was still in their cars. I more or less stomped out of my vehicle, expecting a confrontation with the pickup driver. As I did so, the female passenger in the car exited and started yelling, \"I want to press charges!\" I yelled back at her, \"Get back in your car!\" She did so.\n\nI approached the pickup driver, who had his window down and both hands out the window. \"Keys!\" He handed them to me. \"What is going on?\"\n\n\"Sir, they have my daughter. My daughter is in that car, sir, and I'm just trying to get her back.\" Not anywhere near what I was expecting. \"ID.\" He handed me his ID.\n\n\"How old is your daughter?\" \n\n\"She's 12.\" \n\n\"Wait in your truck.\" To dispatch, \"Unit 2, situation normal.\"\n\nI went to talk to the other driver, and male, and the passenger. \"Sir, do you know that man?\" He said no. The passenger said no. \"Have you ever met him before?\" No. The driver went with his story, \"We were just driving, and he came out of nowhere, trying to run us off the road. He was stopping the freeway and he got out of his truck and started walking towards us, so I got out of there and we called 9-1-1.\"\n\nWell, this is a little weird. \"Ma'am, how old are you?\"\n\n\"28.\"\n\nI started putting the puzzle pieces together as four other units showed up. I gave a brief run down of what I figured out in the 15 seconds prior to their arrival.\n\nAs a father trying to get his daughter back, the pickup truck driver's actions made some sense. 9-1-1 would've made more sense, but that's not everyone's first choice. Once he was made aware his daughter wasn't in the other vehicle, he was perfectly calm, and he was compliant the entire time. Once we established he didn't know his own daughter's birthday, or if he even really had a daughter, we started moving from the criminal aspect to the mental illness evaluation.\n\nThe other driver and passenger didn't want to press charges, and the pickup truck driver didn't really commit any crimes (unlawful stopping sure, but something serious like False Imprisonment would be one heck of a stretch). The other driver continued on, and the pickup driver agreed to get checked out by a psychiatrist. He went by ambulance.",

So, I'm on my way in to work a couple days later, and I decide to ask the Trooper about where I should take the vehicle, and what, if any, fees are involved.\n\nHe tells me he doesn't know off the top of his head, but gives me his card, and tells me to call him a few days later to follow up.\n\nAs I'm wrapping up my conversation with him, I notice his name on the card, specifically his last name.\n\nTurns out, he's the uncle of a kid I went to high school with!\n\nSo we chat for a couple minutes, and he tells me my former classmate is doing well for himself, and that he'd be happy to let him know I said \"hello\".\n\nIn the end, I decided not to retain the vehicle, and ended up in a new (used, but new to me) car.\n\nStill, it was pretty neat that I ran into someone who was related to someone else I knew from way back.\n\nGuess it really is a \"small world after all\".",

        "text": "“So, EMR…” \n\nI turned in my chair to greet Jim, one of the US Marshals I worked with, who was leaning on my cubicle wall. \n\n“…Is there another EMR in your department?” He was holding a stack of papers and grimacing a bit. \n\n“No. Not that I know of at least.” The grimace had me concerned. \n\nJim sighed and looked at his papers. He shuffled them a bit and sighed again. Then he handed them to me. “You’ve been served, BITCH!” He laughed and walked away. \n\nI scanned the papers he had just handed me and read the bold headline at top: “United States District Court, summons of Civil Action.”\n\nMy stomach dropped and I looked at the plaintiff’s name, not registering it in my mental Rolodex of people I may have pissed off. Before doing anything else, I decided, I would need to tell my boss. \n\nLt. was calm and collected when I broke the news. A veteran recently transferred from the Narcotics Division, he took it in stride. “Cool! Fed court!”\n\n“Not really, ‘Cool,’ I’d say - but it is what it is.”\n\n“Do you know this Janice lady?” He asked flipping through the thick stack of papers. \n\n“Doesn’t ring a bell but I haven’t read over the packet yet.”\n\n“Well,” he continued, flipping pages. “Looks like you and ‘Officer Braggs’ pissed someone off two years ago.”\n\n“Two years ago? And who the hell is Braggs?” I was even more confused now.\n\n“Your co-defendant. Says so right here.” He handed back the folded file. “Don’t sweat it. I’ll call IA and get started on the attorney notifications. You’re covered. If you’re not getting sued, you’re doing the job wrong! That’s what I say.”\n\nI only nodded back and wandered back to my desk, getting lost in the document. It read like a fifth grader tattling on the girl with cooties: hand written information on the summons, rambling accounts that conflicted with prior incomplete sentences, peppered in legal-ise that could only have been picked up from watching too many episodes of Law and Order… it took me a while to even figure out what the complaint was. I picked up the phone and dialed my co-defendant. \n\n“What’s up EMR?”\n\n“Not much Biggs. You get served yet?” \n\n“Served?” He asked. I was happy to be the bearer of bad news. \n\n“Yeah, with federal civil process? We’re getting sued.”\n\n“What’d we do?” He asked, astounded.\n\n“Well, it looks like sometime two years ago we, and I quote, ‘harassed, intimidated, and verbally abused the plaintiff and her 10 years old minor daughter throughout two hours duration in the house.’ Sounds about right, huh?”\n\n“Who is this lady?” I read him the name then flipped though the file. \n\n“The only other person she references is a guy named John who we were there to question her about.”\n\nBiggs murmured to himself a moment. “You don’t think she’s the girlfriend of that African dude, do you?”\n\nIt all clicked into place for me. This was the lady from that night – the lease holder of the closest place we could put as a residence for the mysterious John/Chris/Mike figure we had arrested for identity theft and credit card fraud. \n\n“This would be right up that dude’s alley, to pull some crazy jail scam to try and get some money off us. I thought he was deported?” Biggs was confident we had nailed down the case as well as the instigator in our new headache. \n\n“I can look into the ICE stuff and see if he’s in custody still. See if you can find anything about this interview we did. I’m sure the agency attorney will want it.”\n\nI found out our mystery man had been fighting deportation back to Sierra Leone and as such, was still being held stateside for a proper immigration trial. “He says the war lords back home want to kill him.” My ICE contact explained. \n\n“Yeah? Well there’s a line forming behind me.’ \n\nA week passed before Biggs and I were sitting in the waiting room to talk to our agency appointed attorney. Biggs hadn’t been able to find anything specific to the interview with the girlfriend, Janice, and I had been racking my brain to come up with as many details about the years-old event as I could. I hadn’t come up with much. \n\n“Biggs, EMR, Mrs. Newman will see you now.” The receptionist showed us back to a richly decorated office and indicated the two seats sitting on one side of a large desk. “She’ll be right in.”\n\nBiggs and I nervously scanned the bookshelves. “This sucks.” He said. I agreed. \n\n“Hey guys!” Newman entered her office with a big smile and clutching a file portfolio. “How are things?” \n\n“It’d be better if you would just tell us we can go home now and that this is all a bad dream.” I answered. \n\n“Ha! This isn’t going to be one of those, I’m afraid.” She sat down after shaking our hands and started sorting paperwork on her desk into several piles. “If you both want me to represent you, I’ll need all these forms filled out in triplicate. You could always hire your own attorney but that would come out of your pocket and I think I have a pretty strong handle on where this thing is going.” Biggs and I nodded along and signed obediently. \n\n“Now!” She sorted our freshly autographed documents once more before turning her attention to us again. “What do you two remember about that night?” \n\n“Not much to be honest.” I started. “It was a non-issue kind of deal. We had to talk to her for due diligence purposes, just to make sure we weren’t missing some mother lode. She didn’t add anything to our case at all.”\n\nNewman nodded along with me while she flipped pages of a file. “Yeah, it says as much in this report. ‘Went to an ex-girlfriend’s residence for interview, no further leads developed.’ That’s the only reference to her in the whole file.”\n\n“Exactly.” Biggs said. “She paints this picture of us barging in against her consent, destroying her house while we looked for evidence, and acting like boogeymen towards her daughter. I don’t even remember her daughter!”\n\n“Well, that’s the bulk of her complaints, true: fourth amendment violations and harassment. I certainly don’t see anything in here that would make me come up with the one million dollar figure she’s asking for though.”\n\n“Million dollars?” I scoffed. \n\n“Yeah. That’s the presumed amount of damages she has indicated she will accept as way of settlement. Per defendant, by the way.”\n\n“Two million dollars?!” I scoffed again. \n\n“Three, really. She added a John Doe officer after her initial filing.”\n\n“Three-”\n\n“She’s crazy.” Biggs interrupted. \n\n“I know, right? Did you read this whole thing? Clearly someone wrote all the legal stuff for her then she filled in all the complaint information. It’s one long paragraph. I can almost read it in her accent.” Newman seemed amused. \n\n“Well, you aren’t going to pay her out, are you?” Biggs asked, still agitated.\n\n“We’ll see. If it’s a she said-you said case, it might just be quicker and cheaper to offer a couple grand and be done with it.”\n\n“No way…” I leaned back in my seat. \n\n“Yeah. You and I know this is a BS case. Proving it in court, however… that’s a bit trickier.”\n\nMy hatred for our justice system grew a bit larger. \n\n“The good news is that we have time. Dig up everything about that mystery man you can. Anything specifically referencing Janice could be gold.”\n\nBiggs and I slowly made our way to our cars. “You really think they’ll pay this lady?” Biggs asked.\n\n“I guess so. I mean, Newman wouldn’t have been so quick to throw it out there if it was unusual, right?” \n\n“God this sucks.” Biggs concluded. \n\nDays passed and little came from our search to show for it. I was on the phone with Biggs, telling him as much. \n\n“I don’t want to give this lady any money, man.” Biggs said. \n\n“I totally agree. I think I’d remember if I violated this lady’s rights.”\n\n“Right?” Biggs’ level of resentment towards the plaintiff was to a point where violating her rights wasn’t at the bottom of his list currently. “You know, though,” He started again. “I was going through the prosecution file for the credit card guy – the one we never used – and I found the recording from your camera thing.”\n\n“Oh yeah! I remember that. I should find that and start using it again…” I opened a desk drawer mindlessly while still holding the phone to my ear.\n\n“Yeah, but I was thinking: we were trying to use it all the time back then. Do you think maybe…?”\n\n“Oh. Oh! That I would’ve recorded this interview? I mean, maybe. Where would it be though?” \n\n“I was thinking about that too. We stopped using it shortly after this case, remember? Because Morris was complaining to Lt. that we were hiding it in his car trying to catch him talking shit?”\n\n“Ha! Yeah, that was pretty good.”\n\n“Well, maybe it’s still on the camera? In the memory?”\n\nIt was right at that moment when I found the camera – a large writing pen with a pin-hole camera in the top. It screwed apart at the middle revealing a USB plug. “Got it. It’s in my computer. You ready?”\n\n“Do it.”\n\nI opened the My Computer icon and scrolled to the removable camera drive. Double clicking it opened a folder with several sub folders. They were arranged by date. I looked at the summons paperwork – a staple on my desk during that period – and noted the date of offense she claimed. I scanned the file dates and found one a few days after the date she claimed her rights were irrevocably violated and he daughter was scarred for life on. I double clicked the .AVI file which opened Media Player. My screen went from black to a video of Biggs in a hallway. He nodded to me and my pasty hand came into the frame, knocking on the metal apartment door. \n\n“Who is it?” A female voice with a heavy African accent asked.\n\n“Police, ma’am. Can we have a moment of your time?” I replied, sweet as honey. \n\nThe door opened and a smiling Janice greeted us. “Hello! Please, please – come in!” She stepped aside and ushered us into the living room.\n\n“Dude.” I said into the receiver. \n\n“What? Did you find it?” \n\n“DUDE!” I said again.\n\n“I’m calling Newman! Meet me there!” Biggs hung up on me. I stood up from my chair and fist pumped. \n\nA car ride and twenty minute video review later, Newman was all smiles. \n\n“How did you guys forget you had this?”\n\n“I forgot I even had the camera until Biggs reminded me.” I answered. \n\n“He always forgot he had that stupid thing.” Biggs scolded. \n\n“Well, I wouldn’t call something that just saved the department several thousand dollars in settlement money stupid.”\n\nNewman went to the courts with our video. She was hopeful the case would be flat out dismissed but the liberal federal judge wanted to take his time with the case. Between discovery – where Janice was provided a copy of the video – and his decision on dismissal, Janice had somehow managed to retain an attorney. The judge decided to allow the case to move forward with an amended claim – negating all claims of fourth amendment violations but retaining the claim that we caused great “mental distress for the daughter to the point she became physically ill whenever she so much as saw an officer in public.” Newman was astounded but resolute we would fight the case to the bitter end. \n\n“I’m not giving this liar any of my tax dollars.” She muttered as we exited court after the ruling. \n\nSeveral months of hemming and hawing (as is the way of most court processes) the day finally came for Biggs and me to testify to the jury. I had a terrible flu come on the night before but opted to persevere in hopes of just being done with the case. Janice had fired her attorney for “lack of working” and sat alone at the plaintiff desk. The judge was progressively getting fed up with her Matlock impersonation and Janice was becoming enraged with her inability to further her case. \n\nWhen it was my turn to get on the stand, I shambled up and smiled to the jury before taking my seat. \n\n“Mr. Officer EMR. Did you not enter my house and search without me saying yes that you could or not?” \n\n“I… I’m sorry?” \n\n“Objection, your honor. There is no further claim of violating the plaintiff’s civil rights of unlawful search and seizure.”\n\n“Sustained. Ms. Janice, please – for the fourth time. Your lines of questioning must be within reason of your amended complaint.”\n\nJanice rolled her eyes, almost audibly. She continued. “When you talked to my daughter, did you scare her?” \n\n“I don’t know. No? I’m pretty good with talking to kids.”\n\nJanice nodded her head, searching for her next question. “My daughter is scared of you.”\n\nI went to answer but stopped when I opened my mouth, instead looking to Newman for help. \n\n“Your honor?” She asked, standing up. \n\n“Yes Mrs. Newman, I agree.” He sighed and rubbed his eyes. “Ms. Janice? Do you have any more *questions* for the officer?” \n\nShe squinted her eyes and stared at me a moment. “No further questions your honor.” \n\nThe judge sighed in relief. “Mrs. Newman?”\n\n“Thank you your honor. Officer EMR. On the night indicated, do you remember responding to Ms. Janice’s residence?”\n\n“Yes.” \n\n“Do you remember the context of the visit?”\n\n“To interview her concerning her relationship with a possible fraud suspect we were investigating.”\n\n“And did she provide any information to assist in the investigation?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Do you remember speaking with Ms. Janice’s ten year old daughter?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Do you know who did talk to her?”\n\n“Officer Biggs.”\n\n“No further your honor.”\n\n“Ms. Janice? Anything else for this witness?”\n\nShe stood and paced to the middle of the court room again. \n\n“Mr. Officer. Do you remember telling my daughter she was in trouble?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“You did tell my daughter she was in trouble.”\n\nOne of the jurors guffawed. \n\n“Quiet please.” The judge requested. “Ms. Janice: anything else?” His tone stated he believed she should go no further.\n\n“No.”\n\n“Officer, thank you for coming in. You are subject to recall.”\n\nI passed Biggs on the way out and collapsed into a sick heap on one of the pews in the hallway. I think I passed out because the next thing I remember was Biggs shaking me awake. \n\n“Dude. We’re done.” He was smiling. \n\n“*Done* done? Or just for the day?”\n\n“For the day but I think we’re as good as done either way. The judge hates that bitch, ha!”\n\nNewman stepped out a moment later. “Walk with me fellas!” She was all smiles and we started for the exit. “He won’t say as much but the judge is half a step from booting this steaming pile. I think he realizes the mistake he made by not kicking it months ago but it’s far enough now that he wants to make sure it ends up in a higher court if she wants to go further.”\n\n“What’s that mean for us?” Biggs asked. \n\n“It means keep your ear to the phone tomorrow and I’ll call as soon as the jury rules in our favor!” She gave Biggs a congratulatory hug, turned to take in my green tint and drooping eyes and offered me a guarded pat on the head, and we were done. \n\nI threw up in the parking lot. \n\nTrue to her guess, Newman informed us the next day we were done. Janice made it known she was upset but when the judge explained the fees involved with an unsuccessful appeal, agreed she may not want to take the case further. \n\nA few months later, Jim was at my desk again. \n\n“If you’re serving me with a federal summons, you can go F off.” \n\nJim looked around. “And where exactly would I go to do that? There aren’t many private places around here and I don’t want to embarrass you with my girth.”\n\n“It’s not…”\n\n“You’ve been served! Again! Bitch!”\n\nThe plaintiff - Mike/John/Whoever - was striking once again from the dark recesses of some federal jail. I sighed and went to go tell Lt. \n",

        "text": "On Thanksgiving eve (is that a thing?) a few years ago I was enjoying a steak dinner provided by a local church with other officers. Mid chew, I hear the ominous \"felony tones\" coming from my radio. The tones are three loud beeps that dispatch sends to the radios before they send an officer to a high priority call. Basically, it means \"aye! Everybody stop what you're doing, drop your donuts, and listen up!\"\n\nWe all freeze and look at each other wondering which one of us is going to be the lucky designated primary officer to whatever shit just hit the fan. Annnnnd, that would be me.\n\n\"Bravo 1 robbery in progress 123 Oak street at the J-Mart\"\n\nI jump up with a purpose and leave with the mutual unspoken understanding that one officer will stay behind remaining in service and be in charge of cleaning up the mess me and 4 other officers just left behind.\nDispatch updates me saying that the cashier of the gas station was robbed at gun point and the offenders have fled the scene east bound in a white vehicle.\n\nI was the second officer on scene and arrived seeing that my supervisor was speaking to the cashier who was now sitting in the driver's seat of her vehicle out front. When I approached I saw that the cashier was in a semi catatonic state, staring foward, and not responding to the prodding necessary questions from my supervisor. She was obviously terrified, and he was getting no where with her. Finally, he turns to me and says, \"see if you can get anything out of her\".\n\nEven though my adrenaline is still pumping from the code run, I decide to take the caring sympathetic approach since the Detatched urgency approach from my supervisor had proved to be ineffective. I didn't know the cashier personally but had spoke with her on numerous occasions during my various visits to the gas station. I didnt remember her name and take a quick glance at her name tag before I proceed.\n\n\"mary, it's officer Anon, I know you're scared and that's completely understandable but for right now I have some really important questions I need to......\"\n\n\"It was two guys! Two Hispanic guys! They came in with masks and had a gun they held it to the back of my head!\"\n\nI was startled by her excited utterance but seized the moment to get a vehicle description so we could find these guys. Sobbing and shaking, she is able to give me a make, model, color, and direction of travel for the offenders. I immediately relay all of this to the several officers urgently searching for the armed assailants.\n\nI ask her some more questions and her cell phone rings. She looks up at me obviously wanting to take the call but not knowing if she can. I had what I needed for the time being and other stuff I needed to do. I tell her to take the call and get much needed support from a loved one while officers are running around like chickens with their heads cut off. We were within talking distance if she needed anything.\n\nIt was all down hill from there and the first time I got a front row seat to repeat showings of just how frustrating witnesses can be.\n\nAs I am setting up crime scene and taping off the area with universally understood \"police line do not cross\" yellow tape, a car speeds into the parking lot and stops just short of crossing the yellow line near where I am standing. It immediately puts me on edge and I start backing up to prepare for whatever this person came speeding up to a crime scene for. A middle aged man exits the car:\n\n\"Excuse me ma'am, I have a question\"\n\nI'm thinking \"seriously? Are you serious right now.\" but foolishly continue to give him the benefit of the doubt because whatever he has to say might possibly be pertinent to my investigation.\n\n\"Someone stole my prescription medication, I think I know who it is. Last week I met this girl.....and we stayed in a hotel.... I really need a report...... (rambles on).\n\nI nterrupt him and muster a response that doesn't sound near as pissed as I actually am. Assuming this happened locally I was going to quickly give him a non emergency number to call and send him away. \" Sir, where did this even happen? \"\n\n\"In nashville\"\n\nI stare at him blankly choosing my next words as carefully as I can because officer nice quickly lost all professional courtesy upon learning this happened in a completely different state. Several days ago.\n\n\"sir.i don't know if you noticed but I'm a little busy right now. I'm not real sure what makes you think it's okay to drive up on an active crime scene with an unrelated general law inquiry, but I suggest you leave now and call Nashville p. D.\"\n\nI walked away shaking my head completely baffled by the interaction that just occured, but am immediately distracted by another car that was pulling in near the crime scene.\n\nI begin my \" dear baby Jesus please help me\" prayer I say when I'm quickly losing patience, and approach the driver side to see a wide eyed female taking in the chaotic looking scene.\n\n\"yes ma'am can I help you\"\n\nStill looking ahead as she begins to respond she tells me that she doesn't know what exactly happened but about 30 minutes prior she had driven by the gas station and remembers seeing something that might be relevent. I relax a little upon realizing it isn't another moron hell bent on showing me just how much common sense they lack.\n\nBut I'm not relaxed for long.\n\nShe proceeds to tell me that as she was driving by, she saw two men wearing masks running out the front door. One was carrying what appeared to be a stick or gun and the other was holding a bag. They quickly ran to the side of the building and got into a white vehicle.\n\nI nod my head and just stare back at her, hoping she will have an epiphany about the statement she just made to me. I am simultaneously filtering through numerous smart Alec comments in my head attempting to formulate a professional response.\n\n\n\"Okay, did you relay that information to 911?\"\n\n\"No.... I just.... I didn't know.... I thought maybe it was kids goofing off....\"\n\nThough her information would of been helpful much sooner, she did offer an observation that was good to know. She remembered that one of the males got into the passenger seat and the other male appeared to be getting into the back seat. This let us know that there was at least three people involved, the third being the getaway driver.\n\nI had her fill out a witness statement and continued working the scene.\n\n\nThen ANOTHER vehicle pulled up. When I go to speak to the driver I see that he and his female passenger had the same shocked facial expression the first witness had. He then said,\" I don't know what happened but... \"\n\n\"dear lord baby jesus, dear lord baby jesus. \"\n\n\"....we were on our way to the mall earlier and saw guys with masks running out of the store. They got into a white car, sped out of the parking lot, and pulled right out in front of us. We had to brake really hard to keep from hitting them. \"\n\nMy frustration is alleviated for a moment as I realize its possible they may be able to tell me a license plate number.\n\nBut no, they couldnt. They stayed behind the vehicle for several miles still enroute to their mall destination and continued on when the offenders turned off on another road. No call to 911. Nothing. They too assumed what they had witnessed surely wasn't what it looked like.\n\nAt the time, I was a rookie officer and couldn't wrap my mind around how someone could plainly something was amiss but choose to assume its not what it seems and continue on their way. I now know this type of reasoning is rediculously common. It has a psychological term that is evading me at the moment. Similar to the bystander effect, but not exactly.\n\nMy most recent encounter with this type of behavior was while investigating an attempted car theft at a different gas station. A mother got out of her vehicle to pump gas and left her 10 year old and 3 year old in the car. A man ran up, pushed the ten year old out of the car, and attempted to drive away with the 3 year still inside. Mama bear promptly commenced to whoop ass in an attempt to protect her child. The ten year old ran a few pumps over to the closest bystander and pleaded for the large grown man to help his mother. The man proceeded to turn around, get back in his car, and drive away. He later reconsidered his decision and called to report the incident an hour later (police were already aware). He stated he assumed it was a domestic argument between husband and wife and didn't want to get involved in a marital spat.\n\nluckily, the mother was able to beat the offender into realizing the car wasn't worth it and he fled on foot.\n\nMoral of the story is: if you need help, Don't just say \"Please help me, I need help\". If you don't give a clear representation of the emergency or a clear direction in the help that you want, this might happen. It might happen anyway, but what can ya do.\n\nTo this day, neither the robbery offender or car thief has been identified or captured.\n\n[UPDATE] \nThe male who got his butt whooped by Mama Bear when he tried to drive away in her car with her 3 year old still inside has been CAUGHT. \nMyself and another officer responded to an altered mental status (crazy person) call the other day.  A mother said her schizophrenic son was causing a disturbance.  When we got there,  he was obviously in a manic type delusional state ranting and yelling at the top of his lungs about various things like cigarettes,  needing a job,  prayer,  and Other random un related subjects.  He was very aggressive in his speech and stance while doing so.  We tried for upwards of 45 minutes to get him in a calmer place,  but if anything it just escalated.  After getting doctors orders to have him committed,  we went to handcuff him for the medics and it took four of us a good two minutes of struggling to successfully do so.  Those suffering from mental illness in the kind of state he was in tend to have some kind of supernatural physical  strength...and little ability to feel pain. (Of course,  I think it goes  without saying this is not always the case,  just often is.) \n\nWe finally get him on the stretcher and off to the hospital for a mental evaluation.  \n\nThe detective assigned to the car theft case saw a picture of the guy we had transported to the hospital and recognized him from numerous surveillance camera footage capturing his 3 day long crime spree.  After some further investigating,  it was confirmed this was our guy.  He is currently being held on $120,000 bond. ",

        "text": "I was working a weekend afternoon on the day of a big sports game and a holiday, so traffic was a nightmare. To top it off, three people on our understaffed shift left early due to reaching the maximum number of hours they could work. Our staff of 14 started with 9 for the day, and only had 6 by the afternoon. That day, two other units arrested drunk drivers and had to spend hours at the jail. So our 14 \"full staffing\" turned into 4. But we make do.\n\nI was Unit 2. Unit 3 got word that someone had crashed going eastbound near Main Street. He checks it out and finds two vehicles on the shoulder. No crash, just a blown tire, but in a bad spot. So he waited for the tow truck to arrive.\n\nHe came over the radio a few minutes later, \"Dispatch, do we have any calls of a crash westbound near Main Street? I see two cars on the right shoulder with their hazards on.\" Dispatch returns, \"No calls at the moment. Is there any available unit to check the area?\" Silence on the radio for about 10 seconds. Then the log popped up on my computer, and it's a big one. I chimed in, realizing Unit 3 was all alone in his sector since everyone who left early that day was near his beat. \"Unit 2, I'll be en route.\" Dispatch replied, \"Unit 2, I copy. We're just getting the log now. Looks like...possibly a dog in the road, someone in a van crashed but isn't hurt. Unknown if the dog is still alive.\"\n\nI head that way, passing Unit 3 along the way. Going the opposite direction, I can see traffic is almost at a stop. That's not that unusual for a dog call; people get out and try to catch it (note: don't do this if you enjoy being alive).\n\nAs I get closer, I turn on all my lights and block all lanes of traffic to assess what's going on. Traffic ahead clears and I can see the mayhem I've stumbled upon.\n\nRight shoulder: smashed pickup truck into a 20 foot wall, no one in it. One hundred feet ahead of that pickup truck, on the right shoulder, are two smashed cars. In the middle of the freeway is the dog, not moving. And blocking the fast lane are two more smashed cars. So I put it out over the air, \"Unit 2, on scene, pickup on the right shoulder with crash damage, two other vehicles on the right, dead dog in the lanes, and two vehicles blocking the fast lane. I'll clear the dog first.\"\n\nI glove up and remove Fido from the lanes. Even with gloves, fresh roadkill isn't clean. He left his mark on my pants. I then drove to the vehicles on the shoulder to see if anyone was hurt. They were all uninjured. As I did this, traffic on the freeway took off again while the vehicles were still blocking the fast lane. So I had to stop traffic again as I made it over to left.\n\nUpon my arrival, only one vehicle was left in the lane. I kept the freeway stopped behind me, and I contacted the driver, \"Ma'am, are you okay?\" \"Yeah, but the other guy just took off!\" \n\n\"Okay, is your vehicle drive-able?\" \n\n\"Maybe. I can't believe he did that.\"\n\n\"I'm going to need you to drive your car to the right shoulder.\"\n\n\"What am I gonna do about the report?\"\n\n\"Ma'am, I have the entire freeway stopped for you. You need to get in your car and drive to the right shoulder.\"\n\n\"Where? There's no room. Right there?\"\n\n\"Yes, right there. Get in your car and drive to the shoulder. Now.\" I'm sure in her mind I was very rude. But her mind was focused on one negligible detail, and I was focused on getting out of the fast lane of the freeway.\n\nShe drove to the shoulder, as I followed, and opened the freeway back up. I could see Unit 3 in the distance with his flat tire guy. I went over the radio, \"Unit 2, can I get another unit? We're looking at a minimum of three crashes with six cars.\" Dispatch acknowledged and asked for another unit. I never heard anyone else go en route.\n\nI contacted everyone and figured out what happened. The people blocking the fast lane had a car in front of them swerve to avoid the dog, followed by braking. So the woman who was terribly concerned about the report rear-ended the car that swerved.\n\nThe other two vehicles on the right shoulder braked hard as traffic was braking for the dog. One person rear ended another.\n\nThe pickup truck braked hard, then swerved to the right shoulder because she wasn't going to stop in time (who needs safe following distances). She safely stopped on the right shoulder. But the car behind her did the same thing, and didn't stop in time. So she got hit from behind, and shoved into the wall. The car that hit her took off.\n\nA few minutes later, I watched Unit 3 get backed up by Unit 4. Then Unit 3 went to my location to back me up, but by that time I'd resolved all of the chaos. We've received reports in our area, specifically requesting more Troopers on patrol for all the crazy drivers. I've started to think of myself and fellow Troopers like unicorns; we're so rare we're practically mythical.",

        "text": "Having to prepare yet another fleet incident packet due to a goddamn deer got me to thinking about all the various times during my career that I've had to do this.  Most have been deer, and most of those have actually gotten up and run off after causing a few thousand dollars to my patrol car, much to my disgust.  \n\nA couple of them weren't deer.  One was a feral hog that was matte black, very low to the ground and weighed a few hundred pounds.  I didn't see him on a back county road in the middle of a moonless night.  One minute I'm doing upwards of 90 trying to get to one of those calls that could be something but is probably nothing, and the next moment I hit an invisible wall that completely destroyed the entire front end of my patrol car.  It freaked me right the hell out because I never saw the stupid thing.  It was low enough to the ground that it wiped out everything below the front bumper and took the front suspension and steering with it.  Car went from 90 to zero in an amazingly short distance, and the airbags never deployed, apparently because the impact was below the sensors.\n\nAnother non-deer was a large raccoon I couldn't avoid, and at least didn't hit with the wheels.  That sucker took out my muffler and so I sounded like a hooptie until I could limp the unit back to the shop.\n\nA third was a massive white hairy dog, a Samoyed, I believe, that hit me--I didn't hit it.  I was sitting stationary in a nice lady's driveway running stationary radar with a handheld unit* when a very fit female jogger ran by with her enormous white dog tagging along off leash.  I was distracted from the leash law violation by the very fit female jogger.  My distraction was rudely interrupted when the enormous white dog plowed head long into the side of my patrol car, square in the passenger side door.  Rocked the entire car.  Sucker dented it pretty good, too.  Gave me a good excuse to get the very fit female jogger's name and number, and while she turned out to be engaged to another very lucky man it did serve to save me an ass chewing from my Sergeant when he didn't initially buy my story about how my car got dented until he called the VFFJ and she backed up the account.\n\nHer dog wasn't too bright.\n\nSimilar to the dog, one that WAS a deer happened on the day I had just picked up a brand new patrol unit from fleet shops.  The black and white was so new it hadn't even had the radar mounted in it yet.  I'm cruising through town in my shiny new ride and BAM, the car lurches from an impact in the left rear.  WTF?  Turned out to be a deer that ran through the bank drive thru and smack into the side of my car, leaving a nice dent in the quarter panel.  \n\nPeople think being a cop is dangerous because of felons and gunfire, and rightly so.  I'm also worried about the four legged risks, though, because if experience is any indicator, they're more likely to ruin your shift without warning.\n\nSo help me feel better about all this damn paperwork for my stove in headlight and tell me some of your horror stories about deer or other critters.  I'd prefer the ones where the damn things don't survive the encounter, because the bastard buck that killed my headlight just sauntered off like wiping out a Dodge Charger was all in a routine evening.  Shoulda shot the fucker on general principles, but then the Game Wardens would probably give me shit.\n\nTL;DR:  Fuck deer. \n\n*She'd called in the complaint of speeders on her street, so my Sergeant thought it would be good community relations to not only handle the complaint but use her driveway to do it so she knew we took it seriously, and she gave her permission.  I didn't usually hang out in folks driveways or private property.  Only if they were really nice little old ladies who brought me cookies for slowing down the high school kids running late to school.\n\nEdited for clarity.",

        "text": "Mmmm Background: I'd been working my campus security position for about a year when this happened. So I wasn't totally new to things but still far from \"experienced.\"\n\nAlso, wall o' text warning! \n---------------\n\nJanuary. In the Midwest. At night. Windy. Oh, and did I mention there's snow?\n\nYeah, it's colder than a witch's tits. Even with wool socks, ECWS underlayer, my uniform, a heavy-ass parka and a wool ski cap, I was definitely not a happy camper finishing up my third patrol for the night, sometime around 0100. Looked at the thermometer on the outside of a building. -16F, and that definitely didn't include windchill. FUUUUUUUU\n\nOur campus was essentially split into two sections: The north was all admin buildings, classrooms, etc. The dorms (3 buildings in total) were south of those. Thankfully it was a small school, however, so it didn't take long to walk around the entire perimeter. It also meant I could hear one of the dorm fire alarms going off from all the way across campus. By the sound of things, it was coming from one of the two-story, shared room dorms.\n\nI jogged up there, thankfully without smelling any smoke, as the first bleary-eyed students were wandering out into the cold clutching blankets or coats. Most just seemed confused, until the Resident Assistant (known as Joe in this particular came SPRINTING up to me, waving his arms.\n\n\"IT'S FLOODING! OH GOD, THERE'S WATER EVERYWHERE!!!\"\n\nIf there's a facial expression to emphasize the phrase \"wut\", I'm sure I was wearing it then. \n\nJoe had apparently lost his mind and was running around and screaming. Okay, so he's useless. What now? I grabbed the person who seemed most awake and told them to usher everyone into the next dorm over so they wouldn't die from hypothermia/frostbite/whateverthefuck was in the building.\n\nNow here's an important thing about this dorm: It was shaped like an I, with the long ends facing north and south. Well clearly, whoever had built it had been the lowest builder, because the north end sloped *ever* so slightly downhill. \n\nI walk into the main lobby and look down the south hallway. Lots of open doors, but no fire. Can't smell anything either. So I look the other way.\n\nSix inches of water on the floor and rising quick, past the electrical outlets. This scenario has suddenly turned into a shit sandwich. \n\nI ran back outside and grabbed Joe, who at this point who had gained back some semblance of sanity. \n\n\"Nobody goes in or out of that building without my go-ahead, or someone else wearing a badge, got it?\"\n\nHe nods and mumbles something to an affirmative so I whip out my phone and head back inside, going upstairs to make sure everyone else had gotten out. My first call was to the fire department, since they were the only ones who could shut off the alarm. Dispatch wanted me to stay on the line until I explained that 1) nobody was dead and 2) other people needed a phone call too.\n\nAfter calling my boss, the maintenance crew, dean of student services, and a buddy who I worked with to provide crowd control and help once the FD showed up.\n\nSpeak of the devil...\n\nAbout ten minutes later we get what looks like a full engine company and three cop cars pulling up, lights flashing. I give the responding Sergeant shit for turning our parking lot into a light show and get to work.\n\nTurns out something had tripped one of the fire alarms and in turn the sprinkler. Here's where the fun started: Even though the alarm was shut off, the sprinklers were still going. After confirming the water had tripped an automatic shut-off for the electrical system (which was determined when I accidentally stepped into the possibly electrified water without dying) we made our way down the hall towards a maintenance closet where most of the pipes were located. \n\nThat \"*something*\" turned out to be a gigantic fucking hole in the wall, behind which a large-diameter pipe was spewing water. Said pipe just so happened to be labeled \"sprinkler main\". \n\nThe maintenance guy shouted over at me over the noise of rushing water. \"This one's no good! Main shut-off is in the shed!\"\n\nThree firefighters, the maintenance guy, and myself all book it to the outside of the building. There, we found the small shed where all the uber-important, fuck-all-last-resort valves and shutoffs were located. But the door wouldn't budge. \"Probably frozen,\" one of the FD guys said. \"We'll just force it. Robby, give me a hand.\"\n\nRobby, who looks like he's built out of nothing but muscle and wrought iron, steps up and they both rush the door. This, apparently, was a bad idea. \n\nBecause of the possibility of exposure to the elements, that door had a metric shit-ton of weather proofing around all the edges. This made it harder to open at the best of times, but what also made it so difficult was about six hundred gallons of water pressing on it from the other side. \n\nAs soon as that door finally flew opened, it looked something like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0hq0ug9q4 (But with less...y'know, blood and stuff. And a door, not a whale...you get the idea. I'm a child.)\n\nIf you've never heard two firefighters, a cop, and one rookie security officer all start cursing at the same time as a wave of freezing water soaks them from toe to waist...well, it's a thing of beauty. I'm pretty sure we started making up swear words between chattering teeth. \n\nAfter the water finally drained out, we found our culprit; a solid inch-long, millimeter wide gash in a 3.5\" main line. Maintenance finally shut off the water and broke out the brooms, shopvacs, and towels. Four hours later we had gotten the majority out and left the remainder for the morning crew. \n\nAnd that's when Joe re-appears. Walking up to me as the clock strikes almost nine o' clock in the morning, yawning. \"Man, I'm tired! I only slept like six hours after that alarm went off. How'd your night go?\"\n\nI just walked away knowing it wouldn't be worth the verbal harassment paperwork that would probably follow. ",

        "text": "It's dark, around 8 p.m. one night and I'm sitting at the red light of a major highway on the north edge of my zone. My attention is drawn to car in the turn lane across the intersection from me because I noticed that the driver had opened his door. From my angle, I can see a hand reach down and pick something up off the roadway. Kind of odd, but whatever, maybe he dropped his cigarette. \n\nAs soon as the driver shuts his door, he immediately accelerates through the intersection running the red light. I initiate my lights as he is dipping right into a gas station parking lot.  Taking in my surroundings, I see a female standing beside an SUV parked to the to the front left of us.\n\nThis next part happened in less than 10 seconds.\n\nThe driver is slowing, but not completely stopped when I see the driver side door pop open a couple inches. This is what we like to call \"a clue\" and almost always means I'm about to be in a foot pursuit (or a shoot out). Only reason I say almost is because of this one sole incident out of many where that wasn't true. What else am I suppose to think? Seriously, who does that?\n\nI am preparing to bring my own car to a stop so I can un-ass from the death trap I'm sitting in as I see the driver exit his car, look at me, then direct his attention to the female by the SUV and starts to walk toward her.\n\nI see he has nothing in his hands first and foremost as I start giving verbal commands to step back to his vehicle. I already have my taser turned on, down by my side, ready to go needed. The male then turns, starts walking to me at a steady pace saying, \"this ain't my car, this ain't my car, this ain't my car\"\n\nI'm giving loud verbal commands now, taser pointed, red laser on his torso. Each time I order him to stop, he takes another half step toward me and points back at the car looking confused, \"but this ain't my car....\"\n\nOkay, you've picked a mysterious object up off the road, ran a red light, tried to exit the vehicle while it was still rolling, jump out immediately admitting the car isn't yours, and you're looking at me like *I'm* the idiot?\n\nHe continued toward me, fully aware of the taser pointing at him. The short distance between us was closing, and I'm not okay with that. I give a final command for him to stop, with every intent to pull the trigger on my taser if he didn't immediately comply. He stopped dead in his tracks, dropped his arms and walked back to the vehicle.\n\nMy back up arrived shortly after. I checked the driver for weapons and explained why I stopped him. He tells me that the car belongs to the lady standing next to the SUV, a stranger who's name he does not know. She ran out of gas while waiting for the light to change, and he was in his SUV behind her. He offered to give her a ride across the street to the gas station to refuel a gas can. He then walked the gas can back across the street to fill up her car, while the female stayed with his SUV at the station. I guess giving her a ride back over there in his SUV made too much sense.\n\nI pull up to the intersection just in time to see him picking up the gas cap he had forgot to put back on. He denied that he ran the red light, of course, but what's new. Even if he didn't run it, he still violated improper lane usage because he was in the turn lane, but went straight.\n\nI can't remember what I wrote him for, but I believe I only cited him for one violation. After I had explained to him how things looked from my point of view, he lightened up a little and said that his brother was a State Trooper and that he understood.\n\nTwo days later, I here my name come from the supervisors office requesting I come speak to him. When I walk in he shuts the door, so of course I'm thinking well, crap, what have I done now.\n\nHe informs me that a citizen had filed a complaint on me and reminds me of the traffic stop from a couple nights prior. \"Okkayy, what was the complaint?\"\n\n\"He said that you were way *too aggressive* and that it should be addressed and corrected because being too aggressive in some situations may get someone hurt.\"\n\nI couldn't help it, I started laughing. My supervisor smiled, forcing back a laugh. \"What!!? Are you kidding me? Please tell me you've watched the video\".\n\nI'm a female. 23 years old (at the time), 5 foot 4 inches, 120 pounds soaking wet, and while I do have the certain grit and moxie I need to make it in this job, by nature I am very friendly, approachable, and have a generally sweet disposition. I've gotten in trouble for things, but being too aggressive was never one of them. \n\nI never cussed at him, I never threatened him, I never even touched him other than a pat down to check for weapons. When you've already given me a few red flags then refuse to stop walking towards me when I tell you to, I can only respond to what you've given me to work with. Until the day we can read minds, those actions will be perceived as a quickly approaching dangerous situation. \n\nI think about things like this when people find out I'm an officer and feel the need to share their \"cop that was an ass\" to them story. I take it with a grain of salt. Sometimes, they just don't understand things through our eyes. I'm fairly certain when this guy tells his story, it's not going to be like the video reflects. He is not going to tell it from my perspective, or an unbias one. There's no telling how many people got to hear about the time that ass hole cop pulled a taser on him just for trying to get gas for a helpless stranger.\n\n\n\nAnd oh, I was cleared of any wrong doing.\n",

        "text": "It was one of those work shifts where you might as well forget being able to relieve your bladder anytime soon.\n\nAbout half way through shift I get sent to check the welfare of an elderly woman that family was unable to get in touch with. She ended up being fine, I told her to call her family and returned to my car to document my encounter and clear off the call.\n\nI'm immediately sent to an animal complaint in reference to a dead dog in front of Burger King on a main road in the city. I make my way there and step out of my vehicle just as the rain starts coming down. I locate the dog on a grassy area off the road and see that someone has wrapped it in a blue blanket. I squemishly danced around for a minute trying to talk myself into scooping this thing up and putting it in my car to get it out of public view.\n\nI get the dog to my back seat and lay him down. The collar gives me no information on who he might belong to. He was a well kept miniature schnauzer and I was sure the owners would be looking for him. Then I saw something that caught my eye. Wrapped inside the blanket with the dog was a folded sheet of paper. I open it and read a very heartfelt letter from the woman who found the dog. It read in part something like this:\n\n\"The car in front of me ran over your dog so I stopped to see if there was anything I could do. I am so sorry he did not make it, but I want you to know that I wrapped him in a blanket and held him, he was not cold or alone in his last moments. I am crying as I write this, and am so so sorry. My information is below, please call me and let me know if he is returned to you.\"\n\nCall me a sap, but after all the bad crap I see in this job, I make an extra effort to stop and soak up those awesome moments of pure selfless humanity, no matter how small.\n\nI put the letter back and start driving to a remote area where we often dispose of deceased animals. I get a half mile down the road when Dispatch announces a Robbery in progress at a local restaurant. The offender was just leaving the scene in an orange PT Cruiser. Now I'm no expert in committing crimes but I'm pretty sure knowing not to drive a bright orange get away vehicle is pretty much the criminal equivalent of a kindergarten grade class.\n\n\"Hold on little buddy....\" I say to the dead dog still in my back seat as I flipped my car around and activate my code equipment. I get to the restaurant and officers on scene seem to have it under control, so I decide to check for the orange car which couldn't have gotten far.\n\nWithin a few minutes, my supervisor keys up on the radio sounding excited and informs Dispatch he is behind the orange PT Cruiser and attempting to stop it, but they are speeding up and attempting to flee.\n\nI whip my car back around and punch it knowing this kind of situation could escalate quickly and he needed some back up. A couple of other officers headed his way as well and the pursuit was on.\n\nWe go up one street down another over speed bumps, swinging corners, but they won't stop. After about five minutes, the driver of the orange car turned on a street that was in the shape of a horseshoe. Knowing there were only two ways in and out, one of the officers went to the other entrance and we converged on him from both ways somewhere in the middle. He knew he was done for and pulled into a driveway.\n\nSirens blaring, lights flashing, officers advancing, yelling verbal commands...we see the driver of the orange car put a Crack pipe to his mouth and light it up for one last draw of his drug. Sure! Why not? What's one more felony.\n\nWe get him hooked up after slight resistance from the driver and begin doing what we need to do to investigate the robbery he was suspected of committing. Of course he starts faining distress and chest pain so we call an ambulance. He opts to be transported to the hospital and an officer is sent to stay with him until he is released. \n\nI stay busy at the scene helping officers for about an hour, when my supervisor tells me to go to the hospital and meet with the other officer. He had ridden in the ambulance and didn't have a car, so I would need to transport him to the jail after being cleared by the doctor.\n\nI get to the hospital and am surprised to hear that he will be discharged very soon. The doctor on duty had a very nonchalant \"ehhh, he smoked a lil crank, he'll be alright\" kind of attitude. We get the discharge papers and exit the ER for his free ride to lock up. \n\nI open the back door of my patrol car and immediately slam it back shut. I motion to the officer to step over and talk to me in private.\n\nMe: Umm.. *laughs*... there's a dead dog in my back seat. I totally forgot til just now.\n\nThe officer gave me a look that indicated he did not find this as mildly comical as I did. He walks to the opposite side of the Patrol Car and I keep the offender distracted in conversation while he attempts to figure out what to do with the dog.\n\nThere really wasn't much we could do and concealed the dog best we could in the floorboard of the back seat.\n\nNot gonna lie, it crossed my mind to leave it on the seat just for the \"WTF\" conversation it surely would of prompted from the cracked out felon.\nLuckily, he never noticed. We dropped him off at the Jailhouse Inns and Suites, and headed back to the station to begin our mound of paperwork from the Robbery and other calls of the day.\n\nBy the time I got back to the city, it was past quitting time and I was exhausted. Dispatch calls me as I'm pulling in to the station and tells me they believe they have the owners of the deceased dog on the phone. We confirmed the dog was theirs and I had the dispatcher tell them I would come by their house within the hour. \nI pull up at there home with another officer and see a Mom, Dad, and two kids around the age of 12 standing outside. The young daughter was red faced and sobbing, obviously distraught at the news of her dog dying. I was already emotionally spent that day. I asked the other officer to please take her the dog. \n\nStill wrapped in a blue blanket with the note tucked inside, he returned the schnauzer to the sobbing family for a proper burial. \n\nI went back to the police department and sat in my car riding out the tail end of the days emotional roller coaster. I pulled out my notebook and looked at the email address I had written down of the girl who left the information on the letter.\n\nI typed up a short email, letting her know that the dog had made it home and that I was certain the family deeply appreciated her kindness. I thanked her for what she did, and that I wished there were more kind hearted souls like her. \n\nIt had been a good (hard) but good day. Exciting pursuit, a Robber locked away, and a Schnauzer was given one heck of an adventure before being returned and laid to rest.\n\nAnd that was only the last half of shift.\n\n",

        "text": "*Not actual names of those involved*\n\nI am awoken by a phone call one morning around 10 a.m from a woman who identified herself as \"Elizabeth\" calling from a business name I didn't catch in my half asleep state.\n\nShe asked if she could speak to Jenny, which was my name. This struck me as odd because that is my nickname and only used by close friends. All associations I have otherwise I use my formal name Jennifer. I am a very hard sleeper and not 100% with it when I am abruptly awoken. As soon as she said her name was Elizabeth, I immediately thought of the crazy ex girlfriend of the guy I was dating. I didn't know for sure if it was her, but was too tired to find out if it was so I told her she had the wrong number to avoid any drama starting. She apologized, we disconnected.\n\nWhen I woke up for the day a couple hours later, the phone call really got me wondering. I googled the number and it returned to a medical clinic in my town (we'll call it Hometown Medical for story telling purposes).\n\nWorried that a friend of mine had been at the clinic and listed me as a contact because they needed something, I immediately called the the number back. A woman answered the phone and the following conversation ensued.\n\nElizabeth: \"Hometown Medical Clinic this is Elizabeth how may I help you?\"\n\nMe: \"Yes, this is Jenny. I received a call from here a couple hours ago from someone asking for me but I was half asleep and believe I told them they had the wrong number\"\n\nElizabeth: Yes, that was me, I apologize I dialed the wrong number by accident.\n\n***My Cop-dar immediately throws up a red flag***\n\nMe: \"Umm, sooo.... you were trying to reach someone named Jenny but dialed the wrong number and somehow got ahold of someone else with the same name?\"\n\nElizabeth: \"Haha! Yea I guess so!\"\n\nShe seemed very professional and pleasant, but I wasn't buying it. I really started to believe it was the ex-girlfriend and she was up to something.\n\nMaybe a normal person would just say oh well, and leave it at that. But as a police officer, my mind would not let it rest and I wanted to know who this was, why they called, then felt the need to lie about dialing the wrong number.\n\nI get ready for work, and head to briefing. Luckily, the medical clinic just happened to be in the zone I was assigned to that day. As soon as I was free, I drove to the clinic and did some snooping. I monitor the general activity and flow of patients, run some tags, and park my car to keep on eye on the place for a few minutes. \n\nA vehicle parked at the side begins to raise my suspicions. It was occupied by two males who were just sitting there, and had been for several minutes with no apparent intentions of getting out. Both of them were slightly turned and looking down at the middle console. The driver appeared to be manipulating something on the console that I couldn't see. My inital thought was it looked as if they were rolling a joint or counting pills, but I couldnt be for sure. I run the tag and it returns with the registered owner having quite the extensive felonious record. They now have my undivided attention.\n\nSeconds later, Dispatch Says my call sign on the radio sending me to an address about a mile away, followed by, \"Be enroute for a domestic, shooting in progress\". \n\nCrap, just my luck. I clear my mind of all its recent thoughts and now focus on the emergency situation I am running code to get to.\n\nThe shooting was a real doozy and kept me busy for several hours. I arrest the shooter, carry him to the police dept and begin working on the mound of paperwork required for the arrest. I head to the break room later on and grab a snack to munch on. I'm  relaxing in a chair taking a short break when Dispatch comes over the radio sending one of the officers to another call.\n\n\"10-4, Be enroute to a Robbery in progress. 123 Main Street, Hometown Medical.\"\n\nI jumped up out of my chair almost knocking it over. I realized I couldn't go because I had a prisoner, but was dying to get ahold of my supervisor to tell him something was up with this place, but I didn't know exactly what.\n\nI pull the call on my computer and see that the callers name is \"Elizabeth Smith\". Now that I knew the last name, I realized exactly who the mystery caller from this morning was.\n\nA year prior, Elizabeth lived next door to me at my apartment complex. She was nothing but trouble and I soon realized she was a very manipulative con artist. She is one of those unique individuals who are able to appear professional, well kept, meek, and innocent but was everything opposite. She used those chameleon qualities to manipulate her way through life, stealing money and checks from her employers and men she would lure in and date. She also loved to use a \"I have cancer\" sob story which I know wasn't true. (*I was the Courtesy officer at the complex. My phone number was available to all the residents and were allowed to call me to handle noise complaints and what not. This is likely how she had my number*)\n\nShe had moved out around 10 months prior and I hadn't heard from or seen her since. Not that I expected to, we were only neighbors.\n\nI still didn't have a clue what was going on, but I had a pretty strong hunch that the two men I had seen parked in the parking lot had something to do with it. As soon as I can, I relay that information to the supervisor on scene at the robbery, and give him the full run down of the phone call from earlier that day.\n\nTo make a long story short, the two men I had seen turned out to in fact be the offenders from the robbery. I was able to supply the tag with one of the names and being able to say that I had in fact seen them at that business helped secure a warrant for their arrest. I would have never gone to that business and been able to supply that information had it not been for the mysterious phone call.\n\nI still wonder what she would have said if I hadn't of told her she had the wrong number. Guess I'll never know.\n\n--------Additional Reading Pertaining to This Call------\n\nElizabeth was brought in to be interviewed and said that she knew one of the offenders because of recognizing his voice (they had on masks). They had apparently robbed the clinic because the doctor had recently cracked down on writing erroneous prescriptions for narcotics. When the offenders couldn't get their pills, they robbed the business instead. Which kind of makes no sense because it's not a pharmacy, all they stole was money. They probably did it mostly out of anger.\n\nElizabeth had a personal relationship with one of the men, but attempted to minimize her interactions with him as more of an acquaintance. I am not sure what role she played in the robbery or how much she knew, but she definitely wasn't an innocent victim. \n\nI pressed the detective to ask her why she had called me that morning. Elizabeth claimed she was trying to call her babysitter Jenny to check on her daughter and clicked the wrong Jenny in her phone list when she looked up the number to call on the business land line.\n\nBullshit, lies. Who in the heck calls who they believe is their babysitter... someone they trust enough to watch their child and begins the conversation with the impersonal \"Hey this is Elizabeth from Hometown Medical\". No body, that's who. You'd say, \"hey its elizabeth, just calling to see if Lillie Mae is behaving\" or maybe even not say your name at all because I'm pretty sure the baby sitter knows you enough to tell who is calling...and that's assuming they don't have caller ID. \n\nShe never did give an alternate explanation. \n\nThe detectives speculated that Elizabeth knew they were going to be robbed and was scared. So she called me, a cop she knew, to tip me off. Sounds plausible, but there's an issue with that too. Again, why did she call me and say \"this is Elizabeth from hometown medical\"? Instead of, \"Hey, this is Elizabeth that use to live beside you at Lingo Apartment Complex\". Also, she had a perfectly good working cell phone. Why would she call from a land line in the middle of a doctor's office with patients who would over hear her talking about the place possibly getting robbed.\n\nFurthermore, her 12 year old daughter was present when the robbery took place. Personally, I'd keep my kid far far away and at home with the baby sitter if I believed something bad might happen soon. Not only did they steal money, they also pistol whipped the doctor.\n\nJust one of those things that make ya wonder.",

        "text": "“This one?” I whispered to Biggs.\n\n“Yeah, dummy. That one.”\n\nI took a deep inhale through my nose, trying to register the smell of burning marijuana that Biggs had detected several yards earlier on our tour of the hotel floor. Nope. I shook my head at him with an exaggerated expression of defeat.\n\nBiggs rolled his eyes. We listened to the door a moment, our ears both registering some plucky commercial music from the TV as well as a low voice and some female giggling.\n\nBiggs stepped back and looked to George. He waved him forward, indicating to him he should do the knocking. George edged up and listened a second himself before knocking.\n\nThe giggles stopped and we heard the soft padding of someone approaching the door. Biggs and I had taken a post on either side of the door frame while George placed himself nicely in the peep-hole’s view, sporting a cheeky grin. \n\n“Police!” He said, in a chipper tone.\n\nThe door cracked to the point the chain lock would allow it and the sudden waft of marijuana odor assaulted my previously inept sense of smell. “What is it?” The man who spoke had a low voice and a thick accent, seemingly of African origin.\n\n“No smoking room.” George answered.\n\n“I’m not smoking.” The man grunted back.\n\n“Smells like a lie to me!” Biggs and I shared a glance conveying neither of us were impressed by George’s wit. “How ‘bout we come in, have a look around, if there’s nothing to it we won’t have you kicked out or fined by the manager. He sent us up here, by the way.”\n\nThe man hesitated at the door, breathing heavy through his mouth for several beats. Biggs had his fill rather quickly. He stepped out from his point of concealment and addressed the occupant.\n\n“Look dude. Management wants us to check. Either we come in and do a quick once over or you refuse and after you get the $500 fine and kicked out we take you to jail for obstruction and trespassing on top of it.”\n\nThe man sighed, then closed the door.\n\n“Really? Really!” Biggs threw his hands in the air in exasperation.\n\n“Morris. We’re going to need the caller up here. No-go at the door.” I stepped away from the door and said into my radio.\n\n“Ok. On our way.”\n\n“Great.” Biggs said. “Y’hear that? There goes the rest of the weed.” The toilet flushed inside the room and we could hear people frantically but silently scurrying about.\n\n“I knew we should’ve done the house keeping thing.” George said.\n\n“Shut up, that never works.” Biggs replied, still fuming at the loss of potential misdemeanor stats. “Sounds like they just opened the window.”\n\n“Hope they jump.” I added dryly. We were on the sixth floor.\n\nA minute later Morris arrived with the manager in tow. “I knew I smelled something, just didn’t know which room.” He said as he approached, pulling a master key from his front pocket. “We have a smoking floor, for God’s sake. Why these people insist on smoking in the non-smoking rooms…” He trailed off as he handed the key to Biggs.\n\n“He’s using the chain lock.” I mentioned, before Biggs put the key card into the lock.\n\n“Whatever, you can break it. I’m going to have to get maintenance up here tonight to deodorize anyway. I would just like you all to get them out of there so we can get started please.” We had a good relationship with this hotel and their no-smoking policy backed by management who actually “evicted” occupants for violating it had led to several decent cases for my team. “I’ll stand back here until you make sure they’re not dangerous, I know the drill.” The manager crossed his arms and leaned against the wall.\n\nThe light on the lock turned green as Biggs pulled the card out. \n\n“Police here, with the manager. Keep your hands where I can see them.” The chain caught as it had before. “You gonna unlock this or make your bill bigger to cover fixing it when I kick the door in?”\nThere was no answer.\n\n“This guy…” Biggs said, then stepped back and kicked the door, popping the chain from the frame. The door swung open and Biggs motioned to his breast pocket then nodded to me. I realized he was reminding me to fire up my camera pen – a recent gadget I had picked up and something we were trying to implement on cases like this where consent and articulation could be called into question later. I pressed the button to start recording.\n\nWe drew our weapons in case we were walking into an ambush and slowly entered. Biggs covered the bathroom just inside and I edged to his side, George and Morris behind us. I spotted the man from the door sitting on one of the queen beds. Two females sat on the other one.\n\n“What the hell, man?” I asked, holstering up once I saw their empty hands. Morris and George swept the rest of the room and Biggs came in too. “That should’ve been much easier.”\n\n“I’m not smoking.” The man said, ignoring the haze still lingering even with the open window.\n\n“Maybe not now, but you were.” Biggs said, scrutinizing the desk and end tables. He reached down and pinched some ash between his fingers. “What’s this?” He ground his fingers together causing the ash to float in the breeze from the window.\n\n“Don’t know.” The man said. He was sweating but stone faced.\n“Whose room?” George asked.\n\nThe man glanced at the girls on the bed next to him. “I’m just here for business.”\n\nBiggs inspected the two females for a second. “Business?” The girls were doing their best to not look guilty. “Business? Or *business*?”\n“I sell tickets. For planes. They want to travel.” The man said in a flat tone.\n\n“Sure ya do. Plaid shirt-“ Biggs called to the girl closer to him, wearing a button-up plaid shirt, “-come out in the hallway real quick.” She complied reluctantly. Clearly we were working with some prostitution issues here and Biggs would be able to get a closer-to-reality story from the girl in private. The other two remained sitting on the beds, watching a muted MTV reality show.\n\n“Anything illegal in here? Any more weed?” George asked.\n\n“No, nothing. You can look.” The remaining female said. George immediately picked up a purse, opened it, chortled, and pulled out a handful of condoms.\n\n“Business?” He asked and was ignored.\n\nBiggs made a grand re-entrance a moment later. “We’re good for prostitution charges. I need some IDs.” He held his hand out and the two females scoffed in annoyance while they searched their belongings for something with their information on it. The man sat still.\n\nBiggs collected the girls licenses then looked at the man expectantly. “Nothing bro?”\n\n“I have no ID.” He said to the TV.\n\n“We’re going to play this game?”\n\n“It’s not a game. I have no ID.” The man refused to break his gaze from the bikini-clad host of whatever spring break dreck MTV was airing. Biggs found the remote and flipped the TV off. He handed the girl’s IDs to Morris to check for warrants and pulled out his notebook.\n\n“Name?”\n\n“My name?” The man asked, suddenly interested in our line of questioning.\n\n“No, mine.” Biggs scoffed. “Of course yours!”\n\n“Oh. Um… my name is John.”\n\n“Jooooohn….”\n\n“Johnson?” The man added.\n\nBiggs’ shoulders slacked in aggravation. “Birthday?”\n\n“April… 10th?” The man said. “I don’t remember.” He waved his hand as if his answer was routine. Biggs’ pen hovered over his notebook and his gaze hovered over the man’s head.\n\n“Your birthday was two days ago and you don’t remember?” I asked.\n\n“Yes.” The man grunted.\n\nBiggs shook his head then scribbled into his notebook. “Year?”\n\nThe man turned from the TV’s blank screen again but didn’t reply.\n“MORRIS!” Biggs yelled over his shoulder. “Run this guy, wildcard on the DOB year. We’re a little confused over here.” He handed the torn out sheet from his notebook over, then glared at the man some more. “So, John Johnson. This is what we’re going with? Not gonna be good for you when we don’t get a return. Care to give your real info over?”\n\nThe man ignored him, instead concentrating on the TV once again. Everyone in the room waited in silence for Morris’s return.\n\n“Girls are no wants, history of prostitution. This guy is a ghost. What’s your name dude?” Morris tried to crack the tough customer we were dealing with another non-reply for his efforts.\n\nBiggs looked to me and I nodded back. We had run into this situation before and knew the quickest way to resolve it.\n\n“Ok!” Biggs clapped his hands. “Girls: pack your stuff. Management wants you out. No hotel room for the night but no arrest either, cool?” The girls sighed with relief and immediately began grabbing bags and stuffing clothing into them.\n\n“Mr. Johnson!” Biggs turned to the sweaty mute. “You sir have to provide some form of identification so we can let you go on a summons for soliciting a prostitute or for obstructing justice, haven’t made up my mind yet. If you’re unable to do so, we’re going to have to take you to jail and fingerprint you. Give me something so that I can verify you are who you say you are and this will be done in a few minutes.”\n\nThe man pondered the scenario in wide-eyed silence before making up his mind. “My name is Chris.”\n\n“Gonna need some more…” Morris urged.\n\n“Chris Jones.” The man told us as he watched the two girls make their hasty escape into the hallway.\n\n“Birthday? Driver’s license number? Social security?” Morris was waiting for the info, pen to paper.\n\nThe man just shrugged.\n\n“Ok! Jail time, let’s go!” Biggs and George pulled him up, unresisting, by his armpits and spun him around, deftly clicking the cuffs into place. George began a search of his pockets while Biggs lectured.\n\n“I get you’re embarrassed with the whole hooker thing, but we’re not here to ruin your life. This could’ve been easy. Now Morris over there is going to have to drive you to jail to fingerprint you-”\n\nMorris dejectedly dropped his arms to his side. “Heeeeey…”\n\n“-and we’re going to have a lot more paperwork because you’re too stupid to know a good thing when you see one.”\n\n“Wallet!” George called out. He flipped it open and pulled out a driver’s license. “Mr… Williams?”\n\nBiggs grabbed the ID from George. “Mike Williams? How many generic sounding names do you have?”\n\n“Well, here’s another: Christopher Smith!” George handed Biggs another license, the same somewhat serious photo of out mystery man accompanying it.\n\n“Oh man, you’re so screwed.” Biggs laughed.\n\n“And two, three, four… five credit cards with variations on all these names! Bingo!!” George was getting excited.\n\n“I guess we can forego the jail for now. Morris!” Biggs called. “Take Mr. Whoever to the station. We’ll call out a detective and let them sort this out.”\n\nIt took a couple hours to get a detective to the station and sort out exactly who we were dealing with. It turned out our guy was an illegal immigrant from Sierra Leone who was making a living creating identities with stolen social security numbers. At one point, once he finally started talking, he admitted one of the reasons he didn’t give us his name was due to the fact he couldn’t remember which ID he was clean under. He had been issued tickets in several of his pseudonyms and somehow managed to avoid any serious trouble for about five years. Although we couldn’t come up with a good address for him specifically, several of his fake identities had ties to a nearby apartment. My team went there the next day to do some digging.\n\nIt was rather uneventful.\n\nIn the end, we determined the occupant was a former girlfriend. She didn’t provide enough information to further our case but in the end, it wasn’t a big deal anyway. Mystery Man was charged on the federal level and held by immigration for deportation. He took a plea at his first opportunity, about six months after we arrested him.\nThe team chalked the event up to a job well done and overall it didn’t really stick out as anything special. That changed almost three years later with the fateful delivery of a federal subpoena to appear in Civil Court, answering to charges of blatantly maliciously disregarding the civil rights of one of our fine citizens.\n\n**TO BE CONTINUED**",

        "text": "A little background: I used to be a shift sergeant in a small town PD in the south. Our town was small, upper-middle class, generally well educated, and the only gas station closed at 11pm. The only place that served alcohol was a Mexican restaurant that closed at 10pm. Needless to say, not much happened on 3rd shift and most nights, there were only two of us on duty. This particular night, my partner Mike (not his real name) and I are covering the town’s two districts.\n\nAround 1am, Mike and I were sitting in our patrol cars, window to window, next to the Mexican place, soaking up the free wi-fi. This spot was perfect, since it had clear lines of sight to run RADAR in both directions on the main road through town and happened to have unsecured high-speed internet. \n\nDispatch covers half our county, including us, a few other small towns, and half of the Sheriff’s Office’s coverage area. The dispatcher comes over the radio with “Does any unit know of a location in their district called Heart Attack Hill?” Mike and I look at each other knowingly and I respond to dispatch, letting them know we have a small road in our town affectionately known by that name. Dispatch then relays a request for police response stating the caller was a little frantic and she couldn’t really get an accurate description of what had happened. Mike and I pull out of the parking lot and head toward Heart Attack Hill. \n\nWe let dispatch know we are in the area and begin searching for the caller. A few minutes later we come upon a 19 y/o male, who we’ll call Jogger, laying in the grass in front of a house. As we get closer, we can see he’s a little beat up, scratches and red marks on his arms and legs. He’s still breathing heavy and is seriously shaken up. \n\nJogger tells us he’s home from college and staying with his parents when he decided to go for a run. As he’s coming back up Heart Attack Hill, a small buck took offense to Jogger's presence in its territory and attacked him out of the blue. Jogger says the deer hit him, without warning, right in the hip, knocking him into the grass. The deer then charged the now supine runner, scratching his arms with its antlers before deciding it had won the day. The deer took off into the woods, leaving the shaken Jogger trying to figure out exactly what had just happened.\n\nWe request response from the medics and it goes something like this:\n\nMe: Can I get medical to respond for a 19 y/o male, hit by a deer\n\nDispatch: Copy, do you need a tow truck?\n\nMe: Negative, he was on foot.\n\nDispatch: Say again?\n\nMe: Victim was on foot, he was hit by a deer while jogging\n\nDispatch: (pause)… copy. \n\nTown FD usually sends a truck with 2 guys for medical calls after midnight, along with the county paramedics who have a station nearby. For some reason, the whole shift and two fire trucks showed up for this one along with the county ambulance. \n\nJogger turns out to be fine, aside from a couple bruises, a crazy story to take back to school, and a new found fear of nature. Mike gives him a ride home after he is cleared by medical and I head back to the station to type up one of the most ridiculous reports of my 11 year career. \n",

        "text": "A woman called from out of state and requested police check on her father who had recently made suicidal threats. She explained that he has long been retired, but had a full and extensive military career, and may be suffering from depression. She is now unable to make contact with him and relays his address to Dispatch to have officers check his welfare.\n\nWe pull up near his house which is at the dead end of a road situated with a couple of other houses spaced a good ways apart at the top of a \"mountain\". The houses are surrounded by a large wooded forest with various hiking trails. \n\nThe other officer and I first check the perimeter and look for any dangers or signs that something was amiss. We find nothing out of the ordinary and ring the door bell to see if he is home. A check of the door confirmed it was locked and secure. After knocking and announcing ourself numerous times with no answer, we have Dispatch relay our negative findings to his daughter.\n\nHis daughter was not satisfied with leaving it at that and stressed that something had to be wrong. Her father was very much a home body and didn't venture out of the house often. She requested that I look in the garage to see if the two vehicles he owned were in there. She told me the make, model, and color of both vehicles. One was a very nice, but not uncommon Toyota or Acura type vehicle. The other was what I can safely assume was his pride and joy- an old, rarer, classic muscle car.\n\nI couldnt see into the garage because the windows were too high up,  so I check the door leading into the garage just in case. I gave it a push, and it opens. I signal to the other officer and notify Dispatch that we would be entering the residence due to finding an unsecured door.\n\nAs soon as we enter the garage, I see the two exact cars she told me should be there. I get a sinking feeling in my stomach as my experience told me it was likely we were about to find her father either in serious need of medical attention or dead.\n\nGuns drawn, we start moving through the house. The house was HUGE,  three stories tall, and several thousand square feet. It took us 20 or more minutes to finish systematically clearing each room. Every second of it expecting to round the corner and find her father in some state of distress. But we found nothing. Lights were off, no sign that he was currently home. We also went back through the entire home re-checking rooms and examining things closer to see if we could find a suicide note or clue about where he might be. Nothing.\n\nHis daughter pushed harder for us to do more. I had Dispatch transfer her to my cell phone so I could speak with her personally and ask more questions. Her voice sounded panicked, and genuinely concerned. She told me again of his recent suicide threats and said that he sometimes goes walking on the hiking trails on the mountain right across from his home. She asked again about the cars and I told her they were both there.\n\nAt this point, the sun was starting to set and it felt like this was turning in to a wild goose chase. I felt uneasy, and expressed to the now two other officers on scene with me that I had a bad feeling about this. I felt so uneasy I opted to bring my patrol rifle with me on the \"hike\". We enter the woods, it's really getting dark. We wind down the path calling his name, hear nothing, see nothing. \n\nThen, all of the sudden, we all hear something and come to a stop. It's someone yelling, but we can't quite make out what they're saying. Whoever it was, was no where near us so we continued deeper into the woods. We hear the males voice yell 5 or 6 more times over a several minute span. We weren't sure, but all agreed it sounded like they were yelling \"Bob\". When we yelled back, there would be no response. We keep walking, but get no closer to the sound and eventually decide that it has to be coming from another subdivision at the bottom of the mountain, possibly a man calling for his dog or kids playing some game of tag. The direction, sound, and volume of the voice seemed to be originating in that subdivision (which we could see just beyond the tree line). It didn't at all sound like it was coming from the trails further into the woods.\n\nWe hadnt heard any more voices or yelling for several minutes and no longer concerned that it was someone inside the woods calling for help, we hike out and, back to our cars. I ask the dispatcher to tell his daughter we did all we could, but right now there's nothing further we can do. Just out of curiosity, I have the dispatcher ask her if she knew anyone named \"Bob\". The dispatcher reports back to me that yes, Bob is a very close family friend of theirs. This freaks me out, big time. But I remind myself that Bob is quite a common name and that the yelling was so far away, we're not even sure that is what was being yelled.\n\nI document our adventure, clear from the call and get the heck out of there. Something just didn't set right with me. Not the normal kind of doesn't set right with me feeling that usually makes me investigate harder, I was just purely spooked.\n\nI get out of the neighborhood and meet up with another officer to shoot the breeze. Less than 10 minutes later, Dispatch calls....\n\nDispatch: hey, just wanted to update you. The daughter called back and said that everything is fine, she got ahold of her father.\n\nMe: oh okay cool, where was he?\n\nDispatch: she said he was at home\n\nMe: Oh did he just get home or something?\n\nDispatch: nooo, she said that he was home the whole time and that yall went to the wrong address. He told her that he had seen yall parked outside going in and out of his neighbors house.\n\nI slapped my hand to my forehead and for a split second thought, wow good job officer idiot. Really screwed that one up.\n\nThen the wave of uneasy flooded back over me and I said:\nMe: Umm, Shay... we were in the right house. She told me what two cars would be in the garage and they were there. Not to mention, I saw pill bottles and mail in the kitchen with his name and address on it. We were in that house, he wasn't there.\n\nDispatcher: I told her the same thing about the cars.  She blew it off and said her dad told her he was in his living room the whole time watching yall through the window and wondering what was going on over at his neighbors. \n\nWe were in the right house. There were no TVs, radios, or lights on inside. We were never at his neighbors house. He never saw us go anywhere near his neighbor's house, much less in and out of it. \n\nLet's pretend me and my partner are just that crappy at clearing houses and both missed a man sitting  right there in his living room. 1.] He would have definitely saw us in his house and didn't bother to say \"excuse me can I help you?\" 2] Why did he lie about see us going in and out of his neighbors house? \n\nI don't know what military training that man put to use or where his secret observing room was, but he punked us good and it still gives me the creeps. \n\n\n\n",

        "text": "  Today has been a particularly long, trying day. I've recently spent a lot of time reflecting on the hatred and harsh judgment those in my career have received and wish more than anything I could make it better. I am an imperfect human being who makes numerous mistakes everyday. I am no better or different than the person standing in front of me in the grocery store. However, I firmly believe that I didn't choose this career, it chose me.\n\n On days like this, sometimes I wish it hadn't. Its difficult seeing the vile, misguided opinions from those who spew their hurtful words from the comfort of their own home as they speak freely and often about things they know very little, if anything, about. \n\n  Four years ago, I was a bright eyed naive rookie, looking forward to the excitement this job had to offer. I look in the mirror now and see that I have aged a little faster than I should have and made heating pads and Goody's powder my best friends because of the damage done to my hips and back from the weight of the vest and gun belt. The vest I wear everyday because of the ever rising risk I might get shot that day. Its a sobering thought, draping the heavy vest over your shoulders and wrapping the velcro straps around your body. A humbling reminder before I even lace up my boots, that today may be my last. Never mind the other numerous ways there are to take my life. Such as knowing how to defend myself from those who choose to fight.\n\n I have seen things no one should ever have to see. I have seen what it looks like the instant life leaves the body, I've smelled the distinctive smell of death. I've seen bodies in person so mangled that CSI wouldn't dare recreate out of fear of traumatizing the public. My every work day is a rollercoaster of emotion impossible to understand unless you live it. I'm constantly switching gears. I've had to go from sitting in a roach infested shack while a child cries and explains heart wrenching details of sexual abuse. Only to then be dispatched to a million dollar home and listen to someone rant for 30 minutes about their neighbors barking dog. Forgive me, please, if I seem a little distracted at that moment. \n\n  I am expected to be tough as nails when I see those horrid things. I have to be ready at any moment to take the life of someone who wishes to take mine. But I also have to be gentle, compassionate lifting an infant off the floor riddled with used syringes filled with methamphetamine residue. I feel the same anger and sickness in my stomach you feel when you hear about it on the news. Probably worse, because I was there. I wish I could yell, cuss, and sometimes punch this person who did that to the little one. But I can't. I have to show restraint. The higher standard I am held to, requires me to be always professional. And forgive me, sometimes I fail. I fail everyday. Most the time my mistake is minor, and causes a slight inconvenience to me or someone else. Sometimes worse. But I constantly keep in mind the difference between my mistakes, and your 8-5 job mistakes.\n\n \n  The people are just waiting for me to fail. You mess up terribly and you might get suspended or fired. I mess up terribly, I might get to re-watch it on the 6 o clock news and relive every horrible moment of it. And sit back as the over abundance of hate comments roll in. The same people I swore to serve and protect. People who may need an officer tomorrow, and I still wouldn't hesitate to help. People who have freedom of speech, but should realize that sometimes, you just might not know everything. People who are so adamant how wrong what you did is. They're horrified by your actions, demanding something be done. But end their contribution to \"helping\" the matter by slandering someone they don't know on a topic they know nothing about and pressing the enter key.\n\n You certainly don't know me. I am the buffer between you and reality. I hold the images of horrific scenes, for you, so you don't have to. I lose the sleep, my body aches, I shed the tears, for you. All of us do. Days like today really hurt my spirit. But I know tomorrow, I will wake up (lord willing) and pull my vest over my head, lace up my boots, and straighten my badge for another roller coaster ride. I will do my best to be what you expect of me. I will constantly strive to maintain the difficult standard I am held to. And if I fail, if I make an inevitable human mistake, I pray you take a moment to reflect on your own mistakes before you publicly past judgment on mine.\n\n What keeps me going is that for every horrible moment, there is an equal and greater moment of fulfilment, from the little things like happiness on the little girls face when I bring home her lost kitten, to the feeling of reward and accomplishment I feel when I put handcuffs on the abuser, the molester, the thief. I know I make a difference everyday. No matter how small. I bear a responsibility many cant or refuse to carry.  My job is not the only hard job there is, but regardless of the negative opinions, I am proud to call myself a police officer.",

        "text": "We deal with dogs a lot. Here's a few encounters I've had. Some will make you hate humanity.\n_______________________\n\nMy beat partner got a call of a terrier mix running on the freeway. He went en route, and I went to help. It's pretty rare that one guy can catch a dog on the freeway. While on our way there, we got a few updates. One of which was that someone saw how the dog got there. Apparently, a car pulled over, opened their door, dropped the dog off, and left. Classy.\n\nMy beat partner (we'll call him Jones) arrived before me. He pulled over to the right shoulder, along with a passing motorist. He went over the radio to me, \"Hey, he got by me. He managed to run from the shoulder to the center divide. Stop traffic so I can try and grab him.\" I let him know that I was doing so.\n\nI slowed traffic to 20 miles per hour before a blind curve, and was about to let him know I was almost at his location. I heard Jones key up to dispatch, \"Car crash, car crash! Vehicle overturned!\" \n\nGood thing I had traffic slowed. I brought traffic in slowly, came around the curve, and saw a Jeep on its roof on the shoulder. I spotted the dog in the middle lane. It wasn't moving. Jones went back to me, \"The dog got hit. It's in the middle lanes if you can clear it before letting traffic go.\" I moved it to the shoulder, and pulled over behind the overturned vehicle. Everyone was fine. I spoke to the driver to figure out what happened.\n\n\"I was just going down the freeway when I saw another car hit a dog. That sent the dog into the air and it was coming right at my windshield. I swerved to avoid it and, well...\" She pointed to the upside-down Jeep. Nobody went home happy out of that one.\n__________________________\n\nI stopped a girl for driving on the shoulder. It was heavy traffic and she didn't feel like waiting her turn. All the windows were completely rolled down when I walked up, and I saw she had a 70lb pitbull mix in her back seat. I notified her why I stopped her, to which she had no excuse, and she let me know it was her first time being stopped. She asked if she'd be getting a ticket. I told her she would. Once I had her information, I walked back to my car to write the ticket.\n\nWhile I was writing, I glanced up to see her get out of her car and run around the back. I gave her a \"What are you doing?\" look. She yelled, \"My dog!\" I looked to the right side of her car and saw the dog sprinting away, down the side of the freeway. Gosh darn it. She tried chasing after it. She wasn't catching it. And while I'm fast, I'm not as fast as a dog.\n\nI got in my car, lights and sirens, and stopped the freeway. The dog stopped, and the driver managed to grab it a good 200 feet down the road.  I yelled to her, \"Can you walk it back?\" She yelled back, \"I can try!\" Well, she couldn't. The dog didn't have a leash or even a collar. I pulled in behind her and went over to help. I tried to pick the dog up, and to make it so much easier, the dog laid down. Thaaaaanks. With a little effort, I picked it up and carried it back to her car for her. Luckily, it was pretty friendly.\n\nShe rolled her windows up once I got the dog inside. She still got a ticket.\n________________________________\n\nAnother dog on the freeway call during rush hour. A second unit was ahead of me and called it out, \"It just went by me. He's running back towards you.\" I stopped on the shoulder and saw a 10lb white ball of fur in full sprint coming towards me. To my right was a solid wall. To my left was the freeway. I tried to funnel the furball towards the wall to trap him. He faked right and went left, well around me, while I stood there wondering how I just got schooled that badly. I went to the other unit, \"Yeah...he just went by me, too. Dude's got moves.\" \n\nA hundred feet behind me, a passerby saw my epic failure and jumped out of their car. At this point the dog had run into some bushes, slowing it down. The passerby was able to grab the dog, who handed it off to me. I transported it to the animal shelter to hopefully be reunited with its owner. But not before it left a present in my car's back seat.",

        "text": "It started off as any other day usually does. I wake up, roll out of bed begrudgingly. Shit, shower, shave... The whole nine yards. I put my uniform on, comb my hair meticulously, brush my teeth, then fight tooth and nail to make sure my duty belt and uniform doesn't make me look fat. You know, A normal start to the day. I drive to work. It's hot as fuck in my car because I'm out of frion and I'm really hoping it doesn't make me sweat because there is this pretty officer I work with, and my meticulously combed hair would just go to waste if i showed up with gorilla pits. As usual, its lazy Sunday roads with no traffic so I get there with enough time to chit-chat with other Officers during briefing. The supervisors walk in one by one and the din of the room begins to die down. My Shift Sergeant begins to amble on about the comings and goings of day-shift. I couldn't help but let my eyes wander to that pretty officer sitting ahead of me...\n\nSuddenly I was pulled out of my thoughts when my name was called and I was assigned to floor support. \"Perfect!\" I thought. \"There couldn't be a better way to end the week.\" Floor support was always the best job. You were either stuck in podular direct supervision or indirect supervision, watching the inmates from the safety of the cage. Floor support was the hot spot to be! Action happened on floor support. When there was a fight or a removal? You were the cavalry.\n\nThe day progressed like any other normal day. I watched over the trustees as they cleaned the Unit, took ATW's and ROA's down to Book-in to be processed out, and sat on my ass in the control room with the other floor support Officers when there was down time. I even had time to stop by the window of that pretty Officer's pod and wave. For some reason the county forgot to block YouTube when they had updated the computer systems so we got to watch \"Billy Connolly Live in New York\" and laugh our asses off all the way till the end of shift. Unbeknownst to the supervisors of course!\nThey always say that the last little bit of shift is when God himself decides to take a SHIT on your shift. I had always braced myself for it and as the other officers were hanging up their handcuffs, putting away their gear, and turning in their radios I held on to mine for just a bit longer. Thats when i got an innocent call over the radio... \"Pod-13 has one to go to medical.\"\nI told the guys I would get it.\n\nAs soon as I saw which inmate it was i knew i was in for a ride.\n\nInmate \"Pirate\" as he was nicknamed not-so-lovingly by the other inmates, was an older man. \"Born October 9th! 1970!\" as he would often boast. Schizophrenic, huge scars all over his body, and an eyepatch to boot, it earned him that nickname quickly. He was a child in an old mans body. Broken yet happy as could be. His darker side would come out when he was depressed and though he never admitted it, he had obviously tried to kill himself multiple times before. His body was mangled. Vicious scars ran up the length of his forearms where he had opened his veins. I looked back at the officers in the control room as they laughed until they had turned red. I thought to myself, \"Of course it's Pirate...\"\n\nI looked back to Pirate and gave him a half hearted smile, \"Step this way Pirate lets get you down to medical.\" \"Oh ok!\" he replied as he showed his armband to the window. I noticed something just then as he turned away. Even though he was smiling he had a tear in his eye. \"Weird.\" I thought. But only for a brief moment. We arrived at the infirmary to one of the kinder nurses sitting down waiting for Pirate. Medical at my department were cruel and uncaring most of the time but she was different. She would always walk into my pod and smile to everyone, even the assholes. \"Have a seat Mr. Pirate.\" She said kindly. \"Do you want to tell me why you're here?\" She said with a disappointed motherly look on her face. I shifted my weight uncomfortably as I noticed something wasn't right. \"Oh I thought you called me down!\" Pirate replied. Immediately her attitude changed like a viper who'd been stepped on. Her eyes narrowed and the smile quickly faded into a sinister grimace. \n\"It's because you said you were going to kill yourself. You are down here because I got a call from your Officer saying Inmates had overheard you saying you wanted to string yourself up. Is it true or are you lying to me?\" She hissed. I had never seen this side of her so needless to say I was a tad shocked. However, being in the military and being a Detention Officer i maintained an indifferent face. Before Pirate could even answer she continued. \"I am short medical Officers, short on time and patience. Are you really wasting my fucking time by coming down here and falsely reporting that you want to kill yourself?\" Pirate, in child-like fear replied \"N-no ma'am i never said I wanted to! I'm sorr-\"\n\n\"Bullshit\" She retorted. \"Now instead of taking care of real issues I'm stuck having to do a shit load of extra paper work because of you.\nBefore he could even answer she continued. \"Dont fucking bother lets just get this suicide prevention checklist done. Question one: Do you want to hurt yourself?\"\nPirate paused and looked up to me with a look of fear and shame. \"No, not at all ma'am! Please dont send me back to seperation!\"\nThe room was getting smaller by the minute as she asked the questions. Each one with Pirate becoming more panicked.\n\n*I could tell he was lying.*\n\nI finally found my voice and stepped in, \"Pirate, bud. Answer the questions truthfully man. Were here to help you and we cant do that if you don't tell us the truth. If you really want to hurt yourself please tell us.\"\n\nHis childlike innocence poked out of his feeble frame. \"Yes sir I'm being honest! I don't want to be alone. Don't send me to separation please!\"\nMy heart sank. I knew at that moment, no matter what I said, his fear of being alone was going to force him to lie. I could do nothing but watch this pit viper tear into him.\n\n\"Have you ever tried to kill yourself before?\" She asked bluntly, more annoyed at this point than anything else.\n\n'No. I mean yes.\" Pirate replied shamefully.\nWithout even batting an eyelid at this point she replied \"When?\"\n\n\"Six months ago. It was the anniversary of my wife and daughter getting killed by a drunk driver...\"\nShe said, \"How?\" And he replied, almost excited, \"I tried to get the cops to shoot me! I pretended my cellphone was a gun and pointed it at them after they chased me!\"\n\nShe scribbled down something on her clipboard and finally looked up. \"You scored a 5 and you need an 8 to be considered suicidal. Thank you for wasting my time Mr. Pirate. Get out of here.\" I broke my stance and looked down to Pirate who was standing up. \"Lets go Mr. Pirate... I'll take you home.\" I said, quietly and kindly. I gave one disappointed look to the nurse as we left.\n\nThe walk back was near silent. I couldn't take it anymore, my head was swimming with anxiety for the old man. \"Hey Pirate, I know she was upset with you but I want you to know that we care ok? And if you really feel like you are going to hurt yourself you need to let us know. We are here to help you.\" He replied happily, \"Ok Officer Wolf I will!\"\n\nI made one last attempt before he stepped into his Pod. \"Please Pirate, don't let that rest on my conscience...\"\n\n\"Ok Officer Wolf, I won't!\" He said, reassuringly.\nI stood there watching him return to the Officers desk where the Shift Sergeant was waiting for him. Time was frozen for me. The deep night officers were passing by. \n\n\"Hey Wolf! You ok hun?\"\n\n\"Y-yeah I'm fine ma'am... Hey listen. I just watched a supposed suicidal inmate get ripped apart my medical staff who clearly didn't give a fuck. He basically lied on all the questions and she didnt even bat an eye at it... That was fucked up of her right?\" I asked, desperately looking for affirmation that my gut feeling wasn't wrong. The Officer I was talking to was an older lady, she had been a detention officer for quite some time and she was one of my favorites. Definitely the mother bear figure of deep nights. \"Wolf thats not good. You need to report that to a supervisor...\"\n\n\"Fuck. I thought out loud to her. \"The only one on shift is the Sergeant and he is the definition of a robot. He has never shown ANY empathy. Not even to Officers.\" She laughed and replied, \"Yeah he's like a robot trying to learn what its like to be human. But regardless you know thats what needs to happen.\"\n\n\"FUCK.\" I said, this time loud enough for the Officers on my shift to notice. Just then the Sergeant walked out of the Pod, visibly steaming like the robot he was. \"Hey sergeant I need to tell you something...\"\n\nI walked into his office as he slammed the door behind us. \"What is it.\" He said. \"That inmate I brought back. You know how hes schizophrenic right? Well I brought him down to medical and I watched the Medical nurse cuss him out and basically coerce him into not giving truthful answers for his suicide screening. All so she could blow off steam because she was having a bad day.\"\n\n\"Inmate Pirate?\" He replied, clearly not amused. \"I just got done cussing him out myself. Hes a fucking idiot, seriously ive seen him come in and out for years hes just a retard.\"\n\n\"A retard.\" I replied as bluntly as i could. \"Sergeant I watched him lie on a suicide screening because he was terrified of being alone and locked away in SEG.\"\n\n\"Thats his problem not ours. And medical's.\" He replied, just as bluntly.\n\nI stood there in disbelief. I couldnt believe what I was hearing. \"This guy is in charge of me? Where the fuck is his humanity? Am I fucking wrong for having a heart? WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON.\" I thought.\n\nHe clearly heard my thoughts through some telepathic robot bullshit. \"Look Officer Wolf. You're in my shoes, what do you want to do about it? SMOCK him against medical's orders? Send him to SEG?\"\n\nI retorted, \"So we just let him do it right?\" I was furious. No amount of military bearing or professional courtesy could hide that. \"He'll be fine hes right next to the Officers desk. Quit worrying its not our problem...\" He said callously.\n\nEveryone stood in the hallway chatting about the day. We were waiting on the counts to be clear by main control so we could go home for the night. This was everyone's favorite part of the night. All the stress and bullshit just melts away as we walk out the door and people seem to get two inches taller from the burden being lifted off. But not me. I stood next to that pretty Officer like I always did.\n\nBut this time I was silent.\n\nI drank a cup of water to calm my nerves. I could hear the laughter and the banter all around me but I couldn't feel any of it. I stared at the bleach white wall in front of me. I just couldn't wrap my head around how in 20 minutes my day went from great to feeling like I wanted to hide away.\n\n\"You're a fucking soldier. Chin up and move the fuck on.\" I said to myself.\n\n\"Counts are good everybody, go home.\" the sergeant said. The wave of stress lifted over my shift. All but me. I walked ahead of the pack side by side with that pretty Officer. She could tell something was up. She knew well enough not to bring it up in front of everyone.\n\nIt was still humid and hot from the day and it started to rain as I walked silently with her to my truck.\n\n\"What happened?\" She said.\n\nI relayed everything to her. Holding back tears as I went on. \"Stonefaced\" I thought to myself.\" Dont let her know you're being a bitch.\" She could see right through me though. She always could. She looked at me with soft eyes in silence, \"I'm sorry Wolf.\" She said.\n\nI wanted to tell her. I wanted to tell her so bad how sometimes I'm terrified that law enforcement isn't what Im cut out for. How it was going to keep me up tonight that I wasnt able to do enough for him. I wanted to... But I couldn't. \"Don't be a bitch Wolf. Just go home and blow off some steam.\" I thought to myself. I placed a hand on her shoulder lovingly, \"Come on I dont want you soaked listening to me prattle on. Ill be fine!\" I thinly smiled. \"Let me walk you to your car.\"\n\nWe looked at each other for what seemed like an eternity. I knew what she wanted me to say and I knew how much I wanted to say it. But I couldn't. Not yet at least. We embraced. I wanted to hold on as long as I could. I felt so much comfort in her arms, I could smell the perfume on her neck.\n\n\"Goodnight, Wolf.\" she said.\n\n\"Goodnight, pretty Officer. Thank you for listening.\" I said.\n\nThe walk back to my car was agonizing. I could feel her looking at me waiting for me to turn around. But I couldn't. Not yet at least.\nI stopped at the driver side door to my truck. The smell of cigarette smoke was intoxicating. \"No.\" I thought to myself. \"I quit and I'm not going to that for a stress reliever.\" The drive home was even worse. The only thought I could think on the way home was Pirate. I knew it was just going to get worse and worse. \"Dont take the job home with you Wolf. It will kill you.\" The words of my FTO came rushing forth. \"This job will leave you addicted to one of three things or all of them. Coffee, Cigarettes, or Alcohol.\"\n\nI pulled into a gas station to get a red bull. \"Might as well be caffeine.\" I thought to myself. I walked in to the usual 7/11 and nearly shit myself. Standing right in front of me, in line, was Inmate Roberto. This motherfucker was always fighting in jail, before he got sent off to prison, \"and hes out? ALREADY?\" My head rattled. The moment he saw me the joyous laughter I knew so well and hated so much came bellowing forth. \"OFFICER WOOOOOLF!\" he yelled, just to make sure the entire community of guys he was running with knew I was there. \"IS GOOD TO SEE YOU MAN! HOW YOU BEEN DOING?!\"\n\n\"Don't live in the same town you work in.\"\n\n**Fuck you FTO for being right.**\n\n\"Hey Roberto how are you? Its been a while. You're done with your time already?\"\n\n\"YEAH MAN I GOT DONE LAST WEEK.\"\n\nI noticed the red on his knuckles. He was freshly bleeding from them...\n\n\"Got into a fight already huh?\" I said. \"WHAT?! OH THIS?! YEAH SOME MOTHERFUCKER WAS TALKING SHIT SO I KNOCKED HIS FUCKING TEETH OUT MAN.\"\n\n\"...Good to see you haven't changed a bit man. Take care. Don't come back.\" I said automatically, since my brain had blown out the back of my skull... \"OH I WONT BRO ILL BE GOOD YOU'LL SEE.\" he bellowed.\n\n\"Oh, I'm sure I will.\" I said sarcastically smiling. I couldn't believe it. What are the chances I would run into that dude? \"Hilarious.\" I thought to myself. \"Fucking hysterical.\"\n\nI drove home, cracked open a beer and my night ended on that note. I know this line of work is for me because I do give a shit about the human condition. I know this job is for me because I wake up everyday ready to do some good. I know this job is for my because I get up everyday and go through some heart rending shit and still come out ready to go back in. I know that it is for me because I can't live or breath without the want or desire to do some good for this world. I will make the difference that the jaded staff I work with will never make. I worry about Inmate Pirate. There's no denying that. But I know that I did the best that I could for him and at the end of the day, the hammer wont fall on me if he hurts himself.\n\nThe hammer will fall on those who let the stress of the job get to them...\n\nEdit: Wow this got Gold! I want to thank all of you for your kind feedback. To give an update, Pirate is still alive. I haven't spoken to him or worked the pod he is in but I occasionally catch a glimpse of him through some of the windows. He seems to be doing well. I continue to do my best to learn and grow as an Officer and I'm grateful for the insight all of you have given me. I'm sure I'll have more stories to tell in due time! But until then, I want to thank you guys for all your encouragement! Stay safe!",

After following for a half mile the officer turned on his lights and followed the vehicle for roughly 1/4 mile before the vehicle pulled off the road. I assume we were pulling him over due to the time of night and the suspect being a possible DUI but I didn't quite have time as the suspect, a very large and intimidating guy, immediately stepped out of the vehicle with his hands half-asssedly held up halfway and walked straight back to the patrol car. \n\nThe officer very quickly got out of the car and asked the suspect what he was doing, and walked toward him and had him put his hands up on his vehicle and frisked him.\n\nI missed most of the conversation after that point but I did catch at the end, he asked for the officers name, and mentioned that he was a [high ranking political official] of [neighboring town]. Officer wished the gentleman a good night and safe travels and all and the gentleman got in his vehicle and sped away. \n\nAfterward, the officer explained to me that his dept had just signed a contract with this town to provide services and the contract hasn't yet went into effect, and he is worried that the suspect might try to convince them to back out(I guess he was acting very arrogant during the encounter.)\n\nIs this kind of politics or worry typical in smalltown policing?\n\n^(WHO THINKS ITS A GOOD IDEA TO GET OUT OF THE CAR????)\n\n",

There wasn't any shoulder, so he couldn't get out of the way. \n\nI pulled up on scene and found the van stopped on a downhill section of the freeway, just past the crest of a hill. Anyone coming over the hill was getting a last second surprise. I got out of my car to talk to the driver.\n\n\"How ya doing, sir?\"\n\n\"I've had better days.\"\n\n\"Did it break down on you?\"\n\n\"Yeah. Happened yesterday, too.

I talked to the driver again.\n\n\"Why didn't you just do that before I got here?\"\n\n\"Well with the hill, I didn't want people to come over the hill and see my van right there and have me get hit.

        "text": "This happened two days ago actually.\n\nI work at an airport, so naturally I have very odd start/finish times. This particular day I had a 0430 start, and as the staff car park is serviced by a shuttle bus that comes every 15 minutes - I always plan on getting to the car park for around half an hour before my shift. I live around half an hours drive away from the airport, so 0300 alarm followed by a 0330 departure from my house is routine.\n\nDriving in the very early hours on a Sunday is always the quietest time of the week by far. I sometimes don't encounter a single car on my journey in until I meet other staff/passengers around the airport perimeter. Because of this, I obviously can drive a little bit faster through the usually busy roads. This occasion was no different - I don't drive at crazy speeds, 90mph is viewed as slightly fast but not out of the ordinary in the UK on the motorway.\n\nWhilst going over a major junction (where one London bound motorway reaches a west-east motorway) there is a small dual carriageway section with various lanes feeding in. Doing 90mph on the indside lane, a dark coloured Skoda estate merges in behind me and is glued to my tail. I speed up a little bit as it's annoying me, eventually reaching around 100mph. The car behind remains glued to me.\n\nI continue this for about a mile before I slow down for my exit, as I indicate to come off, the car behind does. I come to a stop at a roundabout with traffic lights on (briefly considering going through the red light, but I never get beyond the 'maybe I'll go through it this time' stage). I check my rear view mirror and I notice a glint in the reflection of the stab proof vest the police officer is wearing behind me from the street light. Oh shit. Looking closer, I can see a small bar of lights mounted on the inside of the windscreen, and a couple of lights on each side mirror. Double Shit.\n\nThe car pulls along side, rolls down his window and the figure inside motions me to put mine down - I comply.\n\nInside is a fully uniformed Police Officer, he glares at me for a second, letting every bad thought sink in. Over 100mph in the UK is an instant court case, and he chased pretty much chased me down the motorway.\n\nAfter an eternity he finally shouts across;\n\n\"Do you have any idea how fast you were going there mate?\"\n\nI stammered out some mish-mash of words.\n\n\"If I ever see you doing that again - you're coming in, you understand?\"\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"Have a safe rest of your drive, and watch your speed.\"\n\nAnd with that, he drove off through the now green lights, went round the roundabout and back on the motorway heading in the opposite direction.\n\nI creeped the remainder of the journey to work, wondering why he let me off for such a blatant rule break, but also relieved that I happened to come across such a nice police officer.\n\n0600 start tomorrow morning - I wonder if I'll come across him again.",

        "text": "Not the greatest story teller, might be a bit poorly written.\n\nI will admit, right from the beginning, that I deserved this ticket. I was speeding, there's no denying it. It's just the circumstances that make it all a bit annoying to me. I dutifully paid my ticket and continued driving the same way I always have.\n\nI was on my way to school one bright sunny morning. Took a left turn onto this four-lane bridge(two lanes in each direction), right behind 2 cars, the front one being a lawn maintenance truck. This truck did not look well cared for, rusty and pretty badly beaten up. Maintenance appliances were hanging off at all angles, poorly secured with frayed rope. This being a massive and old truck, it was going quite slowly and the car in front of me had no apparent intentions of overtaking it. So that's what I did. I sped up a bit, the limit on the bridge was 50mph, I was now doing roughly 45mph as I had just pulled out from behind the lumbering truck. \n\nJust as I was basically right next to the truck, a car quite close behind me(as I was still doing below the limit) this lawn-trimmer loosens one of it's bindings and starts falling towards my car. Now I loved that car, and I'll be damned if I let some lawn maintenance appliance knock a nice dent in it. Due to the tailgaiting car behind me braking was not an option. So I hit the gas.\n\nA decent car will make a small jump when the gas pedal is pressed, this beast had a somewhat sexy 4.8L V8 engine outputting 360 hp and basically bounded away from this truck. Sadly, for me, all of this happened right before the top of the bridge. As I shot over the top of the bridge, having not even had a chance to brake once I got a few meters ahead of that Mad Max style lawn maintenance truck, I see the officer parked on the right side of the bridge. I knew immediately that he had gotten me with his rear radar. While that thought process was going through my head, I was braking and had slowed down to the limit again. It was too late.\n\nAs I cruised past him, he lit up and followed me. I pulled into a near parking lot and talked to him. I politely described what had happened and why I had sped up. I ended up getting a ticket for doing 65mph in a 50mph zone. However, he was a nice officer, he listened to what I had to say, we had a nice chat, and he said he'd keep an eye out for that truck. All in all an expensive but good experience. \n\nTL;DR : Mad Max style maintenance truck launches lawn trimmer towards me, got a ticket in the process of avoiding it.\n\nEdit: Lane number clarification",

        "text": "This happened a few weeks ago; My regular bar is a community dive, its clean, friendly, and best of all cheap. The last part can kinda bring out the crazies from time to time.\n\nI was taking a friend out for his 21st birthday. He was meeting all the regulars and my friends when I see a fight break out between two people, orange sweatshirt and black shirt. They are both much smaller than me (i'm 6'2 220, they were both MAYBE 5'8) so I pull them apart, and tell them to walk in the opposite directions (sometimes cooler heads prevail after too much liquor). Orange Sweatshirt walks into the bathroom, and Black Shirt walks around the large sitting area, not noticing I've got my eye on him the whole time. Black Shirt decides that the fight isn't over and makes a walking beeline for the bathroom. I get in his way and tell him that he can't go in there while Orange Sweatshirt is in there (you can't fight in the bar, go in the alley, I don't give a shit). I'm blocking the door and a buddy of mine comes over to block with me. Black Shirt gets the idea and walks out to the patio, I think he's got the idea.\n\nOrange Sweatshirt is apologetic and super compliant, leaves them a very good tip as an apology and leaves. Bartender was going to let it go until she saw Black Shirt try to come back to the bathroom, she's decided that his night is over and tells him to leave. He refuses; she calls the cops. Officer has a maybe 2 minute response time, as in, bartender is still on the phone with the dispatch as cruiser pulls up. Black shirt tries walking away, knowing he's been beaten. Officer tells him to stop and sit on the curb.\n\nAt this point, its probably going to end in a check for warrants and a stern lecture about assault and trespassing; Black shirt doesn't get that, he gets belligerent and decides that he wants to stand up. Officer tells him to sit down, but Black Shirt won't comply. Officer starts trying to wrestle him to the ground. They were about the same size and it looks like Black Shirt might win. Back-up is probably on the way, but I call out if the officer wanted assistance, he responds that he needs it. Four of us upturn this guy and put him on his face. Once Black Shirt was subdued, Officer calls for more backup. Officers showed up from all directions and replaced us one by one. By the time I got replaced there were 9 squad cars and at least 15 officers. Black Shirt starts spouting off about how the officers are murderers and how he will kill them all.\n\nWe learned after the incident that the initial Orangesweatshirt v. Black Shirt started because Black shirt grabbed his own girlfriend by the throat in the bar. If I had known that, I might have dragged his face across the pavement.\n\nMoral of the story? In a small but affluent town; the people generally like the cops, and the cops are well funded.\n",

        "text": "“You sure it’s no problem?” \n\n“Really, it’s not. All my cases are BS right now anyway. A murder trumps all of them.” Brian seemed to think I’d be giving him more of a fight in his time of need. \n\n“Any other day I would be there in a heartbeat, I swear.”\n\n“Dude, chill. We all have obligations. I’ll handle this and keep you updated.”\n\n“You’re the man. I’ll text you the latest intel from the informant. Thanks a ton.” Brian hung up and I continued on to the spot the informant had provided as the last place he saw our suspect. The case was fairly typical of the murders we were assigned: drug robbery gone bad ending with one dirt bag shooting another - and now it was on us to track down the suspect to re-introduce him to the criminal justice system before he was sucked into the street justice machine. \n\nMy next line of business was to rally some troops to help me out. None of my squad mates were available so I’d be relying mostly on patrol. Luckily, both the murder and the location the bad guy was last seen were in the same patrol area. The commander of the station there was a hard charger and I knew any request I made would be granted. In no time, I was briefing the staff members the station could spare. The group was made up of a few fresh-from-the-academy street cops, two K9 officers, a couple bike team guys, and three plain clothes detectives. \n\n“Here’s the freshest info: a CI hit us up this morning and said our bandit is staying at a town home right next to the playground. He said he saw him walking back from McDonald’s this morning around ten AM but isn’t sure exactly which house it was he entered. Brian and I have been researching the block and have cleared all but two of the houses closest to the playground – 237 and 244 Oak. We’ll concentrate on those but be cautious of the others too – he might have more than one friend in this dump.” \n\n“Here’s what we’ll do: plain clothes guys – you’ve got the interior perimeter. Try to take something other than your Impalas and Crown Vics into the neighborhood and park… inconspicuously.”  The trio walked off to grab some undercover cars. \n\n“Bike guys, K9 – I’d like you all to be just outside the inner perimeter on foot. Hopefully we’ll have some support from the helicopter but just in case, you’ll all make up the reaction team. If the inner perimeter guys see anything, they’ll direct you all where to shuffle to be the most good. This guy’s a murderer, he could use a bite or four.” I aimed the last bit at the dog handlers and they nodded in approval. \n\n“Patrol dudes – sorry but you’re gonna be in your marked cars on the outer perimeter. I’d like you to prevent anyone coming in to the row of townhomes while we’re in there. This neighborhood is ours today, at least until we get our guy. If he takes off running, we’ll get his direction of travel out ASAP and you’ll be our back up plan.”\n\nIn moments we were heading to the scene in a motley convoy. Once the plain clothes guys were in place, I had my reaction team form two posts at the only two foot paths leading out of the area. The K9 teams joined up on one side, bike team folks on the other. I stayed far enough back to be able to flit back and forth between the two groups without being seen by anyone in the houses we were targeting, all the while maintaining radio contact with the guys on the inner perimeter and fielding questions from the patrol guys and in-coming extras who were glomming on to the party late. \n\nAn hour passed slowly with little action on the front lines. I spent the time fielding calls from commanders of three different entities, running computer checks on my various devices, and attempting to swap out personnel for breaks. It’s a tedious process and you can’t let yourself drop out of high alert less some minor emergency ruin the whole plan. \n\nI was on my way to the bike team group when I was intercepted by a street supervisor sent to take over the operation. Usually, when the investigations section is working a case (as was going on in this scenario) they’re provided all the authority of a supervisor. It’s a show of faith that someone who specializes in a specific investigation is usually the best person to call the shots during said investigation. I guess they had wanted faster results somewhere above my pay grade and sent a lieutenant to get results. That was the bad news. The good news was the guy sent to replace my authority was a former boss of mine. \n\n“EMR.” He greeted me dryly and glanced around to make sure no one was close enough to hear. “What the hell are we doing?” The words escaped his mouth as though he had his hand in a ventriloquist dummy. \n\n“Hey hey! Lt! Fancy seeing you at this mess!” I gave him the rundown of my plan and fielded several questions he knew would be asked of him but also that I had realized would be asked of me. I come prepared. \n\n“Well… I guess… I’ll be over here then.” He ambled over to his new Impala, a perk of rank. “Before you do anything too stupid, give me a call and I’ll be the one to voice it on the radio, cool? Take the heat off of us both?” \n\nI clicked my heels together and gave a sharp but sarcastic salute. “Ja wohl!” He shook his head in disgust. We all knew it was a BS game we were playing part in – pretending rank outclassed skillset - but the bigger job at hand was to get our guy. I was happy to play along as long as I knew my ‘superior’ had my back. \n\nWhen I finally arrived at the bike team post, the radio crackled to life. It was the voice of one of our majors – higher on the food chain than the station commander and putting his nose into this operation when he was better suited behind a desk somewhere. \n\n“Unit 3. I don’t know why the road leading in to the scene is closed but at this time have all patrol assets move to a location where they aren’t blocking vehicular traffic.” His voice was nasally and annoyed. \n\nLt fired back before I had time to (stupidly) react. “Car 12: the roads are blocked off to prevent too much traffic in case of gunfire from the suspect. We still have the murder weapon outstanding. We’re still permitting foot traffic entrance to the community.” Our operation was really only having an impact on a couple dozen homes in the middle of a Wednesday. Most residents were at work anyway and the ones who weren’t probably knew a lot more information to aid in our investigation but weren’t being very cooperative. If they had to walk an extra block to get to their house versus drive into a potential crossfire, I figured they deserved the exercise. \n\n“Unit 3: I’m aware of that threat but we got a call to the chief’s office and citizens are demanding access. All patrol assets are to allow vehicular traffic. The chief has installed me as primary unit in charge.”\n\nThe bike guys and I all exchanged sighs and eye rolls. A few seconds later a car pulled up to a parking space nearby. A hefty gentleman exited and spat in our direction. “I don’t care if y’all muthafuckas in here arrestin’ Bin Louding. I’ma call the chief and shut y’all down!” We were far enough away for the cordial greeting to not be observed by the target’s residence, but not so far that a confrontation on the sidewalk would have gone unnoticed. We gave some silent and sarcastic thumbs up in return instead, and went back to surveillance. \n\nPeriodically throughout the day the helicopter had been overhead – not unusual for that neighborhood anyway – and had just cleared again as I left the bike team post to go back to my K9 handlers. \n\n“Inner perimeter to all units. Just had a red vehicle pull in to the row of our target. Parking in front of 237 now.” I hustled to my car to receive the fresh info on the car and run it immediately. “Tag is going to be 35HC67. Driver is still in the vehicle.”\n\nI ran the tag and got a return indicating it was registered to a company, AA-Stellar, LLC. “Returns to a company.” I informed the radio. “I’m going to keep digging on it.”\n\nA quick google search of AA-Stellar showed it to be an independent contractor specializing in cable and satellite TV installations. Not your usual job for the friend of a murderous drug dealer, but not out of the realm either. \n\n“Driver’s exiting… he’s in a red polo shirt.” The inner perimeter updated. \n\n“The company it’s registered to does cable and satellite installations. Maybe it’s just a service call? Keep an eye on the windows.”\n\n“10-4. Subject is approaching the door to 237… knocking now.”\n\nThere was some tense silence while I awaited an update. \n\n“No answer at the door. Driver is using his cell phone now. Walking back to his car.”\n\nCrap, I thought. That would’ve been too easy to have our guy answer the door. I exited my vehicle and started my way to the K9 crew again. A few steps away from my door, I saw them approaching me.\n\n“I was coming to see you all. Who relieved you?” I asked. \n\n“Unit 3. He said he wanted us to go back in service.” One of them shrugged. \n\n“So there’s no one out there at your surveillance post?”\n\n“Nope!” The other replied over his shoulder as he was being dragged away by his dog. “We’ve learned not to question the big brass!”\n\nI sighed and weighed my options. I didn’t want to rock the boat too bad for Lt’s sake, but this ship was taking on water and I was still in charge, at least in spirit. I decided I’d man the post alone until I could figure out another option and started off again. \n\nI came to the post a minute later – a privacy fence behind an end unit that was across a sidewalk and grassy area and indexed back off the target house, number 237. I had a good view of the back door and windows and to the right of the break of houses was the parking lot where my plain clothes guys were stationed. Beyond that was the other side of the street with more town homes, another break in the rows, and the bike team post. \n\n“Driver’s still on the phone but he’s exiting the car again.” The inner perimeter told us all. \n\nI heard the door slam from my spot but couldn’t see him. \n\n“He’s walking… away from the front door, going to the side of the house.” The man in the red polo came into my view. He was cradling a clipboard and talking loudly on his cell phone.\n\n“I’m telling you, no one’s answering.” He said, annoyed. “Ok, ok. I’ll go try.” He then hung up and continued walking while muttering to himself. \n\n“Inner perimeter. We’ve lost visual. Anyone have the eye?” \n\n“I’ve got it.” I whispered into my mic. “He’s rounded the back of the house.” The man was scanning the roof and electric box, then tried pushing open the rear gate of the privacy fence. “He’s made it into the backyard.”\n\nThere was radio silence but I could hear the glass slider being pounded on. Another pause came before he again exited the yard and pulled his phone out with a sigh. \n\n“FRONT DOOR! WE’VE GOT A RUNNER!” The radio exploded. \n\nMy first instinct was to bolt in their direction but I paused and looked to see what the inner perimeter was doing. None of them were getting out of their cars like I had expected. “GET YOUR DOGS UP HERE! HE’S RUNNING THROUGH THE PARKING LOT!”\n\nIf I had been a handler, my spot would’ve been perfect for a release. The suspect was sprinting away from the house, his long dread locks flopping with each step. He was oblivious to my presence. Unfortunately, I had no dog. I began sprinting too. \n\n“He’s passing the break, heading east on Oak! Outer perimeter, be ready!” I yelled into my shoulder as I bolted past the confused inner perimeter detectives. The suspect turned in front of the houses across the street instead of making the cut as I had hoped. He would’ve fell right into the arms of the bike team but instead skirted the inner perimeter cars in the parking lot. I tried my best to keep up.\n\n“Black male, jeans, blue t-shirt, long dreads…” I huffed into the radio.\n\n“Where is he?!?” The bike team asked.\n\n“Still heading east. Shift toward the road!” Had Unit 3 not moved my guy stopping cars from entering the parking lot, he’d have been in another perfect position. The suspect exited his row of town homes and glanced back over his shoulder. I’m not sure he was more surprised the cops were chasing him or that I was the only one. Either way, he rounded to the left then doubled back behind the row of houses he had just run in front of. \n\nI slowed, taking quick breaths and trying to stabilize myself while I took the next part with care. I mic’d up with my left hand while drawing my gun with my right and training it on the corner. “He doubled back behind the houses. Bikes, he might be heading your way.”\n\nI slowly pied off the corner, worried about an ambush. It seemed to take an eternity but I didn’t want to risk being the second body on the bad guy’s kill list. Then: nothing. The yard of the last home couldn’t have been more barren. It provided him no cover so he must have kept going. \n\n“I’ve lost visual. Get the helo back here ASAP and where are my K9’s??” I yelled into the mic, not caring who thought they were in charge at that moment. \n\n“K9’s en-route. Give us a landmark.”\n\n“End unit at Oak and third. I’m standing by where I last saw him.” I was still trying to catch my breath. \n\nSirens filled the air as units scrambled to get close enough to be of assistance. I knew we had a decent perimeter before but it sounded as though our personnel had doubled again since my planning stage. \n\n“Bikes will be slow searching. ETA on Helo?” \n\n“Helo is refueling. ETA 10 minutes.” The dispatcher advised. I cursed my rotten luck aloud. I had to stay where I was for K9 and my own good. One on one is not the preferable way to go into a potential gun fight. \n\nI could see down the row of town homes all the way to the break where the bike guys should have been but they were nowhere to be found. I found out later they had gone another row deep through the break. The confused glances of some of the inner perimeter guys met my scanning eyes as they bobbed and peeked around the corner of the house at the end of my row. Another row of town homes backed up to the area, forming a grassy alleyway of sorts. Several of the yards had privacy fences, but even more did not. The landscaping was a hodgepodge of overgrown shrubbery, perfect for hiding behind. And I hadn’t even considered the possibility of him kicking in a door and breaking through our perimeter via burglary. “Keep it tight. He could be bedded down or could have entered another home.” I hypothesized over the air.\n\nK9 finally arrived and I spelled out the end of my pursuit with the target. They split up and took a side each of the alley, slowly searching with their dogs on extended leads. I split the middle, gun still drawn but staying back from the two teams. \n\n“Got movement at the backyard of the end unit, Elm and Third!” Someone called out. I tried to visualize the area in my head. Elm was the street on the other side of us, the ones whose backyards we were checking to our right. 458 would have put it on the other side of the street from us though. “SUBJECT’S RUNNING!” The same voice yelled over the radio again. “We’re too far away to catch up. Heading west behind Elm!” \n\nThe sirens started again and I saw the plain clothes guys sprint through the break up ahead of us. Instead of joining them, I doubled back the way I had come, skirting up the east side of the road and turning left towards Elm, east of where the subject was last seen. I met up with a couple uniforms – the ones who had last seen the target - toting their long guns. I motioned one to stay on the front side of Elm while the other follow me behind the row. Once there, I saw we had both sides covered and we began slow searching the yards towards each other. My patrol partner and I had knocked out two yards, the plain clothes guys and bike team had leapfrogged their way through about five when a sudden sound caused us all to pause. Somewhere in the three or so yards between us, something had struck the metal grate of an air conditioning unit. Lt had made it up to me and the patrol guy by that point, panting a bit but happy to be in the action. \n\n“He’s in one of these three.” I rasped quietly to him. “Nice and slow.” I began indexing back from the next fence, rolling my shoulders to be a lower profile target while training my gun on the slowly opening area. No points of cover were there, he had to be in the next two. \n\n“HANDS HANDS, SHOW ME YOUR FUCKING HANDS!!!” Yelling erupted from the yard two doors down. It was one of the bike guys. “IF YOU DON’T COMPLY YOU WILL BE SHOT!”\n\nMy trio hustled over to assist the other group. We slowly moved in on the target. His arms were peeking out from underneath a pink plastic kiddie pool. They were empty and trembling. \n\n“Where the hell is K9?!?” One of the detectives asked. \n\n“Dunno but let’s do this.” I replied, my sights aligned in the approximate area I though a torso would be. “Slowly, stand up and keep your hands away from your body!” I ordered.\n\n The target complied, glancing nervously at all the guns trained on him. \n\n“Now, duck out from under that pool.” It had hung up on his head like some ridiculous Indian headdress. He shrugged it off. \n\n“Turn around away from me and start taking steps backwards towards my voice!” I ordered again. \n\nThe suspect complied once more. I could hear the panting of a K9 to my right. \n\n“Keep coming, keep coming…” I nodded to two of the bike guys who had holstered up and drawn cuffs. The swept in and quickly secured him. \n\nI finally exhaled. \n\nWe found the gun in a bush where the target had doubled back on me – it had jammed a round attempting to be fed from the magazine and was bricked. Lucky for me. \n\nLt was grateful for the help, telling me he was sure the commander would be as well. Unit 3 was having a powwow with various other shades of brass, ignoring me as I passed him to get loaded up in my car. \n\n“EMR, want to talk to the cable guy?” One of the inner perimeter guys asked over the radio.\n\nI did and walked to meet the ashen faced instigator. I shook his hand. “Thanks for flushing our murderer.”\n\n“I aint sign up for this shit.” He muttered with a laugh. “I thought I was about to get taken down SWAT style. Jesus.”\n\n“I’m just glad he didn’t blow you away through the door.” \n\n“Yeah? You think??” He asked me wide eyed. “Guess I won’t be getting an HBO up-sale outa this place…”\n",

        "text": "This all transpired in the last half hour.\n\nI'm sitting at my local bar, having a drink and waiting for bar trivia to start, and feel the need to step outside to pollute my lungs.  What should I see but a man and a woman looking for something in the bar parking lot.  Initially I ignore it, but pretty quickly red flags start rising as I hear what the man is saying to the woman.  \"You're worthless, I don't know why I'm with you, you can't do anything right, you make my life impossible, you're a piece of shit,\" etc etc etc.  Clear signs of an abusive relationship.\n\nObviously, I start taking more interest in the situation.  The woman is small, heavily bundled up, and smiling very weakly at all these grave insults, obviously trying to placate the man.  He, on the other hand, is a very large party of one.  I'm a big guy at 6'2\" and 230, but this guy has at least 2 inches and 40 pounds on me.  He notices me, scowls heavily, stops talking, and walks around the corner lighting his own cigarette.\n\nI approach the woman, who looks both frantic and resigned. I ask if I can help, and she says she dropped a ring and is looking for it.  I give her my flashlight, because it's already dark and a TK-15 will light up a lot.  I then step back and let her search, meanwhile memorizing her description. \n\nThe man then returns, and while he looks like he wants to say something to me, the open bar door behind me means witnesses.  So he remains silent for a while, before telling the woman it's time to go.  She hands me back my flashlight, thanking me profusely, and they walk away.\n\nThey cross the street, and that's when I see him hit her.  Just once, but once is 20 times too many.  I dig out my phone, and call 911 to report a DV in progress.  I stay outside, because this bar is less than half a mile from the county sheriff substation, so response times are often very short. \n\nThe couple disappear off into the darkness in the direction of the local school.  Just a few seconds later, up pulls the white-and-green of our county sheriff.  And another right behind him.  As the first deputy is getting out of his car, two more pull up.  Then a fifth.  *And a sixth.*  The fifth one obviously has a ride along with them, as the passenger gets out in civilian dress with the big \"O\" name tag of an observer.\n\nI talk with the first deputy, a senior sergeant I've met a couple times.  I relay the story to him along with descriptions and a general heading of the couple.  Meanwhile I now have a small crowd of deputies around me, listening in.  The sergeant hits his radio and starts relaying info, as yet *THREE MORE* units drive up, pause, and then turn in different directions, going off after these people.\n\nSome of the deputies then get back in their cars, one set obviously being a rookie/FTO.  Soon it's just me, the sergeant, and the deputy with the ride along.  When who should come up out of the darkness of a back yard but the very couple I called in.  I point them out and everyone moves to intercept.  I wisely stay next to the bar, and light another cigarette, because this is going to be interesting to watch.\n\nThey make contact.  Conversation is made.  IDs are handed over.  The subjects are separated and interviewed as the other units start arriving.  By now we have a total of eight cars and 11 deputies on scene.  Two cars have their lights on, so the whole place is lit by street lights and flickering red/blues.\n\nOh, oh dear.  One deputy is next to me when I hear the radio come back with info on the male.  Warrants.  Several of them, all felonies for assault and DV.  Total fucking scumbag.\n\nHe was arrested.  Gave a half-hearted attempt at resisting, but quickly realized how badly he was outnumbered and gave up.  Made a few very nasty statements at the woman before being shoved in the back of a Charger.\n\nAnother car pulls up, unmarked, occupant dressed in business casual but sporting no badge. My guess is social services or something like that, because she made a bee-line for the woman and began talking very earnestly to her, where she soon broke down in tears.  Eventually they both get in the unmarked and drive away, about the same time most of the other units take their own leave.\n\nI'm just left with the sergeant, and the deputy with the ride along.  The sergeant thanks me for being attentive, and I thank him for his overwhelming response.  I also ask the ride along if he's having a good time, to which he responds it's his first time riding and this is really exciting.  They then finally leave, and I go back into the bar for another drink and the satisfaction that I just helped someone out.\n\nTL;DR - Don't be a dick at my regular bar, I *will* get you arrested for that.  Plus, CCSO doesn't fuck around with DV.",

        "text": "Grand Theft Auto\n\nDramatis Personae\n***\nPolice Officer 1................................................Anthony Mackie\n\nPolice Officer 2................................................Chris Evans\n\nMe....................................................................John Cho\n\nIt was a dark and stormy night. \n\nOkay, I lied, it was a bright and sunny afternoon. I was on my way home from a morning at the gun range. I was wearing an old leather jacket, beat up jeans and my Bates enforcers that have seen better days. The zipper on those boots were repaired 4 times, and I think this was the end. I was cruising up the highway at a leisurely 65mph, with the cruise control on. I think my only crime at the moment was listening to AC/DC at less than max volume. Aptly, Highway to Hell was playing, and lo and behold my day was about to go straight there.\n\nThe lights came on behind me. Must not have noticed, focused on the road in front of me as I was. With the music that low, I heard the wail as the sirens behind me went on, and I looked in the rearview to see the angry looking Dodge Charger Pursuit living up to it's name. The officer in the vehicle did not look any happier. I was already in the process of pulling over when his voice came over the loudspeaker. Confirmed my suspicions too; he was DEFINTIELY angry.\n\n“DRIVER, PULL YOUR VEHICLE OVER”\n\nSeeing as I was already complying, I hit the hazards, and parked as far away from the highway as possible, putting my right side tires in the grass. I started going for my license before I thought better of it. Thankfully my rear glass was tinted so the officer missed me moving. In my rearview, I caught sight of him drawing his gun, and I went white. What was going on here?!\n\nHe barked his orders, telling me to shut the car down, show both hands, then use my right hand to get out. I had my hands up, and was told to walk backwards towards him. People were staring as they blew past. I of course complied with every order. Next thing I knew, I had handcuffs on.\n\n&gt;Me: “What did I do? What's with the handcuf-”\n\n&gt;Officer 1: “Shut up. You are under arrest on suspicion of Grand Theft Auto.”\n\nHe read me my rights, and sat me down in the squad car. I managed to get a few words out.\n\n&gt;Me: “Wait, what? This is my car! I have the registration and everything!”\n\nHe turned and glared at me.\n\n&gt;Me: “Seriously, it's in the glove box! I was just coming back from a day at the shooting range!”\n\nWrong thing to say I guess. He came back, then shut the door, as he got on the radio. I sat for perhaps ten minutes, until the other car pulled up. Officer 2 spoke briefly with Officer 1. I had no idea what they were saying, but considering they kept gesturing to my car and the trunk in particular.\n\n&gt;Officer 2: “So you said this is your car. We need your ID and see if it matches the registration we found.”\n\n&gt;Me: “Back pocket, can I get it or do you have to?”\n\nHe retrieved my wallet and read the ID, finding that the car was indeed mine. I was immediately let out of the car, then the cuffs. I rubbed my wrists.\n\n&gt;Me: Can I ask what the hell this was all about?\n\nOfficer 2 hesitated, then nodded.\n\n&gt;Officer 2: “We got a call from a woman who was almost hysterical. Said someone stole her car at gunpoint. Blue Mustang, same tag number, fit the exact description of your car. But apparently she was lying. You said you were shooting this morning?”\n\n&gt;Me: “Yes sir, rifle and shotgun.”\n\n&gt;Officer 1(Now visibly relaxed and no longer staring daggers at me): “Sorry about all this. One last thing, do you mind if we inspect your firearms to confirm they are legal?”\n\nRelieved that I wasn't going to jail for driving my own car I agreed. They told me to stay near their car, and they pulled my guns out. A quick glance, and they put them back in the case. They handed me the keys back to my car and let me leave, shaken. As I was walking back to my car to continue my journey home, Officer 2 waved me over.\n\n&gt;Officer 2: “For what it's worth sir, your AR-15 is awesome. Have a good day, and clean that when you get home.”\n\nI did just that.",

        "text": "This happened back when I was 14. Probably one of the scariest things I've ever experienced and has shaped the way I see police officers and law enforcement for the rest of my life.\n\nIn mid summer of 2008 my brother and I loved to get together and go on long winding walks through the big fields our city's electric company used for their power lines. Ever since I had moved from a nasty lower income neighborhood to these suburbs those fields had been a beautiful space of clean, green grass and magical pockets of woods. A safe-haven of sorts for adventurous types like my brother and I who's heads were filled up with all sorts of grand notions that could only be played out in the woods with some sticks skipping rocks.\n\nOne day, however our walk took us farther than usual. We passed through an area that didn't have fresh soft bermuda grass or creeks. This place was an arid waste of hilly dry dirt and abandoned toys. It was here I found my scepter for the evening's adventure. A rusty old piece of a bike that was buried end-up in the clay. Once we had reached a certain point we realized how long it would take us to get home and decided to return. However, once we'd reached sight of the road we noticed a stranger approaching from a parked red SUV. My brother suddenly went quiet. I wasn't sure why but noticed that we were about to walk into a rusty line of barbed wire that was so low to the ground you almost couldn't see it past the patchy grass. Being blusterous and hammy I took my bike-piece and pushed the wire down to help my brother pass over it without hurting himself. We waved to the approaching stranger, a man in his mid 30s, in a rough tank top and jeans. My brother was still dead silent. The exchange went just like this.\n\nMe: Howdy! Beautiful day isn't it? (My accent is the result of a mix of Kentucky and Oklahoma heritage.)\nBrother: Hey there, sir.\nMan: Hey. What're you boys doin' out here?\nMe: Just out for a walk. Enjoying this beautiful day.\nMan: Are you fucking stupid or something?\n\nThis was where it all went downhill. I was already unsure of who this man was or what he wanted, but that statement led to a huge meltdown of rage. He insulted us, threatened us, asked us how we would like it if he came in our houses, stole our things and trashed our backyards.) Obviously, he hadn't mentioned it was his property yet, and when he did we apologized, said we saw no signs and offered to leave. He refused to let us leave. I dropped my scepter early on, not wanting to seem threatening. In retrospect I should have known something was fishy with how he was acting. Especially when he began to shout \"DO YOU WANT TO FUCKING GO WITH ME!? DO YOU WANNA WHOOP MY ASS!?\" Which is when he raised his arms and my brother saw the pistol on his hip.\nI hadn't, and if I had then I wouldn't have tried to act tough. I replied that I would and then he pounced saying \n\"I am the MOTHER FUCKING POH-LEECE!\"\nI didn't believe him, and still didn't see his gun. He produced no badge. No I.D. No nothing except more threats and swears and insults to which I refused to respond physically. Eventually I'd had enough, told my brother we were leaving and reached down to pick up my pipe. That's when I found myself in a full nelson with this man screaming spit and sweat into my ear about how I thought I could do whatever I wanted...because I was white.\nHe smashed me into his van and held me there in that nelson for a half an hour while we supposedly waited on the police (which he called) to arrive. A marine saw the scene from his car, pulled over and convinced the man to let me sit on the curb while we waited. He was the only one to ask our ages. My brother, 17. Me 14.\nWhen the officers arrived they separated us. We both told the truth. He apparently wove a wild tale of us assailing him with racial slurs, brandishing pipes at him and mocking his badge. I felt so powerless. So angry and stupid to have let this happen. He wanted us charged with trespassing, assault of an officer and resisting arrest. Thanks to a few good family friends we got hooked up with an excellent lawyer who tore his evidence for all those things to shreds and we never went to court. I filed with internal affairs who knew the officer by name before I reported it to them. I never knew what happened to him, but have felt angry and ashamed and guilty ever since. Cops make me jumpy now. Even though I drive like a grandma and am a bit of a nice-guy square with a tough-guy complex. I can't trust badges anymore. I barely trust the law. Just wanted to weigh in with other officers on this. What do you think about the knee-high wire fence?\n",

        "text": "Back in the 90s, when I was about six or seven, my father decided to get into some fairly complex hobbies, humidor building and cigar collecting, square foot gardening and near-commercial scale Swordtail fish breeding. This meant three banquet tables set up with grow lights, woodworking tools, repurposed boxes and 'nice' scrapwood, activated charcoal, stain, and varnish, as well as three ninety gallon aquarium tanks set up in the garage, along with a hodgepodge of tubing, heaters, aquarium bubblers, a brine shrimp hatchery (to feed the Swords) and timers. Now, apparently this played merry hell with the electricity bill, and got us dinged as suspicious by the cops. (To be fair, there was an actual meth den/brothel being run out of a house a few doors down, so it was reasonable.)\n\nI, being a reasonably perceptive child, noticed that suddenly there were QUITE a few cop cars continually roaming our street, and that they would look at our house in particular as they drove by. My father, in his innocent obliviousness, would wave to them as he mowed the lawn or had a beer and cigar on the porch. They'd scowl and drive off, he'd shrug. \n\nOf course, the day came when a cop happened to drive past while the garage door was up. Dad was changing the oil on his ancient Nissan pickup, and I was ~~helping~~ bothering him with all the enthusiasm a kid could muster. Poor officer must have given himself absolute whiplash, he stomped the brakes so hard. \n\nHe parked, then sauntered up to us, looking somehow both entirely ominous and full of glee. \"Sir, may I speak to you a moment?\" \n\nDad scooted out from under the car, greasy and bearded like an Italian Grizzly Adams. \"Sure! What's up?\" Glasses askew, grinning like he always does, ready to make friends with the proverbial pole cat. \n\n\"Sir may I look in your garage?\" Cop hitched up his belt, eyeing me with a frown. I was too busy collecting snails to care much, but I remember the SOLID smack of disapproval his eyes had. Dang. \n\nDad was thrilled! Perhaps he'd found a gardening and cigar buddy, or better yet, an aquarium and cigar buddy. \"Sure!\" again. He practically dragged the poor guy in by the arm. \"I took apart this old silverware box, it's solid mahogany and I'm fitting it out to hold cigars, it's almost done I'm just waiting for my moisture meter to arrive, and I'm starting a ton of bell peppers, and then I've got these great tomatoes, I saved seeds from one at the store because my wife shops at Gelson's and they charge A DOLLAR FIFTY for each tomato, can you believe it, and here's the string beans, I think I planted too many if you want them, and this is the brine shrimp hatchery, see, they go in this two liter bottle and you bubble air in and the eggs float and hatch, then they go in here to feed the Red Velvet swordtails, this is the brood tank, and here are the males and females separated out, do you want a couple? I've got some ziplock bags here if you have an aquarium at home and-\" he chattered on, completely unaware that the poor officer was intent on a drug bust, and was now entirely overwhelmed with a fourpack of tomato seedlings in each hand and a clearly deranged man offering to give him more live fish than he had ever seen in his life. \n\nBy now I was in the garage too, and contributing my own helpful comments. \"Dad has a huge garden, and he lets me help, except I pulled out all the carrots too early and he said pick the bell peppers when they're the size of my fist, so I did, but he meant his fist, so now we have to plant more! Mom says not to smoke in the house because it smells but Dad does anyways in the study that used to be my room! Do you like fish? These ones don't lay eggs, they have live babies like people do! I have my own aquarium, but I only have a goldfishy named Flounder like in The Little Mermaid! She sings like this! AaaaAaaaaAaaah AaaaAAAAaaaah!\" \n\nHe made a run for it. Dad followed, a sixpack of greenbean seedlings in either hand, and a couple cigars too.  I swear he even managed to tuck a cigar into the poor guy's front pocket. Somehow, the seedlings made it into the back of the squad car without incident, my beloved Dad even doing the double pat of the car roof as he shut the door and waved goodbye to the poor cop, who PEELED out and whipped around the corner as if chased by demons. \n\n\"He was nice, Dad!\"\n\n\"Most cops are nice, I hope he gets those seedlings home okay. Hand me the flat screwdriver?\"\n\nDad scooted back under the car, and I laid down on the driveway to keep chatting with him. I miss it. \n\n",

        "text": "There was a time when I lived in a small, very safe and very quiet community.  There was a patch of woods very near my house that was owned by the city.  People were allowed to walk in the woods or just be there.  In these woods, there were many trees that had fallen down from old age, storms, whatever. I had a fire pit that I would use when I had friends over. But to use this, I needed wood.  Me, being young and spry at the time decided I would cut my own wood.\n\n\nI did this several times without issue. However, one time as I am cutting with my friends, I hear someone approach and call out behind me.  It’s an officer. He asks us what we’re doing; I tell him I’m cutting wood for my fire pit.   I gotta say, he was real nice about it, informed us that someone called in a complaint etc.  After talking to us he went back to his car.  I was near enough to the road to see that three other squad cars had pulled up.  That is to say, the entire patrol of my city was here to investigate a kid cutting wood. Mind you, I was using only a handsaw, a wheelbarrow, and an axe and only collecting trees that had fallen, so it was not some major harvesting operation.\n\n\nThe original officer proceeded to go and knock on every neighbor’s door and ask them about me, what I was doing etc. while the other two just sat in their cars. Eventually he comes back and says that there’s really no issue, but he had to investigate anyways. He and the others left and I continued what I was doing. It really bothers me though that someone thought to call the police on me.  Imagine that instead of spending my hard earned cash on a pitiful amount of wood from a gas station, I would gather it myself. What a novel concept! This is why kids don’t go out and play anymore, because people call the cops on them for doing nothing wrong. If this is you please stop, for our future’s sake\n",
