A little library, similar to a birdhouse, that contain books.](https://littlefreelibrary.org)\n\nPerhaps we could do this as a subreddit? Create \"Chapo Trap Libraries\" for our working class communities?\n\nMy idea is to build one, as it'd be at most half the price of those sold online. It'd likely have three small shelves : \n\n1. Political/History, focusing on leftist novels and authors. \n\n2. Various genres, but quality fictional works. Classics, Fantasy, Sci Fi, Historical Fiction, etc... \n\n3. The most important shelf : Children's books. \n\nIt'd run on a donations system. If you take a book, it'd be suggested but not demanded that you \"pay\" with another book. Possibly there'd be a patreon or just PayPal account where cash donations could go. Which would go towards refilling the library. Or, if full, would be put towards creating more little leftist libraries in town. Or, if that goal is reached? Possibly used for other community goals.\n\nThe ultimate goal would be to have one self-sustaining little library (that I add leftist lit to) in each part of my small town.",
