        "text": "Hi all,\n\nI finally got around to watching Call Me by Your Name and really enjoyed it. I thought the direction and performances were stellar and was emotionally affected by it but I did have some issues with the film and thought I'd see what other peoples thoughts were.\n\nThe age difference. \n\nI know the actors have addressed this in interviews and it's generally been considered a nonissue. However, it still bothered me. As a young high school teacher with about the same age difference between myself and my students i couldn't help but look at Oliver's actions and attraction to Elio to be the behavior of a stunted individual, at the very best. But the relationship and character wasn't really presented in that way. To add to this, Armie Hammer looks his age and Timothy looks to be the age of the character. Did this bother anyone else?\n\nThe peach scene\n\nI suppose this might just be a matter of taste but I'm stuggling to see what this scene added to the film. The fact that peaches have most oftenly been symbolic of female sexuality added extra confusion to a scene that I felt was ultimately unnecessary. \n\nThe father's monologue\n\nExpertly delivered and one of, if not my favorite scene in the film however after thinking about the lines later i had some questions. \n\nElio's father tell him that his relationship with Oliver was a powerful thing and that he should allow himself to feel the emotions he needs to. He also says that he never had any relationship of the same substance. Perhaps this is more my personal reading of the film but Elio and Oliver's relationship reminded me more of teenage summer flings. Beautiful and intense and passionate but really more so because of my age and it being first experiences and not because of the relationship itself. I felt as though the film captured this kind of relationship but the father seems to ascribe more weight to it. What do you all think? \n\n\n",

        "author": "96mm",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/7soan2/three_billboards_outside_ebbing_missouri_a_review/",
        "text": "So before I begin blabbing on, I want to clarify that because I want to discuss existing themes and scenes in the film that this review will contain some spoilers.\n\nSo after eagerly awaiting its release in the UK, as soon as I could get the time I went to the cinema last night and watched Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. \n\nI've never seen any other of Martin McDonagh's films, and from what I've absorbed through this piece of work is that he is a director and writer that is more than capable of presenting a story which dances substantially between dark and comical themes. This film is painted with ironic humour and tonal flickers, relying heavily on the use of contrasting emotions that jumps from comical and enlightening scenes to stern and cold tension. This is highly notable through the interrogation scene, the mother and daughter argument scene and the cereal flick to the face scene, which for the most part transitions very well, and I think McDonagh has found a good balance in executing this method. To me, I found the mother and daughter argument scene to be exceptionally effective and after briefly reading through some other existing discussions I've gathered that this is perhaps a less popular opinion. My reasoning to why I think this was such a great scene is that first of all, it embeds the fact Frances McDormand's character, Mildred is a flawed person that makes illogical decisions and will perhaps continue to do so and secondly, because it shows very well what kind of family they are. Some families argue a lot, to the point where exchanging horrendous insults becomes almost meaningless and way too common. This is represented through Mildred's final insult to Angela before she leaves the house and it grounds the type of relationship they share through that one, short scene which is why I believe it was done so well. \n\nGoing back to the film's transitioning of jumping from dark to comical tones, a minor issue I had was that sometimes it was not necessary at all and it had the tendency to kill the tension in serious scenes which could have perhaps better been left off to be... serious. The cereal flick to the face moment jumped from having a sincerely joyous beginning switching to a tense mood after the addition of John Hawkes' (Charlie) character's presence, to only jump back into a comical tone as the 19 year old girlfriend of Charlie pops in to use the toilet. For me this completely stripped away the tension and grim introduction of Charlie's character and even afterwards the movie didn't make an effort to clarify that in fact, Charlie is a horrible individual. Although I felt that John Hawkes delivered the character well, in this specific area the script made it difficult for me to become fully immersed in Charlie's personality, especially as his 19 year old girlfriend is presented with no visible bruises or evidence of abuse whatsoever and is even treated to a decent meal at a nice restaurant more than halfway through the movie. \n\nI found that the script was mildly culpable of falling short into this issue with some of the other characters as well, more noticeably this occurred for Sam Rockwell’s character, Dixon. Although it can be argued that Dixon was following a slow and gradual arch, which eventually leads him into being a ‘decent’ human being, I personally didn’t interpret it this way. I found Dixon’s switch in personal motives to be rather sudden, all from one letter from a person that obviously meant a hell of a lot to him. Another oddity that I found distracting was the mystery figure that apparently pops into small obscure towns in Missouri and openly brags about raping people. Was this just a lazy way of playing upon the irony of Woody Harrelson’s (Willoughby) letter where he states that culprits can be caught simply from eavesdropping on a conversation in a bar? To provide a premise to further support Dixon’s change? This is a portion of the film, which I believe could have definitely been better executed; however this is just a minor complaint. In fact, I think most of the characters in this movie were fantastic, the interaction of these characters in this small town felt very genuine and convincing which I think was made possible through McDonagh’s excellent dialogue writing and the performance of the actors. I thought Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell were both excellent in this movie and provided the audience with a truly organic performance.\n\nVisually I found the film to be completely capable of being beautiful, this was evident through some of the shots in the opening scenes, however inconsistency within the camera work definitely falls to be a flaw within this film. To focus the whole plot set in one small town, and still provide depth and variation in the camerawork I think proves to be a difficult challenge. In fact, I would be lying to say that this film achieves visual awe but I couldn't discredit the camerawork, I felt as if some of the best shots usually occurred around the three billboards, which I suppose is a nice touch but nothing that truly adds eloquent depth to the film's visual presence. \n\nPersonally, I didn’t find the score of the film to be that impactful or memorable, although it suited the premise of the film and I had no actual issues with it, I just found it to be more of a wasted opportunity than anything else. I know this is a lazy and brief summary of the visual and auditory side to the film but I found the plot and characters to be the biggest fascination of this movie and therefore warranted a much more detailed review. \n\nThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri utilises a collaborative effort and forms a comical yet dark and sometimes heart warming story from the coherence of various individuals, that all face different lives burdened with different issues. \n\nWhat did you guys make of the film?",

        "text": "Wow. Just wow. This may be my new favorite film. Absolutely beautiful, emotional, and gross. \n\nI was astounded by the accurate portrayal of borderline/histrionic personality disorder with Sissy. It was sick and it was obvious she had done her homework. \n\nBrandon's sex addiction really gave me a look into a more realistic world of the addiction. It is easy to see the difference between his behaviors and normal sexual behavior.\n\n\nThe subtle parts about their childhood really intrigued me. Brandon alludes once to a borderline abusive situation while on a date (which I believe makes him feel vulnerable) when his cousin threw him into the ceiling and he passed out for \"5-10 minutes\" Like, holy shit, he's gotta have some brain damage. Couple that with the research that most people with borderline/histrionic disorders were abused in some way as a child, and it's pretty obvious that they came from an abusive household. Both of their preoccupations with sex (Sissy's incestuous behavior towards Brandon) and I feel like it becomes pretty obvious throughout the movie. The scene where they watch cartoons shows how they sometimes revert back into children during difficult times.\n\n\nI am eager to hear other people's thoughts on this subject. Knowing what I know, it was difficult for me not to imagine how fucked up their childhood was the whole time.",

I am trying to see if any others agree with my interpretation /could explain to me a couple of the camera decisions In Sacred.Deer. Specifically I am referring to the high and low camera angles that seem to be switched between in Collin Farrel's scenes.  It seemed to me that when Barry keoghan was not around,  the camera was usually positioned above Farrel. I believe this was done to show his confidence and belief that he was in control of his life, and of the situations around him. I believe that the angles where the camera was looking up at him, especially both towards the end of the film and any time keoghan was in frame, were symbolic of Farrell no longer being in control of events. This may be overly simplistic,  or just shitty analysis, but any discussion /feedback on my film analysis and how to get better at it is welcome!",

        "text": "So there's a post about how Call Me By Your Name is actually dominated by a reactionary and bourgeois ideology. It's a really interesting post, so I'm surprised a lot of people are attacking it for frivolous reasons, many acting as if class analysis is something trivial in film criticism (it's anything but).\n\nAnyways, I do actually ultimately disagree with the post in question. I think Call Me By Your Name is actually a politically progressive film that comments on the rise of neoliberal and postmodern thought (Remember, this film takes place in the early 80s).\n\nThe scenes in question are very short and you can miss them very easily. There is one where the old servants are talking amongst themselves. If you pay attention to what they're saying, they're actually lamenting the death of revolutionary politics. They thank god for the partisans and talk disapprovingly about what has become of politics these days (All of this is not in the script, I'm assuming it was added by Luca Guadagnino after). On the other end of the spectrum altogether, we see a woman with a portrait of Mussolini, representing far-right reaction.\n\nOne very important scene comes with the two loud mouthed guests who are sitting down at the table with the parents. They ask them their thoughts on the new government with 5 parties, but the parents are indifferent. The guests are shocked, remarking that they've changed, especially now that they live in this new house. This also seems to have been added by Guadagnino, who is actually criticizing the parents here. The parents, he shows, are very much ivory-tower intellectuals who are becoming detached from politics as we enter the neoliberal era. The parents are in many ways represent the disappointed generation of '68 in Europe, who used to be radical but are now replacing class struggle for postmodern thinking.\n\nSo while yes, the original story would have undoubtedly had a bourgeois character to it, Guadagnino has changed the outlook of the film by throwing in a few very short political sequences to it. I'm pretty sure there's more but I've just forgotten, so if anyone wants to add anything that would greatly be appreciated!",

        "text": "Hello r/TrueFilm\n\nThe Oscar nominations are coming out tomorrow, so I thought now would be a good time to air my biggest grievance with the show's history: it's handling of cinematography/editing nominations.\n\nMore times than not, the films nominated in these categories seem to just be pulled from the Best Picture nominations with seemingly no consideration given to other films that year.\n\nSure, it'd make sense that the \"best\" films of the year have good cinematography and editing, but more times than not there are many films that, while perhaps not as well-rounded as a Best Picture nominee, take far larger strides in their camerawork, lighting and editing. \n\nPrime example: In 2010, The King's Speech is nominated for Best Picture and therefore gets arbitrary Best Cinematography and Editing nominations. The same year ENTER THE VOID came out. I can see the Academy not liking Enter the Void's writing or even direction, but there is no denying that Enter the Void did far more with both Editing and Cinematography than The King's fucking Speech. Sure, films like Birdman and The Revenant earned their recognition in all categories, but rarely do these Oscar-bait biopic/dramas do anything remarkable with their technical elements.\n\nIf Three Billboards gets Cinematography and/or Editing nominations tomorrow I'm going to want to die. That film did NOTHING with it's cinematography or editing to convey it's story. In a year where Killing of A Sacred Deer and mother! made bold, stylistic choices in both cinematography and editing, seeing something playing it so safe get nominated would kill me. Good Time would deserve recognition beyond most of the Oscar frontrunners even! \n\nI'm fine with Oscar-bait films getting Best Picture nominations, it's all a popularity contest, but I just wish the biggest award show in the world could take a moment to actually commend the films taking steps forward in new directions for the medium.\n\nAny other good examples of this trend of incredible technical films losing out the nomination to seemingly random Best Picture frontrunners? \n\nIf the Oscars weren't all about popularity, which films this year do you think had truly noteworthy Cinematography or Editing deserving of the nomination?",

        "text": "[Pier Paolo Pasolini once remarked](https://youtu.be/5IA1bS1MRzw?t=1m54s) how both the lower uneducated class and the highly cultured class contain a certain poetic grace. He contrasts this to the culture of the bourgeoisie, where this grace is lost and vulgarity remains. This corruption consists of espousing the ideals consistent with a life within a technical system, where the individual is subjugated to increase overall efficiency of production. To perpetuate this cycle the produced commodities and experiences need to be consumed. What Pasolini sees as vulgarity therefore is an uncritical embrace of consumerist values. This is concurrent with a proliferation of consumerist lifestyles within culture itself. The [culture industry](http://www.sociosite.net/topics/texts/adorno_culture_reconsidered.pdf) produces works of art that reflect this bourgeois life of consumerism. These works engender an implicit acceptance of the current circumstances in which the individual lives as a natural given. \n\n\n*Call Me By Your Name* is a prime example of the insidiousness of bourgeois art. In its embrace of bourgeois vulgarity it buries all questions of political importance. It is as the peach the character of Elio uses in the film itself. It may look appetizing on the surface, but one bite reveals the dirty material covered within. \n\n\nThe reason *Call Me By Your Name* can be called out as such is because on a technical level it is extremely well made. It is a moving version of the most picturesque post card one can find in holiday paradise. The screenplay by James Ivory tells the sexual awakening of Elio and blossoming relationship with the older research student Oliver who is visiting Elio’s father in a lyrical manner. The languid images evoke the warmth and tranquility of summer in Northern Italy perfectly. The bodies of Elio and Oliver are shown with an elegance that is clearly indebted to the ancient Greek statues that Oliver scavenges with Elio’s father. The love story is touching in no small part due to Timothée Chalamets naive bravado as Elio and Arnie Hammers endearing arrogance as Oliver. They fit together as hands in a glove. It is commendable as well that the friends and parents of Elio are accepting of his homosexuality. It would have been the easy way out to generate dramatic conflict by making Elio ostracized. In short, director Luca Guadagnino managed to create a seductive love fantasy.\n\n\nBut it is precisely in this effervescent seduction of a perfect coming-of-age story that *Call Me By Your Name* is a pernicious deed of filmmaking. In being the ultimate apolitical fantasy, it quietly turns political. Pivotal is the scene where Elio and Oliver are circling around a statue built in remembrance of the First World War. The suffering that this statue represents is used as a superficial metaphor for their inner struggles. However, this kind of shallow symbolism, aptly criticized by [Roland Barthes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51715.Mythologies), is not the main issue of the film. It is merely illustrative for the way in which any kind of problem the individual may have is seen in isolation, instead of being embedded in a specific social context. \n\n\nThe life Elio lives is depicted as completely natural. This is tied directly to the seductive picture post card that this film is. The dependence on servants, a struggling working class or the small towns that only thrive under tourism, issues such as these are nonexistent. Elio’s parents seem of the armchair socialist kind, cosmopolitan in their thinking but firmly holed up in an ivory tower. *Call Me By Your Name* suggests as if everyone can live the life of Elio’s family, whereas this is a privilege that only a few can attain. It suggests as if taking a holiday consuming experiences is a normal and desirable way of life, forgoing any alternative way society could be arranged.\n\n\nOne can posit that not all films need to directly address political questions. However, the point is that all works of art are embedded in a social context. The strongest works will make one question this context in a critical manner by telling an engaging story. Addressing politics directly is a hindrance to telling this engaging story. But sweeping all political issues under the rug is undesirable as well. One could also posit that *Call Me By Your Name* is meant as an escapist fantasy. But not all fantasies need end in acquiescence to the status quo. The romantic fantasy of *Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans* with its cheerful exuberance manages to posit important questions on the human condition, from city life to the meaning of love. *Call Me By Your Name* misses the important questions. Just like a lazy summer vacation, it will be shed off the minute one sets foot in the office again. ",

        "text": "\"Pretentious\"\n\nThat's a word we can hear by critics and movie lovers to describe specific films, specific filmmakers and even specific genres. I personally don't like this word for the most part of film discussion, because I think is pretentious and  pseudo-intellectualism to consider something pretentious just because you can't think about more deeply about a movie so you have to consider it pretentious. Or just because the filmmaker's worldview doesn't match with your personal worldview, so you have to consider it pretentious.\n\nBut, at the other hand, I have been thinking about if there is some validity in consider some work from cinema, literature, music etc, as pretentious. And if there is some validity, when we can use that word. \n\nWhat would be the criteria to consider something \"pretentious\"? When we can consider some movie as pretentious? How can we differ a truly artistic film that has being misunderstood and underappreciated by the critics and the audience and film full of self-indulgence and doesn't have nothing profound to say? What is the difference between a Kubrick, Bergman,Tarkovsky and some filmmaker that just want attention and nothing else? What would be your personal criteria? \n\nWhat examples you can mention as misunderstood artistic masterpieces and examples of pseudoartistic films and filmmakers?\n\nObviously that depends of personal taste and other circumstances. Filmmakers like Hitchcock or movies like Eyes Wide Shut were underappreciated in their times and now are considered as timeless classics. Especially Eyes Wide Shut, that seems just now I have been seeing recognize it as one of Kubrik's best films. ",

What I'm curious is how much weight does this critique hold in favor of the bigger picture for a film. If a film is riddled with unexplainable events or character actions, does that hurt it because of how messy it may seem.

There's nothing intrinsically bad in focusing on cinema's easily digestible staples. I've just been asked several times by many genuinely interested people about more sophisticated art films. What films wouldn't scare or turn them off? What films would best gradually ease them into filmic languages that are both unforgiving and challenging. Perceived\npretentiousness is also a killer. An art film with little to no ostentation would be ideal. \n\nI was considering these titles:\n\n1. A Clockwork Orange (I think Kubrick's films are so multi-levelled that anyone can find value in them from different degrees of depth. The deeper you dive, the more rewarding his films are. It doesn't take much to find value in Kubrick.)\n\n2. The Seventh Seal (I've had luck with this Bergman classic in the past. It has converted a handful of my friends into true believers, lol. I think the themes are so important to so many people and Bergman's visual poetics are vivid and powerful.)\n\n3. Breathless (While they may not absolutely love the film, Godard's rebel yell of an experiment never fails to entertain viewers.)\n\n4. The Rules of the Game (I simply find this mammoth masterwork irresistible no matter WHO you are.)\n\nWhat are some films that you might recommend to someone who might not know too much about more obscure or challenging films?",

You heard that right, not 1.33:1, not 1.85:1, not even 2.39:1, this is an aspect ratio I’ve never seen! According to the DP, Philippe Le Sourd, they shot the film at this strange aspect ratio to focus on body language. I don’t really understand that reasoning. Every time an amateur does something neat just for the sake of it and are confronted about it, they always come up with some crazy excuse for doing it. I need to focus on the body language. Yeah because you can’t focus on body language in 1.85 or 2.39. Body language is exclusive to 1.66. This is the same reasoning Quinten Terentino used in reference to hateful eight’s use of 70mm, he said it allows you to fit more people in one frame, so it draws your attention and lets your eye explore the canvas. It’s all arbitrary and dumb. It’s like Aronofsky over explaining mother!, it’s fine if the aspect ratio actually does communicate something other than “Hey look at me! I’m such a cool DP” but if it doesn’t, there’s an issue. If the audience doesn’t get something out of this aspect ratio, if mood, emotion, or information is not communicated through this aspect ratio, then all of the explaining in the world won’t fix it. When asked why he shot on film Pepe said, “When you’re painting with that brush it gives your work a different texture.” wow. What an insane revolutionary thing to say. Wow. just like the aspect ratio, why does he need to explain this?! Every time a DP explains why they shot on film it’s the exact same excuse, “It gives it texture. It gives it nostalgia. I like the colors.” It’s DUMB! Just shoot on whatever the project calls for and see what the audience gets from it! If they don’t absorb mood, information, or emotion from it then what’s the point? Here’s another thing I absolutely hate about this DP, when asked about artistic influences, which is a stupid question in the first place, he responded, “One of our references was Kurosawa’s ‘Rashomon,’\" ugh I hate when directors think they’re smart by saying they’re influenced by classic directors. I’ve got an idea for ya, how about instead of leeching off of others, you become someone others leech off of. It’s like when Zaddy Snyder compared Justice League to Seven Samurai. What in the land?! The DP also said that he framed Colin Firth to look like an object rather than a man to feed into the whole “feminist” theme. I didn’t see that but maybe I missed something. I don’t know. He just looked like Colin Firth to me. Just a guy. Anywho… there was a noticeable lack of camera movement in the film, which forces it to become more about the composition and the mise en scene than flashy movements.  It forces the viewer to put some work in. Speaking of the mis en sene, a majority of the wide and master shots in the film look like a live painting. It’s become a huge cliche but there’s something Barry Lyndon esque to the staging and compositions of some of these shots. There’s clear effort put in to make these shots meaningful and emotional as well as visually interesting. Unfortunately, they don’t let those shots hang for more than a couple of fleeting seconds, so the audience can’t fully absorb the beauty of them. These wide shots are juxtaposed with sloppy inserts, profiles, and mediums; there’s so much needless dead space in these shots it seems amateurish. The cuts themselves are jarring as well, the emotional beat of the scene and the literal beat of the editing don’t sync up at all. The use of natural light paired with vintage lenses and 35mm film in a unique aspect ratio lead to the appealing and meaningful visual language of this film. \n\n.\n\n\nThe Beguiled was originally a 1966 book which was adapted into a 1971 pulpy exploitation film which is now the 2017 Sofia Coppola directed subdued feminist… thing. In an attempt to make the material “subtler,” she has amputated its essential charge. It’s not that the film lacks sex or stemness, it doesn’t lack edge, it lacks themes, intrigue, drama, and CONFLICT! If you don’t have conflict in your logline (and therefore your screenplay), you probably have a boring screenplay. Movies are about conflict. You never write the logline, “Bob tells his wife he wants a divorce. And she’s fine with it.” You write, “Bob tries to divorce his wife, who threatens to kill him if he does.” Sofia Coppola isn’t exactly Miss Plot, but there’s a certain level of drama expected with every movie, twists and turns that make you curious and keen to keep watching. There’s none of that here. Much like the rest of her movies, The Beguiled  is obnoxiously repetitive, predictable, and empty. We’ve got characters we don’t like in a script with no story? I don’t care if you’re the best filmmaker in the world, if you add the greatest cinematography and the world’s prettiest actresses – the movie’s screwed. Some bozo on Reddit wrote this gem, “This is Get Out for any woman who's dealt with predatory, smarmy, 'nice guy'” no it’s not because Get Out had interesting characters, drama, conflict, and social commentary. It’s not an interesting story. It tries to be tense but it was  predictable due to the one dimensional character motivations. There's a fairly large main cast in a short movie, no one develops. There’s no character! It felt incomplete. Like it was building up to something that never came through. None of its supposed feminist themes were communicated at all. “From a filmmaking perspective, though, The Beguiled is on point.’ No it’s not! This is from a review that in the title described The Beguiled as “mundane” and “much ado about nothing” Seems much too positive to praise the film from a “filmmaking perspective.” The whole point of film is to communicate themes! And if those themes suck, like the article suggests, then the filmmaking sucks! What does that even mean, from a filmmaking perspective? From a technical perspective? From a cinematography perspective? Surely not from a screenwriting perspective. There are so many moments of this film that just don’t land, like when Colin Firth blurts out his love for one of the women but their bond doesn’t draws us in emotionally. Nothing in the movie does. McBurney’s act of betrayal. The pivotal moment of the film, yet it’s staged with little power; Coppola all but throws it away. It’s an odd choice, but it’s telling, because at that moment “The Beguiled” reveals the kind of movie it really is: not a roiling, dramatic, tempestuous one but, a rather schematic one. The amputating of McBurney’s leg is the central event of the story, in the 1971 version it was a grisly act of symbolic castration. Here, Coppola hasn’t given Martha the necessary backstory to justify her character’s feelings of solitude or vengeful jealousy. Therefore, during a loud scene when Colin Firth lashes out and claims his fall down the stairs and surgery was revenge for not going to bed with Edwina or Martha, this moment, along with the film as a whole, seems emotionally unjustified. Coppola keeps everything subdued to such a degree that when the situation needs to explode, it feels as though the bomb goes off without the wick having been lit. Which is decidedly not lit. In the original book as well as the 1971 film, there is a slave character named Hallie who was most definitely not treated well by the characters or the author, who has been removed entirely by Coppola reportedly because of two reasons, 1) Slavery is a topic too big to tackle, and she wanted to focus on the gender issues. And 2) She doesn’t want young girls watching a slave. White feminists have praised her decision to “stay in her lane” yeah, removing a black character entirely instead of giving her actual character is good. Removing someone’s story instead of giving them story is good. Sophia Coppola, the epitome of rich white feminism making a movie about women in the confederate south is a good idea. Invalidating someone’s opinion because of who they are is a good idea. Hold the phone, people! This just in, apparently I can only make films about middle class white teenage boys living in rural Minnesota! The sentiment is there, don’t write about things you know nothing about, but maybe get someone who does, or hire a writer, or LEARN about their perspectives?! By ignoring these critical perspectives, Coppola is effectively saying, \"Ignoring slavery is good.Only black filmmakers can make movies with black people in them so they can stay in their lane.\" Coppola has characterized slavery as a topic too big to nail. But she doesn’t nail anything in this film, why not nail something?! Her solution to this whole slavery problem, rather than writing a script that adequately addresses the issue, was to omit any black characters from a Southern tale about the Civil War. Coppola puts any notion of slavery out of mind, which forces one to consider why she wouldn’t just choose a different historical era and setting for the film. Erasing people of color in favor of white female narratives is neither empowering nor feminist. Let’s take a moment to clarify that 76% of all female characters were white in the top 100 films of 2016. 14% were Black, 6% were Asian, and 3% were Latina. For a film so hell-bent on exposing this uniquely female story, it’s a shame that the filmmakers intentionally removed an African American character in order to turn this film into nothing more than the physical manifestation of white liberal feminism. There’s this curiously over-sympathetic attitude toward Southern Confederate white women who were slave-owners. It’s a perspective that, needless to say, is inappropriate given the state of America today.  Coppola explained that she was drawn to The Beguiled’s narrative because she’s \"always loved the women in the South\" — as if black Southern women aren’t “women in the South.” This pure white southern belle femininity is a figure that romanticizes the economic prosperity that was built off of slave labor—she cannot exist without the slave. Their so-called “proper” femininity cannot be separated from that of the black woman, as invisible as she is in this film. Coppola didn’t want to portray the protagonists of her “white [girl] power” film as women who were A-OK with owning slaves.\n\n.\n\n\nVariety points out that in an attempt to elevate the material, Coppola doesn’t realize that “The Beguiled” is, and always was, pulp. Now it’s pulp with the juice squeezed out of it. I’d like to leave you with a quote from the auteur Sofia Coppola, “Writing is hard for me.” \n\n.\n\nFor more analyses, visit www.napkinsunite.weebly.com or https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCayv3vxahFLvpjG0vzHp9cg",

There's still much I'm pondering and I can't wait to rewatch it, but here's a first thought that I haven't seen talked about much yet.\n\nWhen Reynolds meets Alma he takes the paper she was writing his order on and asks if she remembers it. She says yes and he says he's keeping the paper. At first this looks like a smooth flirting move, but later we realize that he's making sure she listens well and will learn how he likes things.\n\nWhen they move in together, the tug of war on how she fits into his life begins. Will she completely make herself subservient to him or will she force him to accommodate to her as well? \n\nCyril states that he hates excessive butter and also tells her that he won't like her surprise. Alma knows both things,  but she goes ahead with her surprise and she makes the asparagus with a butter sauce.\n\nThese aren't mistakes on her part, she's doing it intentionally to force him to pay attention to her the way he wants to be paid attention to. By the end of the movie he's watching her every move. And she makes a big show of plopping a lot of butter into the pan with his omelette. She does this so that he won't eat too much of it, but only enough to make him sick.\n\nThe only thing that I found a little lacking was that there was never a moment (that I saw) where he began to suspect Alma was up to something. I also need to think more on the mommy issues, but this is what I've got so far. ",

What would that look like?\n\nAs for the second question, would it add anything to the film to show where exactly Borden and Angier are economically compared to others? We're given more than enough info to know they're doing well, but there's also this allusion to people worth off that feels relevant, but isn't the focus of the story.

        "text": "I love this film. I made a pretty good video analysis of it:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/xVhkA4N1tFo\n\nPlease, give that video a watch. I actually think it's a decent take on Michael Mann. \n\nFive years ago, I was known as a traveler. I was reading a little too much Kerouac, listening to one too many punk rock songs about how highways can symbolize freedom, and before I knew it I was hitting the open road, with nothing but a backpack and a guitar to my name. I was a hitchhiker, I was a journeyer, and I was on a life-or-death voyage throughout the United States. A part of me blames Alexander Supertramp for this juvenile excursion into danger but I know in my heart of hearts that I had a genuine death wish when I was young. I also had a drive to find something beautiful, something that couldn't be contained in a poem or in a film. I was searching for meaning. I was searching for Los Angeles.\n\nMany times throughout my odyssey, I would sleep on different couches in different states that belonged to many different wonderful people, but there were also plenty of times where I resorted to sleeping on sidewalks and park benches. What surprised me most was how many young travelers there were just like me. I met someone of particular importance in Denver and he said something I will never forget. He called himself a city hiker. He said, \"the skyline was mine to conquer.\" He told me how cities have their own heartbeat and their own mountains. He told me that cities were harder to scale than natural cliffs because the terrain of a city is much more perilous. He even talked about the different regions of a city and their comparative similarities to ones found in nature. I never thought about things in this way before. I decided that the next city I would call my home, I would climb to its internal peak and ascend it. The next city on my list was Los Angeles. It was a city that would have swallowed me whole if I hadn't ran away from it when I did. It's a city unlike any other city on the face of the earth. It's powerful and it's hungry. It was home.\n\nCollateral is the story of Los Angeles. It is a city I know well. I know its features like I know myself. I'll never forget the feeling of the place, the look of physical detachment, and the glittering skyscrapers that littered every inch of it. I'll always remember that the best people and the worst people in the world can both be found there. Michael Mann captured modern Los Angeles strikingly and Collateral exudes the same emotions that the city does. There is an absorbing quality true of Michael Mann's work. You get the sense that he is the supreme architect of Los Angeles. In a way, he most certainly is.\n\nMichael Mann's genius is all about creating an absolute sense of atmosphere. Nobody can capture L.A. like Michael Mann does. He understands it intimately on a poetically physical level. No one understands the personality of Los Angeles as well as he does. Collateral is all about orchestration.\n\nMax's cab ride with Vincent, much like Antonius Block's chess game with Death, is emblematic of a greater grandeur. Max is a self-described night-owl, he knows Los Angeles like the back of his hand, and he's managed to memorize every possible thing about the city. When the film begins, the sun is setting, almost because of Max turning the key in the cab's engine. Los Angeles looks very different at night, it looks better in a lot of ways, but it takes a special kind of somebody to immerse himself in it the way Max does every night. In Michael Mann's film, symbolism is strong, and every character and event is close to parabolic. Max is a physical representation of the Night. He is the dark of Los Angeles. He is full of unfulfilled dreams and wasted potential but he is also an authentically good soul. Death hunts his prey in the cover of Night. Vincent is that kind of predator.\n\nCollateral is a film about Death's car ride with Night. It works on several distinct levels as Death forces the (k)Night to question his place in the universe. Death makes Night an unwilling accomplice, he makes him a witness to his arrival, and debates with him the significance of the cosmic plane. Death takes him on a very important series of trials. He shows him The Five Trials Of Man: sleaze, greed, envy, vanity, and purity. Each person Death comes for is representative of a basic human failure.\n\nWhile the Night has been fully humanized, Death lacks an empathetic capacity for emotional reasoning. He suffers from a malignant form of sociopathy and is nearly mechanical in his operations. Killing is his job and he does it well. It is his only function. Pontificating and philosophizing in Max's backseat is the one true area of free will he expresses. He moves with total efficiency, except when he is challenged by another formidable force; the Nighttime. When the Night challenges Death, he becomes damaged and unsystematic in his hunting methods. He never becomes humanized because human emotion is the one thing Death will never understand. He does not respect the human race or identify with it. He operates on a higher cosmic plane and answers to an unseen, omnipotent force; an agency shrouded in Darkness.\n\nThe Nighttime is the only symbol that can counter Death. There is nothing inherently cruel about the Night, it can be full of dreams and wishes. Death recognizes the fanciful nature of the Nighttime and attempts to dispel it. He wants the Night to acknowledge its plight. He wants to show him the ultimate truth about the human condition. He wants to tell him about detachment and open his eyes to the unvarnished reality of man. In Death's eyes, mankind is constantly on trial and understandably found guilty of being just as cold as their creator created them to be. Death views itself as omnipresent, as some sort of all-knowing specter. Vincent can and does feel. He ignores the emotions and forgets they happened to him. He takes the Night by the hand and makes his rounds. There was always something so impermanent about Death, maybe in his features, almost like he understood the temporary function of his current identity. Sometimes Vincent exudes deeper feeling than Max does. Then again, sometimes Death is all about emotion. Death and Night both claim to understand Los Angeles perfectly well. Both of them are correct in their observations. Los Angeles is a morally ambiguous place, not without complexity.\n\nDetective Fanning is a symbol of Man. He represents the ambition and tragic heroism that Man gets so easily swept away with. He is the most human character in Michael Mann's piece. Some would also say that he was also the most unimportant, that outside of flagrant exposition, Fanning had no narrative significance. These critics are overlooking the stark symbolism of his character. He is the potential that mankind has to be something greater than they are. It is a potential to be great that is false and sadly unformed. Collateral is about the vitality of man despite human frailty and Fanning is a direct symbol of this contrast. It's about Man's inability to comprehend the idea of Death. It's about the human impossibility of anticipating a personal extinction. It's about the tragedy in life that produces false heroes. It's about thinking you're the star of a film that actually has no need for your presence.\n\nAnnie Farrell is about Hope. She's all about the solace found in dreams. She's been providing so many promises to a city absent of any, that she needs a vacation. The Night is the perfect companion for the Hope of the city. He believes in her and she believes in him. She is symbolic of desire, possibilities, and figurative contentment. She's that last shining light in Los Angeles, the one that's always on no matter what. She's mankind's only hope for salvation. Man needs Hope in order to survive. Los Angeles needs her in order to function. Everyone and everything needs hope, even Death. She's worth living for, worth dying for, and worth killing for. She is the heart of our cosmic plane. She is the key. Night will protect her from the cruel methods of Death. Night would sacrifice himself for Hope's well-being. The existence of Man relies solely on abstraction. Hope can never die, Death can never be allowed to prevail, and the Nighttime needs its city to be atoned.\n\nCollateral ends with the covenant of daybreak. It ends with the idea of Hope reborn and promises anew. Nothing is worse than it was before but something just a little bit better has been gained from the night Death came to visit. The city is still about detachment and indifference. The people in it are still about disinterest and phony personal routines. Yet the darkness has been vanquished from the city, at least for a while. Man has found what is truly important. It is Hope. It's looking the omnipotent in the eye and taking your shot. It's about finding a reason to die and, by extension of that discovery, finding a reason to live. Albert Camus once wrote, \"I see many people die because they judge that life is not worth living. I see others paradoxically getting killed for the ideas or illusions that give them a reason for living (what is called a reason for living is also an excellent reason for dying). I therefore conclude that the meaning of life is the most urgent of questions.\" Michael Mann counters Camus' remarks with one of his own: Man is his own reason for living. Man has the ability to personify all of the abstractions that give meaning to all things and can understand them deeply when these illusions are given physical anonymity and anatomy. Man can transcend Camus' most urgent question. In battle with omnipresent forces in human forms, Man gains a deeper understanding of his own physical poetry. Los Angeles isn't purgatory, it is neither heaven nor hell. Los Angeles is Los Angeles. It's a city built by Man, emblematic of nothing. Los Angeles is the way that it is only because of the way people are. The fellow traveler I met it Denver was absolutely wrong. Cities are not omnipotent beings, they are comprised of lifeless monuments. It is mankind that propels them into motion. It is Man that gives a city life.\n\nCollateral is composed in visual free-hand. You get the sense that Michael Mann is experimenting with atmosphere, searching for a seamless technique that just won't make itself available to him. There are instances of poor photography that I don't believe were entirely accidental, but a result of Mann's increasingly experimental nature of forms (which he would master in 2006's Miami Vice). I think that Mann has established his genius several times before and Collateral marks an intriguing departure for the visual aesthete. Mann is no longer concerned with anything other than pure atmosphere. Whether or not Collateral has a systematic technical scheme is not worth investigating. The only thing that matters is whether or not Collateral absorbs you in its technical character.\n\nCollateral is a film that chewed me up and spat me out. I was sucked inside of its simple splendor. This is Mann's atmospheric devotion. It is a film that invokes the authentic tone of Los Angeles as a whole. Every time I watch it, I'm visiting the place. Collateral transports you directly into the heart of L.A. and guides you through a labyrinthine sequence of symbolism. Collateral has all of the physical properties of Los Angeles itself. Somehow Michael Mann figured out how to capture the true essence of the city. Collateral is Los Angeles county. You are watching something genuine. You are watching something poetic and real. You are watching Los Angeles. You are watching art. \n\nWhere Collateral falls within my favorite Michael Mann films:\n\n1. Manhunter\n\n2. Miami Vice\n\n3. Heat\n\n4. Thief\n\n5. Collateral",

I've heard many people say, it is the most accessible Kurosawa film. It isn't too hard to see why. \n\nThe film starts off wonderfully, putting into perspective what it meant to be a samurai in the final years of the Tokugawa Shogunate. At this period in Japanese history, many samurai were unemployed, roaming around the Japanese countryside in search of employment. \n\nThe opening scene in which Sanjuro leaves his fate to a stick thrown in the air, really signifies the state Samurai were in at this period in history. Kurosawa displayed the character's attitude in one short little sequence, giving us the sense that he was a 'happy-go-lucky'.\n\nI've heard many praise the cinematography and camera work of the film and I can certainly see why. \nMy absolute favorite shot in the film is when Sanjuro brilliantly sets up the two gangs into fighting one another. The ronin sits up on the watchtower in absolute delight as he watches over the two cowardly gangs pathetic excuse to intimidate one another. \n\nAnyways, Yojimbo was spectacular. I'd like to start a sort of discussion/analysis here; what did you like/dislike about Yojimbo. What did Kurosawa display in this film that other films fail to capture? \n\n\n\n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/7rpo5i/colossal_2016_a_wonky_and_unsatisfying_film/",
        "text": "As a fan of movies that use the supernatural as a metaphor for the harsh realities of life (e.g. The Babadook, It Follows, Where the Wild things Are), I was interested to see Colossal, and felt (and still feel) that it had an interesting premise, one that could have been spun into a good, or even great, movie.\n\nBut the execution was completely botched, other than the solid acting from Anne Hathaway and Jason Sudeikis. Here are my issues with it:\n\n1) **The character of Joel**. Why was this guy in the film again? A cardboard character with no personality that doesn't even deserve the title of 'plot device' because he literally has no role in the plot. He hangs around with the main characters, makes himself useful as a driver or a camera operator at points, and then after a brief moment of flirting earlier on, has a scene where he sleeps with Gloria. This scene, like his character, serves no narrative purpose whatsoever, unless there's something I'm missing. During the scene where Gloria and Joel leave in the morning to desperately stop Oscar from drunkenly entering the playground, I thought I saw where the plot was heading - I thought Oscar noticing Joel and Gloria had spent the night together would fuel his envy and make him angry, leading to some other plot event - but this never happened, and the event was immediately forgotten. It's also utterly bizarre to me that Joel tends to just watch Gloria and Oscar fight and doesn't try to help (or even say anything) as this is going on. What exactly is Joel's relation to *anyone*?\n\n2) **Weird or opaque character motivations**. It's hinted through some of the dialogue that Oscar really envies Gloria because he's a barkeeper and she is a successful and talented online journalist or something (*apparently* - stupidly we are only told about this and not shown, so it's never very easy to believe). His resentment doesn't make much sense to me, and more of a sexual motive would actually have made me believe in his character a little more, but strangely, despite a few flirty lines early on, he doesn't seem to have much sexual feeling towards Gloria. \n\n3) **The ending**. The ending defeats the point of the extended metaphor of the film. I mean, the film seems to be about (among other things) abusive relationships and how people can exploit others when they have power over them, and how this destructive behaviour ripples out and affects others. Fine. So when Gloria murders Oscar by slingshotting him, what are we meant to take from this moment, in terms of the metaphor? Murder is the solution? If someone is abusing you, kill them? Plus, straight-up murder really didn't seem like Gloria's character, especially when sober, and it was equally odd that we saw a brief shot of Joel watching what was going on TV and smiling approvingly. What the hell, Joel? You just watched your friend die! \n\n4) **Dreadful acting from the guy who played Tim**. The acting isn't bad in the film, but Tim is horrible. Someone seems to have told the actor that he's playing \"exasperated man\" in this movie, and his exasperation is irritatingly unconvincing throughout. The tone of voice and the constantly flailing arms just don't work, and it exposes how bad some of the script is (after the firework scene, calling Oscar a \"silly person\" was probably the worst line - I had no idea what they were going for with that. Was it comic relief?).\n\n5) **Flat cinematography, dull and obvious soundtrack, uninteresting mise-en-scene**. There's nothing that's really very visually memorable in this film. I think the only shot I felt somewhat impressed by was when Gloria wakes up and, due to the massive TV filling the background, it's almost as if she's looking on at a ruined Seoul. A clever shot, and more like that needed.\n\nAlso - and these are more minor quibbles:\n\n6) Flashback scene 'explaining' how Gloria and Oscar came to become their action figures. No need for this at all - if you're making a metaphor, commit to the metaphor, don't try and explain it.\n\n7) The idea that (drunk) Gloria is remotely capable of figuring out, from news footage and a map of Seoul on her wall, the exact parameters of the playground when she barely seems mentally capable of blowing up an air mattress.\n\n\nThoughts? Am I missing anything?",

Also, ending has stuck with me for a while now.\n\nConnie is arrested, he clears Nick of any charges, and Nick's grandmother puts him back into the development program, where he finally starts to participate. \n\nA lot of people who I've talked about the ending with thought that it was sad, others thought it was bittersweet. What I think is that someone's feeling about the ending will depend on whether they have confidence that the program will help Nick. Most people who thought it was sad thought that Nick was being thrust into a program that undermined his personality and emotions, others thought that he finally had a chance for help.\n\nI fall towards bittersweet. Growing up, autism affected a lot of family members and learning disability programs became something that I was very familiar with. I have seen it help some of my family, I have also seen some of them fall into deep depressions, not being able to be themselves. To me, whether developmental training will help someone or not comes completely down to the person.\n\nI think Nick participating in the activity showed that he was working towards improving himself. I don't think it would matter if he ended up quitting the group or not. By walking across the room, it showed that he was finally making an effort in his life, rather than Connie never letting him branch out. It doesn't matter if the program doesn't help, it matters that Nick is finally helping himself.\n\nI thought this was positive, and Connie also found his purpose that he was searching for the entire movie.\n\nOr I'm just a big ol dummy",

        "text": "Video Form: https://youtu.be/tJdxmthi88E\n\nTo say that sequels are destined to be worse than the original doesn’t seem to be a fair statement, but it happens more often than not. For every Empire Strikes Back and Godfather Part 2, there are a dozen Speed 2: Cruise Controls. However, once every blue moon there comes a film, so good, so powerful that may just be at the same level or even above the original. This is The Dark Knight, Aliens, T2 and now Blade Runner 2049. Watching it reminds us why we watch movies. It takes you places, it immerses you in its atmosphere and when it’s all said and done it feels as if we’ve undergone some sort of profound experience. To expand on a story, especially a film with a solid following such as Blade Runner is no easy task. It’s definitely the road less traveled for a reason. But Denis Villeneuve and his team achieved this, as Blade Runner 2049 successfully expands on every single theme and character from the original. The same questions and ideas appear in our minds: The Struggle with one’s own humanity. What makes us human?\n\n“You’re special”. Depending on the movie, the protagonist’s arc is one of the most important aspects in a story, if not the most important. K is a replicant from the get go, at least as far as he knows. The other cops in the Police Department don’t like him, he struggles with his identity and tries to find out who he really is. Isn’t that what we’re all looking for? He’s the character that’s down on his luck and is faced with an unexpected situation that forces him to change. This makes him extremely relatable. Besides, he’s really good at his job and it’s like we’re solving a mystery alongside him. \n\nLet’s take a close look at the original Blade Runner, more specifically the Final Cut of the film. It didn’t do great at the box office, but developed a following over time. A lot of people regard Blade Runner as one of the best sci-fi movies ever made. However, there seems to be quite a bit of people that dislike the movie or find it merely OK. The vast majority of the people that don’t like it, say that that the movie is either too slow or too boring. Most can’t tell the difference between the two, but it’s important to differentiate. Slow is not necessarily bad, and both Blade Runner movies benefit from this. It builds up the atmosphere and lets it sink in. Boring, however, means uneventful. It means that whatever was supposed to happen either didn’t or wasn’t executed properly. Blade Runner 2049 is slow, but never boring. The original, however, well there is an argument to be had here. Blade Runner is a movie that undeniably thrives because of its beautiful set design and atmosphere. 2019 Los Angeles  has and always will feel like a real, breathing place. It’s beautiful film noir. However, there’s no real mystery in Blade Runner, so it’s a movie where you kind of just have to enjoy the imagery and the atmosphere. Deckard in the original film isn’t really a particularly likeable or even interesting character if you take away the dream sequence. The movie’s focus is in the wrong place, because the interesting character is Roy Batty, as he’s the one with the interesting arc.\n\nDeckard starts out and ends the movie as pretty much the same person or replicant. Is he a replicant? Ridley Scott says he is and it’s great that in 2049 they just brush over it because it’s not important to this story. Which brings us to why Blade Runner 2049 is the greatest sequel ever made. Besides thoroughly expanding on themes, characters and even going as far as topping the cinematography, set designs and score of the original, Blade Runner 2049 focuses on what it has to. It’s not concerned with setting up for a sequel or even answering questions from the original because it’s not relevant to this story. It didn’t feel like a compromised studio movie. It takes everything that worked in the original and expands upon it and discards the things that didn’t work. Blade Runner 2049 is the greatest sequel ever made because it was made by a filmmaker with a vision that clearly loves the original and had a unique story to tell. And so was Godfather Part 2 and Empire and T2, Aliens, Fury Road, Toy Story 2, The Two Towers. They are all the greatest sequel of all time. There is no one best sequel ever made. The only thing there is, is benchmarks and prime examples for new filmmakers to follow. Blade Runner 2049 is one of those examples.\n\nVideo Form: https://youtu.be/tJdxmthi88E\n",

        "text": "I know I'm in the minority here, but I really, really, really, disliked Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, Missouri.\n\nHere is my full review and analysis of what I think it's a bad film:\nhttp://www.shrinktank.com/hated-three-billboards-outside-of-ebbing-missouri/ \n\n\n\nBelow is a condensed version of my review:\nI'm curious if others had the similar issues with the film.\n  \nThe Whole is Lesser Than the Sum of its Parts\nDespite my strong contempt for this film, the majority of the cast pour their heart and soul into the material that they are given.  McDormand, one of the greatest actresses of all-time, buries herself in the role of Mildred Hayes. McDormand gets a few brief moments to showcase her versatility.  She is an actress who will go any lengths to immerse herself in character.  She shows no vanity in an industry that is soaking in self-congratulatory vanity.\n \nHarrelson and Rockwell both shine in drawing out nuance and complexity in their roles.  I think the ease that they are able to take McDonagh’s etch-a-sketch characterization and flesh them out comes from (a) having previously worked with the writer-director, and (b) McDonagh’s affection for their characters.  Willoughby and Dixon are proof that McDonagh not only fancies their characters more than Mildred Hayes, but that McDonagh is better at writing male characters than getting into the internal psyche of women.\n \n\nWhy is ‘Three Billboards’ a “Bad” Movie?\n \n1. IT DOESN’T WORK AS A DARK COMEDY/DRAMA.\nWhat makes ‘Three Billboards’ such an epic misfire?  Well for starters, it is either a grossly unfunny dark comedy, or a drama that undercuts its subject matter with misplaced attempts at humor.  The tone and execution of this film is its biggest offense.  The majority of humor is not only unfunny, it is cringingly unfunny.  Part of the offense goes to the writing and part of the blame goes to editing.  Jon Gregory is listed as the film’s editor.  I don’t think he’s mastered the importance of timing, pauses, and space necessary to have humor effectively land in dramatic films.  It can be done.  The Coen Brothers and Tarantino have consistently infused humor and levity to counter moments of terror, threat, and violence.  McDonagh and Gregory’s use of humor and levity undercuts the serious stakes at play in ‘Three Billboards.’\n \nOne scene, in particular, encapsulates my problems with the film.  \n \nCharlie, Mildred’s ex-husband, pays her and their son Robbie a visit.  Charlies is played by the criminally underused John Hawkes. It has been implied that Charlie beat Mildred while they were married, and his entrance stokes the tension and threat of violence.  Things quickly escalate between the two and Charlie suddenly throws the kitchen table, strangles Mildred by the neck, and only yields when their son Robbie (Hedges) holds a kitchen knife against his dad’s throat. \n   \nThe confrontation is diffused by Charlie’s 19-year-old girlfriend entering the home and awkwardly babbling about needing to use the bathroom.  Her dialogue and character are intended for comic relief, but her character belongs in a different movie.  Immediately, Mildred, Charlie, and Robbie pick up the knocked over furniture and resume their conversation like nothing happened. The tension is this scene was palpable.  \n \nThe comic relief was forced, and the entire scene felt disingenuous and was sabotaged.\n \nThe violence in the film is horrific and undercuts any claims that the film is a dark or black comedy.  When I’ve watch Tarantino or Coen Brother dark comedies, the out-of-place violence provoke bemusement and amusement.  Deaths or acts of violence often follow with, “did that just really happen?” or a sense of shock and guilt for laughing at the scene.\n \nThere is one particular scene where I think McDonagh and Gregory successfully switch tones.  Mildred Hayes is at the police station being interviewed (interrogated?) by Chief Willoughby.  The banter between the two is biting and playful, elusive and ambiguous.  The tension between the two continues to build when suddenly Willoughby coughs blood that splatters on Mildred’s face.  They both freeze in shock and disbelief.\n \nWilloughby is apologetic and scared.  Mildred is concerned and compassionate.  The tone suddenly shifts from humor and anger to worry and care.  It is the best scene in the entire film.  Perhaps McDonagh is better at framing a scene that switches from humor to pathos than going from tension to comedy.\n \n2. THE PROFANITY FELT FORCED AND WAS DISTRACTING.\nMcDonagh’s writing style just doesn’t click with me.  There is something about how he employs profanity that I find grating and disingenuous.  I’m not against the use of profanity if it fits the characters and the world they inhabit.  I think that is why despite my repulsion of the N-word, the characters in Tarantino films speak in a manner that is consistent with the world he has created.\n \nMcDonagh’s use of profanity, in contrast, is cheap, mostly for shock value, and either betrays the characters or tells us nothing about them.  And if Tarantino is in love with the n-word, then McDonagh gets off on overusing the two c-words, “c*nt and c*ck!”\n \n3. THE FILM CANNOT DECIDE WHO IS THE CENTRAL CHARACTER.\n \nMildred Hayes still an enigma to the audience by the end of the film, because the film and its filmmaker show little interest in digging deeper into the pain, guilt, and damage of her character.  She merely functions as the first domino that orchestrates the chain reaction of events in the town and townspeople. And because Mildred is not given any arc for growth or insight, the only change that has occurred in her is fatigue. She’s weary. \n \nContrast the limited character advancement that Mildred undergoes with the arc and focus that McDonagh pays to Woody Harrelson’s Chief Willoughby or Sam Rockwell’s Officer Dixon.  Willoughby dominates the second act and Dixon dominates the third act.  And each exploration is at the expense of exploring Mildred Hayes.  \n \nThe film is sold as a mother’s vigilante pursuit of justice. It is headlined by Francis McDormand. Yet the film and its filmmaker seem more interested in the white, male characters. It is a tone-deaf mistake.  It is either (1) an egregious error of marketing, or (2) a manipulative move in order to convey that the film is #woke despite its fixation of the white men.  The women in ‘Three Billboards’ are not given as much time, depth, complexity, or conflict as their male counterpoints.\n \n4. THE RACIAL POLITICS OF THE FILM ARE DISTURBING BY THE UTTER LACK OF ATTENTION.\nOne of the biggest criticisms leveled at ‘Three Billboards’ is the so-called “redemption” of Officer Dixon.  For the first two-thirds of the film, Dixon is depicted as one of if not the primary antagonist in the story.  He has a reputation for being racist and abusive toward others.  In one of the film’s most horrific scenes, Dixon is shown brutally attacking Red Welby (Caleb Landry Jone), the salesman who rents the billboards out to Mildred Hayes.  It is a gruesome scene shot in one long, uninterrupted shot.  \n \nIt is also the only scene where we truly get a glimpse of what Dixon is capable of and how he’s probably earned his reputation in the town. Dixon returns to the police station after being fired to collect his things and reads a letter Willoughby wrote him urging Dixon to resist anger and favor love.  And then Mildred firebombs the police station and Dixon suffers severe burns to his face and body.\n \nHe finds himself in the same hospital room as Red Welby, the salesman he assaulted and severely injured.  Dixon apologizes, Welby indicates a degree of forgiveness, and soon Dixon shifts to the key protagonist in the third act of the film.  \n \nNow, I’m not sure how much Dixon finds redemption in the film, but the pivot the film makes to focus on his journey in the third act is just one more example of how tone-deaf McDonagh is.  Did he not realize how problematic people would find Dixon’s storyline, especially after the first two-thirds of the film is building up how despicable of a person he is?  And then to have the film demonstrate so much care, sensitivity, and empathy for him without addressing the racist reputation he carries is dismissive and insensitive to the audience.  \n\n5. ‘THREE BILLBOARDS OUTSIDE OF EBBING, MISSOURI’S’ MORAL COMPASS IS “INJUSTICE FOR ALL.”\nWhat’s the point of the film?  What’s the central message or endgame for McDonagh?  For me, the film’s arc is to showcase “Injustice for All.”  Everybody in the film suffers.  Those who commit crimes get away with it.  Those who are decent still suffer due to injustice, and life goes on.\n \nMildred Haye’s daughter was brutally raped, murdered, and burned.  Her killer or killers are still at-large.  Charlie was a notorious wife-beater.  He even assaults Mildred in the film, long after their divorce.  Nothing happens to him.  He gets away with it.  Mildred’s friend and coworker played by Amanda Warren is arrested, and nothing happens. Officer Dixon has allegedly beaten people of color and the audience witnesses him relentlessly attack Red Welby.  He gets away with it.  \n \nYes, he loses his job as a police officer, but he doesn’t get arrested or put in jail, or face any legal consequences for his actions.  Charlie, Mildred’s ex-husband burns down the billboards.  Nothing happens to him.  Mildred herself assaults two teenagers at the local high school.  She gets away with it.  Then Mildred firebombs the police station and badly injures Office Dixon.  Nothing happens to her.  She gets away with it.\n \nSo a movie that burns with anger about injustice spends two hours showcasing all the characters getting away with every crime they commit.  I’m not sure if there is a creative message buried beneath the surface, but if there is, I missed the point.\n\nFor the entire review - check out:\nhttp://www.shrinktank.com/hated-three-billboards-outside-of-ebbing-missouri/ ",

        "text": "Greatly influenced by the films of Jean Renoir and italian neorealism, in 1955 [Satyajit Ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyajit_Ray) filmed *Pather Panchali*.\n\n\n&gt;In Nischindipur, rural Bengal, in the 1910s, Harihar Roy (Kanu Banerjee) earns a meagre living as a pujari (priest), but dreams of a better career as a poet and playwright. His wife Sarbajaya (Karuna Banerjee) takes care of their children, Durga (Uma Dasgupta) and Apu (Subir Banerjee), and Harihar's elderly cousin, Indir Thakrun (Chunibala Devi). Because of their limited resources, Sarbajaya resents having to share her home with the old and helpless cripple Indir. At times, Sarbajaya's taunts become offensive, forcing Indir to take temporary refuge in the home of another relative. Durga is fond of Indir and often gives her fruit she has stolen from a wealthy neighbour's orchard. One day, the neighbour's wife accuses Durga of stealing a bead necklace (which Durga denies) and blames Sarbajaya for encouraging her tendency to steal.\n\n\n&gt;As the elder sibling, Durga cares for Apu with motherly affection, but spares no opportunity to tease him. Together, they share the simple joys of life: sitting quietly under a tree, viewing pictures in a travelling vendor's bioscope, running after the candy man who passes through the village, and watching a jatra (folk theatre) performed by a troupe of actors. Every evening they are delighted by the sound of a distant train's whistle. One day, they run away from home to catch a glimpse of the train, only to discover Indir lying dead on their return.\n\n\n&gt;Unable to earn a good living in the village, Harihar travels to the city to seek a better job. He promises Sarbajaya that he will return with money to repair their dilapidated house. During his absence, the family sinks deeper into poverty. Sarbajaya grows increasingly lonely and bitter. One day during the monsoon season, Durga plays in the downpour for too long, catches a cold and develops a high fever. Adequate medical care being unavailable, the fever becomes worse, and on a night of incessant rain and gusty winds, she dies. Harihar returns home and starts to show Sarbajaya the merchandise he has brought from the city. Sarbajaya, who remains silent, breaks down at the feet of her husband, and Harihar cries out in grief as he discovers that he has lost his daughter. The family decide to leave their ancestral home. As they start packing, Apu finds the necklace that Durga had earlier denied stealing; he throws it into a pond. Apu and his parents leave the village on an ox-cart.\n\nThe film was very well received both in India and abroad and turned out to be the foremost example of [Parallel Cinema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_cinema):\n\n&gt;Inspired by Italian Neorealism, Parallel Cinema began just before the French New Wave and Japanese New Wave, and was a precursor to the Indian New Wave of the 1960s. The movement was initially led by Bengali cinema and produced internationally acclaimed filmmakers such as Satyajit Ray, Mrinal Sen, Ritwik Ghatak, Tapan Sinha and others. It later gained prominence in other film industries of India and Bangladesh\n\n\n\n\nI saw the film yesterday. It's an indian rural drama that deals with extreme poverty and the problems of a countryside family in Bengal. It does so it in such an compassionate way that is difficult for tme not to relate to the protagonists. In spite that the story and the setting is very different, the modest \"plot\" an the unassuming tone and approach puts this movie in direct relation with italian or japanese  neorealist cinema.\n\n\nI knew it was a realist drama set in India and it came across precisely as that, but is one thing to say it an another to experience the actual movie. It was a heartwarming experience; it brought me back to that feeling I experienced the first time I saw Ozu or De Sica movies for example.\n\nIf you are interested in (neo)realist cinema I highly recommend this movie.\n\n\nIt has two sequels that follow the life of the protagonist, Apu: [The Apu Trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Apu_Trilogy).\n\n\n*Quotes are from the [Wikipedia Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pather_Panchali#Influences)",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/7rfauo/xpost_from_rmovies_a_response_to_i_belong_where/",
        "text": "[Here is the article in question.](https://www.tor.com/2018/01/16/i-belong-where-the-people-are-disability-and-the-shape-of-water/comment-page-1/)\n\n────────\n\nThis is actually a great article addressing honest concerns and emotions about the film while still never berating those who never saw such a problematic narrative in the film. I honestly feel bad for her, given how it made her feel.\n\nBut as some of the comments say, I can't help but feel perceiving the creature as anything less than a person is ignoring the message of the film. It's not that the film sees Elisa as less than human, it's that she sees herself that way. Strickland sees her that way. A lot of the world sees the trio of protagonists as lesser than.\n\nShe meets the asset (a dehumanizing title for the creature; Elisa calls him a him whereas most other people call him an it) and she finally falls in love with someone who doesn't give a shit about her disability. She simply is. She is her best qualities, her love of music and life and her exuberance, her innocence, her warmth. She isn't her disability. She's Elisa. And he's in love with her on a primal elemental level.\n\nStrickland sees both the creature and Elisa as being less than human. His worldview is that we're made in \"the Lord's image\" and that one such as him, free of physical disability, is closer to God than one like Elisa. When in truth, it is Elisa that's worthy of the asset's love, the God's love, and in a less direct sense, Giles as well. It's the content of our hearts and who we are that make us worth loving. To see the creature as lesser than disregards the message that humanness is more than physical conditions. Strickland may be humanized but he's still the film's greatest monster. He gets off on the silence of women he can take advantage of, he's merciless and limited in his perspective. Nobody is a total monster in every facet of their lives. But he is ultimately percieved as a pitiful figure. A squirming specimen, lower than the creature not because he's disabled in body but in soul. He is filled with hate, living the lie of the American dream, a dream that disregards the marginalized. The creature is true to himself. Strickland's food of choice is hard candy. Completely and totally artificial. The creature? Eggs. Life. There are no false appearances to the creature. What you see is what you get. Accept it or don't because it is something you cannot change.\n\nI understand how the dance scene may come off even more problematic but keeping in mind what she sings (\"You'll never know how much I love you...\"), I think it's less \"I wish I could sing\" or \"I wish I wasn't broken\" but rather \"I wish I could tell you how much you mean to me.\" Those of us who have found love, true love, will know how difficult it is to properly express how far our love goes. In this case, a case where her beloved speaks neither English nor ASL, it only becomes harder to express that love, that passion. And so the creature quietly eats his egg, unaware of how much he means to Elisa. That alienation manifests in fantasy; the fantasy of communion through song and through dance.\n\nI can only speak from an able-bodied perspective, though. My afflictions are mental, depression and ADD. I can't relate to the physical elements of disability. I can however relate to feeling less than a person.\n\nI will end on this note, however; there is a person in my life who is willing to love me regardless of such afflictions. He supports me in pushing against my depression. My family as well of course, but I speak in romantic terms when I say he doesn't see how I am incomplete. He sees me as I am.",

So I was thinking about the movies Breathless (1960) and Chungking Express (1994), and for some reason I got quite hooked on the idea that I had to find a third movie which was similar to the two others... Even though these two movies could be said to be quite different, I for some reason feel they are quite similar with regards to their \"young\" feel, the loose narrative structure, the romantic and urban themes, the great attention to style and just the general \"charmingness\". I do realize that this may seem somewhat confused, but if some of you for some reason understand what I mean by that these two films feel similar, I would very much like some recommendations for another great movie that also feels similar, as I have gotten the Idea stuck in my head that I must have a trilogy of these young and \"jazzy\" films...",
