AFAIK the Italian president like many parliamentary democracies is meant to be politically neutral and only act to protect the Constitution.\n\nSecondary question is, even if what has been done is technically ok, is using this power going against the concepts involved in a functional parliamentary system with resulting consequences.\n\nLink to BBC story\n\nhttp://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44275010",

        "text": "# Topic\n\nIn the past few days, the Trump administration has [reportedly](https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-abortion/trump-takes-aim-at-planned-parenthood-in-proposed-abortion-regulation-idUSL2N1SP0YK) moved forward on a plan to cut federal funding from any reproductive health provider for \"[so much as telling \\[a woman\\] where she could go get \\[an abortion\\]](https://www.yahoo.com/news/apos-apos-domestic-gag-rule-180424235.html)\".\n\n# Clarification\n\nWhite House spokesperson, Sarah Sanders, says that the policy \"[would ensure that taxpayers do not indirectly fund abortions](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-trump-family-planning-rule-abortion-20180517-story,amp.html)\". However, [the Hyde Amendment already prohibits the use of Title X federal funding for abortions—except to save the life of the pregnant woman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyde_Amendment).\n\nSome claim that the new proposed policy \"[could mean that a clinic can't even receive Title X funding for the other important health services they provide \\(like providing access to affordable birth control methods that would prevent unwanted pregnancies\\) if they also offer abortions or answer their patient's questions about abortion referrals.](https://www.yahoo.com/news/apos-apos-domestic-gag-rule-180424235.html)\"\n\nSo some have inferred that \"[Under this type of policy, health centers would have to either stop providing abortions and giving out any information about where to access a safe abortion or no longer receive the federal funding that allows them to care for a wide range of patients.](https://www.yahoo.com/news/apos-apos-domestic-gag-rule-180424235.html)\"\n\n[Some have labeled the proposal a \"gag rule\"](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-targets-planned-parenthood-family-planning-services-new-abortion-rule-n875276) because they worry that it will prevent reproductive health professionals from even discussing abortion. The White House [disputes that description and the worries that motivate it](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-trump-family-planning-rule-abortion-20180517-story.html). \\(I'm not interested in endorsing or criticizing that description. I mention it only in case adding it to your search queries yields more relevant results—there are lots of regulations on reproductive health clinics besides this new proposed regulation.\\)\n\n# Explanation?\n\nMany [think that the proposal is timed to remind social conservatives to vote for Republican lawmakers in the 2018 midterm elections](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-trump-rallies-abortion-opponents-20180522-story,amp.html).\n\n# Questions\n\n1. **Further clarification.** Are any of the claims summarized herein bogus? Are any merely misleading?\n2. **Reproductive Health.** Politics aside, what does the best evidence suggest? Does reproductive health tend to be lower/higher when such policies are in place than when they are not \\(controlling for casually relevant variables\\)? Is there no preponderance of evidence either way?\n3. **Politics.** How does this policy play, politically, given that [the majority of voters think abortion should be legal, a minority of voters think that abortion is morally wrong](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/01/26/5-facts-about-abortion/), and multiple self\\-professed socially conservative Republicans have had affairs that reportedly involved abortions.\\[[1](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-lawyer-negotiated-16-million-settlement-for-gop-donor-with-playboy-model/2018/04/13/2f051f90-3f3e-11e8-974f-aacd97698cef_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.1e65bdb8bc48)\\] \\[[2](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/05/gop-rep-tim-murphy-resigns-after-reports-asked-mistress-to-get-abortion.html)\\]\n4. **Logistics**. How enforceable are policies that restrict what healthcare providers can discuss with patients?\n5. What other questions are pertinent?",

        "text": "A few weeks ago, there was a little flurry of press attention over a bill by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand ([D-NY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirsten_Gillibrand)) to allow the Post Office to take deposits and make payday loans. For example, per [this Slate article](https://slate.com/business/2018/04/kirsten-gillibrands-ambitious-postal-banking-bill.html):\n\n&gt;The potential 2020 contender is rolling out legislation today that would require post offices to offer their customers basic financial services, such as checking and savings accounts and small, short-term loans, that many Americans currently can’t access affordably. \n\nA lot of outlets covered her plan to submit a bill ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/25/senator-gillibrand-wants-the-u-s-postal-service-to-offer-retail-banking.html); [The Hill](http://thehill.com/policy/finance/384837-gillibrand-bill-would-open-banking-services-at-post-offices); [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2018/04/26/local-post-office-becomes-bank-if-bill-passes/553207002/)). [Gillibrand tweeted](https://www.americanbanker.com/news/gillibrand-aims-to-wipe-out-payday-lenders-with-postal-banking-bill) that the purpose of the bill was to \"wipe out\" payday lenders.\n\nAll of these articles were light on details, because the actual bill [hadn't been published by the GPO yet](https://www.theepochtimes.com/new-york-senator-kirsten-gillibrand-introduces-legislation-to-turn-post-offices-into-banks_2506435.html). \n\nWhen the [bill was finally published,](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/2755/text) the details were......interesting. Here are some of the key provisions, which would be appended to 39 USC 404(a)\n\n- Per new subparagraph (10)(B), the USPS could take deposits for savings accounts, and would have to pay interest at least equal to the nonjumbo savings rate. That rate is [currently 0.07%.](https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/resources/rates/)\n\n- Per new subparagraph (10)(C), the USPS could make \"small dollar loans\" with an interest rate no greater than the 101% of the 1 month Treasury [constant maturity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/constantmaturity.asp) rate.^1 That is [currently 1.7%](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS1MO); at 101%, the cap on rates that the USPS could charge is 1.717%.\n\nTwo observations, each with a question:\n\n- As a general matter, [interest rates reflect the risk that the borrower will default.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/bonds/09/bond-market-interest-rates.asp) As that link notes, US Treasury rates are so low - and considered the risk-free rate - because of the unlikelihood that the US will default on its debt. By contrast, payday loans typically have [very high default rates](http://thehill.com/regulation/237538-borrowers-default-on-nearly-half-of-all-payday-loans-in-2-years-study-finds) and have commensurately [high interest rates.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2014/04/20/id-nv-ut-have-among-highest-payday-loan-rates/7943519/) By allowing borrowers to use the interest rates applicable to the US, is this a subsidy to payday borrowers?\n\n- Note that the bill would require that the rate, *inclusive of fees*, be no more than the 1-month treasury rate. Let's take a slightly-simplified example: say I want to borrow $100 from the USPS, to be repaid in a month. The maximum APR is 1.717%, so the maximum I could be charged for a one-year loan is $1.72. For a one-month loan, that would mean that the interest and fees I could be charged could not exceed 14 cents. If the median hourly pay rate for a USPS clerk - excluding the cost of benefits - is [$23.91](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes435051.htm), and we use standard [cost allocation accounting](https://www.accountingtools.com/articles/what-is-cost-allocation.html), that would mean that my interest rate would be 0% and the post office employee could spend no more than 21 seconds processing my loan, otherwise they'd be losing money. They could charge me 14 cents as a processing fee, but no more; as a result, there would be no interest rate cushion to absorb losses, and a default rate of more than zero percent would mean the USPS would lose money. Is this a feasible business line for the USPS? If not, what could the USPS do to make this a feasible business line? How could the bill be changed to make it feasible for the USPS to engage in payday lending?\n\n^1 As that Investopedia article explains, the constant maturity rate is the average yield on debt of all different maturities coming due at the same time. In theory, a five year bond coming due in one year should have the same risk profile as a one-year bond issued today. Both have the exact same risks, since both mature on the exact same day. ",
