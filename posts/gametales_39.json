        "text": "So I thought I would share my experience of one of my first tabletop experiences as it was possibly the best campaign i've ever been a part of. \nNow im going to apologise here as i'm still new to role playing so I had my hand held through a lot of the game in terms of mechanics but im simply gonna tell you about the fun game stuff...so aaaanyway lets go.\n\nSo its a Dark Heresy game and the DM Mark tells everyone to go off and create a character and the usual stuff and i set off onto my fluff and decide to create a Guardsman who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and an Inquisitor has decided that he needs the rather average and slightly bewildered man in his retinue. Now for some reason i decided to write into Silas's fluff that he knew how to pilot a Sentinel, it just seemed right at the time...more on this later.\nNow Mark had been running the campaign for a few weeks and Silas was actually a replacement for another player so he does the cog stuff and gets me up to a slightly lower but similar level as the team.\nHe wanted me to be the new guy.\nNow this group consisted of a Tech Priest with a terrible sense of timing, a sister of battle and a veteran of many battle Thaddeus who unfortunately for Silas took the young Guardsman under his wing for \"specialist training\".\n\nNow jump forward a session or two of sneaking into cults, shooting at stuff missing and tripping over a step and falling down a flight of stairs our team finds itself in a manufactorum and split into two teams the Tech Priest and the Sister are interrogating a man about a cult who were attempting to bind daemons to the machine spirits of vehicles while Thaddeus and Silas were about to bust up a meeting between some important cultists.\nIn short they alert the entire sector which causes cultists the swarm from the woodwork. Now Thaddeus and Silas were both able to hold their own but the DM wanted us to move now and this became apparent when the daemon vehicles turned up. \nFleeing now the pair who couldnt get hold of the interrogators barricaded themselves into a room which our DM claimed held an inert Imperial Knight titan, so thinking for a moment Silas and Thaddeus discuss using the machines battle cannon manually to take as many of the cultists out as possible in an epic last stand.\nOut of character though I notice Mark is staring at me and says \"Are you REALLY sure thats all you can do\" I knew he was trying to make it fun for me and the rest of the group and thats when I decide its Silas's time to shine as i look to Thaddeus's player and say.\n\"Im going to pilot it\" \nMark had read my fluff and anticipating this had prepared a Knight in his story for some limited time Daemon engine arse kicking.\nI roll to mount the hull - pass\nI roll knowledge of piloting a walker - pass\n\nSo after a few moments the doors are bust down and out strides an Imperial night titan with an aging solider hanging from the hull shouting obscenities at the gathered cultists as we proceed to demolish half of the structure we are in.\n\nBest. Session. Ever. :D ",

        "text": "The massacre did not last long. My party dealt with the fodder while the drow and I headed straight for the elf/kua-toa. I noticed the drow was wearing Windum's robes. I had no chance to think on that matter but would be sure to question him later.\n\nAs we approached the elf-toa he glared at us, brandishing his jewel-encrusted sword. I grabbed him by the head and lifted him from the ground. In shock, he dropped the sword. The drow quickly picked it up and drove the blade through his back while I popped his head like a wrinkly-green cherry.\n\nThe party had almost finished the gangsters and the rat was engaged with the giant beast. I quickly ending that battle, and the rat returned to his small size and up the drows sleeve.\n\nI asked why he was wearing the wizard's robes, and he replied that Windum had given them to him as he no longer needed them. He stated they could be used to control the rat. Well, control isn't the best term. The robes allowed him to communicate with the rat and ask him to do things. He explained the rat had free will of his own, but would help when his goals and ours were the same.\n\nWhen pressed for more details, the drow claimed he had no more. I knew he was hiding something but I let it slide.\n\nThe drow wiped the blood clean from the jeweled blade and sheathed it as it's new owner. He stated he did not intend to keep this item as the party argued over who should have it. The drow eventually held everyone off by stating if anyone wanted it, they could come try and take it.\n\nTough talk from a skinny creature such as himself, but Akma needs no weapon, so he can have his delusion. \n\nBack in town, news of the gangs defeat had already spred. Much if the town was thankful to be rid of these scum, and many were actually beginning the support and cheer for the “Calamity” as they called us. The guards were not as pleased. They seemed to still treat us as unwelcome. It really didn't matter. In the end, they would be serving me anyway. But lets not get ahead.\n\nThe drow quickly found a fence for his less-than-legal weapon he had acquired. The shady merchant was an aquatic elf who looked familiar. But it couldn't be the same one from the arena could it? After all, he was looking pretty dead after we were done with him and his crew. They really look the same anyway.\n\nThe elf merchant quickly offered the drow 1000 gold coins for the sword, to which the drow immediately agreed. The transaction was finished, and the elf quickly made off with the drow smirking and counting his coins. I still do not understand the value of these coins, but on this plane they seem to be a currency.\n\nBack at the tavern, the group was talking and celebrating. I sat and watched the room, oberserving, looking for exploits or trouble. The night was a bit slow, but I was okay with that.\n\nThe drow was eventually approached by a gnome who introduced himself as another merchant. He stated he had witnessed the transaction that had occurred between the drow and the aquatic elf.\n\n“How much did he offer for that valuable item?” The gnome asked.\n\nThe drow smirked, “1000 gold, for a worthless sword covered in worthless jewels...jewels you can find on the ground outside!” he stated, pointing toward the door.\n\nThe gnome's eyes widened. “Worthless sword you say? My friend, I do not think you understand what was in your possession. I would have asked for quite a bit more if it were me.”\n\nThe drow's smirk faded, “How much should I have asked for?”\n\n“Well, what do you thing a kingdom is worth?” the gnome stated, almost jeeringly, “Because what you just sold to that very lucky elf, was the sword of the king.”",

I have taken the liberty to provide some horrible MSPaint visuals if those are liked I’ll do more of them if not I’ll get rid of them for part two, if theres any interest in this tale. However before I can tell you guys about the campaign I’m going tell you about the setting the campaign took place in.(Note the party knew none of the background of the world they were on as far as the players were concerned they were just on some land doing a task for some king)*\n\nLong, Long ago when the elves where still young, and the humans were still but a thought in the evolutionary process, when the dwarves had first started to mine, the land was ruled by beasts mightier than all others, dragons. These dragons constantly vied for power with each other gaining size, power, and magic as they continued their endless battles. When the dragons got too big for the land the adapted and gained the ability to land on water allowing them to get bigger still. Though as this breed of giant dragons fought each other more and more often they soon started dying out, being killed in battle before they had a chance to produce offsprings. Soon there were but two of these great dragons left.  One of silver who had scales underlain with diamonds, whose claws were made out of quartz, with molten gold for blood, bronze and iron skin, and an eye as green as emerald. A master of physical combat she had no equal however she had little magic of her own. The other dragon adorned in scales as hard and black as onyx, which had fire and magic in his veins knew no other who could match him in magic. They fought in a great struggle crashing against each other for many years till finally in one last burst of her power the dragon clad in silver ignited the magical network within the onyx beast disintegrating him completely. But not before he got one last swiped off burying a piece of claw inside an eye cursing her with his last breath that as long as that claw remained whole inside her eye she shall never awake again. [Weakened from the battle she was unable to resist the curse and came crashing down into the sea with her tail swiping a great canyon in the nearby landmass.](http://i.imgur.com/Z5Gav07.png)\n\nNow as this dragon laid there she slowly began to be enveloped by the sea and the land.  Sinking further and further and further as more and more land piled over top of her. [After many years the dragon was nothing more than a platform to hold the land that had risen over her. Her great spines became a range of mountain; the scars in her hide became rivers that flowed into scales torn away in her battle. The ancient humans on the landmass that the dragon crashed into started expanding onto this land](http://i.imgur.com/g8eHtOH.png). The oldest of them feared to traverse this land for they still knew that the land sat atop of a dragon. Their children and grandchildren did not heed their warnings and traversed onto this land travelling far for many years every generation forgetting more and more about how the land was formed till the tale of the great dragon who holds this land was nothing more than a fantasy. [They travelled far setting up a few villages in their path and finding diamonds in the soil further in. This is where they set up their first capital city.](http://i.imgur.com/ikM4gIP.png)  \n\n[Hundreds of years later they had explored the land in its entirety finding a great number of ores and gems around the land they referred to as Swaarfom. They set up 3 capital cities ;](http://i.imgur.com/6TqeJ2f.png) the largest in west was the mighty city of Quaven. This city is ruled by The King Trugle or Trugle the Fat as he jokingly referred to himself. He is a kind king a little dimwitted and slightly overweight but always thought the best of the people. He had one major downside though; he is consumed by the luxuries that being a king afforded him. He is always looking for that next trinket to amuse him or bring him more wealth. The next capital city set up so long ago was the city of Mefre. This city despite being the most ancient city in Swaarfom was also the poorest. Their diamond mines had been all but used up and their coffers were running low if it wasn’t for donations given by the two other capitals it would’ve fallen into ruin ages ago. It is ruled by The Pauper King Drefce, he tries to rule the people the best he can but he might as well be one of them. They elect their king ever ten years based on who provided the most for the peasants in those ten years.  Drefce discovered a new pocket of diamond ore in the mine that provided the town with more earned wealth then they had seen in ages. Though that pocket of ores to has started to become depleted. Then finally we have the city of Navak. No part of this city sits atop the dragon though the founders of this city didn’t know it. It is a decent city nothing special about it. It makes most of its wealth through trade with the neighboring continent of Cagne and its capital city of Aganar. It is ruled by The Merchant King Louven. He is loved by the people due to the work of his ancestors in setting up the trade with Aganar so long ago, and he has given the people no reason to stop. He always makes sure the people are looked after hell he even takes a round of watch with the city guard, though it’s largely for show as he never goes anywhere truly dangerous.  It is in this city that we began the campaign.\n\n[The party is called before Louven and he tells them about a rumor that has been floating around about there being a lake of liquid emerald far off into the east. That is why he has assembled you the strongest citizens in his kingdom. He is commissioning that the party go forth and confirm that such a place even exists and to claim it for Navak.  Of course the party accepts this quest. Delighted the king gives them some weapons and armor, nothing fancy nothings is enchanted but it is good solid gear, along with gold and supplies to camp with and tells them that he hears there is an old lady in a small village to the south that might know more about The Emerald Lake and they should try talking to her. Now completely unknown to the party there are two more parties of adventures being formed at around the same time they are.  The Pauper King Drefce has gathered a ragtag group of peasants and had them equipped with pretty basic old worn gear and told them to find this emerald lake so that the town of Mefre may once again have riches.  Then there’s The King of Aganar who has heard the rumors of The Emerald Lake from merchants. He wants the lake to be under his command so that he may become the wealthiest man that ever lived. He has given his group of adventures enchanted gear and a ship to get them to Swaarfom. Now you may be wondering what about Quaven shouldn’t they be forming a group and since they are closest they should easily be able to get to this lake what with their money and power? Well you are right The King Trugle did hear the rumors and he did send out a rather large party consisting of 50 men however none of them ever returned. He then wanted to send out a party of 100 men however the peasants were having none of that, they didn’t want to throw their lives away to help their king satisfy his greed and rebelled](http://i.imgur.com/i4VBbR7.png).\n\nAnyway back to the party, the party started the journey south encountering nothing special except for a few bandits I threw at them so that the players could get use to their characters and get them back in the swing of things. When they eventually arrive at the village they ask around the village about the lady and get pointed to the small house where she lives. As they approach her house they saw a group of 8 people walking away from her house. As they see the party they hurry up with the leader whispering to the party “We did not do what you will see” they then quickly are out of view. Mystified the party heads inside the house. What they find inside was so disgusting and so horrifying they had to roll a fortitude save to keep from throwing up. Two failed and had to step outside to puke while the others barely kept themselves together. [Inside the old lady was dead, stabbed well over 100 times on every inch of her body. There is blood pooled and sprayed everywhere on the floor.  There also strangely enough appears to be strange brown marks floating above her body.](http://i.imgur.com/0VS6agt.png)\n\n*Well that seems to be a good place to end part 1.*\n",

        "text": "Well dear friends and new readers it's time for part 7 in the Belin series. As with the previous posts I'll link the last one and you can follow them until you find the 4th. I believe links to the first 3 are there. Please enjoy and keep letting me know what you guys think. I love to read the comments and inbox messages. You guys have been great and really encouraged me to post more and more. I hope you guys know I keep you in mind while we play. I want to continue doing things that impress. Anyway without further ado here is part 7. \n\nPart 6 - http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2v2n1x/dd_355e_mix_the_tale_of_belin_the_blacksmith/\n\nSo when we last our hero he had acquired a house and shop. Normally he would set up shop but first he plans on honoring his promise to the mayor. So the group goes around looking for more info on the drow that are raiding the elf villages. They eventually find a drow hexblade who tells them that he can lead them to the drow (Monk's new character.) Now the party starts on their way to find the drow raiding party. The new party member tells us that they are still in the elf village after killing all the villagers. He tells us that they are still celebrating their most recent slaughterfest. \n\nWe finally arrive at the village and there are a couple guards outside but they look pretty drunk. Looks like they partied too hard. The party discusses and decides to have the drow walk in. They figure that two really drunk guards might not notice anything out of place if he walks in. Thank god the plan works and he flips around and hits them both over the head and knocks them out. The rest of the party starts to make their way in. Of course they start looting the two downed drow. Belin never really takes part of the looting or searching. However he looks down at the drow and notices that they are wearing something on their face. Special goggles that let them be above ground with no penalty. (We are informed that these are subterranean drow and not used to the sun. Looks like something the dead smith bought them.) Instantly I hear the description and think these are a sunglasses/goggles mix. I then have a flashback to my time watching digimon as a kid and decide that any leader worth his salt always needs goggles. Belin picks up a pair and puts it on his head. (Similar to Ty or Davis from digimon) He walks ahead with the new drow. He's now smiling, a rare thing indeed. The halfling decides to follow last. Making sure to double check pockets. While doing that he starts to wake up the one without the goggles. Quickly he panics and decides that they still provide a threat. He then quietly slits both of the downed drow's throats. Knowing that the rest of the party wouldn't be fond of killing downed enemies, he keeps this to himself. \n\nWe start making our way through the town, killing many many drow on our way. Finally we encounter a captain. He provides a bit of a challenge but in the end he begs us to spare them. He tells us that he only did it because a hill giant wanted the village for himself and was tired of \"The snooty elves.\" He explained that they did it for money and because they didn't want a angry hill giant looking towards they're caves either. He told the party the location of the hill giants home and tried to use how helpful he'd been and his story to be released. Sadly his story or help didn't matter. Belin had seen too many corpses of children during the time the party spent in the village. He told the captain to pick himself up and to fight him 1 on 1. Promising that the party would leave the captain to escape if he could best Belin in combat. Poor drow.... he never stood a chance.... Sadly this wasn't Belin's best moment but he has a weakness for kids, due to all the bullying he got as a kid, and his barbarian/orc rage took over for a minute. After the very satisfying act of overkill the party looked a Belin with a little more fear in their eyes. The new drow was bewildered. The halfling then decided to inform him that Belin was always like this and to stay on his good side. The cleric chimed in with \"None of you have seen what I have. His good side is the best and safest place to be.\" I couldn't help but laugh a lot since the cleric was the only original party member character left. Pretty sure all the rest died by me instead of monsters lol. \n\nSo now the party heads towards the hill giants home to ambush him. Unfortunately he'd heard all the commotion and was prepared for the party. Then something happened no one was ready for. We get to the entrance of his home and there is a big long path to an opening. He's standing in the opening smiling. Belin and our dragonborn fighter were not pleased by his smile. The whole party runs towards him and he slaps a button. The floor falls out and we all fall on small spikes. Everyone is taking damage and Belin starts climbing out. Sadly he fails a roll and falls. The hill giant is dying laughing. Belin is getting super pissed. At this point he realizes he's doing things wrong and starts throwing party members out of the pit. They get up and attack the giant and then the giant just pushes them back into the pit. They land on Belin... he's super mad now. He grabs the dragonborn and tells him to run around the giant and get on the other side. Throws him and the dragonborn snags the aggro off of the rest. Now they can climb out and get tossed. Belin finally gets out and in a anger fueled rage cuts off the giant's arm. He wails in pain and drops the large sized greatclub he's using. Next turn Belin grabs it, and even at a penalty hit's him in the head and kills him. Only thing Belin say's is \"I think I'll keep this.\" \n\nWe head back to the village and inform the mayor of the story. He tells us that some elves had escaped and will be happy to have they're home back. He sends some of his guards to gather up all the dead bodies and clear the town so that the villages can come back. He rewards us for a job well done. Belin then spends the next couple day's in the woods using the large size club to build strength. He's practicing knocking trees down in one hit. Then sending the lumber back to the town for the people. DM likes what I'm doin and say's Kord admires my strength and drive to get stronger.  The villages are happy to have the extra wood for they're crafting and such. Some of the shop owners make Belin a nice new bed, a table, several chairs, and a great deal more stuff for his house. The party is starting to realize that building your character through roleplaying is paying off big time for Belin.\n\nPart 8 up soon... I hope",

        "text": "I GM a weekly game for a fantastic group of roleplayers. There are 7 total players, 4 of which rotate in and out based on work schedules (we're all in our late twenties to early 40s.)\n\nCast:\n\nDong Jenver - the nutter and amateur demonologist\n\nDr. Motius McMillan - the group psychoanalyst and weapons specialist\n\nRoxy - Prostitute turned agent\n\nChris \"Dawn\" Blackmore - Computational sorcerer, and recent recipient of a magic doppleganger sex change (used to be a girl)\n\n\nThe game is set in the universe of Charles Stross's \"The Laundry Files,\" and is based on the ruleset from Chaosium's Call of Cthulhu. We play it a little rules-light, really only going through ALL of the motions when something significant happens. See a monster? If you've seen it before, no Sanity loss. See a long-dead elder God? Ok, start rolling sanity. That kind of thing.\n\nThe game centers around a British secret agency called Capital Laundry Services, tasked with confronting occult and extra-dimensional phenomena. They use technology to access magic, thus allowing agents to carry out exorcisms, seances, and other occult practices with relatively little risk. The structure of Capital Laundry Services, or the Laundry as it is known, is very bureaucratic, so the end result is like \"The Office\" meets \"The X-Files.\"\n\nThe agents have previously traveled to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to assist with site STONEFORGE, which is a secret facility where anomalous persons and objects are stored, run by the Laundry's American counter-part, The Black Chamber.\n\nThis week's session was a smaller one, with only 4 players, so instead of starting a large campaign, I opted for a one-shot where they get to explore some of the anomalous objects and persons of site STONEFORGE.\n\nSite STONEFORGE is based on a site featured in the fictional wiki \"The SCP Foundation.\" http://www.scp-wiki.net/\n\nSo the PCs have just gotten back from a mandatory 3 week training/vacation suspension after their previous handler agent died mysteriously.\n\nThey arrive and told to meet their new supervisor, Dr. Geoff Kondraki, in a specific auditorium. After meeting with him, they are informed that their task for today is to interrogate a man that believes himself to be a werewolf. He was captured crossing the border from Mexico into Texas, and murdered 3 border patrol agents before he was brought down. The PCs began to mentally prepare themselves for this assignment, and their new \"boss\" recommended getting started with some coffee.\n\nIn typical corporate fashion, coffee with the boss trumps actually working, and it can be detrimental if one doesn't. So they accompany Dr. Kondraki to the break room and encounter SCP 294, a coffee machine/computer that will produce any liquid typed into its terminal. Dr. Kondraki demonstrates this by asking for a very specific Colombian coffee with cream, and the machine produces as requested.\n\nThe players delight at this, and the PCs begin ordering things like \"Thousand-Year old Whiskey,\" and \"Dunkin Donuts coffee\" followed by \"Bailey's Irish Creme.\" Dr. Kondraki then requests \"Nitrogen,\" and the machine produces it in liquid form. Dr. Kondraki then demonstrates that the cups are also anomalous and will contain any liquid that the machine produces, perfectly insulating the outside of the cup from the effects of the substance produced. The Liquid nitrogen sublimates in the cup, and Kondraki dumps it to the floor, where it immediately sublimates and then Kondraki crushes the cup.\n\nThis leads to this exchange between two PCs, the team Doctor/psychoanalyst and the nutter, a crazy old man that's a neophyte to sorcery and computational demonology, particularly resistant to the sanity damaging effects of practicing magic due to his mental derangement.\n\n(Nutter) Dong Jenver: \"I enter the blood of Christ.\"\n\nMe: It dispenses a semi-viscous red liquid.\n\n(Doc)Dr. McMillan: \"I think you just proved that Christ was a historical figure.\"\n\nDong Jenver: I drink it.\n\nChris enters \"molten steel\", and the machine produces molten steel. The players toy around with the machine for a few more minutes before indicating that they are ready to move on to the interrogation.\n\nThe interrogation takes place like so: The subject is in an interview room, shackled to the floor and handcuffed to the table. The PCs are in a control room adjacent to the interview room, with a microphone and some other controls. Dr. Kondraki explains that the interview itself will be conducted by two D-class personnel (former death row inmates employed on 30 day contracts that require them to participate in dangerous experiments,) and that he has built a light source that emulates the refracted properties of moonlight, by attenuating the photons to a particular wave pattern and frequency, with the exact same latency as light reflected off of the moon.\n\nThe D-Class personnel enter the interview room wearing suits and earpieces and the PCs are instructed to communicate with the D-class with the microphone, and Dr. Kondraki leaves to attend to another project, under the assumption that there's no way that these guys can mess this up, because there are no such things as werewolves.\n\nThey began the interrogation with a few questions about his history and affiliations, which a little research (knowledge rolls) proved to be fictitious in nature. Then the fun started. They began to quiz him about his wife and kids, and through the safety of their proxies began to insult, insinuate, besmirch, and down right threaten his family. Notable examples:\n\nCalling his kids \"pups\"\n\nAsking if his wife liked \"Doggy Style\"\n\nCalling his wife a \"Bitch in heat\"\n\nInsinuating that they had in fact, walked her around on a collar.\n\nAll the while, trying to convince him that the source for these vicious rumors was Geoff (Dr. Kondraki.)\n\nThis angered the subject, who began to threaten the proxies. After several extremely lucky rolls, the subject broke the links holding him to the floor and lunged at the men across the table. He catches one of the proxies by his wrist and repeatedly slams his head against the table, knocking him unconscious. \n The other proxy heads to the door, demanding to be let out. \n\nAt this point, the PCs said \"Hit him with the light,\" and when they activated the light, Tio Lobo went into convulsions.\n\nSince we're all adults and have had our imaginations assaulted by TV and movies, I always model the appearance of my NPCs after well-known actors in iconic roles. It's easier to remember the research team when it's comprised of Liam Neeson in a ginger wig and beard, Beth Riesgraf, Jeff Goldblum in Jurassic park, or in this case, Tio Lobo being Danny Trejo.\n\nTio Lobo changes into a werewolf of the Howling variety, the transformation being very American Werewolf in London/Paris -ish. He then breaks through the chains holding him to the table and mauls the other man in the room. He then began to beat on the one-way mirror.\n\nAt this point, I let the PCs do their actions, and every 30 seconds, I rolled for another barrage of blows against the window. \n\nI encourage the players to all act at once and then like an auctioneer, I'll point to one whom has expressed a wish to act, and we'll resolve it, pausing all other game actions until the move, attack, request or whatever is resolved, then we go back to the auction. The players seem to enjoy being able to act immediately, and this enables me to paint the scene in my head, which I can then describe to the players so they all know what's going on.\n\nSo panicked, Roxy's player exclaims \"We need to get him to a happy place!\" Then whips out her smartphone and looks up \"How to calm a werewolf.\"\n\nThey settle on silver being the panacea and Dong Jenver remembers SCP 294 and heads off to get some silver from the coffee machine. While he does this, I adjudicate several actions from other players, one of which is Mcmillan, who wishes to shoot him through the glass with a laser from his cellphone, made by trapping light in an entropic loop, thus amplifying it, using the camera as both the light source and the viewfinder. The shot hits, and the werewolf's chest erupts in flames. Jenver reaches the machine and procures two cups of molten silver. He then stops, and the player asks if the machine has a drain under the spout, for unwanted or overflow, and I inform him that it does. Jenver then pours some out of each cup, \"so I can run without spilling any on me.\"\n\nOnce again, the nutter proves to be crazy, like a fox.\n\nHe heads back and arrives just as uncle wolf barrels through the glass, crashing into Dr. Mcmillan and knocking him to the ground. Dong Jenver pours both cups of silver onto the beast and it hisses as it burns him. Tio rapidly changes back into a now nude danny trejo, and Chris uses a magic geas to bind him to laundry service, essentially drafting his ass for government work. They call in the maintenance crew to repair the damages to the room, and to bring an extra set of coveralls for Tio, because they are intimidated by the size of his package.\n\nAfter they get their coveralls and the maintenance crew cleans up the D-class, they all retire to the break room, and play with SCP 294 a bit more, delighting in \"milk of the poppy\" and other archaic drugs and alcohol. It's 2pm after all, and they have earned it.\n\n\n",

        "text": "My first experience with tabletop roleplaying was a Pathfinder game focusing on the return of the Cult of Elemental Evil. In the party we had a sorcerer that was constantly causing problems in and out of character to the point that the DM forcibly changed his alignment to chaotic because he would do things like throw lit torches down a goblin warren. This is what happened when he decided to split the party.\n\nOur group consisted of a half-elf paladin, a half-elf druid [me], a gnome rogue, a gnome alchemist, a half-orc fighter, and the human sorcerer. We were staying in an inn and at the inn we saw two sorcerers from the Cult of Elemental Evil. \n\nOur Paladin, who tended to not think things through when he saw evil, ran downstairs to confront the two sorcerers and the rest of the group followed. The sorcerers immediately attacked us in the inn full of civilians and summoned two large magma elementals. \n\nThe inn was slowly being engulfed in flames and the party was going back and forth between fighting the sorcerers and their half-orc assassin that could go invisible and trying to save as many civilians as possible before the structure collapsed.\n\nThe sorcerers had bracers that made them immune to fire so they had the fun ability to cast fireball at their feet. We eventually kill the sorcerers and the assassin right before the inn collapses. My druid summoned wolves before using Wildshape to turn into a wolf helping her animal companion (also a wolf) use the scent ability to rescue the civilians that were trapped in the ruble as well and helping the town's medics treat some of their wounds.\n\nAfter the events were settled with the authorities in the town we decided to start back to our base which was in the process of being expanded to a full military base with barracks for the war against the Cult of Elemental Evil. Our Sorcerer decided he wanted to stay in the town to get the bracers off the bodies of the sorcerers we had just killed.\n\nEven I, who had very little tabletop gaming experience, knew this was a bad idea. We told him in character and out of character \"This is a bad idea. Don't split the party.\" The DM told him out of character \"I am not giving you those bracers.\"\n\nThe sorcerer wouldn't listen so we left and he went in search of information about the bracers. The town we happened to be in was notorious for being run by a Thieves' Guild. As he was walking through the crowded part of town in front of the Mage's College the DM had him roll a perception check. He noticed nothing and went to a pub to talk to some Divination mages from the college. Only then did he notice that his staff, which was a Staff of Electricity that cost about 32,000 gp and was given to him by the Church of Iomedae as the symbol of his rank in the military had been switch with an identical staff with no special abilities. By the time he had noticed, the staff was already on a ship out of his reach. \n\nTL;DR: Pain in the butt sorcerer wouldn't listen when we told him it is a bad idea to split the party. Gets his Staff of Electricity, which was a gift from the Church of Iomedae and the symbol of his rank in the military, stolen by a member of a Thieves guild. ",

        "text": "*What follows isn’t somethin’ most people would consider excitin’. Truly it’s a bit of fiddle faddle, but it provided us with a good laugh. Especially since all of the posse and the marshal (who is loose on the game-mechanic-rules, I should add before anyone familiar with them freaks out) were full as a tick.*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Let me introduce you to the two fellers who are makin’ their way through the Weird West, currently in Tucson Arizona, ary of ‘em leaving behind a trail of bad medicine wherever they set their beetle-crushers.*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Mad Max**\n\n\nThe first of our ‘big’ bugs is a feller they call Mad Max. The name says it all. He’s a real noisy ‘un, ain’t knee high to a lamb. He tells tall tales of ‘magical elixirs’ wherever he goes. Real blusterin’ and catawampus and practically afraid of his own shadow.\nHe’s got these two donkeys pullin’ his carryall wherever he goes, though there’s been some talk that the ‘potions’ he creates in there aren’t real. The local folk would see him as one of them bunko artists sellin’ nothin’ but burrow milk.\nThe rest of the posse considers him a bit of a hitch, though they’ve been hittin’ the flats together for months. He’s the one who keeps the pot a boilin’.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Cooper Bennett**\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe second in our lil’ fandango is a real grum bulldozer of a man called Cooper Benett who don’t care a continental. He’s hot as a whorehouse on nickel night and has the same John B. on his head and Justins on his feet since his skedaddle from the north. He’s been around in Arizona for a while, tryin’ to hide from the law which is certainly lookin’ for him up there. \nHe looks though he’s been through the mill, clothes and skin dusty and browned from his travels. A short-tempered man with zero tolerance for fiddle faddle. Looks as though he’ll buckle to just about any task and when they end up fat in the fire he might try and fix it full split.\nHe enjoys his girls of the line paired with a gut warmer, but no matter the goings on he’s always packin’ iron. Even when he’s buck-naked takin’ his annual bath. \nHe’s got hard money but haint got a mind to hifer. Never wake this man by shaking or touching him, as he might wake suddenly and shoot you.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n________________________\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The posse had just arrived in Tucson, Arizona, lookin’ to find a bald man known to be dabblin’ in the wrong kind of native ritual magic. From what they were used to, this place was bustlin’. Leaving Max and his carryall behind, Cooper – looking quite biggity in the boodle - headed into town lookin’ for an ace-high hotel to spend the ridiculous amount of Eagles chinkin’ in his pockets.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;By the bye he came across a fancy lookin’ place called The Silver Queen. This place resembled what he was used to seein’, however rather than one foldin’ door this place had three. The place was built out of sturdy bricks and the light shinin’ out onto the porch looked unusual.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Cooper stepped in with a chirk of his tongue, his wary eyes scannin’ the room as the jangling of his can openers carried him. Lamps with bulbs dangled from the ceiling and he was able to trace the cables from each of them out of holes in the wall. \n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;He walked up to the man behind the desk who looked to be readin’ today’s paper. He cleared his throat to get the other’s attention. The coffee boiler of a receptionist did nothin’ but give him a disinterested look before turnin’ back to his newspaper.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Cooper wasn’t one to be known for his patience and everythin’ had been balderdash lately. He gave the desk a clout and barked: “Hey!”\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This seemed to get the receptionists’ attention and he lowered the paper revealin’ his ugly mug. He was tall and skinny with a crumb-catcher over his lip and a bald-spot on his head he was tryin’ to hide by combin’ his thinnin’ hair over it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The look on the receptionists’ face was expected. It wasn’t common for scruffy lookin’ folk like Cooper to set foot in the most costly hotel in Tucson. He must have thought the cross-grained lookin’ guy came there to crawl his hump.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Howdy,” Cooper said, “I’m lookin’ for two rooms for an… unspecified amount of time.” \n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The receptionist looked him up and down, smirked, and turned back to his paper.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Cooper wasn’t used to bein’ ignored. Usually his grand stature was enough to bend most folk to his will but this man was crooked as a Virginia fence. However he had no intention of gettin’ kicked out back into the dust from which he came, so he dunked his hand into his pocket and pulled out a satchel ready to burst. This made the newspaper a whole lot less interesting.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A dusty hand pulled the coil off the satchel and proceeded to toss a small fortune onto the desk. “Two rooms.” \n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Just as the receptionist was removing the keys from the hooks on the wall, Mad Max entered the hotel, immediately cuttin’ a figure by trying to squeeze his entire body inside a dumbwaiter. Cooper tossed him a key and the curly wolf cut a path upstairs.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Max, even though it was early mornin’, sat down at the bar and already rocked his chair back and forth as he waited for the bar dog.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Howdy, sir,” said the mustachioed keep once he’d put away the glass he was cleanin’, “What can I do you for?” \n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“WHISKEY!”  Barked Max.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Whiskey? Sir, the city’s bustlin’ with folk durin’ the day. I doubt it’s wise for you to go on a bender this early. Just have a beer.”\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Mad Max complied with the keep’s suggestion and was shown a beer that looked quite a bit different from what he was used to. It had a label on it. The picture showed a bald man holdin’ out the same bottle of beer and a thumbs up, which in turn had the same picture on it etc. The barkeep imitated the pose just before handin’ the bottle over to Max who drank it up like it was cow juice. “Fine as cream gravy!”\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;He quickly asked for a second and as the alcohol was beginnin’ to mess up his head, Max’s famous tall tales made their entrance.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“So me, Cooper and Alice were in this dark cave,” he began, “And we couldn’t see nothin’. Cooper wouldn’t turn on the lantern you see, because we’d heard some strange noises from inside and he was afraid it might be somethin’ like a monster comin’ to neck us! But –,” he took another swig, “Alice and I felt magic in the cave. Cooper didn’t feel the magic because he’s a coot. So I told him – right – I told him; you’re nothin’ and you can’t do anythin’! And I know it hurt his feelins ‘cause he became angry.” \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Nobody (*not even the player behind the insane character*) had any idea how Mad Max’s brain worked. But lookin’ at the photo of the bald man on the beer-bottle gave him an idea. If they were lookin’ for a bald man, of course he should brew a hair-growth-elixir. That would lure every single bald man in the city over to him!\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;With cracked eyes he began murmurin’ to himself for what seemed like a coon’s age. He mentioned the beer he drank would be a perfect base to his drink, since a bald person made it. But there were other things he needed… The barkeep seemed to have taken a cotton to him though and he listened, havin’ a laugh every now and again. Mad Max didn’t think it was funny though. He had a severe expression on his face as he cut dirt toward the receptionist. This time he was severely cut up in a book.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Hello there, wondrously beautiful behind-the-desk-man. You’re goin’ bald,” Max stated as he thoroughly inspected the receptionists’ comb-over, “Can I have some of it?”\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Some of what..?” The French-accented receptionist asked a lil’ down in the mouth.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Your comb-over!” Max replied, his voice slurred from bein’ a lil’ fuddled.\n\t“My… what? Non. What would you even use eet for?”\n\t“Asshole,” Max muttered under his breath, “I can pay!”\n\t“You’re not gettin’ my ‘air for anythin’, get a wiggle on and get on outta ‘ere.” \n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Max too pulled out a satchel ready to burst and rained nearly sixty dollars down onto the desk.\nThe receptionist slowly pulled open a drawer and took out a pair of scissors. He held up his comb-over and snipped it off, layin’ it down on the desk. Before Max had the time to thank the man for his ‘business’ he’d collected all the money in his pockets and had bolted toward a door on the other side of the room. Max could hear “I KWEET!” and before he (or the players) understood what had just happened, the now ex-receptionist had got a wiggle on himself and left the hotel never to return again. Neither Cooper or Max were aware that both their offerings to the receptionist had made him, to those day’s standards, very rich. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;All Max needed now was hair from a longhaired man. Because that made perfect sense. He got the wrong pig by the tail deciding on Cooper, because Cooper had been present every damned time somethin’ went wrong with his elixirs. But Max was the type of guy who would go the big figure.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Just as he was runnin’ upstairs he caught a glimpse of a tall man wearin’ a bathrobe over his clothin’, but Max had more important things in mind. “COOPER!” he yelled as he climbed the stairs two steps at a time. He went at it hammer and tongs when he threw open the door to Cooper’s room, only to find it empty.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;With a bunch of hellabaloo Max made his way back downstairs and outside, still screamin’ his companion’s name at the top of his lungs. But Cooper was nowhere to be found. Max would need to find the long hair somewhere else… The barber!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And thus the man dressed in all purple, with his tall top-hat bobbing up and down, ran along the street looking for the barber which he found a few minutes later.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;He entered the building lookin’ like horse feathers and breathing heavily.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“I… I need long hair. Long hair from a man. I can pay! - You look like a stereotypical French man...” \n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The barber wasn’t a man who asked many questions. He disappeared out back and came back with a snippet of long brown hair, which he showed to Max.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“How much?” he asked, lookin’ at Max as though he was loaded to the gunwhales.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Max hadn’t a clue how much coin he had on him, so he just repeated the same process. Dunk hand in satchel and make it rain!\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The barber slid the hair over to him across the table and gladly accepted the money, however tellin’ from his limsy expression Max made him a lil’ uncomfortable.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Now with three ingredients on hand that in Max’s mind all made sense and correlated perfectly, he made way for his cart where his beloved machine was waitin’ for him.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;He crawled inside and wrapped himself in a blanket of linsey woolsey, adding the ingredients to the machine one by one. Beer brewed by a bald man, the comb-over of a man trying to hide his baldness and the hair of a man who was very definitely not bald. He listened to the bubblin’ and frothin’ with closed eyes like it was the most beautiful music he’d ever heard. He might have even enjoyed it more than the sound of his banjo.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;After an hour it was done and he scraped the long and short of the process into a glass bottle. It was a rather unnatural shade of blue and smelt of a ladies’ perfume. Max was confident that a brew with such a lovely smell would surely sway the towns’ bald folk to drink it. His first ‘test-subject’ would be the bar dog from The Silver Queen. So there he ran.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Told you!” Max yelled as he flailed himself through the room and somehow managed to land on one of the stools at the bar without a scratch, “Told you I’d invent a hair-growth elixir!” He pressed the bottle under the nose of the barkeep.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“That ain’t real,” the man replied with a grin, “You’re just playin’ to the gallery.” \n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“No, no! Look!” Max uncorked the bottle and brought it up to his lips, takin’ a full swig before standin’ still and starin’ into the barkeep’s soul waitin’ for somethin’ to happen.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Suddenly his hat started to rise a little and soon his head was feelin’ a lil’ tight. The barkeep watched everythin’ unfold with eyes like saucers. Max tore his hat off his head, squeezing the brim in excitement. Slowly his hair started to grow and soon it pooled in luscious locks on his shoulders. From the back (and front, if it wasn’t for the moustache) he looked like a woman. Several patrons of the hotel burst out in a fit of laughter, but Max hadn’t ever felt embarrassment. \n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“HOLY SHIT!” the barkeep blurted out, “YOU HAVE HAIR!” He proceeded to snatch the bottle out of Max’s hand and take a big gulp out of it himself.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“You look like my mother in law!” A patron yelled while laughin’.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The barkeep then ran to the nearest reflective surface, which in this case was a bucket of water, and watched his own hair grow. Soon he too had a wondrous amount of female hair to call his own and the patrons began to laugh even harder.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Holy shit! I look like your mother in law!”\n\n_____________________\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnd so ends the tall tale of how Max Max made Every bald man in the pub look like Bob's mother in law. I'll give you a cookie if you can figure out the clue we missed during these scene. Just so you know, we haven't found the bald man yet. ",

I picked up the game about 5 days ago. I needed something to eat up time while I have a nasty knee injury.\n\nTook me about 2 days to figure out how to squad up, and \"jack into\" a large scale battle with a platoon. Eventually I picked up pace and leveling.\n\n2 nights ago there was an enormous battle happening at the bio labs. My platoon was having trouble breaking through the chokepoint on the landing pads. I had a brilliant idea that I would cammo across the platform, and follow the dome around to the rear platform, and infiltrate quietly.\n\nThis plan worked wonderfully until I ran smack into an entire squad in the doorway of the other platform. Complete with 4 Mechs, looking like they were about to all take off and cause hell.\n\nThey spotted me immediately and opened fire, and with nowhere else to go, I sprinted toward the open platform, about to commit suicide when a glorious, epic sight caught the corner of my eye.\n\nA liberator painted all kinds of cool cammo and emblems and such was *expertly* bobbing and weaving through the legs of the facility, avoiding gunfire, and most importantly of all, right towards me. I was going to jump anyway, so I just aimed instead.\n\nI landed on top of the Liberator with one little pulsing shed of health left, and immediately started sliding down the side when the option to enter finally came up, like a sign from the gaming gods.\n\nI managed to get it off, and finally into the aircraft where the pilot (a level *58*) immediately noticed and says:\n\n\"Jesus shit! Did you just jump off the platform and into my lib?\"\n\n*Ah, yep*\n\n\"That is the most badass shit Ive seen in this game, I thought someone was just killing themselves\"\n\nAt this point I was beaming and replied:\n\n*Theres a whole squadron on that platform about to take off, want to swing back around?*\n\nHELL YES!\"\n\nI switched to the bomber position and we shot up to the platform. First, I took out the aircraft on the platform. 3 kills. My pilot, \"LTBarnutz\" is swaying like a pendulum, I rain down on the mechs. 3 kills. I let loose in the doorway, 4 more random kills.\n\nWe start getting pelted from above. I switch to gunner while LT is doing his best to make me vomit, and we manage to take down a mosquito. This guy is fucking awesome at flying.\n\nWe swing around to the other platform, taking down 2 turrets. We rained hell on the choke, and the doorway. At this point the Liberator was red, and LTBarnutz yells something that sounded like an attempt at Japanese and shot us into the doorway of the platform, taking out who the hell knows how many people with us.\n\nThe platoon leader is screaming to push, and we hear reports of a squadron finally breaking through, and dropping a spawn beacon. I get a friend request from LT, and we regrouped at Vanu.\n\n\"That was some fun shit huh?\"\n\n*That was some of the best 15 minutes of gaming I've ever had in my life*\n\n\"Want to go again?\"\n\n*Hell yes!*\n\nSince that night we've probably had a combined 10 hours of Pilot/gunner together. We picked up another friend last night, and now we hop from hot point to hot point, \"DROPPIN HUUUGE LOADS\", as LT likes to put it. Turns out he's disabled and retired. This stands to be an epic partnership of awesome.\n\nAlthough I will *not* change my playername to \"Chewy\", as he keeps insisting.\n",

        "text": "There was a thread asking about the largest combat you've run in WoD. My story doesn't make sense without the details of the plot arc. Not to derail the thread, I'll post it separately. \n\nI was one of the STs on a WoD MUSH. (Online, text based RPG, included Camarilla, Sabbbat, and Garou). I decided to run a story arc. I love making the antagonist not be some super powerful creature. I find the less powerful ones to be more interesting.   \n\nSo who was my bad guy? A PENTEX employee testing a new product. The product? A solid gold 'vinyl' record with a bane spirit bound into it. Listening to music made with that record (or mixed with it) had the following effect:\n\n1. When a human listens to the music, they make a willpower roll. You only need one success to not be affected at all. If you fail this roll, you are compelled to do whatever command is mixed in with the music (often played backwards). Additionally, if you fail, future rolls to resist are made at a -1 penalty. (It is addicting) \n\n2. Extended exposure: After your willpower penalty is equal to your total willpower pool you cannot resist the music's commands. You continue to accrue penalties to the roll (even past 0).\n\n3. When your dice pool goes negative, You roll the amount of dice that your penalty exceeds your willpower. 'failure dice', so to speak. See below.\n\n**Failure Roll Chart** \n\nSuccesses | Effect\n---|---\n0-5 | Irritability: Anger, Poor impulse control. Similar effect as \"roid rage\"\n6-7 | +1 increased strength, visibly increased muscle mass by next day, +Irritability.\n8-9 | +1 increased stamina, +Irritability.\n10+ | Human listener becomes Fomori. \n\nThe event started small. I posted posters around town for a new DJ appearing at a local club (One of the few not vampire owned).\nAt the club, he played his (terrible) house and techno music, which had the following commands embedded. \"Buy a CD of this music. Tell everyone else how much you love the music and play it for them.\" \n\nA week after the performance, groups of youths started appearing in the streets, hanging out with boom boxes, blasting terrible house music, and trying to sell CDs of this DJ's music. Often being quite pushy about it. (We've all encountered these sort of folks RL..)\n\nA week later I notified the rest of the staff that any vampires who rolled a feeding complication should all have the same sort of experience - they encounter one or more of this DJ's fans, and they are surprisingly strong, with good soak, and are quite single minded in getting them to buy a CD (to the point that lower level dominate/etc won't work on them). Irritability would also make them quick to provoke into a fight. \n\nThe Camarilla were the first to catch on that something was happening. When six different vampires all encountered the same sort of thing they decided to investigate. (They, of course, easily dispatched the offending youths and still got their meal, but they weren't used to having to work for their supper with mortals.)\n\nThe Sabbat soon figure out something is amiss and decide that whatever it is, they want control of it, since it looks like a great way to drive the Camarilla nuts. \n\nThe Garou end up noticing one of their kinfolk acting strangely, and even attempting to bring a boom box to the caern. A quick \"Sense Wyrm\" reveals the CDs are tainted, and a pack is put on the case of finding out what is going on, while the kinfolk is purified and the boombox and CDs destroyed. \n\nA further week later a rather senior Camarilla member and two neonates are walking out of a club one evening when three such youths, wearing the DJ's logo hoodies and looking rather 'bulky', try to push the CDs on them. The elder tries to grab the first 'punk'. This punk happens to be a full fomori now. He has 3 fomori powers. \n\n**Tar Baby**: The Fomors skin is made of a thick, sticky substance like molasses or tar. Anything that comes into forceful contact with the skin will stick to it like a fly on flypaper - This includes Garou, or others trying to grapple, punch or kick the Fomor. Objects such as clothing which are slowly slid past the skin will not stick, only forcefulness activates the power. This also allows the Fomor to disarm others, as the stickiness gives the Fomor massive leverage.  \n\n**Plasmic-form**: The fomor can literally melt into a puddle of thick reddish-brown liquid which can move about of its own free will. The liquid has the fomor's usual number of soak dice\n\n**Phoenix Fire**: The Fomor can self-immolate, becoming a walking bonfire. The flames do no damage to the Fomor but will ignite any flammable item they touch. \n\nThe fomori activates all three powers. The elder now no longer has a grabbed punk, but instead is covered in *living, moving,* ***napalm***. The two neonates fail their Rötschreck rolls, and flee. The elder barely making it away as he finally gets free and books it as well. The entire encounter is captured on a video by a club goer, and ends up on the news. \n\nNeedless to say, by this point, all three factions are going all out to find this guy, perfect time for him to announce a **FREE CONCERT IN THE CITY PARK!** Turns out the mayor is a fan, and he got all the permits he needed in amazing time! \n\nThis is where my largest combat occurred. The night of the concert, where we pick up our story, I had the three factions (about a dozen camarilla and garou, six sabbat). The Camarilla have dominated their way backstage as the DJ performs, waiting for the right moment to grab him quietly as he gets off stage. The Garou are in the park with the audience, trying to get to the stage from the front(one of them literally up a tree to get a better view), and the sabbat are in the parking lot outside the temporary fencing set up for the event in the Sabbat-mobile attempting to grab a few late-comers to the concert to fill up their bloodpools before going inside. \n\nA moment to explain about the Sabbat-Mobile. All sabbat players had decided to spend 5% of their XP each month on improving their lair and this vehicle. This had been sort of a standing agreement for YEARS. So the Sabbat-Mobile by now looks like a large hummer. Actually, it is closer to a tank. The front grill has silver, iron, and wooden spikes covering it, the lights (normal and IR illuminators), the dashbord has normal, nightvision, and infrared view settings for the cameras, the cabin can be sealed and the air evacuated (since vampires don't need air it makes for great security system). Run-flat tires, and a built in fire-suppression system... and of course, it is all sorts of bullet-proof.\n\nAs the concert goes on, fights break out, the mosh pit becomes more of a massive brawl. Security completely loses control, and things are generally becoming a mess. The werewolf in the tree pisses off some thugs who decide to light the tree on fire, the rest of the pack is trying to push their way (one of them in glabro) through the pit of brawling humans to get to the stage. \n\nIt is at this point that the Sabbat-Mobile comes crashing through the side fence, right into the pit of brawling humans and werewolves. Blood and tire tracks left in its wake, one of the werewolves gets impaled on the front hood (don't forget the silver spikes!). The rest of his pack goes chasing after the Sabbat-Mobile, as it barrels towards the stage. The DJ stops playing and starts grabbing his things, clearly planning to exit stage left, as shit has clearly hit he fan. Not wanting to miss their chance, the camarilla vampires rush the stage from behind. The Sabbat-Mobile plows into the stage and comes to a halt. \n\nSo lets review, we have a (now crinos), almost dead, werewolf pinned between the hood of this tank-car and the stage, the Camarilla coming from the back of the stage. The Sabbat piling out from the front of the stage, and a pack of werewolves hot on their heels... This is when the DJ sets off all the pyrotechnics at once, to cover his escape, as the stage lights up in torrents of flame and sparks.  \n\nAbout a quarter of the Camarilla and one of the Sabbat fail their rotschrek rolls. The rest plow towards the DJ and eachother, the levels of the mess that culminated are difficult to describe. A massive brawl between all involved, as they all also attempt to grab the DJ. One of the Camarilla managed to get the record, several PCs died, and when finally the DJ was cornered he cries out, \"Oh god this is going to hurt...\" before activating the one fomori power he actually had. \n\n**Gift** (Signal Rider) \nThe gift that lets you travel along the connection line of a phone call. Combined with his implanted headset and a call back to the pentex home office meant...\n\na lot of pain. Some blood. And a DJ that disappears, leaving behind just his implant and part of his ear, on the ground where he was standing. \n\nIt was an amazing plot line to run. I was hoping the Camarilla and Sabbat would get interested in hunting down some more Pentex stuff (There were a few local subsidiaries) but the following weeks quickly devolved into political infighting and the 'buisness as usual' as the Camarilla were content to merely keep the record out of other's hands. They weren't able to activate it for their own needs as none of them could use a fetish. And the werewolves went back to guarding the bawn, happy the 'threat had ended'. Cest la viv. \n",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2vduiu/deadlands_hoe_an_angry_indian_a_salacious/",
        "text": "So over the last few months I've been running a game for my group called Deadlands: Hell on Earth. It's a strange hybrid of Cyberpunk 2020 and the Wild West set after the world bombed itself to oblivion using Ghost-Demon infused nukes that not only irradiated most of the world, but haunted it as well with giant radioactive tornadoes made of demons. Also this released the four horsemen of the apocalypse who then saw how fucked the world was (Just as they planned) and then pulled out the chain-dildos and proceeded to amp up the fuckery to 11 across the continental US, and then eventually the world. Or what was left of it. Everywhere they rode (or suffered a direct Ghost-Bomb attack) was turned into a \"Deadland\", a place where physics sticks it's head in the sand to avoid looking at all the pure CANNOT BE that spawns from the tainted soil and fauna, places where just walking around and thinking of something scary can and will bring that thing to life and then murder you with it in horrible ways you couldn't have ever imagined. The books call this process of deadifying the land \"Terrorforming\". Ha ha. 'Cause the horsemen feed on fear and use it to ... y'know.. the thing. Yeah we get the picture. \n\nThe only way to counter the spreading deadlands is to counteract humanities fear by spreading hope, joy, and bravery. To be a hero and inspire others to acts of courageous heroism!\n\nUnfortunately if such people exist they've probably been either directly or indirectly killed, mutated or left to fate in a Deadland by the Player Characters. \n\nThese goons running around the Wasted West are:\n\n[**Engine Joe**](http://imgur.com/aLgag3J): An angry, racist Native American mechanic, who also practices the art of being a Toxic Shaman, which more or less means if he takes a puff of his peyote he can talk to irradiated spirits and convince them to give him super powers, like shooting beams of radioactive black lightning from his fingers to give people explosive, fast acting testicular cancer or converting the entire atomic mass of his body into pure energy. For fun, should he ever die in his energy form, he will release energy equivalent to 3.4369e+3 megatons of TNT, which would equate to a bomb powerful enough to level the entirety of Washington State. Fortunately he hasn't run in to anyone he's hated enough to perform such a... sacrifice. He specifically went out of his way to name himself Engine Joe so that people would mispronounce it as \"Injun Joe\" so he would have an excuse to hate them and give them testicular cancer.\n\n[**Cable Hardpecs**](http://imgur.com/S2HPkC7): A bullheaded, violent irradiated meatpile with delusions of heroism. He practices the art of Hamo- er... Radon, a fusion of martial arts and radioactive power. He seems to think flexing is a substitute for verbal communication, and casual kung fu inflicted bodily harm a language. Anything not within roundhousing distance is subject to his radioactive Kamehameha, which he throws around with impunity. The player seems to think he's the Joeseph Joestar of the Wasted West but he mutated himself a pair of wings so he's probably more like the Kars of the Wasted West and I've been making all offensive rolls against him as if he wore nothing but a loincloth and an aura of fabulocity.\n\n[**Nell**](http://imgur.com/B4O8WRm): A lascivious, deceptively dorky looking Librarian girl who has a condition where her criminally short temper has been crosswired with her violent sexual fetishes. Despite being the least combat oriented character she has managed to bully and terrify the rest of the group with a combination of violent sex and sexy violence into doing things her way all the time. Is searching the Wasted West for a book written by her grandfather, and possesses the ability to mimic the personality of any person or character ever written about in a book, fictional or non-fictional, perfectly.\n\n**Ms. McCoy**: One of the few remaining McCoys, roams the wasted west as junker, a person with equal parts mechanical genius and occult brilliance, constructing miraculous devices out of the scrap and junk found around the wasteland and powering it with the tormented spirits of the damned. Perhaps the most neutral and level headed of the group, unfortunately the player was unable to continue playing past the first two sessions due to real life issues and took any semblance of \"lawful\" or \"good\" or \"neutral\" with her.\n\n\nThe party starts off driving on a long stretch of dusty highway somewhere east of the Mississippi river in Engine Joes [Ferd Fteenthousand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8P5vGcf-NU) when they notice some guy flagging them down off the shoulder next to a beat-up Winnebago. Joe pulls to a stop as Cable hops out of the back to heroically inquire about the mans troubles. The man, named Will, says he's a junk trader on his way to a settlement called Tulpa in what's left of South Carolina. Will has run out of fuel and pleads with the party to lend him a bit of [Spook Juice](http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?619013-Deadlands-Refresh-my-memory-What-exactly-was-Ghost-Rock) in exchange for their choice of his junk haul. This somehow leads to Cable terrifying the poor man by convincing him that Spook Juice is made of Skeletons that will devour his flesh in his sleep. The party then briefly considers robbing the man, but Joe was the only one with any sort of skill in driving and figure it would be too much trouble to have one of the others attempt to drive. \n\nSo they calm the man down, and offer to convoy with him to Tulpa. Forty miles later, they come across 4 armed men in Kevlar watching over some scraggly underfed looking guys laying new concrete across the various potholes and shattered sections. One of the armed men stops the party, and informs them they cannot pass due to a reconstruction effort by the New United States Army. Cable jumps the gun and goes straight to attempting to intimidate the armed man by standing heroically in front of him, flexing his disgustingly huge muscles. He fails his intimidate roll and angers to man, who throws a punch.\n\nCable, through some fuckery of his kung fu skills and the die rolls, manages to catch the man's fist in his hideously overgrown pectoral muscles, and then proceeds to CRUSH it nigh effortlessly by flexing, rendering it down to a bone and meat paste. The rest of the guards are alerted by the now one-handed mans cries of pain. Through some careful application of sex appeal by Nell, the others are assuaged of their wrath and blame is squarely put on the man with the useless hand. The men then offer to pay the party if they help them finish their roadwork. Not ones to turn down easy money/fuel/scrap, the party obliges, only to learn that this roadwork is being done on behalf of the US Combine, the remnants of the former Confederate and Northern Alliance military (In this alternate future the civil war didn’t end in unification) The Combine started out with good intentions but then something happened to the leader of the movement and now their imperialistic thugs going around enslaving the rest of the country. The party all had a beef with the combine, so they immediately slaughtered the remaining soldiers and the road crew, continuing on their way.\n\nEventually the party gets to a highway and begins heading west. Engine Joe spots an off ramp and a gas station not to far away, but a gang of raiders riding motorcycles and two pick up trucks drive up the ramp and attempt to ambush the party by surrounding them. As the leader attempts to extort the parties Spook Juice and Scrap for their lives, Nell comes up with a cunning plan to seduce the bikers and steal THEIR scrap and fuel. She manages to make the pants shorter of the bikers behind the truck and begins luring them towards the bed of the Ferd Fteenthousand, but then she got bored and decided shooting them was a faster way to get what she wanted, plugging them both in the guts and causing negotiations to immediately break down in a confusing cacophony of bullets and radiation blasts. Engine Joe takes a puff of his peyote and calls upon his radiation spirit guide to give him the power of the CANCER RAY, which he wastes no time in zapping the Raider Leaders balls with, causing nasty tumors to rapidly consume his crotchetal region until it turns black and falls off, and killing him. McCoy pulls out her Junk Gun (think of a backpack mounted version of Fallout 3’s Rock-it launcher) and hoses the truck in front of them with rusty screws, thumbtacks and old bayonets, shredding most of their faces. Before the men in the remaining truck can escape of attack, Cable Hardpecs charges his RADON BLAST, Kamehameha-ing the truck with a ball of exploding radiation, spattering bits of DNA all over the vicinity. \n\nThe party having won it’s first fight, scavenges what parts they can from the non-irradiated vehicles, and then proceeds to drive off the offramp and raid the gas station for all it’s worth. Cable and Engine Joe, in their ransacking of the gas station, find out that the gang they just wiped out was using the gas station as a base of operations, selling whatever they scavenged or stole to a town twenty miles down the road called Tulpa. Further investigation leads them to find the last remaining gang member holed up in the back office, whereupon Engine Joe and Cable Hardpecs attempt to torture information out of him by holding him down and having Cable flex his disgusting mongoloid Double-Mr.-Universe muscles at him in such hideously veiny ways that after thirty straight minutes of it the gangers mind broke. The party, having gained food and fuel from the station, leave the mentally ravaged man behind and continue on to the settlement of Tulpa...\n(Will be continued in the next post)",

        "text": "[First part is here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2uj8u2/rogue_trader_ork_trader_finale_part_1/) LET'S GO WAAAAAGH!\n\nWe last left our intrepid heroes after clearing out the Inquisitorial Headquarters upon Holy Terra. Mostly by accident, thanks to dice loving Maggrim.\n\nWith Holy Terra in complete disarray, Da Krew is feeling pretty confident about their chances of turning Terra into a giant Rok.\n\nBut as the party is cleaning their weapons and looting everything, Kaptin Gazbag gets a shocking message over his komms. \"OI BOSS! IT'S DA SPES MAHREENS!\"\n\nThe entire Ultramarines chapter had been dispatched. Unfortunately, they had somehow successfully navigated the warp without the Astronomicon. They had already destroyed Kraftwurld Illiner and were making landfall.\n\n\"BACK TO DA WAAAAAGHON KREW!\" Da Krew legs it back to their ship and flies into battle, attempting to destroy drop pods and support vehicles before they reach the ground. Unfortunately, Gazbag isn't the best of pilots, we didn't do that well.\n\nZagbar, having no real role during ship to ship combat, spent this time brewing a huge vat of [Megajuice](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2p3m56/rogue_trader_more_tales_from_aboard_the_waaaaaghon/).\n\n\"Oi! MAGGRIM! I got'z dat 'Urty Juice ya boyz wanted!\" The meganob walks into the room and takes the Megajuice down to the hold and starts eating it all with his Warband.\n\nWe make landfall near the main bulk of the Ultramarines forces, knowing that we're about to enter a pitched battle. Da Kaptin calls in all his boyz for one final tactics meeting. **\"LET'S GET EM BOYZ! KRUMP 'EM UNTIL DEY DON'T KRUMP YOU BACK! WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!\"**\n\nWaagor speaks up from the back of the crowd. \"OI! WHERE'S MAGGRIM?\" So it turns out that Maggrim and his boyz and power klaw'd their way through our cargo hold and fucking JUMPED OUT OF THE SHIP into the middle of the Ultramarines.\n\n\"SNAGAGRUB! GET US DOWN THERE!\" Snagagrub glows green and mutters feverishly; \"'Ere we go, 'ere we go, 'ere we go.\" Da Krew (and only da krew, not their warbands unfortunately) glow green and teleport down to the battle.\n\nThe battle against the rank and file Ultramarines goes pretty well, surprisingly. Maggrim is on a timer (and he knows it) so he goes absolutely ape, taking on about 5 assault marines himself. Waagor's Insquigitor (as he is now affectionately called) ate a tech marine. Snagagrub blew up a Chaplain's head. Good times.\n\nWith the smoke clearing, a huge hulking Space Marine steps up. With huge power fists with bolters strapped to them, an iron halo, and freakishly large armour, Chapter Master Marneus Calgar joins the combat. Luckily, he moves last.\n\nKaptin gets to move first and opens fire with a looted Tau Pulse Rifle, which does nothing. Zapstrak moves next and fires a Rokkit Launcha, which hurts him, but only just. Snagagrub buffs the party, then hides. Waagor charges into melee combat with a looted Eldar Power Spear, and manages to put a dent on him. Zagbar injects himself with some 'Urty Juice.\n\nFinally, Maggrim da Maggrim gets his turn, and charges straight at Calgar, dealing some decent damage with dual power klaws. Then Marneus punches him into a building and Maggrim explodes. He dead.\n\nThe rest of the combat goes considerably better. Calgar kills the Insquigitor, which we were all very upset about. Zagbar runs to Maggrim's exploded remains and finds his Shokk Attak Gun, Snagagrub attempts to teleport Maggrim's Warband into the fray and fails. Waagor does surprisingly well in melee combat.\n\nOn his next turn, Zagbar fires the Shokk Attak Gun into the fray, killing both Calgar and Waagor. Waagor luckily has fate points left, so is only severely wounded. He loses an arm as it is sucked into a warp hole. They quickly loot Marneus' body and flee.\n\nDa Krew hurries back to the ship, their warbands having successfully ~~crashed~~ landed the ship without them. They leave just in time to watch the rest of Maggrim's Morons explode. Zagbar fixes Waagor with a new Power Klaw to replace his arm, while da Kaptin builds a shrine to Maggrim in the hold, housing a power klaw, his Shokk Attak Gun, and the Gauntlets of Ultramar. Snagagrub managed to collect the spores from Maggrim's death, so he also houses them in the shrine, to grow new idiots.\n\n___\n\nDa Kaptin stands up to deliver another famous speech. \"WE LOST MAGGRIM! BUT MAGGRIM WAS A GOOD NOB! HE KRUMPED EM ALL! HE KRUMPED DAT BIG 'UMIE! NOW WE'Z GONNA KRUMP DA BIGGEST HUMIE! LET'S GET DA HUMIE WARBOSS!\"\n\nDA WAAAAAAGHON! rockets off to the palace, firing off potshots at anything that looks vaguely religious, important, or \"not Orky enough\". Snagagrub is having a great time, breathing huge green fireballs at humans from their position in the sky.\n\nThey make landfall just outside the palace. Waagor, (now awake) sends his Squignites in to scout the area, only to have the squigs return riderless mere seconds later. Obviously concerned, Da Krew advances cautiously, weapons ready. They spot a shining golden light, and immediately open fire with all of their ranged weapons. A single warrior steps forward, wielding a large spear. One of the Emperor's Companions.\n\n\"Vile Xenos, you shall not harm our most Glorious Emperor!\" Waagor steps up, infuriated at the death of his Warband, and his friend Maggrim. \"OI! YOU KRUMP'D MAGGRIM, YOU KRUMP'D MY BOYZ, SO I'Z GONNA GRUMP DA EMPRAH!\"\n\nThe combat goes poorly. Waagor is killed in the first round, and is now out of fate. Waagor is dead. Da Kaptin spends three rounds trying various weaponry, all to next to no effect. Snagagrub tries to squig him, and fails. Zapstrak opens fire with his formerly corrupted heavy bolter, and Zagbar takes up the role of melee with his 'urty syringe and power klaw.\n\nBut slowly, we whittle him down. Da Kaptin gets the final blow, blowing off his head with a blast from his Kustom Mega Blasta. After looting the Custodes, and Waagor, the party pushes onwards to the throne room. We have a couple more fights with weaker Custodes (I think at this point the GM was being nice to us), and we finally reach the Golden Throne.\n\nDa Kaptin looks confused. \" 'E AIN'T BIG! WHY DO DA HUMIES LISTEN TO YA!?\" The Emperor, being pretty much dead and all, doesn't reply. So Da Kaptin shoots him. The Emperor of Mankind is now truly dead.\n\nFor those of you who don't know, The Golden Throne and the Emperor serve to protect humanity from Daemonic incursion. Without him on the throne, daemons start to pour out of holes in reality, and the campaign ends.\n\nDa Krew spend the rest of their lives fighting an eternal war against daemons in the heart of the Imperium of Man. Over the next century, humanity becomes extinct with their scattered defenses and the overwhelming might of the xenos.\n\nDa Krew has won.\n\n___\n\nSo that's the end of Ork Trader. My main game now is ANGRY SQUAD, and a Shadowrun game in which nothing worth posting about has happened. I'll still be posting, but that's the end of the adventures of DA WAAAAAGHON.",

        "text": "In the first session, which can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2sg7ze/pathfinder_alcoholic_spelunking_an_all_dwarf_party/), three young dwarves who are degenerate alcoholics even by dwarven standards found themselves in a fight for survival against several [Duergar](http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17172/1324376-duergar_abduction_by_benwootten.jpg), whose domain they'd fallen into after a mining accident. Emerging victorious, they were offered jobs in the newly formed Deepwardens, a dwarven order dedicated to protecting their civilization from the Underdark's horrors.\n\nThe morning after their induction into this ancient sacred order, Jozen the skald, Barazun the cleric, Glorin the ranger, and Durgen the fighter are drinking their breakfast in the largely deserted tavern hall when they are approached by the Master Brewer, Bofdal Granitehand. He's a bit mad-looking, with stark white hair and a beard that seems to be charged with static electricity. He raves briefly about his hops being possessed, after he reached his hand into a barrel and was apparently bitten. Bofdal is convinced that his entire brewery is haunted, and tells the heroes of the day that if they deal with the ghost, they'll drink free forever. \n\nThis deal is too good for our heroes(?) to pass up, and so they enter the well-lit and warm-smelling brewery, which to be honest doesn't really seem to be haunted at all. Until Bofdal leaves, and something at the far end of the room catches Glorin's eye. A tankard seems to floating in mid-air next to a wall stacked floor to ceiling with aging barrels. \n\nGlorin, being the perfectly rational day drunk that he is, decides to take a couple of potshots at it, missing wildly and putting small holes in the barrels behind. Barazun laughs at his friend's aim, lowers his helmet, and runs headlong into the tankard smashing it flat against the barrel behind it. \n\nThe rest of the party can only look on in horror as the topmost barrel falls off it's supports and lands squarely on the cleric, the subsequent tide of ale throwing him backwards off his feet and soaking his clothes and beard in beer. He's never been happier, but Glorin and Jozen have taken notice of small shadows flitting around behind the barrels, and it looks like the fight is on. \n\nBarazun gets to his feet, but almost immediately an unnatural wave of ale surges up from the pool and knocks him back on his ass. Small creatures have crawled out from behind the barrels to hurl darts at him, and Glorin recognizes them as gremlins. Jozen bursts into song about how great it is to be surrounded by so much beer, and his raging song sinks in to his teammates. \n\nThe gremlins employ flanking hit and run tactics that make their hilariously ineffectual blows an actual problem for the party. Jozen, Durgen, and Glorin move around the room engaging with the beasties repeatedly and keeping them off Barazun long enough for him to cast *enlarge person*, jump to his feet, and headbutt a gremlin standing on top of a barrel rack. While the rest of the party dispatch the gremlins in the ale pool, this gremlin keeps Barazun occupied by throwing ice-spikes and summoning more ale-waves that knock the dwarves off their feet. Durgen is dropped by one of these ice spikes, but seems in no danger of dying. \n\nUntil the cleric lands another blow, and the gremlin surprises them all by summoning a blanket of fog to hide its movements. Barazun hunts for it blindly while Glorin, Jozen and Durgen step back to get an eye on the whole picture.  \n\nGlorin spots the gremlin creeping away on the left edge of the cloud, looses an arrow which narrowly misses, and alerts Jozen, who looses an arrow which narrowly misses. Jozen interrupts his song to shout to Barazun that he should charge to his left, which the gigantic dwarf does, plowing headfirst into a stone wall and [knocking himself unconscious.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK6TXMsvgQg)\n\n The archers loose more arrows at the thing until Glorin finally manages to land a killing shot, and while Jozen is making sure his friends are still breathing, Glorin looks for shiny things on the gremlins' corpses (finding a wand of *hydraulic push* for his efforts).  \n\nThe dwarves haul their comatose brethren from the brewery to the nearest temple of Mya, where they pick up some healing, a light sermon on family values, and Jozen regales an attractive acolyte with a tale of their Duergar-killing exploits, securing a date. The rest of the day passes rather uneventfully, with the Four Stooges cashing in on Bofdal's reward and drinking themselves into a complete stupor. \n\nBy the next morning, they're starting to get the hang of this “not working in the mine all day” business, and think they'll coast through it drunk again. That is until Moram Halfspear, their former mining foreman and current Deepwarden S.O., barges into the tavern and drags them all down to the new defensive bulwark the builders have been constructing around the site of their last fight with the duergar. They are introduced to Sven Earthbreaker, an odd, quiet dwarf with strange eyes and oracular powers, and Kilgar the Sledge, a shaven-headed lunatic with a very sharp axe. These two will be accompanying them on the mission they're about to embark on, and Durgen will be staying behind. \n\nThe five of them are charged with reconnaissance of the Duergar tunnels they've uncovered, so the Deepwardens will have some idea what they're up against. Following a long-dry aqueduct from the central reservoir, the party walks for some time in the silence beneath their town. There's no sign of life, or even of death in the tunnel, just the dust of ages. \n\nThat changes when they reach the tunnel's end, and find a doorway obstructing their passage. Kilgar goes to examine it, but finds the floor suddenly missing beneath his feet, and vanishes from the rest of the party's sight with a short stream of curses until he lands hard fifteen feet below. Movement is seen behind previously unnoticed arrow slits to either side of the doors, and as crossbow bolts begin to fly, Glorin runs to the lip of pit trap and in one smooth motion drops flat, hammers a piton into the stone, and drops a rope to Kilgar. \n\nSven runs for the nearest arrow slit and throws down an *obscuring mist* which fills the tunnel and blinds the entire party. Jozen begins to sing a raging song about how much he hates the Duergar, and Barazun bellows curses and challenges at the mist while casting a spell to set his helmet on fire. Glorin and Sven, close as they are, can see the doors open as the Duergar struggle to find targets through the fog.\n\nKilgar attempts to climb out of the pit, but as Glorin reaches to give him a hand, a crossbow bolt emerges from his left eye and he falls backwards into the pit, limp and silent. One of the duergar shouts excitedly, and Glorin swears to kill the gray faced monster. Sven has been trading blows with the second bowman, who has revealed himself to also be a skilled unarmed combatant.\n\nBarazun, meanwhile, is sick of this fog. Helmet aflame, he charges blindly forward, launching himself from the lip of the pit and slamming headfirst into the startled duergar bowman that's been kicking Sven in the face, driving him backwards and breaking several ribs. Glorin takes advantage of the distraction to finally put his trident through the chest of Kilgar's murderer, and only then does he actually stand up, having been on his back since he initially dropped the piton. \n\nBarazun, now out of the fog, finds the interior of the duergar stronghold to be an ancient dwarven structure, now covered in fungus and graffiti. Two more duergar are standing within, with oddly constructed crossbows pointed at him, but he ignores them in favor suplexing his wounded opponent backwards into the pit trap that surprised Kilgar. \n\nThe duergar both fire on him before any of his companions can enter the room, and he discovers that crossbows fire bolas bolts, dangerous entangling contraptions that he manages to dodge. Jozen, entering behind him, is less lucky as a bolas shot takes his legs out from under him. Glorin and Sven emerge from the mist next, Sven electing to heal Barazun, and Glorin hurtling his trident at one of the duergar bowman, sadly missing completely. Barazun chooses this moment to cast *enlarge person*.\n\nThe tide has turned, with four dwarves now facing down two duergar, but these are clever foes. They manage to flank Barazun and wound him badly before Sven gets in a lucky shot that forces one of them to drop his sword. Glorin is taking potshots with his shortbow but failing to land any killing blows, and Jozen is maintaining his ragin song when Barazun, once again towering over everyone in the room, lands a headbutt that reduces one of the duergar to little more than paste. The other, surrounded, makes a desperate grab for his dropped weapon, but his arm seems to have actually broken under Sven'sstrike, and in his clumsiness he leaves himself exposed to no less than three killing blows. \n\nThe party stands victorious for less than a second. They can hear angry shouts coming from doors on two sides of the room, and know they have little time to prepare. Sven casts oil about the room, Barazun and Glorin take up positions of readiness with their reach weapons, and Jozen gets ready to swing his hammer at anything that comes through the final door. \n\nThe doors near Jozen swing open first...with no Duergar in sight. Cursing the powers that granted the gray dwarves natural invisibility, Jozen swings his hammer blindly – and with a spray of blood a duergar flickers into sight, falling backwards, head pulped by the skald's home run swing.\n\n++Continued in comments++",

        "text": "[More campaign stories!](http://redd.it/2ue20h) Now then, when we last left off, [the party (consisting of Rose the Dullahan Ranger, Fishnaut the Gillman Sorcerer, Pratena the Cyclops Murderchild, and Barrel the Halfling Rogue)](http://imgur.com/a/kBl11) had just gotten into a little tizzy where their mercenary employer had to suddenly relocate because politics. It was one hell of a move, teleporting their mountain- not the base, the entire goddamned mountain- to a completely new area. Unfortunately, spell components aren't cheap, and their employer was now flat-broke.\n\nBut luckily, Barrel had a spiffing idea: they were very close to an old \"friend\" of his who had an incredible abundance of cash, which could be liberated for the good of the organization. Said friend went by the name of Duke, and he was Barrel's old owner from when Barrel had been a simple slave. To put it mildly, there was some bad blood between them. It also helped that the Duke was incredibly wealthy and a huge twat.\n\nThe only problem was that the man was also technically the head of a small nation, which was currently engaged in hostilities with about four other nations. Also, the Duke had barricaded himself in a keep, stuffed all his wealth in there, and the entire area was sealed off by a huge wall covered with armaments.\n\nThe party's boss recommended they first visit the wizard who had moved the base, as the man was quite skilled at teleportation. They set out, and met the grouchy bastard (who was indeed very powerful, and also a complete jackass) and convinced him to lend assistance through the promises of cash, booze, and entertainment.\n\nWith that, the party set off for the keep and the fortune within. Only problem was that there were at least four nations between here and there, and none of them were particularly friendly. So they came up with a genius plan...\n\nWhen they crossed the first border, they were charged by a bunch of orcs brandishing weapons and screaming. It petered out as it got closer.\n\n\"Aw, man, LOGGERS? Why couldn't it have been adventurers or an invading army...?\"\n\n1/5 NATIONS PASSED\n\nThey rolled unconcerned into the next area, a nation of fanatically precise gnomes. They were stopped at the next border by a bunch of guards in uniform demanding papers. Barrel stepped up to bat.\n\n\"Well, as you can see in form 18-delta, we've got a redirect from...\"  \n\"Uh-\"  \n\"...Carrying over onto the Manticore sheet, with signatures by the...\"  \n\"Yeah, but-\"  \n\"...Of course, had to fill out the W-7-1-J, along with-\"  \n\"YES I CAN SEE THAT EVERYTHING IS IN ORDER IN YOU GO.\"\n\n2/5 NATIONS PASSED\n\nUp next was an exceedingly small nation that was apparently based on a floating island of some sort, with soldiers riding pterodactyls flying everywhere. The party kept their heads down and just marched on through, but after a while they were once again stopped, this time by the air patrol. Barrel brandished his forged documents and began quoting bullshit bureaucratic-ish things that were more powerful than any mere spell. The party trundled forward, in the wake of the soldier's weak protests from underneath their now-comatose mounts.\n\n3/5 NATIONS PASSED\n\nLast but certainly not least was a nation of monsters. This was the final nation between the party and their goal, and the most active of them. Various magical creatures were camped outside of the wall bordering the Duke's lands. They were not going to get through this one with a bit of fast-talk.\n\nThe monsters noticed the party (and how they had slipped practically unmolested through three goddamned nations) and brought them to the leader of the monstrous forces- a shifty creature that was completely invisible. He held the title of Pitboss, and was very interested in what a bunch of humanoids were doing this far into their territory.\n\nBarrel poured it on. He explained that he was there to topple the nation that the monsters were fighting, and that with the monster's cooperation, they could win a decisive victory and all get rich in the process. Barrel detailed the virtues of having a goddamned castle, hundreds of indentured workers, natural resources galore, and the wondrous world of weapon-and-armorsmithing. The Pitboss was a bit hesitant to devote himself t such an effort, but Barrel carried it off so well that the Pitboss himself decided to back this play.\n\nThe Pitboss gathered his best (and most loyal) men to join the party on a frantic charge of the wall. The party led the way, assuring everyone they had a plan. As they got close, the dickass wizard got their message and teleported the massive barrier about a mile into the air. All according to plan.\n\n4/5 NATIONS PASSED\n\nThe party charged on through, with the Pitboss and his forces not far behind. When they were in just the right spot, Barrel shouted \"NOW!\" and the dickass wizard put the wall back where it was. That is, he accelerated its fall so that it landed directly on the Pitboss's forces. ***SPLAT***.\n\nThe dickass wizard found this absolutely goddamned hilarious. The rest of the party, who were not in on this plan, were considerably less amused. Shouts of \"WHAT THE HELL, BARREL\" nearly drowned out the sound of the approaching mercenary forces belonging to the nation that, oh yeah, they were technically invading.\n\nBarrel screamed, \"THEY WENT THAT WAY!\"  \n\"WAIT, WHO? AND WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?\"  \n\"THEY'RE GETTING AWAY GO GO GO!\"\n\n5/5 NATIONS PASSED\n\nWith that, the party made its way to the keep where the Duke parked his fat ass. Trouble was, it was a keep, and not the kind of place that it's easy to break into. There might have been some secret passages or ways up over the wall, but the place was guarded by the Duke's best mercenaries (some of whom were familiar with Barrel) and would probably not take kindly to this.\n\nSo Barrel revealed the ace he had up his sleeve: Today, of all days, was the Duke's birthday.\n\nYes, I rolled for that. It really was the Duke's goddamn birthday.\n\nThe party promptly disguised themselves as a, well, party wagon. Rose covered herself with a sheet to make it look like she was a giant cake, Barrel painted some fanciful wine name onto his barrel, Pratena hid under some blankets, and Fishnaut took the fore. He announced that they were there for the Duke's surprise birthday party. When the mercenaries in the keep asked why they hadn't been informed about this, Fishnaut pointed out that it was a *surprise* party.\n\nThe mercenaries decided that they weren't paid enough to get between the Duke and a massive fucking cake- it would be suicide. The party was allowed in, and showed to the throne room.\n\nThe Duke's fat ass and seventeen chins wobbled with glee when he saw the party wagon. He oozed forward, demanding he be allowed to get his pudgy hands on the cake (and the stripper it hopefully contained). Fishnaut told him to calm down for a moment first, and peruse his selection of fine wines. The wine was vengeance-flavored, served cold, and roughly halfling-shaped.\n\nBarrel's gloating was cut a bit short, because they had a few problems. Although they had incapacitated the Duke, they didn't have a good way out of the keep, and the Duke would probably wake up in the middle of their looting. So, with the application of a well-placed knife and some fire magic, they removed the Duke's tongue. Then they proceeded to unlock the door to the treasure-room basement and do a good imitation of Scrooge McDuck.\n\nTheir looting took over an hour. Several times, the mercenaries knocked to find out what the hell was going on, each time sounding a bit more suspicious- they couldn't hear the Duke screaming orders and whinging. Eventually, the mercenaries barged in and... asked to be cut in on the loot. The Duke didn't exactly have a big fan club. The party cheerily agreed, directed them to the basement... and then Barrel barred the door with a massive amount of chairs, tables, beds, pianos, and caltrops.\n\n\"It's personal.\"\n\nThat done, there was one other issue... that of the Pitboss. See, through ~~metagaming~~ intuition, they had correctly guessed that he was still alive, and he would likely be SUPREMELY pissed. The invisible bastard was going to hunt them down and kill them all... or he probably would have, if not for one important detail. That being, the party was holed up in a goddamned castle.\n\nThey rigged traps on all the doors leading to the throne room, and on the round that Pitboss entered, he was pelted with greasy smoke pellets (robbing him of invisibility) and a hail of swords and arrows. He didn't even get to attack- he went down in the first round.\n\nThat done, the party went home. Seriously, it was that easy. The mercenaries that HAD been working for the Duke were thoroughly distracted by the invading monster forces (an open door is an invitation, after all!) and the rest of the nations were quickly following suit. Pterodactyls, frog-dudes, lizardmen, all of them were mounting offenses and nobody seemed to be bothered about the innocent loggers' caravan with the totally innocuous tarp over what was probably a beanbag. After all, there were plenty of other people to fight.\n\nThe party made off with a million gold pieces, not counting the various artifacts. They gave about half to their employer, and a little bit to the dickass wizard (who was quite happy to receive the Duke's entire wine cellar), and the rest went towards the mother of all shopping sprees.\n\n[NEXT TIME ON \"The carrot or the greatsword\", VISITING FAMILY AND SOMETHING IN THE DEPTHS!](http://redd.it/2x08f5)",

        "text": "So I've been bored outside of school recently so I endeavored to create a dwarf concentration camp to give myself some purpose.\n\nThe [Death-Camp of Loving](http://imgur.com/NAYBr7q) was founded to dispose of the undesirables of society in the name of the king. The first 10 Dwarves of the fortress took care of all its needs, from mining out the death chambers to making goods for trading with the other species and pretending we were a trade depot and not a hovel of untold suffering.\n\nAlso, we needed to trade for the finest goods as my executioners needed to have nice things for happy thoughts, they were going to see a lot of death over the next few years. Thankfully the volcano we settled on for the evil fortress had [plenty of valuable ore](http://imgur.com/M7cmaRn) and I set off to work.\n\nI dug out two pits with long channels above them and filled them with magma, mining out a ledge around the pit, and sealing off the entrance with a floodgate attached to a lever. By this time I had [quite a few migrants](http://imgur.com/wfOkqNm) and needed to get my murder industry rolling. I sent the first squad into the gas chamber and recruited [a Water Buffalo](http://imgur.com/YO62JT9) as the driving force to produce the deadly gas, by dropping it into magma from a great height.\n\nUnfortunately it turned out a Water Buffalo is not heavy enough and I was stuck with a room full of still alive dwarfs with more coming in. The solution was gold. Gold nuggets were heavy enough to create the [necessary splash](http://imgur.com/9moke7q). It was a waste of money but anything less than our all for the extermination of the unclean was unacceptable.\n\n[Success!](http://imgur.com/lX9ybZd) Half the prisoners are dead and the others are miserable! After a few rounds of dousing in noxious gases and melty rock, some of the prisoners began to [lose it](http://imgur.com/9iDX9E8), even getting to the point of [indiscriminate murder](http://imgur.com/2mJbwA7) between inmates. At the end of the first year of immigrants I had two survivors. [Catten](http://imgur.com/6VYaaYJ) was freed from his chamber due to his unbridled joy in slaughtering his fellow dwarf and made the new blacksmith since we lost ours along with another guard to a werelizard. [Shem](http://imgur.com/n4rBpY6) held out for months on vermin before finally giving into dehydration.\n\nAs the gas chambers were losing efficiency, I created [chambers full of retractable spears](http://imgur.com/GDOrzHF) to expidite the processing of new arrivals. It's construction had kept me busy and away from training my guards to be a competent military, whence came my downfall. The allies set their [newest weapon](http://imgur.com/QFCZEUC) upon my fortress and my military was only barely competent. Spears only chipped the beast's crystal skin until one brave dwarf delivered the [killing blow](http://imgur.com/9H8QkcO).\n\nHowever the damage had been done and the fortress was doomed. My own men [lie dead](http://imgur.com/n684Yb3) just outside of the room where they had just exterminated 20 dwarfs. We had made our mark however, there were [more bodies](http://imgur.com/zFFZvxS) tossed in a pit topside to terrify migrants along with a road into the death chambers that was lined with slabs with the names of all those we had purged engraved on them. One dwarf was left to man the spear room and [the self-destruct sequence](http://imgur.com/81mb9jA) was triggered to [flood the complex](http://imgur.com/BPsAkqq) with magma and ensure the allies could not recover our war materials or our research and intel.\n\nThe [lone remaining adult](http://imgur.com/M4pVBWR) had just massacred one of his children along with many strangers in the spear traps and now he was subjecting his daughter to the same fate. To her credit, she survived for [20 pages](http://imgur.com/zU8BTxS) of combat logs and I contemplated letting her out multiple times, but ultimately she had to die as I could not allow survivors. Her father was allowed to mine into a magma resevoir and secure his release from his miserable existence. In the end over 50 dwarves lay dead in the name of the king. Unfortunately my short attention span and the FPS gods decided that I could not slaughter more.\n\nMy next fortress shall be half in a terrifying biome so I may use the corpses of the undesirables against new arrivals and even family members. It's not dwarf fortress until you have a mother having to battle her undead infant who is attempting to mercilessly slaughter her.\n\n",

The six confused adventurers look up into the air to figure out where the sound is coming from. The only thing in the cloudless sky is a large airship. It appears to be descending rapidly, and soon careens into a riverbank not too far off from the campsite. At this point, the mud is disheveled, and a rusted staircase swings down from the side of the ship. \n\nCautiously, the six climb the staircase, wary that it might give way. The side of the ship has faded lettering on it, reading \"T_e W_ath_rlig__,\" When the bulkiest of the group steps foot onto the deck, the floorboards groan with each step. A hole in the boarding reveals a deck below that appears mostly empty. Despite better judgement, the party descends into the gallows to see a mostly empty hold, with a black door and two gargoyles in the back of the wide open space. The vampire steps forward and grabs ahold of the doors' handle and immediately jolts back. His sharp howl is followed by a string of gibberish, and can only be made out to \"So much death... so much suffering...\" The other five help the undead back up on his feet and decide to return to the surface to escape the dreaded ship. \n\nAs the party comes to the deck, six chests with various crests appear around the crow's nest. The crests on each one are [an hourglass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:TimeSpiral_expsym.svg), [a row of columns](http://mtgsalvation.gamepedia.com/File:ALA_symbol.png), [an ornate triangle](http://mtgsalvation.gamepedia.com/File:GPT_symbol.png), [a pen head](http://mtgsalvation.gamepedia.com/File:RTR_symbol.jpg), [two herons](http://mtgsalvation.gamepedia.com/File:ISD_symbol.jpg), and [a wing](http://mtgsalvation.gamepedia.com/File:LRW_symbol.png). Somehow each of the creatures knew exactly which chest was theirs, all they had to do was speak their names into the box, and the secrets within would be theirs.  For the kobold, he stated he was, Rizzax, the cleric; for the giant, his name was Uunkalo, the druid; for the earth elemental, he was Loch, the barbarian; the weird stated that he was Tattered Pages, the sorcerer; the vampire muttered that he was Evard, the rogue; and lastly was Vasari, the wizard. Since the adventurers had now all been introduced, they each opened their chests and received their bounty bestowed upon them by the oracle: A small kit of basic supplies, as well as rations and a small sum of gold. \n\nAs the chests were emptied, their minds were invaded yet again: \"I see you have all found your equipment, good... Your first journey will be a perilous one, wrought with distrust and fear. I have discovered that Thousand Faces is currently in Innistrad, and that he shall ruin that plane for all eternity if given the chance. You shall now go there and stop him now, lest he destroy more. You will find keys in your packs that shall open up the black door below. Go now, and do not fail me.\" The voice subsided and Rizzax was yet again writhing on the ground, screaming about the voices. Uunkalo picked the small being up and placed him on his shoulders. \"Worry not, little goblin, I shall protect you.\" Rizzax sniffled and forced a smile. Vika simply looked at the curious blue monster and started to make notes in his scrolls.\n\n\n(This is getting pretty long, so i'll split it up into parts, not too much actually happened, just a whole heck of a lot of plot)",

        "text": "To start with some context I was the half-drow. I had a previous character in the current campaign who had left because his weapon was destroyed (it was sentient). So I had an ally of that character come to take his place.\n\nThis character was a female half-drow and unfortunately my DM (though quite innocently) decided to place me on top of their carriage waiting for them as they exited a pub of some sort while information gathering. The party's levels were in their teens and they didn't take kindly to this.\n\nThe party consisted of an elf wizard, some sort of cleric (he had a warforged with him or something), a human swashbuckler, a Dwarf character who was some class devoted to a god and swinging hammers also multiclassed as a Paladin, then whatever my character was at the time. Which just now happened to be a half-drow rogue.\n\nThe wizard immediately lifts my character off the wagon and between him and the cleric they use various enchantments to make sure I can't do shit at all. They don't immediately kill me probably because we're in town and they weren't murder-hobos. The dwarf was closest to that. More on that later.\n\nAfter some interrogation regarding my identity and using a zone of truth they determine my character is indeed there to help them and is a good character. She is aligned good and her reason for being there is to cover my previous character while he goes on his own journey. Dwarf Paladin thing doesn't buy this and constantly detects evil on me and once tries to smite me. When we're in town and short on money he says that I'm a rogue and that I should rob people for it. (My character is a Ninja archetype, not a rogue-thief type) We collectively sigh and I don't do this and I move on to other methods.\n\nMoving on kind of far in to the campaign I've been reincarnated as a full drow and we're in a castle that's located in essentially a pocket dimension. We must go through trials in order to advance. We all do fine until we get to the \"Bonding Room.\"\n\nThere's a total of 5 of us. The cleric and wizard get bonded. They brofist and make it through the door. Me and the dwarf and the swashbuckler get bonded. The swashbuckler doesn't hate my character so much but he's not a fan. The dwarf on the other hand, seeing that he absolutely won't try and bond with a drow attempts to kill my character. The human will bond with the dwarf and me but the dwarf won't bond with my drow. Apparently his god isn't a fan of Elves and Drow are at the very bottom of the list, despite knowing I'm a good character and also that being full drow was not my choice.\n\nHe levitates in to the air with his bullshit shoes or otherwise he'd have a very hard time killing me, as he hard a very hard time doing it while levitated even though he can throw a magic hammer that will always return to him.\n\nMy character does everything she can to survive, but eventually she falls and no one tries to save her. However, I've done some damage to the dwarf. What occurs is justice porn.\n\nThe dwarf immediately loses his Paladin levels for killing an innocent. Then his constitution is reduced by half of it's max upon the bond being forcibly broken. This kills the dwarf. Our swashbuckler doesn't have a lot of HP. The bond being broken from the dwarf reduces his constitution and then kills him as well.\n\nWe all die in the room right before the boss. OOC the wizard and cleric weren't even there and have to fight a Lich alone (but do so fantastically, mostly because our DM didn't want to screw them over because of what just occurred.) They come back and are just like, \"Oh, everybody is dead then? Kinda saw that coming.\"\n\n(Hey guys, first post. I don't get to DnD much but I hope you like)",

        "text": "Allow me to tell you of my 3 friends first experience of combat in Dark Heresy. I'll introduce their characters, using their nicknames I have christened them with IRL\n\nCynic, the Gunslinging Space Cowboy - A cross between Clint Eastwood and Chuck Norris. Well thats what he was going for, but it mutated and became edgy along the way. best Ballistic Skill out of the three.\n\nSmiles, the Noir Detective - An imitation of 1920s/1930s American PIs, Smiles is a smooth talking, lady loving, last good cop in this city kind of guy. Also later gets addicted to drugs and almost destroys a warehouse, but does are two different stories\n\nPsycho the Psyker - The zealous, crazed wild card. If he didn't have Psychic powers he would be annoying. But Psychic powers make him a ticking time bomb of craziness. Also comes up with creative solutions to problems and the most well versed on lore.\n\nThe three have found a minor criminal named Phil in a bar. After interrogating him and making him the group mascot (he had a comedically squeaky voice and had a family, so they decided rather than kill him have him tag along), they find out were more prominent gangsters are living, and go to lay down Inquisitorial justice.\n\nThe party roll up at the place and formulate a plan. They decide to empty Phil's stub revolver before giving it back to him, in case he turns on them. the plan is for Phil and Cynic to go in the front, with Cynic pretending to be interested in joining the gang. Meanwhile, Smiles and Psycho will find another way to enter. They go down an alley and find large dustbins allowing them to climb through a window on the upper floor.\n\nPhil and Cynic, after being talked to through the front door, are allowed in and see that there are four gangsters in the building. Maurice, the guy at the door and second in command, taunts and mocks Cynic slightly, leading to a few quippy one liners. The other two make their move and enter the building through the window. Since its an old, wooden house they have to make stealth checks. Psycho passes…\n\n…Smile doesn't.\n\nDownstairs, guns are drawn instantly and Cynic leaps into the corner, flipping over a table for cover. Phil retreats behind the wall, back into the entrance. Smiles pulls out his autogun and positions himself on the stairs. And Psycho pulls out his Chainsword.\n\n\"You do realise that there is no one upstairs?\" i tell him.\n\n\"Yep.\"\n\n\"So what are you going to do?\"\n\n\"I cut through the wooden floor in a circle around me with my chainsword.\"\n\nI allowed it.\n\nPsycho falls through the floor and he cuts it away, landing with a thud on a larger, second table in the room. And so began the worst combat ever witnessed.\n\nThe leader of the gangsters pulled out a sword and began duelling Psycho on the table, neither of them able to hit or damage one another. Smiles, thinking he was badass, begins rapid firing and missing. Cynic, being the only competent one, manages to score a few hits on two of the gangsters.\n\nAnd there was Phil and Maurice. Phil and Maurice both pull out their stub revolver and laspistol respectively and blast at each other. Of course, Phil's stub revolver is empty. The group collectively gasp in horror as phil is blasted at…\n\nMaurice misses. Combat continues, with Phil pulling out a knife and grappling with Maurice. Smiles still misses everything, and Cynic smashes a gangster's head on the table when he gets too close, before vaporising his brains. Psycho is using telekinises to try and get the gang boss to stab himself, but it isn't working.\n\nEventually, Cynic guns down Maurice, freeing Phil, and badly injures the gangster not duelling Psycho. Smiles, finally hitting, finishes off the gangster, full auto. Psycho is still struggling against the gang boss.\n\nThen Phil, proving he has balls of steel, throws himself at the gang boss. Only to be thrown against the wall and knocked out. However, he buys Psycho time, who destroys the gang boss's head with a strike from his chainsword.\n\nAnd so ended the stupidest combat ever seen.",

        "text": "First let me start off by saying sorry for not posting in a while. I've had food poisoning and a terrible time at work. Makes it hard to write or play when I'm doin nothing but sleeping. This is a story from a short game that we played due to my sickness and us missing 2 players. We tried for a longer one but it was too hard and we called it early. I did manage to do a lot of fun stuff for a sick guy tho. \n\nJust like last time I'm only posting a link to the last story. If your just now joining our hero follow the links to read his humble beginnings. If you've been keeping up with him... here is part 6 :D\n\nPart 5-https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2u28my/dd_355e_mix_the_tale_of_belin_the_raptor_master/\n\nWhen last we left our hero he was learning from the blacksmith in the town of heroes. During training the blacksmith told Belin that recently a new smith was trying to make a name for himself in the town of heroes. The smith hadn't done anything heroic or honorable and yet managed to gain entrance. Belins trainer had a theory that involved him killing an unsuspecting hero and taking his entry. What's worse is that the smith was using all the money he made, to give a small army of drow a leg up while raiding innocent elf villages. The smith couldn't prove it but he'd seen and heard enough to be sure. Sadly no one would listen without proof. He asks Belin to gather some proof and bring it back so he may be kicked out of the town. He promises to teach Belin his best smithing secrets in return. \n\nExcited our hero goes out to rally the troops. Sadly he can't find the Cleric or the Dragonborn.(The players weren't at our session but he looked for their characters anyway lol) After discussing the story and such with the monk and rogue, they decided to help. Now we wait until night and sneak around his shop looking for clues. We come to an open window and look inside to see the smith talking to a drow. Telling him that he'll keep funding them and in return they'll keep sending him elvish artifacts, weapons, and armor. At this point the party is ready to go to the mayor and tell him. Then the unthinkable happens. Belin goes to sneak away with the other two and I roll a 1.... so yea. Now Belin stands up, hits his head on the open window, and breaks it. Now they are staring me dead in the face. The drow quickly flees and the smith challenges me to a fight. Belin declares that he's ready now and looks behind him to see his team leaving him in the dust. The evil smith responds with \"Are you dumb? It's a crime to fight in the city. Outside the gate at sunrise you die.\" We ask around a little and find out he's a good fighter and out of game find out he's a higher level then us. We discuss a plan. The rogue comes up with the best one. He's gonna dig a good sized hole outside and cover it up. He'll mark it so I can find it. When me and the evil smith fight my goal is gonna be to toss him in the hole. He'll get in there and be stuck. With no way out, we'll get the mayor and things will be right. \n\nNow here's where things went wrong. I had no idea but while I was listening in to the convo between the drow and smith, the rogue was hardcore checking out the smith's weapon. A silver shortsword with rubys and sapphires intergrated into it and a crest on the handle. Now he got it into his head that he should have such a fine weapon and a villian didn't need it. He was of course a halfling and a rogue so these things happen. So after we made the plan he decided to change it a bit. That night before sun up our rogue dug the hole but he filled the bottom with spikes. Some were sharp rocks and sticks, others were broken spears or spear tips. Either way he pulled no punches and put a ton. Sunrise rolls around and the evil smith comes out to meet Belin. The fight starts how you would expect. At first Belin tries to win by besting him. After several bad rolls I soon realized this wouldn't work. Not to stick to the plan. Belin charges the weakened smith and grabs him. Belin picks him up over his head and throws him hard enough to knock him out when he hits the ground (or so Belin thinks.) Now the smith is impaled and dies. Belin hadn't meant to kill him and starts to feel bad. Some good rolls by the rogue (and bad ones by me) end up convincing Belin that it's better this way and that Belin has saved some innoccents. Now is when things take a turn for the worst.\n\nA little background info. Our entire game the monk and Belin had several arguements and disagreements. So did his player and I. Most of it would be over a battle plan. The monks player would get mad if we didn't do his plan or idea. He would huff and puff and half the time leave the game. Either putting his character on follow mode or heading back to town. It became a problem and Belin called his monk out on him always ditching when they needed him. \n\nSo now here sits a wounded Belin looking into a spike pit. The monk decides that with Belin gone he can be leader. He also decides that he'll say that I murdered the smith and he stopped me. Looking like a hero for killing a friend to uphold justice. The monk's player decides that with Belin hurt and me rolling crap rolls all night, his best shot is now. He goes to attack and fails. Belin spins around and proceeds to whup him good. He yells out to the rogue and tells him to help. Offers him all of Belin's gear, money, and other goods. The rogue say's \"of course I'll help a friend\" and stabs the monk. Anyway, monk dies and gets tossed in pit too. Things are right in the world now. While Belin is beside himself over the betrayal, the rogue snatches the smith's sword and puts it on his belt.\n\nAs we walk into town all the people are noticing the sword and whispering. Turns out that was the best craft the smith ever had and showed it off like crazy. It also had his family crest on it. They knew it was his and he hadn't been back to town after leaving. We get to the smith and as soon as we go to talk to him the mayor shows up. He doesn't look happy. He shouts out \"EXPLAIN!!!\" At this time the rogue starts spinning a web of lies that sound pretty good and the mayor believes them. Belin of course can't stand by and let this happen. He puts a hand on the halflings shoulder, say's \"It's alright...\" and tells him the real story. Much to their surprise the mayor starts laughing. He thanks them for taking out the trash and helping keep his city good. He tells them that they've earned a reward but now they'll have to see this to the end and rid the elves of the drow raiding parties. We agree. The mayor tells the halfling to keep the sword as proof that he'll slay those who hurt others. Belin is given his shop and house. So that he may set up his own shop after learning the last secrets from the smith. He leaves and the rogue walks off happy. \n\nThe \"Secrets\" that I learned basically made it to where I would need one less success to smith or craft things. If it needs 3 success before 3 fails, I would already have 1 success. Pretty nifty little DM buff. Belin now has a shop to sell his goods, practice, and buy goods somewhat. Also the group now has a home in the Town of Heroes. No more Inns and no more carrying all of our loot. It's a decent house too because the evil smith wasn't hurting for gold. \n\nYet another PC died at the hands of Belin but this one chose me. Other two players were shocked to hear the story. ",

        "text": "Our tale begins in a small coastal town, Sea Keep, where a tiefling rogue and would be pirate Sylvan meets an elven sorcerer Garahel and a dragonborn warrior Draxan an odd group to be sure, some would have said they were destined for mediocrity and failure but fate had a different plan for them .  \n\nAt first their plan was to find work as mercenaries but Sylvan had a different idea, one day while at the docks Sylvan leaned into Garahel and said \"I'm going to take that ship\" pointing at a modest trade vessel.  Before Garahel could even utter a word Sylvan was already walking towards the ship, having been a sailor most of his life he knew how to make it look like he belonged there and met no opposition walking down the dock and onto the deck.\n\n  He made his way down into the hold and started rummaging through the cargo, nothing too valuable, fishing supplies and common spices.  While snooping a few crewmen came down into the hold laughing and drinking, caught off guard by his presence Sylvan managed to convince them he was a new deckhand ordered to inspect the cargo by the captain, the crewmen invited Sylvan to drink with them, which of course he accepted, after an hour or two of drinks and stories it became apparent to Sylvan that it was all too obvious to these three, who he came to know as Smitty, John and Michael, that his story was fabricated but nonetheless they seemed to genuinely enjoy his company. In a move of slightly intoxicated boldness Sylvan began to ask about the captain, in response he learned that he was not particularly well liked by the crew but neither was he hated. Sylvan in a tone that carried a mix of jest and grim seriousness offered, \"Perhaps it's time for a new captain.\" to which Smitty replied with a wink \"Aye, perhaps it is, be sure to visit us again before we set sail on the morrow.\" Sylvan stood and said with a smirk \"That I will friend.\" and departed the ship headed back to the tavern to speak with Garahel and Draxan about his plan, they agreed and spent the night planning their takeover and what to do when the ship was in their hands.\n\nOnce dawn rolled around it was time to put their plan into action, they made their way down to the docks to find the ship had already started to leave port, unwilling to give up they sprinted down the dock and leapt towards the moving ship, Sylvan and Garahel made the jump without issue but the hefty warrior barely caught a plank just above the water level, nearly losing his grip, the three climbed the up side of the vessel and onto the deck where they were greeted by a crew of bewildered sailors and an angry captain, a tiefling easily the twice the size of Sylvan, who drew his sword and shouted \"Who the fuck are you and what are you doing on my boat!\" to which Sylvan responded with possibly the biggest lie he had ever told, \"I am Dread Captain Sylvan scourge of the northern seas, I have come to take this ship now surrender or die!\" after which Smitty said \"Captain we are clearly outmatched, we are sailors not soldiers, we should lay down our arms and keep our lives.\" meanwhile Garahel and Draxan are looking on absolutely dumbfounded. This clearly had no effect on the captain but gave enough pause to the rest of the crew for Sylvan to challenge the Captain to a one on one duel, the winner keeps the ship the loser is taken prisoner, The captain confident in his ability agreed happily. The crew formed a circle around the two who took their positions at either side, after a short but brutal minute of flashing steel and scuffling Sylvan lay face down on the deck bleeding and unconscious, the last he heard was an order to take their weapons and throw them into the brig, Garahel and Draxon did not resist.",

        "text": "One problem with storytelling in modern settings--something I've heard lamented by GMs and authors alike--is the difficulty of maintaining tension when everyone and their dog is one phone call away from each other at all times. Found out some super-secret, urgent mystery that affects the future of the entire plot? Great, batch-text that shit and you're good to go. But, as we've discovered in our V:TM game, there are definitely tradeoffs to constantly relying on pocket technology, as well as loopholes to keep the drama flowing.\n\nSpecifically, two main situations keep coming up:\n\n1) Every time we fall in some body of water, our GM makes us roll to see if our phone died.\n\n2) Whenever our phones are dead, we can't even use landlines cause we don't know anybody's actual goddamn phone numbers.\n\nThe scene you're about to witness is just such an incident. It's a half-hour from sunrise and I, Tom, a Brujah of limited resources and patience, am stuck phone-less at the top of San Francisco, outside an Etherite's lab in the base of Sutro Tower. I'm low on blood, have a technical feeding-restriction (long story), and to top it off, I'm hauling around a staked Tremere elder wearing nothing but a hospital gown (also long story). I *could* crash in the Etherite's lab, but I've learned not to hang around the crazy death-ray wielding mage for too long (last time I did I lost an arm). With dawn approaching, my last-ditch plan is to somehow get ahold of NPC Theo Bell, who is the Justicar currently running the entire town while he tries to figure out why the hell everything keeps exploding (many times literally). He's wrested control of the ex-Prince's network and I'm hoping he can send a car to whisk me to safety.\n\nBut, of course, I don't know his phone number.

        "text": "The four of us sat around the table with *him* at the head of it. Hideo Anneki or what was left of him had fallen into our lap on this latest run. Nominally the CEO of Renraku, now reduced to drooling into his pudding cup. The final piece of the whole fraggin puzzle. \n\nJoe Steel, of all people, was the one who put the pieces together. \"Reminds me of Death-Ninja 6, revenge of the Shogun-Nazi,\" he said. Joe was always comparing things to the shitty movies we used to make, and he used to star in. Joe called the meeting, said his piece. Made a surprising amount of sense. Now the table is silent, save one brain-fried CEO babbling to himself trying to figure out how to get the last of the pudding snack out. There is one other sound, the light scraping of brass on fake wood as Joe rolls a single 9mm cartridge back and forth on the table. An apt symbol for the decision we grapple with.\n\nIt would be a shit ending, and as movie people, we hate shit endings. But it would be *an* ending, when just yesterday this whole mess seemed like a horror simsense stuck on loop, with us poor slots unable to jack out. \n\nJust a month ago we were making a movie, *The Infiltrator 7: This time Its WAR*. We were filming at the top of the Renraku Arcology, up where its still under construction. One day in the middle of a shoot, things suddenly went nuts. The Arcology's AI had apparently been plotting for weeks. Getting custom cyber put in all the security people, mind controlling them, making a small army of vicious drones. On one signal the place went under lockdown and they started rounding people up for hideous experiments. For over a week we fought our way from the 102nd floor to escape. Once we got out we found that the AI had started sending teams of its soldier and drones outside too, on mysterious errands. \n\nMost of these errands were gathering supplies the AI couldn't make in house. But we got a tip-off about a big one. Some sort of raid on a hospital. We hit them on their way out and stole their prize. The CEO of Renraku, brain fried but alive. His chart said he'd been like this for weeks in a private wing of Seattle General. He'd had some nasty run in with a weird type of Black ICE (security program). \n\nThe pieces fell into place. Joe remembered a conversation with a researcher we freed. \n\n\"The fastest way to kill the AI would be to deliver the killswitch. Only Anneki, the CEO has it. It is a certain pattern of thoughts in his brain that if loaded into the mainframe will first disconnect the software from the hardware, then start chopping the software into bits.\"\n\n\"So,\" Joe explained. This guy right here has a killswitch in his head that is supposed to snuff that AI. So the AI hacks his brain to try and kill him first right? I dunno. I think if the AI wanted him dead, he'd be dead. Certainly by now. Guy's a vegetable, but he's breathing. Botched attempt? Bullshit. Why? Because the AI sent its goons into the hospital and pulled him out *alive*. If it was a hit, he'd be dead. The AI needs him alive. I think its found a way to stop the killswitch before it finishes the job. \n\nRight now, the AI is tied to hardware. It can't leave its physical servers in the arcology. That means you don't need a killswitch to kill it, just the will to use enough explosives on some expensive computers. But if the first half of the killswitch runs, but not the second half, its free. It can get to the Matrix and just cruise the net as software. This sonnabitch right here is the AI's only ticket to freedom. \n\nThe news says the Army is about to try to breach the arcology and take it back, floor by floor. The AI can't hole up in there forever. Sooner or later the army will find his servers and reprogram him with some C-4. \n\nWe've got 3 options. \n\nIf we sit tight and hold Anneki, eventually the army will win. They'll free whatever people they can. That could take months though. In the mean time the AI is going to throw everything its got at us to get him back. Not to mention Renraku and the Cops. Everybody loses. We're fighting for our lives every day and every day more people inside the arcology are being experimented on, mind controlled and killed. By the time the Army has everything clear, there won't be anyone left. \n\nIf we go back in and try to deliver the killswitch when the AI isn't ready for it, it *might* work. It *might* chop up his code the way its supposed to. But maybe that black ICE fucked up the killswitch. Maybe it doesn't do the code-chopping anymore. Besides, if we die in there, we'll have given the AI exactly what it wants. On the other hand, if it works, this could all be over tomorrow; the AI could be dead, and most of the people still inside saved. It's risky, so fraggin risky.\n\nOption 3: We splatter this poor sonnabitches brains against *that* wall *right now*. We record it and deliver that recording to the AI and to Renraku. It will know that it can't win and it will negotiate a surrender with Renraku. People will be saved today, but who knows what sort of deal those corporate sleazeballs will make with it. It also means one of us will have to murder a man who can't even dress himself.\"\n\nAfter the long pause, Barry spoke up.\n\n\"You said once we were the best damn special effects crew you could ever ask for, so I've got an option 4. We fake it. We go back inside. fake an execution on camera, get the negotiation of surrender process rolling, and then sneak our way upstairs to one of the server rooms, jack in Anneki and deliver the killswitch while everyone is distracted.\"\n\nJoe's jaw drops. \"I know the place to do it! 4th floor, there's a balcony overhanging a terrace. We'll need an ultrathin bungee cord, some super-thin bloodpacks, one of them needs to be made up to be on his temple, no two of them for a through-and-through. Tommy, can you make me a muzzle brake adapter for my sidearm that will give me a full muzzle-flash and cycling without doing more than singeing this guy when I pull the trigger next to his head? God I LOVE being an *actor!*",

        "text": "So you want to know who I am? Well my name, I can’t give you. Just call me “The Commander”. As for who I am? I just… am. If you’re asking for my history, I can’t give it to you. There are only 3 creatures alive who know my story and I’m one of them. I’m waiting until those 2 are dead and my past will be worth a fortune.\n\nWell I suppose for some coin I could maybe go 5 years back to when I stumbled into the North Newland mountains. I didn’t intend to walk into the most dangerous part of the Newlands at the worst part of the year, I was kind of screwed over. That story will cost more though.\n\nSo here I am, out of food, no shelter, and I am literally freezing my balls off. Then this group of Gnomes and dogs show up and start yelling at me for information. Haha. I was about to die, there was no way I was yelling out anything but my name. \nThey chained me up and carried me to a cell. It was pretty hilarious because I was a giant compared to them all. While in a hard but surprisingly warm cell I was fed and treated quite well. But the instant I started to feel well, the Gnomes chained me up and forced me into the cold again.\n\nI was supposed to be gathering food I guess, but the mountains aren’t my thing. I was dying out there in chains looking for things I didn’t know how to find. After 3 days of gathering almost nothing I knew I had to think quick, or I would be dead.\n\nJust over a year ago I had stolen a ukulele from a wizard. I didn’t want it, I was actually reaching for a much more valuable item but missed. I don’t want to get into specifics, but after a lot of running and a lot of luck I was glad to get away with my life. Even though the ukulele felt like just a condolence prize, I couldn’t help but feel there was something special about this ukulele. I couldn’t explain it. I never played that ukulele but I kept it in a secure container in my bag since then.\n\nNow it was time to see if it would work. But I would need to get as many of these Gnomes together as possible.\n\n“Hahaha! Do you know who I am? I am the one and only prophet of Iron Maiden! The most powerful god to ever exist!”\n\nI went on like this. Trying to sound as important as possible. It wasn’t even that hard. I suddenly remembered a story I heard when I was younger about some sea monster coming to land to help the poor and sick or some shit. I just changed some names and made the monster into a god I made up on the spot. I was just lying for my life at that point.\n\nThey ate it up so quick. Before I knew it I had at least 40 of these Gnomes hanging on my every word. I would pause a lot to fabricate more of the story, and they thought I was doing it for dramatic tension or something. It was almost hard to keep from laughing as I tested the limits of as many ridiculous things they'd believe.  \n\nEventually they actually brought me into a giant hall with almost all of their village population in that one room. I thought I was going to some killing room, and here I am in the room where they eat, with the whole village staring at me. I was convinced I was dead at this point. But then get this! They ask me to prove I am some prophet of this religion I just made up out of panic and folklore. I don’t think anything has ever gone so well for me in my life. I just had to seal the deal.\n\nI pull out this enchanted ukulele I stole from that wizard and start playing. I didn’t know how to play a ukulele when I did this. That said, I somehow played the best song ever… for everyone at the same time. My best guess is the ukulele was enchanted to play the “perfect” song to everyone in earshot, but I’ll never know. When the song was finished, the enchantment was released from the instrument. Then I just held a regular ukulele.The best part though is that the enchantment actually taught me how to play the instrument flawlessly. \n\nThe Gnomes pretty much worshiped me after that. I taught them how to make musical instruments, and did my best to make up fake facts about this religion I had pulled out of my ass. The hardest part was keeping the facts straight. I almost got caught a few times.\n\nAs soon as I could leave I did. I really wanted to just cut all ties, but the Gnomes almost violently insisted I take at least one of them with me. I picked the smallest and dumbest looking one of them all… but I soon found he was the 4th strongest villager who, and was actually fairly intelligent. \n\nI thought he would catch on and kill me in months. I tried to escape a few times but he always found me. Hell, 2 of the times he found me Killroy actually saved my life.\n\nI live for me. I have never known a friend and Killroy is no exception. He entertains me, and makes surviving this insane land much easier. It’s true he’s grown on me, and I’m sure he would give his life for me... but I can't say I would not do the same for him. Now lemme tell you about the doppelgangers... and that fucking cleric...\n\n**TO BE CONTINUED**\n\n*(D&amp;D 2nd Edition)*",

        "text": "My name is Killroy. I am a Gnome Barbarian who lived in the North Shores of the Newland for over a century. I was the head forager of my small mountain village, who survived by hunting and scavenging the barren mountainsides. We managed to live very well even with our small numbers and death around every hour.\n\nI suppose my life was uneventful until just 5 years ago. Too mundane to go into much detail, but I feel obligated to give a brief summary of my life before I begin the story I’d really like to tell.  My days while outside my village were spent taking the war dogs out to collect food and resources. My time inside the village was spent learning to craft weapons for hunting. Looking back it was a soul-sucking cycle of days just trying to survive. Surviving was really all there was to do. \n\nThere were only a few events in my village’s history that were really significant enough to point out. When I was 60, the village was invaded by an army of Kobolds looking to survive an exceptionally long winter. They knew better to attack us, but for them it was fight or die. They should’ve just died. The battle lasted less than a day. We routed over 120 Kobolds, only suffering 8 deaths. From their bones I crafted a battle axe that I keep on me at all times. I’d go into the others, but at this point I’m just rambling.\n\nEnough about my village life, for my true journey began one fateful day while scavenging for food as I did every day. My group found a Half-Elf who identified himself as “The Commander”. He was freezing, wet, and obviously hadn’t eaten for days.  Despite his thick layers of assorted cloaks he was frozen to the soul. If we had left him alone for even another hour, the world might be cursed with his death. We carried The Commander back to our village as procedure dictated. Not that we really wanted him alive at the time but the idea was always that a slave could work for much less than a villager. And after all, if they could not work, no meat is bad meat. There is really not much those who choose the Barbarian life won’t do to stay alive. Even if we Gnomes do seem more intelligent than the normal Barbarian stereotype, food is still food. It’s just the mentality you need to survive in the extreme mountain conditions.\n\nIt was the 4th day after The Commander had started to come with us foraging. He had been given the time and nourishment to return to full strength and nothing more before chaining him up and leading him out into the wild. He was terrible to say the least. The amount of food he brought back wasn’t even enough to feed himself. To my village… he had chosen his own fate.\n\nIt was my job on the 5th day after his first trip outside to inform The Commander of his fate. He had not earned his meals and was to be used… as a meal. He was given time to make peace with his gods before the execution. Nothing nasty. We wanted to eat but we had no interest in torture of any kind. Kill, cook, and eat. The end. When I gave the news to The Commander he almost seemed happy. Hauntingly happy even. He began laughing and talking of his god who he called “Iron Maiden”.\n\nConfused, I asked The Commander why he would be so happy to die this way in front of his god. Was his god a fan of sacrifice? Cannibalism? Gnomes? But then he spoke the words that set off the series of events that determined my life’s purpose. “I am a prophet. I have been sent by my god Iron Maiden to spread their music to everyone in the world.” Still just as confused as before, I asked “Why does this make you happy? If you are truly a prophet of your god for that purpose, you must be sorry to see your journey end here. Surely this is not the ending a god would will to their own prophet?”\n\nThe Commander stopped laughing. He looked me dead in the eye and started to tell me a story. I don’t know what came over me but I humored the Half-Elf. I sat down and began listening for no other reason than curiosity. His story told of the origin of Iron Maiden, and the heroic deeds the god had accomplished to help suffering creatures. Before I knew it, at least 2 score members of my village were huddled around The Commander’s cell, entranced by his glorious tale. By the end, I’m not sure we all believed him, but we were all convinced we needed to give him a chance to prove his word.\n\nThe Commander was supposed to be moved to the execution chamber, but this time was different. We decided to move the prisoner into the mess hall just before lunch. We surrounded the Half-Elf with 30 of our strongest villagers and gave The Commander his belongings back.\n\nOur leader, who was present to hear The Commander’s story sat at his usual seat high above the other villagers and spoke. “Commander, you have claimed to be a prophet for a just and powerful god. If you tell the truth, then prove it. You have before you everything you were captured with. If you can prove to us your power is real, and your word is law, then we will spare your life.”\n\nThe Commander stood motionless and silent for what seemed like an eternity contemplating the ultimatum our leader had given him. Finally, The Commander’s voice shattered the empty air with just 3 words. \n\n“So be it…”\n\nThe Commander reached into his backpack on the floor in front of him and pulled out a ukulele. The ukulele glowed a magnificent yet soft blue. No one in the room could take their eyes off of the god-like instrument that was held before us. It’s as if the creator of the universe was holding the meaning of life in front of our eyes. Without another word, the Half-Elf began to play and sing a song.\n\n “A song” seems insulting to what actually happened. This was a song unlike any other. A song that could unite the world. Truly the best song ever played. A song so metal, no other song could ever possibly compare. It was then we all realized this creature standing before us truly was a prophet. The one true prophet to the most powerful god ever known. It was as if all the gods in existence were channeling themselves through his fingers and lungs.\n\nThe song ended on an exciting note in which the blue light exploded from the ukulele and enveloped the room with a magical aura before fading out to nothing. No Gnome dared break the silence after the song at first, but we could only hold back our tears of joy and applause for too long. Soon the entire mess hall was filled with so much noise you could have carried it out in buckets. \n\nWe were a group of villagers living day-to-day. Death behind every corner. Any sign of weakness leading to banishment or war. It was at this time the entire village realized that the life they had lived to this point was a waste of time. We needed music. We needed metal. We needed Iron Maiden. \n\nThe Commander stayed for several more weeks, telling us all about Iron Maiden, the benefits of worshiping the god, and the rituals for worshiping the god correctly. The Half-Elf taught us how to construct and play instruments to appease the god of metal. The village had to run on short rations to feed the prophet and keep him comfortable, but we didn’t mind. Until the day came where the winter finally broke, and it became safe to travel once more. \n\nThe entire village was heartbroken to see the prophet go. We had stocked him up with all the gold and food we had to offer, but we still didn’t feel it was enough to thank The Commander for what he had done for us. Just before The Commander left, the village, our leader stepped in front of the escort  group who had taken him to the edge of our territory. \n\n“Oh prophet of Iron Maiden. We have supplied you with as many provisions, and as much coin as we can, but it’s not enough. We cannot let the prophet of such a powerful god wander unprotected. As powerful as you might be, even gods pale in comparison to the forces of nature. Please, allow one of us to follow you as a protector. Just one of us can ensure your survival in even the most brutal terrain.”\n\nThe Commander contemplated for a few moments, then answered. “Who would it be then? I appreciate your kind offer, but you must know a prophet such as myself will only take the best with me. I cannot afford dead weight on my spiritual journey.” \n\nOur leader frowned and lowered his head. “Unfortunately we cannot give you our best fighters. We suffer the constant threat of the monsters who live in the…”\n\nThe Commander stopped him with a raise of his hand and a shake of his head. “Don’t waste your breath, I get it. Thank you for your hospitality, but I should be on my way.” The Commander turned and began to walk away.\n\n“No, wait!” Cried out leader. “We cannot give you out best warriors, but with a power such as yours I doubt you need warriors. I’m offering to send one of our best foragers with you. If one of them had been with you when you had entered the mountains you’d have made it through without any trouble. It will make traveling much easier.”\n\nThe Commander again paused. It had become known as a habit of his. The entire escort group held their breath waiting for a response. Our leader again broke the silence with one more plea. “Please prophet of Iron Maiden. If we were to let you leave without any protection, we would never forgive ourselves”\n\n“Fine.” The Commander finally spoke. “Him.” He was pointing directly at me, “If anyone is going to come with me it’s gotta be him. Agreed?”\n\nTo this day I don’t know why he picked me. Was it because I was the one who was supposed to deliver him to his execution? The first one to listen to his tale? This is a question I will be ponderng for a while, but I can’t imagine an answer that would diminish the wonder of my journey. I was sent off with The Commander with 2 war dogs I raised since pups. I’ve been traveling with The Commander ever since.\n\nHe is my prophet and I am his arm. I protect him wherever he goes. I believe every action he makes is in the best interest of us, and Iron Maiden. I have slaughtered those who stood in the way of The Commander’s will, and will continue to do so, because that is what I live for now.\n\nThe Commander, myself, and our 2 war dogs. We’ve worked when a job was profitable, and stole when it wasn’t. The Commander’s one goal is to stay alive to spread Iron Maiden’s will. I am alive to make sure he stays alive. For 5 years this arrangement worked out. But then… the pillar… and the fucking cleric… and this town… I wish we could just go back.\n\n**TO BE CONTINUED**\n\n*(D&amp;D 2nd Edition)*\n\n",

        "text": "I've been DMing for a group of people for a couple of years or so, but out last session was such a masterpiece of emergent narrative that I feel it would be a sin *not* to write it down for posterity.\n\n**The Players:**\n\n* Sir Alek Herleif, male human paladin of Heironeous.  Young and brash, but dedicated to justice and valor.  Perhaps a little too happy-go-lucky and addicted to adrenaline for his own good.  The *de facto* leader of the party, and the most talkative.\n\n* Jerem, male human fighter/cleric of Heironeous.  An old, grizzled veteran disillusioned with religion and his life on the battlefield and aimlessly wandering the world seeking a purpose.  Often plays straight man to Alek.\n\n* Rogu, female half-orc barbarian.  Likes to kill things.  Good at killing things.  One of these days I'm going to have to beat some characterization into her.\n\n* Broomy (AKA \"Broomhead\"), male human sorcerer.  A 60-year-old man who is constantly forgetting who he is and what he's doing.  Searching the world to find his grandson, whose father (his son) has died.  Unfortunately, he doesn't exactly remember quite what his grandson looks like.\n\n* Shrief, male elf sorcerer/ranger.  Not much character background yet, but that's okay (the player is new to the group, but hopefully will be back for more).\n\nThe players are all 6th level.\n\n**The Setting:**\n\nThe campaign technically takes place in the Age of Worms adventure path, though there are frequent diversions for sidequests, both published and homebrewed by me.  The PCs have just broken a siege on a small military outpost, and are marching into a nearby swamp to track down prisoners abducted by the besieging lizardfolk.  None of the PCs have very good survival skills, so they're dependent on following the tracks of the lizardfolk to find the lair.  This is important, because they'll likely be unable to retrace their steps and find any of the locations in the swamp on a return trip.  \n\n**The Story:**\n\nAs they traipse through the marsh, they see a curious sight: in a small, relatively dry island stands the statue of a human bard, petrified in a resolute pose.  As they approach, they find three more statues, unlucky adventurers petrified still in their bedrolls.  Searching their packs, they find a variety of mundane loot, including a single scroll of *stone to flesh*.  \n\nThe Statues Formerly Known as Humanoids comprise:\n\n* Krothunk the Insatiable, half-orc fighter/cleric of Hextor.  Adorned with multiple scars, sigils, and holy symbols.  Alek strongly considers unpetrifying him solely so he can beat him to a pulp.\n\n* Eladrin Anduino, an elf wizard.  Though, since he forgot to pack his spellbook, he's more of an elf commoner at the moment.\n\n* Rogan the Red, dwarf fighter.  Enjoys bars, fights, and bar fights.\n\n* \"Sir\" Jeffrey \"Bert\" Berthington, human bard/rogue and adventurer extraordinaire.\n\nIt is important to note that I had no idea which NPC they would unpetrify, and was well-prepared to engage the PCs as any of them.\n\nAfter some discussion, they elect to cast it on the bard, figuring that he would be the most likely to talk.  If only they knew how right they were.\n\nThe first thing out of Bert's mouth as he is unpetrified is a terribly girlish scream, as he expresses his dismay to have let the PCs sneak up on him on his watch (from his point of view, he was keeping watch -- rather ineffectively -- while his party slept, and suddenly he's surrounded by the PCs).  Regaining his composure, he introduces himself as Sir Jeffrey Berthington, though he graciously deigns the PCs to call him \"Sir Bert\".  The paladin, himself a minor noble, takes a keen interest in Bert's nobility, and asks him some questions about his family and his land.  Bert rather uncomfortably admits that technically, he's not a lord yet, though he will be soon! he exclaims, because he is engaged to be married to a fair lady of noble standing!  Well, he plans to be engaged to a fair lady of noble standing.  He's going to court her, for sure.  Also maybe she's already engaged to someone else.  But that's okay! proclaims Sir Bert, because he is going to become a famous adventurer and woo her with his tales of valor!\n\nAt this point, the PCs are already looking into ways to turn Bert back into stone.\n\nThe PCs ask Bert some more questions (\"What was your group doing adventuring here?\" \"We were performing heroic deeds of might and magic!  Of sword and sorcery!  Also I owe Krothunk a favor.  Okay, not really a favor, more like a bunch of money.  And also I tried to run out on my debt last time, and maybe Krothunk caught me and now he makes me follow him around so I won't run.  But it was for a good reason!  My mam was very sick, and we didn't have any money for the medicine!  I had to borrow the money!\" \"Bert, shut up.\").\n\nBert asks the PCs some questions (\"So, I trust you have slain the horrible creatures that so terribly incapacitated me and my compatriots?  Truly, it must have been an epic battle of titanic proportions!\" \"Well, no, actually we just found you guys like this.\" \"What?!  But what if the beasts return?  Can you at least remove the curse upon my companions?\" \"Well, no.  We were only able to unpetrify you because your elf wizard over there --\" \"Ah, yes!  Eladrin Anduino, elven archmage!  Prepared for anything!\" \"Not prepared enough to pack more than one scroll of *flesh to stone*, apparently.\").\n\nAt this point, the PCs huddle up and decide what to do with Bert.  They eventually settle on pointing him in the direction of the nearest village (several days of travel through the dangerous swamp), handing him his possessions (an ornate rapier, some quill pens, some inkwells, several sheafs of parchment, and a half-written epic poem about Rogan the Red (\"Wow!  Did you guys write this?!\" \"No Bert, you did.\")), and wishing him good luck.\n\nBert, understandably, takes exception to this -- he knows he won't last 20 minutes out of the PCs sight.  The PCs, however, are insistent -- they're going on a dangerous quest to raid a lizardfolk lair, and it's no place for one such as Bert.\n\n\"But wait!\" exclaims Bert, \"I can help!\" *collective PC sigh*  \n\"Surely you will need a bard of great talent to chronicle your exploits for eternity!\"  \n\"No, Bert.  Go home.\"  \n\"But I have lots of useful skills! I, uh,\" Bert looks around sheepishly, \"I can open locks and stuff.  I may have broken into my lady's manor before to borrow some items that I could pawn.  But it's okay, I really needed the money, and besides, it's not really stealing, because when I'm her lord then it'll all be my stuff anyway.  Also, I left IOUs.\"\n\nFor once, however, Bert has gotten the PCs' attention.  You might have noticed from their party roster that they're missing a rogue, and suddenly they all start to see Bert not just as a tool, but also as a tool.\n\nHeartened by their new acquisition, the PCs pack up and leave, with Bert in tow singing ballads of their greatness.\n\nOver the course of the next day of travel, Bert becomes an unofficial party mascot/designated punching bag.  The PCs get in a tussle with a couple of giant crocodiles, and Bert, overcoming his initial terror, throws down his backpack, rummages around, and throws a small vial at one of the crocs.  \"A-ha!  Nyarleaf oil!  The deadliest poison *known to man*!  Watch, even now the inky blackness spreads across their hide!\"  And indeed, the PCs are slightly impressed to see that one of the crocodiles is indeed speckled with black stains.  The PCs finish the job, though Bert suddenly becomes disheartened upon searching his pack (\"It was ink!  I threw an inkwell at it!\").\n\nThe next day, Bert impresses them all when he inadvertently activates an arcane sigil through a random piece of knowledge (bardic knowledge doing work), opening a passageway to a small dungeon that Bert claims was built by an ancient archmage solely for the purpose of providing loot for adventurers (\"For as long as there have been adventurers, there has been loot!  But there have always been adventurers.  So where does the loot come from?  The answer is Demetrius the Bored!  An ancient archmage who wandered the world, creating treasure for adventurers to find!).\n\nThe party is suddenly split.  They're on a time-critical mission -- they're tracking prisoners that are liable to be executed.  Do they have time for a sidequest?  Jerem is adamant that they focus on the mission -- \"Loot is not important right now!  Lives are at stake!\"  Rogu and Broomy, not caring about the prisoners, are bored enough to wander into any random dungeon in their way.  Shrief is undecided.  Alek is torn -- of course the hostages are the top priority.  But there could be a great fortune in there, and it's unlikely they'll be able to retrace their steps to find this location in the future.  He decides to explore the dungeon, promising Jerem that they won't be in there for more than 10 minutes.\n\nBackground: this is a preconstructed dungeon I took out of a book somewhere.  It's essentially a single hallway that spirals inwards, littered with a variety of traps that have already been visibly triggered (open pit traps, scything blades sticking out into the hallway, etc.).  At the center of the spiral, there is a large chest and the charred corpse of an unlucky rogue who managed to get all the way to the end before succumbing to a *flame strike* trap on the chest.  However, the chest is on a pressure plate, and if too much weight is removed from it, it will reset *all of the traps in the dungeon*, trapping the PCs in the center.\n\nThe PCs make their way through the dungeon, at first with caution but then with increasing nonchalance as they realize all the traps are harmless (barring one instance where Rogu attempted to perform a standing jump over a pit trap, failed, fell 80 feet, and started bleeding out, causing flashbacks to [a similar situation much earlier in the campaign](http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/1op6dn/i_just_had_to_make_a_check_against_getting/ccu7eis)).  They continually nudge Bert to lead the way, being the only one who can (ostensibly) find traps; however, he repeatedly proves his incompetence, apparently having no clue how to find a trap without intentionally trying to activate it.  Broomy follows behind Bert, prodding him along with the butt of his longspear and exhorting him to \"keep searching!\"  (\"Stop poking me!  You're just like my grandpa!  'Bert, go cook dinner!' 'Bert, go outside for once!' 'Bert, stop reading your stupid books!' 'Bert, go meet some girls!' \")\n\nNear the end of the dungeon, Jerem becomes upset with the party's treatment of Bert and their singleminded pursuit of \"loot\" and heads backwards to the dungeon entrance, eventually deciding to wait near a pit trap halfway through.  The rest of the party works their way to the center of the spiral, where they find the burnt corpse of a rogue slumped over a treasure chest.  With some prodding, Bert enters the room, not sure what to expect.  \n\nAlek: \"Bert, unlock the chest!\"  \n\"But--\"  \n\"No buts, Bert!  You said you could open locks, now do it!\"  \n\"I have opened locks before!  Oftentimes with keys!\"\n\nBert fumbles around with the chest for a while, using the masterwork thieves' tools graciously provided by the deceased rogue at his feet.  The party, meanwhile, watches from around the corner, at a safe distance.  After some fiddling, Bert realizes that the chest is already unlocked.  Like a good rogue, he decides to take all the credit.\n\n\"Guys.  Guys!  I did it!  I unlocked the chest!\" Bert is almost jumping for joy.  \n\"Well done, lad,\" says Alek, \"You did good.  Now, go open the chest.\"  \n\"Open it?  But...but...that burnt body.  Is it safe?\"  \n\"You'll be fine.  Go open it.\"  \n\"Are you sure?  Maybe one of you guys could--\"  \n\"Just open the chest, Bert!\"  \n\nBert swallows hard.  \"Sure.  I trust you guys.\"\n\nBert hesitatingly tiptoes back over  to the chest.  The party watches from around the corner.  Wiping the sweat from his palms, he opens the lid of the chest.\n\nDid I mention that the *flame strike* trap is the only one that automatically resets itself?\n\nHe gets the briefest look at the contents -- thousands of gold worth of diamonds, platinum, silver -- before the *flame strike* hits him.  9d6 damage, straight up.  Poor 4th level Bert didn't stand a chance.  He's killed instantly by the blast.\n\nThe change in atmosphere is immediate.  \"Bert!\" Alek shouts.  He rushes to his side, checks for a pulse.  Nothing.  Rogu and Shrief are dismayed.  \"Burt!  I loved you!\" wails Broomy.  Alek is inconsolable.  Some of the party begins to shovel the loot from the chest into their bags -- a hollow victory.  Their precious loot comes to a total of about 8,000 gp.  There is a loud click, and a mechanical whirring runs through the walls as the traps begin to reset themselves.  \"Alek?  What's going on?\" shouts Jerem as he watches scythe traps fold back into the walls.\n\n\"Bert's dead.\"\n\n\"I killed him.\"\n\nThe enormity of his actions has begun to set in.  What has he done?  What happened to his oath to protect those weaker than him?\n\nFingers are pointed.  Suddenly everyone had always loved Bert, the paragon of goodness.  Alek takes it hardest -- already, he can feel his connection to the divine weakening.  He's broken his vows, the source of his power is fading.  Everyone seems to be blaming him -- after all, he was the one who told Bert to open the chest.  No one mentions that they had all stood by and watched.  Only Jerem is somewhat blameless for the debacle, having wanted nothing to do with any of this in the first place.\n\nAlek protests feebly -- \"It wasn't all my fault.  You guys didn't say anything.\"  His claims fall on deaf ears.  It seems that when you claim to speak for the gods, you're held to a higher standard than your peers.\n\nTalk of atonement and repentance is bandied about.  They still have a time-critical mission, and they won't be able to drag Bert back to civilization for a *raise dead*.  They elect to detach one of Bert's fingers, saving it for a *Resurrection* spell that would cost 11,000 gp or so.  A net financial loss for them, but a paltry sum to cleanse their souls.  Alek promises that he will resurrect Bert and swear an oath to serve him, to fulfill his dream of becoming an adventurer.\n\nThey trudge out of the dungeon in silence, Alek in front, activating the traps as though he can't feel the pain.",

        "text": "Hey guys, I've been reading a lot of amazing stories here and have felt inspired to try and resurrect my close friends' D&amp;D sessions which had sort of fallen apart when 1 stopped playing and 3 moved to other parts of the world. People are sort of back together now and we're trying to get playing again after 2 years, this means we are going over the details of our party to straighten things out. It may be worth noting I am the only one experienced at playing many (computer) RPG's and my friends are just getting into the fantasy scene\n\nThe original party consisted of...\n\n* K, the human paladin who described his appearance as \"Aryan\" and is complete with an Aura of Racial Superiority\n\n* P, the human wizard inspired by Khaleesi, her favorite character from Game of Thrones. Shoots a lot of magic missiles and not much else, has a talking short sword for a quest hook\n\n* M, the elvish ranger, because Legolas. Gets really excited about being Legolas and is disappointed by pace of game, stops coming to meets and drops out\n\n* Myself, my first tabletop character. Everyone else stuck to the 3.5e player's handbook whereas I am a tryhard and created a SECOND archer but needed to be unique, ergo, Human zen archer adopted by mysterious disappearing elves after his family was killed and was found wandering the forest. Zero personality basically.\n\n* A, a stupider half-orc barbarian version of himself blessed with the hilarity of critical failures\n\nThings have changed a bit, I like to think my perspective has switched now that I've read a lot about how other people play and I'm no longer a min-maxer muppet and just want to be creative and have fun messing with our DM who takes this really seriously, it's his first time too. So M's character basically left the party to pursue some anomalous lead, my character will leave to look for him. I introduced my friends to the 100 questions to flesh out your RPG character so that we can actually roleplay this time\n\n* K is now a foil of Superman, though upon pressing him for more details just now he revealed he's actually playing him as \"a funny guy who is so picture perfect but really imperfect because he has no idea what he's doing and makes terrible choices by running head first and trying too heard\", it's about this time I realize he's not Superman, he's roleplaying a drunk A.\n\n* P is exactly the same as before :|\n\n* A has prayed to the gods of luck and by that I mean nothing has changed and I will cast Enlarge Person on him so that Godzilla-sized critical failures can be had\n\n* I've written a new character, Kendra, a Dwarven cleric of Pelor whose small village was ransacked by an Underdark raid. She's subsequently racist of dark-skinned folk, wracked with survivor's guilt and deals with it by drinking heavily, is very sexually innocent (dwarves reach maturity around 40yrs), and is obsessed with surviving to continue her crusade against darkness (personal-based) and the undead (religion-based). Studies everything she can about survival, is a foil for Batman.\n\nLet me say that again in case you missed it or haven't read the Dark Knight Rises. My character is a female foil for Batman, K is a male foil for Superman.\n\nI hope this doesn't awaken something in me...",

        "text": "\nFirst, let me tell you of what came before. As part of STALKER's \"main\" quests, you encounter a man being held up by three bandits on entering a new zone. They're demanding he give up all his possessions and cash, while he screams out he doesn't have any.\n\nThis is where I come in- the Marked One. I keep my flank close to a sprawling line of cars, and load up some rounds into my double-barrel, listening to the increasingly frustrated pleas of the man, hoping they'll cover the sound of my approach. I settle my shoulder in against an open driver-side door, and open up with the first shot- bandit down. \n\nMoving the iron sights over to the next, I crack off another shot before he can kill the man I'm saving- then hear a few rapid shots from the dude in distress as he puts a few bullets through the skull of the third.\n\nI do a quick check of the bodies, pulling some ammo off their belts and doing a quick check of the leader's sub-machine gun to see if it's condition is any good- turns out to be barely better than a dud, so I leave it on the ground.\n\nAs soon as I approach the saved man, a comm broadcast interrupts his thanks- a man named Bes, apparently in control of a local group, is asking for assistance on a bandit ambush. The survivor vouches for this \"Bes\", claims he's part of his group, and next second we're off.\n\nWe head to a long-dead junkyard, the rusting carcasses of buses, helicopters, and tanks letting out a collective metallic groan, grating the ears. A mustachioed gunman approaches, introduces himself- explains this junkyard used to be the bandits' territory, but his group liberated it. They expect a counterattack soon, so an ambush has been set up- and I readily volunteer, drawing out my trusty Fort-15 sidearm and moving for one of the desiccated buses.\n\nThe bandits come quick, and in numbers- but with our combined firepower, they go down quick. I recognize their leader- a trader a few towns over had a job to kill the ugly bastard. I pocket his trademark ring as proof of the deed, and go over to Bes.\n\nWe have a quick conversation, wherein he tells me how he came to the Zone, this disastrous hell-hole. Back before he was in this life, his brother got murdered- so he paid a visits to the two that did it, three bullets for each. When the cops came, he shot one before diving out of the third story window.\n\nSounds like paradise compared to the Zone.\n\nI take off after that- there's an abandoned Institute nearby that I need to look into. Got a contact that might be able to help me locate Strelock, the slippery shit.\n\nWhen I get there it's another hard-pressed battle- beginning to almost welcome the fighting, now. \n\nBut, as with all things in the Zone, the blood is shed and the survivor walks- loaded down with a new weapon or two, but I'm still living.\n\nMakin' my way back to town so I can tell that trader his rival's dead when I hear gunshots- coming from the junkyard. Something feels off in the air- and it's not just the radiation this time. I stash what I can into the trunk of an old Volkswagen and sprint in the direction of the shooting.\n\nBodies already litter the area by the time I arrive. Lot of casualties- mostly on our side. Two bandits left from the surprise hit, firing off rounds between the links of the fence. I slip into the junkyard, running hard until I can't catch my breath anymore, then ducking down behind a twisted car, the shape impossible to tell after the years. I pop up here and there, the kick of my pistol seeming hollow without the scream confirming a hit.\n\nThat catches their attention, though, and I can hear shots peppering off the metal around me. So I change cover, moving at a quick crouch towards the rest of the defending company- and that's when I see it.\n\nBes, the beautiful bastard, laying face-up. Eyes open to watch the rad-storms without blinking, finger locked down on the trigger of a spent rifle.\n\nI wonder briefly if they even knew who they already took down. Probably not- the scavengers in the Zone come and go too fast for names to gain much reputation.\n\nI hear the howl of a mutated pig being sucked into an anomaly- spots in the Zone where physics and everything we know about the world decide to fuck off and savage anything that comes within their maw. Bloody chunks fly out from the radius of the anomaly- it's one of the Whirligig ones. Whimsical name for the worst kind of death. \n\nBefore I can convince myself of how much this goes against my core philosophy- staying alive- I'm already past the chain link fence, cracking off aimless shots from my pistol to get their attention as I shove my way through the brambles and scrubs of the nearby woods. \n\nShortly after I can hear their same movements, like an echo- a dark smile twists my lips. I can feel a pulse deep within my flesh, one unnervingly alien but familiar, in that I've felt it a hundred times before fleeing in the opposite direction. \n\nThis time, I run right for it- then throw myself prone, snuggling against roots. I hear their boots move past, the rasping of their struggled breath, the heavy clunks of their weapons hitting on their leather armoring. \n\nThen, screams- screams that will haunt my mind until the day I die alone in the worst wastes of the Zone, screams that will always have a core of vengeful pleasure.\n\nBloody chunks careen through the woods. Half a heart lands in front of my face- a thick splatter of gore comes down a second later.\n\nYou're avenged, Bes. Hope wherever you went's better than here. ",

In this battered fortress, the kobolds (Pale blue goblins) make their residence. To keep the population of the fragile kobolds high, there are clan-designated clerics, who imbibe glistening oil when they come of age in order to commune with the earth. Rizzax is one such cleric. He was born as a member of the Darkeye clan, and was chosen, despite his lack of vision. \n\nAfter several years of healing, the effects of the glistening oil began to take hold of Rizzax's mind, a voice began to speak to him, it told him the secrets of his world, and that he would help return the phyrexians to Dominaria. All Rizzax could do was blindly obey. However, as soon as his insanity began to overwhelm him, another piercing, yet calming voice entered his mind.\n\n\"Fear not, youngling, I am The Oracle, and there is much for you to do. My world has been decimated by the being known 1000 Faces, and he comes for your home soon. Accept my blessing and you may yet save Dominaria.\"\n\nThe voices in his head had broken him, he no longer knew what to do, but then the first voice told him to accept the offer. Before Rizzax could speak, a blue light washed over him, the next thing he could \"see\" were tall grasses with five imposing figures surrounding him, a massive beast of a man, a swirl of elements, a crystalline giant, a cloaked figure, and a normal looking man with a metal arm.\n\n\"Great, now a goblin's here,\" said the large, dirty human, \"As if things couldn't get worse.\"\nQuickly, the being made of fire and water began to probe the little kobold and began spouting out numbers and characteristics, and was shortly joined by the metal-armed man.\n\nThe giant and the cloaked figure remained silent for several minutes, before the giant said, \"Blue light lady too?\"\nRizzax, still shooken up, simply nodded and began to dust himself off. They obviously were meant to travel together, and they all must have homes to save.\n\nAfter a long while of arguing between the metal-armed man and the shaman, the group decided to head towards the nearby river to set up a small camp.\n\n(Nothing incredibly fancy for this chapter, as it was our intro session, where we all got used to RPing as our characters, but I will update more as well continue our games, I should get them out every Sunday if possible)\n\nEDIT: Formatting, yo",

        "text": "I DM a game using a system my friend and I built called Jamgot, and it's space themed, mostly. They were struggling to leave the planet, and there was a LOT of deliberation about how to leave the planet (It's semi realistic, so the planet they were on didn't have a bus that could just fly them away) and they had decided to raid a military base halfway across the planet. To get there, they were going to steal a HeliQuad from a fellow up on a hill. While they were all on their way to the fellow's house, a car came driving down the road. Due to horrible decision making by everyone in the group, they were all wanted for murder, arson, theft of military equipment and so on, so they were quite wary of the car.\n\nThey all decided to hide in the nearby tree line and wait for it to pass, when suddenly they decided they wanted to flag the car down instead. They asked the party cyborg to flag down the car, and, being raised by robots and not understanding the meaning of \"flag down\", he hit the car with his force glove, a device that uses kinetic energy to push things really hard. The car flipped over, slid sideways into a automechanics shop, exploded, and then exploded the gas canisters within the shop as well. \n\nGiving a thumbs up to the group, the assassin of the group got so angry he decided to snipe the cyborg's thumb off. Taking aim, he completely blows off the finger of the cyborg, dealing quite a bit of damage. The cyborg, not having any of that, decides to retaliate by murdering his party member. He runs into the tree line where the cat assassin resided and used his \"Extendo-Arm 9000\" to reach up into the tree, and cut at him with his chainsword. He catches the assassin quite squarely, taking down half his health in one cut. The assassin, fearing for his life decides to hop from tree to tree, doing his best to escape the cyborg.\n\nThe cyborg kept up with him at the bottom of the trees, until the assassin decided to use a hero dice to fly away. He sprouts his wings and starts to fly away. Not to be outdone, the cyborg hits the ground with his force glove, launching himself 40 feet into the air, spinning with his chainsword out, and arm extended. As he passes the cat, he cuts a wing off, killing him.\n\nNow, killing someone in Jamgot is usually the end of the line; there are ways to come back to life but they are few and far between. As the cat begins to fall out the sky I look through his list of anything he had, as this was only our fourth session, and he WAS quite a pack rat. He had a cybernetic heart implant which was broken at the time, and having him roll to see it saves him, he rolls a 1. Alright, critical failure, but he's already dead. So I look into his bag, and what did he pick up from that naval base two games ago? A WORLD ENDING NANO BOMB. Well, that wasn't supposed to activate here, but a roll's a roll. I give him a second chance to roll, since that roll didn't really correlate with the cybernetic heart, and because I'm a merciful DM who didn't want his party to kill each other. Luckily, he passed this time, and as he hits the ground, the bomb activates, and he is injected with a regentive serum that brings him back to life.\n\nAlright, nano bomb was activated, but at least everyone is alive, right? Well, our cyborg is still 40 feet in the air and that fall would kill him. Instead, he lands on the nano bomb, which  is shock absorbent, to avoid people destroying it as it consumes a planet (He still takes a bit of damage though, he's at 3 points of health left) . Alright, out of the frying pan and into the fire. Problem is, because the nano bomb was manually activated, it has a *very* small amount of protection ability, as it protects the activator, and so the cat assassin believes that he has full control over it. None of them really knew what it did, and now he thinks he has Garra's sand from Naruto. Of course, what does he do now that he has a second chance at life? Revenge of course!\n\nSo now the cat and the cyborg are at it again, and this time the cat has the upper hand as each time an act of aggression is shown towards the cat the nano bomb forms up and knocks the aggressor away. Luckily for him he still has a sniper, so one well placed shot later and the cyborg is killed. And even though there might have been a way to save him, what does the cat assassin/pack rat do? Completely dismantle the cyborg, ripping organics from tech to keep all of the technology pieces for sale later.\n\nAnd that's the story of how my game completely killed an entire planet in 2 in game days since meeting up.",

        "text": "Our campaign has us as paranormal investigators in a gaslight-era city. Like turn-of-the-century Ghostbusters, but with more stabbing. This provides a lot of opportunities for interesting setups and NPCs, but since you're generally not allowed to loot a client's house, we weren't getting much in the way of random treasure. After a while our salaries could no longer make up the difference, and the monsters were beginning to outclass us.\n\nOne session, one of our three-person party couldn't make it. Since we were between cases anyway, the remaining player and I (Bard and Urban Ranger, respectively) decided to see what we could do to pick up some extra funds. After putting our heads together, we remembered a hook from an earlier case: Our all-male party had needed to bullshit their way into a women's society so we could talk to a person of interest. We accomplished this by having the bard somehow convince the women that he was a travelling cosmetics salesman, since he'd happened to have a bottle of perfume on him at the time. The bluff went over so well that we couldn't get out of there without a promise to return later for a demonstration. \n\nSo that's exactly what we decided we would do.\n\nIt had occurred to us that, as adventurers, we had access to resources not available to the average citizen. We rushed to the black magic market in the poor part of town and started buying up alchemical items, particularly the cheap non-combat ones. Then we bought a ton of little boxes and empty vials, and paint and ribbons to decorate them. We worked out new names for all the products and decided how we would sell them, and for how much. After working overnight we had repackaged everything and had it looking professional, and after getting ourselves cleaned up we were ready for our big moment.\n\nWe put a bowtie on my wolfhound so he could be our mascot. Before we began our presentation I used Gather Information to get a read on the crowd and particulars on a few members, then passed that info to the bard to help with the actual sales pitch. The items we were selling were commonplace for adventurers, but these upper-class ladies had never seen anything like them. We re-branded anti-toxin as Toxiclense, a sure-fire hangover cure, and sold them in bags of five. We drizzled trail bars with frosting and called them Moxie Cakes, the ultimate diet aid.  Anti-trait grease became Felixis Inner Beauty Lotion, capable of hiding any blemish. The list went on, all in dainty little packages at the biggest mark-up we thought we could get away with. \n\nWe rolled well. The ladies ate the products up. I don't know what formula the DM used to determine what we sold, but we earned an absurd amount of money, something like twelve thousand gold (Nothing to sneeze at, at 7th level), and we hadn't even brought that much to sell. It was way more than we'd been expecting, and we were seeing dollar signs. \n\nWe had arranged for a recurring NPC to be in attendance, someone who recognized what we were selling and who had the money to help us get off the ground if our idea worked. She was suitably impressed, and we worked out a deal where she would handle the running of the company and we would get a regular cut, in exchange for us being on the lookout for new product ideas and markets. The bard and I were named CFO and CEO and ran off to spend our money and get back to the office before the party wizard figured out what we were up to.\n\nWe never told him.\n\nTL;DR: Being ghostbusters wasn't paying enough, so we became cosmetics tycoons.\n",

        "text": "I played a Warforged Fighter called Clank in a D&amp;D 5e campaign (technically during the playtest, but whatever). At one point, the party was attacked by halfings hiding in some barrels we were shipping. This, combined with the troll the halfings paid in mutton to shake up any travelers crossing the bridge, was a decent challenge.\n\nOur party's monk was a kinda weeaboo martial artist who always ran along rooftops instead of the streets because the player thought it was really cool. It was, but it got a bit tiring after a while. Also the player played the character as a serious, no-nonsense character to the point that it was kinda silly, even at our table. By contrast, I'm playing my Warforged as kind-but-oblivious, nice-person-who-everyone-likes, gentle giant character, so I had a lot of fun with my character confusing the monk for an organ grinder with a monkey for a pet. Clank would always ask about when he'll get to see the monkey, the monk would always say, \"No, monk, not monkey!\" and Clank would reply, \"Exactly! When are you going to show him to us! I bet he's adorable in his little costume!\"\n\nAnyway, I digress. So this monk runs up to the troll, shouts something about honor and combat and such, uses his flurry of blows to attack twice, and misses both. The troll then backhands the monk across the jaw for a critical hit, dropping him to half his hit points in one attack.\n\nSo Clank walks up to the troll and says, \"Why are you doing this, Mister Troll?\"\n\nThe troll says \"If Oi give the li'l people shoiny things, they give me mutton.\"\n\nAnd Clank thinks for a moment and then says \"Those halfings could sneak away and not pay you, you know. They're naturals at sneaking coz they're so small. Now, if you join us, I'll pay you in mutton - better mutton, coz I can cook - and I'm a massive metal man so I couldn't sneak away even if I wanted do. Sound good?\"\n\nDM says, \"Sure, roll a Charisma Check for Persuasion.\"\n\nI think now would be a good time to mention that the DM had kept forgetting, over the course of at least five or six sessions, that just because someone is a tanky Fighter with a nigh-unhittable AC doesn't automatically mean that they made Charisma their dump stat. When I wanted Clank to be a nice guy who people naturally liked, I made sure his character sheet reflected that. His highest stat was Strength at a 20, but his next-highest was his 17 Charisma. On top of that, he was trained in Persuasion.\n\nSo I roll the d20. I get a 23.\n\nKeep in mind that, in D&amp;D 5th Edition, the DC for breaking chains through pure strength is a 20.\n\nThe DM stares at the die. Then he flips furiously through his session notes. Looks at the dice again, then back at his notes. *Pulls out the campaign guide*, then looks back at his notes. Then he puts them all away and says with an air of both frustration and begrudging amusement: \"The troll agrees to join your party. Everyone take a five-minute break\".",

        "text": "I played a Warforged Fighter called Clank in a D&amp;D 5e Campaign. At one point, the party was attacked by halfings hiding in some barrels we were shipping. This, combined with the troll the halfings paid in mutton to shake up any travelers crossing the bridge, was a decent challenge.\n\nOur party's monk was a kinda weeaboo martial artist who always ran along rooftops instead of the streets because the player thought it was really cool. It was, but it got a bit tiring after a while. Also the player played the character as a serious, no-nonsense character to the point that it was kinda silly, even at our table. By contrast, I'm playing my Warforged as kind-but-oblivious, nice person whom everyone likes, gentle giant character, so I had a lot of fun with my character confusing the monk for an organ grinder with a monkey for a pet. Clank would always ask about when he'll get to see the monkey, the monk would always say, \"No, monk, not monkey!\" and Clank would reply, \"Exactly! When are you going to show him to us! I bet he's adorable in his little costume!\"\n\nAnyway, I digress. So this monk runs up to the troll, shouts something about honor and combat and such, uses his flurry of blows to attack twice, and misses both. The troll then backhands the monk across the jaw for a critical hit, dropping him to half his hit points in one attack.\n\nSo Clank walks up to the troll and says, \"Those halfings could sneak away and not pay you, you know. They're naturals at sneaking coz they're so small. Now, if you join us, I'll pay you in mutton - better mutton, coz I can cook - and I'm a massive metal man so I can't sneak away if I wanted do. Sound good?\"\n\nDM says, \"Sure, rolls a Charisma Check for Persuasion.\"\n\nI think now would be a good time to mention that the DM had kept forgetting, over the course of at least five or six sessions, that when I wanted Clank to be a nice guy who people naturally liked, I statted him out to reflect that. His highest stat was Strength, but his next-highest was Charisma. On top of that, he was trained in Persuasion.\n\nSo I roll the d20. I get a 24.\n\nKeep in mind that, in D&amp;D 5th Edition, the DC for breaking chains through pure strength is a 20.\n\nThe DM stared at the dice. Then he flipped furiously through his session notes. Looks at the dice again, then back at his notes. Then he puts them away and says with an air of both frustration and begrudging amusement: \"The troll agrees to join your party in your fight both against the halflings and any later adventures.\"",

        "text": "Our campaign has us as paranormal investigators in a gaslight-era city. Like turn-of-the-century Ghostbusters, but with more stabbing. This provides a lot of opportunities for interesting setups and NPCs, but since you're generally not allowed to loot a client's house, we weren't getting much in the way of random treasure. After a while our salaries could no longer make up the difference, and the monsters were beginning to outclass us.\n\nOne session, one of our three-person party couldn't make it. Since we were between cases anyway, the remaining player and I (Bard and Urban Ranger, respectively) decided to see what we could do to pick up some extra funds. After putting our heads together, we remembered a hook from an earlier case: Our all-male party had needed to bullshit their way into a women's society so we could talk to a person of interest. We accomplished this by having the bard somehow convince the women that he was a travelling cosmetics salesman, since he'd happened to have a bottle of perfume on him at the time. The bluff went over so well that we couldn't get out of there without a promise to return later for a demonstration. \n\nSo that's exactly what we decided we would do.\n\nIt had occurred to us that, as adventurers, we had access to resources not available to the average citizen. We rushed to the black magic market in the poor part of town and started buying up alchemical items, particularly the cheap non-combat ones. Then we bought a ton of little boxes and empty vials, and paint and ribbons to decorate them. We worked out new names for all the products and decided how we would sell them, and for how much. After working overnight we had repackaged everything and had it looking professional, and after getting ourselves cleaned up we were ready for our big moment.\n\nWe put a bowtie on my wolfhound so he could be our mascot. Before we began our presentation I used Gather Information to get a read on the crowd and particulars on a few members, then passed that info to the bard to help with the actual sales pitch. The items we were selling were commonplace for adventurers, but these upper-class ladies had never seen anything like them. We re-branded anti-toxin as Toxiclense, a sure-fire hangover cure, and sold them in bags of five. We drizzled trail bars with frosting and called them Moxie Cakes, the ultimate diet aid.  Anti-trait grease became Felixis Inner Beauty Lotion, capable of hiding any blemish. The list went on, all in dainty little packages at the biggest mark-up we thought we could get away with. \n\nWe rolled well. The ladies ate the products up. I don't know what formula the DM used to determine what we sold, but we earned an absurd amount of money, something like twelve thousand gold (Nothing to sneeze at, at 7th level), and we hadn't even brought that much to sell. It was way more than we'd been expecting, and we were seeing dollar signs. \n\nWe had arranged for a recurring NPC to be in attendance, someone who recognized what we were selling and who had the money to help us get off the ground if our idea worked. She was suitably impressed, and we worked out a deal where she would handle the running of the company and we would get a regular cut, in exchange for us being on the lookout for new product ideas and markets. The bard and I were named CFO and CEO and ran off to spend our money and get back to the office before the party wizard figured out what we were up to.\n\nWe never told him.\n\nTL;DR: Being ghostbusters wasn't paying enough, so we became cosmetics tycoons.\n",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2ushb4/tale_of_the_one_adventure_of_the_late_mau_lingtau/",
        "text": "{This is the (usually) daily journal of Mau Ling'Tau, Novice thief in my friend's campaign. She worshiped Deneir, and would chronicle her life daily. While I only wrote the journal of our party's adventures until she died in a tragic failed attempt at Use Magic Device with a wand of fireball the fight after this journal ends, in her possessions, i devoted 5lbs to the most recent journal of her life, which cost 1/2 what a spell book did, and was 1/4 full, at campaigns start) \n\n\n\nOn this day, soon after I arrived in Loudwater, I hired on with Lord Heinrich to attempt to find his son (Heinrich Jr.). Heinrich is, by any stretch of a sane imagination, an asshole but the pay seems like it’ll be worth dealing with the stuffed shirt.\nAlso, found out the son of some rich elven lord, and a couple other people were taken, the night I arrived in town. \nThere are a few other women that I’ll be working with in this endeavor. There is this tavern wench named Inga, who seems like she will be good to have on my side in a fight. Another of the chicks is this backwoods hick named Sylvanna.  The two other women I will be working with are both, well... not quite human. One has silver hair, and the other has gold hair. Salith is this crazy chick who doesn’t have any weapons, armor, or really much of anything, besides the clothes she is wearing. Don’t know what good she will be, but hey, if she dies, it’s no skin off my back. I think the last woman, Yldara, is some kind of mage or cleric. She doesn’t seem to be all that preachy, though, so I assume she is a mage of some form. She looks pretty weak, too, but hell, it’s good to have some magic at your back. Oh, and she’s some form of fae, and flies. That ought to give her an edge up in any melees. Nice trick if you can do it, I guess. \n\nWe also ran in to this guy who is called the “Gauntlet of the North.” He said if we do a good job for Lord Heinrich in returning his son, he will have another job for us, which he strongly implied would pay even better than the asshole. .\n\nOn the trail of the kidnapped people, we were ambushed by 8 orcs – 2 of them seemed to be their leaders. After the fight was over, we looted 15gp, 2 masterwork great axes/chain shirts/composite longbows (+2), 6 bucklers with the symbol of the Black Rock clan of orcs, 6 falchions, and 6 studded leather.\n\nWe tracked them to a cave and went in. There were orcs inside, who came running out when I set off a trip wire. Next time keep your damn eyes open! The orcs attacked, kicking our asses, then strangely showed mercy and let us go. Luckily, they didn’t know we were following them. Even luckier for us, I’m sure, is the fact that their leader seemed to be in a big hurry, like he didn’t even want to deal with us. We took our leave and left, but circled back, close enough to see that there was a large party of prisoners being led from the cave. We tried to follow the prisoners, but were spotted pretty easily, and they sent some outriders to harry us long enough for the rest of the party to get away. There were, I think, about 10 prisoners being led away. Not sure of this son of Heinrich is with them, nor am I sure about the elf kid that got taken or any of the others. Seems likely, though.\n\nWe went back to the cave and found half a dozen orcs in this big cavern. We got them all, pretty quickly, but made enough noise that four more orcs, and one of those stronger, smarter orcs heard us, and attacked us. From this group, we looted 1gp, 66 sp, 4 studded leather, 4 falchions, 6 studded leather great axes, and one very nice chainshirt, a very nice great sword, and a very nice Composite longbow. I couldn’t even draw the bow. We also picked up a wand that Yldara says will allow her to cast some minor cure spells, and two potions, neither of which we could identify.\nAt this point, we went back to the camp we had established when they let us go the first time, and as it was starting to rain pretty heavy, we built a couple of comfy lean-tos to keep us dry, and got a fire going, to roast some of the wild game that country bumpkin snagged. She isn’t very cosmopolitan, but she sure is someone to keep on your good side in the woods!\n\nThe next exciting thing that happened was this gorgeous guy with angel’s wings, and swords for arms flew into camp, and healed that Yldara chick (who, I have to say, is KICK ASS in a fight. Denier  grant me her fighting prowess, that bitch can hit harder than I can with my daggers. And she is so fluid as she moves, she just seems to dance around when people try and hit her. She moves so fast, I can’t even follow her movements!) Anyway, she had gotten pretty badly hurt in the last fight – even with me giving her two of my health potions, she was pretty messed up. And this winged guy swoops down outta the sky, and touches her, and she practically sprang up, fully healed. I heard this voice in my head, and it asked me what one desire was in my deepest heart. Some of these women I’m with are flat-out gorgeous, and the first thought that popped into my head was that I wished I was better looking. He smiled at me, when I thought that, but that’s all I saw him doing. I wonder if he will ever come back, and grant me that wish. Oh, by the way, the sword guy was apparently a high-end servant of the ever-suffering Ilmater. Glad I worship Deneir, not that guy. I’d hate to have a god that always wanted me to suffer. \nPretty soon after the sword guy left, we heard two sets of heavy footsteps. We all tried to hide, and it’s a good thing, too. Two ogres had apparently seen our campfire, and were gunna kill us. Luckily, Sylvanna was around, cause with her trusty bow she fucked them up royal. WOW can she use that bow. And she is scary-good with that longsword and shortsword she carries. Anyways, I got a couple of gems off the ogres, look to be nice ones, too! [600gp each] \n\nWhen we got back to the cave, and ran in to escape the hail that was coming down, there were another four orcs in that first room. I put one of them down myself. From them, we got 4 studded leather, and 2 each of kinda beat up falcions, and some solid, and wicked, looking great axes. We also got 56 sp. It was starting to get really loud outside, too, and it felt like the air was pulling at us.\nAlmost as soon as that fight was over, five more orcs came running in. They didn’t put up much of a fight, either, and from them, we got 4 more studded leather, and two more each of the falchions and great axes. We also got a very nice chain shirt, a great sword, and another of those pretty bows that I can’t draw, and finally, 4gp.  \nAfter that fight was over, us having killed them, Salith tossed their bodies into the tornado raging just outside the cave. Inga had to toss her a rope, though, to keep her from being sucked away. It was kinda scary for a minute, what with Inga being pulled by the tornado, and Salith holding on to the rope. The rest of us grabbed onto the rope, and pulled, too. Not sure how much I helped, but it all worked out. She wasn’t sucked out. \n\nWith the storm still raging outside, and trying to suck anyone who got too close to the mouth of the cave out into the storm, there was only one more room we could safely enter. When we got there, there were three more orcs. Two of them knew we were coming, but the third was blind and stupid. I was able to get up close to him, and take him out, while the rest of the girls took out the ones that knew we were there. They were pretty rich orcs, because they each had 15silvers, and studded leather armor. 2 had those nasty looking great axes, and one wielded a falchion. In the corner of the room, we found a wadded up sheet of parchment (I took the sheet to have more to write on for this journal, in case it’s a while before I can buy more) that was written on Orcish. I was able to make most of it out, but the writing was entirely too… pretty to be an orcs hand. I think it was written by an elf, actually. \nBy the time we were ready to move on, the storm outside had abated enough that we could safely head down the last tunnel from the main chamber. I’m really glad Salith has that glowing rock, but that don’t mean I like being down in the dark like that. Gives me the shivers, all that rock over our heads. And without that rock, I cant see my nose, much less my hand in from of my face. \nAnyways, this tunnel was a lot longer than the others, and by the time we got to the chamber at the end, we couldn’t really even hear the storm. Whether that meant it had abated, or we were just too far underground, I don’t know. It was calm when we eventually made it back to the surface. \nWhen we entered that chamber, there was one orc, all pissed off and yelling at the other four orcs in the room. I guess he was their sergeant, or whatever. Anyways, we walk in, me being all sneaky, but Salith sure wasn’t being sneaky! The sergeant orc spins around, and charges us. A couple of arrows from Sylvanna, and he didn’t even get the chance to hurt any of us. Three more of those orcs died before they even knew what hit them. The last one, though, threw down his arms, and surrendered to us. Heh. Bet that would make you surrender, seeing your sergeant and 3 of your buddies killed before any of you could react. We found another sheet of parchment, this one had a map, and a location. The writing on the map said “bring the prisoners here” in orcish, with what I think is the same elven hand. I grabbed that sheet of parchment, too. I don’t plan on using that one, though. We also got another 51 silvers, 6 gold, and left 4 more studded leather armors, 2 great axes, and 2 falcions. The sergeant had a set of the really nice looking chain shirt, \ngreatsword, and another bow. \n\nOn our way out of the cave, we discussed what to do, and where to go. Its pretty obvious, now, that Asshole Junior was in that group of people that we tried to follow. We eventually decided to try and head cross country, and try and catch up with that party. There are a couple of rivers to cross on the way, though, according to that map. \n\nWell, the first river wasn’t much of a problem. Pretty small. Actually, not much bigger than a creek. The next day, we ran into a party of hunters, and talked to them. Sylvanna seemed to get along pretty well with them, and they gave us directions to a halfing village a day or two away that has a bridge to cross that second river.\n\nThe next day was NOT a good one for us. We started the day with an attack. These ghouls attacked us as we were breaking camp. I didn’t do anything in this fight, except get paralyzed by this nasty bite. Salith was nice enough to carry me off, though, and that kept me from being chewed on. Inga wasn’t so lucky. She got froze, too, and then one of them just started gnawing on her. Yldara, though, kicked their asses with some sorta spell, and then healed us all up. All told, we only got 22 silvers out of them. \nLater in the day, we got attacked by twelve skeletons. That was a nasty fight and I don’t remember much of it, nor of the next fight we got into. THAT fight was a nasty one. 3 forest trolls, and Ill die a happy woman if I never have to fight another one of those. I don’t even want to think about that fight. We all came out of that fight pretty beat up. We did, however, get a good deal of loot out of them.  They had 54gp and 12 gems [80gp \nEach ], a beautiful lyre[MW], a really sturdy looking [MW]tower shield, 3 potions [cure mod, cure light, hide from animals{rob thinks}], a scroll tube [6 scrolls, 5 arcane {1expeditious retreat, 1disguise self, 1mount, 2 see invisibility, 2 spider climb} 1divine{2}], and a wand of daylight.\n",

It was rather peaceful, until the rock-man asked, “Where are we going?”\n\nThe dwarf kept his pace at the front of the party.\n\n“North Town.”\n\n“Where is that?”\n\n“North.”\n\n*GM: Jarrod, roll a meta knowledge check.*\n\n*Jarrod: What?*\n\n*GM: Just roll it.*\n\n*Jarrod: Ok, I got--*\n\n*GM:* **You, the player, are fully aware that there is no such place as North Town. Your character has never been to, nor heard of, any place called North Town.**\n\nThe small metal construct spoke up, “Is everyone else actually okay with this little guy leading us? I think he--”\n\nThe swamp ruptured, the water taking form and knocking the dwarf off of his feet.\n\nAn Elemental moved through the water swiftly, faster than we could see.\n\n*Me: And how fast is that?*\n\n*Topher: Well, technically they have infinite movement speed through connected water.*\n\n*Me: You-... ah…* **Really!?**\n\n*Topher: Yeah, that might need some fixing.*\n\n*Me:* **MIGHT.**\n\nThe whale was the first to react. Drawing his waraxe, he swung it mightily…\n...and hit the ground.\nNext was the small metal golem, who began to pray. Suddenly, the whale’s axe went ablaze, burning white hot with the power of the gods.\nA magical bolt flew from the dwarf’s fingers, then dissipated as it hit the liquid surface.\nThe whale missed again.\n\n*GM: Seriously guys? This is the one with LOW dodge.*\n\n*Topher: The only person that can hit is Mega Rat, and he just has tinder bombs. The only person that can do damage is Sir Peldrin, and he’s a whale with -1 to hit.*\n\n*Me: Don’t worry guys, I got this.*\n\n*Topher: How?*\n\n*Me: I’m working on that part.*\n\nNot knowing what to do, I hid myself behind a nearby tree. I recalled the stories Mother had told me, the songs that she sang.\n\nElementals were fierce beasts, but the ones formed from water were the worst. They were nimble but sturdy, held together by a frame. I peered from behind the tree, watching as the others swung wildly, missing the creature over and over again.\n\nI saw it. The frame gave the creature a sturdy skeleton, but also housed something: The core. I could see it glimmer through the water that flowed so effortlessly to dodge the weapons being thrown at it.\n\nI scurried up behind the elemental, and reached inside.\n\n*GM: You what?*\n\n*Me: I attempt to grab the core and rip it out.*\n\n*GM: That… I… Ok, roll a to-hit.*\n\n*Me: 28.*\n\n*GM: You reach inside the elemental and feel the core. Roll a strength to* **attempt** *to detach it from the frame.*\n\n*Me: Crit! Added to the next… that’s fifty-nine!*\n\nI gathered all of my strength and gave a mighty pull, hearing the *snap* of the core detaching from the frame as I removed my hand.\n\nHolding up the marble-sized gem to the light, I heard the water and frame collapse next to me. After a moment, I opened my waterskin and put it in.\n\n“This is adequate.”",

If you don't like origin stories and prefer the hilarious kind, wait for part 2. Part 2 will tell of the ridiculous feats that he pulls off and will essentially be re-writes of the previous posts.\n\n***Forward***\n\nI need to make something clear.\n\nThis is not a story. At least, not the kind of story you’d expect to find in a book or other literature. This is a retelling of the adventures of a character in a tabletop RPG.\nThe reason I’m even writing this is because of the great experiences I’ve had with this character, and that I think someone out there might enjoy it.\n\nThe background of this story is that I and a handful of friends have been working on our own tabletop RPG for a little over two years now, basing it on the idea of being able to do what you want. Magic users can use swords. Rangers can be adept at unarmed combat.\n\nWe’ve been playtesting it every Saturday, finding weak points or abilities that are just plain broken and trying to fix them.\n\nBlocks of conversations that are italicised indicate conversations we have out-of-game: rule discussion, rolls made, etc. Some of these conversations are vital to the tale and tend to capture some of the humor.\n\nI apologize. I tried to keep chapter 1 short, but it’s more of a set up than the game itself. If you don’t care much for backstory, it’s skippable.\n\nIf you want a story, go read a book. I’m not stopping you.\nIf you want to hear about the rat that slayed a dragon, then you’re in the right place.\n \n\n***Prologue***\n\n*Me: So I think I know what I want to play.*\n\n*GM: What’s that?*\n\n*Me: A thief. No damage, just sneaking around and stealing things. I’ll even stay out of the party’s stuff.*\n\n*GM: Okay.*\n\n*Me: I’m going to be a Ratkin.*\n\n*GM: Okay. You know mousekin get more DEX, better for stealth.*\n\n*Me: I’m going to be an* **aquatic** *Ratkin.*\n\n*GM: What’s with all of these aquatic races!?*\n\n*Me: Look, I played a shark because--*\n\n*GM: There are* **FOUR** *of you gill-guffs and there are no real water parts in this campaign!*\n\n*Me: I’m going to be an aquatic Ratkin.*\n\n*GM: (sigh) Roll your stats.*\n\n\n \n***Chapter One***\n\n***Origins***\n\nEver since I was born, I knew I was special. Mother always told me so. She said, “You were born of a great adventurer, his blood courses through you.”\n\nMost mothers lie, but not mine.\n\nThe power was there. By three weeks I could swim faster than her, by five I was racing past the Zralocka (we always called them the shark folk). I loved it, the freedom that came with the speed. Mother named me Gnaw, but she would always call me “Mega Rat.” It was a child’s name, one that I did not outgrow.\n\nBut I did not belong.\n\nMy father was an outsider. A surface dweller, one of the despised that seduced a lovely young mermaid into his dirty paws. That’s what they told me. But Mother never talked about him that way. She told me he was a fine gentleman, one that swept her off her feet with his charm and romance.\n\nMother loved me, but she wasn’t around for long. Hardly a year after I was born, she left for the seaweed fields and never came back. The others chased me, jeering and taunting, telling me she had been eaten by the shark folk. I hid in the Deep for four years, surviving on the smaller fish I could find. I began gathering clay, learning to shape and mold it into beautiful sculptures. I made dolphins, flounders, even a crab. But not Mother. Never her. Mother was too beautiful for the craft.\n\nThe Deep became too much for me to bear. Mixing some clay, I changed myself. No longer a furry, dirty rat, I sculpted myself a new face. The face of the common. The face of a whale.\n\nMy first day in the central city, no one really noticed me. It was nice, the closest form of acceptance I’d find here. That was when something hit me.\n\n“My apologies sir, I didn’t see you there.”\n\nA whale had blindsided me. A whale with wings.\n\nI just floated, unable to think of a reply.\n\n“Still in shock, eh? Let me buy you some kelp for your troubles. My name is Captain Skywhale,” he said as he began to swim for the kelpery, “What’s yours?”\n\n“M-M-Mega Rat.”\n\nCaptain Skywhale looked at me again.\n\n“Well… uh… to each their own.”\n\nThis was the beginning of an amazing friendship.\n\nSkywhale and I worked together on many missions, though I never went to the surface. He regaled me with stories of the surface dwellers, how strange they looked with their pink skin and freakishly long arms. I never had the heart to tell him that I was born a rat.\n\nTwo years later, he brought me a banner.\n\n“I had this made for you. It has your name embroidered into it.”\n\n“Uh… thanks.”\n\n“Mega, I’m leaving today.”\n\n“Where to?”\n\n“The surface. I expect I won’t return.”\n\n“Oh. So this is goodbye then.”\n\n“I’ve been tasked with aiding the war against the Recosans. Our prince has been spotted fighting for the cause, and the king would prefer he stay alive.”\n\n“Take me with you.”\n\nSo we left. I had been practicing breathing the surface air, and I was ready to experience the upper world.\n \n\n***Chapter 2***\n\n***Mega Rat no more.***\n\nCaptain Skywhale soared swiftly above the swamp. Perched on his shoulders, I felt--\n\n*GM: Wait what?*\n\n*Me: Yeah, I’m riding him.*\n\n*GM: He’s a character, not a mount.*\n\n*Me (to Topher): Skywhale, you can carry me, right?*\n\n*Topher: What’s your storage value?*\n\n*Me: With my items… roughly under 100?*\n\n*Topher: Yeah, I can carry him.*\n\n*GM: In what, your hands?*\n\nPeering from inside of his massive backpack, I felt the air rush past me. I’d be cold if I weren’t covered in blue clay, but the disguise kept me warm, warmer than it had in the water.\n\nWe made a hard landing into the middle of the fray, arrows flying everywhere and reptiles swarming the place. A gigantic violet wall was raised in the distance, hundreds of meters tall.\n\nMusic filled the swamp, a light melody punctuated by steel on steel.\n\n“Mega, isn’t that…”\n\nI followed Skywhale’s gaze.\n\n“It’s him. That’s the prince.”\n\nThe Prince Whalvis--\n\n*Me: Really? Whalvis?*\n\n*Rassmussen: Yeah. My name is Whalvis Musikale.*\n\n*Me: You named yourself Elvis Musical.*\n\n*Rassmussen: No, it’s based off of the roots in a lang--*\n\n*Party (in unison): You named yourself Elvis Musical.*\n\nThe Prince was in the center of the action, violently beating his lute. Even though he was royalty, I found the image of a whale strumming a lute absolutely hilarious. His music seemed to strengthen the resolve of the soldiers, but the reptiles had the upper hand. Skywhale set a look of determination upon his face.\n\n“This is goodbye.”\n\nThen he ran. He ran into the battle and tackled the prince, hoisting him into the air with his massive wings.\n\nThat was the last I ever saw of Captain Skywhale.\n\nI ran from the combat, hoping to avoid the fate of the soldiers. I ran straight as I heard screams call out from behind me, until I found the wall.\n\nIt was huge. Even through my days in the ocean, I had never seen something so large. It was translucent, seemingly a giant sheet of amethyst. Embedded within it were large gems, some larger than me. Being four feet tall, that meant a lot.\n\nForgetting about everything but the jewels in front of me, I set my hands to a gem my size and began to pry.\n\n*GM: You realize that this gem is as large as you are, right?*\n\n*Me: All the more reason to pull it out.*\n\n*GM: And it’s embedded in a crystal wall?*\n\n*Me: I am a rat thief. This is what my existence has lead up to. This is my moment.*\n\n*GM: Fine, roll a strength check… wait, what is your strength?*\n\n*Me: One.*\n\n*GM: (scoffs) Yeah, good luck.*\n\nHard as I pried, the gem would not come free. After an hour, I gave up. I would have to come back for it.\n\nI turned to see an empty swamp. Well, somewhat empty. A gigantic reptile was throwing trees around while his troops tried to calm him down.\n\n“WHERE ARE THEY.”\n\n“S-sir, you killed them all. We won.”\n\nThis reptile was different from the others. Larger.\n\n“COME AND FIGHT ME YOU SCALY BASTARDS!”\n\nA tree flew twenty meters into the swamp, landing with a distant thud.\n\nSomething rumble beneath me.\n\nRising from the ground, a large whale--\n\n*GM: WHAT’S WITH ALL THESE AQUATIC RACES.*\n\n--blinked in the sunlight and smiled at me.\n\n“Brother! It’s refreshing to see another whale on the surface! How fares--\n\nA tree splintered as it hit the crystal wall above us.\n\n“We should go,” I said quickly.\n\nAs we made our way away from the freakishly tall lizard-man, three creatures burst from the ground. \n\n*GM: You know what. I don’t even care any more. I don’t care that half of the party is aquatic and the other half is subterranean. And that some people are both.*\n\nThe first was a large humanoid, his skin comprised of plated rock. The next out of the tunnel was a small construct, barely a meter high. The last to leave the hole was a stocky dwarf.\n\nThe three looked at us for a moment, then the construct spoke.\n\n“Hey… uh… wanna join up?”\n\nI looked at the whale, and he looked at me. The glance lasted only a moment. We replied in unison, “Sure.”\n\nThe dwarf looked at me speculatively. “Why is that rat wearing face paint?”\n\nThe whale burst in at the comment, “You will not insult us. I and my friend have agreed to help, and you will respect us and our kind for even considering the offer.\"\n\n*Me: Wait, Dan, you're the only one that failed against my disguise?*\n\n*Dan: Yup.*\n\n*Me: Whale bros for life.*\n\nThe dwarf backed up. “Woah, woah, okay bud, sorry I even said anything. C’mon, let’s go.”\n\nI don’t know why, but that’s when it hit me.\n\nMy only friend had abandoned me.\n\nI had new friends, here in this new and strange world, but I barely knew them.\n\nI hardly knew what a friend was.\n\nI ripped the banner from my chest, revealing a strip of brown fur.\n\n“I am Mega Rat no longer.”",

        "text": "A little set up for the game.  \n\nMonsters are real.  The Federal government has a Perpetual Unearthly Forces Fund (PUFF) that pays bounties on monsters killed.  It is very secret.  \n\nOur group of professional monster hunters is bad at diplomacy.  It’s odd when you get down to it because several of us are quite skilled at it.  Sometimes though, the dice are bloodthirsty.  I myself am the group’s best talker, with high presence and persuasion.  I’ve flubbed every conversational roll in the evening and accidentally executed a prisoner when I rolled a critical hit on damage when I wanted to shoot him in the foot.  \n\nThanks to our sanguine dice we found ourselves on ATVs making our way back up a mountain at breakneck speed to save a village full of friendly orcs from being massacred by a team of mercenaries.  \n\nAs we come up the trail, a figure steps out and holds his hand up to tell us to stop.  We recognize his outfit as one of the aforementioned mercenaries, and dispense with diplomacy altogether.  Our wizard (with all of two spells) takes a snap shot with a pistol as he drives by.  Amazingly, he hits the guy in the shoulder! (Negatives because he sucks at driving, negatives because he sucks at shooting).  \n\nNow, we expect lots of things when we shoot someone.  Usually it is “fall over and bleed” but we have encountered some tough things in our relatively short careers as professional monster hunters.  However, we did not expect the guy to let out a bestial cry of rage and rip his flak vest off and begin to transform into a werewolf.  The wizard (wisely) drives faster, putting some distance between seven feet of claws, teeth and muscle and his squishy self.  \n\nAs he clears the werewolf, however, he comes under small arms fire from the mercenaries with the werewolf.  Intending to cast one of his two spells, Light, in order to see the mercenaries our wizard attempts to cast it on a rock from his pocket.  \n\nHe successfully casts “Light Rock.”  Meaning he flubbed the spell to light the rock he could then throw.  He did succeed in making his ATV glow brightly and begin pumping out 1980s easy listening music.  \n\nThis distracted everyone long enough for the next ATV in line to make his move.  Whilst I had pulled over to the side of the trail and began taking aim on the enraged werewolf, Kevin accelerated toward the beast.  Kevin was wielding a claymore and wore a strength enhancing exoskeleton.  Behind him rode our ordinance specialist.  \n\nGrasping the crossguard of his claymore in a mechanically strengthened hand, Kevin accelerated toward the werewolf.  (IRL there was a six minute break whilst the calculators were broken out) Between the speed of the ATV and the power added by the exosuit, Kevin speared the werewolf on his sword and rammed the blade into a large tree, pinning the werewolf in place.  \n\nSadly, Kevin’s blade had no silver inlay (having destroyed his old sword doing something similar to an ogre) so the werewolf was not *hurt* all that badly.  Fortunately the ordinance expert had a silver sewn 12 gauge slug that put an end to the trapped wolf.  \n\nWithout their heavy hitter, we made short work of the mercenaries and saved as many orcs as we could before the mountain was firebombed.\n\nWe were rewarded with $50,000 by the Monster Control Bureau for one werewolf head and $0 for four human heads.  We replied with a note saying that they should allow us to buy the testing kits for werewolf genetic markers.  \n",

Most creepy crawlies like ghosts and zombies are now considered \"Dark\" creatures, there's a profession called Spook that deals with hunting them down, and a feat you can only pick at character creation called \"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\" allows you to interact with and see these creatures better at night.\n\nAt the very beginning of our campaign I'm a Spook who need the help of our other players to deal with a bogart that just showed up in town. It's terrorizing a farm, throwing rocks at everyone and generally wrecking the place. Once we antagonize it enough, it manifests as a 12 ft tall rock creature. We attack, dodge, get hit, attack, rinse repeat etc.\n\nThe monk of the group keeps on missing with his weapon attacks, so decides to use flurry of blows. (He also previously decided to try and stunning kick  a tree) As I'm yelling at him for being a bloody idiot as we need to use iron against this creature, the GM describes the rock as literally exploding in the area where each hit lands hard enough.

        "text": "Alright gametales, I've been thinking about writing this all down for some time now, and I just reached a lull in my college class (I finished a project faster than expected, and so I have a few hours free), so I thought it was high time to get cracking.\n\nAs the title says, this was my first campaign. Well, the first one I ran as DM, anyway. It started three or four years ago, and went on for several months, with games being held every night that we were on shift (the players and I were in the security department for our ship, so we did everything with imagination and dice-rolling apps whenever we could).\n\nAs is my standard, I like to let my players create characters that they want to play, giving them only a general hint at the tone and level of difficulty (from linear, rats-to-dragons progression to random, unadjusted, if-you-chase-dragons-at-level-1-that's-fine-but-you-will-die-and-have-no-one-to-blame-but-yourself goodness.). This is how the rather eclectic cast was assembled (except for Craig, the veteran player who couldn't make up his mind for some reason and ended up swapping characters after a short period).\n\nSaid eclectic cast is as follows, in **Player || Character: Description** format.\n\n&gt;•••\n\n&gt;**Chris || Soji Okita**: Yes, not the most imaginative name for a samurai. And yes, he decided to play a samurai. Most people I know wouldn't go near that class with an eleven-foot pole, but he was definitely one of those players who liked to feel cool, using his character's badass-ness to buff his ego stat a bit.\n\n&gt;Soji was the scion of a noble family of samurai in the service of the emperor of the kingdom, Japaghanistan (because I was a new DM in the military, I thought this was hilarious), who had just completed his rite of passage, a week-long period of service during which time he was expected to prove both diplomatic skill, adherence to the familial code, and combat prowess. It was his arc that brought the characters together and gave the campaign most of it's direction.\n\n&gt;Despite Chris' desire to play a badass samurai, his rolls were never that impressive, and he insisted on never improving his armor or weapons, as he knew that there would be improved versions of them at the end of his quest. We later explained that, if I was doing a good job of giving out rewards for roleplay and story development, his end reward would be better than whatever gear he picked up before then, but he was persistent.\n\n&gt;**Craig || ~~Thimblecog~~/Little Jon**: Craig, our most veteran player, tends to run into difficulty with open-ended character options. That is, when there isn't a set goal to conquer and build a character towards, he takes a while to settle on a concept he likes. The first character he rolled out was a gnome enchanter, Thimblecog Gearspinner. There were some who called him Tim.\n\n&gt;Tim was essentially only with the party for the duration of a boat trip, then ran off to \"find himself\" opon docking, soon to be replaced by Little Jon, the goliath ranger.\n\n&gt;Little Jon is by far the most broken character I have allowed into a game (remember, this was my first time DMing at this point), and as such was one of the more fun characters I've seen. During character creation, Craig sat down with me to plan on the spending of his wealth. Through some explanation of the rules for magic item creation, and a bit of backstory, he asked for a command-activated ring of Wu Jen Giant Size (colossal). I (having heard of the \"rule of cool\" at this point, and thinking that it applied) allowed it, setting in motion a handy plot device character, which Craig was pretty happy with.\n\n&gt;The remainder of his wealth was spent on some simple gear, and a griffon mount. Like I said - I really had no idea what I was unleashing.\n\n&gt;**Matt || Brother Takeo**: Brother Takeo invited Soji to stay at his monastery for a while, before they departed for the mainland. His personal quest was to see to it that the samurai didn't lose himself in his quest, which was a dark one. He also sought enlightenment, martial strength, and the ability to get by without using it. Yes, Takeo was a Vow of Poverty/Nonviolence/Peace monk. He carried around his copy of the BoED, just in case he got an opportunity to peacefully lay some smack down.\n\n&gt;I've compared Takeo to a dildo on several occasions, and I'll elaborate on the analogy here. Takeo was a monk who tried to avoid fighting, and who tried to keep his companions from doing so as well. This was a fairly combat-centric campaign. While there were opportunities aplenty for diplomacy and level-headed thought (which he excelled at), the others sort of just wanted to play a hack-and-slash. So, while he serves a purpose, and is very useful in that regard, no one wants it out and about all of the time. Much like a dildo.\n\n&gt;Despite Chris and Craig not liking how his character acted, they couldn't deny his incredible combat skills, when he had an opportunity to apply them. He would eventually earn the distinction of going toe-to-toe with two demons at once, and coming out on top (holding his own until the group could escape).\n\n&gt;•••\n\nAs this is *Part One - The Pregame*, I'll be covering the only pregame of this campaign that was actually played through - Soji's rite of passage.\n\nSoji was, again, the scion of a noble family of samurai. His father, Tetsu, was a general in the Emperor's army, serving as both bodyguard and strategist during the last great age of war. Thus, great things were expected of Soji, and he was given simple gear for his coming of age quest, which required him to escort the heir of an allied merchant house through bandit territory.\n\nWe began rolling at roughly the midpoint. Having already had his last meal with his family before being given his mission, Soji and the merchant were a few leagues from their destination when they heard rustling in the tall grass.\n\nSoji, feeling that something was amiss, yet failing his listen check, loosened his blades, and ordered the merchant into the cab of his carriage (which was going at a slow pace to allow Soji to walk alongside and converse with the man).\n\nJust as the door was closing, four men emerged with two spears, a stolen wakizashi, and a longbow between them, all leveled in Soji's direction.\n\nThe men, bandits, demanded that the young samurai hand over the merchant, as well as any weapons, armor, and coin. Soji (who was played by a guy who enjoys the thought of fighting like this) entered his ready stance (held an action) and told them that there was nothing but death waiting for them within the cab.\n\nThe spearmen approached, and Soji used his Iaijutsu mastery and his Kiai Smite, then got to work. He sundered the spears, then made short work of the thinly-armored bandits with Cleave, before moving on to the archer.\n\nHe took an arrow to the shoulder, but closed the distance quickly and took the archer out as well, before turning his attention to the remaining man, giving him his remaining Kiai Smite and cutting him down.\n\nWhen the men were dead, Soji cleaned his blades on their clothing and sheathed them, before arranging the men along the side of the road so as not to impede traffic. He also collected the heads and put them in sacks, so that he might later claim a bounty on the men, if one was available.\n\nWith that done, the samurai went on to enjoy an uneventful trip to the territory of the merchant house.\n\nUpon arrival at the manor of the merchant lord, he was given an ornate box as a gift (worth a few dozen gold), then sent on his way home with a message of appreciation.\n\nSoji traveled unmolested back to his family castle, but was stunned to find that it's occupants had been slaughtered while he was away. The grounds were swarmed with the Emperor's men, who were investigating the tragedy.\n\nThe only survivors were a pair of servants, who had only barely managed to hold on to life long enough to be taken to the healers. Soji was directed to them, and he quickly demanded answers.\n\nThey explained to the orphaned samurai that it had been Nobunaga, another noble lord who had served alongside Tetsu in wartime, who had led the attack. He personally cut down Soji's family, and his men cleared the rest of the grounds, slaying servants and making off with whatever valuables they could carry.\n\nMost offensive was the loss of the ancestral armor and daisho that he had been promised earlier. He had met Nobunaga earlier in the game (during his last meal before beginning the quest), and had raised his concerns about the man's shady demeanor to his father, only to be scolded for judging him for the stress and nervous habits accrued throughout a lifetime of battle.\n\nSoji decided that this would be his reward for slaughtering Nobunaga and his men, and restoring his honor and that of his family. He would prove himself (by virtue of being the sole remaining Okita if nothing else) worthy of the armor and daisho.\n\nAnd so, he departed for the capital, so that he might make his request of the Emperor, and be granted leave to pursue Nobunaga and bring him to justice.",

They'd recently pissed off a few rich and powerful nobles and on the previous night shadow dancers had marked them for death. Death was not their plan for tonght. They were in a caravan train with plenty of other mercenaries and they'd pulled themselves out of worse scrapes than this.\n\nThanks to the charisma of the bard, the party had a few companions, a gnomish war-dog rider named John and a [tanuki](http://ericbelisle.com/weblogs/wp-content/gallery/pathfinder-bestiary-3-paizo-publishing/tanuki.jpg) named Ringo. Fot those of you that don't know, tanuki are shape-changing, light-fingered, sake-drinking mischeivous racoon bastards. Ringo was a kinda hearted tanuki and joined the group as a favour to the party for saving his home forest and family. He decided to change into a bird with good eyesight in order to keep an eye on the situation from above.. A perigrine falcon was picked and thermals were found to glide on.\n\nThe warriors in the party patrolled a small distance, sure that the large vista should keep them safe from sneak attacks, regardless that they'd been marked with small black crosses over their vital organs the previous night. The ranger led his dog to sniff the tracks of the assassins to see if they could work out what direction they might come from and the bard.. The Bard decided to play a song to keep everyone's morale up, this would be the fatal flaw in the plan. \n\nThe music was too appealing. And soon most of the mercenaries in the caravan had gathered around to listen. The small watch was getting a very tavern-like atmosphere. The hubub of people meant that no one spotted a black-robed figure blink into existance in the shadows around the fire. Before anyone noticed, one of the warriors had received 3 extra breathing holes and the camp had been plunged into darkness.\n\nThe now-ventilated warrior failed at grasping his unseen attacker, the bard was too busy trying to get a party going and the ranger was so far away that his chances of hitting anything were slim. It looked dire for the party, the shadow dancer decided to blink into the shade of a nearby caravan and attmpted to make his escape. \n\nDo you know how fast a peregrine falcon dives? I hope you do, considering you clicked the title to this. It's 200mph. Ringo had seen all of what had happened and was now diving at 1/4 of mach 1 towards the foolish assassin. The assassin hears nothing as Ringo turns back into his original 180 pound form and falls ass-first into him. \"CAW CAW MOTHERFUCKER\". The only thing left of the assassin was a thin red streak across the ground.\n\nNeedless to say the party's contract was dropped by most of the assassins in the area.",

The man looked strange. He appeared elvish but with hints of kuo-toa features. A hybrid maybe?\n\nThe elf/kuo-toa introduced himself as “the best alchemist in the business!”\n\n“I turned a man into a goat!” He proclaimed loudly. The elf fighter snickered. \n\nThe alchemist offered to lend his services to us, but when questioned for healing potions he stated his brother handled that, but he would be happy to take us to him. This man seemed to be an idiot, but with no means of healing ourselves in battle, we decided to travel with him to see his brother.\n\nMy mind wandered as we went. I thought of Ta'Vark. What was he doing right now? I imagine he is keeping busy hunting down the Illithid and protecting our plane. Always was great at it. My thoughts didn't wander long, for we soon arrived.\n\nInside, another elf/kuo-toa hybrid was standing arms crossed. On his hip hung a jewel-encrusted sword in a sheath.\n\n“Brother, I see you have brought guests!”\n\nThe alchemist explained to his brother that we were looking for healing potions.\n\n“Ah yes, here. Drink these. They will make you strong.”\n\nHe handed small vials to the drow and myself. I looked at the liquid suspiciously. It seemed okay, and I have certainly had worse. The drow and I looked at each other, shrugged, and drank the mixture.\n\nHow could I have been so foolish.\n\nI awoke some time later with my gear missing. It seemed the drow and I were robbed and left behind. There was no sign of anyone else.\n\nI gathered my bearings, and headed outside. The alley ways were small and tight. I knew I could get a better view from above, so I channeled my psionic energy and ran up the walls.\n\nLeaping from rooftop to rooftop, I spotted my group. They were engaged in battle with these crooks in a wide alley. I moved to better position and took in the scene.\n\nThe alchemist's brother was near the back directing other kuo-toa to fight my group. They had a large creature of a type I have never seen. This large beast was making short work of my group. It was time to even the odds. I channeled my focus inward, and grew several times my size. \n\nThis is going to be fun",

C0D3 M0NK33 has been described as \"The blackest of black trenchcoats when he has a plan. Without a plan, he throws of his trenchcoat, slaps on a wig, and runs screaming into happyland.\n\n**I/O-Ethan Brewer:** A technomancer who emerged at the age of 18. Early on in his career, someone called him a \"Toaster Lover\", a derogatory term for technomancers. He has since picked it up and run with it, making a point of flirting with any piece of technology he can get his hands on. For further jokes, he will often summon a machine sprite into the technology and make people think it is talking back.\n\n**Stan-Stan**: Made to prove a point to a GM. He has 3 in every stat, and no skill above 3. The GM objected to my weird characters, so I made someone that is not weird at all. He only has one quality, and it's Blandness.\n\n___\n\n**D&amp;D**\n\n**Mr. Hilly.** A DMPC from my latest campaign. Actually the Mad Archmage Zagyg in disguise, and the secondary antagonist to the game. In his disguise, he runs a travelling magical item shop with the assistance of his bodyguard (and chaos being), Gurk. When new items are generated, there is a 50% chance of it being cursed. Such items have included a Bag of Tricks that was actually just a bag of holding filled with angry bees, a Hand of the Mage that strangles the user, a Bottle of Air (Bottle of Bodily Gasses), and the infamous Gloves of Falling and Drowning.\n\n**Duh the Socially Inept:** A Half-Orc Cleric with 2 INT. Technically, that shouldn't happen, but the GM decreed he was about as smart as a lizard. Due to his low intelligence, he was ridden by the party Rogue, who had a special saddle designed just for Duh.\n\n**Phantasmo The Amazing!:** A Rogue that attempted to convince everyone he was a Wizard through extensive use of pickpocketing, wands, and mystical mumbo jumbo. Without any arcane casters in the party, no one could tell he was faking.\n\n**Thomalin Darkcaster:** A Neutral Evil Pale Master. He is extremely manipulative and cruel, but managed to convince the party that he was studying necromancy to bring back his long dead parents that were beyond the reach of the gods. Technically true, but he was pure dagnasty evil.\n\n*Thomalin Story Time!*\n\nOur GM had a ~~bullshit~~ house rule that teleport could only be used on one person at a time. So Thomalin gets to work teleporting everyone back to \"home\", which we had all previously agreed was the courtyard of our castle. Teleport has a chance to fail, and he failed it once, on the Paladin's teleportation roll. He was sent to somewhere \"Similar and Close to home.\"\n\nThe GM decided that this was Thomalin's secret underground necromancy laboratory. Now, Tho was supposed to be the primary antagonist of this game. The GM and I had agreed to this at the start. It's why we were 5 instead of the standard 4. Tho had been abducting villagers from our town for experiments, and here they all were, piled up dead or strapped to tables... with a Paladin in the room. Thomalin casts Finger of Death, killing the Paladin.\n\nBut he isn't done. He raises the Paladin and gives him sentience, and a full body suit of armour that he never takes off. As an undead, he no longer needs to sleep, and is now a Blackguard. The player retains control of his character, which is now Evil, and following Thomalin.\n\nMany months later we're doing a quest, and the party is growing suspicious of the Paladin and Tho, who previously were enemies, but now are getting along famously. The rogue knocks the Paladin's helmet off to reveal a grinning skeletal face. Thomalin immediately teleports home and prepares for a siege. Thomalin won. I'm not allowed to be an antagonist anymore.\n\n___\n\n**Video Games:**\n\n**Steals-Brooms-Compulsively:** My Skyrim character. An Argonian Thief who steals every broom he sees, even if he has to outrun guards for it. He loves his brooms.\n\n**Queen Rhaenys the Dragontamer:** Granddaughter of King Aegon the Conquerer,  daughter of King Vaeron the Shadow. Rhaenys came to power after Vaeron was assassinated by his Sister-Wife, Valaera. She was also insane. Before she could even request her coronation from The High Septon, she appointed her horse as chancellor, bit a courtier, and ran naked through the halls of the Red Keep, yet SOMEHOW managed to tame Balerion The Black Dread, who had been rampaging around Kings Landing since Aegon died 30 years ago. Crusader Kings II Game of Thrones mod.\n\nAnd yes, those events are coded into the game. I'm not making it up.",

        "text": "[&lt;&lt; glossary](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2h8xzq/vampiretm_john_randoms_revenge_glossary/)\n\nApproximately has passed in-game, Shula and her (now)husband were living in a nice one story house in a good, moderately wealthy part of town. Their dog was just as energetic and protective as usual, but he still seemed to be a *little* too strong, *slightly* too fast. Shula put it down as a side effect that would fade in time. Shula was now six months’ pregnant with her first son. Jalees had assured her that vitae did not interfere at all with the development of a baby in a mortal (this varies game-by-game), and that it would actually make the baby healthier and better behaved (this is bullshit).\n\nThe end of the city is coming, and the Camarilla know it. A lot of things have gone downhill the past few weeks, and everyone is feeling the pressure. Even mortals have begun to pick up on the encroaching negativity - crime is up, charitable donations are down, people are grumpy and hostile. Ventrue and Brujah are at each other’s throats, Tremere is still trying to find Regent, and Malkavian is even more deranged and problematic than previously thought possible.\n\nShula and her husband, however, were about to be the center of a heated altercation between Jalees and - you guessed it - Ventrue. When Ventrue had gotten wind that Shula had married he put forth a plan that would ensure that her husband was under his control… and then promptly forgot about it. Eight months of game-time later, Shula’s husband was abducted off of the street during his lunch break at work.\n\nEight hours later, Shula began to worry. It wasn’t unusual for her husband to work later than 5p, but he had never been out past 7p before. She had finished cooking dinner a while ago, and it was now cold. She put a low priority call in to Jalees to see if he could dig anything up, put what was left of the meal into [formed plastic containers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupperware), and drew a bath.\n\nAs she finished drying herself off, she heard a single, solid knock on the door and her dog barked happily - Jalees was on her porch. While it was not odd for Jalees to visit on a whim, he always called ahead, even if only by a few minutes. She hurried to the front door and opened it - carefully, she had only some water droplets on - and closed it behind him. Jalees pet the dog, rubbed her belly, then looked her in the eye and said “There is a problem.” Shula put some travelling clothes on, and the terribly mismatched three took Jalees’ car back to his mansion.\n\nJalees had quickly unwinded the twisted thread that was the Ventrue’s plot: Kidnap Shula’s husband and use him as a combination of bait and leverage against Jalees and his ghouls. Jalees had always been regarded as doting upon what few ghouls he employed - even among the Camarilla - he mostly left them alone until he needed them, then ensured that they were well recompensed. Ventrue had planned to use this against Jalees by leveraging his affection for his ghouls in an attempt to secure some power for himself. Of course, this would have worked out a lot better had Ventrue not *completely forgotten* that he had set this plan in motion.\n\nShula was the first to vote for an all out raid on the place, but Jalees put that down quickly:\n\n&gt;Jalees: “No, his mansion is too well guarded to mount an effective offense against.”  \n&gt;Shula: “Then we draw them out of the mansion.”  \n&gt;Other Ghoul: “But how?”  \n&gt;S: “Simple, set up a trade.”  \n&gt;OG: “That will never work.”  \n&gt;J: “Of course it will. Ventrue is too secure in himself to not go for the trade, especially if only the ghouls are involved.”  \n&gt;S: “Exactly - Other Ghoul #2 makes the call to Ventrue’s ghouls, who get word back to go through with it, and try their damndest to double-cross us somehow.”  \n&gt;J: “And he’ll take that risk because he thinks if it ever gets out that I was involved in a ghoul squabble it’d hurt my reputation - and if I do intervene, so can he.”  \n&gt;OG: “But you won’t intervene?”  \n&gt;S: “He won’t need to. I’ve dealt with the kind of stupid that Ventrue attracts.”  \n\nAnd so the gang set about doing the needful; Shula gathered supplies and the other ghouls did what they were told (Shula was always the favorite, and everyone knew it). Some of the other ghouls attempted to convince her to let them handle everything, but their words fell upon deaf ears. Shula had upgraded her arsenal, and was even more dangerous than before:\n\n* Automatic shotgun, six twenty-five round magazines of mixed 00 buckshot and slugs\n* High-powered rifle in bullpup configuration - not .50 cal, but close\n* - with a 40mm grenade launcher attachment\n* Autoloader pistol in 9mm, five twenty-five round extended magazines of incendiary\n* five incendiary grenades\n* ~20 lbs of C4, plus caps/recievers and a remote detonator\n\nAll of this she fit into a single duffel bag, plus a couple changes of clothes, food and other essentials.\n\nThe meeting was arranged, and a time set. Shula wanted to get to the location ahead of time to plant the C4 around the building - “As a safety measure”, she said. She also took the time to plant her weapons in convenient spots around the meeting room - it was a classic run-down warehouse thing. She then retreated to a safe location, had some food, and waited for the Ventrue thugs to show.\n\nIt didn’t take them terribly long. They arrived and scouted the place, but weren’t smart enough to look for C4 or pre-placed weaponry. Shula watched them through the 10x scope mounted on her rifle. They came back to the far street, waited for a van, pulled her husband out and led him into the building. She smiled - this was going to be a cakewalk. She told the other two what to do, and exactly when to do it. She walked into the building, alone and armed only with her knowledge and planning. She even managed to waddle a little more than usual.\n\nThe thugs inside were taken off guard at her appearance - an early thirties, heavily pregnant woman wearing jeans, a maternity sized t-shirt and a jacket. They recovered in time, but she had to stand for a bit before they snapped back to reality enough to think of searching her. She allowed them to, within reason, and made sure they were gentle as they did it. One got a little rough around her stomach, and she delivered a swift kick to his least desirable area in protest. They let her through after that one.\n\nThe Head Slimeball wanted to engage in some form of witty repartee, but Shula had none of it. She told him to stick it where the sun don’t shine and give her husband back, or she’d kill them all. The gears in HS’s head turned at the speed of cold molasses, but when the thoughts finally made their way around his brainpan, he began to laugh.\n\nHe began to laugh at just the right moment to see Shula bend over and pull her shotgun from underneath a tarp. He finished his first laugh just in time to have his head forcibly removed from his shoulders by a three round burst. The two flunkies on either side were next, and she even managed to spray their entrance door enough to make an Intimidation roll to scare them off.\n\nShe rescued her hubby, and lead him back outside - after retrieving her other gear, of course. They and the two other ghouls got into the car and went home to another quiet evening.\n\nThe building exploded an hour later. There were no civilian casualties.\n",

        "text": "[&lt;&lt; glossary](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2h8xzq/vampiretm_john_randoms_revenge_glossary/)\n\nVentrue did not approve of how smoothly Jalees had been handling things of late. Jalees always seemed to have the right answer, the proper paper trail, the perfect story to tell. Jalees was too perfect of a picture to be right. He couldn’t assault Jalees again directly - he had failed miserably too many times - but he could snipe at the lower hanging fruit that had clustered around Jalees. With this goal in mind, Ventrue sent a few of his lackeys around to harass Abdul-Shula. Not start anything particularly nasty, mind, just “rough up the joint a bit, cause some repairable damage to things”.\n\nNow, Shula had adjusted to life under the wing of Jalees relatively well - she answered when Jalees called, and he never asked anything terribly difficult of her. She was mostly tasked with driving him around during the day or night, coming over for a feeding - for her usually, as ghouls burn one blood a month to stay ghouled, or performing some sort of grunt work. Jalees, in reality, had little need of a ghoul, and only put her to work every so often so that no other vamp would attempt to steal her away.\n\nOne bright day, a threesome of bruisers roll up to Shula’s apartment, where she lives with her boyfriend and his dog (I don’t recall what kind, but it was big - German shepard or Doberman sized). Neither Shula nor her boyfriend are home, being good members of working society and what not. Their dog, however, was very much awake and aware of three big idiots attempting to enter his domain - three big idiots that did not smell like good people.\n\nHe started with a warning growl as the lock was jimmied, and began to bark as the door swung slowly inward. Three thugs from a hood gang walked through the door, which while not their first mistake, nor their largest, *was* the mistake that caused the dog to attack them. The description of the fight was striking, the dog being “a mass of quick muscles and flashing teeth” and the three bruisers attempting to put their collective brain cell together to figure out what they should be doing about it as the dog “completely, brutally, no holds barred, murder-faces the first mook”. This was apparently the spark the other two needed to decide that it was a good idea to *kill the dog*.\n\nI will repeat this, because it bears repeating: Seeing this dog kill their friend causes them to decide to **kill the dog**, of the *very dangerous woman* whom they are *in no way* to directly antagonize or disturb.\n\nThe problem here is that the dog isn’t dead. Jalees might have forgiven them if they had actually killed the pup, but to commit an atrocity like that and then not even finish the damn job? Now you were stupid *and* ineffective. Shula comes home first, finds the apartment trashed, one dead body, and one slowly dying dog. Her first reaction is to batphone Jalees - it’s getting towards sundown, and Jalees wakes pretty early relatively speaking. He picks up on the second ring, and is shouting for his car by the second sentence.\n\nShula then had one of the brightest ideas of her solo career - ghoul the dog to keep it stable. Normally only a vampire can ghoul a mortal, but Shula had some pretty potent vitae in her - Jalees was up to about 8th gen - and it was enough to keep her dog alive until Jalees could get there. Shula’s boyfriend arrived home before Jalees, however, and it took all of Shula’s efforts to prevent him from alerting the authorities.  \n\nJalees arrived about five minutes following that, and he took but a moment to survey the scene. He managed to calm Shula’s boyfriend, and even to convince him that they needed some good, hot Chinese food. With him out of the way, Jalees was able to pump enough vitae into the dog to save him, though he, too, was now a ghoul.  \n\n&gt;Jalees: “Shula, this shall wear off in a few months, have no concerns.”  \n&gt;Shula: “Who did this, Jalees? Who would be so bold and foolish as to attack my residence?”  \n&gt;J: “No one who will see another sunrise.”  \n\nShula was reassured by this, now that Jalees was overtly taking this as seriously as she was. He wasn’t really, of course, but she needed him to, and so he acted as if he did.\n\n&gt;J: “I can locate these targets, but I cannot interfere directly. You will have to handle them yourself.”  \n&gt;S: “They will not have a chance to beg for mercy.”  \n\nWith that, Shula went to gear up. Jalees stepped outside to call his contacts and track down the perpetrators, though when he was unsuccessful he turned to thaumiturgy to find them. Using a bit of blood from the corpse and a quick Telepathy with Shula’s dog, he was able to establish enough of a base to use [Illuminate the Trail of Prey](http://www.patman.org/wod/disciplines/wwrituals.asp), and whistled for his car.\n\nTwenty minutes later they had stopped outside of a particularly seedy looking bar in the bad area of town - the kind where you didn’t stay outside past about 5p and cops didn’t exactly respond with haste. Jalees took a short walk about the building and gained a decent idea of the place, and returned to Shula with only bad and worse news.\n\nThe place was jam-packed with about 50 thugs - all sitting around, drinking slowly, checking their phones and watches as if waiting for something important. Jalees had identified the two targets, and it seemed as though they were as center-most as one could get without getting creative about stacking bodies into walls.\n\nShula was unfazed, Jalees was skeptical. Shula began to list what she had brought with her: \n\n* Automatic shotgun, six twenty-five round magazines\n* bullpup of some description, ten fifty round magazines\n* Autoloader pistol in 9mm, five twenty-five round extended magazines\n* three incendiary grenades\n\nJalees was proud. He had her leave the grenades, and gave her his scimitar coated in a mix of vile ichors.\n\nShula *kicked down* the door of the bar, and poured her first shotgun mag into the building before ducking to the side to reload. None of the patrons even knew what hit them - 20 of them died outright, and another 10 had horrible, crippling wounds. The remaining fell to either her second shotgun magazine or were cleaned up as she went around putting pistol rounds in the heads of those that were still writhing. She hauled the two responsible - it was easy to tell the bite marks from the pellet holes - onto a table, and took their heads as proof.\n\nShula came back and wrapped each carefully in a towel, and put them in the boxes that Jalees had set out. Shula went back home to find that her boyfriend was sulkily eating chinese out on the balcony, as an entire army of contractors had arrived to fix the damages. \n\nThe apartment was decent within two hours, and the contractors left without saying anything about a bill.\n\nLater, Jalees would send a couple of other ghouls to clean up the mess and take a headcount of which casualties were accidental - not having been needed to send a message - in order that he may arrange for life insurance or anonymous benefactors or some other form of weregild. It was a cynical surprise to find that all 50 thugs were on the payroll of Ventrue.\n",

We ran into a few lizardfolk, which we then killed. Eventually, we came upon a set of cages. Actually, \"Cages\" is something of an understatement. The tunnel had opened up into a sizable cavern, with bars and barred gates dividing it into sections. We came across a Young Red Dragon. The battle wasn't particularly brutal or glorious, and we took the thing down with relative ease. We then start looting the room, and harvesting the corpse for skin and teeth. It was around this point that we noticed noise coming from the adjacent cage.\n\nA larger Red Dragon was attacking the gate to its cage, and succeeding. Before long, it would be able to exit, and attack us. After engaging it in conversation, it replied, \"YOU...KILLED...MY BROTHER!\"\n\n I decided that some diplomancy was required. I rolled for it, and pointed out that the dragon's younger sibling would have tried to kill the older as soon as it let its guard down, in a vie for power.\n\nThe dragon paused to consider this. \"All of this is true,\" it said, \"but...you still killed my brother.\"\n\nI was trying to figure out the proper angle from which to work this, and was anticipating an interesting social battle, when our Rogue decided to pipe up. I can't recall his exact words, he said something like, \"Well, didn't we do you a favor?\"\n\nThis enraged the dragon, and it resumed its efforts to free itself from captivity. It quickly succeeded. The party had a quick debate as to whether or not to fight it, and chose to retreat. Quickly.\n\nGoing back down the tunnel, we got to a narrow passage that we had passed by earlier. Deciding that we would have to kill this thing at some point, and that it couldn't fit down the passage, we ran in, and came across some more lizardfolk. We killed them, and, after searching the room, found some shields fitted with dragon skin. A few good insight rolls told us that we could use these to block dragon fire. The melee characters each grabbed one, while the casters and ranged characters found some cover, and waited for the dragon.\n\nWe were relatively safe, but the dragon still managed to get hits in some of the time, at least against the melee characters. After several rounds where almost everyone failed to hit the dragon, the DM told us that the dragon appeared to suddenly shrink in size, and went from and Adult to a Young Dragon. This was accompanied by some grumbling about there being too wide a gulf between the two age categories, with no intermediate phase (my personal theory was that the dragon was an Adolescent, and had just undergone a particularly dramatic outbreak of hormones). We eventually killed it, looted what we could from the corpse, and went on our way.",

Seeing the opportunity to announce my professions I declare Krag to be a smith and a baker, but not any baker he is a baker who crafts artisan bread atop his forge.So back to the fight, after announcing my professions my character pulls out two loafs of bread and exclaims to the two former guardsmen \"Gentlemen your nation needs warriors like you, your home needs defenders in these dark times\" Dm has me roll diplomacy (Krag has a -1) Nat fucking 20. the two guards take the bread and walk away mid fight. Then after dispatching the remaining bandits the bandit leader shows up displeased of how we killed her boys. Feeling lucky i pull out another loaf of the newly dubbed \"Combat Bread\" break it and say \" Look ma'am you are an excellent leader and your men are loyal, but a storms coming and your home needs defenders. Join us and fight for this great nation!\" Once again diplomacy roll and again Natural 20. She considers it and then lets us go.

Jurassic Parks, even. :P\n\n*Ahem.*\n\nFor whatever reason, I've been on a weird dinosaur-themed binge lately. Rewatching the old JP videos, the new trailer, a few games on Steam, Terra Nova, etcetera. I blame my inner child.\n\nNow, ordinarily, I think this would pass in time. However, since I play D&amp;D, I've been making it a more persistent idea by mulling over the things I wish I could have seen in the movies and games, and thinking about how they might come to pass in the course of a 3.5 campaign (it's the only system I'm familiar with, and not because I dislike any of the newer systems).\n\nHas anyone else done something like this? What were the results? I understand that, for the most part, dinosaurs run dry around level CR 9 (with the triceratops beating out the tyrannosaur by 1 CR level), but this can always be boosted up a bit by adding templates, awakenings, half-breeds, and magical enhancements.\n\nI have a few ideas for how I would go about setting it up, too. One idea would be to recruit the characters for an exploratory expedition (sailing to a new continent, plane shifting that goes wrong and spits the party into a different time period on the material plane, etc.), with the goal of mapping out the area for settlement or a strategic outpost.\n\nAnother idea would be to surprise the PC's, telling them to roll characters of noble or wealthy backgrounds, putting them on an airship bound for a lush vacation spot, then crashing it onto an island inhabited by the dinos.\n\nA third would be to rip off Jurassic Park - a kindly (wealthy) old man is fascinated with ancient beasts, and wants to create a zoo or a safari featuring them. He hires a bunch of wizards, druids, clerics, etc. to bring a bunch of them to life (or he just pays for a few castings of *wish*), and they inevitably escape. The plot might diverge at this point, as I could justify a larger population of dinos if they eat everyone at the park, breed for a few years, then escape when the fortifications fail.\n\nFinally, I could go the Dino Crisis route and simply drop a few time portals here and there, spilling prehistoric carnivores all over a nice and tidy plane.\n\ntl;dr: Dinosaurs + D&amp;D = ?",

WE'Z HERE!\" Kaptin Gazbag stands up out of his chair, examines his \"pyuta\", and looks out towards his prize. Holy Terra, the seat of the Imperium. \" 'Ere we go...\"\n\n**\"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!\"** echoes through the ship, a bright green light echoing in the emptiness of space. The light and sound intensifies. Psykers in nearby systems faint, and Boyz from around the galaxy join their cry. Bright green ships materialise alongside the Da WAAAAAAGHon. WAAAAAAAGH! Wurldstompa has arrived in Sol, and dey'z gonna zog it.\n\n___\n\n**Da Krew**\n\n**Mad Dok Zagbar Boneshredda:** An outlaw Mad Dok, obsessed with serjery and modifakashuns. He gave himself a \"Ghazghkull Special\", an adamantium skull. He rarely sleeps, kept awake by a toxic concoction he brews himself. He leads a Warband of Orks and Grots that he has modified.\n\n**Kaptin Gazbag Wurldstompa:** Da King o' Da Dakka. Leader of WAAAAAGH! Gazbag, if only because he's the only one who knows how to fly Da WAAAAAAAGHon. He is armed with a horrifying array of looted and modified weaponry. He leads a Warband of lootas and shootas, which he commands from his newly looted tank \"Da Orktress of Arrigance\".\n\n**Big Mek Zapstrak 'Urtybitz:** A hulking monstrosity of metal, Zapstrak is a Cybork Mek, and a member of Da Kult of Speed. Singlehandedly responsible for keeping Da WAAAAAGHon functioning (to Ork standards), he has an unparalleled understanding (by Ork standards) of machinery. He leads a Warband of bikers and deffkoptas. He has built his own bike out of parts looted from various factions that he calls \"Da Wheel of Fortoon.\"\n\n**Snagagrub Zaphead da Grim:** The ship's self appointed \"Cheef Libruain\". He has an unhealthy obsession with The Imperium of Man, and he cannot control his considerable powers. He does not lead a Warband. He used them as an improvised exterminatus. It is taboo to mention it on the ship. He just follows Gazbag around.\n\n**Suh Waagor da Squigrida:** The ship's runtherd, responsible for cultivating and maintaining the large population of gretchin, snotlings and squigs that live in the ship. A feral world Snakebite, he doesn't entirely understand modern Orkoid technology. He is the leader of Da SquigNites, a Warband emulating medieval chivalry, but with Orks riding on facebita squigs. He himself rides a Squiggoth.\n\n**Maggrim da Maggrim**: The ship's idiot. Orks are dumb, but we think his spore matured in a tree, and when he emerged, he fell on his head. A Meganob armed with two power klaws, kustom mega armour, wrist mounted flamas, a deffgun, and a shoulder mounted Shokk Attak Gun, Maggrim is our most powerful fighter. He leads a Warband of ~~complete imbeciles~~ like minded individuals, all with similar armaments.\n\n___\n\nWAAAAAAAGH! Wurldstompa's fleet consists of hundreds of looted ships from various races, but the two most terrifying ships are Da WAAAAAGHON, a hulking monstrosity that has been modified and improved over decades by Zapstrak, and their last aquisition, Kraftwurld Illiner, a stolen craftworld from a minor Eldar faction, which has been fitted to act as an orbital bombardment platform. They also have several thousands Roks with them, being hauled along by their fleet.\n\nKaptin Gazbag gets on da commz to issue his pre-battle speech. This is the moment he has been waiting for. \"BOYZ! DERE'S TERRA! WE'Z WAAAAAGH! WURLDSTOMPA! WE'Z GONNA ZOG 'EM! 'ERE WE GO, ONCE MOAR INTA...\" he stops. He hears a sound echoing throughout the halls, but he's not sure what it is. He rolls perception, and he hears something horrifying. \"^^^ere ^^^we ^^^go, ^^ere ^^we ^^go, ^ere ^we ^go, ere we go, ERE WE GO, **ERE WE GO, WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!**\"\n\nSnagagrub heard his speech from \"Warphead Towah\", and slowly started rocking back and forth, muttering \"ere we go\", whipping all the Weirdboyz in the fleet to do the same. The entire fleet glows green and rockets forward, smashing through the automated early response defenses.\n\n\"ZOG IT! LET'S GEM 'EM! WAAAAAAAAAGH!\" The entire WAAAAAGH! is whipped into a frenzy, ready to attack. When they come down from their WAAAAGH! induced warp, they are floating next to a small red planet, and a huge fleet is in front of them.\n\nThe fleet battle goes on as expected, the Orks taking heavy casualties, but by pure strength of numbers, smashing through the defenses. A signal was sent off to all chapters of the Adeptus Astartes that \"Holy Terra was under threat. The Orks have united, and they will make landfall on Terra.\" Zapstrak intercepted this message, but did not tell anyone. That's more fightin'.\n\nDa Krew begins the plan they had painstakingly constructed over the warp travel over. First, replicating earlier experiments by Zagbar and Snagagrub, they fed grots chopped up pieces of various psychic weaponry, shoved them all into a Rok, and released them into the Scholastica Psykana. Next, they deployed Kratwurld Illiner to bombard The Forbidden Fortress, house of the Astronomicon. Without it, long distance Warp Travel is near impossible.\n\nFinally, they issued a general call. \"ALL FITAS TO YA ROKS! ALL DRIVAS TO YA SHIPS! ALL WARPHEADS TO DA TORPEDOS! NOT YOU SNAGAGRUB! GET BACK HERE YA GIT!\" Roks reigned down on Holy Terra, greenskins pouring out and beginning their grisly work, destroying anything they came across. Ships dropped squadrons of looted tanks and improvised vehicles on key locations, slowly overwhelming the defenses of The Ecclesiarchal Palace. They fired Warpheads at any location they could feel a psychic presence, trying to blind any remaining psychic defenses.\n\nDa WAAAAAAAGHon plowed into the atmosphere, firing every weapon they could, heading for one of the largest psychic signatures they could find, hidden beneath the ice of Antarctica. Da Krew had (unwittingly) chosen their first target, The Office of the Inquisition.\n\nDa Krew drops with their respective warbands in Antarctica, overlooking a region still tingling with WAAAAAGH! energy. The entire region had already been bombarded with Warpheads. They eventually found a small cave in the ice, which they immediately shot to pieces. Inside was a staircase, leading into a secure compound, guarded by some of the fiercest opponents they had ever fought. The High Inquisitors of Terra. Gazbag employs some of his finely tuned negotiation skills.\n\n\"WHERE'S DA EMPRAH, YA GITZ?\" The inquisitors, of course, immediately attack us. The battle wasn't greatly interesting. Zagbar took some pretty heavy damage but managed to take an Inquisitor alive, much to his delight. Snagagrub turned one into a Squig, which Waagor now rides when his Squiggoth is unavailable. He pinned the fallen Inquisitorial Rosette to it. Waagor is an asshole.\n\nDa Krew's warbands start ripping the place apart, killing anyone they find and looting everything that isn't nailed down, and a lot of things that ARE nailed down. Da Krew searches for one especially powerful psychic signature, The Master of the Inquisiton.\n\nThey find him. A tall man in power armour, wielding a force sword and a storm bolter. Without a word he charges in, almost killing Snagagrub in a single blow. Somehow, against all odds, Maggrim is the first to move. Maggrim is not smart. We all know this. We never thought he was this stupid. He fired his Shokk Attak Gun at the Inquisitor at point blank range. A small hole in the warp opened up inside his armour, and, miraculously (the dice LOVE Maggrim) sucks the Inquisitor in. Our GM was not impressed, but everyone was clutching their sides, howling in laughter. We had to take a quick break.\n\n___\n\nThat's where I'll leave it until part 2, which I'll probably write when I get home from University today.",

        "text": "If you didn't catch my [last post](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2tljah/how_the_rat_thief_slew_the_dragon/), this is a continuation into the stories of Mega Rat, the aquatic rodent thief.\n\nThere are two parts to this story, both which rely heavily on the intervention of a rat that is built to steal things.\n\nAfter wandering the desert for ten days and whispering madly to the remains of an elemental, the rodent formerly known as Mega Rat decided on a new name: Ratlantis.\n\nRatlantis then returned to the house of the forger that had promised him a frame for his elemental. After collecting it, Ratlantis determined now would be a good time to find his friends.\nSo he headed north, to the nearby city.\n\nThis city was under Recosans (humanoid snake people) control. The people lived in fear, dreading the wrath of the city's guard and the power wielded by their reptilian clerics. So of course, Sir Peldrin of the Golden Reef (our resident whale paladin) decided to join an underground temple.\n\nLiterally. Their god is Torgen, Master of Stone. The temple is hidden because it has a single manhole entrance into a cave that the clerics meet in. Unfortunately, the rest of the party (minus Ratlantis) go to find him, leading the town guard to the bottleneck entrance. Upon being discovered, Sir Peldrin starts a bloodbath with a commander and a small troop, the party aiding them when all of a sudden, a burst of magic hits the battlefield, nearly killing a few of the party members.\n\nTurns out, there's a bipedal clockwork mechanism firing magical bursts at the party.\n\nWhere's Ratlantis?\n\nClimbing it, of course.\n\nAfter making it to the top, he attempts to open the hatch by picking it, then raw strength. When those methods fail, he knocks.\n\nThe door swings open, and a Recosan fires off some magic bolts, leaving him with 2 HP. Knowing full well another bolt could kill him, Ratlantis dives into the control room, then lights and drops a tinder bomb. The Recosan storms in, sees the bomb, swears, and leaves.\nWith no time to spare, Ratlantis tosses the bomb out and flips every switch he can find, one of them sealing the hatch with him inside.\n\nAt this point, the party cleric decides to call down fire onto the mech. While he continues to pray for the flames of destruction, the rodent thief finds the controls and moves the mech's hands into a praying position.\n\n*GM: Wait, can he do that?*\n\n*Cleric: Mark, what's your devotion?*\n\n*Me: My what?*\n\n*Cleric: He doesn't have any.*\n\n*Cleric (to GM): So he's gonna have to roll a hundred--*\n\n**I roll a hundred sided die: 100**\n\n*GM: Dammit Mark, not again...*\n\n\nRatlantis prays and Torgen, Master of Stone rains meteors upon the battlefield, destroying the last of the troops below.\n\nParty heads over to the large, motionless mech and I call down. Find the Recosan pilot and convince her to drive the thing for us.\n\nThen the cleric heads on into the temple of Akliarha (ack-lee-ar-ah) (a rival god to his), and tries to smite the high priest. Akliarha turns around and says \"*How dare you.*\"\n\n*Cleric: Shit shit shit shit...*\n\nCleric calls out with a spell to the mech.\n\nRatlantis: Can you fire at that temple?\n\nRecosan: You mean the temple of the ***god of my people?***\n\nRatlantis: Yeah, that one. Do me this favor and we'll leave you alone. You can keep the mech, too.\n\nSo the Recosan fired on her god's temple.\n\nAnd the god fired back.\n\nThe energies merged, but the force of the god's power sent it all back at us, moving somewhat slowly. Mega rat heads outside to the mech's shoulder and gets into a martial stance: Cupped Fist.\n\n*Cleric: Wait, what?*\n\n*Cleric: That only works for arrows, right? You grab it and throw it back?*\n\n*Me: It's worth a try. And Ratlantis has -1 mind, so he thinks it'll work.*\n\nThe Recosan walks out of the mech and looks at the rat.\n\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\n**\"I will throw it back at her.\"**\n\n\"So do you have some sort of magic to make that work, or...\"\n\n**\"I AM the magic that makes it work.\"**\n\n\"Screw it. Get in here.\"\n\nRecosan hooks up Ratlantis to the mech. He gets into Cupped Fist and the mech obliges. Turns on magic charge for the hand.\nThen he grabs the energy and throws it back, while the whale paladin Peldrin rides the arm and is violently thrown at the temple.\n\n*GM: You know you take falling damage, right? This WILL kill you.*\n\n*Paladin: I just took Diving Attack. I deal my falling damage to a target I hit instead of taking it.*\n\nMagic hits god before she smites our cleric. Paladin hits god for more damage. God is pissed, temple is destroyed, leaves.\n\nAnd we all walked off into the sunset, until next session.",

        "text": "Yesterday I shared the story of how my friends killed a prominent gang leader. However, this was just one of several escapades where their ingenious stupidity (and my allowance for cool shit to happen) saved them.\n\nThe three acolytes have received a lead taking them to a brothel owned by one of the three largest gangs on the planet. Nautrally, one of them gets a prostitute, one talks to the patron of the brothel and one sits around. \n\nThe guy who got the prostitute (we shall refer to him as Smiles, the nickname i crowned him with IRL) starts asking her questions, but it only reveals a few basic tibbits of information. The second party member, with the owner of the brothel (we shall refer to this player as Psycho from now on, for good reason), attempts and fails intimidate. The third player (nicknamed Cynic) bumps into the Lieutenant of the gang, and this was a means of introducing a semi-important villain who they'll bump into later. However Cynic decides to follow the Lieutenant.\n\nAnd this where things take a turn. Please note this was the first session, and we had never played Dark Heresy before, so our grip on the rules was rather loose.\n\nCynic follows the lieutenant, who goes down an alleyway. Cynic hides behind a bin and watches the lieutenant meet with a couple of upper class looking men in suits with green ties (which is important for later on in the campaign but not the story).\n\nMeanwhile, Smiles and Psycho have regrouped and, thanks to Psiniscience, have detected the presence of Chaos. They go into the attic and find the body of a missing lead, which has had horrific, Slaanesh inspired things happen to it. They proceed to kill the patron, with Psycho contemplating killing everyone in the building but is talked out of it by Smiles.\n\nMeanwhile, Cynic is still observing as the Lieutenant walks out the alley and spots him, taking him hostage. Using the comlink, the lieutenant requests to meet the other two party members in a nearby park. They agree, requesting PDF back up on stand by. They meet the gang members, with a gun being pointed at Cynic's head. And then Psycho makes a decision.\n\n\"I used Spontaneous Combustion on the lieutenant.\"\n\nThe very same lieutenant who has a gun against Cynic's head. I let him roll and he passes his willpower test and at this point I was unaware of the fact a character can resist psychic attacks, so it hits. He rolls one d10 for damage.\n\nAnd gets 10. Plus 6 from varying factors. 16 damage, on the character with 16 wounds. An important villain, one shotted. I almost raged, but allowed it, saying the lieutenant shoots at Cynic in reaction.\n\nI roll over 90, messing up the shot, allowing Cynic to escape from the gang. The PDF show up and gun down the gangsters.\n\nAnd thats why I hate Psykers.",

        "text": "We set off toward the shore, and headed south. Our travels were mostly uneventful. Windum was no help, as usual not giving any useful answers. He was a strange one, far out of place. Even more so than me. Not a single one of us knew what he was, and our questions of the matter were usually struck with obvious states of fact in an almost child-like manner.\n\n“Why happened to you?” was met with “We saw my brother?” and “Why can't you die?” was met with “I don't know, why can't anyone die?” \n\nIt was a chore to keep his attention. His eyes wandered often and his subjects of interest changed rapidly. “What are you?” was asked, only to be replied with, “I'm Windum of course!”\n\nThe only bit of useful information he seemed to have was where we were headed. “The place is home to a large Church of Pelor, we can help my brother there.”\n\nThe town we arrived at was small. The buildings for small and simple, save for the fact that they comprised of large parts of stone mixed with clay and inlay-ed with many of the shiny gems found everywhere in the place. This was true of all buildings save one. Near the shore, a large building stood with a tall, obsidian tower. The building had gems to size of boulders and seemed to be the main source of masonry on the building.\n\nI had barely time to take in this scene before I heard muffled shrieks and screams.\n\n“The Calamity is here! Everyone inside. The Calamity has arrived!”\n\nWho was this Calamity? I was curious to find out, so we continued deeper into town. The people kept there distance as we traveled. I heard whispers of “it's him!” and “the alien!”\n\nIt was not long until we were approached by a group of town guards.\n\n“Leave now, Calamity! We do not want any trouble.”\n\n“Who are you calling Calamity?” the drow challanged.\n\n“Are you not the Calamity that leveled Silver Town?” The guard asked, “We got word the alien was spotted headed this way, and here he stands!” The guard said pointing at me.\n\n“That was a different alien,” I lied, “We just want some food and a place to rest.”\n\nThe guard looked at me, carefully.\n\n“And even if we were this, Calamity,” I added, “What would you do to stop us?”\n\n“Just don't make any trouble.”\n\n“No promises.” I replied as we headed for the inn.",

        "text": "Better him then us. I had known not to trust this Windum. The drow spoke, “You were trying to kill us! I saved your brother!”\n\n“Saved me from what?” We turned to look. There was a young human male standing beside us. He couldn't have been more than 20 human years in age.\n\nThe man smiled, “Brother! You have grown in strength!”\n\nBrother!? Was this human...\n\n“I have, thanks to you.” The Master spoke in his deep, slithering voice.\n\n“I watched you die!” I exclaimed, “You were a broken frail old man and you died!”\n\n“Windum cannot die, mortals,” the Master hissed, “But his state allowed me to absorb some of his power, gaining me strength!” The great serpent began to sink back into the ocean.\n\n“Go now forth and serve me, and you will be granted great power beyond all you can comprehend. Gain domination over this land! Force the followers of Pelor to shun him and serve me. Do this and be showered in reward! Refuse, and be slain. I gain strength either way. The choice is yours!”\n\nThe great head of the massive snake sank below to frozen depths as his words echoed in our minds.\n\nIt was at this time I knew what I must do. This Master could not be trusted, but he possessed the power of a demigod. He was in my head, I could feel him. Years of servitude under our former captors made the Gith sensitive to these things, but it also taught us to keep thoughts we don't want shared to ourselves. My plan began to form. Gain the Master's trust, wait for the moment to strike, kill him, and seize his power.\n\nThe party was arguing with each other about how to proceed, while Windum, in his new young body was looking almost gleeful changing the size of various items he found floating around. \n\n“I will serve the Master!” I stated, “His power is great and with it, we can take this place for ourselves while forcing the locals to serve the Master.”\n\nAs I spoke I felt a surge of power. The Master delivered on his promise. I felt amazingly powerful, like years of meditation and discipline all in an instant. I found I could suddenly focus my power and change my size. I could expel psionic energy around me like a barrier. With a thought I could heal my wounds.\n\nThe party witnessed this, and soon joined me in serving the Master.

        "text": "[This, children, is the part of my campaign where the DM starts rolling dice and cackling.](http://redd.it/2uczwo) This is the part where shit hits the fan, and it doesn't STOP hitting the fan. Maybe whoever it is should stop eating mexican food and hanging out in ventilation shafts I'm on a tangent sorry.\n\nRIGHT. So, [the party (still consisting of Rose the tanky dullahan ranger, Barrel the paranoid halfling rogue, Fishnaut the starry-eyed gillman sorcerer and Pratena the voracious cyclops murderchild)](http://imgur.com/a/kBl11) had just gotten home from their mission to go stop a forest from being on fire. They had largely succeeded, only there was something fucky about Fishnaut and how he was using way-too-powerful magic while constantly emitting little plumes of smoke. Probably not a good thing.\n\nNo time for that, though- some serious shit was going down on the journey home. See, the part of the setting was that the party was operating in a relatively tame area sandwiched between three super-powerful nations. The party's actions to bring a bit more order to the area had the intended effect of making the surrounding countryside more peaceful and less murderous, which, by coincidence, made it a highly appealing target for the conquest of, say, every goddamn nation that was bordering it.\n\nWhich meant that soldiers were popping up. A lot of the dudes the party was seeing didn't take a particularly active or agressive stance (and most of them were monstrous humanoids), but apparently some serious shit was going on down south- there was a MASSIVE exodus. Carts and carts and carts of displaced humanoids were fleeing in sorrow/terror/drunken stupor from the xenophobic jackasses with swords advancing from the southern border. The party was particularly heartbroken when they passed a caravan containing the *entire gnome village* that they used for commissioning weird stuff and pawning magical artifacts.\n\nWhen the party returned to their group's headquarters (they were working for a vigilante/mercenary organization) they found an exceedingly worrying sight- a whole host of monstrous soldiers was accosting the party's boss and demanding that she turn over her \"assets\" to act as footsoldiers to hold back the tide of humans coming fron the south. Nobody was particularly enthusiastic about taking on an army, so everyone natrually told the soldier guys to eat a bag of assorted monster genitals.\n\nThe increasingly-less-polite argument was derailed when the party's boss caught sight of Fishnaut. After a very brief one-sided conversation with herself, she started swearing up a storm and bitching about bad timing. The soldiers seemed to take notice, too, and after a very pointed question on the party's recent whereabouts, half of them left on the spot. Partyboss, meanwhile, rammed something glowy into Fishnaut's head and very firmly directed them all into the basement for reasons.\n\nConfused, the party complied, and a Mysterious Voice^tm in Fishnaut's head instructed them to take the imposing elevator-looking doohicky straight down.\n\nAnd down.\n\nAnd down.\n\nAnd doooooooooown.\n\nThe party emerged, bleary, in a gigantic cavern deep beneath their headquarters. A few cursory glances gave the party some answers to questions they had posed earlier, like where the hell this place got its food. Apparently, from here- the entire place was covered with underground farms, but there weren't any people to be seen.\n\nAfter a bit of magical prodding in Fishnaut's brain, the Mysterious Voice^tm bitched a lot about \"damage control\" and told the party that some vague thing was killing the inhabitants of the cave, and Partyboss wanted the party to \"deal\" with it in the usual manner. So the party blindly wandered around until they found this big pseudo-palace thing, which was filled to the brim with frightened drow.\n\nAfter a bit of questioning (where Fishnaut was the only one capable of understanding their language, *for some reason*^tm ) the party got the idea of some vague force that was picking off lone drow and scuttling into a corner somewhere before anyone could find out what the hell was causing it. So, they stuffed themselves into the palace-thing and collectively pissed themselves while the party tried to think up ways to kill the whatever-the-fuck-it-was.\n\nOne faulty bear trap mishap later, Rose decided to put down the tools and just hunt for clues. What they found (by freak accident) was a swarm of bat-things flying above the fields. THE PLOT THICKENS.\n\nThe party rushed in pursuit, unable to actually affect them from their distance. The bat-things flapped their way into a cave that was way high up a cliff, and the party collectively groaned. Time for climbing...\n\nThey were pretty well-prepared, though. They had recently stumbled upon some sort of magic rope doohicky which had a kinda vague climbing-related effect, and they'd also managed to procure a ring of feather fall, so they'd probably be fine. Pratena tied the rope to the handle of a convenient pick, and then hurled it into the wall of the cliff. The party started to climb.\n\nAnd then the party realized, \"Why the fuck are we climbing UP, into the monster's territory? Shouldn't we make them come DOWN, where they don't have the home field advantage?\"\n\nThis was perfectly sound reasoning. So, Barrel pissed off one of the bats with a lucky arrow hit, and the rest of the party put on their best \"COME AT ME BRO\" faces. When this didn't take, Fishnaut casted Black Tentacles on their asses when they all peeked over the edge of the cliff.\n\nThis succeeded in pissing off the things in the monster-den. One bout of ominous rumbling later, the entire party was comically horrified to be accosted by that most wonderful of underground monsters... the Titan Centipede. Yeah, the one listed as \"Collossal\" in size category. And it had a rider. Granted, not a very competent rider, as it was clearly barely keeping its grip on the bucking monstrosity, but it was clear that this whole thing was bad news.\n\nThe good news was that Fishnaut had access to Scorching Ray on full auto.\n\nTo give you all some context on the situation, the centipede was still a ways up on the party's turn, and well within range of the spell. All it required to deal damage was a touch attack, and the touch AC of collossal creatures is *laughable*. Hitting a stationary object requires a roll greater than 10- hitting a titan centipede requires a roll of *2*. It was literally harder to hit the broad side of a goddamned barn.\n\nWhich is why it took just about everyone by surprise when Fishnaut *MISSED*. The centipede had just come down HARD on Rose, who tanked the blow beautifully (and was immune to poison, natch), and the damn thing still had most of its ass 60ft up on the rock wall. When Fishnaut failed the roll, his ray went wild and blasted the wall right near the centipede's top legs.\n\nWhat followed was an exercise in topography and a lesson in physics. The centipede's top legs lost their grip on the heated rock, and a little momentum became a lot of momentum, and a few very unfortunate bat-things realized that they had picked an exceedingly bad airspace to occupy. Pratena and Barrel set about bashing in the brains of the bat-things while Rose and Fishnaut turned the battered centipede into a rich-smelling foreign delicacy. The only issue left was the rider of the centipede (a vageuly lizard-ish thing), who had taken a pretty bad fall and wanted no part in this business, thank you sir.\n\nIt screamed something that made half the party start trying to stab out their own eardrums, and then booked it. Except for the part where Barrel shanked it in the kidneys, whoops. The lizard-thing lay dying, and the moment was only slightly dampened when Rose's arm spontaneously fell off. [She did not take it well.](http://puu.sh/ffKtl/373599c878.png)\n\nAnyway, they wrapped things up underground and headed back up, to find that the monster-army-thing was *still there*, and still arguing with Partyboss despite the fact that she was pretty clearly not saying anything. This had apparently been going on for about six hours, they must have had to break for lunch at some point.\n\nAnyway, patiences were wearing thin, and the spidery dude leading the monster-army was getting pretty irate, so Barrel decided to wearily cut in about having an army of cyclopses in the basement and how if they didn't get the fuck off our property right fucking NOW then lunch would be conducted upstairs, and it would be an all-you-can-kill buffet. Spider-dude decided not to push his luck, and withdraw for the moment.\n\nWhich is when the base, as well as the **entire goddamned mountain it was sitting on**, teleported away with the party inside.\n\n*Just as Partyboss had planned.*\n\n[NEXT TIME ON \"Centipedes?

I rolled out in my KV-2 to test it out. (for reference, this is a kv2. http://www.armchairgeneral.com/rkkaww2/galleries/KV/KV_2M41/photo/KV_2M41_13.jpg achtung tiger!) Wow. This is amazing. Really a tank sim. I look over to my right. I see a friendly t-34 with no name plate floating above it. This is going to be fun. \n\n\nSo, I rolled by clumsy bunker-on-tracks into the town. I was paranoid of flanking tigers at every intersection. No interface was a daunting gamemode. After a painfully slow advance, pushing on throughout attempted dive bombings, my gun optics were graced with the sight of the canal. I edged myself closer, readying my gunsight to put 152mm of armor penetrating destruction into the armor of any approaching german. \n\n\n\nSuddenly, a medium behind me explodes, and the chat reads: TIGER, E5! shit shit shit shit shit. I turn my turret as a my armor fails to bounce the fearsome 88mm, killing my gunner. The tiger is right next to the canal, with only weak railings between it and a watery grave. I punch W, and the tank lurches into action. I'm alone now, my only support was the t-34 fireballed by the tiger. The sluggish mass of fifty tons reaches a mighty speed of 15km/h, and as the tiger fires a second time, I bounce the shell. I slam into The tiger, damaging my transmission and tracks. But the tiger is no better. It flips onto it's side as it slides into the canal, it's a 90 degree turn.\n\n\nThe chat reads: WTF \nlololol kv-2\nhaaaaaaaaaaaa\nawesome!",

        "text": "[More tales from my off-kilter campaign!](http://redd.it/2t3u1o) Today's mission for [the party (that being Fishnaut the starry-eyed gillman sorcerer, Barrel the paranoid halfling rogue, Pratena the voracious cyclops murderchild, and Rose the tanky dullahan ranger) ](http://imgur.com/a/kBl11) was to go investigate what happened to some former comrades. Yeah, the party was all on retainer to a sort of vigilante-mercenary troupe, and a group had been away for a long time without reporting back. Also, the forest where they were last seen was mildly on fire, so if y'all could put a stop to whatever's making that happen, that would be grand.\n\nThe party set off, heading to their comrade's last known location. They had been sent on a bit of a milk run, to investigate the ruins of an old town that had been put to the torch decades ago. Rumor had it there were signs of life.\n\nThere were not. What there were a lot of, though, was skeletons. Skeletons that resembled little cartoon animals with way the fuck too many teeth. The whole village had been burned to the ground, stabbed a bit, and then burned again for good measure. The reason being, as the party soon discovered, these little animal dudes apparently had a thing for strapping people to sacrificial altars and performing hideous rituals.\n\nDespite the fact that the ruins were at least twenty years old and very clearly thoroughly destroyed, nobody was really comfortable with hanging around... though they did briefly consider tossing a few flasks of alchemist's fire at the bodies, just to be sure.\n\nAnyway, following that, Rose picked up the tracks of the previous group to come through. Cart tracks that did not go back on the nice, safe road and instead took a detour through some pretty dense, jungle-y woods. Well, this wasn't going anywhere good.\n\nThe party trundled off through the undergrowth until they happened upon a riverbed, where a bunch of frogmen were keeping guard. The guards greeted the party cheerfully, welcoming them to the village of \"We-Will-Rape-And-Cannibalize-Your-Steaming-Corpse\". The party was then jovially warned that if they crossed the riverbed or did anything funny, everyone nearby would vigorously live up to their village's namesake.\n\nFishnaut decided to question these delightful folks, asking if they had seen another band of adventurers. They had. And those people had unwisely decided to cross the riverbed, and were currently rotting in one of the piles back there. That answered that. Fishnaut just had one more question- \"Can you dodge a lightning bolt?\"\n\nThey could not.\n\nThe battle that followed was rather hard on Rose (who was quickly swarmed by the buggers), but with Barrel providing a lot of damage and rolling ungodly well on stealth, nobody really came within spitting distance of Fishnaut, who was slinging spells one after another at isolated groups of rapey frogmen. Of course, it couldn't have been that easy- one of the bastards croaked something about a \"warleader\" before giving up the ghost.\n\nAaaaand then a giant murderlizard nearly ate Fishnaut. Pratena leapt onto the thing and started tearing off chunks of flesh, Rose bopped the thing in the snout (with her shield) to assert dominance and free Fishnaut, and Barrel took advantage of the flank to sever the lizard's tail. Then he followed it up by severing the lizards, erm, *other* tail. This angered the lizard. It tried to eat Barrel, but his outfit got lodged in the thing's mouth... so he dropped about a dozen alchemist's fires down its gullet.\n\nThe lizard made a very brief dragon impersonation, and the entire party rolled reflex saves against being part of the meatsplosion. Pratena ate well that night.\n\nThat done, the party dusted their hands, got some rest, and decided to investigate the rampant forest fires. Yeah, that was still a thing, it didn't go away. So off they went, to go apply their murderhobo skills to the problem until it stopped existing.\n\nThe source of the fire, it turned out, was a trio of dryads. But not the leafy sort, no- the sort that's very bitter about being enslaved by the mind of a plant, and wants very much to make them all be on fire. Unfortunately, these dryads were having a bit of trouble- the forest has ways to shut that whole thing down. All this wet wood was not nearly as flammable as it looked, and some of the flames were fizzling out weirdly.\n\nThe party tried to reason with the snarling, flame-coated dryads. Unfortunately, reason doesn't work on people who are completely and utterly butterly, stark raving pants-on-head batshit, and generally angry and unpleasant. The situation was not helped by a swarm of midgets who lept out of the bushes brandishing weapons.\n\nNow, these weren't some magical fantasy race. Nope, not halflings or dwarves... they were just jungle-dwelling midgets. Who popped out of the bushes, wielding primitive weapons and screaming *\"WOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLO!\"* The party almost felt bad for killing them, especially after they failed several consecutive saves to keep their feet on the difficult terrain. They were significantly less iffy about it when one of them went full lumberjack on Barrel.\n\nThe other party members, meanwhile, were having fun with the casty dryads. They were powerful wizards, but apparently not critical thinkers, allowing the party to get so close before attacking. Pratena pinned down one who was in the middle of a ring of fire (unfortunately gettings some severe burns and a chunk taken out of her shoulder in the process), and Rose double-teamed with Barrel to put down the other two in a hail of spear-strikes and well-placed knives. Fishnaut was on crowd control, and countering the nastiest things that the dryads threw at them. He was rolling really hot.\n\nLike, hotter than was physically possible for a sorcerer of that level to roll.\n\nSomething was fucky with his magic, is what I'm saying. And the fact that he seemed to be smoking for a while afterwards did not help matters. Still, the midgets were routed, the dryads were dead, and the missing party was accounted for, and their killers had been brought to justice. Maybe it wasn't saving the world just yet, but they had done good. Time to head home!\n\n[NEXT TIME ON \"Dinner and a show\", BAD THINGS ON THE HORIZON AND ATROCIOUS TIMING!](http://redd.it/2ue20h)",

I just got done playing part of our campaign, we were in a city fighting a large cult working out of the basement of a building within the walls, who had been kidnapping guards and citizens to turn into zombies and harness their souls for some evil purpose or another. We were in the final room where a ritual was taking place, which contained two cultist mages, a zombie, three cultists, four drows in each corner of the room, and a woman being dragged to some vat of liquid in the center of the room. We killed a few cultists and drows, advancing to the woman to rescue her like the good adventurers we were, and then a mage casts a fireball attack, catching our entire party, and the woman, on fire.\n\nThis put the woman into bleedout, and I had to think fast. I simply said \"I roll to piss on the flames of the woman.\" Everyone went silent and I just heard \"What the fuck?\" from one of the other players. The DM made me roll a d20 to confirm, and I got a nine I believe. However, the DM decided to make this cause \"spray\" and I pissed on my ENTIRE party, along with the woman, extinguishing us all. Our whole group burst out laughing and we proceeded on to stabilize the woman and win the fight. So yeah, my quick thinking and quick penis-work saved the entire party and earned us brownie points with the local military.\n\nSorry if this is too short, this is my first gametale. I'm a bit too concise at times, but I just wanted to put this out there because it was hilarious.",

They are to investigate rumours of cult activity, and soon discover that 1) there are two cults, one dedicated to Khorne and one to Slaanesh. 2) Two of the three largest gangs in the planet's capital are part of a cult each.\n\nNear the end of our second session, and the group have carried out several investigations and have killed a lieutenant from both heretical gangs, and worked with a third gang to essentially wipe out the Slaaneshi gang. After a firefight with the Khorne worshipping gang, and escaping with the group Psyker getting a broken leg, they arrive back at the apartment block they are staying in.\n\nWho else is waiting for them but the leader of the Slaanesh worshipping gang. She claims she is extremely pissed off with the group, and is going to kill them. And then one of my players said something stupid.\n\n\"I tell her the men she is looking for are in the apartment next door.\"\n\nI laughed at that. He told me he was going to seriously try it. So I told him to roll for deceive, telling him that he needed an 8 or lower on d100 due to his 48 fellowship being reduced by a) not knowing the skill and b) the fact the lie is stupid as hell. He rolls…\n\n…And he rolls and 8.\n\nI'm left stunned as my three friends burst into laughter. I tell them how the gang leader apoligises profusely, runs into the neighbouring apartment and they hear lasgun fire, before hearing the words \"Wait, this is a family of five\".\n\nThey walk/hobble to the doorway pf their now deceased neighbours as the gang leader realises her mistake. The psyker tells me he wants to use his combustion spell, the group gunman tells me of how he shoots with his flamer. They one shot the gang leader, setting her and the room ablaze and she jumps through the window to her death.\n\n\"Right, so you have set the room on fire. Do you want to put this out or call the PDF to do it?\"\n\nThey decide to let the fire burn down the apartment block and fake their own deaths.",

Achieve perfection, that is my journey.\n\nI continued to read through the book to learn more. As I was reading, a group of three kuo-toa approached. They were not pleased with my killing of their companions in the arena. They stated I cheated and wanted vengeance. I calmly stood and told them I did not have time for them right now as I was doing important research. They attacked and failed to land a single blow. My reflexes are swift. In one smooth motion, I kicked the scaly head of one of the creatures clean across the room. The other two stopped and swore allegiance to me. I accepted, as there is always use for fodder.\n\nMy group was speaking with an aquatic elf near a door in the back. They seemed to be arguing about the amount of food awarded. The elf motioned for us to follow him in the back. Crossing through the threshold we came face to face with a large, 8-legged monstrosity. The spider was perched on his giant web, observing us. I approached and offered a sign of peace. Spiders have always interested me. The are patient and calculating which are traits I have come to admire.\n\nThe spider ignored my advance and I returned to the group. Suddenly, a large group of aquatic elves ambushed us. They did not put up much resistance and were soon slain. I offered the body of their leader to the spider, who immediately swooped him up and began wrapping him in web. We were lead out the back door by the ogre guards and met up with Windum. He looked like he had aged quite a bit and was even more frail than before.\n\nWindum told us he had spoken with his brother and that his brother wanted to meet. We traveled North for a few days until we came to a frigid coastline. Off in the distance was a small island chain. Windum conjured a boat and set sail for the islands.\n\nWe were attacked along the way by some more aquatic elves and a few mermaids. I ordered my kuo-toa followers to attack and they were quickly killed. The mermaids destroyed our vessel and I fell into the freezing water. The cold was unbearable, even for one of strong mind as myself. I almost drowned in a panic before I made my way to a floating iceberg.\n\nThe hostiles were eliminated and we slowly floated our way toward the island chain. We were headed toward a large cave on the side of the nearest island. Windum told us his brother was inside waiting. I objected stating my mistrust of Windum and his brother, but was silenced by a loud voice inside my head. We reluctantly entered. \n\nIt was not long before we were brought to a dinning table stocked completely with food. We were allowed to eat while we waited for Windum's brother. The elf asked Windum why his brother wanted to see us. “Well, to kill you.” Windum replied non-nonchalantly. We turned to leave when suddenly, the entire ground started shaking. Water began rushing toward us from deeper within the cave. \n\nI tackled Windum over the table, breaking his frail body, before turning and running for the mouth of the cave. The drow and the elf went back for him, saying we needed him. They carried Windum back toward the mouth, but the cave appeared to be collapsing down on us. I tumbled out and was greeted by the freezing ocean water outside. I quickly climbed out and joined the group. \n\nWindum was lying, broken and injured. He turned and smiled. “My brother is pleased!” He said, before he closed his eyes and vanished. We turned behind us and watched as the island chain began to move. They sank below the water before rising again. Only these were not islands at all. No, they were in fact just small parts of the gigantic, several mile long serpent that was rising out of the ocean behind us.\n\n“I am the Master, and you have killed my brother.”",

Windum noticed the parties struggles and pulled out a small loaf of bread. He broke off a piece and offered it freely. The party began to fight over the the small amount of food, until the piece of bread enlarged to many times its size. He broke another piece and it did the same. He continued to do so until everyone had something to eat. The party stood stunned. The drow asked how this could be. Windum replied that he had always done it. He then vanished. \n\nIn the tavern, a group of human were engaged in an arm wrestling match. I challenged the winner and he accepted. “20 gold bet!” I did not understand what he meant by that, but sat down anyway. I easily beat him and the next few challengers who sat down with me. I soon beat everyone in the tavern. They pushed a large stack of small gold disks toward me. I knew not what they were for, but they did not seem of any value to me. I stood up and left the pile on the table. The drow collected the metal from the table, telling the tavern folk he handled my “finances”, whatever that was.\n\nOutside, the Guardians of Pelor were questioning town folk about this “alien” they got word of. I was tired of running, and went outside to confront them. They told me I would die in the name of Pelor. I fought them for a while, my group joined in as well. They were strong, abnormally strong. After many hits, they would not drop. Windum returned and unleashed the rat. The rodent slaughtered the Guardians and as he came to the last one, the guard touched his ring to his amulet. The began to glow brightly and gave off a lot of heat. I quickly grabbed them and ran toward the ocean. I dropped them into the water, which caused it to boil and, before I knew it, they exploded in a brilliant flash.\n\nThat was almost the end for Akma'ilith Duu, but I managed to survive with help from the drow. I swore a life debt to be repaid, something that made me sick, but I had not fulfilled my goals and could not die yet.\n\nWindum told us his brother would know what to do and said he would take us to him. I did not trust Windum. He was not telling us everything and I do not like being lied too. In the end, we agreed to meet with his brother. I had a brother as well, an adopted Githyanki brother who was a powerful psychic warrior. Yes, my brother is part of that treacherous race the Githyanki, but Ta'Vark did  not bother me. I even sort of liked him.\n\nThe sounds of trumpets could be heard in the distance so we escaped inside a cave. Not far down, we were stopped by a pair of ogres. They told us in order to gain entry we must pay in food or fight in the arena. Having no food and with Windum nowhere to be found, we chose the arena. Truth is, that sounded better to me anyway.\n\nI was first to battle. I faced a couple small, scaly creatures called kua-toa. The pixie sneaked in and put them to sleep allowing an easy victory. I was awarded with food. The bard, the elf, and the duegar were next and quickly defeated the bear they were faced with. Gai-ell was last, and ended up being defeated by a large swarm of bats.\n\nGai-ell was patched up and allowed to return to our group as we were eating. The place had decorated the walls with many symbols of Pelor, but they were crossed out. I read through the book of Pelor I found on the guard. I asked around for information on this god, but all I could get from anyone was that they no longer served Pelor. When I asked why, they said they had a new Master now. When asked who that was, they simply replied, “We serve the Master!” \n\n[part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/2u4nz8/the_memoirs_of_akmailith_duu_part_1/)\n\n[part 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/2u50hi/the_memoirs_of_akmailith_duu_part_2/)\n\nedit: spelling\n",

The other links are there.\n Part 4: http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2ttrwr/dd_355e_mix_the_tale_of_belin_the_unlucky/\n\nWhen we last left our hero he had just received a invitation to the Town of Heroes. Now we continue our story with the party on their way there. This journey is pretty lengthy so we had to make camp and ect. While camping some of us decide hunt out some food and save our rations for a dungeon or hard time. The monk, rogue, and myself decide to be the ones to find food. We go out into the woods. The monk decides to look for rabbits or something. The rogue says he's getting nuts and berries. Naturally I look the DM in the face and say \"I'm hunting for something big. Like a bear.\" A little shocked he say's \"ok you see tracks that lead to a cave. You can see something black at the entrance.\" Belin proceeds to pick up a rock as big as his torso and with a heave throws the rock at the bear. Due to some ridiculously good rolling on my part, the rock hits the bear in the face and the bear dies. Belin walks over grabs it's leg and drags it back to camp. The others are already back with their measly gathered food. As Belin walks into camp they all freak out. The Dragonborn looks at Belin and say's \"What the hell dude.\" Belin explains that he wanted to get enough to feed everyone and have some extra. Belin also makes sure to tell them that he killed it without ever drawing either of his weapons. He pulls out a rough looking dagger (that he made) and skins the bear. He rips out it's heart an takes a bite. To gain it's courage he says. The party is now well fed and proceeds to sleep and swap watch. \n\nAs the sun rises Belin hears a high pitched noise and wakes up the rest of the party. Now everyone readies their weapons and gets ready for a fight. Suddenly 3 orcs riding raptors come rushing from down the road. Bandits. One runs straight towards Belin and (with a little help from rage) he takes the orc right off of the raptor with a solid hit. The other two attack the rest of the party. It's a two on two all around. Belin might as well count as two people lol. Somehow the raptor and orc both seem to miss their attacks on Belin. Next turn the orc is murdered with another hard hit from Belin. The others are still having trouble getting theirs. Finally Belin kills the raptor too as the others are killing off orcs. It's about this time that one of the raptors goes to run away. Guess who's in his way? It's at this time that Belin gets an attack of opportunity against it. DM tells me to roll for my attack. It's at this time that Belin surprised them all. After a nice natural 19, He dropped his sword and grabbed the raptor by the throat and slammed it to the ground. Now as it tries to squirm loose I start making handle animal checks. Thanks to some decent rolls and the leftover bear meat, Belin now has a Raptor mount. DM tells me that it's really untrained and will only carry me and stay where I tell it. No other comands. The party is shocked. With a shrug \"Raptor likes Orcs\" is all they get out of Belin. After searching the Orcs and the saddles on the other raptors, we continue on our journey. Belin took no loot but did skin the raptors. The rest are walking as Belin rides. In style I might add. We peacefully journey the rest of the way.\n\nWe finally get to the town. We get stopped at the gate. The guard asks us what business we have in the town. Before we can say anything something unexpected happens. Our group has a rule that when we play we either put our cell phones together or at least make sure they are on silent. I broke this rule that night. I had accidentally forgot to put mine on silent. After he asks the question my phone starts ringing. Of course wouldn't you know it, my ringtone is the exocist theme. The guard says \"Oh, your here to hunt a demon are ya?\" After some heavy laughing and me putting it my phone on silent, we give the guard our invitation. He informs us of a few rules and tells us to go talk to the mayor before getting comfortable. DM informs us that people are seriously freaking out over a huge barrel chested half orc with two huge weapons and blood on his clothes riding into town on a raptor. I had forgotten about the bears blood being on me until now. The rogue responds that with how unpredictable Belin is they are right to be scared. I decide to stable my raptor with a lot of bear meat to keep him happy and I wash off. We head towards the mayor. As it turns out the mayor is one of the DM's old characters and many of the town members are too. On the steps of the town hall we walk up to see a minotaur eating a biscut the size of a halflings head. We talk to him and he welcomes us. He excuses himself for a appointment. Suddenly a half orc about the size of Belin walks up. The two engage in a fist fight and the mayor drops him. The mayor explains that once every two weeks the orc challenges him for mayor and has to be beaten down. This was also a old PC that used to fight our DM all the time lol. Now we are in the Town of Heroes. As you can imagine the cleric hits up the temple, the dragonborn hits up the tavern, the rogue sets up shop for his gambling, the monk wonders off, and Belin tends to his new mount. Time for some training. The party offers to pay and have someone do it under the condition that we use it as a pack mule and Belin can't ride it anymore. At this time Belin has kinda developed a bond with it and wants the pleasure of training it. Belin works hard to teach him some simple comands and then afterwards seeks out a blacksmith to get some training.  Figures a smith in the town of heroes would be worth learning from. Upon arrival, Belin trades the bear's pelt and raptor skins for training. \n\nEdit: Just wanted to say this. I know a lot of people probably wonder why we stick around in towns and why I do so much stuff with NPC's as Belin. It's because I want to build his personality and give him depth. To take him from a character sheet and turn him into a person. I want people to think \"That's someone I'd like to have around\" or \"That guy would be a good friend.\" I don't want them to think of him a just a character I played once. So I make sure to do more than just adventure and smash things. Teaching villagers to defend themselves, giving out food, and bonding with the locals. That's why Belin is building a rep and my other party members aren't. I tell the DM in detail what I want to do and how I want to do it. The rest of my group say things like \"I guess I'll go pray at the temple and stuff.\" or \"I'll just get drunk at the bar until they're ready to go onto the next thing\"",

        "text": "If you already haven't, I suggest reading the first story. \n A year after the events of the Mactown Fire have gone by. Devin, now thinking his luck is amazing, heads to Vegas.\n Welkin goes there as well in order to get revenge on Devin. James is living in Vegas with his prize winning show doc he bought named, \"Dongulous.\" \n After the party meets up again, they all agree to go to Jame's dog show that would happen a few hours later. In this time, Devin would take a suitcase he has with him and sell what would be inside; Drugs. \n After sold, he goes over to meet up with James and Welkin. James says he has a plan to take the drugs he bought from the guy Devin sold him *however they don't know Devin sold the dealer it* and put them into the water of all the other dogs so his could win. \n James ends up drugging every dog, including his. Welkin talks the chance to sneak into Devin's room so he can look through Devin's things, but is stopped by James. \n After the dog show, they all go back to Devin's room. Welkin says he ended up finding a deposit box key, which lead to a money stash. All three plan out a mini heist to get in without being spotted.   After about a day of preparing, they all go and get ready to start. They would all dress up like guards and get in from there \n The tilt begins, and the trio finds out that the box has already been broken into by a gangster on the other side of the city. They all agree to go after him and get the cash from there. \n James used his dog as protection as they went to the area that the gangster was most likely at. After looking/ hearing around, they find his base. However, they find out the police are already there in the top floor. \n They sneak in to the basement where the money can be seen. They get stopped dead on their tracks by gunpoint. The gunman and gangster himself was Vince. \n Vince explains after the article of the fire went out, he was arrested after Secretly being sold out by Devin and the others, having all the blame put on him. After 7 months of being in prison, he escaped during a massive prison break. He later came to Vegas and started a life of crime. \n After telling his story, Welkin up swearing at him, and Vince shoots Welkin in the leg. \n James try's to convince Vince into buying his dog, as he can get more money. He refuses. \n As he does, Devin goes in for the kill and attempts to knock the gun out of Vince's hand. Missing, Devin gets shot in the stomach. James once again offers the dog if he can get the money and have everyone being able to leave. \n Vince puts thought into it, and agrees to buy Dongulous. \n In the end, James gets rich and keeps the cash for himself. He stays in Vegas. \n Devin manages to survive, but after the events of what happened, he would never return to Vegas again as he is to scared to. \n Welkin gets away as well without any real physical or mental damage. He does, however, plan to now get revenge on James for taking everything. \n We never have done a third one yet, however plans for this are soon. Once we play it and get it done, I will post it. Not sure when this will be though. ",

If you aren't aware of what Fiasco is, it's basically a game were you build a story by positive and negative die. We used The Ice play set for this particular story. \n The characters involved would be Devin, Welkin, James, and we would later add another named Vince. Devin and Welkin's were great friends, James and Devin knew one another from surviving an accident, and Welkin and James were new friends. I played as Devin, this was how the story went:\n All three guys would stand at a observation hill in a place called Mactown. \nDevin and James would tell Welkin about how they accidentally burnt a cabin to the ground when screwing around with Welkin's flare gun, which was giving to Devin as a gift. They all decided that they would go back to the scene of the crime later the next day to find the flare shot. \n James tried to tell Welkin how he thinks Devin did it on purpose, so Welkin said he would watch him more carefully. \n While Devin walked home, he stopped by the cabin and threw the gun away in its nearby trash, forgetting to bury it deeply. \nThe next day comes and they head back. They don't find the flare, but learn a family lived there. They all sigh and get going\nAct one ends here, so the Tilt (This is something that happens that bends the story up when going into the second act) would begin. \nWhile going home, the party meets Vince, a news reporter who sold out Welkin by telling the press that his drugs were really Welkin's, in order to get that perfect story. \n They have a quick meeting, when Vince tells them he will be investigating the cabin and writing the story about it. \n They all decide to plan to get Vince told out. The plan was to take Welkin's dead seal he has and put it in Vince's office. Once discovered he would be caught and fired. They would all be heroes. \n While doing this, Devin goes back to the trash to get the gun back. However, Vince is seen digging around for evidence for the story.  Devin decides to tell Vince he knows what happened, in order for him to save himself. They plan to have an interview the next day. \n Welkin's plan ends up failing. They never found the seal. Devin did the interview and didn't get blamed for it. \n In the end, everyone is not found guilty. Devin becomes the hero of Mactown for \"catching the criminals.\" Welkin becomes the most hated of them all, and plots revenge on Devin. James decides to leave Mactown while he had the chance. \n This was our story, we ending up making a second on in Vegas. I'll post this one later. \n",

It starts off with me wandering into the rest of the parties camp having run out of food and getting lost in the forest and see their fire.\n\nI come up offer to accompany them as a guard for food. Which proceeds to setoff the Jobold who I was talking to who suddenly asks where he is I tell him the woods and he freaks out and runs underneath the Carriage.\n\nI start talking with the other guy at the camp when the Kobold starts freaking out again. (Turns out the other guy who just joined was a Rogue and was stealing shit so we keep getting listen checks and shit.) The Kobold used detect magic to find where all the potions went and then cast it on me and the other guy in the camp and we looked for the thief. We couldn't spot it at all and kept getting pelted with rocks so we freaked the fuck out.\n\nI went to a dead tree grabbed a branch and lit on fire using the branch I then lit the tree on fire and we were going to light the perimeter on fire when suddenly a gnome appeared from the shadows saying he was a traveler. We told him we needed to get the fuck out of there since there was some sort of monster hiding in the darkness.\n\nWe move on to getting attacked by orcs. Insane 900 year old kobold who had been hiding in the Carriage since he got pelted with rocks proceeds to ram the orcs with the carriage/horse jumps off the Carriage and proceeds to grapple a Orc. Rips out his eye and then eats. Then proceeds to spray acid down his throat with a concentration check and a spellcraft check.(Most notable point of combat)\n\nAfter combats over the Rogue interrogated the orc we loaded up all the loot and the Dragonwrought Kobold entered through the acid destroyed mouth of one of the orcs and ate his heart. Also ate his brains. Then ripped the tongue out of the still living orc and he got pushed down the road with a small bit of rations.\n\nEventually we get to what used to be an outpost along the road with cages suspended in the air and there was a guy in one of em. We get info on the big fort the orcs have taken over and we proceed to make a plan of action to free the potential prisoners inside and to loot the armory.\n\nBefore we go the Rogue decides to look for poisonous plants and mixes up a powder that causes Con Damage. \n\nHe gets over and  tells the Kobold to poison the water supply when I mention its kind of useless to do it if we are raiding it the same day. Eventually after like an hour of talking over the plan it came to we would poison the well with three doses of his con damage poison which is stronger when ingested. \n\nBut I added in couldn't we also ruin the water with some Zombie Flesh?(Evil cleric had fell animate and animated 2 zombies so far)So the rogue made powdered zombie flesh to poison the water with. Also instead of 2 zombies we now have a zombie human and a skeletal orc. (Later on we picked up another putrefying corpse we tied to the back of the carriage)\n\n\nSo we ended on the fact that we poisoned a well with zombie flesh and a ingested poison  and are going to destroy a forts water supply so the orcs have to go a mile out to get water. I can't wait for next week.\n\nAlso yes it is an evil party.\n\nOur original plan was to have the Kobold glide into the armory steal all their gear while we freed the prisoners via a secret entrance and armed them. But poisoning a entire fortress of orcs seemed like the better thing to do.\n\n\nAlso the carriage was stolen if you are wondering how a kobold and a evil cleric had the funds for it.",

Krug has 19 STR and 6 INT, when dave is in control, those two switch.\n\nOH THE MAYHEM.\n\nI wont bore you with the details of the many sessions, but here's the highlights.\n\n\nKrug once hit a man with a woodsmans axe so hard he bifurcated him.\n\nThe rogue wanted to search him\n\nDm \" you find half a steel helmet, half a steel platebody, one steel greave and one boot.\"\n\nKrug stole his boots and wore them for bracers.\n\nKrug once stole a goat from a farmer, after the party talks the guards out of trying to separate them, the goat was named petey, and he carried some loot for us.\n\nLater petey turned out to be a shapeshifitng demon that, due to krugs undying loyalty to his little buddy, stayed with the party.\n\nOh, and krug stole the farmers shoes.\n\n\nThe party was trying to negotiate to have a cleric come with them on a dangerous raid.\n\nIt was going so well until krug Kool-aid man's it right through the church wall and wrecks half the place, while holding a crate of boots.\n\nThat he stole from the town guards.\n\nDuring a fight with a necromancer meant to be our BBEG, krug grabs two of his zombie thralls, and wielding them like nunchuks proceeds to put an absolute beat down on the BBEG to the point that he had to plane shift out.\n\nOh, and krug stole his shoes too.\n\n\nKrug by now wore a viking style helmet, only with shoes hanging from the horns.\n\nOnce when dave was in control he gave a pair to a traveling merchant in exchange for some rope the party needed.\n\nMinutes later when krug was back, he was distraught at his own shoes, and to punish dave he headbutted a tree.\n\nthe RNG gods were with me this day, for a NAT 20 on headbutting the tree causes it to go crashing down, and reveals the gnome that was hiding in it, spying on us.\n\nWe later met that merchant at a town, and krug got his shoes back, after punching the merchants bodyguard so had he flew through a window and got up, and his helmet was now backwards.\n\nAnd, once in a fight for the party's lives in an area battle with a lion, and two gladiators, krug decides to slap the lion on the nose while screaming \"BAD KITTY\"\n\none thing led to another and soon krug was riding the lion at the gladiators, swinging a massive maul, and yelling the meow mix song.\n\nIt took 3 hours ingame to separate him and the lion.\n\nOnce, dave was in control, the party were guests of a local nobleman, who was charmed at how, for being a half orc, krug was so intelligent.\n\nUntil krug came back in control.\n\nBy the time we left, we were wanted in yet another city, the mansion was burning, the rogue had made off with most of the valuables and krug had his most fancy pair of shoes yet hanging on the horns of his helmet.\n\n\nKrug is now a paladin of the gods Gork and Mork (Imported from warhammer 40k)\n\nhe regularly makes offerings of shoes at their altar.\n",

        "text": "I'm mastering an Ascension level Play By Forum campaign on an Italian forum where several Inquisitors, a battleforce of the Divine Light of Sollex and (why the fuck not?) the  Ork Warlord Ghenghiz Grimtoof are stranded on the desert planet Klybo, competing to find a motherfuckin' Imperator Class Titan that had been \"forgotten\" there since the Horus Heresy.\nThey all know the Titan is on the planet, but no one knows exactly where: to complicate the things, the planet has been abandoned 50 years before because the mining operation were no more profitable, and those poor bastard that lived there were left behind to die of thirst while the Adepta withdrawed (technically, the population was owned by a Rogue Trader that decided not to spend money on taking the serfs away).\n\nLast detail: a big warp storm ex machina is cutting the subsector away for 5 years, to avoid the player sitting on their ass in orbit while an army of conscripts shakes down the planet.\n\nHowever, point is: every force on the field is pretty much willing to kill for an Emperor Clas Titan.\n\nStraight forward: Ultra Puritan Lord Inquisitor Theodore Corvus, one of the main opponents, managed to strike a bargain with the Black Templars, recruiting a small force of them. \nThe Astartes strike the players while they are traveling on a Maglev Train they managed to fix: the Space Marine attack the moving train with a StormRaven, dropping ground forces on it, trying to capture the Inquisitor and the Interrogator alive. \n\"Holy shit!\" metaphorically says the Inquisitor. \"Flight Marshall Manfred Von Richtofen: we need air support! Do you think you can take off with the moving train?\"\n\"Piece of cake! I fucking maxed my piloting skills, I have exactly one role in this game.\"\nSo our pilot runs to his personal Vulture, jumps in and takes off without much problems, before starting to engage a very scenographic battle with the StormRaven. \n\"I shoot one Hellstrike missile!\" He announces.\n\"Uh, man, the Hellstrike is an Air to Surface weapon, and the StromRaven is flying...\"\n\"Doesn't matter! Fire!\"\nI roll the die with a -20 malus: *79* (In a D100 system, the higher the worse. 79 is pretty much bad)\nThe missile hits the first cart of the train, destroying the superstructure and damaging the coolant system, forcing the poor Sage of the group to climb on the side of a speeding train to avoid the failure of the levitative system.\nNext turn:\n\"I fire another missile!\" announces the pilot.\nIn the notice board of the Play By Forum, all the other players don't really know what the fuck.\n\"...Seriously?\" I ask.\n\"YEEEEEEES!\" he answers with enthusiasm. \n97 on the throw: the missile strikes the side of the Leman Russ loaded on the train, that was kind of holding the Astartes at bay, stunning the crew and injuring the Interrogator. \nThe StormRaven, mercyfully, decides to remove the flying menace from the skies, hammering it with automatic fire and making it fall.\n\"I try to land on the train!\" Announces the brave Manfred.\n\"No please don't!\" Exclaims the inquisitor in the notice board, seeing how it was going to end. \"Land in the desert: we mark your position and come to get you later!\"\n\"Trust me!\" says the Pilot, before crashing in the middle of the train, leveling a cart and slaughtering a dozen of allied Death Korps of Krieg.\n\nThe player, at the end, are able to push the marines back (they were mostly neophytes), and the Inquisitor (probably the most merciful Inquisitor of the fucking whole Calixis Sector) sentences him to 50 lashes. \n\nFast forward: after a few months, after a sabotage of the Mechanicus forces that destroyed pretty much all the fuel reserves of the expedition, the group splits: the Inquisitor takes half of them take the Ore Seeker, a huge moving mining base and heads North to find some underground oil field, while the Interrogator picks some stormtroopers and head south. His mission? When 50 years before the planet was abandoned, a Mechanicus Magos decided to stay, thinking that there was something hidden on the planet. \nNowdays, the Magos is on a oil rig complex, surrounded by several houndred workers (or, most likely, the sons and daughters of the original serfs): there they can find water, fish, energy... not a bad base, we could say. \n\nAs I say, the whole expedition is running on fumes, so they take a Valkyrie, load it with all the airplane-grade fuel that is left, and they head south. Guess who is the pilot?\n\nYep, our Manfred drives the Interrogator to the oil rig complex... only to find it surrounded by thousands of orks, waiting along the coastline, one kilometer away, and building ships to reach the 'humies. \nNot wanting to meet their new green neighbours, the inhabitants of the rigs converted the powerful hydrants in flamethrowers, creating a big wall of fire to keep the orks at bay, while several missile launcher armed men stand ready in case of emergency.\n\nThere are three platform: an oil extractor, a gas extractor and a refinery, all connected via long bridges and catwalks. \n\nThe Valkyrie lands on the refinery landing pad, and the Interrogator leaves Manfred with the flyer, escorted by a single stormtrooper. The population doesn't seem hostile, so he thinks that the situation is pretty much under control, severely underestimating the fuck-up-factor of the pilot. \nThe magos seems to be on another platform, so the Interrogator leaves the refinery.\n\nI, somehow being a sadistic puppet master, tell Manfred: \"Passing a perception test, you notice a fuel pump on the landing pad, connected to a prometheum tank.\"\nLiterally seconds later, he answers that he starts refueling the flyer. \nOne worker, pissed off by the initiative, asks him what the fuck is he doing with their fuel. \nNow, in Manfred's defense, he tried to roll a fellowship test, but he failed; the pissed off man quickly becomes a pissed off mob, but they are more severely annoyed than in lynching mood. \nThe answer of our hero? Taking out his sidearm and kneecapping the man. \n\nNOW the mob is in lynching mood, and hard objects start to rain on the Flight Marshall, the Valkyrie and the poor stormtrooper busy wondering what he did to piss off the Emperor so much. \nPanicking, Manfred makes his (long awaited, on my part) masterpiece: he jumps on the flyer, kickstarts it, and takes off.\n\n\"Ok, Manfred.\" I write, smiling sadistically, while facepalms start falling all around the forum. \"Did you forget anything? Did you adjust the mirror? Tie your seatbelt? Unplug the motherfucking fuel sleeve?\"\nNow, remember that two things: \n1) these rigs didn't have proper maintenance for 50 years \nand\n2) the fire extinguishing system (or, at least, a substantial part of it) is spewing FUEL.\n\n(Listening the Fallout 3 soundtrack song 'I don't want to set the world on fire' may or may not improve your reading experience)\n\nThe fuel pipe is ripped open by the sudden take off, and prometheum starts to spew on the landing platform, before being immediately set on fire by the Valkyrie's jets. \nA raging fire starts burning, before quickly reaching the fuel tank: the explosion shakes the platform, almost downing the Valkyrie, so bright to be visible through the Interrogator's facepalm. Flaming debris start falling on the platform, starting many fires, while on the coastline the orks cheer enthusiastically, always happy to see stuff explode.\n\nKeeping control of the flyer (never said he is a bad pilot: he is just a bad at choiche making), Manfred lands on the oil rig's roof, reconverted to garden to grow food, but nobody actually cares, because every living person is now busy looking at the now burning platform, and a small crowd has formed near the landing zone.\n\"Oh God Emperor!\" Pleads him a woman. \"Please, my son is on that platform! That people needs help! Use your vehicle to help evacuating!\"\nThis time Manfred doesn't even need a test: \"Fuck them!\" He says while baffled players start seriously wondering if he is not an undercover caos cultist vowed to cause as much damage as possible to their expedition.\n\"They tried to kill me! They can die burning!\" he yells in anger. \nNeedless to say, a second lynching mob forms in seconds, demanding him to rescue their relatives and friends.\n\"Throw a grenade.\" He orders to the Stormtrooper, while he starts firing on the crowd himself. The soldier, being a (duh) stormtrooper, obeys, throwing a frag in the middle of the screaming people, making a carnage. \nOr, maybe, I should say a 'Karmage': one of the missile launcher men, hearing the shots, arrives just in time to see several of his friends blown in pieces by gun toting, grenade throwing psychos, so he braces the heavy weapon and fires, obliterating the Valkyrie and severely wounding both Manfred and the unlucky Stormtrooper.\n\nFlight Marshal Manfred Von Richtofen has immediatly been promoted by me \"Herald of Gork and Mork\" for his talent in wrecking everything he touches against everything foolish enough to stand in his way. Warlord Ghenghiz Grimtoof would be proud. \n\nNow, the actual situation (we are still playing) is the following: the Interrogator is stranded on an oil rig, surrounded by people that are growing more and more hostile as the tales of what happened spreads, while they are several thousand kilometers of desert and three thousand orks away from the base, with their only flying vehicle destroyed and no hope to get rescued by the Inquisitor. \n",

The battle plan was pretty strategic, the main point being that the archer would down a potion of fly and provide aerial support. This made me grin from ear to ear, because guess who else had a potion of flying? \n\nThree rounds in I look to our archer and say \"make a grapple check\". He does. He fails. \"A ogre has flown out of the blue and grappled you. You're both plummeting to the ground at blinding speeds.\" He tries to break free, to no avail. Just as their about to hit the ogre whispers in his ear \"it's all ogre now\" (The entire table groaned). Then the ogre pile drives our archer into the ground and drops him into the negative. (He did stabilize, but was out for awhile) \n\nFor once **I** was the one making terrible one liners. \n\nEdit: About two sessions after this one Mr. Tibs fell unconscious for the last time. Got into a dog fight with a dragon and was hit to -60. ",

Basically, in this reality, it showed us what would happen if we failed to take down the BBEG (for those unfamiliar with the term, it means Big Bad Evil Guy). At the time, I was playing a Half-Elven Ranger and my friend Jason was playing a human barbarian. For brevity, we were tasked with liberating a city from the BBEG's rule. As a part of this, I want to use explosions. Why not right? So we got rope, lamp oil and barrels upon barrels of gunpowder. Through trickery (predominately the assistance of dragons letting us use invisibility) we were able to go throughout the city and plant these little hotcakes of explosives all around in order to cause the most chaos. After we finish placing the explosives, I take an arrow, light it on fire and shoot the now-covered in oil rope to start a fuse. As this happens, we are spotting and begin combat. After a few moments of combat, the explosives actually go off and rock the turn. As I notch an arrow to fire again, I look to the barbarian and tell them \"well, that went exactly as expected.\" then proceed to fire the arrow.\n\n\nThis just happens to remind me of the scene from Avengers where Hawkeye tells Black Widow that \"you and I remember Budapest very differently.\"",

He's ready for adventure. As we ask around the town looking for any info on things that need to be done we finally get a lead. While praying in a temple of Pelor, our cleric and paladin are approached by a priest who wants to know if we can help to restore a fallen temple. It was once a glorious temple that many came to see and worship. As it turns out a necromancer took over the area around the temple and has tainted it. He's destroyed the outside but Pelor has kept him out of the inside. To make sure Pelor's followers would avoid the temple he turned the area around the temple into a marshland. Now all kinds of beasts, undead, and monsters have made the swamp their home. They agree and the priest gives the cleric the ritual that she needs to perform to restore it. \n\nThis whole time Belin is working hard to learn more about weapon and armor smithing. He's learning to make better light armor and weapons. At this point it's nothing fancy. Just leather armor, daggers, and throwing axes. He sells some here and there to make a profit. He then takes all he's made and buys more supplies. Rope, torches, rations, and ect. Our halfling rogue is making money too but in a less honest way. The paladin and cleric round up the party and tell them the mission and ask us for help. We all say yes and the party decides to wait for a day and then set out for the marsh. \n\nHere is where things took a turn for the funny. So a funny thing about our paladin is that he ended losing his sheath for his sword at some point. I'm trying so hard but can't remember which fight it was in. He pulled the sword and sheath out and, with sword in one hand and sheath in the other, flung his sheath off. He did it to look cool but then never went to get it back. So the rest of the journey he had to hold it or tuck it in his belt.(Our DM would make him roll percentile to see if it cut the belt.) So while we were in the city he happened to walk by a card game. The dealer asks if he'd like to play. He responded with \"Only if I can win a sheath for my sword.\" The deal assures him that he has a sheath that will fit the long sword. He sits down and plays a few hands and ends up winning his sheath. After he wins he's so excited that he goes to tell the cleric. As he walks into the temple he feels this terrible feeling wash over him. Pelor is furious with him. To be a lawful good paladin of Pelor and to unlawfully gamble... lets just say he lost his levels of paladin. The DM tells him that he can earn them back but it'll be a hard road. He says restoring the temple will do it. The paladin decides that he's messed up terribly and wants to make it up to Pelor by giving up his life to atone. So what does he do? Comes and finds his good friend Belin the PC slayer. He explains to Belin what happened and asks for Belins help. To Belin dying with honor is glorious and agrees to help. They leave the city (I decided it would freak people out to see a paladin cut down in the streets.) and the paladin says some prayers. Afterwords Belin cuts off his head and burns his body like a warrior. As you can guess the paladins player didn't want to try to take a no class npc on an adventure. Silly but it's not my call. \n\nThe cleric talks to the priest about the paladin and asks if she knows were we might find another to replace him. She suggests the tavern. We go and look for the best brawler there. It's a dragonborn that fights with a hammer and shield. (Paladin's player's new/current character.) Belin is naturally not a fan of picking someone in a pointless bar brawl. However the dragonborn recognizes Belin and knows of his deeds. After a little bit of fan-girling over Belin he is welcomed into the party. Now our party finally makes their way to the temple.\n\nOn the road to the temple we see many things. A gazebo were it looks like someone was sacrificed. Due to a blood stained table. Dead bodies in the marshes. Bones are on pathway and such. We finally make it to the temple and it's completely in shambles. The doors are barricaded from the inside and it takes a while but we finally get it opened and get inside. However we broke the barricade to get in and now the doors are open. We all look around trying to find the items the cleric needs for the ritual. While looking around Belin sees something on the ceiling. It's sparkling and shining. Belin pulls out his sword and touches it to see what it is. It's a mirror... and it falls. It hits me and breaks. DM now informs me that I have a -1 to all rolls involving a D20 cause of bad luck. Remove curse will get rid of it tho. Now the party is laughing at me calling Belin the Unlucky. About that time our monk hears shambling coming from outside and we turn to see a huge army of skeletons. As you would come to expect Belin posts up in the door way and prepares for a huge battle. The Dragonborn takes the spot next to me and readies his weapons too. The monk, rogue, and cleric are trying hard to find the things and get it all together for the ritual. Belin tells Kord that he's gonna destroy a whole lot of stuff and to watch carefully. It's at this time that Belin rages out and starts killing the ever loving crap out some skeletons. Every swing one is dying. The Dragonborn is complaining about not getting to hit anything. They finally finish the ritual and unexpectedly a divine avatar of Pelor appears and lays waste to army of skeletons. Killing all of them. The clouds part and the sun shines on the marsh. As if by magic the swamp area turns into a grassy field and the temple is restored. The cleric thanks the avatar. Meanwhile Belin is pissed. Looks to the avatar and says \"I was doing just fine without you. Next time you take my kill, I'll kill you. God or not.\" The avatar leaves without saying or doing anything else. My DM asks me if I'm trying to piss of the gods or what? I was like \"hell I'm pretty sure Kord is either highly impressed or at least amused.\" DM agrees. We leave and head back to town.\n\nWe returned to town lootless and I know most would be disappointed but Belin was perfectly happy with just the killing. When we get back to the town and inform the priest of what happened she gave us an amazing gift. There is a town not far from us called Azeroth or the town of heroes. (Can you tell our DM's favorite game?) Anyway the priest gives us a voucher to enter the town. Turns out they only let heroes or those that have completed heroic deeds enter the town. Now we head out on our way to Azeroth. Best quest reward so far. ",

        "text": "So we were starting a new campaign and we had a  new player. He played the basic LG paladin with one difference: This guy must have spent HOURS on his backstory. It was all centered around how he was trying to honor his wife who was murdered in a bandit attack and save his ailing daughter, who had an infection that just wouldn't go away, with enough devotion to good, hoping the gods would hear his pleas or something.\n\nAll quite emotional, really.\n\nSo at the beginning of the campaign they angered a dread god, who was known to cause madness and warp reality (the BBEG, of course). So throughout the campaign I would subtly bring back up his daughter and wife, and he dutifully sent back presents and money for her, little trinkets and postcards to keep her happy while he was gone. At the end of this campaign, we meet up with the BBEG, and begin to fight. \n\nWell, skipping back a month or so, upon reading this out I got an idea. A marvelously, wonderfully, evil idea. I surreptitiously handed out cards to the other three players reading \"The paladin [player name] has no living family. They were all killed long ago.\" and told them to keep them. Flashing forward, the BBEG uses \"Remove Curse\" on the party, and I tell the players to hand their cards to the poor, delusional soul. He was heartbroken. This guy poured his life into this story, and role-played it perfectly. \n\nI'm happy to report he is now a level 17 Blackguard, sworn to destroy all gods. ",

The party has been on their heels this entire time throwing wrenches in as many plans as they can. This week was the final battle, an invasion on the strong hold city. \n\nNear the end of the battle, all the enemy forces have amassed inside the city to face off against the last few defenders of the town. The orc general stops everything, looks into the crowd, and says \"send me the fucker who killed my brother. I want to kill him myself.\" Now, the party is out of spells, so the only one with a weapon is sent out. The new kid. This player has only played one session with us before, and never done table tops before this. \n\nAs I look over the stat block for the enemy I realize something. Both him and the PC are the same level and have the same feats. The only difference between them is the NPC has health potions and an extra 10 HP. \n\nTo say it was a hard match is an understatement. It was the first truly fair fight I've seen in DND outside of PVP. During the entire thing both armies have stopped fighting and crowded around, cheering when their champion lands a blow. The PC even had some great RP grandstanding. \n\nFinally, many rounds later, the PC crits and kills the orc general. The human army cheers and envelops him as they push back the demoralized orc army. The city is saved. \n\n\nNow that the party is famous I need to write up some groupies and fanboys. \n\n",
