        "text": "So I got into a discussion with a fellow student with aspirations to become a writer and to become masters student in English Lit. I start probing their mind just to see what's veiled in there and all of a sudden we get into a discussion about William Faulkner and his work. She immediately stated that his work is \"pretentious\" and at that moment I was just completely baffled. This is akin to Nabokov dismissing his *oeuvre* as \"corncobby chronicles\" which is albeit hilarious, but still-- flouting Faulkner seems to be an ignorant position for one to take.\n\nWorks such as \"The Sound and the Fury\" tackle REAL problems such as the decline of the South, and his masterpiece \"Absalom, Absalom!\" plays with fire, talking about miscegenation as well as the degradation of southern morals which lead to the defeat of the South in the Civil War. And that's just one part. We aren't even talking about the vastly complicated structures and elements used in his books. Even if you dislike *The Sound and the Fury,* any true student of literature can appreciate Benjy's stream of consciousness narrative and its originality. Even if you dislike *Absalom, Absalom!* you can definitely admire the complicated and jarring structure and how the story unravels the story of the enigmatic Thomas Sutpen like a myth or a legend.\n\nI don't understand how someone who is an aspiring writer can just simply dismiss such an acclaimed author and their accomplishments. There is a difference between \"liking a book\" and acknowledging a book's significance, literary impact, and its uniqueness. Any thoughts on this? Is this a usual thing that comes up with students and literary giants like Faulkner?",

        "author": "Yamini1976",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/8x1ztf/ts_eliots_the_wasteland/",
        "text": "Hi All,\n\nI accepted my friend’s challenge to read and understand Eliot’s obscure poem ‘The Waste Land’. It was hard work initially with so many multiple allusions but I persevered and in the process learnt many new ideas.\n\nI thought I would summarize my understanding of this poem incomplete though it is and share it so all of you can pitch in and help understand it better and maybe even encourage others to give the poem a try!\n\nEliot’s ‘The Waste Land’ as a title and symbol refers to the idea of a dry and sterile wasteland as a metaphor for a Europe devastated by war, and desperate for spiritual replenishment; but depleted of the cultural tools necessary for renewal.\n\nEliot uses the ‘Mythical method’ and the past as a trope to deploy Pagan and Christian myths from Frazer’s ‘The Golden Bough.’ Eliot also draws on the Fisher King from the Grail Legend in Weston's ‘From Ritual to Romance. The wounded Fisher King’s disease causes the wasteland, a fallen world in need of redemption; that is the central image of the poem.\n \nThe poem’s epigraph introduces the ancient prophetess Sibyl of Cumae who guided Aeneas through Hades. The image of Hades combined with her utterance of a death wish introduces death as the poem’s leitmotif.\n\nEliot employs the poetic technique of ‘Montage-Imagism,’ \"heap of broken images\" to symbolically represent the themes of barrenness, decay and death. Eliot also employs ‘Heteroglossia’ to present multiple voices in quick succession to convey the motif of moral degeneration.\n\nThe blind hermaphroditic prophet Tiresias’s dual voices (masculine and feminine) act as a guide through the poem. The \"visionary\" Tiresias provides an insight into people, places and events and what Tiresias “sees” is in fact the substance of the poem.\n\nThe first section, “THE BURIAL OF THE DEAD:” references the burial service in the Anglican Church. “April is the cruellest month” as the celebration of spring as a time of natural renewal is not mirrored in human souls.\n\nThe imagery of dryness in the wasteland, “dry stone no sound of water” is a central motif that defines the spiritual and social aridity of the time.\n\nThe second section, “A GAME OF CHESS:” explores the theme of sexual aridity in the social world of the wasteland, as a wealthy couple go through the motions of a depleted relationship; their sexual malaise symbolized by the mechanics of a chess game.\n\t\nTwo cockney women in an East-side pub discuss Lil’s barren sexuality and further the theme. The barman’s call for closing, “HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME” is seemingly an advent call for change.\n\nThe third section, “THE FIRE SERMON:” refers to Buddha’s sermon against the fires of lust and explores the connection between sexuality and religion. \n\nTiresias in his androgynous mode reflects on both the male and female aspects of the modern-day affair, between a seedy clerk who engages a tired typist in a sexual liaison that she neither desires nor resists. At the completion of the meaningless, mechanical coupling, the typist is “glad its over.”\n\nThe fourth section, “DEATH BY WATER:” links water with death in the brief elegiac lyrics to Phlebas, the drowned Phoenician sailor. Phlebas belongs to an extinct race, but the physical reality of death and inevitable decay is universal and relevant even today.\n\nThe final section, “WHAT THE THUNDER SAID:” depicts the world as a wasteland awaiting redemption. A “damp gust” brings rain and Prajapati, God of Thunder utters \"Da\" which is interpreted variously by the residents of Triloka (three worlds from Hindu mythology)\n\nMen, the residents of Martyalok (earth) interpret “Da” as \"Datta\" which means \"give\" as they are naturally avaricious hoarders who would benefit from giving in charity.\n\nAsuras, the residents of Narkalok (hell) interpret “Da” as “Dayadhvam” which means “be merciful” as they are naturally cruel and would benefit if their anger was tempered by mercy.\n\nCelestials, the residents of Swargalok (heaven) interpret “Da” as “Damyata” which means “restrain yourself” as they are lotus eaters who would benefit if their sensual pleasures were tempered by restraint.\n\nThe rain combined with the profoundly spiritual moment of communication between men and God suggests new beginnings, a washing away of sin, and hope for the return of spirituality to modern life.\n\nThe poem ends with an Upanishadic ‘Shanti Mantra,’ “Shantih shantih shantih,\" uttered thrice so as to calm and remove obstacles in three realms and bless humanity with ‘The peace which passeth all understanding.’ \n\n\n",

        "text": "Hi all,\n\nI first read “The Old Man and the Sea” at college. I find it takes on more profound meaning every time I re-read it. This is my latest take on the novella.\n\nHemingway’s “The Old Man and the Sea”, is an epic account of man’s struggle against the forces of nature. It portrays the contest between power and patience in an elemental fight wherein patience triumphs eventually.\n\nThe first paragraph emphasizes Santiago's apparent lack of material success, but we learn later that he possesses ample spiritual success. This triumph of indefatigable spirit over exhaustible material resources is an important theme of the novella.\n\nHemingway’s descriptive degradation of Santiago continues with details of his old, worn body, however \"Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color as the sea and were cheerful and undefeated\". \n\nSantiago's eye color foreshadows Hemingway's increasingly explicit likening of Santiago to the sea, suggesting an analogy between Santiago's indomitable spirit and the sea's boundless strength. Therefore, the title “The Old Man and the Sea” is fitting and justified.\n\nSantiago had gone eighty four days now without taking a fish, hence, his young apprentice Manolin has been forbidden by his parents to sail with the old man. \n\nManolin has been ordered to fish with more successful fishermen as \"the old man was now and definitely salao, which is the worst form of unlucky\". This sentence proclaims one of the novella's themes, the heroic struggle against unchangeable fate. \n\nManolin was however dedicated to the old man, \"The old man had taught the boy to fish and the boy loved him\". Despite the clear hierarchy of this teacher/student relationship, Santiago stresses his equality with the boy. When Manolin asks to buy the old man a beer, he replies, \"Why not? ... Between fisherman\".\n\nManolin discusses American baseball with Santiago; the valorizing references to the “great DiMaggio” and his struggle to play with a bone spur in his heel are a transparent reference to another heroic archetype, Achilles. \n\nOn the eighty fifth day, Santiago sets out alone, taking his skiff far onto the Gulf Stream, confident that his unlucky streak is near its end.  When out at sea, he longs for company; “No one should be alone in their old age” \n\nSantiago, a true Code Hero knows that as he ages, he is getting closer to death every day. \n\nIronically, the Code Hero can also be afraid of the dark, as it symbolizes the void/ nothingness “Nada” that comes with death.\n\nThe phrase, “Hemingway Code Hero” originated with scholar Philip Young. Here, \"Code\" means a set of rules or guidelines for conduct which dictate that the hero act honorably in the midst of what will be a losing battle. \n\nThe phrase \"Grace under Pressure\" is used to describe the conduct of the Code Hero. \n\nHemingway portrays Santiago as a true Code Hero who displays immense grace while under the pressure of catching his adversary, the marlin.\n\nOn his return journey Santiago armed with only a short knife, fights and kills four man-eating sharks that bombard him at night. \n\nFinally, Santiago reaches the shore before dawn with the fish’s skeleton still attached to his boat. \n\nA worried Manolin cries upon finding the old man safe asleep and when he wakes, they promise to fish together once again. \n\nSantiago's childlike dream of playful lions (symbols of male strength and virility) imply the coming of Santiago's second youth.\n\nHemingway writes, \"He (Santiago) was too simple to wonder when he had attained humility”. Hemingway qualifies that humility was “not disgraceful” and “it carried no loss of true pride”. Thus, humility and the acceptance of obligation are in fact marks of manhood. \n\nThe novella portrays the Hemingway Code Hero to his fullest potential as Santiago does not forsake the principle of courage but says, “A man may be destroyed but not defeated.”\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "I'm an English major, hoping to potentially become a professor way down the road, and I was considering the changing understanding of what is and isn't literature. Ten years from now, I expect to see some new additions to the pool of acceptable texts, maybe even some more modern pieces on college reading lists. Considering that many books that are now considered classics might one have been dismissed as trite, silly things, particularly early novels, before fiction became acceptable; I know Moby Dick in particular was torn apart by critics when it was released. Keeping that in mind, what sort of books that are currently seen as fads or maybe even just poplit, might eventually be taught in universities or considered classics?\n\nI, personally, hope to see fantasy and science fiction come more into the light, and children's books as well. Phillip Pullman's *His Dark Materials* trilogy has a lot of interesting ideas, and I've always been a fan of mature sounding child narrators giving their perspective on adult events. Given that *Huck Finn* was often considered children's lit, but is now often studied, I don't think it's out of the realm of imagination to consider that the YA and Juvenile genres might become more mainstream.  J.R.R. Tolkien's works are currently making the crossover, and many other fantasy books have begun to be more acceptable works of study as well, which I'm quite excited to see, as a lover of fantasy.\n\nObviously as a college student, I enjoyed a lot of YA novels, so I do wonder how popular series, like Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, the Hunger Games, and Ender's Game will stand the test of time. (Additionally, how does the cinematization of these series affect public perception of their worth?)\n\nCurrently, one of the modern books I've read that I think is most likely to make a lasting impression is Barbara Kingsolver's *Poisonwood Bible.* The prose is gorgeous to read, the characters are both archetypal and defy definition, and there seems to be a never ending well of thematic ideas and statements to be drawn from. I've written papers on the novel, but considering that I'm still in an undergraduate program, that doesn't say much.\n\nIn the vein of this, if newer books will eventually be deemed \"literature\", is the field of literature on a trajectory of infinite expansion? Now that the technology exists to preserve a work and the literature on it almost perpetually, content and analysis can only increase, especially if there's little to no culling of the \"list\" of what can be considered true literature. So far, there are few books that are removed from that list once they receive the title. Books fall out of favor, but very rarely are they deemed to be \"trash\" or unworthy once scholars and academics begin to analyze them. It almost seems that the concept of a work's literary worth is created once analysis takes place.\n\nI know an author's reputation can be tarnished, and their work may lose popularity, but does that necessarily negate something's status as a work to be remembered? I'm curious to hear others' ideas on this topic.\n\nTL;DR\n\nThe pool of literature is rather fickle, and many books weren't considered classics until long after their publication.\n\nPoisonwood Bible is a modern piece that shares a lot of the markers of good literature. What current works will endure the test of time and end up being recognized as excellent works of literature?\n\nCan the literary well increase infinitely? Assuming that something's status as \"literature\" is dependent upon critical analysis of it as a work, can the status of literature ever be stripped from a work?",

        "text": "Saul Bellow's pretty great. Author of The Adventures of Augie March, Herzog, Humboldt's Gift, etc. \n\nPost some passages from Bellow you enjoy, maybe it'll move some people to read him :-)\n\nFrom Humboldt's Gift, a little peacocking to start things off...\n\n\"The Boeing tore off through shawls of cloud, the hurtling moment of risk and death ended with a musical Bing! and we entered the peace and light above. My head lay back on the bib and bosom of the seat and when the Jack Daniel’s came I strained it through my irregular multicolored teeth, curling my forefinger over the top of the glass to hold back the big perforated ice cubes--they always put in too many. The thread of whisky burned pleasantly in the gullet and then my stomach, like the sun outside, began to glow, and the delight of freedom also began to expand within me… \n\nOnce in a while, I get shocked into upper wakefulness, I turn a corner, see the ocean, and my heart tips over with happiness--it feels so free! Then I have the idea that, as well as beholding, I can also be beheld from yonder and am not a discrete object but incorporated with the rest, with universal sapphire, purplish blue. For what is this sea, this atmosphere, doing within the eight-inch diameter of your skull? (I say nothing of the sun and the galaxy which are also there.) At the center of the beholder there must be space for the whole, and this nothing-space is not an empty nothing but a nothing reserved for everything. You can feel this nothing-everything capacity with ecstasy and this was what I actually felt in the jet. Sipping whisky, feeling the radiant heat that rose inside, I experienced a bliss that I knew perfectly well was not mad.\"\n\nFrom Herzog, where he visits his deceased father's house:\n\n\"After Howard Street he was in the city proper and knew his way. Leaving the Expressway at Montrose, he turned east and drove to his late father's house, a small two-story brick building, one of a row built from a single blueprint-the pitched roof, the cement staircase inset on the right side, the window boxes the length of the front-room windows, the lawn a fat mound of grass between the sidewalk and the foundation; along the curb, elms and those shabby cottonwoods with blackened, dusty, wrinkled bark, and leaves that turned very tough by midsummer. There were also certain flowers, peculiar to Chicago, crude, waxy things like red and purple crayon bits, in a special class of false-looking natural objects. These foolish plants touched Herzog because they were so graceless, so corny. He was reminded of his father's devotion to his garden, when old Herzog became a property owner toward the end of his life-how he squirted his flowers at evening with the hose and how rapt he looked, his lips quietly pleased and his straight nose relishing the odor of the soil. To right and left, as Herzog emerged from the rented hard-top, the sprinklers turned and danced, scattering bright drops, fizzing out iridescent veils. And this was the house in which Father Herzog had died a few years ago, on a summer night, sitting up in bed suddenly, saying, \"Ich shtarb!\"\n\nAnd then he died, and that vivid blood of his turned to soil, in all the shrunken passages of his body.\n\nAnd then the body, too-ah, God!- wastes away; and leaves its bones, and even the bones at last wear away and crumble to dust in that shallow place of deposit. And thus humanized, this planet in its galaxy of stars and worlds goes from void to void, infinitesimal, aching with its unrelated significance.\n\nUnrelated?\n\nHerzog, with one of his Jewish shrugs, whispered, \"Nu, maile...\n\nBe that as it may. In any case, here was his late father's house in which the widow lived, Moses' very ancient stepmother, quite alone in this small museum of the Herzogs...\"\n\nAnd here's a good piece on Bellow by James Woods: https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/apr/09/saulbellow\n\nAnyway, would love to hear your favorite passages, or any impressions, thoughts on the man, etc 🌈",

        "text": "If there's one thing that I could say about Julio Cortazar's novel *Hopscotch* it's that it's pretentious. If there were two things I could say I'd say it's pretentious and I love it. \n\nCortazar manages to hit perfect measures of obscurantist philosophizing and self-deprecating humor. It's not that Cortazar forgets, even for a moment, that his hero Horacio Oliveira is unbearably vague, intellectually dishonest and self-aggrandizing. His companions constantly berate him, they say all he does is throw words around. The women especially La Maga, Pola, and Talita are often exasperated by his useless tangents. Cortazar understands that Oliveira's maze of thoughts is a kind of...but his protagonist hates psychoanalysis. In fact, there's a lot of ways of thinking that Oliveira seems to hate, eleatic thinking, oneiromancy, Catholicism, platonism, all manner of fortune telling... It doesn't seem like Oliveira is interested in any type of cohesiveness or consistency. At times he's convinced the mysteries of the universe are all tied up in a gourd full of *mate* and his entire agonistic impulse is tied up in his distaste for *cafe con leche*. \n\nIf you're ever beginning to feel like this might be a waste of time, Cortazar agrees. The introduction says the last 99 chapters in his novel are expendable and can be skipped \"with a clean conscience.\" A joke or challenge? His tone makes it impossible to tell. So he forces you to bounce around the book like you would your memories in some predetermined pattern, he skips a chapter, and eventually he traps you in a recursive loop. \n\nThe result is a work of appalling originality something that asks you to join along in its own self-destruction and to go along, past the end, to the heaven square in Hopscotch, the kibbutz of desire, the Yggdrasil of blah blah blah blah. \n\nTLDR: It's good. \n\nP.S. The novel is meant to be played like any game but to what end? Cortazar gives us two ways to read the text, neither of them is satisfying, the way of the \"female-reader\" which consists of reading chapters 1-56 in order and the way of the \"accomplice reader\" which consists of hopping around starting from 73 and hitting every chapter at least once. The latter has been tragically simplified as the \"male-reader\" by critics who don't share Cortazar's disdain for simple binaries. There is a third way, the way in which the reader hops around as they see fit organizing the book into their own specific order (this is what I would argue constitutes a male reading.) \n\nIf the book's structure ultimately qualifies as a gimmick similar to shuffling a deck of cards and handing it to the reader to place back into order then it is at the very least an honest attempt to add layers of deception, illusion, and imagination to our spiritual ennui. If Oliveira eventually ends like Hamlet, wondering why he shouldn't just kill himself as he does at the window of the asylum, he does it dazzlingly with renewed energy, magic, and absurdity. ",
