What I wanted is, every changes on the Products table will be reflected on the local DB of each POS. The solution that I have in mind is,the POS will run a command to check for new or updated data and update its local DB, connection between the two will be via web service running on remote server(if possible). Second option is to run a DB replication on product table. \n\nI wanted to localized the products table so that if anything goes wrong with the server or network related issues, the POS will still run. \n\nAre there any better way of doing this?

        "text": "So I am in the process of starting to build a management system. Think something like workflow automation for industries. And there are gonna be lots of components to it, it's going to be targeted at places with different needs so I'm taking a micro-service architecture approach. Basically different components work with each other, and based on specific company requirements I could modify only those parts.\n\nThis is the first time I am building something like this on my own. I am working with someone who works in these kinds of industries and they're giving all these ideas for stuff they would love to see in the system and so I also have people ready to try the product and give feedback. So I need to be ready with the MVP soon. But the thing I'm confused is how do I start managing this?\n\nCurrently I am the only programmer and we will be hiring soon, but while I start building the basic product, how do I start documenting stuff? There are different manufacturing pipelines in this industry(for example a manufacturing company), and lots of complicated stuff. So currently I am learning a lot about how they work, I'm writing it out all on a word document which I know will soon get bloated with designs and features. Would be nice if there was a software to write these stuff down in parts maybe. So if I need to change one part of a feature, it'd easily change my overall control flow diagrams.\n\nAlso do they teach this stuff in software development classes? I recently only finished my freshmen year of computer science, and am doing a internship right now with a tech company. I am trying to absorb as much as  I can but these companies have very complicated management and I can't reason how everything is getting done here. And I see so much legacy stuff going on, and even huge systems being built on top of one person's work, and then the design decisions made for that underlying structure starts to affect us, but nothing we can do about the monolith.\n\nMy previous work experience includes being a full stack developer. I worked on two projects. But I had a manager who'd make the requirements and I built the system. And those weren't distributed, would be hosted in one place and work with one database. It was all fairly simple and the only documentation needed were for the rest apis.\n\nBut this new project will surely be complex, will have to be reliable, and needs to be properly started. I probably shouldn't worry about this and focus on making the MVP but I want to take my time with this project and take a systematic approach. I also want to get more experience with software architecture. Since I don't have an actual deadline I want to learn as much I can working on this. So any resources and recommendations(books, videos, articles) would be very much be appreciated.",

        "text": "I'm terribly sorry if I put this in the wrong place but I desperately need to know a few things from knowledgeable people with real world experience in the industry. I am extremely interested in cyber security and software engineering.  I'm currently weighing my options between a specialized tech school vs. a 4 year degree in computer science. \n\nI have spoken to a guy working at a sales capacity selling software solutions to different companies and he told me about people he's done business with at major companies that have only completed IT two year degrees but head security for major companies like Honda.  So what are the advantages of the 4 year bachelors degrees? \n\nWhat's are the disadvantages of a two year degree? Would I be able to compete in cyber security only having two year specialized knowledge or would I consistently be restrained to the \"minor leagues.\" \n\nI wouldn't bother asking these questions but most all the articles about these topics are written by people that are naturally bias given their chosen 2 or 4 year path. I am especially curious as I know a lot of people are self taught and do just fine as well. \n\nI'm typically a fairly extroverted person but with a deep seeded curiosity about how the finer details of cyber security work. Therefore my dream as of now is to fully understand cyber security that would not only quench my thirst for learning it but would make me a more effective sales person if I land myself in a position to represent a company. Heading or representing a red team sounds heavenly and I'm dying to hear from y'all. \n\nThank you in advance and again I apologize if this is inappropriate for this sub. ",

The document DB solution would be to store key words and their frequencies as a key-value array, and each indexed document would be a document in the database. The RDBMS solution would be to store document titles, URIs, and other simple information in a table, and to store keywords in another table, with each row containing a document ID, the key word or phrase, and the frequency. \n\nThere's a lot of redundancy in both solutions. My primary concern is speed. Size and scalability shouldn't be an issue for this kind of data, I don't think, but advice about that would be appreciated as well.",
