I’ve been reading sculpting in time by Andrei Tarkovsky and he talks about not adding symbolism in and just letting films be an observation of life. I mean how could I could that but also add surrealism in and not add unnecessary symbolism and instead just have a flow on life and dreams?",

        "text": " \n\nContempt for the bourgeoisie is the driving force behind a wide range of twentieth-century art. Leslie Stevens’ *Private Property* is a prime example. It was released in 1960, the same year as Hitchcock’s [**Psycho**](https://filmofileshideout.com/archives/three-films-that-keep-coming-up-the-wizard-of-oz-psycho-and-deepthroat/). In fact, there is a sardonic little nod to Alfred in *Private Property* when the heroine, Ann, meets her antagonist, Duke. Duke pretends to be a landscaper looking for the Hitchcock family home. After Ann tells him he has the wrong house, she closes the door and repeats “Hitchcock?”, as if it has some strange significance.\n\n*Psycho* was infamous for having shocked the nation. As an independent film, *Private Property* had a much smaller distribution, but it shocked its audiences as well. So much so that the National Legion of Decency (a Catholic organization) condemned it. Following the Christians' lead, the Motion Picture Production Code board denied the film their seal of approval. As a result, the distributor went out of business and the film was thought to be lost, but resurfaced in 2016.\n\n*Private Property* revolves around the statuesque heroine played by Kate Manx. It is her repressed sexual desire that drives the film and creates an opportunity for Duke, a drifter, to slip into her carefully manicured world of quiet desperation. There are many books and movies that use this somewhat problematic premise. The fundamental idea is that female sexuality is dangerous. It is a Pandora’s box that leads to chaos.\n\nThis idea has been a theme in cinema since the beginning, with films like Georg Wilhelm Pabst’s *Pandora’s Box* or F. W, Murnau’s [**Nosferatu**](https://filmofileshideout.com/archives/favorite-scenes-%E2%84%961-nosferatu/)*. Nosferatu* can be seen as a story of a woman, Ellen, who is married to a sexually naïve husband, Hutter. Ellen is a vulnerable target for the vampire’s machinations because she craves the heat of passion. Her passion makes her vulnerable, but conversely, gives her the strength and courage to trap and kill the vampire. She succeeds where the immature and impotent Hutter failed. This same dynamic is replayed in *Private Property,* but in the suburbs of Los Angeles, with a drifter instead of a vampire. \n\nThis idea of the sexually potent female can empower women, while simultaneously warning all of us that opening the door to that power will end badly. Séverine Serizy in *Belle de Jour* is exhilarated by the depravity of her secret profession, but eventually, she is punished. Ultimately, it is her innocent husband who pays the price. His money and affluence could not save him from the anarchic forces of his wife’s libido.\n\n In *Belle de Jour,* Séverine dreams of degrading sadomasochistic encounters. Buñuel actually shows us her fantasies. *Private Property* is not quite as bold, but the same themes are implied. After an innocent meeting between Anne and Duke, Ann finds that Duke has forgotten his leather belt behind. She picks it up, fondles the leather, and then slips the belt around her neck, buckling it tight. It is a potent gesture, especially for 1960. \n\n Aside from BDSM symbolism, the belt is also a symbol of ownership, like a dog collar or a slave collar. The promotional poster for the movie makes clear that the title, *Private Property,* is not just a reference to the materialism of the suburbs, but to Ann herself. In the poster below, it is her body that is labeled, as if it was owned. There are three men in the film, two of whom certainly treat her like a piece of property. The upstanding, socially mobile husband sees her only as a sexless decoration. It’s as if she came with the house, like a matched set of furniture. She’s a trophy that every respectable man needs.  \n\n Duke sees her only as prey to toy with, like a cat with a mouse. Duke demonstrates his potency and superiority by manipulating Ann while Duke’s buddy, Boots, watches from a window. \n\nThe only man who does not treat her like an object is Boots. He is a bit like George from Steinbeck’s *Of Mice and Men*. He is “slow” and simple, but not only does he have a moral compass, he also has a sense of compassion that the other two men lack.\n\nThe film is less about sex and more about power and class. Sex is just used to stir the pot. The heart of the film is watching Duke easily predict and manipulate the happy bourgeois couple. Duke becomes a kind of noir-esque critic of the American middle class. Duke explains to Boots that he can tell that the couple is married because they watch TV together.\n\nWhat Duke finds contemptible about the bourgeoisie is not that they are rich, but that they have forced themselves to settle for a pacified, hollow dream. They have made a deal with the Devil. They will convince themselves that swimming pools and expensive cars are what they want, and that getting them will make them happy. \n\nDuke sees through this pathetic bargain and sees that it is made, as Sartre would have put it, in “bad faith.” Sartre describes humanity as fundamentally afraid of our own freedom. Deep down, we know we are free to do anything we desire, but we come to realize that with this freedom comes responsibility. If we are truly free, then we are solely responsible for the nature and conditions of our lives. We are the sole author of our fate. Sartre believed that we run from this fact by acting in “bad faith”, meaning we seek ways to artificially limit ourselves and blame the false limits for making us unhappy. We attribute our malaise to a long commute, a petty boss, or a stain on our brand-new couch, instead of facing our own power and responsibility. \n\nIn *Private Property*, this facade is undone by the primacy of sex. The repression of polite society buckles under our animal urges. It is not just that men’s arousal is seen as uncivilized, and therefore dangerous, but that female sexuality is seen as even more potent. It is even more emotional, torrid, and unquenchable. A woman will not settle for a casual quickie before bedtime, she wants real emotional intimacy and passion. These are the true enemy of society. It is her insistence on the genuine that challenges the mollifying pall we are meant to accept as The American Dream.\n\nIn [**David Lynch’s**](https://filmofileshideout.com/archives/favorite-scenes-%E2%84%9617-mulholland-drive/) *Blue Velvet,* Isabella Rossellini’s character stands naked in a suburban living room, like a surreal visage of sex and trauma burning a hole in the fabric of the American Dream. She is the undeniable heat seething beneath the placid surface of bourgeois propriety. She is the linchpin that threatens to bring the whole edifice down. She provokes a hungry and ultimately destructive desire in men, but her desire is even more acute. She cannot contain herself and has been driven mad by the contradictions around her.\n\nIn her autobiography, Rossellini wrote about Lynch, “Once when he was a kid, (Lynch) told me, coming home from school with his older brother, they had seen a naked woman walking down the street. The sight had not excited them, it had frightened them, and David had started to cry.\"\n\n**The Next Three Paragraphs Contain Spoilers**\n\nIn *Private Property,* Ann is not ultimately undone by her passion. It is Duke who falls victim to his depraved desire. So inflamed by Ann’s sexuality, Duke loses all sense of reason and degenerates into his most base form. Typical of the 1960s, the film scrambles to right itself in the end in an effort to satisfy the censors. The bad guy is murdered by Ann’s husband, and Ann is once again placed back in her box where, having learned her lesson, she will be a good girl for the rest of her life. In Hollywood, it is necessary to always put women back in their place so that society’s mores, capitalism, and the American Dream can win out in the end.\n\nAnn Darrow, the lithe femme fatale in *King Kong*, is positioned in the same way. Her sexual potency is so intense, she brings the powerful and immense Kong to his knees, and is ultimately his undoing. Then, once Kong is destroyed, she can go back to her rightful place as submissive ingenue in the arms of our civilized, white male hero.\n\n *Private Property*’s director, Leslie Stevens, worked mostly as a writer for television and was best known for his work on *The Outer Limits*. It looks as though *Private Property* was his only feature film venture. He went into production with high hopes. Even with a meager budget of $59,000, Stevens managed to get A-list cinematographer Ted McCord, and it shows. There are some surprising angles and compositions that help sharpen the tension and conflict. One shot, in particular, stands out. It feels like a shot out of a Sam Fuller film, sort of arty, but gritty. While Duke tries to seduce Ann, the camera sinks low to the ground and shoots the couple dancing through a foregrounded glass of liquor. They seem to be spinning in the booze as Ann slowly loses her inhibitions. \n\nStevens once referred to himself as “America's only authentic New Wave filmmaker.” A stupid thing to say, for sure, but it helps to further illuminate his approach and intentions. I would place *Private Property* more in the noir genre, but noir and New Wave are related, as seen in films like *Breathless* (which also premiered in 1960). Part of the overlap is simply that *Private Property* was a cheap independent film, and so enjoyed a kind of freedom mainstream films did not. It was Stevens’ baby and he was able to try out creative ideas without having to worry about Paramount looking over his shoulder. Hitchcock had a terrible time getting *Psycho* past all the corporate hurdles and moral guard dogs.\n\nCountless films work in this arena. I was going to mention Sam Peckinpah’s *Straw Dogs* (1971), Larry Cohen’s *Bone* (1972), Jerzy Skolimowski’s *The Shout* (1978), or Andrzej Zulawski’s *Possession* (1981), but I decided to take a quick look on *Google* to see what else I might find. I typed in a clumsy approximation of what I was looking for, “movies about women getting seduced”, but the top two hits were “Seductive woman movies” and “Top 10 Seductresses in Film.” *Google* also suggested the following films:\n\n*Weird Science*\n\n*Dracula*\n\n*Carrie*\n\n*Betty Blue*\n\n*Under the Skin*\n\n*The Immaculate Room*\n\n*Palm Springs*\n\n*Death Becomes Her*\n\n*Ghost Ship*\n\n*Species*\n\n*The Return of the Living Dead*\n\n*Dirty Grandpa*\n\nI’m not sure what to make of the strange reversal of seduced to seducer. It would seem that women are more often positioned as seducer rather than seduced. That may not be the case at all, but something made the algorithm switch it.\n\n*Carrie* is an interesting addition. She is seduced and betrayed by several of her peers. The magical powers that enable her revenge stem from her sexuality. Her powers are activated by her getting her first period, and in the end, she is triggered by a shower of blood. Once the cruelty of her middle American high school is revealed, she burns everything and everyone to the ground with the primal power of her female body.\n\n *Private Property* is one among many films that grapple with the evolution and maintenance of bourgeois values. The ideology is intersectional, where all of society’s subtle and not-so-subtle forces are brought to bear. In the end, the title is a pun that enfolds sex, money, power, nature, and transcendence into an ever-changing conflict. We, the audience, watch as these forces are set against each other, and then must decide who to root for. Do we hope for the peaceful order of the American way, or do we give in to the depravity boiling underneath?",

Suddenly the protagonist came to his senses and realized he was too cynical, working life isn't all that bad, and it's just a matter of finding what you can tolerate.\n\n While that may be an uplifting and classically American resolution that probably made audiences feel good, it seems to be in direct opposition with the tone and attitude of the film leading up to that point. The film did such a fantastic job satirizing the workplace environment and really effectively communicated how demoralizing it is to work your life away for other people's profits. Then suddenly the film flips and it's not about that, his job just wasn't the right fit? \n\nIt just felt like they needed to wrap things up nicely and could only do so by abandoning the films point of view. I also just found the setup and world building so much more kinetic and interesting than the actual execution of the story. I feel like this happens a lot and am curious of other examples like this.",

Basically, I had watched everything on my 24-inch monitor, and of course, I've been in love with cinema. A few years ago the debate about cinema vs streaming started but I couldn't weigh in on it, my initial reaction was...who cares? if a film is good, it's good, no matter whether you see it on the big screen or on a laptop. \n\nNow that I'm in UK, I can finally go to cinema and watch films there. So far, I've watched 7, and honestly, my position is challenged. I think it does matter where you see it. The last film I watched was Babylon and I got goosebumps all over me because of the sheer vastness of the screen and music blasting all around you, it was a totally new experience, it was different. The same applied to the new Avatar, it felt like I sensed every bit of the action. \n\nNow, you might say the effect is limited to films that leverage bombastic action scenes, but even in Banshees of Inishirin, where there's no action, I still felt the difference. The faces are more pronounced, the voice and music is much better, and there's no interuption. \n\nOverall, now I see where the likes of Scorcese and Nolan are coming from, we should see films on the big screen to truly appreciate the artistic efforts of hundreds of people behind them. Sure I've loved manty movies watched on my small monitor, but man do I wish I could see them again on the big screen.",

These topics are not something you can have as side plots that neatly resolve at the climax. Imo, either you dedicate your film to these topics, or don't mention them at all.

With a very complicated &amp; sensitive matter at hand, Spielberg show's masterful direction in walking a tight rope and not falling into the politics of it all. Spielberg is here instead to cut to the core human behavior which is in play in such situations. The cost of bloodshed, the indifference of those who call the shots, the feeling of revenge imposed through propaganda &amp; how violence begets violence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe movie starts with a thrilling angle as the team of spies led by Eric Bana's Avner sets off to terminate 11 targets. One would think this would be somewhat of a grounded, realistic Mission Impossible film where the mission is the focus. But post-2000 Spielberg is a different kind who is more interested in characters than spectacle &amp; concepts. And as the movie progresses you realize that the mission is not really the focus of it all. It's the toll it takes on the characters, specifically on Avner the protagonist. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAvner is surrounded by 4 distinct personalities who each bring their own unique takes on the whole thing. Daniel Craig's character is a young man with a hot temper who you expect to follow orders no matter what the cost. Whereas, Ciaran Hinds' character is a more introspective one who sees the bigger picture and plays the Devil's advocate. It is a testament to the dialogue writing and acting that the characters all feel very real. The French informant duo of father &amp; son add an interesting dimension to the plot. There are people who profit out of war and these two serve as an example.\n\nYou initially start thinking that this is going to be a film from the side of one perspective only. But there is enough content sprinkled in to give you a taste of the other perspective too and in the end you realize that Spielberg doesn't really care about either side. The movie wants you to know that in the end, no one wins in this pursuit. There are only losers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAesthetically, Munich is very pleasant. The use of locations to sell period Europe was excellent. The cinematography is equally good and the use of mirrors, reflections and lighting in the movie deserves praise. Some examples of the creative cinematography:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://old.reddit.com/r/CineShots/comments/zcfqll/munich\\_2005/](https://old.reddit.com/r/CineShots/comments/zcfqll/munich_2005/)\n\n[https://old.reddit.com/r/CineShots/comments/zb9k97/munich\\_2005/](https://old.reddit.com/r/CineShots/comments/zb9k97/munich_2005/)\n\n[https://old.reddit.com/r/CineShots/comments/hfy7pq/munich\\_2005/](https://old.reddit.com/r/CineShots/comments/hfy7pq/munich_2005/)\n\n[https://old.reddit.com/r/CineShots/comments/gj9k1z/munich\\_2005/](https://old.reddit.com/r/CineShots/comments/gj9k1z/munich_2005/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJohn Williams is in charge of music and he decides to keep it low key here. Music is used sparingly in this film and it is completely in service to the scenes, never attracting attention with only 2-3 exceptions. There is a thrilling piece that plays occassionally whenever something dramatic is happening on screen which is my favorite piece of music from the film:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L40-thxp6Lg&amp;list=PL2-gnI3llywAfiLZ8seNYZeNiJny60MLZ&amp;index=13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L40-thxp6Lg&amp;list=PL2-gnI3llywAfiLZ8seNYZeNiJny60MLZ&amp;index=13)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMunich is perhaps my favorite film of Steven Spielberg post-2000s. It is very smart and greatly directed. It's surely one of his least-known movies which is understandable given the filmography he has. Two things I would change from the film are Eric Bana as lead &amp; the strange sex scene that plays at the end. Bana was fine, if a bit bland, but a more well-known actor would have brought the film more attention. And that sex scene didn't feel like it belonged to the same movie. Plus it being intercut with the events at the airport was a perplexing choice from Spielberg. Otherwise, I find it really hard to fault the film. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRating: \\*\\*9/10\\*\\*",

        "text": "This is going to sound like it's unrelated to the title, but I promise it connects.\n\nAbout a decade ago, I got really into older films. Like from silent films all the way to 1960's Psycho. For whatever reason, I drifted away from it. But recently I randomly watched Casablanca for the first time in years and now I want to watch nothing but old movies again.\n\nThe main one I'm wanting to watch is The Wind starring Lilian Gish from 1928. I watched it about a decade ago on YouTube, but now obviously it's not on there anymore. I just checked JustWatch and it's not available to stream anywhere. Checked Amazon and it's on DVD but it's a Spanish import and not the right region. Not sure if that matters for PS5, pretty sure it's region free like the Switch, but I never checked. But it's still in Spanish, which I don't speak. Is it available anywhere? Even on a collection of other silent films. I'm considering getting a Charlie Chaplin blu-ray boxset. But I'm seeing two, one from Europe that specifically says it won't work in North America and one from Japan that doesn't say it won't work here, but all the titles and descriptions are in Japanese, so... Yeah.\n\nI wish it was easier to get access to silent films. TCM should have a streaming service that wasn't tied to a cable subscription. They have an app, but you have to login with your cable provider. As I don't have one, I can't use it.\n\nAnother thing I wish was available on blu-ray or even DVD is Hollywood: A Celebration of the American Silent Film. It's a 13 part documentary series from 1980 that is truly incredible! It's on YouTube, but every few years it gets removed and I have to look for the re-upload again. Having it on DVD would make it easier to watch without having to worry about that.\n\nOkay, I started this looking for one movie and I digresssd into a wider range of topics.",

        "text": "I am talking about films that are not necessarily horror films but are recognized for content that nearly anyone would consider horrific like Irreversible and Martyrs.\n\nPersonally for me, it has to be the movie, Mysterious Skin by Gregg Araki, which is a 2004 adaptation from a novel from a 1995 novel of the same name by Scott Heim.\n\nWhile not necessarily as brutal or as gory in its content as films like Cannibal Holocaust or the other films I mentioned, it is probably the most emotionally brutal film I've ever seen. Everything about the film just makes me deeply uncomfortable and makes me think about how seriously severe abuse and trauma can be on a person. \n\nSomething that I quite appreciate about the film is the depiction of the main character, Neil McCormick, who is a gay male prostitute and a young man with a traumatic childhood experience of sexual abuse in the hands of his baseball coach. The way he reacts and copes to his abuse and abandonment by his coach later is by finding some kind of value by having sex with men who are much older than him in his young adulthood. I think he depicts very well this idea about just how children are pretty easily influenced by their relationship with adults and take their actions around them as something they must either strive for or value later in their lives. I think another interesting about his character is that his character as a child does already seem to have a crush on the coach and at the process of discovering his homosexuality. Usually when child sexual abuse is presented in fiction, the child is pretty unambiguously not okay with it and are pretty unaware of what is it they are getting involved in. Neil seems to want to be with the coach and takes it as a meaningful connection that he gets sexually abused. And with this aspect, I think it further reinforces how a child cannot ever consent even if they want to \"discover themselves\" but I also think it might also express how sometimes groomers can take advantage of LGBTQ minors/children who feel they need to someone to validate that aspect of themselves and makes them grow up to know about this sexual experience. The coach is also not presented as a typical ugly monster but the kind of guy you would wanna be with and that seems to care  for you. They understand how they don't need force in order to be at the tip of their fingers. They just need to make you feel like you need them. I do think there is also a lot of value in the depiction of Brian's coping mechanism to his trauma but I do think Neil's portrayal is the more interesting and relatable one for me.\n\nThe reason the film is so incredibly disturbing is because it just feels deeply familiar. It doesn't need all this blood and all of this exploitative misery in order to make you empathize with the victims. It just shows you what we need to understand. That abuse can be as mundane and as common as a coming-of-age story. \n\nSome people say that the ending is rather hopeful but in my personal opinion, I don't think it is. Like yes, they do come to realize together the abuse they've suffered and Neil is there to keep Brian company and relieve him from his scars but they never find their abuser who very likely gotten away with it and also has probably gone off to groom more kids. And the show ends with them in a distant shot of them in a black void that dissipates into nothingness, which implies that they are alone and lost in this world to suffer their traumas for their whole lives. And not own interpretation but I read this cool comment on YouTube that the ending symbolizes that there is no such thing as a afterlife or meaning to this whole journey. No justice or retribution. And instead of flying like angels in the night, like the final monologue says, they fade in the darkness while still in the real world. It's a very sad but effective ending.",

The first shot in the clip has her framed by the silhouette of the door for a few seconds before the German official called \"The Jew-Hunter\" (played by Christoph Waltz) enters the frame and becomes the new figure framed by the door.\n\nWhat purpose does this technique serve in getting meaning across in this particular scene? When it was just the fleeing girl framed by the door, it reminded me of a gunsight, and that was meaningful to me because she is, after all, a target. But Christoph Waltz essentially taking her place kind of muddied the waters for me.\n\nI've noticed this frame-within-a-frame technique a lot in the films I've seen in the last few months, and I always wonder what it's supposed to do as an artistic device other than look interesting, add depth etc. Any insight would be much appreciated! :)",

        "text": "A fair warning that this is spoilerish. But if you wouldn't watch it if you didn't get an incentive, this won't hurt you.\n\nYet again I have to ponder why it is that I seem incapable of disliking a film. Is it low standards, a higher passion or lack in film sophistication? This is a rhetorical question. It's just a way of life, I guess. I appreciate what is to be appreciated, and I don't hang myself up on a film's shortcomings, nor do I necessarily seem them as such. More often than not, they seem more akin to unique personality rather than an inherent problem - be it Christopher Nolan's cold characters, Quentin Tarantino's never-ending use of references or D. W. Griffith's love for massive pathos - the latter might be bad example though given how many of his films feel almost condescending, and, in its older meaning, certainly apologetic. But what is to dislike of a film that doesn't downright claim that the KKK is good (as in, a morally inherently shitty film), but merely depicts the racial tensions, as in, a film that I can't hate because of something it wants to sell me?\n\nThis film is by no means perfect, personality or not. This film is, also, not just your average low effort oh-lock-at-this-star-and-these-funny-jokes film that has no merit of watching unless you like that specific actor, editor, or set designer. It is, in nearly all ways, noticeably done by people who know what they do, and who have a very specific vision that they want to show you. This had been true for every Ben Affleck film and Live by Night is not a sudden exception.\n\nThe problem that after my viewing has been on my mind even ignoring the bad reviews is, well, hard to pinpoint. The set design is formidable, the direction is just fine, the actors don't get all that much to do (Chris Cooper is great though), in that scenario it's mostly a star film rather than an actors film, if you catch my drift, even though it's filled to the brim with actors - great presence, great chemistry between everyone, which really helps the immersion and to stay interested, but you won't get an Marlon Brando performance. The music... was good. I don't quite remember it that well but it did its job well in a very classical way. The films breaks gangster conventions and clearly tries to keep that train going right up to the end, which is fine too, at times pretty cool. But then! Yes, not much in this film is, you know, \"outstanding\", apart from some really awesome fight scenes (which aren't to be neglected just because they're not constant, they're really cool), a great dialogue between Elle Fanning and Ben Affleck which resonated a lot with me, a repeat offender when it comes to doubting faith without being quite able to let go of it.\n\nThe set design is accurate, sure, but it doesn't feel... passionate. Sorry, designers, maybe you had passion, some of y'all probably did, but it's just, the whole thing, like, literally, the whole thing, just looks a tad bit too smooth, and that to part might also be thanks to the gray filter that seemed to chase Ben Affleck during those years with Zack Snyder and, as far as previews make it seem, The Accountant. It's there, yes. It's a creative decision. (You can quote me on that.) Ben Affleck isn't known for over-acting but he's also not known for being over-shadowed - he is a star, a lowkey one, which in of itself seems to be an already surprisingly contradictory thing that I really appreciate. The cinematography is cool, at times pretty awesome, and some compositions were fucking cool (burning car in water comes to mind! nice!!). All of this is fine, really, all of it, and, to stop being so neutral, definitely enjoyable. The voice-over is certainly excessive and I know that people deem it the laziest shit fathomable if it's not Charlie Kaufman using it in order to fuck with it, but with classically seeming productions like these I kind of think of them as soothing and reminsicing of a novel - which I like, but is, well, why people have a problem with it. Could the film have done without them? ... no. Too many time skips. Not a bad thing to me personally, but ey.\n\nThis pattern stretches over to plot and themes as well. Doubt, racism, gangster idealization - so many things that Affleck clearly wants to give some insights to that just don't... that just don't feel all that deeply explored. Not enough to give you really memorable perspectives - apart from maybe Elle Fanning's café scene. I did appreciate how Figgis and Joe were cool with each other without the kinda expected \"uuuh gangster yes yes money and don't you touch my daughter\". A noteworthy moment was certainly when you feel ambivalent about the death of a KKK member - because on the one hand, you don't want Joe to become a bad gangster, to cross too many lines, but on the other, it's the fucking KKK. Well done. Well done scene too, by the way. Hell, all the KKK scenes were intense, even though I think his black colleagues never even really mentioned them. No time, plot needed to go further (lol?).\n\nWhat stands out a lot too is the editing though, which has been a bit staggering at times. The beginning's chase scene had so much editing going on that I couldn't stop noticing it, which is not really a good thing, but also, you know, not necessarily bad - it did emphasize on the chaotic nature of the moment. And I do not believe, contrary to popular opinion, that shaky cams, quick editing or whatever in action scenes are an inherent sign of bad quality and that John Wick or Mad Max: Fury Road are the epitome of everything good in action films. Well, they are kinda... whatever, point being, it's a reoccurring theme because it's easy, as it is already nauseating on its own. It entirely depends on what you wanna achieve with your film.\n\nBut it's not (I assume) the editing's fault that the film is so short. There is no director's cut, no The Town 30 minutes adding situation. This is a rare occasion of a film that definitely needs another 30 minutes, or another hour. This doesn't necessarily have to be due to the fact, but probably also owes to it, that Affleck chose to adapt the second novel of a trilogy by Dennis Lehane, author of Shutter Island, Mystiv River and Gone Baby Gone. I have not much doubt that this would have been a fucking cool trilogy. I want to see and hear more of weary Brendan Gleeson and his soothing voice. :(\n\nUltimately, the themes in this film are shown in *this* film, regardless of how much better and more meaningful the fate of the protagonist feels with knowing the story of the first novel (I don't). The  KKK is in this film, the South, the Prohibition and faith. This film. Give these arcs more time to unfold, not even necessarily more high notes / melodrama, just more depth, and this could have gone into an interesting True Detective direction. Instead, the topics exist just to go away. When years flying by within seconds of editing isn't what feels like an interesting fast-\"paced\" choice but the fucking topics, what the fuck. Come on, one hour more and assuming it isn't just filled with more \"uh yeh\", this film could have been right up there with Affleck's other greats. The novel  has 400 pages. Gone Baby Gone has 250 and the films differ in 15 minutes of runtime. &gt;:( Was it the studio, funding? Was it Affleck? No clue, but this is what puts this film down. Everything else is fine, this is just a missed opportunity. The film isn't inherently fast paced, it goes slow and introspective, but that is just incongruent with it just, not glossing over, not always going past, but still going rather quickly through themes that it wants to explore.\n\nALL THAT BEING SAID, I enjoyed the film. I will not rewatch it anytime soon (I might after \\[if ever\\] reading the undoubtedly formidable novels), but whenever shit got real, it got real, and the climax kicks ass no matter how questionable you find certain decisions and how much you're annoyed by some characters (I wasn't though). I also gotta say that the romance plot even if a bit weirdly glossed over for a while (again understandably but with not enough patience to at least make clear that that is intentional character development) feels very fitting given the tone and whole nature of the film, flaws and all. It has that going for itself. Chris Cooper fans will get their fair share, struggling with faith on a daily basis will not harm the experience, and if there are any fedora fetishists out there, you will fucking love this film. I'm glad that Affleck does films again and I hope this won't discourage him from another go at crime dramas. I still don't really regret having skipped watching it in cinema but I also believe that it loses a fair bit if watched on, say, a laptop screen. Take that as you will. Peace. :)",

Despite their differences, Tom and Summer begin a whirlwind romance that quickly becomes the defining relationship of Tom's life.\n\nHowever, as the relationship progresses, Tom realizes that Summer is not the woman he thought she was and their relationship becomes complicated. The film uses a non-linear narrative structure to jump between different moments in their relationship, starting with day 1 of their 500-day relationship and moving forward and backward in time to explore the ups and downs of their love story.\n\nThroughout the film, Tom is faced with difficult realizations about love and relationships, including the idea that love isn't always enough and that sometimes, no matter how hard you try, you can't make someone love you back. He also learns that the expectations and beliefs we have about love can often be unrealistic, and that sometimes, even the best relationships can end in heartbreak.\n\nDespite its often heartbreaking subject matter, \"500 Days of Summer\" is a film that's full of humor, heart, and hope. With its clever writing, charming performances, and beautiful visuals, this film is a must-see for anyone who loves a good love story.",

        "text": "Sorry for the awkward title to this post but I can't think of a better what of putting in succinctly. What I'm talking about it is movies that have a great build up and payoff. Movies in which the ending fits perfectly to everything that came before it. It could be a satisfying resolution to a mystery, a release of building tension, etc. Here are some movies which give me this feeling. \n\nMulholland Drive- To me this is the perfect mystery because the ending repurposes pretty much every scene in the movie in a different viewpoint. All along we were watching clues and didn't even realize it. It is one of the only \"twist\" movies that feels 100% justified and makes the entire movie better as a result.\n\nTaxi Driver- This is the perfect example of building tension throughout the while movie. The film is a brilliant character study but also builds up to an inevitable explosion of violence. When it does happen it works perfectly with the themes of the film and is so well made that is doesn't disappoint in the slightest way.\n\nThe Good, The Bad, and the Ugly- What is always amazing about this movie to me is that it starts out almost like an average almost trashy spaghetti western, similarly to Leone's first western, the very low budget Fistful of Dollars. However, TGTBATU becomes more and more epic and operatic as it goes along revealing surprisingly deep themes about the relativity of \"goodness\". The climax is perhaps the most epic thing I've seen in a film even if it's just 3 guys staring at each other. A perfect payoff. \n\nNashville- Altman created a fascinating tableaux of many characters striving to make it big, keep their status or use others for their advantage in the city of Nashville. At the same time the film is a complex statement about America and the ending brings all the characters together and resolves everything in an emotional and powerful way, revealing even more of it's theme of the American dream and nightmare.",

I saw it in a 40-50 person theater at my nearest AMC, but it would have been better to watch on a bigger screen.\n\nI walked out the first time and thought that it was beautifully filmed. Great cinematography, soundtrack was the best I have heard in a while. The trumpets are a bit excessive at times, but it hits at the right time during the scenes. I didn't really understand why critics hated on the movie and the why it bombed, but that became more clear the second time.\n\nThere's definitely parts that could be cut out. I think the movie could have ended after Nellie fades away into the dark. We know Jack's fate by then, and Manny's fate could be left to interpretation. There wasn't any need to time jump to 1950s and show his kid, but I appreciated that part.\n\nDefinitely a jumbled mess of scenes at times, but beautifully put together imo. Pacing fell off in the third act, but fuck it. I don't think we'll see a movie like for a long time, and I hope it becomes a candidate for critical reevaluation in about 5 years time. \n\nThe scene where Jack talks to Lady Fay the last time put tears in my eyes the second time around. One of Pitt's finest acting pieces combined with the beautiful piano tune in the background did it for me. To all those who didn't enjoy the movie -- I hope you give it a second chance later on, and I hope that your perception changes.\n\nEasily top 3 of the last year for me, no questions asked. Just wanted to share my thoughts with the community. They had some posters at my nearby theater too, grabbed a couple of those (It's a still from the scene when Nellie gets the acting gig and steps out of the castle after the party into the sunlight).",

I've just been watching a lot of Wong Kar Wai's films, and it's hard to put into words exactly why the combination of cinematography, editing, use of music and acting is as impactful as it is.

        "text": "I was too young to see Richard Linklater's classic 1990s romance *Before Sunrise* when it came out in 1995. I probably saw it for the first time a few years later, before knowing what it meant to fall in love and before seeing Vienna, the film's setting, for myself. It was, at the time, a more-or-less contemporary film about relationships and emotions I looked forward to experiencing. It was about my future.\n\nI saw *Before Sunrise* again a few days ago, almost thirty years after it was made, having known love, experienced romance and having visited the city of Vienna. This time it was a film about what was (or what could have been), a film about the past: my own and the world's. Although I had liked it in the 1990s, I liked it more in the 2020s. Watching the two main characters, Jesse and Céline, fall in love in a world so unlike our own, I realized *Before Sunrise* was always about memory, and therefore nostalgia, a personal recollection of a romance that happened rather than a straight telling of the romance itself; the further we get from 1995, the more nostalgic it becomes.\n\n*Before Sunrise* could not happen today.\n\nJesse and Céline, who meet on a train after Céline switches seats, annoyed by the bickering of a nearby couple, converge because of a shared observation of this event. They're both reading books without being absorbed by them, and put down their books to talk. If Jesse and Céline were on a train today, they both would be using their phones. Céline would not have been annoyed by the bickering older couple because there would not have been one; the man and woman would have escaped into their phones instead of bickering. If that didn't happen, Céline would have been on her phone so would not have been sufficiently annoyed (bickering being less annoying when you're on your phone than when reading Bataille) to move, or would have drowned them out using earphones. If, for some reason, the couple did bicker and Céline did change spots, Jesse, on his own phone, would probably not notice Céline; if he did, he would not have noticed the couple bickering, which would have denied him and Céline their conversation starter.\n\nIt strikes me that if *Before Sunrise* happened today, Jesse and Céline would have had a greater chance of meeting other people while on the train, online and perhaps half a world away, than each other. Whether that's good or bad is up for debate, but it illustrates how much technology, and therefore society, has changed between 1995 and 2023. We currently live in a connected world. *Before Sunrise*, in its glow of remembered naturalism, is about a past world: one absorbed by the art of making connections. In less than thirty years, activity has become passivity, even as the number of connections we effortlessly have would have been unimaginable to young people on a European train a mere three decades ago. And when they get off the train—they can't get lost together if they both have Google Maps. They don't need to ask the locals what to see. What a different encounter. What a different love. What a different film.",

I love everything about it; the unbelievable imagery, the surreal (heh) feel, the emotive elements, and the rich amounts of symbolism. \n\nSurrealism has diversity, too; it can be erotic, subtly surreal, or scary. The genre can have moments that make you say, “what the HELL is that”, and color schemes can be extremely prominent! Buñuel’s take on surrealism could be rebellious, satirical and vulgar, whereas Lynch fell into that “unexplainable nightmare” mode. Raul Ruiz felt like an even more bizarre take on Buñuel, and Tarkovsky was beautiful, graceful &amp; philosophical/meditative. \n\nThe cinematography can be stunning, too. Films such as Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors, The Three Crowns of the Sailor, City of Pirates, Daisies, 8 1/2, Juliet of the Spirits, Carnival of Souls, Morgiana, Szindbád and more can have disorienting visuals, spinning, seemingly impossible angles, etc. that really accentuated the dream-like/abstract feel. \n\nI’m a huuuge fan of that dream-like/abstract feel, too!! Surrealist films did so well with recreating what it’s like to have a dream; bizarre situations, seemingly illogical events, teleportations, distortions, extremely strong memories, contradictory dialogue, etc. \n\nFilms like Grass Labyrinth, Farewell to the Ark, The Colour of Pomegranates, The Eve of Ivan Kupalo, Fruit of Paradise &amp; Pastoral: To Die in the Country could be confusing initially, but there’s so much symbolism that you can find. Those films are full of allusions/double meanings (potentially), and there’s a LOT to unpack with future viewings. \n\nWatching a surrealist film (depending on the movie/director) could be like listening to Captain Beefheart; specifically, you’re in for an experience that says “F*** that” to boundaries &amp; conventions.

        "text": " Lately I have been dealing with what I believe is film burnout. It just hit me randomly about five to six days ago. This has never happened before, as I have always been an avid film watcher (Probably four to five films per week), and lover of all things cinema.\n\nAbout two weeks ago I started to go down the classic film rabbit hole much more extensively than I ever have before (Pre-Hollywood Era -Silent Films-, Golden Age era), and I was absolutely enjoying myself. I went through my Letterboxd, and saved around 100 films pre-1960 onto my Watchlist and challenged myself to watch all of them in 2023.\n\nThis wasn't an issue at first, but after about a week or so, I started to become somewhat apprehensive about starting a film. Not just a classic film, but anything modern as well. Once I start the film, I can enjoy myself like usual but it takes quite a bit of time for me to work up the mental strength to start it in the first place. Even when I do start it, although I can enjoy it, its like my brain is constantly reminding me that I am watching a movie, and it pulls me out of the experience... Sometimes it almost feels like a chore, and I hate that because movies have always been probably one of the biggest sources of joy through my entire life.\n\nThis has essentially caused me to play mental gymnastics with myself and question if I actually like movies as much as I thought I did. I know logically I do, but for some reason I can't shake this thought pattern and I wish it would go away so I can get back to enjoying what I love most.\n\nI have also been dealing with other stressful things in my life, so I am not sure if it is the film itself that I am apprehensive about, or if my brain is just dealing with other things.\n\nHas anyone ever experienced this? There is so much more to it but I am at work right now so I am a bit distracted, but I would love to hear what you all have to say.",

The Lighthouse is Incredible, delivered by Masterful performance by Willem Dafoe and an Underrated performance by Robert Pattinson. Willem Dafoe especially steals the show, and should of been nominated for a Academy Award.  The visuals and atmosphere at work are incredible, being dirty, grand, and enclosed all at once.  \n\nThe Northman, Robert Eggers is proving himself to be a great auteur and probably in very important Film Director in the future.  The set design, costumes and period detail were all outstanding. The Performances are also great (Alexander Skarsgard, Ana Taylor Joy, Nicole Kidman, Claes Bang) and great cameos (Bjork and Willem Dafoe). my main complaint for this movie is that it needed more Willem Dafoe, and maybe 10-20 minutes that needed to be added to The Northman. \n\nI can't wait for Robert Eggers's upcoming Nosferatu remake (with Bill Skarsgard, Lily Rose Depp, Nicolas Hoult) and maybe Willem Dafoe as he is in talks with Eggers and I am confident that he will appear.",

It is heavily insinuated that DiCaprio’s character is truly the father of the baby.\n\nThere are several other examples, such as Damon calling the firefighters “faggots” and “homos” to an excessive degree. \n\nI know I saw a video detailing this subplot, but I was curious if any viewers noticed this thread and has an idea of what it means on a larger scale in relation to the film, it’s characters, and it’s themes.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/10m71xe/interesting_use_of_diegetic_sound_in_the_opening/",
        "text": "Noticed an interesting use of disguised diegetic sound in the opening scene of Eyes Wide Shut that I think effectively communicates a key trait of the main character. \n\n\nEyes Wide Shut opens as follows: four opening credit cards, a shot of Alice undressing, the title card, a shot of the New York streets, and finally a shot of Bill and Alice Hartford getting ready for an evening out. All throughout this sequence, from the very first credit, music plays. In particular, it is classical music - Dmitri Shostakovich's Waltz No. 2 from Suite for Variety Stage Orchestra. \n\n\nAs the music plays through these title cards, the Alice intercut shot, and an exterior shot, I think it is easy to read the music as non-diegetic music, or music that is coming from outside the world of the film. \n\n\nHowever, this is shattered when Bill turns off the stereo on their way out of their bedroom, cutting the music and revealing it to have been playing in their bedroom the entire time. While this type of shift might not be exactly ground-breaking in itself, it works perfectly for Bill’s story and character. \n\n\nI believe it is so effective because that reveal completely shifts the deliverer of this piece of information. In the first read of the music, the deliverer is the director or the “author” of this story. They are telling you that this film is about the types of people who listen to lofty, sophisticated classical music. However, when the shift is made to diegetic music, it is now the *characters themselves* that are telling you that they listen to classical music. \n\n\nThis is perfectly in line with all of Bill’s actions throughout the film, who desperately wants to be accepted by the class of people above him (and of course will take more extreme actions later on to portray himself as someone who belongs to that class). \n\n\nNot a full-blown Kubrick/EWS theory here - just thought it was a pretty simple yet elegant filmmaking choice. Though in doing some searches to see if anyone else had talked about this I found this interesting Reddit post from a couple years back by u/33DOEyesWideShut that has some interesting takes on diegetic sounds throughout the rest of the film: https://www.reddit.com/r/StanleyKubrick/comments/psvkx3/the_metafictional_genius_of_eyes_wide_shut/",

        "text": "This film told somewhat in real-time doesn't only star the exceedingly hot Hiroyuki Sanada, it also stars the exceedingly beautiful Michelle Reis and an exceedingly awesome trumpet. When you expect a merely somewhat okayish nice film that somehow stars Jun Kunimura, Hiroyuki Sanada, Michelle Reis and a trumpet you should already realize what a fucking oxymoron that must be. And if you don't, you'll realize at the latest when the title hits you with Miles Davis, when the jazz hits you, or the cinematography of a camera that is like a floating saxophone all on its own already.\n\nMy first association is of course(?) with that one big Japanese nightly chaotic good gangster chase scenes jazz thing with the hot protagonist who kinda gets dragged into shit - Cowboy Bebop. One part of me likes to imagine Koji as grand-grand-grandfather of Spike Spiegel, but something in me says that that isn't right, that this film stands very much on its own feet. I just can't help but perceive all those jazzy adventures as brothers and sisters from another mother, or the same mother, where language means love and language barriers nothing at all, where loving chaos and acceptance rule, experimentation and openness. (What fits better than a Michelle Reis with an odd Japanese accent - well, shit, to my ears, and I don't speak Japanese.) It's jazz, \"so what\"!\n\nWhat arises is a chaotic chasing scene that somehow takes one and a half hour without raising the stakes too high or too low. You sit back, head bouncing, or fingers, and can't help but be staggered by the sheer volume of Koji's fucking clumsiness. What a sight. That sheer concept. A badass (exceedingly attractive) protagonist that has to sneak along a perfectly straight corridor and manages to (in an exceedingly attractive way) stumble, crash into a whole-ass pile of whatevers, make the loudest ruckus, fall back, tear down the whole stage that he stood beside, crash into the performer and just jump back up without ever referencing what a fucking dumbass he just was. It just doesn't stop being funny. In fact, I want a whole movie where nothing happens, no conflict, just Michelle Reis walking along Hiroyuki Sanada buying (in an exeedingly attractive way) some new mouthpiece and on the way tearing down the whole damn town. This is what happened to Atlantis: jazz. Well, now we know why New Orleans is at the ocean. Okay, there wasn't SO much clumsiness going on. Where am I even going with this review?\n\nThis film slaps. It's fun, it's musical, it's passionate, and it's fucking overlooked. Jazz, Cowboy Bebop, Michelle Reis, exceedingly hot Hiroyku Sanada (I KNOW THAT HE'S MORE THAN HIS LOOKS I KNOW). There might be a person, or so I've been told, that hasn't seen this film even though said person likes some of these things. My advise: don't be that person. Just stumble your way into this show for one nice evening. Ah, whatever, a fucking great evening.",

        "text": "*Taming the Garden* (2021) directed by Salomé Jashi, is one of the most upsetting films I have watched. I viewed it a few days ago for the first time, and each time I think of it, I find myself growing angrier and angrier. What originally baffled me has now filled me with righteous fury. This film is deeply strange and deeply moving.\n\nThis documentary follows a crew of tree movers, who work for the former Prime Minister of Georgia, Bidzina Ivanishvili. Ivanishvili has an arboretum on one of his estates, which was opened to the public in 2020. It includes massive collection of century-old trees, which the tree movers of the documentary are tasked with transplanting.\n\nThe film can roughly be divided into two parts. The first half of the film is focused on the how of moving multi-ton old growth trees from various areas in rural Georgia to the coast, to be transported over the Black Sea to Ivanishvili's arboretum on the coast. We see candid discussions amongst the tree moving crew, the families that own the trees, and the local townsfolk. Logistical preparations like widening roads and clearing smaller trees in the path of the trucks. Different groups discuss the payment for the tree, how it seems like a good deal, that they themselves don't fault the owners for accepting. Arguments between tree owners and the tree moving crew take the form of a homeowner complaining to a construction contractor whose work isn't up to par. Many people express confusion about Ivanishvili's desire to move these trees. Anecdotes paint him as a strange and eccentric man.\n\nThe second half of the film concerns itself with the outcomes of this process. As the tree removal progresses at two sites, we are made aware of the physical toll this process has had on the landscape, and the emotional toll it has on the people who have known this tree for their whole lives. The end of the film is where reality sets in. \n\nThree sequences close the documentary, and summarize the film. We finally see a tree being transported during the day. A crowd of people follow the slow-moving trucks on foot, with various people in tears, discussing the tree. It is a funeral procession. Then the tree is loaded on a boat, and we watch the journey over the water to the estate. The tree is crossing the river Styx, passing the threshold into the afterlife. We are then treated to footage of the estate. Each massive tree is planted on what may as well be a golf course. The trees require thick black cables that run are attached near the top, and run to the ground apparently about 10-20ft from the base of the tree. They are held up against their will. It is a prison. It is purgatory.\n\nI cannot stop thinking about these cabled trees. Slowly and meticulously ripped from their environment, chained to the ground on some oligarch's estate. Hundreds of century old behemoths, were stacked next to each other like toys on a shelf, their pride and majesty stripped from them. At the top of a hill in their original homes, they towered, a landmark for everything living in their domain. Now they're just a piece of some man's collection. \n\nThe thing that upsets me most is what we don't see at all. We see the tree moving crew, seasoned with years of experience transporting these massive trees. But, this is not a common vocation; their skills had to be developed. How many trees were lost for the trees on the estate to remain?\n\nThis film has completely changed the way I look at the natural landscape. In addition to the moving narrative expressed with sparing dialogue, the lush and surreal images make the film a visual feast. Highly recommend, 10/10, one of the best documentaries I have ever seen.",

        "text": "I saw five films via Sundance online this year. Did you get to go? Or watch anything online? Let’s discuss! Here’s what I saw and my thoughts:\n\nTheater Camp (Molly Gordon and Nick Lieberman) - A comedy about a theater camp and what happens when the director has a massive seizure and is incapacitated, leaving her straight vlogger bro son in charge. As someone whose favorite film is Waiting for Guffman and who has a Stephen Sondheim poster on my bedroom wall, this was made for me, but I was a bit alarmed at how fast it dumps the artifice of a mockumentary. I wish it had utilized talking heads like, at all. Not every documentary or even mockumentary has to have them, but I feel like it would’ve helped play with irony and develop the characters a bit better. Like what would be a bigger opportunity for humor  than seeing these theater kids vamp for the camera head on? That being said, I had a blast. Very, very funny. Can’t wait to watch again. 3.5 ⭐️ \n\nKokomo City (D. Smith) - A documentary following four trans woman sex workers. Weirdly turns out to be, in a big way, about how men oppress women and themselves in turn, and how gender essentialist thought will bankrupt us all. It shows the way black trans women have to be everything to everybody, the way they compress themselves into shapes to fit. Also touches on the inequities capitalism forces us to acquaint ourselves with — you will never question the inherent value of a Benihana dinner the way this film will have you doing — and shows us the face of those most affected by these inequities. Funny and heartbreaking in a million ways. Edgy and dangerous. I hope people see this. 4 ⭐️ \n\nThe Persian Version (Maryam Keshavarz) - An Iranian family gathers around their ailing patriarch post-heart transplant, and slowly implode as secrets come to light and histories are explored. Kind of feels like it loses the plot amidst one character history unspooling into the next. At its best when it’s trying to be My Big Gay Iranian Heart Transplant - i.e. a family dramedy - but I think it swings too big and tries to be too many things. The extended flashback absolutely stymies any forward momentum the film has. Though it is well filmed and touching, I feel like the whole flashback narrative could do with some subtlety. The themes on motherhood are spelled out in big bold letters and spoken to the camera directly. I liked the comedic premise of Leilah having eight brothers and them all fitting a stereotype, but we don’t get to know them at all (although I could’ve definitely done without them during the climax, so weird). The heart of the film lies in the spiky relationship between mother and daughter, of which we needed much more. 2.5 ⭐️ \n\nFancy Dance (Erica Tremblay) - An indigenous woman fights for custody of her niece as she searches for her missing sister. Lily Gladstone knocks it out of the park with this harrowing performance. Subtle and heartbreaking, it highlights the epidemic of missing indigenous women in a very human way. Need to watch again because I fell asleep towards the tail end. 3.5 ⭐️ \n\nJoyland (Saim Sadiq) - A married man joins an erotic dance troupe and falls in love with the trans woman who stars in it. This was slow and beautiful, and the family drama is tense and puts The Persian Version to shame in that regard. One thing I loved about my selections for this year’s Sundance was seeing films with such varied perspectives that are so original and foreign to me, really opens up my understanding of the world. 4 ⭐️",

        "text": "Disney's _DINOSAUR_ is generally deemed as nothing more than either a tech demo or a cash grab to promote Walt Disney World Resort's ride attraction of the same name. But personally, I see it as a good example of filmmakers trying to push the envelope on every level, not just in the technical departments (from visual effects, to cinematography, to score, to sound design), but also in the storytelling department; only for studios to ditch the latter for a more conventional film. And even with all that studio interference, the filmmakers' ambition is still felt through and through. Despite the comedic and lighthearted moments, it's evident that there was an attempt at telling a more serious story that kids and adult could follow.\n\nEven 22 years later, this is one of the most visually stunning films I've ever seen. The insane levels of detail in these animals is mind blowing. The characters feel huge and heavy, and you can see the great care put into the physics of the flesh and muscles shaking and wrinkling whenever they move. The facial animation is also really impressive. Notice how many shots are close ups. There's so much fluidity and character in their expressions. That level of detail in CG facial animation was quite unprecedented back in 2000. So yes, this film is still a technical milestone in my eyes. The cinematography is also spectacular, as it makes the scale feel so much larger than life. There're some great landscapes beautifully shot, with a few of them being combined into one. Not to mention, the camera work is very creative at times. \n\nOne thing I really appreciate about _DINOSAUR_ is that even though the story is very simple and the plot is very straightforward, the message feels sincere. Throughout the film, we see the importance of working together and the way it builds upon that idea flows naturally. We see it exemplified through Aladar, as those are the principles he was raised on by his lemur family. And during the entire section of the herd moving, we see him trying to help others, whether it's to get some water or get everyone safe. This genuine wholesomeness, along with a no nonsese attitude and proactivity, is what makes Aladar a likable character and easy to root for. His altruism and the white savior tropes might be on the nose to some, but I like that he's still humble enough to hear others' points of view.\n\nBaylene and Eema are instantly likable for the simple reason that they're not the usual characters a hero becomes friends with in the middle of his journey. It's really interesting how the two elderly females complement Aladar and the lemurs as a team/family, and you quickly buy their bond with these newcomers. It is specially satisfying to see how Aladar's optimism inspires Baylene and Eema to persevere, to the point that they repay him with that same optimism when he briefly loses all hope. Going back to the theme of working together, the movie does a good job addressing the fact that every living creature, no matter how big or small (and yes, that includes the lemurs), is capable of leaving an impact on others.\n\nOther things that make the story not bland (at least for me) are the stakes being high and the theme of survival, which is tackled in a mature yet easy to follow way. Hence, the \"only the strong survive\" concept that Neera, Bruton and Kron represent being challenged by Aladar's belief that togetherness guarantees the survival and growth of the herd.\n\nBruton is probably the character with the most interesting arc, as he's someone, much like Kron, who has clearly been leading the herd for a while. So based on their long experience doing so, both he and Kron have a hard time getting into Aladar's way of thinking. But the reason why Bruton's redemption works is because early on we see his loyalty towards Kron and their own principles. Neither of them is necessarily evil. They just want the herd to survive and they feel that any distraction might slow them down from getting to the nesting grounds. It is only when he gets to the cave that he contemplates that even all wounded, he can still get there and be helpful to others. But once the carnotaurs start attacking Aladar, Bruton realizes that the misfits will need this newcomer more than him. So he goes back to save Aladar, fights the carnotaurs and sacrifices himself in the process. Another thing I like about his redemption and death is that they take place way before the third act begins.\n\nGoing back to the stakes being high, that's also because the action is quite intense for a family friendly film. So many characters die in it. After Bruton gets brutally (no pun intended) attacked by the carnotaurs, the cinematography doesn't shy away from showing the fresh wounds. Also, notice how towards the end of the movie, Aladar's tail still sports the marks of the carnotaur's bite. The attention to these little details from the filmmakers is very much appreciated, as it shows that every action leaves consequences. All the predators have an imposing presence and are legitimately threatning. And the _\"monster cloud\"_ that emerges after the meteor is one of the most heart-pumping action sequences Disney has ever produced.\n\nI can't talk about _DINOSAUR_ without mentioning the musical score. James Newton Howard's work in this film is still the best he's ever done (in my humble opinion), and that man has composed so many incredible scores. An absolute gem from the Disney Records.\n\nAnd last but not least, there's the pay-off of the characters finally achieving their goal. After the monster cloud destroys the lemurs' island, a lot of the movie takes place in deserts and canyons. And this is one complain I've seen many people make about _DINOSAUR_. After watching those beautiful landscapes in the opening sequence, they don't like that a big chunk of the film has very dry and drab sceneraies. But honestly, that's why it's so rewarding when the characters finally arrive at the nesting grounds.\n\nThere's a few problems I have with the film. Some of the dialogue is too modern and too weird, it just doesn't fit at all because the filmmakers are prioritizing the animalistic nature of these creatures despite the small anthropomorphic licences. I can't stand the fact that Url is literally Eema's pet and acts literally like a dog. It just brings too many questions when compared to the rest of the dinosaurs that don't speak. This character is way more useless than Spike from _The land before time_ (great movie with a couple of annoying characters). But these problems in DINOSAUR could've been easily solved by one simple yet major change:\n\n**_DINOSAUR_ would've greatly benefited itself if there had been no dialogue at all, which is what the crew behind it originally intended.** They wanted it to be a silent film, but Michael Eisner demanded that the characters talked so that the project was more commercially accessible towards children. It definitely would've been an innovative style from a studio notably known for fancy characters and musicals. Heck, maybe it would've had an impact on Disney's way of telling stories. There's a reason the opening 7 minutes are what people remember the most about the film. In fact, the filmmakers made that 5 minute teaser back in 1999, hoping that it would convince the heads at Disney to ditch the talking in the film. But nonetheless, I still think _DINOSAUR_ is one of the most audacious projects the studio has ever made.",

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - What are some of the worst \"takes\" or interpretations of films you've ever seen, whether legit critics, film blogs, or the like? Because some of these Midsommar ones, oh my.... (is there a subreddit for this anywhere?)\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------\n\nI rewatched Midsommar for the umpteenth time, and was just doing some more research on the narrative, subtext, and epic depth of symbolism, symbology.  Couple that to the usage and research of real Celtic, Scandinavian, and Icelandic history (I know Iceland is culturally Scandinavian, while not being considered geographically Scandinavian)... and I had no idea there were so many people that \\[WHOOSH\\] missed the point. \n\nLike, incomprehensibly and almost inexplicably or deliberately lost as to the message of the film. The simplest explanation \\[SPOILERS\\] of this film is that&gt;!Danni traded a vanilla and typical toxic relationship for a mind-breaking coup-de-grace of toxic families and relationships. The smile was her completely broken into the cult. Her sanity is slipping away, and she's lost in the final grips of her mental illness, giving herself over to the Harga.!&lt;\n\nTo put it all out there, I'm a pretty progressive person. I like transgressive takes in art, I am not a huge fan of postmodernism in general, but in film it surely has its place.  As for culture and society, I sorta look at the lens of \"cancel culture\" as \"accountable to your actions culture\", and am fine with daylighting sordid and ugly hidden secrets, etc. That sorta lays the groundwork here for me to have a nuanced reaction to some truly horrendous takes of this movie by film review / critics, etc. I am also \"woke\" in the modern sense that I care about inequality, the marginalized, and sorta just feel like we could all be nice to one another. I also think there's always a place for varied opinions that have different points of view or interpretations of art.\n\n\\*But holy cow\\*. These reviews made me realize I am missing some truly absurd and lost reviews on film subtext and narrative, and I would like to read more stuff like this. Really bad takes. Is there a subreddit for it, yet?\n\nTwo bad takes from this film:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) **Midsommar is about the female orgasm liberated. OMG**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;If we return to the film’s beginning, we find Dani pondering over whether she brings too much “baggage” into the relationship, if she’s too overwhelming, or too much. Being “too much” is a fear that has been incised into womens’ deepest insecurities since teenhood. Here, this insecurity manifests itself through a folk-horror tale, a generous genre film that literises abstract fears while employing allegorical storytelling to showcase sexual liberation. In this world devoid of intimacy, Dani’s reconciliation with herself is possible through firstly, experiencing universality in the ritual, then individuation in the newly attained status of hierarchy. Midsommar, then, starts off as a film about lack: the lack of love, or will to connect, but its insular experience ultimately serves a purpose that is cathartic, or even better, orgasmic. [https://www.girlsontopstees.com/read-me/2019/8/15/midsommar-orgasm-and-the-terrifying-feminine](https://www.girlsontopstees.com/read-me/2019/8/15/midsommar-orgasm-and-the-terrifying-feminine)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) **Dani has finally found a family. lol**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Like Us’s Adelaide, The Invisible Man’s Cecilia, The Witch’s Thomasin and Ready or Not’s Grace, Dani is joyful in her last moments on screen, finally released from her repression and taking control of her situation. Where Sally Hardesty maniacally laughed in Texas’s final shot, supposedly driven to insanity through the torture she’s endured, Dani placidly smiles, because like these other modern Final Girls, she knows she can’t return to what came before; and nor does she want to. While her decisions have ultimately left her unable to leave this new community, despite their violence and Pelle’s questionable behaviour, ***she appears at peace in the knowledge that she has found her people***. Her emotions are no longer ridiculed, and instead of burying them—a practice which Midsommar frames as negative through a somewhat cautionary tale—they are celebrated, respected...  \n&gt;  \n&gt;... While the Final Girl may still undergo disproportionate amounts of trauma in relation to the male characters, their characterization has seemingly evolved past the need for their pain to be their entire personality. Midsommar’s Dani knowingly smiles with a triumphant  satisfaction, and while we might feel conflicted as to why, we smile along with her.

        "title": "\"I Saw the Devil\" (2010) - A well-made South Korean thriller that is let down by its premise",
        "author": "MaggotMinded",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/10l7nuh/i_saw_the_devil_2010_a_wellmade_south_korean/",
        "text": "Spoilers ahead.  \n\n\n\\------  \n\n\n\"I Saw the Devil\" has a lot going for it. Fans of the macabre will appreciate the many glimpses of a world that is seemingly haunted by serial killers as the story takes us deep into the dungeons they inhabit and follows them out into their hunting grounds. Likewise, action junkies will have no trouble getting their fix from the surplus of fight scenes and brutal violence throughout. The performances from both lead actors are compelling, and the set design does wonders for the sordid subject matter.\n\nWhere it fails is the script. Despite the movie being nearly two and a half hours long, the plot is fairly sparse. A woman is killed and dismembered by a maniac. That woman's fiancé just so happens to be a special agent, and her father just so happens to be a retired police chief. So begins a vigilante plot to hunt down the serial killer who is responsible and make him suffer. This simple setup is more than enough to carry us through the first hour or so of the movie. For a brief shining moment it's almost reminiscent of *Memories of Murder,* another South Korean movie about the hunt for a serial killer using morally questionable methods. But when the grieving fiancé quickly tracks down the killer's lair and defeats him in the first of many violent confrontations, it almost feels too easy. There are no twists and turns in the investigation, no trail of clues to follow. Instead, he merely follows up on a list of suspects that the police have already compiled based on their criminal histories, and one of these suspects happens to be the killer. Likewise, there are no major complications when they face off for the first time. There are no tricks up the killer's sleeve, nor is he capable of escaping to fight another day. Our special agent hero has him dead to rights. We know that the movie cannot possibly end here, but what happens next is so baffling that it sets a terribly high bar for the remainder of the story to justify such a strange choice, and unfortunately the payoff just doesn't quite cut it. For you see, at this point the protagonist simply... lets the killer go. Not only does he let him live, he even leaves him with an envelope full of cash... but not before putting a tracking device inside his unconscious body.\n\nWe soon realize that the special agent is toying with the killer, playing a game of \"catch and release\" in order to prolong his vengeance. It is at this point that the story starts to lose its credibility. First of all, it's never explained why the protagonist thinks that such a risky plan is the best way of exacting revenge. If a quick death is too good for the man who killed your fiancée, then why not just hold him captive in his own dungeon and torture him the good old-fashioned way? The only explanation that makes any sense is \"because then the movie would be over\", and frankly, when a character makes a choice that prolongs a story unnecessarily it has a way of making everything that comes after feel cheap. Normally it would be a simple enough thing to overlook something like that for the sake of entertainment, but \"I Saw the Devil\" makes it incredibly difficult because at no point does the protagonist have any kind of a plan to prevent the damage soon to be caused by the serial killer that he has just turned loose. Sure, he follows closely enough behind him to save a few potential victims at the very last second, but all this tells us is that he doesn't care about their severe trauma as long as they survive their horrifying - and completely avoidable - ordeals. It would be one thing if he'd had every intention of being more or less responsible from the outset, and only allowed things to get out of control as his thirst for revenge gradually overtook his sense of caution, but no. As we watch the events unfold, all any rational person can think about is the fact that he had to have known this would happen, and was okay with it. The creators of the movie seem to have realized that this would pose a problem, and tried to mitigate it by having the killers first victims (post-release) be a pair of serial killers themselves so as to not arouse too much sympathy from the audience. However, the protagonist had no way of knowing this. For all he knows, the man he set loose has just killed more innocent people, and yet he does the same thing again later on. That's right, he captures the killer a second time, and once again has the opportunity to kill him or turn him over to the police, but again sets him free despite knowing full well that more innocent people will likely die as a result. As I have said before, there is nothing wrong with a story in which a man's need for revenge overtakes his better qualities, but in this case the devil is in the details, and the fact that he could have easily had his revenge without endangering countless others belies the purported theme that revenge is bittersweet and corruptive. I ask again (because it demands asking): what is wrong with just torturing the guy the old-fashioned way? It seems we're just supposed to go along with the idea that letting him go and hunting him down again is the ultimate form of revenge, but it's hard to roll with that premise when the movie is constantly showing us why that is an incredibly stupid idea.\n\nAdding insult to injury is the fact that the protagonist only seems to care about the collateral damage of his revenge plan when the killer targets his own loved ones (his late fiancee's father and sister). Up till then he was totally fine with seeing strangers get assaulted and murdered by the man he set free, and only when it starts to hit close to home does he begin to think that he may have made a mistake. What a great guy. And the worst part? Even after suffering some personal consequences of his own, he continues to callously involve perfectly innocent people in his convoluted plans. He captures the killer a third time, and instead of finishing it himself, he invites the killer's estranged family over so that they may unsuspectingly trigger the mechanism that finally kills him. This is presented as if it is supposed to be horrifying for the killer, a way of heightening his anguish in the moments leading up to his death. Besides the fact that we have been given no reason whatsoever to believe that the killer would care at all about the family he abandoned, very little attention is paid to what this would do to the three innocent people who now have to witness the gruesome death of a family member whose crimes they did not suspect. The protagonist is literally going out of his way to torment innocent people now, and yet the movie, along with those who give it glowing reviews, still seem to want to characterize it as a story of \"revenge gone too far\". I'm sorry, but I just can no longer buy that the character wasn't already a complete psychopath from the very beginning. It's not revenge itself that is ruinous, it's *this* revenge - this pointless, convoluted plan that was bound to backfire from the very start. \n\nI also don't think that I am somehow \"missing the point\", as if all these things were intentional. If the trauma inflicted upon the killer's family and upon his innocent victims is meant to be a crucial point with regards to the movie's overall theme, then why does the movie spend so little time on them? The victims themselves are little more than props in any of the scenes they are in, and there is no close-up of the killer's son's reaction to seeing his father's decapitated head rolling on the floor. Instead, barely three seconds pass before the scene cuts away and we're treated to a closing shot of the protagonist breaking down in tears as if his emotional turmoil is what really matters most in that moment. In truth, the movie cares just as little about the side characters as the protagonist does, and the message that revenge is bittersweet is delivered only through his perspective; the consequences for those around him barely even factor into it.\n\nOverall, the movie is a well-executed piece of entertainment, but these flaws in how the script handles its themes and character development are too distracting to really call this a \"great\" movie. Individual scenes are compelling on their own, but as a whole the movie does not do enough justify the premise of releasing the killer in order to continue hunting him, and the message falls flat as a result. If you can enjoy a well-shot, well-acted, and well-choreographed scene while ignoring the idiotic throughline that brought the story to that point in the first place, then you may like this movie more than I did, but if you care at all about the reasons why characters make the choices they do, then you may find yourself similarly let down by all the praise.",

The look and feel of it. \n\nIt’s Abel Ferrara’s second full-length feature, his first being a porn called *The* *9 Lives of a Wet Pussy*. He not only directed *The Driller Killer*,but starred in it as well. Ferrara was born in the Bronx, and it shows. The movie was filmed in Ferrara’s apartment in Union Square, just north of places like St. Marks, Alphabet City, and Soho. He undoubtedly spent a lot of time in these areas and places like The Palladium, CBGB’s, Max’s Kansas City, and The Mud Club. These were the haunts of the angry young artists, the angry young homosexuals, the angry young drug addicts, and the angry young punks. They were what was left after the optimism of the '60s collapsed. Along with all their anger came a lot of creative energy and willingness to take risks.\n\n*The Driller Killer* was like a net trawling through this roiling soup. It really wasn’t much of a slasher movie. There isn’t much suspense. No pretty blonde cheerleaders wandering down dark hallways. Most of the film is arguments.\n\nFerrara plays the lead character Reno, a hard-luck artist trying to finish his next painting so he can give it to his gallery and make some dough. Reno’s girlfriend Carolyn is impatient and tells him the painting is finished, and Reno yells,\n\n“It’s finished! Since when did you become such an expert of painting? I mean, you are telling me it’s finished? What do you know about painting anyway? Really, what do you know about painting? I’ll tell you what you know about painting, man. You don’t know nothin’ about painting. You know what you know about? You know how to bitch, and how to eat, and how to bitch, and how to shit, and how to bitch, but you don’t know nothing about painting, so don’t tell me about when it’s gonna be done. I’ll tell you when it’s gonna be done, and don’t worry about the money, man. I don’t care about that money. Alright? That’s all you talk about. That’s what the other one talks about. That’s all I hear from that fag art dealer uptown, and I don’t wanna hear it ‘cause the sound of that word drives me crazy!”\n\nI’m guessing the scene has an element of self-parody along with some genuine frustration. *The Driller Killer* is essentially a descent into madness film. There are some clear references to Roman Polanski’s *Repulsion,* one of which comes in the form of a skinned rabbit. In *Repulsion*, it is the alienation of apartment living that fuels the disintegration. In *The Driller Killer*, it is the disintegration of society.\n\nFerrara put together a fake punk band called *The Roosters* for the film, but after hearing them play throughout the movie, I would have been the first in line to buy their album, if one existed. The band was fronted by the charismatic Tony Coca-Cola and would have fit right in with *The Velvet Underground* or *Iggy Pop*. [**Punk**](https://filmofileshideout.com/archives/dave-markeys-two-punk-movies-about-the-lovedolls/) back then was somewhat split between the aggressive thumping of bands like *The Sex Pistols* and *The Ramones* on one hand, and the arty experiments of *Patti Smith* or *Talking Heads* on the other. *The Roosters*, like *The Velvet Underground*, fit somewhere in the middle.\n\n*The Driller Killer* has the coveted distinction of being one of the original 72 titles listed on the infamous “Video Nasties\" list compiled by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) in the United Kingdom. It was banned, which of course greatly increased its audience. It was smuggled from VCR to VCR along with the rest of the grindhouse catalog.\n\nAbel Ferrara’s next film was [**Ms. 45**](https://filmofileshideout.com/archives/a-comparison-of-i-spit-on-your-grave-the-last-house-on-the-left-and-ms-45/). It was filmed on the same gritty streets, but was more character-driven and a bit more polished. Eventually, Ferrara rose to prominence making films like *King of New York* (1990), *Bad Lieutenant* (1992) *Body Snatchers* (1993) which was nominated for the Palme d’Or, and *The Addiction* (1995) which was nominated for the Golden Bear. He has a strange and varied catalog.\n\nCurrently, he lives and works in Rome. He was raised an Italian Catholic. Much has been said about Catholic themes in his work, but frankly, it’s hard for me to see it in *The Driller Killer*. I found a quote from Ferrara that seems to sum up his weird mix of gutter and gusto.\n\n“All the great art is financed by the Church, so they have a monopoly on the paintings, and they’re powerful images, the whole nine yards of it. But Jesus was a living man, and so were Buddha and Muhammad. These three guys changed the fucking world, with their passion and love of other human beings. All these guys had was their word, and they came from fucking nowhere. I’m not saying Nazareth is nowhere – I’m sure Jesus came from a very cool neighborhood.”",

        "text": "The group I mean is Coppola, De Palma, Lucas, Scorsese, Spielberg.  I think they're an interesting group of filmmakers to talk about because of their legendary status and similar age but their career trajectories are wildly different. Scorsese and Spielberg are consistent in the quality of their output but differ in their mass appeal. De Palma and Coppola are usually seen as past their prime but have masterpieces under their belt that could contend for a place on the top 20 films of all time. Lucas is the most bizarre in terms of his career becoming more focused on production and being an idea man, but he had the vision for two of the most iconic film properties of the 20th century and 21st century that still affect us to this day.\n\nI think the perspective people have on these filmmakers tell a lot about a person's preferences, greatness or consistency, style or substance, subtle or expressive.\n\nPersonally, my favorite filmmaker of the group is probably Scorsese I really admire his consistency and that even when he misses, he set out to say something.\n\nMy favorite film from the group is Scarface, I can quote so many lines from it. It's full of memorable set pieces and amazing performances with an incredibly dynamic pathos and direction from De Palma. It has an intensity and pace no other film from the group matches in my opinion.\n\nFor significance Lucas is who I think made the biggest mark. Star Wars and Indiana Jones influenced the current culture of the MCU and the merchandising as well as branding of properties to an incredible amount.\n\nI'd also like to hear people's takes on the filmmakers they didn't mention and their hottest takes on the group. If you feel any other directors deserve to be put into this group that would be interesting too. This isn't meant to be combative; I just want to know people's favorites.",

        "text": "Is Pulp Fiction really about redemption in the religio-moral sense, as online commentary suggests?\n\nI just watched the film for a second time (the first time was a few years ago), and although I did notice details pretty obviously hinting at a theme of redemption that I’d missed the first time around (such as the ‘Grace’ decal on the Harley-Davidson), I still couldn’t see the film as making any kind of moral point.\n\nButch decides to save Marsellus, but surely the decision comes from both a moral place as well as a self-serving one. It is hard to believe that a man who, by his own admission, feels no remorse for having beaten his boxing opponent to death, and who has just murdered Vincent (although out of necessity) and attempted to run over Marsellus (again, out of necessity), turns over a new leaf in an instant. I think it’s valid to assume that his brief moment of indecision at the door of the pawn shop involves some consideration of the idea of being able to erase his debt to Marsellus by rescuing him. Plus, choosing to save a person from an ongoing rape despite future danger to oneself has to be the bare minimum to be expected from anyone with a semblance of a conscience. It’s hardly indicative of an abiding choice to change oneself. I thought ‘Grace’ was a clever and funny way of describing what has just occurred to Butch, because it is Marsellus the gangster, who has just vowed to “go medieval on” his assaulter, who is positioned as the grace-giving God here.\n\nAnother character who is said to have redeemed himself by leaving the evil world of crime is Jules. Vincent, conversely, is shot soon after he dismisses and ridicules Jules’ religious awakening. The essays I read on the film years ago agreed that the character’s fate revealed the film’s message, which is… redeem yourself while you have the chance! Don’t take signs for granted! Is that really the point someone like Tarantino and a film like Pulp Fiction that revels in violence would want to make? Once again, I thought there was a hint of amusing irony in the fact that this incredibly irreverent and subversive film ostensibly confirms a religious narrative. I thought it was just another one of the many ways in which the film subverts expectations. Plus, you must consider that Jules deliberates on divine intervention and on doing the “right thing” as he petulantly cleans up a young associate’s blood, without any real remorse for the life lost. The effect is comic.\n\nI think redemption most definitely is an obvious and important thread in the film, but not in a didactic, “see, choices are important!” kind of way, but in an ironic, funny, strictly narrative-serving way.\n\nI would love to know what established film critics have said about this theme in the film, as well as what the community here has to say.",

        "author": "thebluepages",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/10kilk1/on_the_recent_wave_of_fat_suits/",
        "text": "This will probably come across as some kind of \"woke\" rant, but there have been three movies that bugged me for the same reason - the use of fat suits and prosthetics along those lines. Those movies are The Whale (Brendan Fraser), The Batman (Colin Farrell), and Elvis (Tom Hanks).\n\nMy issue is most clearly demonstrated by Colin Farrell in The Batman. He's absolutely unrecognizable, and while it's a fine performance, I came away thinking - there are of plenty of actors that *actually look like that* \\- why not just get one of them? I know that the answer is pretty much just \"we want Colin Farrell's name on this\" and it's just such a bummer.\n\nHanks' prosthetics in Elvis were similarly distracting and unnecessary. I would still argue that, hey, just get someone who looks more like him if it's that important, but I get it, you want Hanks. Why add the giant neck? It doesn't make the movie better in any way, in fact Hanks is so cartoonish and weird looking (the accent doesn't help) I genuinely think he doesn't fit into the film - he actually hurts it. I genuinely think it's a bad performance, and would have been much better if he was allowed to look and sound more like himself.\n\nThe Whale is a much trickier conversation. Once again, while I would have loved Aronofsky to find an unknown actor of that size. I get why you want Brendan Fraser, there's a hell of a story there. But the fat suit just...isn't good enough. I don't care how respectful Aronofsky was trying to be, consulting with obesity groups and the like - the scenes where he's shirtless and stuff *don't look real*. I'm sure it's the best suit that's ever been made, but to me it doesn't work. Many shots look cartoonish, and feel exploitative for that reason, despite the intentions of the director.\n\nI do think you could draw a comparison between this and casting based on race. To me, if race is a central part of the character's identity, you cast someone of that race. If it isn't, you pick the best person for the job - but you don't put someone in blackface. Similarly, if obesity is central to the character, cast someone of that size - if it's not, don't get a smaller person and put them in a fat costume.\n\nI'm not overweight myself, so I'm not sure if my perspective is warped somehow - just been noticing it with these films and more. Would love some discussion on it.",
