How was his process?","author":"CartesianClosedCat","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/harrypotter\/comments\/11ptjca\/how_did_dumbledore_found_out_that_the_deathly\/","text":"I'm trying to figure out how Dumbledore learned that all Deathly Hallows were real objects (in the Wizarding World universe, of course). I am trying to make some sort of timeline in my mind.\n\nIn Deathly Hallows we see rationalist Hermione arguing with Xenophilius (lover of the strange, new-ageism, the occult and conspiracy) Lovegood.\n\nIronically, Xenophilius is right about the existence of these objects.\n\nIt takes Harry almost the whole book to learn about the true nature of the Deathly Hallows: they are real items, the Peverell brothers are probably the three brothers, BUT they likely didn't meet Death itself. It is a whole process.\n\nAs first-tim readers, in Hermione vs. Xeno, we are led to believe, or to follow Hermione, because we know she is smart and rational, and what we know from Xeno. She isn't exactly close-minded, like Xeno says. At the end of the book, we are led to believe Dumbledore's perspective on the Hallows, because he's Dumbledore. (We don't have reasons to doubt it)\n\nThat makes me asking myself that the process for Dumbledore probably wasn't straightforward as well.\n\nThe Elder Wand is the most visible object, one can follow its trace through history. Dumbledore and Grindelwald obviously know the story of the three brothers. They know the stories about the wand that is called the Elder Wand.\n\nBut why would they think that the other two Hallows are also real? Perhaps they didn't think so and only later Dumbledore learned that they are in fact real.\n\nJames Potter gives Dumbledore the invisibility cloak. Perhaps his 'curiosity' was that this object confirmed the existence of the second Hallow? I can imagine that this can be quite overwhelming for Dumbledore for a moment.\n\nAnd the same of the resurrection stone when he discovers in the house of the Gaunts, the confirmation that all Hallows are real.\n\nBut that would mean that his belief in the objects of the Deathly Hallows is fairly new (from the times with the ring that Tom Riddle weared or memory of the MoM official visiting the house of the Gaunts, basically when Dumbledore figured out that the ring is a Deathly Hallow from those memories).\n\nPerhaps Dumbledore guessedmuch earlier, and his educated guesses are usually right (like the horcruxes), that the objects are not fictional, but likely out there. Possibly dating from his times with Grindelwald. It is already implied in the King's Cross chapter that their correspondence was partly about research into the Deathly Hallows.\n\nI wish Fantastic Beasts went into the topic of how Dumbledore and Grindelwald learned about the Deathly Hallows. It seems like an interesting theme to explore (belief, rationality, believing in narratives), and it would connect the story partly to the Deathly Hallows. (I am not very well-versed in Fantastic Beasts, but I know that if should get into it, I should read the screenplays. But from the blog posts I've read, this was not something that was covered in these movies.)\n\nWhat do you think?","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1678663893.0},{"title":"How much did the wizarding world know of the events that took place during the battle of hogwarts and after","author":"Bigfoot_samurai","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/harrypotter\/comments\/11pqpji\/how_much_did_the_wizarding_world_know_of_the\/","text":"Was it revealed the elder wand was in play?

They rushed through the castle, killing the Muggle captors. However, Rowena discovered the castle set upon an intersection of Lei Lines. This made the castle an excellent location to setup a sanctuary for magics.   \n\n\nThe outrageous amount of people, beasts, and creatures astounded the group. Transporting everyone back to their original habitats and family was an insurmountable task. Therefore, Salazar, ever the diplomat and strategist, convinced the creatures and beasts to setup new homes in the areas surrounding the castle, ensuring protection of the castle and the surrounding grounds. Salazar negotiated the treaties and agreements for what would become Hogwarts Castle, the Forbidden Forest, and the Black Lake.   \n\n\nSalazar felt that additional protections were needed so that the wizard children would not be captured and experimented upon again. Godric Gryffindor disagreed, saying the treaties, agreements, and the castle itself would provide adequate protection. Hence, the building of the Chamber of Secrets. It would act as a panic room.   \n\n\nAfter separating from the other founders, Salazar traveled extensively throughout the world. He collated data concerning magical creatures and beasts.

I don't see Ginny hiding her feelings much though and Harry will know when she is annoyed at him.\n\nI don't think they would argue much but with the way Harry does tend to act they would once or twice a year have a really big argument, but it would still get sorted reasonably quickly. \n\nGiven that Ginny only works part time after having the kids I suspect she will be looking after the children more than Harry does when they are younger as Harry works full time at the Auror's office. Harry would love James, Albus and Lily though they would likely go to their mother to talk about how they are feeling. Harry would not be the best at dealing with them when they are upset.\n\nI think generally speaking Harry and Ginny would be quite happy together, Ginny reasonably happy as a part-time sports reporter, and half stay at home mother and Harry liking being an Auror. \n\nHarry and Ginny would enjoy talking to one another, Harry enjoying Ginny's sense of humour and just being around her feels natural, sort of like how it felt when he was around Ron when they were younger (though obviously in a very different way). There is no one Harry would be more relaxed around than Ginny.\n\n**Ron\/Hermione**\n\nI imagine that Ron is an Auror until Hermione gets pregnant with Rose, and Ron decides that as much as he likes being an Auror he doesn't want to risk dying and missing out on seeing his daughter grow up. He would join his brothers joke shop at that point. Before that though I imagine Ron and Hermione having an agreement that the person who comes home first cooks, and the person who comes home second cleans up.\n\nAs a result of his change in careers Ron will be the one who is home more than Hermione so it would be Ron who would tend to Rose and Hugo more often than not, him cooking their meals \n\nI see throughout their marriage Ron and Hermione bickering a lot, the bickering acting as a release valve so neither gets upset enough for there ever to be any major fights. \n\nI think Ron would be very supportive of Hermione's career and would be very proud of all she has accomplished. I think Hermione would love coming home and seeing her husband with their two kids and she would enjoy venting about her job to Ron for a while which would help her feel better.\n\nHermione might feel guilty that she does not raise Rose and Hugo as much as Ron does, but that is mostly because of the expectations on women by society. Ron himself would think Hermione is a great mother, even if she tries to plan her kids lives a bit too much.\n\nOverall I see Ron and Hermione really loving each others company as a married couple just like they did when they were kids at Hogwarts. \n\nSo that is what I think, what do you think?","upvote_ratio":0.62,"created_utc":1678534508.0},{"title":"What is the magical currency of Europe?","author":"mirabel8888","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/harrypotter\/comments\/11oedlf\/what_is_the_magical_currency_of_europe\/","text":"Quick question for something I\u2019m working on.

Draco. I think he should have had a moment where he sees just how horrible his bigoted views were and Hermione was the catalyst for it.

But they never beat him severely and I think that's why he never developed an obscurus. \n\nIf his abuse had been worse, do you think he might have developed an obscurus? \n\nWe know that Dumbledore's sister, Ariana, developed an obscurus, I believe due to abuse that she suffered at the hands of muggles who saw her perform magic.\n\nIn fantastic beasts, they mention that children who develop obscurus don't live past the age of 10, and Harry never got his letter until he was almost 11.

His younger self is the personification of the word \"ambitious\" and having him be in the \"bad guy\" house would have meant that they had at least got one good wizard and that Gryffindor did not hog all of the heroes in the series. Imagine him telling Harry about it as a counterargument to Harry talking about how evil the house is, thus cementing that the house does produce good people, it's only been corrupted by Voldemort.\n\nNow onto the topic, House Slytherin should have been dissolved. The main point of the series is how Slytherin basically became an eco-chamber for blood supremacy due to the fact that Voldemort's beliefs spread during his time there. And by the end of the series, this belief is gone and a child like Scorpius (who doesn't have those same beliefs) shows that they have moved on.\n\nI could totally buy the idea of reforming the house and \"taking the symbol back\" if it wasn't for the fact that it was literally made by Voldemort's personal hero, Salazar Slytherin. He had all of the same beliefs as Voldemort and the symbol of his House is literally a murder machine that killed a bunch of innocent muggles. Voldemort is Salazar's heir and the heir to House Slytherin which shows that it was flawed from the beginning.\n\nI believe that the series should have ended with Hogwarts dissolving House Slytherin and reorganizing it into House Dumbledore instead. Remove the name and remove the snake, both have origin in a racist who wanted to create someone like Voldemort, they did not even allow muggles in that House because the racism was so deeply integrated into the House's very origin. The House was literally made to spread pureblood supremacy to ambitious wizards, it's flawed from its inception.\n\nDumbledore represents the positive ways to use Slytherin traits:\n\n* A**mbition**: The ambition to become strong and fight evil\n* **Resourcefulness:** The willingness to look at a problem through a different lens\n* **Cleverness:** What's more clever than to think of a plan to defeat a dark lord?\n\nThese traits aren't bad, they are just easily corrupted and Dumbledore shows a person that was able to rise above that and become a great wizard. Having his name on the house changes the context of these traits from \"The Villains\" to something neutral and positive like the other Houses have.\n\nChange the snake to a phoenix to show that the house has been reborn from worshiping the symbol of the Basilisk, and change the name to show that the house rejects its past and that it is moving forward, leaving Salazar Slyhertin's memory behind. It would also be a fantastic way to honor Dumbledore since that family basically died out with him (because none of them had any children) and to show the children that are sorted into that house that their role model should be someone like Dumbledore rather than an evil D who represents everything that can go wrong with those personality traits.\n\nDumbledore was obviously not a perfect human being, he was flawed in a lot of ways (like everyone in the world is) but it would be a perfect way to show that the House rejects its origin and its past and that these traits are being treated as something positive rather than the foundation for evil.\n\nThis would obviously never happen since the iconicness of the house symbol and name is too ingrained into the series and popculture, but Rowling should have thought about that before she made the origin, symbol, and literal name of the house associated with evil. I could buy the idea of re-conquering the house if it didn't originate with a guy that was a massive D, there is nothing to take back because nothing was distorted, the purpose of the house was day one to find an heir that was willing to kill muggles.\n\nWhat do you think?

It seems that the absolute mayhem of Voldemort prior to the Mauraders joining the Order of the Phoenix is lost in the books and movies because it\u2019s explained in such a disjointed manner. This became a monster and is too long for a comment so I present to you: \n\n\n##The Complete History of Voldemort\n\n**Years**\n\n\n*Horcruxes* \n\n\n>Relevant character info outside of Voldemort\u2019s rise\n\n\nTiny tiny amount of background: His mother\u2019s family was the Gaunt\u2019s who were a direct descendant of Slytherin. He was conceived through a love potion she gave to a Muggle, Tom Riddle Sr. His mother died in childbirth. His wizard family was all incestuous and weird and stuff. He grew up in an orphanage with magic he couldn\u2019t explain and was like a sadistic bully. Alright, here we go!\n\nIn **1938** Tom Riddle is introduced to Albus Dumbledore and brought to Hogwarts. He was sorted into Slytherin, obviously, and could speak Parsletongue which should\u2019ve been a red flag immediately. Pureblood nonsense was all the rage at these times thanks to our boy Grindelwald and the publishing of The Sacred 28, a list of Pureblood families. \n\n**1939** Riddle returns to Hogwarts for his second year. Presumably he was still being a menace over the summer, but that\u2019s conjecture based on my opinion of him. This is also when he starts being a menace at Hogwarts, along with several of his dude bros that later become Death Eaters. Namely, what I shall refer to as \u201cThe Four Fathers,\u201d the fathers Lestrange, Malfoy, Rosier, and Avery. No this is not any of the dudes we know - they come later. \n\nAround **1940**, Tom Riddle finds out he\u2019s a half-blood and is like, super mad about it. He also finds out that he\u2019s a direct heir of Slytherin somehow, who knows, and he uses this to form his entire personality. He starts calling himself \u201cVoldemort\u201d and so do our four fathers and his other nameless band of delinquent friends. \n\nWhen Voldemort returns for his fourth year, **1941**, he\u2019s obsessed with learning more about his family\u2019s history, and the Dark Arts. In this time he learns about the existence and means of creation of Horcruxes. Hogwarts kept Secrets of the Darkest Arts around in the library for some damn reason we may never know. \n\nDuring the end of Voldemort\u2019s fifth year, in **1943**, all hell breaks lose. Voldy discovers the existence of the Chamber of Secrets and opens that bad boy up. He controls the Basilisk, some Muggle-borns get Petrified, and he kills Myrtle. He uses this murder to make his first Horcrux, which is the *Diary*. \n\n>Rubeus Hagrid is expelled from Hogwarts after being falsely accused of opening the CoS\n\nA few months later in the **summer of 1943**, Voldemort tracks down what remains of the Gaunts. They tell him basically that his dad sucks and it\u2019s all his fault, so Voldemort goes and kills all the Riddle family and frames Morfin Gaunt by implanting false memories. Then he swipes his ring (which is also The Resurrection Stone somehow), and uses that to create his second Horcrux - the *Gaunt Ring*. \n\nNow, after a very busy summer, Voldemort keeps the steam train that is **1943** a-rollin\u2019 and begins his sixth year at Hogwarts. Screw studying for your NEWTs or whatever the needs are doing, our man is a little busy planning world domination. To help with that, he taps his bff Horace Slughorn to find out if he could \u201ctheoretically\u201d create six Horcruxes - so, four more. He ends his sixth year in **1944**. \n\n Voldemort lays low for his seventh year. He does his thing and graduates Hogwarts in **1945**. \n\n>Dumbldore v Grindelwald smackdown happens in 1945\n\nNow, because Grindelwald left such a big gaping hole in the Pureblood Baddies league, Voldemort starts taking this opportunity to talk all that big game about Pureblood supremacy. He was always on board, but became more outspoken about it in between **1945** and **1946**. \n\nVoldy comes back to Hogwarts in **1946** to apply for the position of Defense Against the Dark Arts professor. Dippet is still Headmaster but Dumbledore pulls some strings and gets him to pump the breaks and tell Voldemort \u201cno thanks.\u201d Voldemort takes this time to charm The Grey Lady and find out that Ravenclaw\u2019s Diadem is in Albania. \n\nIn **1947**, Voldemort travels to Albania. While he is there, he tracks down the Diadem and kills a random in Albania in order to turn it into a Horcrux. He takes that back with him to England and thus we have the third Horcrux - the *Diadem.*\n\nFrom **1950** to **1961**, Voldemort is working at Borgin and Burke\u2019s. We don\u2019t know much about his time there except that he used it to build more followers and become better-known in the creepy circles he later runs. He meets Hepzibah Smith in **1955**. \n\nVoldemort finds out that Hepzibah Smith is the Heir of Hufflepuff fairly quickly. He brokers a lot of deals between her and Borgin & Burke\u2019s in the time he works there, and later finds out she\u2019s in possession of artefacts from both Slytherin and Hufflepuff in **1961**. How nice for him. Anyways, he poisons her and does his memory-implanting thing again, this time to Hepzibah\u2019s house elf. He walks with the next two Horcruxes - the *Locket* and the *Cup*. He makes them by killing Hepzibah and a random woman in London. We\u2019re up to five now.","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1678348951.0},{"title":"Moaning Myrtle is just about the most tragic character in the series","author":"peryno64","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/harrypotter\/comments\/11mcje9\/moaning_myrtle_is_just_about_the_most_tragic\/","text":"Imagine you're her parents.

I understand that the feasts are for special occasions, but even the every day meals in the great hall seem to consist of fattening foods (Hedwig is mentioned to frequently visit Harry at breakfast to have some bacon, and I certainly can't recall any salads being mentioned in any of the books). There doesn't seem to be any rationing, in fact I believe it's indicated that the food for the meals will keep spawning on the tables until people stop eating it. I find it very hard to believe that a bunch of preteen and teenage kids would be able to control themselves when presented with an infinite amount of delicious food every day, and there's never any reference to an attempt on the part of the Hogwarts staff to control or temper their appetites. Now, I suppose it's possible that Harry just never mentioned the health food meals that Hogwarts served most of the time, since we certainly don't see every meal. But beyond the issue of diet, Hogwarts has no physical education class or gym. The closest thing we get to a P.E. class is Quidditch, which most of the students don't participate in, and the health benefits and exercise achieved from a sport where you spend the entire time seated on a magic broom is highly dubious anyway. Transfiguration and Charms only exercise the student's wand arm, Astronomy, History of Magic, Arithmancy, Muggle Studies and Divination seem entirely sedentary, and Potions might have the occasional sweaty moment but it's not like students are having to lug heavy containers of supplies around. I can see Defense Against The Dark Arts, Care of Magical Creatures, and Herbology being occasionally physically strenuous, but emphasis on occasionally. So they're not getting their exercise in their classes either. And somehow, the kids all keep in what seems to be pretty great shape. Also, just to get the 'magic' explanation out of the way, there are most certainly overweight wizards and witches depicted in the series, so if there was a way to just magically keep in perfect shape I imagine they'd all be using it.","upvote_ratio":0.37,"created_utc":1678309044.0},{"title":"Why was Snape allowed to be a death eater if he was not a pure blood?

It performed what it was meant to with only the incantation.\n\nWe know about wandless magic and non-verbal magic, so we know that the wands and the words aren't necessary. We also know that sometimes magic can occur based only on intent or emotion (as seen in young wizards).\n\nI have explored this topic with my friends. Some scenarios we've come up with are:\n\n1) The words have power that is separate from the magic itself. Perhaps the earliest magical blooded individuals were involved with the creation of language? This could be a similar concept to the Taboo placed on the name \"Voldemort\", or the magic used to operate the Trace.\n\n2) Harry's intent to cause harm to Draco was just so strong in the moment that it somehow met the requirements of the spell.\n\n3) magic forms a network that the can be accessed by magical creatures and items. This network can be influenced by strong enough will, and grows more powerful over time.\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts on this.

He is an eccentric witch who has gained fame over the years by stealing the history of powerful witches by erasing their memories with one of his only abilities which is the memory spells. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI find him very shrewd with a great desire for adventure and recognition, but cowardly and lazy and prefers to live a facade of who he really wanted to be than to practice time to be a really powerful witch with the potential he has. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe has deservedly been ostracized as a pathetic and despicable character, both in the book world and in real life by fans. But I can't help but see his qualities. A lot of his advice to Harry is practical and wise, plus he's smart enough to be a great writer. One of my favorite lines comes from him, \"Fame is an unfaithful friend, celebrity is what it makes it.\" Ironic, coming from him. This quote means that fame is fickle to be comfortable in it, and that you are the result of your attitudes, and they come from hard work and meaningful accomplishments. In the end, actions are always worth more than intentions or words. Which highlights to me that Gilderoy was not delusional, but in the end preferred to receive the glory without the prior effort, and like a good slacker, prefers the path of least resistance by improving the one skill that is probably most innate to him (memory spells) and using it to steal other people's stories and maintain his hard earned fame, which are pleasurable activities in themselves for him, rather than striving in less pleasurable paths\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was rated ravenclaw in most tests; and in my opinion, Gilderoy is the epitome of the worst that Ravenclaw can present. No, I don't think he would fit better in any other house, and he has innate qualities that make him valuable to Ravenclaw; as well as anyone else. I his background, Gilderoy was a smart but lazy student, not a bad witch, but he didn't value work and concrete attitude in the real world than abstractions of virtues and achievements. Desiring fame, thinking about values; none of that is wrong, but none of his virtues were directed to the field of will, which drives action; and I'm afraid Ravenclaw has more potential for that defect than any other house. It is not so much intelligence that counts for this house, I believe, but a great spirit and a mind ready for abstraction and higher thoughts. This is somehow related to fluid intelligence, but it would be kind of strange to assume that intelligence alone is one of the main factors for house choice. Not least because it would be a zero-sum game, the more intelligent students would be sorted into that house over the other houses, since the number of students in each house tends to be uniform; and we know that Ravenclaw doesn't stand out much in academic potential within Hogwarts than the other houses. Ravenclaw at the end of days is not a house of very feasible and practical members.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the end, each character in the series has innate virtues and defects, as well as desires that qualify them for their respective house. I see many comments saying that what really matters is what you value; but much of our desires are reflections of our innate personality and potential; we cannot arbitrarily choose what we desire. But the moral of Harry Potter is that at the end of the day, it matters little your innate qualities, but your attitude; which is evidenced by the similarity between Harry and Tom Riddle.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut that's it, folks. This epiphany occurred to me, and I wanted to share it with you. There are so many negative comments about Gilderoy, that I would like to state my more or less impartial point of view about him, and how many ravenclaws can identify with his faults.","upvote_ratio":0.56,"created_utc":1678232206.0},{"title":"I always wonder what Dumbledore meant when he said Harry escaped the appalling damage Vernon and Petunia inflicted on Dudley.","author":"Reddit_Survivor9","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/harrypotter\/comments\/11lum6r\/i_always_wonder_what_dumbledore_meant_when_he\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.38,"created_utc":1678277001.0},{"title":"What school did Barty Crouch Jr put on Harry\u2019s piece of parchment?","author":"SkullRiderz69","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/harrypotter\/comments\/11le4cb\/what_school_did_barty_crouch_jr_put_on_harrys\/","text":"I know we don\u2019t really know, but he bewitched the goblet to think there were 4 schools and Harry\u2019s names was entered under the fourth school to guarantee he gets chosen.
