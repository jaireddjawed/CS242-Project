        "text": "Long story short but I live in a very old former girl's orphange (yep) and it is known for having a lot of ghost activity (lots of people have seen ghosts and strange figures, animals freak out when they get too close the building, there are a lot of strange noises and other things etc) I know that there are very weird things going on but recently something has happened that I just don't understand.\n\nA friend, who was staying over, one morning was awake in bed just relaxing while scrolling on her phone when all of a sudden she noticed that something was lying on the bed next to her. It was a transparent white figure and it got up and it starred at her with a curious expression on it's face as it slowly dissapeared. The figure looked like her. It's as if she was looking at an identical version of herself but as a ghost.\n\nI don't know what it means but we've never had anyone experience anything like this (as far as I know) people have seen the ghost's of little girls and heard footsteps walking up and down the corridoors (the room she was in seems to be particually haunted) but this seems quite different. My friend who this happened to is an Atheist and a scientist and she doesn't believe in ghosts. She doesn't know what she saw but she's just trying to forget about it.\n\nCan anyone explain this? Or at least, has anyone heard of this happening before?",

        "text": "Hi, again not sure if this belongs here, and if not, just let me know I'll delete it.. I posted years ago on another sub and people mentioned that it wasn't quite synchronicity...\n\nThe day my son was born, it started as a natural birth as doctors for some reason push for that as the preferred delivery method.. after a few hours of labour, I saw the clear face expression the doctor made and wife was rushed into cesarean because the baby was already stressed and agitated and it was clear the baby wasn't gonna be born via natural birth.\n\nSurgery goes as planned, they wrap the baby and put him on my arms... I take the baby to my wife, who was having way too much fun with the anesthesia, and then the nurses say they need to weigh him, etc.. standard procedure...\n\nAs I am contemplating the miracle of life, I and the nurses notice the baby is turning blue, stops moving, crying, and breathing.. I m in shock watching this transpire and how professional the medical team is , they simply react and do their job. After a few minutes, baby is back at crying and doing baby stuff,...\n\nAfter almost 48 hours, I get a small window to go down to the cafeteria and get some food and sit down. On the way back to the room, there is a little kid who could had not been older than 6. As we get to their floor, which is before mine, the little kid turns around and tells me: \"say hi to Nikolas, Nikolas is there...\" , Frozen, the doors closed and couldn't get any more details about what he meant....\n\nThat's my son's name and even when I can totally see it as a random coincidence, it's really stuck with me all this years.... \n\nAnyways, just wanted to share and see if there's been any similar experiences, and or if it's considered \"paranormal\" enough... \n\nThanks",

I do not know, BUT I am obsessed with the movie The Shining especially the ghostly twins in the Overlook Hotel hallway.  Love both movie versions from Kubrick and King. I am a good person in many ways, intelligent etc.  I have The Shining Twins art, posters, many autographed photographs, figures, cups and so on. Maybe because I am SO OBBESSED with The Shining Twins and the movie (played by actresses Lisa &amp; Louise Burns) that I had the following reaction. I encountered 2 twin ladies the other day.  Walking infront of me about 20 feet away. When I crossed paths with these two, middle aged, identical twin ladies at Walmart (that actually kind of looked like the actresses Lisa &amp; Louise Burns as adults) I briefly talked with them wishing them a Happy New Year; I almost jumped out of my skin! LOL  I was very surprised to abruptly come face to face with them. Much like Danny perhaps! NO fear at all just \"hey where have you been ... I have been looking for you for the longest time?\" LOL. I want to have a paranormal experience like this. It would be SO way cool! Maybe a good psychologist or witch or spiritualist or other professional may have more insight why I am so obsessed. De Javu  - **phenomenon of feeling as though one has lived through the present situation before Overlook Hotel**.   Any SINCERE replies, explanations, interpretations and questions appreciated. Happy New Year 2023 everyone! Thanks much. :)  Shine on!",

In this summer 2022 my sister (20) started hanging out all night with her friends and since we have the room shared together I was alone at night. At the beginning it was just fun, I stay up all night when Im alone watching videos of creepypasta or stuff like that. All of my dreams are Nightmares, since I was a baby. I clearly remember my first nightmare and recently to that day in summer I had a dream were I was alone at home and I heard a feminine voice calling my name right behind my bed and under it, when I turned I saw a figure of this woman or girl with big eyes almost red and big black pupils staring at me. She didn't had a mouth or do anything, just stare at me. \nThe nights after that nightmare, everytime my sister wasn't there I heard that voice calling my name behind my bed. It wasn't just that, I thought it could've been my immagination, but I heard the air of a whisper right in my hear, like someone that really whispered my name in my ear. After that first time I heard it, I kept hearing it 'till this night. For the rest of the night that day I saw shadows everywhere, I don't think that was just imagination, or a dream. When she calls me, if I fall asleep I'll dream about weird stuff, static images, screaming, and dreams about me eating humans with a lot of gore. I clearly hear it and I can't do nothing about it. Sometimes I hear a loud crying \nIn the apartament above mine, also a piano playing, but nobody lives there. I also heard a name hearing those loud crying, Zoey or Zoe. Do you guys think I'm just imaginating it?",

When I was a kid, I was playing in my brother and sister's room back where we used to live. They were at school, I was still young enough to not have to go to school. I suddenly look at the doorway and see a completely black figure peaking in. It was weird because where it was peaking, there was maybe 2-3 inches between the doorframe and the end of the hall. Physically impossible for anyone to be there. I look away, not afraid of it, then look back, it's gone.\n\n2. When I was a teenager living where I live now, me and my brother shared a room and we were talking about something, I don't remember what. He had this white binder on top of the dresser, and it was flat on top, nowhere near the edges. Suddenly it flies off, scaring the shit out of both of us. I could never explain that one.\n\n3. Back to the first place of living, I remember vividly I was following this kid with a bag on his head. I was trying to talk to him, but he just ignored me. He proceeds to climb into the oven without opening it, which shut me right up. Now, granted, this could have just been one of the many schizo dreams I used to have back then. But it's weird because the house wasn't like distorted or in any weird arrangement. Only thing weird was, obviously, the bag-headed kid.\n\n4. A pen was thrown at my mom once, and we were mad at each other about something so she thought I threw it. When she realized I was serious that I didn't throw it, she went quiet. Nobody else was around except my dad, but the pen didn't come from his area of the living room.",

        "text": "I just had my second paranormal experience. As I was heading down to 1 of 3 basements in my house (house has been added on to several times) I was at the top of the stairs looking down and I saw the shape of a head peeking around the corner of the wall, I stared at it for a good second and then it quickly retreated. It wasn’t a “shadow person “ seen out of my peripheral, I was looking straight at it. No face, just a void in the shape of a head. The lights were off, but there are windows in this basement and it is day time so I could clearly see some of the workout equipment down there, this was not my eyes playing tricks in the dark. It was right at the bottom of the stairs peeking around the wall up at me, and I watched it move backwards to disappear. This is the second time I’ve seen a peeking apparition in a basement of my house. The first time was about 6 years ago having a sleepover with my best friend in a different, windowless, pitch black basement in the middle of the night. The door was closed, and then it slowly opened just enough for a head to pop in and look right at us for almost a solid minute, silhouetted by dim light from a lamp we always leave on upstairs. We both lifted our heads and looked at it. Again, couldn’t see a face just the silhouette. I figured it was my mom checking on us and said “Mom? …… Mom? … Mom?” with no response, and then it slowly retreated and the door closed. We didn’t hear footsteps coming down or going back up the stairs. Next day I asked my mom why she didn’t answer me and she said she did not come down to check on us. No one else was in the house. These are the only two times I’ve ever experienced something like this. I’ve had spooky feelings before in certain places (including my basements)but these peeking apparitions were undeniable, tangible experiences that stand out to anything that’s ever happened or spooked me. Both times I’m 100% certain of what I saw as I was looking directly at it. None of my family members have ever seen the peeker, just me twice now (and my best friend the first time). I have a lot of questions. Why me? Is it just curious and harmless? Should I be afraid? Do we need to take any action for my family’s safety? Would it be a mistake to try and talk to it? What is it…? I’m also interested in others stories, but more than anything, I would like to see some actual research, documentation or best of all ~literature~ on this specific phenomenon.",

(I have had experiences in the basement before as a child— when I was 5 I went down there waiting for my mom to come down and a deep growling voice— which was multiplied into many yelled through the walls. It cussed at me and called me names— I didn’t know any of the words that were used at the time.) another experience in the house was that same voice, this time singular, in my bedroom. It came from the ceiling and said “Lie”—- so being a child a lied down in my bed. And said “like this?” And is just let out this agitated sigh/growl. And that was it. \n\nNow last night. I’m on the phone sitting on the couch. I get up to go use the bathroom. When I come back the cushion that supports the back (quite large) is on the other side of the L shaped couch. I’m creeped out so I grab my stuff and my phone and go upstairs immediately. I think why would I do that? Maybe it was me— whatever. I realize I forgot something downstairs. So I’m like okay, I’ll go down and get it, it’s fine. As I walk down the stairs I joke to myself- wouldn’t it be fucked up if it was right back where it should be. And it was. I’m positive I didn’t move it back bc I was so freaked out I grabbed my stuff and ran upstairs. I had horrible sleep last night, and I don’t know much about this stuff, but I was just waiting till morning listening to music all night. The one time I look at the clock— I think wouldn’t it be fucked up if it was 3:33 and yep it was on the dot. \n\nNow I don’t know if I’m just freaking myself out, if it’s forgetfulness and coincidence, or actually something going on. I’m the only one in my home to ever experience stuff like this and also the only one who is afraid. What could this mean—- why would something do that? Also all my passed grandmothers things are in the basement, her art, clothes, her bed. But this didn’t feel familiar or like her.",

Everyone who has lived or stayed in that house has had some kind of experience happen my relatives tell me stories all the the time. \n\nSo I was around 10-11 and me and my two siblings slept in the same room. My brother woke me up at night sacred because the door to our room opened by itself he saw it happen. I looked and the door was open (we always kept it closed) . I didn't believe him at first and told him to go back to sleep and its just the wind probably. He said he's scared and asked that i close the door. I got up and closed the door a bit annoyed and turned on the TV so he could go back to sleep. I was watching the TV with him when the door opened again and this time we both witnessed it happen. I sat up and called out to my aunt and her husband who we were living with at the time but no one answered. I got up to closed the door and looked in the hallway that was pitch black i couldn't see anything and closed the door. My brother was scared so i lied and told him that it was the wind so he could fall asleep. I couldn't sleep tho. I was sure i saw the handle moving and the door being pushed open halfway. When we woke up we asked everyone if they went to the bathroom at night and opened our door by accident (the bathroom is right across from our room? Everyone said no and that was that. Now almost 10 years later we still talk about it my brother remembers this differently than i do. He said that he saw that the hallway light was on and he could see it peeking out from under the door even when i got up to close it twice. I told him that i don't remember the light being on and that the hallway was black. It was all in all a wired night and since then i am kind of scared of that stuff. My relatives say it couldn't be anything bad since no one has lived in the house before other than our family and maybe it was just a family member visiting us and checking on us. \n\nSo not sure what happened but wanted to post this even if this is a small experience it was scary for me and i think about it a lot. There were other things but this is the only one i remember in more detail.",

        "text": "It had been a few years since this spirit visited me, but last night reminded me of all those horrifying nights as a kid. \n\nMy paranormal experience seemed insignificant to me as a child, but as I shared them with others, I often got weird looks and concerning comments. These visits occurred pretty often as a kid and teenager, but I'm in my 20s now.\n\nRecently, I've been visiting my grandparents down in Florida for the past few nights. My dad and I had to share a room, separate twin beds. He is pretty old and gets up to use the bathroom a lot. I had a very strange and vivid dream (very common for me) that I was in a car that was driving itself while I was in the passenger seat. I escaped the car, but it turned around and chased me. When I woke up in the middle of the night, I opened my eyes and peeked through the bottom of my eye mask. I saw what I thought to be my father walk from our bed sides to the door, to use the restroom. But when I lifted the mask to check on him, my father was sound asleep in his bed a few feet from mine. \n\nThe dream itself was enough to make me wake up with the feeling of fear, but the feeling of some sort of presence added to it. This feeling is familiar to me, so I knew it really wasn't anything to be worried about, as nothing actually BAD has really happened from it. I turned in my bed to get comfy and go back to sleep, but then my bed started rocking. It felt like someone was manually pushing the side of it, like a shaking you'd get almost on a boat? I'm really not sure how to describe it other than quite unsettling. It's significant enough to keep me awake, mostly from fear of \"what the fuck is shaking my bed\".\n\nI eventually calmed myself down and the shaking rocked me back to sleep, oddly enough. I woke up this morning recalling all the times this occurrence used to happen in my childhood.\n\nI brushed off these events as a kid because... well nothing ever really came of them. I'd wake up at night and either be rocked back to sleep, or I'd feel someone touching my back, or other times I'd hear their breath. Sometimes, I'd wake up so paralyzed with fear that I was too scared to move with that presence feeling. It would happen in different locations, beds, houses, and even hotels. So whatever it is doesn't seem to be attached to the location but to me, I suppose.\n\nI'm not well versed in paranormal events, spirits, ghosts, and whatnot.. So I figured maybe someone here could have a theory as to what's going on. My running theory is that some dead relative is trying to comfort me. I was adopted from a very bad household situation out of the country, so I'm not in touch with any blood relatives.\n\nFor ease of writing, I'll refer to this as a spirit for now.\nDo spirits follow individual people? Is there someone I could seek that could help identify this spirit and bring some ease of mind to me? Is the overwhelming fear I feel justified?",

        "text": "Hey everyone, today I decided to share my story and experience with sleep paralysis I had some years ago. (2017/18 - not sure exactly)\n\nSo basically, it had started way before this when I was around 8 or 9, the first time I had sleep paralysis it was in the apartment I was living in where I had fallen asleep during the day after school to rest, it was a bunk bed because I see weird stories about these, anyways I suddenly opened my eyes and in front of me I see clearly a woman dressed as a nurse holding a god damn syringe 💉 in her hand and looking at me straight in the eyes, she sprayed the syringe around a bit and then I woke up, terrified to death but yeah.\n\nAnyways, a while after that I kept having random scary dreams but not any paralysis, however back in 2017/18 not sure of the year exactly I started experiencing sleep paralysis again, it started with somebody breathing close to my face and then somebody hovering above me during night, then I kept seeing small kids entering my apartment and all the weirdest shit you can imagine, and let me emphasize that this kept on going for around 20 days to a month, basically whenever I was going to fall asleep I knew I’d have sleep paralysis and was prepared for it, one night I remember I had it and then woke up and was so tired that I fell asleep and then had it again, twice in a god damn night!\n\nAnyways, I was looking around trying to find a way to get rid of it because it was tiring and exhausting me and then came upon a video of this Islamic preacher, I am muslim by the way however all the prayers to that point before sleeping somehow didn’t help me, and this guy simply said this, whenever you experience sleep paralysis (usually it wakes you up around 2/3 oclock), simply wake up, clean yourself (we call it wudhu) and wait for the morning prayer, and just pray.\n\nBackground story why the prayer, we muslims believe jinns attack us at night and cause sleep paralysis and they do not like prayer and whatever is related to it.\n\nSo basically, the day I heard this I went to sleep and of course once again as expected, the lovely jinn woke me up, I got up and did wudhu and waited for like an hour or two for the morning prayer, funny thing was - I went into the bathroom and the damn shower head fell down by itself without me touching it and broke, believe me or not I know it sounds damn weird.\n\nAnyways, I prayed and fell asleep, it’s been a couple of years now and no sleep paralysis until now, had some weird dreams but they are nothing compared to sleep paralysis! (Those who experience/d sleep paralysis know.)\n\nI wanted to share this because I have only told my family members about this and I am not sure all of them believe me but hey let this be here, maybe some of you have sleep paralysis stories.\n\n(Please keep in mind, this is my experience and I am not sharing this to promote religion or my beliefs, respect to everyone and stay well and healthy!)",

I can list a few reasons behind this belief of mine.\n\nI have a vague memory of having a dream of some creepy face looking at me, and I apparently had this dream when I was just a little girl. Also, whilst doing something on my phone, I heard masculine-sounding laughter coming from under my bed. At one point, I was woken up by a hissing noise, and another time, I was woken by a voice yelling “WAKE UP AT 5:13!” When I checked the clock, it was exactly 5:13  in the morning. This final reason may seem a little humorous, but one time during dinner, my Alexa randomly started blaring the ‘This is The Beatles’ album at full volume, and Dad had to come to my room to turn it off.\n\nRecently, I’ve been linking these events to some demonic entity. Am I being haunted? Is a demon stalking me? Please let me know.",

        "text": "There's a famous quote that goes, \"In the beginning, Man created God\". And I get it: the darkness is scary. I mean to them, not me, I feel alive after the sun goes down. I rather like the darkness. But the darkness I'm actually referring to is death, not just the absence of light. The idea that we're all alone and that this is it, is truly frightening. Religion tries to make sense of that and create order from chaos. It comforts people believing if they follow the rules, there's an afterlife waiting for them. And if they don't follow the rules, even though it's described as unpleasant, there's *still* an afterlife waiting for them (bring sunscreen). \n\nI have had experiences in my life that led me to believe there is something else. I can't say scientifically they were ghosts, but I can't say it wasn't, either. But the logical part of my brain says it wasn't, there has to be another explanation. When my grandfather died, my father's pocket-watch stopped at the exact time of his death. I can't really explain that. And my maternal grandmother once went to a séance where details about a neighbor's death from years prior were revealed that was just so out of context at the time it freaked her out a little. The problem for me is like with religion, all we really have is faith that it exists. It can't really be quantified or qualified. There are no peer-reviewed studies offering proof. \n\nI like to think that since time appears to be circular, with the past-present-future existing at the same time in space-time, that even if you do die you do still have immortality somewhere else in the timeline. I've even wondered if it's possible that when you die your consciousness just goes back to a previous point on your timeline. Like a replay for eternity. Or maybe you jump to a different version of our universe and that's why we have things like Deja Vu. \n\nBut I'm more on the skeptical side of things now. I used to love books by people like Hans Holzer, I met Lorraine Warren years ago, I was into all of it. But now I want to go spend the night at the Amityville house, or room 1408 if they have one anywhere, or Room 217, or anywhere else that has that kind of  reputation. Just to see. Or visit Dudleytown. It's in my state. And the reason being even if something bad happens it's proof of something supernatural, right?\n\nThere is another option no one considered: what if ghosts are real, but have nothing to do with us? What if they're just another form of life existing at the same time in the same place as us, but maybe on a slightly different dimension?",

I was sure it was alright, including the fact that I was alone. I would occasionally hear a tapping sound or a click on the hallways, though I knew it wasn't a mouse trap, I thought I was just anxious. It wasn't until I saw shoes walking that I started to doubt it. I knew the house originally belonged to my sister's dad, and that he passed away bit I never really thought I would be a victim of something paranormal. It's why I agreed. The shoes were the size of an adult man, black without a reflection at all. I thought someone had broke in, so I was quick to check. Only to see nothing, not even a shadow. I took Leah (My sister's dog) outside and sat for a while. When it seemed safe, I went back in the house and I didn't speak of it when I was back home.

I’m not sure exactly what time it happened at, but it likely would have been sometime during the night between the 3rd and 4th. \n\nAround 4:00 am on the 4th, I woke up with really unbearable heartburn/indigestion and ended up in the bathroom for quite a while feeling extremely sick. At one point I even woke my boyfriend up in tears because of how uncomfortable the heartburn and stomach pain was. I also texted my mom to say I thought I had food poisoning. Eventually it let up and I was able to fall asleep, and by the next day I felt totally fine. \n\nOn the 5th, I found out he had died. I have been certain that my body had known he was gone and that was why I had gotten so sick out of nowhere. It especially made sense because we were always very connected; the kind of connection where you’d be thinking of them randomly and they’d call at that exact moment. Today I was looking through my Snapchat memories and remembered I had saved a video of the lights flickering like crazy while I was in the bathroom that night. I don’t even know why I saved it and I had totally forgot that it had even happened until today. It had never happened before that and hasn’t happened since, and we haven’t changed the bulb or anything. In my mind, there’s no way that wasn’t him saying goodbye or visiting me one last time. \n\nI don’t know if this was the right place to post this, but I wanted to share it with people who might understand.",

No information on their character or reputation as people. So 30 years ago my parents bought a house that 100+ years old, detached &amp; a good distance from the next neighbour.. suburban but also a bit away. Before they moved in the house, the neighbours were having work done &amp; our house at the time was forgotten and derelict, the builders said to the neighbours they saw their elderly neighbour (from our now current house) walking down the garden arm in arm &amp; it was very sweet - neighbours were quick to confirm to the builders nobody has lived there for over 14 years so it couldn’t be possible. \n\nMom and dad move in with my 2 older brothers. Things started to happen, nothing malicious, more a cheeky way. I.e objects around the house would go missing and then reappear in the most bizarre places, footsteps above, doors shutting, footsteps running up and down the stairs.. these are to name a few &amp; with very minor details attached to them. If you are in the house alone, you hear what could only be described as someone dragging a piano from the attic, dropping it &amp; repeated getting louder until you have to leave the house. Anyway, with all this happening my dad was a solid ‘non believer’ at the time. I guess most would say it was sleep paralysis, however this happened a few nights in a row &amp; my dad would see an elderly gentleman with loads of ‘crates’ in his face standing at the end of his bed. My mum loves the dna&amp; history stuff &amp; found out the husband who lived here before (widower) passed away abroad &amp; had acne very badly causing severe scaring in his face. Anyway, trying to cut a huge story very short this stuff happened up until my mum and dad divorced. Dad stayed in the house &amp; extended it &amp; things stopped happening so much &amp; then gradually nothing. \n\nFast forward 15 years later, I now live here along with my 2 other brothers &amp; their own families (house is fairly big &amp; open planned so it doesn’t feel like we live upon each other). 4 months ago I was home alone &amp; my bedroom is situated downstairs opposite the stairs - I heard someone running up and down the stairs, constantly about 5 times but the last time never coming back down. Reminder everyone was not in the country not possible to be a family member. Since then everyone is experiencing the slamming of doors, the dragging sounds &amp; large footsteps. We had my SIL brother stay over during Christmas, now the house  is opened planned &amp; we don’t want to be spooking him so we didn’t tell him about the recent creepy noises. 2 nights he stayed, he told us the first night he had dragging and load footsteps above him (not possible) &amp; the second someone was going up and down the stairs so much he had to check if it was one of us. \n\nSo in all there is around 7 of us living here (some inc separate from the house) &amp; everyone is hearing these dragging and awful sounds from family to guests. I’ve heard thuds &amp; truth be told a believer. \n\nBut I don’t understand why I am not hearing the dragging noises but my family are? And also why has this started again after so many years of nothing? Is it bad is it good? \n\nFor context I (25/f) live with my brothers &amp; dad &amp; their other halves. Other halves have experienced the negative happenings (dragging, bolts locking), my dad has but not so much me &amp; my other brother who live in the house.",

        "text": "So bear with me, this is my first post in this sub and to be completely honest, my first truly unexplained paranormal moment ever in my life. Not sure if there's etiquette or whatever for the recanting of the story so forgive me if so. I'm posting here because I need to share but if I tell my wife she'll be freaked out and it isn't worth it. \n\nBackground, we have a near-3 year old child, and we are still using an AV monitor in his room. It has night-vision of some kind and we use it mostly for the audio in the middle of the night if he has a nightmare, etc. Also important is the fact that we have a white noise machine (and night-light double) in his room, which makes a low to medium-level of constant white noise. \n\nOn mornings where it is my turn to get up with him, I get up 30 minutes earlier than he does (he's an incredible sleeper, so it's predictable, grateful to my wife for the sleep-training!) to use the bathroom and shower. Important note: our bedroom is adjacent to the kid's room, and the house, being not terribly new, is not soundproof between rooms. The master bathroom is directly connected via an air vent, and so I can hear him talking/laughing/singing from his room in the bathroom without any monitoring or other aid. \n\nSo I'm sitting in the bathroom in that time before he wakes up. He wakes up and starts doing the usual self-soothing while he waits, which consists mostly of songs and little stories that he tells himself (it's actually adorable to listen to). He's used to me doing my bathroom routine before getting him, presuming he wakes up before I'm done, so at this moment I know I have about 20 minutes or so before he gets impatient. \n\nOk, background over, here's the story: suddenly the monitor stops emitting the sound of his voice. What it *is* still emitting is the white noise of sound machine. That's not strange in and of itself, except that I'm sitting next to the air vent between the rooms and I can *still hear him singing.* I'm momentarily sort of amused and confused so I turn on the monitor to look at the video, and he's lying there awake, still and without his mouth moving (but looking otherwise normal, blinking and such). I'm getting more and more generally confused and a little weirded out as I watch. His mouth is *not* moving, I verify multiple times, on the video. The monitor is playing the sound of the white noise but is not transmitting the sound of his voice, which I can hear specifically continuing to sing because I'm sitting next to the air vent. \n\nThat goes on for probably 2 minutes with me just frozen in some sort of awe and confusion, not necessarily \"hairs standing up\" freaked, but just like wtf is happening. Then the sound of his singing comes back through the monitor and whatever this episode was is over. I'm disappointed to admit that I can't remember whether I was necessarily looking at the monitor or not when his voice returned to the monitor, there was just a lot going on in my brain at the moment and I don't have that detail recalled. \n\nSuffice it to say, this was a relatively innocuous \"paranormal\" moment, but for me it's a first and totally unexplained. I saw him lying there quietly on the video, with the monitor ONLY playing the sound of the white noise machine, but heard him distinctly singing through the air vent adjoining the rooms. It's like there was a momentary split of the universe and then it rejoined. I don't know. Anyway, I had to tell \"someone,\" even if only a few people read. \n\nP.S. wasn't sure what flair was appropriate so I used \"debunk this\" because honestly I hope that's what happens here.",

The next day I was up and dressed and ready to go when my roommate coded - her daughter screamed for help and as all this went down I immediately became sick.  My heart started pounding like crazy, I became very dizzy, disorientated and sick to my stomach, I was also sweating profusely.  I had to get out of that room.  I ran out as fast as I could and as soon as I was in the hallway I felt better.  I waited in the nurses station while the nurses fetched my stuff and I was released shortly after.  A few days later as I read the sundays paper I saw my roommates obit.  She died the day I was released.  Coincidence or paranormal?",

        "text": "Processing a childhood paranormal experience that's been haunting me\n\nI have told this story many times before, but never to anyone who had knowledge of different entities. Now that I've learned more about spirits, I would be interested to hear any interpretations.\n\nMy mom told me the story when I was a kid. Apparently when I was a toddler, I was sleeping in bed with my mom. She got sleep paralysis and saw a black figure staring down at her - she said it looked darker than pitch black.\n\nThe next day, I guess she was very off. And I was pestering her to tell me what was wrong until I said something like \"Was it the black man\"? Or something like that.\n\nI don't recall this experience at all. But, there are so many factors that make me think it could have actually been something.\n\nMy mom is \"witchy\" enough. She could tell when bad things are happening to family, reads regular cards like tarot cards, and has a bunch of paranormal stories - some being violent, like where she was physically held down.\n\nThe room it happened it was always kinda scary to me. I had nightmares that took place in that room until my mid-20s. My mom also had at least one paranormal experience there.\n\nMy best friend was a Christian intuitive, and said she and her mom could see demons attached to me (they never pressured me about it or anything - and that friend became an atheist who thinks that she was just seeing \"trauma\"). She also hated that room, and that entire side of the house.\n\nI went on an Ayahuasca retreat last year, and we did workshops on entity removal. During one of the ceremonies, I started thinking about this entity and felt like it was possible that it had been following me. I did the exercise to release it, and do feel better. I guess I actually feel safe enough about it to try to understand the experience more.\n\nWhat was it? Was it there for my mom or me? Was it following me moving forward? If so, how do I know if I properly released it? Was it nothing, and all my fears are likely from my mom's stories? I have so many questions.\n\nIf you got this far, thank you!",

        "text": "When I was growing up we lived on a military base that was said to be extremely haunted. \n\nMy sister would say we couldn’t go in our play room because of the dark shadow that was in there. We ended up sleeping together  every night because we always felt something was there. Fast forward, my parents got divorced and we moved off the base. My dad purchased a larger house with his new wife 3 months later and we moved in. One of my little step sisters room was upstairs while myself, my sister and the other step sister had our rooms on lower level. Something about that house has always been off. My step mom, sisters and myself have always been scared being there. The feeling of something behind you or watching you was ALWAYS there. Any time my sisters and I would go anywhere in the house, we always felt we had to run to get where we were going in fear something was going to get us from behind. In my older sisters room during the middle of the night, her metal hangers would swing back and fourth an her tv would randomly turn on. My step sister walked past the bathroom where we had a body mirror hanging on the door and she saw a male figure looking in the mirror. My sisters and I were watching a movie downstairs when we heard what sounded  like scratching. We turned it the tv and listened and it was coming downstairs storage closet. We tried hiding in there a few times playing tag but we would always get to scared and go out and find somewhere else to go. When we opened the door to see what was scratching, there was nothing there. Just the blankets and lawn chairs placed inside but there were scratch marks on the door. We went up and told my dad who never believes any story we told and said we were all just dramatic. As time went on, my older sister stopped coming to my dads and I continued as I loved spending time with my little sisters. They both would crawl in bed with me at night as we were lol terrified to sleep alone. One night all three of up woke up because we let tapping on the end of the bed. We all sat up and pulled our legs to our chest. We yelled out to my dad who didn’t respond to stop trying to scare us. My door was closed and it was just us in the room. We’ve seen shadows on walls, my step mom said she heard and felt someone whisper (mumbles) from behind her while she did homework in the kitchen and my mom swore something touched her one night when we were caring for our pet skunk while my dad and stepmom were out of town. When I was 16 my dad decided to move back to his home state and from there I never had issues again. Fast forward my sister has had issues in almost all the homes she has been in since she married my brother in law. In 2011 they were renting a home 3 hours from our home town. They constantly heard knocking and scratching sounds, swore there was footprints from boots in the carpet in a room they didn’t use that were bigger than anyone’s in the home, my nephew who was around 1.5 at the time was so scared of his room he wouldn’t go near it and when my sister was sick she swore she saw a black figure with long fingers and nails on the ceiling down the hall that came running across the ceiling towards her and disappeared when my brother in law came into the room. He got out of the military and they moved back home. They purchased a home and moved in. Shortly after there were issues there too. The basement was always so cold, you would feel uneasy and no one would go down unless there was more than one person to go down to do laundry. Her son who was now about 3 who was speaking and doing fine again, would not use his room. He was speaking clearly with no issues. My sister had put him in his room for a week straight to see if he could make it through the night. Each night he would coming in the room screaming and crying that he was scared of the man. On the last night he screamed for help, my sister and brother in law lean up and look into his room and said they saw a shadow that moved. My brother in law ran to get him and bring him to the room and he said that there was a man telling him not to make a noise and was going to get him trying to crawl on the bed. From there he slept in their room. They all felt uneasy and looked for a new home in another town. Once they moved there they heard tapping noises or their bedroom light would turn on and off. My sister then spoke with a medium via Skype to do a reading. Per the medium my sister has two things with her. One a man who is a “nice spirit” who she said was her husband in a past life. She said he has shoulder length hair and wears civil war era uniform. She said he does the tapping notices and watches over her. She then said there was something much darker in the home who every once in awhile try’s to make himself known that he is in the home. \n\nI have always wondered through all these years if the uneasy, scary things we experienced were the dark thing in the house and if it has followed her our whole lives. And if that is the case, how does or did it chose who it was going to attach too between her and myself since? \n\nI have always said and will continue to say I’m happy that it’s with her and not with me and my family. To this day I still will not ever watch a scary movie with anything paranormal in fear I  would be welcoming something into my home or life.",

In the dream I 'woke up' and I was on the sofa at my nans old house. My nan died when I was 13 by the way. I woke up and she was sat next to me having her cup of tea on the pull out wooden tray that she always had.

We talked about a few more things, suddenly she told me that I needed to go and she will always watch over me.\n\nI woke up abruptly in bed and honestly.... I started crying. I cried and sobbed because I so badly wanted to be with my Nan. I sobbed because I let her down and I felt like even more of a failure that my plans were fooled. Somehow she knew.\n\nI obviously didn't kill myself then. I womened up (haha) and now I'm married and have the most gorgeous baby ever.\n\nI believe Nanny Lilly was there for me in my darkest hour and I'm glad I didn't go through with it.",

        "text": "In '96, I was already married 4 years, had a baby boy, and wife an I had just lost our little baby girl.  We had stuck it out, together, which is unusual, normally married people lose their love SO after a tragic death of their baby, but my wife decided to stay with me.\n\nI broke my back that year two months later while working in the convenience stores.  I was the new manager of a little store in Texas, and the cooler looked horrid, so me and one of the workers rearranged it and 3 days later, I could not stand up.  It was a bilateral hernia in the l4-l5 region.  Laminectomy/Discectomy was done in January of the next year.\n\nThe surgery failed within 30 days, Doctor said there was a good probability it would not take, but insurance would not do anything different, they didn't care.  In July I was back in for my second surgery in a year to get titanium screws into my back.  Doctor told me it was the same gig, just common in, may be a little more painful, but it would definitely work.\n\nWhen I went in, I knew I was gonna die, but I could not live with the pain.  So I went under.  Now anyone who has ever had a surgery knows, you may dream coming out of anesthesia but not while under.  Well, I did have a vision of sorts.  \n\nWhile on my stomach, over the end of the table, I could see where my doctor was, where I was and where one other person was, as well as one piece of other equipment.  I was seeing it from the back left of the room, and I discussed all this with the doctor afterwards.  I told him there was a stool at the end of the table, and there was this kind of crank in my back, I was partially over the end of the table with the tool in my back, you were sitting on the stool wiping your brow with something white.  At the head of the table there was a bag, with a line to my arm, of course, and a person up there and beside him was the heart monitor machine, and it had a green line on it.  The man at the top of the table put something in the line that was in my arm, and the machine's line jumped, and it was over, I was waking up from my surgery.  I started to cry, because I knew how close I had come, they sent my wife in to calm me, and a couple of minutes later I was okay, but have always remembered this like I just woke up.  Dreams fade this has never faded, but I wonder why I did not go down the hole, and I will explain that in a different post, I am glad I have been able to see that boy grow up and we have had three other sons since, but that vision is still as bright as the day I woke up after the surgery.\n\nI questioned this dream, like I question EVERYTHING, so I talked to my Doctor, especially after my wife said that the doctor came out and told her it got shaky for a couple of minutes when the 4 hour surgery took 6 hours.  I told him what I saw, what I remembered, and he told me that was the kind of thing that makes him believe there was life after death.  You see, when I told him this, was when you were asleep before they took you back, and was awakened after they took you out, there should be no way for me to know how the room was set up, but it was exactly what I said, and further, he had sat down and told the anastasis to inject something and it worked like a charm, and as for the tool it was a  crank, for when you do a kind of tap and die for the back.  I went to see pictures, but there are not any I could find now, but he showed it to me while I was in the office.\n\nI know there will be many who say this is BS, and I am okay with that, but I wonder, why not the tunnel, why did I just hang out in the top left corner of the room?  Was I afraid for my wife?  Did I really not want to go yet? Did I have too many commitments?  Or, if they had not done the right thing, would I have gone down the tunnel anyway?  I do not know the answers to these questions, I just know what I saw.  Peace and love to all.",

        "text": "Ok so this is extremely weird and I have no idea what to think. I recently moved to a new province and am really enjoying life out here. New friends, new job, and now a new ghost it seems. \n\nI have had many paranormal experiences including something that followed me from home to home. Since moving, I have not had any negative experiences or even felt uncomfortable. I recently moved into an old-ish house in one of the main cities here. It’s a little rental right on the water. It has a great overall vibe and I work from home quite a bit so I am very comfortable here. \n\nThese experiences are mainly just…. Odd. And kinda cute if I am being honest. \n\nI have a little cat who I brought with me, and my first real experiences in this house includes her. When we first moved she was instantly attracted to a specific window sill at the front of the house where she now spends most of her time. She would always act like something was playing with her (which isn’t unusual for cats lol) or petting her. I’d always hear her purring and see her rubbing herself all over the window randomly throughout the day. \n\nThen, I would start to wake up in the night to hear her playing with something in the living room right next to the window. I often found little trinkets or pieces of trash that I had never seen before scattered in the living room after being asleep all night. This is, again, not that unusual for a cat. They tend to find really odd things to play with so I brushed it off. \n\nThen one night, I had a friend stay over and she swore up and down that my cat had been playing with a ribbon that was hovering mid air in front of her. I figured it had gotten stuck on something and that the cat had just started playing with it since I never did find the ribbon. Until the next few experiences happened. \n\nI recently started bingeing tv shows and one of those shows was Downton Abbey. If you don’t know what it is, it’s a period piece drama set in the 1910’s. Every time I would turn on the show I would hear quick little steps running into the living room from the front window. I thought it was my cat and didn’t think anything about not seeing her since she is black and blends in with the dark flooring. \n\nWhen I would turn off the tv, I would sometimes hear a click and the tv would go right back to Downton. It would always play season 1 episode 3 and I could never find a technical reason for both the tv, the Xbox, and Netflix all being turned on at the same time. Especially to the same episode. I do have a chromecast as well, but generally you have to go to the app and click a few buttons to cast. Also, the source would need to be changed on the tv. \n\nThis happens nearly every time I turn off the show. It’s a bit annoying but now I just leave the show on while I do other things. The only other thing that has happened is sometimes I hear soft banging or tapping from the closet beside the front window when my cat isn’t there. Almost like it is calling my cat over (a ghost pspspsps if you will).\n\nMy cat is loving it here and we are super happy. This is such a great house and it seems like whatever is here enjoys having us. It doesn’t seem like some of these experiences are exactly “paranormal”, but when all of them are happening at the same time, it makes me pause. Not too sure what to think yet, but it seems harmless enough right?",

        "text": "I’ve had my fair share of paranormal experiences as a kid. Some truly intense that I’ll never forget. \n\nDescribing the Scene:\nWhen I was a kid, I lived in an apartment in chicago. This apartment had two beds and one bath. Both bedrooms were adjacent to the kitchen. My mom obviously slept in the larger room as me and my two brothers slept in the other one using a bunk bed. I always found it to be strange but my mom always wanted us to have our door open yet she would ALWAYS closed her door. Nethertheless, one night before we all went to bed we witness my mom close the door to her room and say goodnight to us. That specific night something terrifying occurred.\n\nThe event:\nI remember around the 3am hour my oldest brother woke me up frantically. I was extremely confused and trying to understand why he woke me up. He finally told me to shut up and to just listen. So I listened. Out of nowhere my moms door slowly started to creek open…… in my mind I thought maybe it’s my mom getting ready to yell at us cause we’re awake but instead things got worst. The door eventually was fully open and you could hear my mom in the other room just moving around a lot in her bed. It was so strange cause she was groaning. At this point my heart was racing cause I know something bad was happening. My mom was beginning to talk as she was groaning and my brother and I heard her saying “no” and “stop”. All the noise eventually stopped completely and we thought it was the end of it. Out of nowhere my mom started to scream at the top of her lungs “get off of me, leave me alone, get off!”. Instinctively my brother and I got up from the bed and ran to my moms room. We saw the door fully open and my mom was sitting up scared on her bed. We turned the light on and she got mad at us and told us what are we doing, go to bed. We asked her if she was okay and told her what we heard. She started laughing saying she was fine and to go back to bed. So we did.\n\nThe next morning:\nWhen my brothers and I woke up, my older brother told the middle one why didn’t he wake up when he was trying to wake him up. My middle brother swears to this day that he felt something hit him in his face prior to my older brother waking up and he got paralyzed afterwards. He recalls the entire night of what happen and the crazy thing is, he described the night to us before we told him what happen.\n\nThe shock:\nLater in my adult years my mother randomly told us how she use to play the Oujia board when she was younger. It all makes sense why that night happen and why we’ve all experience a ton of paranormal things even when we moved from place to place. She definitely welcomed something evil. Hopefully these evil experiences don’t carry down to my children. I sadly still experience things and I just bought a house with my spouse.",

        "text": "Hello guys, first I'm not fluent in English so I'll try my best to explain the story to you .. ! \n\nSo it started this August when I was in Algeria for the holidays. Actually, I had my birthday there so that mean I am 17 yrs old and it happened 2 days before my birthday. \n\nIt started at 4-5 AM (I'm not sure exactly), and I woke up because I was thirsty and because I had to pray (by the way my family and I are religious). \n\nSo I went to the kitchen to drink a cup of water and I saw a hijab on the floor, that was a bit scary because my grandma or anyone in the family won't let something lying on the floor, but yeah I don't really care about it because I thought it was my little cousins who were playing last night with this hijab but anyway.\n\nAfter that I went to the bathroom so I can do my ablutions and I closed the door behind me because I was too scared lol and it was dark.\n\nTo put you in context, when we enter to the bathroom, in front of us there is directly the sink with a large mirror, and we can see in the mirror what is behind us, so for exemple the door (the door had a little window but it was a blurry window so we can't really see through it).\n\nWhen I was done with my ablutions, I took a look over the mirror because something took my attention, but I don't know what, It was a strange sensation for me, It was like being observed by someone and I was uncomfortable. \n\nBasically the \"Adhan\" (the Adhan is the call to prayer that reasones throughout the house) had to ring but it didn't and I didn't really paid attention to it because I always put an alarm on my phone 15 min before the prayer time so I thought it wasn't yet the time to pray, but actually it was because I checked my phone. \n\nSo it was a bit weird and I thought the Adhan alarm in the house was broke so yeah I was just trying to think of real situation that can actually happen and not believe it was paranormal, until I heard someone reciting the Quran.. but it wasn't actually words from the Quran, because it didn't really sounds like Arabic words, but something else and I could not say what it was. So I went outside the bathroom to see who was it ( I really thought it was my mom or my aunt because it was a woman voice).\n\nWhen I leave the bathroom, on the right, there is a long corridor that leads to the room where I normally pray, but when I turned my head, I saw a person, wearing a black-gray niqab (it was dark so the color was between gray and black) and going INSIDE THE ROOM I NORMALLY GO TO PRAY ! AND THIS PERSON WAS ACTUALLY LOOKING AT ME WHILE GOING INSIDE THE ROOM AND SHE WAS RECITING THOSE WORDS\n\nAnd stupid I was, I thought again it was my aunt or mom, because as I said, I was trying to find a reason. \n\nBut this time, I don't know why, I went to the living room (everyone sleep there because it's big and there's also a air conditioner) and when I opened the door, guess who was sleeping there ? Everyone. \n\nMom, cousins, aunties, grandma.... bro ? So who was it ? \n\nI was freaking scared, not gonna lie, and at this moment, I knew it wasn't human or something good.\n\nMy prayer mat was in the room where the person went in, but I was too scared to go because it was dark, so I took my grandma's prayer mat (Thanks God it was lying next to her) and I started to pray in the living room (Basically I don't pray there because people were sleeping and all but anyway).\n\nWhen I was done with the prayer, I went next to my mom and tried to sleep, but I couldn't because of what happened. \n\nAt least I managed to sleep, and in the morning, I went to the room where I basically pray because I was curious and cannot stop asking myself what happened, and I saw the hijab who was lying in the kitchen, lying on the floor. \n\nI was the only one who woke up early in the morning, so I don't know what happened, who put the hijab in this room, who was this person and what was she reciting. \n\nWhen my family woke up, I asked them if they woke up to pray but no one said yes, they said that they were sleeping because they didn't heard the Adhan alarm so that's why they couldn't wake up to pray. \n\nA lot of paranormal things happened after this one, I don't know if you want to know them, but for me, this one was the most terrifying, especially when you are religious. \n\nFew days later I became seriously ill and almost didn't go back to Switzerland.\n\nWhen I told this story to my family, no one believed me, especially my grandma who took it seriously and purified the house with an Imam. \n\nThat was my story, 2 days before my birthday, so the 4th August 2022.",

        "text": "This story isn’t very frightening, at least not to me, but fear works differently depending on the person in question.\n\nIt all starts when I was a toddler. For context, I was almost blind until about the age of 5, the world was smudges and brief sparks of colour. People were skin coloured figures. Sometimes my vision would go out completely and I would have to be in the void for longer than I could stand. Sometimes, though, people would show up as blackish or gray figures with whiteish eyes glowing bright like LEDs. \n\nAfter my vison cleared up, they stayed. I would see them at night around my bed, looking at me, feel their presence around me in empty rooms, see their silhouettes in thunderstorms. \n\nThey would come before horrible things in my life. Before the bullying started. Before a crazy dentist drilled into my gums, before I was molested, before fights in school, before my mother’s breakdowns that lasted hours. And after that, they would follow me around. Stay for a while, even after the event was done. I started getting used to them. I didn’t care at all, I was desensitised to their presence. A few weeks ago, after almost two years without them, I saw them once agin. They tailed me in the empty hallways of my school (used to be a mental hospital during ww2 so it’s full of corridors and angles) and walked/floated(idk) near me. I brushed them off, walked faster. I figured it was because I was tired. A bit closer to now, I was getting a coffee in the city and they followed me. They’re shorter now, or maybe I’m taller. I’m still quite short though.\n\nYesterday my parents sat me down and told me they were divorcing. Not legally, but Mother and I are moving out and Father gets the house and cat. I’ve been waiting for this for a while, ever since they got married stony-faced and Mother told me ugly secrets. \n\nThey’re still there, I think. Anyway, I hope so.\n\nIf you can read this, thank you. You were the only things there. \n\nI call you Darklings because I don’t know your names, sorry..\n\nI made some watercolours of some memories of them, I’ll link them below.",

My biggest fear is being marked with the signature 3 marks on my back that have burned for 24 hrs plus, I've ruled out anything that could have caused it and I have no pets that could have done it as well as its in a spot that cannot be through self infliction and there was nothing on the bed that could have scraped and made the marks. I know of two people who may be causing this because they are very spiteful and have practiced black magic and the dark arts with demons and ouija boards. I tried to get advice through ask Reddit but everyone who commented had the most idiotic things to say and took everything as a joke. I know what is on my body and I've done plenty of paranormal research I just dont know how to go about protecting myself and my children from someone or something that is trying to destroy the family I am building.",

        "text": "1994, I was 24 years old at the ER with a hand infection. The Doc discovered I had a piece of glass lodged in my pinky finger, and it had become infected. He removed the glass and irrigated the wound and sent me home with anti-biotic saying ‘if it gets any worse just come back in’.\n\nI drove the 30 minutes home and began feeling immense pain within minutes of being home. I immediately returned to the hospital; but by the time I arrived the pain was completely unbearable.\n\nThe infection felt like someone drilled a 3/4” hole in the palm of my hand with a spade bit, poured gasoline in it, and lit it on fire. \n\nMy veins in my right arm were purple all the way to my shoulder as the infection travelled.\n\nI collapsed on the floor of the ER lobby and next thing I know they are cutting a ring off a swollen finger and prepping me for immediate surgery. The Surgeon said ‘are you willing to lose your hand to save your life?’ I responded ‘do whatever you need to do’.\n\nI woke up post surgery in ICU with a severe strep infection. I still had my hand but they had to open my pinky, palm, and wrist to ‘scrape’ the infection from my nerves and tendons. \n\nI stayed in ICU for two weeks and my blood counts were still not improving at all.\n\nOne night, I was sleeping and had a dream, or a vision if you will…\n\nI was awakened by a black shadow at the foot of my bed. He had lifted and dropped the end of my bed, startling me awake, and then disappeared. \n\nTerrified, I rang the nurse’s bell several times to no avail; so I got out of bed to find my way to the nurse’s station.\n\nThe hospital was different. The lights were off in my room and the door was open. The hallway was dimly lit. I walked down the hall and it was nasty. The walls were urine colored and filth was dripping and oozing down the walls.\n\nThere were a few people about; but they were dead, shuffling about in their hospital gowns, pulling their i.v. stands slowly along the dimly lit corridor.\n\nI ran back to my room and jumped into bed. \n\nThe black shadow returned and now I realized he was either Death or a demon. He did not have detailed facial or body features; just a black humanoid body surrounded by an aura of darkness.\n\nWithout uttering a word or making a sound, he violently and repeatedly lifted the end of the heavy hospital bed high and slammed it down, shaking it side to side each time, over and over again. \n\nFinally, I said loudly and with force ‘In the name of Jesus Christ I command you to GO!’\n\nThe room became momentarily black and then BAM! A bright, white electricity shattered the void and enveloped the demon. Crackling in electric vehemence. The being reacted as if being violently electrocuted and fried by 20,000 volts of pure electricity. And suddenly it was gone and I awoke.\n\nThe bright lights, sanitized room, and beeping monitors were a welcome site.\n\nI rang the nurse’s bell and yelled for help. They came immediately and checked everything out, and took a blood draw for the lab.\n\nThe next morning the Physician and Medical Team came in and told me that my bloodwork came back great with a normal white cell count. This after 14 days of no improvement until now.\n\nI was released the next day and went though vigorous physical therapy to regain 100% use of my hand. \n\nIt took 28 years to write down this experience. So I share it here for the first time with you.",

This not only made me skeptical of if the channel is genuine or not but brought me to, what if the spirit needs the energy to show a sign. You see movies where they will throw stuff, but that would take so much energy to be able to do so how would the explorer share or give energy to the spirit to allow them to show a sign and give us an answer? I feel the ouija board works because you actively put your energy into it for them to use. So how would you allow the spirit to gain energy to give a sign/response?",

        "text": "So, every time I used to stay up till 3am (when I was 11-12 yrs old), I would hear things in my kitchen. It was usually right before I fell asleep. I remember laying in my bed, rock still, shivering and sweating because I hear clear as day footsteps coming down the hallway. They would seem as if they were coming closer and closer, and just as they sounded like they would come in my room, they would stop, then 2 minutes later the same thing kept happening but I never heard them going back down the hallway. Sometimes I would also hear breathing next to my bed and had senses of something hovering over me. I also had a time when I was a lot younger (7-9) when I was SO scared of sleeping alone in my room so I would go into the lounge to sleep with my mum, but I was also really scared of the lounge room because I always would think something was behind the couch. One night I woke up at around 2 in the morning to me sweating and at this point I was panicking so much my mum woke up. At the time I was constantly living in fear, I could NOT go down the hallway by myself, I could NOT go in my room by myself same with my parents bedroom, the lounge room, on my front deck, and even when I was showering I was freaked out because I always felt something was watching me. (Literally my iPad was typing slow which it never does and I just said ‘go away’ in an annoyed tone and it stopped😭🤚🏻) to this day am still kinda scared but I have grown used to it. Something I think it’s my dog who passed away because all of the things that happened came after that. For the passed year I have kind of made up my own little god thingo called azrah which I kinda pray to sometimes when I’m in a tough situation and for some reason everything that happens kind of falls into place with her, (probably going crazy at this point but yk)",

The Whole time she's super touchy and flirty and asks if I want to stay where we where or go back to my place. So naturally we go back to my place with is a house I'm house sitting for(they told me I could have ppl over)\n\nI'm bring here in the house and the three dogs I'm watching instantly turn hostile/aggressive. They jumping at the baby gate that keeps them out of the rest of the house while I'm gone. Crying,whinning,growling I introduce them to the girl and the whole tike their getting more and more reved up growling more and more. Suddenly two of them start fighting jumping on eachother, it wasn't a play fight it was a fight that if I didint step in someone was going to get hurt.i tried to grab them and they shoot across the house away from me, these dogs r so peaceful they would never do that.\n\nI bring them out they go to the bathroom and I come back, and while one dogs ok the others can't stop looking at the girl and getting more and more upset, growling and fighting eachother. She leaves and I calm the dogs down their loving on me again, licking my face and rolling over for belly rubs. She comes in again they install start growling and fighting their all female dogs and I've never seen them do this. I'm starting to get scared as one of them we'll call b, looks into my eyes looks at the girl growls and looks back in my eyes. B tells me where she leaves her tennis balls by looking at the ball then me so I can trace her vision. She was definitely trying to tell me something about the girl in our \"language\"\n\nThe girl goes in my room and shuts the door again I get both dogs and hug them tight, I'm kinda crying I love these guys and they never had been like this before.  I lead one upstairs where it likes to stay, and the other one goes shooting into my room where the girl is, I try to calm her down but again she keeps looking from the girl to me then at the girl then back to me, whinning and crying the whole time. Eventually the dog shoots by the end of my bed shoves her head under and flounders rhe rest of her body holding her Tail still. The whole time over rhe course of this encounter did this 15 times, at one point the girl touched her back and this dog whined and shuffed forward three times away from the girls hand. \n\nShe did this so many times just looking at the girl then shoving her head under, then would rub up on the girl and whine then shoot under the bed. Eventually the girl left because I asked her to, and as soon as she left the dog stopped. Her heart was racing, fear was in her eyes and she was hyper ventilating. But as soon as the girl crossed the threshold of the house she stopped and laid on the couch with me as I pet her.\n\nNo more then two minutes later the light and love is back in her she's letting me pet her stomach. Then she runs twords the door and turns around looking to my right then back at me then to my right again. She was showing me the tennis ball she left for me and then when I figured out she was pointing to the girl telling me something that something was wrong.\n\nAfter we played catch she laid down and fell fast asleep, I had another friend over a boy in town and the dogs loved him and played with him the whole time. And Their used to girls the owners have two daughters so this was just...wierd\n\nI feel like they where trying to tell me something was up with the girl, and I listened and had her leave. I'm super freaked the fuck out and nervous, the vibes where totally off and I could feel such wierd energy around it.\n\nThanks For Reading",

        "text": "OK this happened to me a few years ago, and I have always wondered how the hell it happened. Since it was something so physical it is hard to wrap my mind around it. \n\nI was in college, home for the summer and about to go back to school. My boyfriend of about two years had gotten me a ring the previous year in November for our anniversary, so I had it for almost a year. I had specifically picked out the ring from Pandora, and it was a limited time piece, I had never seen it before I had asked him for it. It was a simple red heart and the band was scalloped if that makes sense. It was nothing crazy, and I wore it basically every day. I kept track of it very well (this is important). \n\nWhile I was packing to get back to school, I had packed up all my jewelry and had accidentally packed away my daily jewelry that day. I figured no biggie because I’ll be moving things in the next day, getting sweaty and what not so I didn’t want to lose anything/ruin anything anyways, and I’d unpack it the next day. Two of my friends had driven from different states the day before so that we could move into our college house together, and came to stay the night at my dads since I was in the same state as our college. We hung out in my room, watched tv, then went to bed because the next day was going to be long. \n\nI woke up the next morning, and immediately noticed a ring to the right of my bed, on the ledge of my wall. The ledge was only about an inch and a half thick - you couldn’t fit much on it. I picked it up, and it was the EXACT same ring my boyfriend had bought me, but the heart in the middle was clear instead of red. I thought it was so weird. I picked up the ring and brought it into the room with my two friends, and asked if either of them left their ring in my room last night, and that it was so funny we had the same one (although I had been friends with them for years and would’ve noticed by then if we had the same one). They both said it wasn’t theirs. I laughed and told them to stop messing with me, and they looked really confused. They both said they had never seen the ring before and never owned one like it. I really thought they were trying to screw with me, but they genuinely denied it and were just as confused as I was.\n\nThen I texted my boyfriend, asking if maybe he had bought two different ones to test out the colors, and forgot about it and it somehow ended up in my room (even though I had never noticed it on the ledge before). He said he definitely only bought one, and it was the red one. I reached out to my dads girlfriend, who was the only other woman that stayed in that house, if she owned the ring, and she said she had never seen it before. I was trying to check any logical explanation there was. \n\nI know what you’re probably thinking - that I didn’t actually pack the ring from my boyfriend, and it was up there all along. I ran to my packed bag and pulled out the ring my boyfriend gave me. Still as red as I remember. I was holding the two identical rings in my hand, with no explanation as to how the second one came about. I went to Pandoras website to look at the ring, and it wasn’t even sold anymore. I couldn’t find it anywhere. \n\nI still have no idea where it came from or why. The creepiest piece is that my dads house was built in the 1700s - it was the original farm house of the town he lives in. Definitely not short on paranormal possibilities. \n\nTo this day I’m dying to know how it happened.",

        "text": "A bit long, but I know you all like a good account. \n\nAs a student in the late-90s, I was asked to take part in the last UK universities pistol shooting competition at Bisley Camp, home of Britain’s largest competitive shooting complex. I wasn’t keen on it as the Dunblane Massacre had put a grim slant on things and pistols were about to be permanently banned. \n\nWith peer pressure I agreed to go along. A minibus would take the team up, we’d have the competition, come home, go to the pub for a laugh. \n\nThe night before the competition I had a crystal clear dream of a white Ford Capri and a horrible accident. A row of four orange-leafed trees. A broken axle. A Scottish woman with a small black dog asking if I was alright. I woke up that morning to be told our minibus booking had fallen through and some guy called Luke would drive the four of us. \n\nI didn’t know the guy, had never met him, never heard of him, knew nothing about him or his car and had never been to Bisley. Luke was just a friend of a team member doing us a favour. Yet he was wearing the red jacket, black jeans, and blue baseball cap of the person I’d seen in my dream. \n\nWhen he turned up at our halls of residence in a white two-door Ford Capri both I and the friend I’d told about the dream essentially went pale and refused to get in the car. \n\n“Guys you’re being ridiculous; I had it serviced last month. It’s old but it’s fine”. \n\n“Nah man- the front axle of that car is….”\n\n“What?! The axle is fine!” \n\nPissed off because we were late, he gets in and throws the car up and down the driveway jamming on the brakes then shouts “See? Get in- we’re late”. \n\nThe day goes fine, competition ends, all in high spirits. Get in the car and idiot Luke decides to speed up the main road out of the camp. Just as I yell “STOP THE FUCKING CAR, I’M GETTING OUT!” there’s an almighty pop followed by screeching as the car veers left into a row of four orange-leafed trees and comes to a halt. \n\nLots of panicked shouting and cursing. We get out and, yep, the axle has snapped. A crowd gathers due to the noise. As I’m standing there freaked out by it all a small woman I somehow recognise walks up and, yep, asks me if I’m alright. She has a Scottish accent and is walking a small black terrier. \n\nWhen the AA man turns up he tells us that if this had happened at speed on the motorway there’s a good chance we’d all be dead. \n\nWe eventually got home via some ridiculous series of buses and I sat eating in silence in the dining hall with my friend, both of us too fucked up to say anything. I’d described the whole thing to him that morning and for several weeks afterward he became quite distant…as though he mentally connected me with death itself. \n\nAbout a decade later we caught up and the event came up in conversation. He found it much harder to talk about, but his comment has always struck me. He said that what I told him, and what occurred that morning, had forced him to see life in very different terms. Essentially he’d had to face up to the possibility that there was more to this life than he was willing to consider, and that it frightened him. He’d even had a few nightmares about it over the ensuing years. As he said, “The sheer size of what it all, and what it meant, has always scared me since then”. \n\nI’m in my forties now and I find myself thinking about it every so often. I still (well over 20 years later) find it very hard to describe what I truly feel. I just know that this life and this death are far larger than we can ever comprehend. \n\nTo finish it all, a couple of years ago I had to sit in the back seat of my brother’s two-door car on a quick journey. For the first time in my life I had what I now know is a panic attack, and clearly linked to what I’ve just described. It was horrific, and I will never sit in one of those ever again. This stuff is buried very deep in our consciousness.",

        "text": "When I was about 9 years old, I was sleeping in my room in the top bunk of a bunk bed, and, for seemingly no reason, I find myself waking up in the middle of the night. Usually I would just wait to fall back asleep, but I had the urge to open my eyes. Being on the top bunk meant I had a really good landscape view of my room; window on the far right, bedroom door on the far left. \n\nAbout two feet away from me and a bit lower down (because I was high up), I see a black and white, semi transparent man, standing still, facing my bedroom door (thank God he wasn't facing me, I think I would have died from shock).\n\nHe was an old man, very distinguished, and I remember most distinctly his formal attire. He was wearing a very fancy dinner suit, an old fashioned black tail coat, white shirt and that white frilly thing under the collar. He was also floating, as only from his hips upwards was visible (my view was not impeded).\n\nHe started to move slowly towards my bedroom door. I couldn't believe what I was seeing was real, and I thought this must be my eyes being funny from waking up mere seconds ago. I rubbed my eyes quickly, blinked rapidly, and still, the top half of this old man dressed in a nice old fashioned dinner suit floating out of my room was just as clear. \n\nHe drifted out my room silently and I was left frozen with fear. I contemplated calling out to my parents, but couldn't muster the courage. I was afraid of causing something bad to happen, I had visions of the ghost whooshing back into my room as soon as I call out for help, this time angry and focused on me.\n\nI did what any young child would do in that situation. I silently and slowly twisted around to face the other way whilst simultaneously bringing the quilt over my head. I remember staying under the covers and roasting, sweltering, and telling myself I cannot risk making a sound or exposing myself from underneath my quilt. I remember thinking that I just need to get to the morning, I knew it would be a long night and it was. \n\nNeedless to say, my mind could have been playing tricks on me that night. Even after that experience and a few others in the same house, I still don't really believe in the spooky haunted house type of ghost, so I can't say exactly what happened. \n\nBut I did learn that the original owner of this house was a captain of a ship (probably around 1940's/50's) and he died whilst still a resident in this house.",

        "text": "About two years ago, I flew to Peru with a group of travelers; there were about ten people from the group with me when the following event took place. We had arrived at our destination about an hour earlier by PeruRail, it was evening, and the group was getting hungry. We ventured down the street from our hotel in search of a restaurant. It was about 8 PM and the sun had fully set.\n\nThis area was particularly curated for tourists, so plenty of gift shops and convenience stores were still open. We found a bar-and-grill that looked interesting; the side facing the street was mostly glass windows that let guests view across the town and into the mountains. It might have been only two stories, but the building gave the impression of being three or four stories. Small lanterns and neon lights dimly lit the restaurant, which only added to its intrigue. Someone in the group may have heard a recommendation for this restaurant and we decided to go inside.\n\nWe climbed a narrow and steep staircase that wound around and led up into the dining area. However, as soon as I stepped foot inside the restaurant, I felt a powerful surge of dread build up inside of me. I climbed the crowded stairs, and my body screamed at me to get out. The fear was like a fine icicle in my spine that spread to my extremities.\n\nAt first, I felt confusion because nothing seemed to be wrong. The people in my group were laughing amongst themselves; the waiters were friendly and offering us seats. The normal chatter and clinking of dishes filled the air and everyone was having a good time. I saw no danger. I continued to smile and was about to sit down with the group. I was going to ignore the screaming sensation because I could not see anything wrong. I also didn't want to leave because we had just arrived. It would mean walking outside into the night by myself. I was too shy to ask anyone to leave with me. Afterall, everyone was looking forward to dinner and I had been fine moments before.\n\nHowever, I decided I would take the chance and leave; I ultimately could not ignore the alarms going off inside of me. The walk back to the hotel was not too long and it had to be better than being inside this restaurant.\n\nI told someone from the group who was near me that I did not feel good and would be leaving. To my surprise, she told me she would leave with me. I did not stop to ask why; I might have said \"okay\" and turned around to climb down the stairs as quickly as I could. Waiters smiled at us as we passed them on the cramped stairs and the din traveled all the way down to the exit. I felt more like I was escaping than leaving.\n\nOnce outside, the other girl expressed her relief at my decision to leave. I was amazed to learn that, for an unknown reason, she had felt strangely unsafe inside and wanted to return to the hotel as soon as possible. I told her I had experienced the same thing. We safely walked home together.\n\nI do not know what exactly we experienced that night. We did not see anything wrong with the naked eye. But the fear I felt was extraordinary and I have never felt such an acute awareness of danger before, especially not in a situation that seemed completely normal. There was something evil about that place, even though I have no tangible proof. All I know is that I was not the only one who felt it.",

        "text": "Yo came here to ask. I ain't familiar with ghosts or any type of paranormal shit and tbh i don't want to f#k with them. But for years ive had this unsafe feeling in my room. Specifically in my room. I remember being young, i used to avoid being in my room. We have a small apartment so i always went to our living room and just stared at my doorway ready for something to happen. Well years go by and i dont rly mind it anymore. Any odd sounds or things happenin in the house i just go and see what caused it. Sometimes i find awnser sometimes not. For example. My mom is big believer in ancient indians, she believes to the ancient methods indians used to use like dreamcatchers to get rid of nightmares. But ive always had that belief that anything what has an connection to a religion or is labeled as \"holy or sacred\" will open some portals. Ive gone too far so let me tell the real thing. Few months ago my mom wanted to suprised me with a dreamcatcher since i used to complain abt the nightmares i get, as i said nowadays i don't rly give fks if i see nightmares or not. But i remember upon putting the dreamcatcher on the wall when i left out to take the trash out my mom told me that my ligt was flickering. It kinda creeps me out since on multiple occacions something evil has happened when my mom been alone, meaning like i wasn't in the house. She's been reporting me with, stuff dropping form counters lights flickering etc, she hasn't seen mimics or \"dopples\". But seems weird to me since these flickering lights and items flying across the rooms don't happen to me. Ive never witnessed paranormal event like that. Seems like my mom is the only one seeing those. I've seen events but not the same. Few events i've encountered.   \n\nOne was where me, my dad and my mom went to a cabin for a weekend. The night came and everything went normally, during the day I didn't have any unreal experiences. But at night I remember waking up to my mother screaming. I didn't go to investigate why she was screaming because I remember shouting \"is everything okay\" but I didn't get an answer, so I thought that mom had a nightmare or she was speaking asleep so I decided to go to sleep. What made the experience strange was that in the morning, when I told what I heard at night, my father and mother said they slept all night. I found it strange because the scream was loud. How did I wake up to the scream from  downstairs, but not my father, who was sleeping next to my mother? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother situation where I spent the night with my grandparents. It's been years. I remember I must have been 11 years old. The worst \"paranormal cases\" i've experienced is at my granny house.\n\n I was sleeping in my room until I heard footsteps outside the room. I decided not to pay attention to the incident because my grandparents go to the bathroom every night, the elderly have their needs. The steps started to get weird when they got closer to the my room (room where i slept). I remember waiting for one of my parents to walk into the room, but the steps stopped at the door. There was a moment of silence until I heard footsteps again and this time it sounded like the footsteps were in the living room. What made this strange was that the footsteps sounded like walking in a circle in the living room. anyway, as a young boy I didn't bother to go and see, so I listened in my room under the blanket when the footsteps started and stopped. Until finally they ended in the living room and what made this strange was that if the steps had come from either of the grandparents, I would have heard him walking into his bedroom.  \n \n\nSecond one is just creepy, i believe i was like 6 or 7 y/o on this one. I was casually going to sleep with my grandparents, i used to sleep between them since they had a big bed back then. Remember the pre-night going alright, family was ready to go to sleep. I remember passing out and waking up at night, i believe it was 2 am, remember waking up and turning myself in bed to see my grandma staring me with an evil grin, it was weird since i believe she was asleep. Grandad was in deep sleep. but grandma was just, never seen that smile on her face. After that i remember turning back to face to my grandad, was too scared to wake anybody up so i decided to go under the blanket and catch some sleep. next morning everything was normal. I didn't want to tell them abt the experience since they would think I was crazy.  \n\n\nMy conclusion after the years of experiences is that someone in our family is attracting unwanted spirits or something is following me or somebody else. Im not joking when i made this post, my grammar/vocabulary is bad so these stories might seem unrealistic or fake. But i'm just trying to look for some awnsers. I feel like these experiences are brainwashing me since i've been getting into dark stuff. ! I'm not trying to atract or summon anything nothing next lvl shit. Just some semiu casual but still weird shit like ive had these thoughs on going into haunted buildings at night, or i used to watch a high amount of horror movies. I used to hear my parents saying that \" You are getting possessed/closer and closer to devil by watching those horror movies\" so i stopped.   \n\n\nJust trying to look advice. And trying to stay sane",

        "text": "When I was 20yo I was driving past Parker, AZ when my bf accidentally took a wrong turn. We quickly realized something was wrong, because there was no sun anywhere. Keep in mind it is about 1/2pm in the spring and no mountains anywhere. Everything was pitch black no buildings or noises just blank emptiness. Then all of a sudden there's a big white sign on the side of what I believe was a road. On the sign it said in big letters \"THEY'RE HERE! TURN AROUND NOW!\" We both looked at each other and said \"Fuck that\" and turned the fuck around. And after awhile we found the freeway again and went home. And we decided that we would just never speak to each other about it again. But tbh I have been haunted by this creepy experience my whole life and I just had to share it.",

        "text": "I woke up this morning around 4 or 5 a.m. to some movement in my bed; it felt like a cat or small dog. I was fine until I remembered I was currently alone (my partner has been out of town) and we don’t own any pets. I became very afraid and slowly turned to my side. When I did that, I felt a punch to my sternum. Not hard, but not a gentle punch either. There was nothing hard in the bed with me, so it’s not like I could’ve somehow done this to myself. When this happened, I realized it wasn’t the first time and immediately recalled 3 or 4 more instances where this has happened while my partner has been out of town. I’m not sure why I forgot about all of those times until then, but it freaked me out. I turned my body onto my other side, and when I did, I had random “visions” (for lack of a better word) of a couple that I’ve never met before (they were traveling across the world). After that, I felt like I heard a snicker, kind of like the noise Snoopy or Woodstock make on Peanuts/Charlie Brown when they’re laughing. What the hell?",

Ill tell this story the same way he told it from his perspective. Bit of backstory...my father is a truck driver who drives all across America and works long hours, he also firmly does not believe in the paranormal and isn't even religious. \n\nIt was late and I had been driving for hours, I should've pulled over and took a nap but I wanted to make it to the next truck stop which was still a few miles out. It was dark, and the road ahead was windy. I found myself barely being able to keep my eyes open. Right as I almost drifted to sleep, I saw a woman appear in the road. She had a silky white night gown, and what looked like a crown made of vines. I almost slammed on my breaks but the woman began to move. She was keeping up with the truck and instinctively, as if in a trance, I began to follow her. I was following her every move. The woman guided me through the dangerous road and as soon as I made it back onto the main road, she was gone, and I was wide awake. I don't know what that was, but I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for her.\n\n(I've since forgotten what road it was, as my father has since passed away and I cant ask him, but I remember hearing a similar story awhile back and I wonder if its the same road or just a coincidence.)",

        "text": "I saw a post on this community earlier today which reminded me of an encounter I had when I was a kid. It’s weird but I have very vivid childhood memories from like 3-5(idk if it’s the same for everyone).\n\nThis happened when I was 5 years old my dad had just passed away. I barely get sick even till this day. But I had a fever then. I remember I’d be lying down on the bed and see two little people. Now they weren’t like dwarves or gnomes. They were basically like Barbie dolls but as big as water bottles (like nestle bottles). They’d appear on my bed and basically entertain me. I don’t remember what they wore but it was a man and a lady. The lady never really spoke to me but the man did. They’d do all sort of things to entertain me such as cartwheels, dancing, backflips and so on.\n\nNow my mom wasn’t really home much she was at the hospital where my dad passed away sorting out death certificates or whatever. So I was home with some relatives I barely knew so I kept it to myself and would talk to these little people. But a time came where the little man would talk about marrying me and taking me away. I don’t remember what in details he said but he did freak me out so much that it caused me to have a manic episode I was screaming “I don’t want to marry you” over and over again. I was at home with my aunts and cousins and they had no idea what to do so they rushed me to the hospital where my mom was .\n\nAccording to my mom she tried to hold me to calm me down but I had this distant look in my eyes like I didn’t know who she was or who anyone was and then suddenly I’d recognize and then forget, on and off. I remember a nurse giving me an injection (I don’t know what it was exactly) but I was able to calm down. I still had a fever for 2 weeks after that but eventually I was able to recover and never see the little people. \n\nYears later I hear my mom talking to her friend about the things I was saying. I said things like “I don’t want a ring” “I don’t want to leave here” “don’t take me away” “I don’t want to marry you”. I don’t know if this is paranormal but my mom did have a priest who said there was a female entity living in our house but the one I encountered was a male so I’m confused. Do kids have hallucinations while having a fever?. Even if it was hallucinations I knew nothing about marriage to that extent. Do I have a mental disorder? I haven’t had hallucinations since then\n\nMy mom recently told me about a little man she encountered during her childhood I’ll narrate that another time could it be the same.",

        "text": "Well that might sound silly but I do have a problem with ghosts. They are literally scaring a shit out of me. I can feel them, they love to ring the bells, move objects. I have never seen one but I can feel them, temperature of surrounding changes, I can smell different scents and I can just feel them.\nIt all has started when someone who was important to me passed away. He always joked that when he will pass away he will never leave me alone. I have tried to contact with him, weird things were happening like objects were moving and getting lost, his song was playing in the radio when I was driving. One day I've got really annoyed as another of my possession weny missing and I've scolded the ghost by saying \" I know you are here but can you be nice please, I have enough of shit happening in my life. You could help me with some money if you have to help me\" ( I was laughing because I knew that it was impossible) few days after I have received a letter from HRMC saying that I have tax return of £1000. I was like oooo okay, few other things has happened. \nAlso it is worth to mention that I have always had this weird sense like I could feel when things will happen, not what will happen but that will something happen, like I could predict it. This gift has had my mom and my great grandmother, we can just say that something will happen.\nWhen my grandma was passing away even if she was in the coma she\" called \"me and my mother. I was at university, my mum was at her work. We both drove 80 miles to see my grandma. We arrived there simultaneously without communicating with each other. Grandma passed away holding our hands 5 minutes after we have arrived. \n\nSo now I am working in one place that seems to be possessed, it is not friendly. It scares me, not on the daily basis I can feel it time to time - gives me anxiety, I feel that I am not welcome there. I have tried salt, runes, positive shielding. \nI wouldn't be so angry if this thing would leave me alone and wander around. I need this thing to stop bothering me what can I do or use as repellent ? \n\nTo add more every day I am waking up at 3am...",

        "text": "When i was a kid in Mexico we loved to play hide and seek with all the kids in the neighborhood at night, the houses were so close together that you could jump from roof to roof and with everyone being friendly and knowing each other they wouldn't mind if we did get on the roof. We had my cousins come over for dinner and our parents were just out on the porch talking having a couple drinks. Some of the kids came over and asked if we wanted to play it was already dark out and this is when we especially liked to play so we agreed. \n\nThere was this one girl I had a thing for who also happened to join that night I knew if I could get her alone I might have a chance to kiss this girl, I knew she liked me too so it would all work out. We all gathered in the middle of the street and randomly chose who would count then all the other kids would run and hide. So as the kid started counting I looked at the girl waving at her to come follow me, holding my hand I led her to mu aunts house which was vacant at the time she was on Vacation and I knew the house was empty i didn't see any other kids go there. Front door was locked so we ran to the back and checked if it was locked too and it was but at the back of the house my aunt had a old washing machine I knew we could get on the roof from their.\n\nI helped her up first and when she got up we could hear someone coming I told her to go and hide she ran off I was able to make it on the roof not long after, and I knew for sure someone was searching the house next to my aunts was having the second story re-done. I hid in a half completed bathroom I here I thought I was alone but I felt someone grab my hand it was pitch black in there I couldn't see who it was but I heard a soft voice whisper \"it's just me don't worry\" It was most definitely her so she squeezed my hand a little more. We hid for sometime and it was great then from afar we could hear all the kids saying we give up, we had won the round I came out of the bathroom and looked down at the street where all the other kids were. That's when i saw her clear as day looking up at me, I froze if she was down there who's hand am I holding  slowly turning my head i can still feel the grip of whoever's hand I was holding with it still being dark all I managed to see was the glow of 2 red eye's looking right at me no face. \n\nI wasn't the only one to see it when i got down from the roof and I jumped down the kids were all pointing up and behind me asking me who that was, they could see the red eye's too. We stopped playing immediately and went inside one of the other kids houses, we talked about what we saw but only briefly we were all scared.",
