And how exactly did he get that to occur? \nAlso, wasn’t Esha on the ground when this happened?\nFinally, did the demon remind anyone of the virus in Children of Ruin?

People have suggested stuff that crosses over and blurs lines, etc. but it just doesn’t work.\n\nOne of my biggest issues with fantasy is it’s predictability. The characters are defined by a fixed set of values, and rarely have I seen them do and say anything that stray from those.\n\nThe other issue I have is the limitations that the fantasy genre can’t seem to escape. It seems like everything is established fantasy lore, plus something else. LOTR, but vampires or something. GOT but not Eurocentric. You get the idea.\n\nI know sci-fi does some of this to some degree, but it seems like fantasy is much more limited in these ways. Someone suggested WH40K, I may check it out. Just wanted to know what other people thought.",

When i was little ( in the ‘70s ) he had bought his first house.  He could afford it because it had been an “as is property belonging to a writer”.  It wasn’t until 2019 that i learned the late writer had been the owner of said house.\n\nMy uncle kept a few boxes of her stuff, and i have no idea if he ever tried to do anything with it.  I started asking around in January/February of 2020, but then stopped because i had other things requiring focus.\n\nIt is now 2023 and I am trying again.  The boxes contain a lot of transcripts.  Several short stores, some long, and some i think are unpublished.  There is even some publication correspondence…like rejection letters and the like.\n\nMs. Long was not particularly well known and wasn’t super successful ( from what I have read ), but she did have a following.\n\nI really have no idea what to do with this stuff.  Throwing out seems premature, so looking for suggestions.\n\nThank you in advance.  Apologies in advance if this is the wrong subreddit.",

After some trial and error in decoding, they realize that it is a computer program. One of the scientists runs, and the program turns out to be a hostile artificial intelligence that destroys all of Earth to transform it into a machine that emits the initial signal again.\n\nIt sounds like Contact by Carl Sagan but the plot is a bit different.",

        "text": "About 15 years ago, I read Icarus Descending; then, over a 6 year period, I read Aestival Tide about 3 times. Finally, a few days ago, I finished Winterlong, and read Icarus again.\n\nThe entire series felt like Elizabeth had a bunch of ideas that she really wanted to see written out, but just didn't have the pages to do so. Important characters, like Ms. Scarlet, vanish and are never again seen. The Gaping One is still Gaping along as the series ends. Margalis goes suddenly from a barely developed character, to a main character of two books. The afterward of Winterlong, where she outlines the plot for Aestival Tide, is vastly different than the actual book. \n\nThere are so many important mysteries we never answer; the \"Extra-Solar Transports, dubbed a*sters*...\", whatever happens to Giles, why the map on *Helena Aulis* can show objects as far away as a quasar but Icarus is at the edge of its range, what are they mining at the L5 mining platforms?? What's the deal with earth's second moon, who lies dead in the sky, all its towers fallen? Why did the word \"margravex\" only appear in the 2nd and 3rd books, but when it appears in Icarus, it's a flashback to Winterlong, where Wendy is thinking about when the Paphians decide who to award that title to at Winterlong? How old is Zalophus, and how did he get from Cassandra to Araboth????\n\nWinterlong was not a good book; I feel Elizabeth didn't quite know where she was going with the story. Aestival Tide is amazing, a work of art, and can be read stand-alone. Icarus Descending needs backstory, but is also an enjoyable read. What little exposition you get is earned by pushing through a thousand other small mysteries that the characters assume you already know of. The trilogy has been a formative force in my art and writing, and I will gladly read them all again. Except for Winterlong; that one will stay on my shelf.",
