Deaf people obviously learn how to read all the time, so it's not impossible, but it it more difficult, or maybe even easier (no need to compare spelling rules and exceptions with pronunciation)?\n\nWould they later find it easier to pick up the language's pronunciation of they wanted?\n\nWould it be different for someone who isn't deaf, and already has a native language (and is used to reading with a voice in their head).\n\nAlso, it's probably obvious, but I'm talking about learning a language with a different writing system than your native language, so you don't end up prescribing your own pronunciation guesses to words. For example, English speaker learning to read Hebrew or Georgian or something.\n\nI want to narrow this question down to languages with some sort of (at least mostly) phonetic spelling, so this includes alphabets, abjads, abugidas, syllabaries, etc., and excludes logographic/pictographic writing.l\n\nEdit: I don't know if I made this clear enough, I'm not talking about learning to speak a language without any reference audio. What I mean is completely ignoring the concept of pronunciation in total.",

Initially they may think it is a quirk of their language, but as it turns out it evolved independently(ish) across a wide range of European languages. For example, if thinking of only the verb “to have” the phrases “I have eaten” or “J’ai mangé” are weird. How is it that the verb “to have” came to take this place in so many languages?

I’d like to one day have a PhD and am particularly interested in anthropological linguistics, how language reflects culture, how babies learn language, the differences in human and animal communication techniques, etc. I’ve also thought about teaching and lectureships, just applied for one at Glasgow uni the other day.\n\nI’ve been doing a lot of googling online because I initially thought that linguistics degree would open up government or translation jobs, however I’m seeing very few of those and the ones that are there have extremely low pay. I’d need a tier 2 sponsorship and a job that passes the RLMT with a salary of at least £40,000 with the current UK government. \n\nThe lack of jobs and employment opportunities has actually made me consider going back and getting another undergrad degree in physics or business or something that would improve my career outlook. The 8-9 meetings that I had with advisors at unit weren’t really beneficial and they offered very little substance. I’ve even started asking for help on the student room, which everyone knows can be a slippery slope. \n\nOverall, I’m only 20 years old and have a degree which is a very rare thing and I’m fortunate and appreciative of that. In theory I could start all over and have 2-3 degrees by the age of 25.\n\nHowever, with the current job market, need for a visa, having my partner living in the uk whilst I’m in the states and anxiety about my postgraduate outlook, I’m just scared. Genuinely scared. With that being said, if you have any advice, potential employers or jobs that I should look into that would meet those criteria or help to advance my career, I would greatly appreciate it.\n\nCheers,",

While it’s impossible to predict which questions will generate disscussion all of the time, here are some examples: \n\n*Quick questions:*\n\n* Asking for an explanation of a technical term\n* Asking if there are any languages with a particular feature\n* Asking how we would transcribe something\n* Asking how a feature works in a particular language\n\n*Not-so-quick questions:*\n\n* Asking about the theoretical or methodological motivation for a particular claim\n* Asking for reading recommendations for a particular subject\n\nIf you’re not sure where your question belongs, just use your best judgment. The mods might ask you to move your question—but if so, it’s no big deal, and has nothing to do with the quality of the question.\n\nAlso, before asking a question, please be sure to check [**our FAQ**](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/wiki/faqindex) and to do a quick Google or Wikipedia search. We’re happy to answer questions, but we appreciate it when people have tried to do some basic research first. You may also be interested in our [**reading list**](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/wiki/readinglist).\n\n**Commenting rules**\n\nThe rules for commenting in this post are the same as for the rest of /r/linguistics.

This could be because you posted it soon before the new Q&amp;A thread went up, or it could be because it the answer requires specialist knowledge.  If this happens, feel free to repost your question in the new Q&amp;A thread, or to post it as a separate thread.",

Was it influence from the Aramaic language (that was common in the areas of Damascus and Baghdad, which were major Islamic cities) or other languages? or did specific important dialects have that specific change making it the standard? and finally, when did the change of standard pronunciation change?

        "text": "This is a pretty open-ended (and vaguely-worded) question, but essentially I'm wondering if a trend I've noticed in a few languages is part of a larger cross-linguistic pattern.\n\nThe trend in question is the similarity between marking and sentence structure in Korean and Turkish. Despite being unrelated, they construct sentences and clauses in remarkably similar ways. Both languages treat relative clauses and adjectives in the same manner, using participles that directly precede the antecedent of the relative clause, instead of using relative pronouns as in IE languages. They diverge in that the subject of such clauses in Turkish is functions more like the possessor of the participle (and is often marked in the genitive), whereas the subject in equivalent Korean clauses functions in exactly the same way as the subject of an independent clause; but otherwise, the structures are nearly identical. Both languages also form conditional clauses with a suffix (or in the case of Turkish, which marks person and number) on the verb of the conditional clause, and - in contrast to IE languages - the conditional clause *must* come first in the sentence for this reason.\n\nI've heard that these features are typical of SOV languages like Turkish and Korean, but I've noted that Indo-European languages with SOV word order do not follow this typological pattern. Latin, which is generally SOV, exhibits a sentence structure which is almost identical to that of English or any other IE language, with the exception of the placement of the verb itself.\n\nI wonder, therefore, if there is a fundamental distinction between Latin-like languages and Turkish- or Korean-like languages that would allow us to sort most SOV languages (or maybe not just SOV languages?) into two typological categories. Are Turkish and Korean similar in these ways because they share some underlying structure that is also observed in many other non-related languages? Is that underlying structure simply agglutination? (After all, both are essentially canonical agglutinative languages, whereas Latin is a classic fusional language.) Or is it just a coincidence, and I happened to pick two similar languages to study?",

Mandarin might have this for dialects close to the standard, but I feel as though the further away you get from that cognates will slowly disappear or even take on whole new characters. How is this usually resolved? \n\n\nSimilarly with slang, while English (seemingly) seems to invent new words, I'm unaware how a (really any) largely iconographic language like Mandarin handles the phenomenon of slang/less formal speech. Is a new reading of the character after a while generally understood? Is a lesser known character or group of characters brought back into fashion? Japanese has Kanji/Katakana/Hiragana, Korean Hangul is effectively an alphabet, Mongolian (still?) has Cyrillic... No other regional language seems to have this dynamic. \n\n\nWith regard to dramas and acting, I saw a Youtube video about some movies being terrible to watch for native Mandarin/Chinese language speakers due to dialect... How hard is it to train someone or teach someone to read a character in a different dialect they haven't been exposed to? With English (or even German to some degree) it mainly involves changing pitch, vowel stress, and minor vocabulary/grammar alterations, how is this process in Mandarin?\n\n\nEdit: Before it is mention I am fully aware Pinyin exists in various forms and contexts, however I'm not certain as to how widely used it is is conventional terms for explaining concepts across dialects.

However, I always had a huge interest in language and how it works and what it does to us and also vice versa. And during my CS career I also found out that my interests lie in research and not the \"practical\" industry. And for the last 1-2 years I was getting more and more interested in linguistics and how it affects our way of thinking, this was driven by everyday situations but I like to generalize phenomena and see if this also applies to more than a particular thing. Besides, I find it quite fascinating how language plays an important role in lots of political debates nowadays. How the use of certain words impacts discussions and debates and how people react differently and also think differently etc. And in case you are German or know the \"gender\" debate the Germans have right now, this is also something which I find very interesting and the respective studies analyzing this.\n\nThis motivation was also strengthened when I started reading *Through the language glass* which I guess lots of you know. I am not very far but a friend of mine studies in Cologne and told me about the Sapir-Whorf-Hypothesis which I did not come across yet in the book, but someone else told me that it is basically about that (thanks for the spoiler, ugh).\n\nSo I am absolutely on the side and absolutely convinced that language has a massive impact on our lifes and how we make decisions unconsciously, starting from when we are a little baby through puberty and later on. I believe that this is also one of the biggest forces which enforce stereotypical thinking, biases, and so on. Since I also did came across the badling sub, where SW is highly criticized, I also cannot tell yet if I support SW since I am still a somewhat layman when it comes to this hypothesis (it also seems to me so far that this sub is pro and their sub is anti SW?). But I do support, as I said, the thinking that language massively influences our way of thinking.\n\nI could talk for hours haha, but I just wanted to give an impression of what my interests are. **Because my problem now is, where do I go with this motivation?**\n\nProfessors from my university and also others recommended the Max Planck Institute in Nijmegen and more specifically the professor [Stephen Levinsson](http://www.mpi.nl/people/levinson-stephen/publications), who contributed lots of research on the basis of the hypothesis. However, it turns out he retired and his department is not continuing right now. Our departments for linguistics (who recommended the MPI) are also interesting, but do not seem to focus completely on the hypothesis but only \"scratch\" it, although they know stuff about it.\n\nSo, since I am in Aachen, Germany and will only have a master's in CS and not in linguistics, where could I look for and are there any institutes in Germany or for example Netherlands/Belgium, where I could pursue my interest in this area and conduct research?",

The anecdotes I've heard from native speakers seem to turn more on prestige (e.g. coastal Ecuadorian feels his accent is looked down on in Spain, American thinks British people sound smart) than mutual intelligibility. I've certainly had some difficulty adapting to different accents, but to me the gap between accents within the UK, between countries in Latin America, or within the US (looking at you, rural Mississippi) has sometimes been harder to overcome than going across the pond.\n\nAre Old World and New World varieties of Spanish and English in fact more similar to each other, phonologically or otherwise, than Old World and New World varieties of Portuguese?

Since I pronounced it \"cran\" and my friends from different parts of the state (Connecticut) pronounced it \"cray-on\", I assumed it to be a regional thing. However, upon conducting my actual survey, it was completely variable - no regional correspondence whatsoever. Furthermore, both of my parents say \"cray-on\" - I don't even know where I acquired \"cran\". I did a bit more research, making an askreddit thread last year (you can see the results [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/74hmy2/do_you_pronounce_it_crayon_or_cran_and_where/?utm_source=reddit-android)) where I came across two more pronunciations, \"cray-en\" and \"crown\", the latter of which seems localized to the Southeastern US. Still, that leaves three distinct pronunciations with no (as far as I know) clearly defined boundaries:\n\n/kræn/\n\n/krεjαn/\n\n/krεjen/\n\nand, in the southeast:\n\n/kræʊn/\n\nApologies for my tenuous grasp of IPA.\n\nWhat do you guys think about this?

        "text": "Hello all!\n\nI'm from western Montana. While my accent generally goes uncommented upon in interstate settings, inevitably something peculiar comes up, and it becomes a topic of conversation. More obviously, I show some signs of so-called Canadian vowel raising, as well as what I'd call a \"rounding out\" of what would usually be realized as /oʊ/. I suppose it's less fronted than most. None of these are particularly notable, and are well-attested, at least in form. These attributes aren't *universal* to Montana, but they do appear in various strengths depending on location, and are certainly not uncommon.\n\nA few aspects of my accent, however, I've never seen written about anywhere. Occasionally I'll see reference to something similar, but always with a few major differences. In many cases, the supposed dialectical feature mentioned seems to be the *opposite* of what I (and others around me) do, in terms of which sounds assimilate to what, or under what circumstances certain changes happen.\n\nFor example, when people from elsewhere hear me say, \"vague\" or \"plague\", they immediately pick up on the fact that I don't say /veɪg/. Instead, I pronounce the word with a monophthong. I've always been curious about this, because no one back home has ever commented on it, but it seems to be very easily noticed by others. In fact, after paying attention to those from my home-state, they pronounce that word (and similar words) just as I do, but in a way that's apparently distinct to people from more eastern areas. After digging, and finding lots of anecdotal remarks online, I finally found a [paper published by the University of Washington](https://linguistics.washington.edu/research/publications/bag-beg-bagel-prevelar-raising-and-merger-pacific-northwest-english) that stated that some speakers in the Pacific Northwest (the scope of the study did not include my home state) were said to exhibit a merger of /eg/ and /eɪg/ with /ɛg/, in which /e/ lowered, /ɛ/ raised, and /eɪ/ monophthongized, meaning that words like \"vague, egg\", and \"keg\" rhyme, more along the lines of /ɛg/. I'm vastly simplifying for my point, here, and the paper goes into various other aspects such as distinction between age and gender, but the gist is this merger.\n\nWhile the above is the closest description I have found to what I (and, anecdotally, others from my area) exhibit, and in fact how people from outside my home area *describe* what I exhibit (\"You said 'vɛg'.\"), my pronunciation is very much *separate* from those described by the study's findings. While I do rhyme \"egg\" and \"vague\" with a monophthong, I pronounce them with the close-mid vowel /e/, or at the lowest a mid-front. By my pronunciation, every instance of /eɪg/ becomes /eg/. Of course, this applies to words like \"bagel, plague, pagan, vague,\" and so on. However, as I mentioned, it also applies to a few words like \"egg,\" and \"leg\". Others of the class, however, are more variable, with \"keg, beg, peg\" being pronounced with a distinctly lower vowel sound than \"plague\" or \"egg\", remaining /ɛg/. I *have* noticed that this distinction seems blurred, however, having heard a more consistent grouping of words like \"keg\" with words like \"plague\", all under the vowel /e/, from some people in my home-state. Similarly, there is a very commonly-known shift in various parts of the West, in which /æg/ becomes, according to most definitions, /eɪg/. However, I often commonly hear /eg/ from people in my region too. I've noticed both forms of this shift existing alongside the previously mentioned /eɪg/ to /eg/, including instances where \"bag\" is pronounced /beɪg/, but \"vague\" is pronounced /veg/.\n\nThis is just one of many examples like this. While definitions and patterns, and even the ranges of well-attested sound-changes, will be defined one way, I will perceive something related but contradictory in my own region. While I know anecdote is just that, anecdotal, I also am a bit curious at the way \"The West\" is often treated in linguistics, as one homogeneous blob, when the people around me speak in distinct but patterned ways. There are clear differences between the northwest, southwest, and eastern parts of my state, separate from what I hear when I go to Nevada or Arizona. It's entirely possible I'm misunderstanding or misguided, and I am certainly not a professional linguist. I am, however, curious about this whole thing, and would be interested to hear another perspective or explanation.",

I'm talking about a language that has been entirely constructed from scratch, from its phonology and word roots down to its syntax and usage, such as one finds in richly fabricated sci-fi and fantasy worlds.\n\nI've heard it hypothesized (I honestly forget where, and would appreciate a source if anyone's got one) that if a group of pre-verbal infants were to grow up together having never heard any natural language, they would invent one from scratch, out of necessity of communication. I can't imagine any way to test this hypothesis that wouldn't be grossly unethical, but it wouldn't surprise me if this situation has indeed occurred in human [pre-]history. If this hypothesis were supported, it seems to me it would call into question the idea that humans invented language only once, and that therefore all human languages are ultimately related. It would open up the possibility that language isolates and highly unique language families could have indeed been artificial at their root, and truly unconnected to any other human languages. I think the implications would be equally as fascinating if such a hypothesis were to be tested and not at all supported. This, it seems, would lend support to the idea that language was only invented once, and that just like life can only come from life, real functional language can only come from extant language. Or, in other words, that natural language has properties that cannot readily be synthesized.\n\nOne fact that has been observed is that any human infant will develop the ability to communicate in any natural human language spoken by people in his/her environment. Would the same apply to any *non*-natural language a child frequently heard growing up? Again, I think the implications are fascinating either way, especially for the neuroscience of language and the idea of a universal grammar.",

        "text": "This has been on my mind lately. On the one hand, I don't see how any language would not reuse word sounds in such a way that two or more may correspond, and humans are good at noticing and exploiting patterns. Therefore, all spoken languages should have some kind of rhyming, in the conventional sense. On the other hand, there may be a language in which terminal sounds rarely correspond, or rarely correspond in any meaningful way, and therefore are never used to rhyme.  There may also be a language with a rhyming scheme, just not one based on terminal sounds. For example, perhaps only the emphasized syllable needs to correspond, or a combination of initial consonant and terminal sound must correspond for the native speakers to consider it a rhyme.\n\nDoes anyone know of either case (no rhyming, very different rhyming) in a real language?",
