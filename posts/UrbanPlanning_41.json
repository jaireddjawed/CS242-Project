Someone can live in poverty but still retain a normal level of inclusion in society i.e access to healthcare, to place of work, education, food etc. What I am interested in is where does transport come in to play in reducing the risk of someone becoming or staying in social exclusion.\n\nHow then can transport offer solutions to alleviate the impact of being socially excluded from society? Most literature based on studies in the EU reiterate the ideas of Accessibility, Affordability, Availability and Acceptability towards new transport policy. (I am not sure how this policy attitude will differ across the Atlantic in the USA as I know little on the American planning system's attitude towards transport planning).\n\ntl:dr how can transport planning be used to help the most socially excluded people from society become included?\n\n\n\n\n",

Lack of public transportation isn't exactly the fault of the suburbs as they can coexist. And boring is what I want my neighborhood to be, a safe place for the kids to play outside.\n\n\nI now live in a high density mostly communist built district and I don't have many things to do in walking distance, most people have cars and use them to drive when going to work or shopping.\n \n\nThose walkable European trendy neighborhoods with beautiful old buildings are not that common and they're expensive. They may seem they're everywhere when visiting Europe but living there is another matter. It's easier and cheaper to get a decent house in an american suburbs than almost anywhere in Europe.\n\n\nWhile vising the US I was really surprised with how pleasant the suburbs looked, even though some cities looked like one parking lot after another. In Europe, even though we have \"suburbs\", they are nowhere like those in America, sometimes they are more high density and shadier than the city.  I would take an american suburb over this [french \"suburb\"](https://i.redd.it/2w5l0tp5tvqx.jpg) any day.",

It can just get too political with your neighbours if planning is going on nearby. \n\nI also wanted to be somewhere they was well connected to public transport so that we could operate as a one car family.

And if you have any constructive feed-back for the first episode, I'd be highly appreciative! Thanks!",

Unfortunately, all the posts I see require years of experience, a Master's, or simply planning(or related) degree. I am in quite the conundrum and would greatly appreciate any advice on moving forward. Even better if you don't have an undergrad major in planning! :D\n\nThank you kindly for your time. ",

Even with the scholarships they gave me, it’s looking like I’ll end with around $36,000 in debt for the two year program. I am positive I want to be an urban planner and I feel confident in the program’s ability to prepare me for the field. My questions are:\n\n1. Is that a manageable amount of debt? I won’t have any from my undergrad and I’m a first generation college student so I’m just asking for advice from those in the field already.\n\n2. Are you happy with your decision to pursue urban planning? I know that things are difficult right now with the current administration with funding, so would you encourage a passionate and determined young adult to pursue this field? If not, please explain why.\n\nThanks everyone! ",

I had a couple questions, and I'd really appreciate some help:\n\n\n\nWhy was the urban model of Curitiba so successful? Was it the genius of the plan, the timing, the lawmakers' motivation, luck? Bit of all? Not taking credit away from the model itself, but if the model was so easy to implement more cities would've done it by now, isn't it? This leads me on to the second question, which is why haven't more cities followed the example of Curitiba? Why can't more cities take inspiration from Curitiba by modifying Curitiban systems to suit their needs and implement similar systems?\n\n\n\n\nThanks a lot!\n",

Finally, the farming community doesn't like threats to their ability to subdivide (which are on the horizon.)\n\nI understand this is a very vague question.

It was something u/spacks and I discussed and came up a lot in the [State of the Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanplanning/comments/80wsjs/state_of_the_subreddit/).\n\n* In an effort to combat that I have created an International Planning Page in the wiki, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanplanning/wiki/international) to round out the wiki and shed light on how the rest of the world plans. Its a work in progress and something I'm doing as a personal project in between school projects so would love any and all help.\n\n* Well I don't expect this to eliminate our lack of international content problem, I hope it provides resources for subreddit members to explore and become interested in planning internationally. If we expose ourselves to more international content perhaps we'll see more in the sub.\n\n* Please share your thoughts on this, and please critique / add to the wiki. It is quite primitive right now and I will not be offended if folks want to reformat or add different content.\n\n*Thanks!!*",

I have a survey that I'm asking them that only takes them a minute or so.\n\nIve gone to the businesses but I've had mixed luck getting in touch with someone to talk to. Every time I call/walk in and ask for someone who could help the employees say no ones available or to \"come back later\". Any ideas from planners on how to go about getting responses from them? ",
