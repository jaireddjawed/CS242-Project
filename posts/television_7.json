        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/11m0kaz/roots_1977_was_well_cast_well_acted_had_an/",
        "text": "I only recently watched this incredibly famous miniseries, Roots. It aired in 1977. It riveted America. It aired 8 nights in a row, with over 130 million viewers glued to the story of Kunta Kinte, a young man from the Gambia, who in the 1750s, was hunted and stolen from his homeland and forced into a vessel headed for the USA. \n\nAll American children learn about the transatlantic slave trade, and the violent and despicable concentration camps in which human beings were imprisoned. We were taught to call them “plantations,” but let’s be clear: they may have had things planted on them, but they share all the components of what defines a literal concentration, or internment camp: they were guarded, people were detained in masses, labor was forced, only certain ethnic communities were detained. \n\nI learned about slavery in history almost every year of school after age 10.  \n\nThe information in Roots was not “new” information to me. However, it was presented in a way that was entirely new to me and, as a result, I feel poorly about my relationship with and knowledge about US history. \n\nHow was it presented in a new way? It was very personal.  \n\nWe studied slavery in school, but spoke broadly about the atrocities enslaved people were forced to endure. I was never given a specific story to follow. I hadn’t realized it until now, but I never got a chance to identify with a specific person and follow their journey. In addition, as a teenager, 200 years ago seemed so very long that it almost felt as if that was a different world, which contained a different kind of people. \n\nRoots tells us the story of multiple generations of descendants of Kunta Kinte, ending with 1921 - right around the time my grandparents were born. When looking at it from that perspective, everything is much clearer: in the context of time, 1750 was just yesterday. Only a few great grandparents away.\n\nThere were also a lot of details that I knew on some level, but hadn’t thought nearly hard or long enough about. Watching it demonstrated dramatically helped me understand, and really analyze, what other humans are willing to do to each other in the name of money. For example, I was taught, and saw a few textbook illustrations of the horrible conditions humans were imprisoned in as they were sailed thousands of miles from the only place they’ve ever known. But, early on in Roots, there is a scene where a ship Captain and the First Mate discuss stopping to pick up “hardware”. The Captain questions what the hardware is for, and the First Mate explains the different kinds they will use and the advantages and disadvantages of different kinds of imprisonment hardware is discussed. \n\nI had to pause at that moment. Here’s a detail I never considered. The transatlantic slave trade removed over 12 million people from Africa. Those people did not go willingly, so they were imprisoned and shackled and this required hardware and other tools. That means that blacksmiths and other tradespeople spent thousands of hours heating and bending metal so that it could imprison other humans. Which led me to think of all the other thousands of people who were, in some way, complicit by way of ancillary or some other kind of support such as this.\n\nThe Captain of the ship is clearly uncomfortable with being complicit in this voyage, but participates anyway. It is clear from the beginning that this character was a device to comfort white viewers who might feel fragile watching white people commit horrific crimes against African people. There is a scene when the First Mate brings an enslaved woman to him “to warm him for the night.” The Captain refuses, because he does not “condone” that. \n\nI had to pause there as well. I knew that enslaved women were raped by their white captors and “owners”. For some reason, I never thought about how frequently this occurred. \n\nI also never thought about how many “plantation” owners fathered children who were born into slavery. I knew this to be true of Thomas Jefferson (although history sometimes paints his relationship with Sally Hemings as consensual - was it?) but I never thought about how incredibly wide spread it was. Every part of it makes me want to scream. The rape. The forced pregnancy. The juxtaposition of caring for a baby that you love, but was conceived in a hateful way. The idea that these men purposefully impregnated the women they owned so that the women would bear more humans, creating an opportunity for enslaved people that didn’t require “purchase.”\n\nI was taught in school that Africans were sold in auctions. Having only seen a picture in a textbook, I never thought a lot about what that looked like and felt like. It feels ignorant to write that, but it’s true. Not until I saw it played out in front of me was I able to put myself in the position of someone who is in a cage and about to be auctioned off. Here, I also had to pause.\n\nI set the scene in my head: I don’t speak this language and I don’t understand it. I haven’t seen my family in months, but if by chance one or two is still with me, they likely won’t be for long and I’ll never see them again. I’ve been separated from others who speak my native language so I literally cannot communicate with anyone. I don’t really know what’s happening, but I know it isn’t good - only evil and hurtful things have happened so far. I’m watching other Africans stand in front of a crowd, as people approach and inspect physically - lifting and looking at limbs, grabbing people by the face and opening the mouth to inspect teeth. There is a lot of banter in a language I don’t understand, and eventually, it’s my turn. I scream when someone grabs me and tries to pull me out, but they silence me with violence. \n\nOverall, I am impressed with the rawness of this miniseries. It threw a bone to white fragility, but it was also honest about how horrible it really was. \n\nThe acting in it is fantastic. The costumes are good. The make up is not, but that is easy to overlook. \n\nWhat isn’t easy to overlook, for me, is how incredibly poor the music is. The music style is VERY similar to what you might hear on “Little House in the Prairie”. Here’s the problem: it’s incredibly hokey. It doesn’t give even close to a sense of the gravity that is warranted by the scenes it accompanies. In fact, it adds levity to them. I have to wonder how many people weren’t able to fully immerse themselves emotionally because of this. There were times when I muted the show and watched it with captions, because the music was distracting in an insulting way. The music for a “sad scene” seems appropriate for someone’s dog dying, not your daughter being sold off to another plantation, never to be seen again. The music for a scary scene would have been appropriate for, maybe, seeing a wild animal and feeling threatened - not night riders coming through your quarters with torches, lighting buildings on fire and terrorizing your entire family. Not someone taking an ax to your foot so that you can never run away again.\n\nThough it came out in 1977, we can’t blame the poor music on the age of this film. Alfred Hitchcock was directing films with horrifying, emotion-filled scores decades before Roots was released. Even “The Ten Commandments”, which came out in 1956, had a similar style of instrumental score but conveyed much more drama. \n\nI am not usually one to pick apart details of a movie or a show. I can usually see the intent and appreciate it. I can overlook a lot. But the poor music in Roots feels almost criminal in that it detracts from the very grave nature of the show. I truly believe that if someone redid the original Roots with new music, it could touch a whole new generation and do so even more impactfully.",

For my school project, I need to create a international innovation. I am a bingewatcher, but I have to following problem: Most of the time I dont know how long it will take to finish the series, or if there is more than one season etc. I was thinking of building an application to see how long it will take to watch a serie or complete a whole collection. I also came up with some extra features, but that is for later.\n\nSo my question for you: Is this something you also struggle with and would you use this? If so, please let me know so I could make a good target audience to research and include in the making of this application.",

I recently gave Willow a chance and it was so good! It felt like a bunch of friends telling stories from their D&amp;D campaign. It was so bright and fun and whimsical.

        "text": "Hi everyone\n\n!I am working on a research paper for my final class in college and was told that I could use survey questions as a source within my paper. This is a criminal justice course and I am comparing the right that US citizens and prisoners have when it comes to the right to death. These are two very controversial topics that I will be comparing.\n\nPrisoners sentenced to life in prison and or on death row have the right to volunteer to be executed. This means those who are on death row may have to wait upwards of a decade to receive their execution date can opt-in to an earlier death, and those who have a life sentence can end their lifetime punishment by volunteering to be executed.\n\nI am comparing this subject to medical assisted suicide, also known as death with dignity. Assisted suicide is legal in only 9 of the 50 states in the US.In the other 41 states not only is the person requesting assistance, but any family, friends, and medical professionals who aided in the plan and death if it was carried out are at risk of receiving not only a fine of the minimum amount of $30,000 but also a minimum of 15 years in prison (according to some state laws).\n\nI am requesting that you will fill out the following three surveys (since I couldn't fit them all on one without paying) so I may gather some information to write my paper on.\n\nThese surveys are completely anonymous and I will have no way of knowing who filled out the surveys let alone who answered which question. Please if possible share this post so I may gather as much data as possible.\nAs I said these are controversial topics that my paper is on, however, I do appreciate everyone's help in allowing me to gather this data.\n\nDemographic questions\n\n[https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/T6NMTFN](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/T6NMTFN?fbclid=IwAR36k3u4fJcX8qFczlkmcSvYRcXFNT9yoeBFG_waQDcjina1XXwVA39ntZg)\n\nresearch questions\n\n[https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/WLRPV6B](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/WLRPV6B?fbclid=IwAR1Y0YJc7wxOsvzIKax6Yi4A6k3aFmB16ZtgEsNQvkqckW2MpWd_lZlYLdQ)\n\nadditional research questions\n\n[https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/TZVHGNY](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/TZVHGNY?fbclid=IwAR2vYYA-mC1yjwhgy2SPvLVMjmB5gBvBas6FQLVvBNrYXpkaXTBmp2YqKZA)",
