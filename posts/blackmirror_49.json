How many spin-offs of the same - albeit interesting and thought provocative - idea can they make? \n\nI’ve enjoyed every episode so far, and I will be watching season five, but I really hope it doesn’t contain any «I’m an AI stuck in cyber hell for all eternity» type of plots. Don’t you think the series has started to feel like a worn out iteration of the same basic concepts? I miss the pig fucking pedo shaming kind of episodes where you’re left thinking «shit, what if someone actually did that»!\n\nFor those of you who haven’t yet satisfied your want for AI torture, I’m sorry. I just needed to vent this somewhere.",

Their use of foreshadowing and choice of music is amazing.   Even after watching episodes 2+ times and reading discussions/watching videos, I'm still catching new examples. They also must had had a HUGE budget for all the quality songs throughout this entire series.\n\nI just noticed during my 3rd time watching San Junipero that after Yorkie and Kelly part ways the first night they met Yorkie steps in the puddle showing the moon in it's reflection.\n\nThere is no \"man on the moon\" like what we see from Earth.  No \"face\" is visible that is so clearly noticeable to us.  It's just a CGI that looks similar to our moon, but not exact.\n\nHave you caught any?  Or have questions about any?\n\nI also noticed in SJ that Kelly mentions everyone seems to dress like people they've seen in movies.  Later when Yorkie is trying on outfits she looks to have dressed like Molly Ringwald first with the song from \"The Breakfast Club\" playing, then a slightly trampy purple dress second that I can't place with \"Heart And Soul\" playing, then like one of the back up dancers from \"Addicted to Love\" as it's playing.  \n\nAnyone recognize the 2nd outfit from an movie from the late-mid 80's?\n\n",

The Entire History of You\nThis episode has the best emotion in the series. I think I'm okay in saying that Fion is a complete bitch too because she caused Liams obsession. \n\n3. Shut Up and Dance \nThe ending to this episode is a masterpiece. This is episode is shot very good with little easter eggs in the directing.\n\n4. Fifteen Million Merits\nThis episode truly fucked with me. The fact that he became the very thing he was against freaked me out beyond belief.

We also see this same technology in the cookies who are help captive in USS Callister and in other episodes. This is probably the same technology that is used in hang the DJ only the code is set up slightly differently for those copies. \n\nNow, for the second kind of cookie we’ve seen. \nEven back in White Christmas we saw the clear difference between these two types of cookies and we see it again but with a twist in USS Callister. We see the person who can go into the world and interact with the cookies and yet not stay. They are themselves. Not a copy. Everyone else is a copy. We can see this a bit in San Junapero. They go to this “place” but they don’t physically go. We see this over and over. \n\nI think this has to be a bigger thread within the show. ",

It's either the button thing that does whatever  the plot needs with your mind, or simulations of a consciousness, or some sort of augmented reality. Or all of the above.\n\nI consider there are plenty of new technologies and problems to explore, which already exist, such as genetic manipulation, workforce automation, global warming, ocean acidification, lack of human connection. Most of them have been mentioned in different episodes, but more as afterthoughts, rather than themes on their own.\n\nThe first two seasons had fewer episodes, but they where more diverse in content. Like first season, which had a real world episode, an interesting dystopia, and a slightly futuristic story. I miss the episodes that didn't need flashy, magic like technology to tell a story.\n\nIt can be interesting to see far in the future, but I need something like 'The National Anthem' from time to time. No just about the world changing, and people changing with it, but about how we have changed so far. If we take a look 20 years in the past, we can say that we are living in the future, and it has certainly fucked us up a bit.\n\nI wonder if I'm the only one feeling the same.\n\nThe show's still amazing, though.",

        "text": "So I'm currently working my way through series 4 and just finished watching Crocodile. I'm not sure whether a similar theory has already been posted so I apologise if it has. \nIn the early stages of the episode, when Mia's ex-boyfriend shows her the newspaper clipping about the victim's wife still looking for her husband, I had a thought. What if this woman was the wife of a completely different guy other than the one they ran over? I mean the article seemed to include one photo of the guy. Mia and her ex-boyfriend only saw the guy after he'd been hit and killed by their car and put him in the sleeping bag pretty quickly. I find it hard to believe that after 15 years the boyfriend (who hinted at being a recovering alcoholic) recognised this guy as being 100% their victim, based on one or two pictures (especially as they admitted to being over the influence at the time). I'm pretty sure there's a word for when killers misidentify their victims due to guilt, if they see a story with similar circumstances. I think it would have been an interesting twist at the end if somehow, a newspaper headline or TV clip, showed the wife had been reunited with her husband. So the whole killing spree Mia went on had been for nothing. ",

Over and over. I analyse every single little thing. I know this stems from my insecurity, but I just can't help it. It doesn't affect me so much (I hope), but I often lie awake at night and just replay various points of my life over and over and over and over, even little seemingly insignificant things... \n\nWhen he's in the cab, analysing the appraisal. How he rewinds, zooms, analyses the facial expressions, over and over. That is what I'd do. It was like watching a big bit of insecure me.\n\nAnd I see how much this ate him inside. Now only after he found out his relationship was broken, but even before that. His obsessive nature, oh so similar to mine, made him pick apart at every single thing. \n\nI need to be less like that. That's all I know. I need to not be that.\n\n",
