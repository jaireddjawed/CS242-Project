If you turn 26 before graduation, you're SOL until you get your employer-sponsored insurance.\n\nYou would think schools would be able to negotiate better deals similar to an employer-sponsored program, but it ends up leaving most of us legally insured but functionally underinsured after paying a pretty penny. \n\nSorry for the rant; I've been at this for the past few hours and want to pull my hair out.",

I dread going through my anki deck, doing practice problems, and reviewing everyday. I usually manage stress very very well. \n\nI see a lot of comments about how bad studying for Step 1/2 is. Is it going to get better? Should I push through this? I am definitely going to push through studying for my MCAT and will send my applications out, but I’m not sure if this is the right choice for me. I feel like I am in a pretty good spot for getting in, nothing crazy, but solid candidate. I am going to wait until I get in before making any decisions. \n\nI totally understand how some people can like and appreciate this life. I loved studying during undergrad and acing tests was so rewarding. I’ve lost that feeling and I’m so done with studying and schooling. To add I’m in this for money. I don’t feel some special higher calling. It’s a job, just like every other job, and I want to support myself. \n\nI feel trapped. I don’t know what else to do with a biology degree and at this point I’m considering other options like dental school just so that I don’t have to be busy all the damn time. I want to tend to my hobbies, watch movies, relax, and enjoy my youth. I’m so afraid I will regret stepping back from this because I know every job has its struggles. I just want to be able to enjoy my free time without having to juggle 100 commitments, manage time like a prodigy, and feeling guilty for not studying. \n\nI know non-med students belong in r/premed but I’d really like a perspective from you guys.",

I am super interested in ophthalmology as a career and this internship has some connections with Neuro-optho. I go to a newer medical school with no home optho program. I however do have some optho related research projects I could work on in the summer if I was here. They are in the lab but I have the option to work on it later on in the school year as well with a time crunch because of step 1 and school in general. I am working on some reviews and stuff already which can be done virtually. \n\nI was wondering if this internship would truly help my career. My entire stipend would go towards housing for the summer. Is the networking experience worth it? Or would it be better for me to just grind out research at school? \n\nOf note: my summer is 6 weeks so 4 week of internship gives me 2 weeks of rest",

        "text": "I saw two teenage siblings in clinic today who are both on \\~14 pills. At least a handful of the pills are for depression and anxiety and the rest are for headaches, chronic pain, supplements and vitamins. The kids take so many pills they've had to come up with creative ways to organize their medications so they don't forget.\n\nBoth kids are being homeschooled this year. The girl explained to me that public school has  \"ruined her life\" because of stress and anxiety so that's why she's being homeschooled now, but she's still sad because now \"she has no social life.\" The boy wasn't very talkative but having been his age myself I could tell he wasn't very happy with his life either. The single mom struck me as the kind of person who thinks giving her kids new pills for every problem is all there is to parenting.\n\nHere's what bothers me about this whole thing. School sucked ass for me. There were days I was red-faced and embarrassed as fuck because maybe I had no one to sit with at lunch or maybe I accidentally said something weird to a girl I liked. Or maybe there were classes where I was the last to be picked for teamwork and I would be embarrassed as hell to be that loser no one wanted to work with. Sometimes I would be in such an awkward social situation at school that it would weigh on my mind at home.\n\nBut school never \"ruined my life.\" I lived through those shitty days and became a more confident person. I grew into the person I am and stopped worrying so much about other people. Being the more confident human being I am now, I socialize and get along with people much more easily. I like who I am, and I look forward to my future.\n\nBy giving these kids medications for \"anxiety\" or \"depression\" we're preventing them from one-upping. Were preventing them from coming out stronger on the other end of the struggle. Instead we're just making them dependent on these pills (which cost money if you know what I mean). \n\nAnxiety and depression if you want to use those words are normal feelings which every socially awkward teenager feels. Sure, sometimes those feelings are overwhelming to the point where they need to be medicated but much more rarely than they are now. \n\nIf I had ever complained to my dad about feeling depressed or anxious or wanting to see a therapist he would've told me to man the f-ck up and quit being a p-ssy. I don't care for that language, but that's the kind of parenting which made me the man I am today, and I like the man I am today, so I think it worked. \n\nI understand what I wrote here is controversial and I could be very wrong about all of this as I am just a student who knows very little about psychiatry. I completely apologize if this post offends anyone and I am more than happy to learn from your comments.",

I am a second year medical student currently in pre-clinical courses where we work through simulated experiences and case base studies. I am very knowledgeable as I have been told and often arrive at the correct diagnosis. However, I feel that I really get stuck at certain points as I come up with too many differential diagnosis. I feel like often times I pay attention to every little detail and my mind races on possibilities of whats causing it. One thing that has worked well that my prof told me is creating two separate lists next to each other. Under one column I list problems and in another I list possible related diagnosis, then next to that write how to test/confirm it (labs/imagining) does anybody else have additional advice? I feel like im Dr. House MD (TV show character) sometimes where I feel like I need to analyze every little details as it could be signs of something else that we are missing",
