It's also the prime thread for requesting books or articles on a particular subject. As with all our weekly features (Theory Wednesdays and Friday Free-For-Alls are the others), this thread will be lightly moderated.\n\nSo, encountered an recently that changed article recently that changed how you thought about nationalism? Or pricing? Or anxiety? Cross-cultural communication? Did you have to read a horrendous piece of mumbo-jumbo that snuck through peer-review and want to tell us about how bad it was? Need help finding the literature on topic Y and don't even know how where to start? Is there some new trend in the literature that you're noticing and want to talk about? Then this is the thread for you!\n",

There is also a lot of concern that movies, video games, and music are significant factors in gun violence and murder, but from the research that I've done and that I have seen there is little evidence to support this. Violent video games, movies, and other media portraying murder and rape are easily accessible in almost every country.  Is there any evidence that hyper\\-sexualization, rape, or stereotyped gender roles cause more incidence of rape, or are factors in a significant number of rapes?\n\nNote: I am not trying to offend, belittle, or demean rape in anyway. I am just skeptical that western culture, and media in particular have anything to do with why people rape, or the rate which it occurs. That being said the US does have a higher rate or rape than most westernized countries.",

        "text": "So, I want to embark on a research on the effects of climate on the political and economic development of the state. I assume, as a part of my research, I would have to turn to history as well. What I have noticed is that the most of violent revolutions the world went through in the last millennia coincided with the Little Ice Age (1600-1700s), during which average harvest per acre of land fell, paving way for famines and battered living standards. Angry and hungry, the mobs revolted. This is just one example of how the changes in climate have come to shape world's history and politics. \n\nIn the modern world, almost all of the governments of the northernmost countries such as Canada, Iceland, Sweden, Finland, Norway (with Russia being an exception) are socialist-leaning. These countries also have the lowest crime and mortality rates in the world. Or, if you look at the behavior of humans living in different climatic regions, it seems as if the colder the area's temperature gets the more tempered and less violent the people become (compare, for example, Arabs, Persians, Turks vs. Poles, Czechs, Dutch). I acknowledge that this can simply be a random correlation, and I may be falling into a *post hoc* fallacy where there is a third factor that has caused the difference. Yet, I want to give this idea a fresh look. I would like to hear your thoughts.\n\nAre there any theories/books on the relationship between the atmospheric temperatures and the way people behave?",

But I was discussing this with my father as a thought experiment.\n\n* Millions, billions(?) can be squandered in a mere decade. \nSo how do famously rich families prevent inter-generational wealth loss?\n\n* Moreover when a family' has grand-kids how do they prevent the dispersion of wealth leading to a net loss? \n\nFor example in spite of it's growth the Forbes family has maintained it's wealth and status since the early 1800's.\n\nIt seems, even a wealthy families rely on having intelligent, hardworking kids who'll add to the family fortune, or at least not squander it. Better yet if a family can start, maintain, horizontally and vertically integrate multiple companies, large sums of wealth can be created and absorbed by the founders. (inferring) \n\nI'm still trying to figure out how wealthy families ensure their kids are smart, successful and money-wise. The lack of either of the first two traits could result in huge losses. Also in terms of family businesses- they can be run into the ground if the inheritor's aren't careful/knowledgeable.  \n\nAll this leads me to wonder if family names like *Elon, Gates, Zuckerberg and Woods* will be commonly known family names in the future.

It was impressed upon us that those fortunate few who got into the programs would be connected to anyone they wanted, but more importantly to those who're renowned within the field. Think, secretary of state, top diplomats, governors, etc.. Moreover the opportunities for travel, scholarships and education would be *second to none -* **globally**.  \n\nIn short, go to one of these graduate schools and you'll be placed into the elite largely by merit of having attended these schools. \n\nEntering America's elite seems to be a simple but expensive pipeline. Attend a private boarding school, then go to a prestigious, (preferably private) college, get scholarships, internships and network. Apply to (a *prestigious*) graduate school, excel, Publish articles, teach, network and finally enter the bottom echelon of the upper echelons at your first job.\n\nI know students who did similar things at my public university, sans the pedigree. *I.E:* Stellar high school and college grades, internships, networking and more. Yet they don't seem to be afforded the same opportunities that  those attending \"elite\" schools experience. \n\n&gt; So this brings us to the question:\n\n* Does an elite or aristocracy exist in America? \n\n* If so who is it composed of, how is \"membership\" gained and how is it lost? \n\nIt's interesting that some members of elite society gain it but for a generation- if that. Often pop-musicians and celebrities seem to enter into it for a few years only to spend more than they have without investing much or any of it. Nouveau riche compared to  Old money. \n\nBefore that informational I still held the belief that we all have an equal opportunity at \"success\" whatever the hell that is.  ",

I’m no sociologist or psychologist, but hopefully you guys can give me some insight into this issue so me and my dad can have an actually productive conversation, because as it is, we’ve kinda reached the extent of our own knowledge, and thus are at an impasse. Basically my dad believes that in any situation where someone has become such a messed up person where they can do something really awful, like shootings or other mass murders, that the sole responsibility for their outcome as a person, and as an extension, for the actions, lies with their parents. That there was something that they could have done, didn’t do, or ignored, that could have stopped that person from turning out that way. And while I think he’s right that parenting is a huge part of a persons formation, certainly there are other factors outside of a parents sphere of responsibility and ability that could lead to a person developing those tendencies. I don’t think my dad is wrong, but I think there’s a lot more that can influence a person, and the responsibility can’t lie solely with the parents, can it? What else can majorly influence a person, that couldn’t be blamed on parenting?",

But for my friends, those studies don't take into account 3 important factors :\n\nExperience :\n\n&gt; \"its very simple, people with more experience in their field will get paid much more than people with less experience, women or not.\"\n\nAmount of work hours :\n\n&gt; \"women work less hours on average than men, two different reliable sources ive checked support that claim.\"\n\nElected profession :\n\n&gt; \"some profession pay more than others. a software engineer gets paid more than a social worker, its not a gender issue, its just how it is because of the nature of the work. women tend to pick the profession that pay less than others (on average).\"\n\nAlso from him :\n\n&gt; \"there is a 4th factor that is not confirmed but that ive seen a lot during my time, women tend to negotiate less and be less demanding about their salary, if you take every offer you get, than dont be surprised you get paid less than others, man or woman.\"\n\nSo I checked some studies, I tried to find relayable sources on the Internet about equal pay, but it's really hard to find, specially when according to my friend,\n\n&gt; \"those studies are conduct by people with agendas, if they want to prove theres a wage gap, they'll just take a profession, divide the workers into 2 sub-sections (aka men and women) and show the salary average of both parties. if they want to prove the other way around, they'll twist the data to their advantage.\"\n\nSo, here I am, asking for help. I know it's a reality, I have seen it, and I bet most of you here have lived it. If you have any relayable source that takes those factors into account, please share them here, you have my total gratitude. i will try to find more on my side and hopefully I can make him understand the reality of others.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskSocialScience/comments/8j6xf2/is_leftwing_authoritarianism_a_real_thing/",
        "text": "So, I've read Bob Altemeyer's viewpoints on Authoritarianism, and I recall reading somewhere, either in one of his books/studies, or some statements of his, that left-wing authoritarianism isn't a thing, I believe because he said something along the lines of, those on the left are more likely to embrace change, and therefore, are less likely to dogmatically trust authority, at least to the point of authoritarianism.\n\nI then stumble across someone trying to talk about 'both sides having authoritarianism', which didn't make much sense to me, and I had to have a look for studies along those lines. Which brings me to this article here [about a study done by the University of Montana.](https://reason.com/blog/2018/03/08/tracking-down-the-elusive-leftwing-autho)\n\nThe thing that bothers me about this however, is the way the remodeled questions have been used, or at least the example one. \n\n&gt;For example, an item from the standard RWA scale reads: \"It's always better to trust the judgment of the proper authorities in government and religion than to listen to the noisy rabble-rousers in our society who are trying to create doubts in people's minds.\" In the LWA scale, this was adapted to read: \"It's always better to trust the judgment of the proper authorities in science with respect to issues like global warming and evolution than to listen to the noisy rabble-rousers in our society who are trying to create doubts in people's minds.\"\n\nTo me, this seems to ring like a poorly-worded attempt to find the result that they desired. After all, the reason that people would trust the authority of the scientist in the first place would be based off the science itself. Unlike the statements from the 'proper authorities in government and religion', the scientist is required to produce their work and show how they came to their conclusions and developed their statements to be factual. A politician, nor a priest, are required to do anything of the sort in order to be qualified as their respective job titles.\n\nSo, I'm curious: Am I just incorrect in, at least the examples given here, seem to have a bit of false equivalence to them? From the study itself-\n&gt;This authoritarianism symmetry hypothesis suggests that if researchers asked the right questions on the right domains, RWA and LWA would show similar properties for conservatives and liberals. \n\nFinding the Loch Ness Monster: Left-Wing... (PDF Download Available). Available [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322031834_Finding_the_Loch_Ness_Monster_Left-Wing_Authoritarianism_in_the_United_States)\n\nIt makes me feel more like the researchers are looking for the right questions to find left authoritarianism, or to disprove Altemeyer's RWA. Or, considering their studies were done by MTurk and undergrads at the University of Montana, could it be finding that those that consider themselves left-wing, or liberals, may not be all that left wing? Or rather, that there is a much wider group of individual viewpoints on the left wing, than on the right wing, due to the positions of our two major parties? From what they show of the questions in the study, it seems like there are some there that someone on the left would be unable to answer in their current form. It seems odd (and maybe I'm reading this wrong) that they would compare RWA's Religiosity to the hypothetical LWA's Attitudes towards Climate Change. Or, in the later MTurk test, they would compare RWA's prejudice towards environmental groups, but LWA's prejudice towards religious minority groups. It just seems like the two things that they choose to try to make equivalent are, indeed, not truly that equivalent.  \n\nAs the example above, I explained why a scientist would have authority: their work output would generally deem whether or not they are an authority on a subject, and their trustworthiness on said subject. Politicians and priests generally aren't judged entirely on their work output, nor does their work output generally consist of logical studies and hard numbers. An 'authority' in science generally consists of several groups of scientists coming to similar conclusions, using scientific method to develop the studies. Whereas an authority in politics or religion only needs the support of people to put them in the place of having said authority.\n\nI'm just trying to figure out if the study itself is flawed in finding poor equivalences, or if traditional political thinking of liberalism on the left is not quite as up to date as it once was. Would this perhaps more explain neoliberalism or centralism as opposed to further left ideologies, considering current US representation? Or does this indeed show that authoritarianism exists beyond fringe left ideologies?",

        "text": "Not sure if this should go here or under ask historians but giving it a try! I am about mid-way through Sapiens where the author goes in great details about how agriculture spread and took over hunter gathering societies not because it brought progress to the Homo Sapiens quality of life but only because it drove larger number of children, and over thousands of generation that led to the dominance of that type of societies. Evolutionary success seems just like a numbers game in that case.\nNext chapter is about sex equality and patriarchal societies, and he goes on about debunking a lot of the biological explanations on male dominance, but never brings up the idea that they might be more predominant just because patriarchy would drive a larger number of children. I have been looking for sources on birth rate in egalitarian vs patriarchal societies and it seems that indeed, not only in modern societies but also historically, egalitarian societies had lower birth rates but can’t find anything that really look into that idea.\n\n Anyone has some good sources/ideas to suggest?
