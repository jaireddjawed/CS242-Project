From date of purchase to my door, was only 7 days so hats off to CW for some quick shipping.\n\nThe was was developed for arctic explorer Tom Hicks as part of of Christopher Ward's Challenger Program. This program provides monetary support to individuals from varying backgrounds who are trying to do some good in the world. In the case of this C60 and Tom Hicks, focus is on shrinking pack ice around the poles.\n\nThe name 'Anthropocene' is the unofficial epoch we currently live in, where humans have a notable effect on the world around us, for better of for worse.\n\nI have to get to the dial first. It's the first frosted sapphire in a watch, and I'm surprised it took this long. It's absolutely stunning in person. Like a large chunk of ice its slightly opaque, and you can make out aspects of the Sellita SW330-2. The font and indices cash a shadow underneath themselves and it looks like they're floating on the dial, or for maybe a better term is frozen in ice. \n\nEverything else is the standard, incredible CW quality. The Lightcatcher case does its job at really making this thing sparkle, and the small beveled cuts on the indices add to the shimmer. Super-LumiNova X1BLC1 is exceptional and makes it glow a bright, sky blue at night.\n\nI'm more and more impressed by this brand as they continue to grow. They're launching the first true Super-Compresser in over 50 years, and it's another stunner. \n\nCheers CW.",
