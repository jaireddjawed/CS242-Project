How is it possible that amount of energy could;\n\n1 - Boost the shuttle into a stable orbit, \n\n2 - Achieve a rendezvous with the ISS,\n\n3 - Lower it's periapsis into the atmosphere and deorbit.\n\nThe core fuel tank never reaches orbit so it ostensibly the viking engines need to achieve these three things all on it's own.\n\nThe only thing which would make sense is if the core stage raises it's apoapsis to a rendezvous with the ISS before getting a stable orbit, effectively skipping stage one. \n\nBut still, the OMS needs to circularize and deorbit all on it's own, which seems quite excessive with only 300-ish m/s of delta-v.\n\nMaybe I'm stupid and is missing something, thanks in advance.",
