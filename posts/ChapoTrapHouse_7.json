Who knows? They might even argue that the right of a mother to eat her aborted baby is empowering. Either way I am confident that they won't have a problem with doing these things since they don't consider aborted babies to be human. So they'll argue that it's technically not cannibalism just like they already argue that abortion is technically not murder. The future of America and western civilization as we know it looks bleak, my friends.\n\n.\n\nThe only help I need is from fellow conservatives in the form of voting republican and finally passing laws that oppress you bastards just as much as you did to me. I don't give a shit if you're an American. I won't defend your right to anything as long as you remain a liberal. \"I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.\" What a bullshit quote. Dumbest fucking thing I've heard spewed out of the mouth of right wing libertarians. You and everyone like you deserves to be oppressed and persecuted by a conservative state.

I personally believe that an underratedly large component of Trump's appeal was that he campaigned against NAFTA and (in many ways its spiritual successor) the TPP, which Clinton eventually withdrew her support from. A lot of workers seem to really hate NAFTA and the idea of globalization and free trade in general. The naive leftist answer is that foreign nations are a scapegoat for capitalists to blame wage suppression on, when in fact it is the capitalists themselves who have been suppressing wages due to cheaper labor overseas. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what's the deal here? Was Trump right and free trade deals like NAFTA and TPP fuck over laborers in our country? Is that a bad thing overall?  What the fuck is up?",
