Section 965 of the bill creates a dividend [repatriation tax holiday] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repatriation_tax_holiday), a temporary reduced tax rate for U.S. companies to repatriate earnings from overseas subsidiaries.  \n\n[Several guidelines and requirements] (https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/js2195.aspx) needed to be followed to be eligible.  The IRS eventually produced three such notices outlining the [limitations] (http://www.taxhistory.org/www/features.nsf/Articles/E7A958612953C1EF852578FD00607975?OpenDocument).  If all the limitations were met, a [5.25% effective tax rate] (https://www.ntanet.org/NTJ/58/3/ntj-v58n03p331-46-tax-holidays-other-escapes.pdf) was produced and could be used for a year.\n\n\nWas this good or bad policy, and did it help or hurt the AJCA in achieving its stated purpose?  Can we quantify how much revenue was produced from the dividend holiday, and was this a significant amount?  Were the guidelines and requirements for repatriated money too strict, or not strict enough?  What other/better options are there for legislators to choose from?\n",

Since then, the US has essentially been engaged in [a low-intensity global war.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Terror) \n\nAs of last year, the government had [invoked the 2001 AUMF 37 times in connection with military actions in 14 countries and on the high seas,](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/pres-aumf.pdf) including in Afghanistan, Cuba (Guantanamo Bay), Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Georgia, Iraq, Kenya, Libya, Philippines, Somalia, Syria and Yemen.

From the founding of the United States until 1917, Congress directly authorized each individual debt issued. To provide more flexibility to finance the United States' involvement in World War I, Congress modified the method by which it authorized debt in the Second Liberty Bond Act of 1917.[3] Under this Act, Congress established an aggregate limit, or \"ceiling,\" on the total amount of new bonds that could be issued.\n\nWhat substantive change would a non-existent (i.e., infinitely large) debt ceiling be from the status quo? Is the debt ceiling the best way for Congress to handle its authority for borrowing money? If not, what would be better ways?",
