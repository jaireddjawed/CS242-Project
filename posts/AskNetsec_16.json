        "text": "Solved!\n\nSolution: thanks to u/HappyTile's comment. Port scanning websites only show your router's open ports and not your actual pc's. You'll have to disable the ports on the router itself. If your extra paranoid like me and still want to confirm that Windows firewall is blocking certain ports. You can check the app store for port scanning tools.\n\nSo I tried to port scan my home PC using [spiceworks scanning tool](https://community.spiceworks.com/tools/port-scan/) and noticed that these 2 ports are open. I tried blocking them in Windows Firewall both inbound and outbound but they are still open according to spiceworks scan tool. People commonly say that Windows Firewall is enough to keep you secure because of your router. I'm concerned that if I ever decide to bring my laptop in a public place for example, Windows Firewall wouldnt be able to do much. \n\nEdit: clarity\n\nEdit2: I'm staying in someone else's home at the moment so my firewall profile is currently set to public. Yet spiceworks is still able to see the open ports. Based on u/HappyTile's comment it's my router's port that is being scanned. I'll try to scan ports locally.",

Upon reflection, I realized that my answers were exaggerated as I was too focused on being honest, and I also had one genuine mistake. Not sure if it matters, but I live in the Netherlands and disclosed that it is legal there.\n\nOn the section regarding drugs I mistakenly put that the last time I smoked at 2018 instead of 2016 (this is the genuine mistake). Additionally, for the \"provide nature of use, frequency etc.\" I wrote: \"I smoke cannabis very rarely as I do not enjoy it to a large extent\". Secondly, for the \"provide explanation of why you intend to use this drug\" I wrote: \"I do not explicitly intend to smoke cannabis again. However, I plan on living in the Netherlands for the foreseeable future so it is possible that I will inevitably smoke cannabis at some point again. I also do not ever plan to use it illegally should I move to a different location.\"\n\nI'm worried this implies intent to smoke in the future, when all I meant was that I do not smoke but that the possibility remains considering my surroundings etc. I got caught up in the disclosure, disclosure, disclosure talk. Now I'm panicking and am wondering if I should send an email clarifying or wait for an interview (which they might not even give me considering it's an automatic disqualification for drugs?).  Or do I hope it slips through the radar? I would honestly appreciate any advice from you guys. Thanks in advance.",

        "text": "**TL;DR:** Amateur investigates popular home security app, finds potential problems via packet capture and receives disconcerting reply from app creators which undermines the app's reputation for being privacy and security friendly. \n\n**Basic Background**\n\nThis is a bit of strange one. I have been looking into setting up a basic home security system but can't really afford any security cameras right now, so I did a bit of research and found a popular, well received app that allows you to turn old smartphones into security cameras.\n\nI experimented with the app for a few days and was generally quite pleased with how easy it was to set up. Though reassuring sounding, the canned responses on their forums related to privacy and security weren’t very detailed. Since I was going to be allowing this app to run on my network, I wanted to investigate the app a bit more closely and see for myself if the claims about security and privacy offered by the app’s creators held true. \n\nA disclaimer here: I am a total amateur, with only rudimentary knowledge of networking, protocols and packet inspection. \n\n**App Security &amp; Privacy Claims**\n\nThe app creators claim that the connection between the phones acting as the camera(s) and viewers is maintained via an encrypted P2P connection, which according to my very basic investigation, is indeed the case.\n\nWhen you set up motion detection and the camera device captures motion, it notifies the ‘viewer’ and lets you watch a short video-clip of what triggered the motion detection. These clips, timestamps and thumbnails are uploaded to an AWS server. \n\nNow the app maker claims that all communications with their servers use TLS encryption and secure access tokens. They also claim that access to media on their servers is protected by randomly generated short term URLs, so only the viewer can access the media. \n\nOn forum posts, their customer service staff reiterate the point that ONLY the account holder can view the recorded clips and that not even the makers of the app or server admins have access to this media.\n\n**Packet capture &amp; possible contradictions to creators' claims**\n\nWhile I was inspecting a packet capture file in from the phone that was acting as the viewer in Wireshark however, I noticed a warning similar to this:\n\n“HTTP: Unencrypted HTTP protocol detected over encrypted port, could indicate a dangerous misconfiguration”\n\nThe warning was part of a packet which contained a JPEG thumbnail of the image. I wasn’t able to determine if any other sensitive information was contained in this HTTP packet, or what packet(s) actually contained the video. Now again, I’m a total amateur, but this seems a bit off – especially if the makers claim they use TLS for all communications.\n\n**Unexpected and troubling response from app creators**\n\nSince I was curious, I e-mailed their customer support team with some questions about how encryption is handled for the videos uploaded to their cloud/AWS servers. I wasn’t really expecting a reply, but lo and behold, they got back to me some days later. Their customer service rep explained that the video-clips were currently NOT encrypted at all, but reassured me that only very select few staff and server admins had access to these clips for maintenance purposes. \n\nThat was a total contradiction of the repeated assurances that motion recordings are private which I saw on their forums and FAQs.\n\nThough I am naturally skeptical about the privacy of anything connected to the internet, especially free apps, I have to say I was a bit blown away at their blanket admission of these two points. They claimed that their international (read: English) FAQ had some inaccuracies, in an effort to explain away these issues.\n\n**Why it (probably) matters** \n\nI highly doubt that the regular users of this very popular home security app would be pleased to find out that potential sensitive videos and thumbnail images are not encrypted and are accessible to an unknown number of staff members associated with the app studio – especially since the maker touts the usefulness of their app in domestic situations, such as for senior care or as a makeshift baby monitor. \n\n**My question:**\n\nMy background has nothing to do with IT or netsec, so I am in over my head here. My question is basically – how do I proceed? Should I keep the name of the app to myself and contact the makers of the app myself with my concerns? Is it ok to warn people who use the app? \n\nI have indicated my surprise and concerns to the makers of the app in my reply to their e-mail and suggested that they fix their FAQ and work on making sure their information offers an accurate assessment of the privacy and security of their product. I am however doubtful that they will do much in this department, as I am sure they would probably loose some business from more privacy-minded individuals. \n\nLastly, if indeed disclosing the name of the app is alright in this scenario, maybe somebody more experienced would be able to investigate for themselves to see if I’m totally off on my analysis. \n\n***On a side note:*** the app creators also claim that when you delete these recordings from your account (via the viewer or website) they are deleted forever, without any possibility of recovery, even by the server admins.\n\nI cannot verify this, and it is very possible I am wrong, but from my rudimentary analysis of packet captures, I did not see any requests going out to the server when deleting motion detection videos. It is very possible I missed them. \n\nPerhaps someone more experienced can verify that requests are going out to the server upon local deletion. I am assuming if you can really delete videos on the cloud permanently, some communication to the server must be made.",

This is not my first infosec job, so I think the following is not a company-specific problem.\n\nI'm doing all kinds of pentests for small and big clients. I enjoy the actual pentesting a lot, but there are a lot of tasks and things that I increasingly dislike. I don't like all this enterprise things like meetings, group calls and doing presentations in front of people who understand nothing of what I do. Just all this business overhead. The consulting part of the job. I'm not bad in these things, I just don't like to do them. Then there are a lot of clients who don't actually want a pentest, but have to do one. You have to call numerous people for every little detail of information or, even worse, they make up so many rules that you can't even find anything of importance. Then I have to write enormous reports which include every little possibility of vulnerability, in words that even non tech people can understand. I understand that this is important for the quality of the product \"pentest\", but I just don't enjoy doing it. I just want to get together with the developer in charge and show him the PoC of the big things I discovered. NO ONE needs an expensive consultant to tell you (in a comprehensive report) that you need a HSTS-Header in your Web-Application.\n\nFurthermore my job is taking a lot of time. I'm making slow progress to finishing my study and have absolute no time for any side projects. And that is really bad, because I have so many ideas in my head, that I just can't realize.\n\nAll these issues are slowly fucking me up, so I've come up with different solutions:\n\n1. Don't be a pussy. You are getting good money for something you really like. All these business overhead is the price to pay for that. Make up a proper time management plan and everything will be fine. CONS: This may fuck you up even more and the problem comes back even worse.\n\n2. Quit your job. Do bug bounty hunting. This is the real pentesting thing, giving PoC to qualified developers and all that with minimal business overhead. You are flexible in time and can finish your study earlier. CONS: No idea if I can do this for a living.\n\n3. Go back to software development. This is your original profession and you really like it. You can work flexible or even freelance and make good money, too. CONS: no infosec :(\n\nAnyone here that is in a similar situation? Does someone live of bounty hunting? Any advice? What do you think is the best option for me?\n\nThank you!",

During this time, I became addicted to video games.  It got so bad that I would be in school almost always sleeping. Thus impacting my academics. I also experimented with marijuana a bit; I bought it once off a dude and got before I could smoke it. The FINAL AND SECOND TIME I bought it and attempted to get high, but due to my lack of experience, I failed (hooooooraaayyyy). I had used a pen cap as a pipe and used the metal from the edge of an eraser to keep the plastic from burning and lit it with a match; I ultimately failed and GAVE UP, thankfully and haven't touched it sense.\n\n \nAs for my mom's BF-who at the time seemed like the most benign dude ever: the guy practically made turn against my mom by having me think that she was the \"problem.\" He would always buy me stuff like games, food, and tell me just awful stuff about my mom. \n\n\nMy concerns are:\n\n-Will an Agency such as the CIA and FBI contact this dude? If so, what if he bad-mouths my mom or myself? (PLEASE BEAR IN MIND THIS DUDE WAS AN ARTIST AT LYING SO PROFUSELY AND I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO HIDE) \n\n-Will my prior \"Drug experience\"/ Gaming Disorder hinder my shot at the CIA/FBI?\n\nLastly, my mom was born in Panama, but she became a citizen about 6 years ago. Will my family in Panama be an issue? My uncle, btw, is involved in politics over there.",

I'm quite sleepy so i just say 'fuck' and turned off the pc without checking much and go back to bed, after a little I get back again and check my phone to see a notification from my bank app, two rejected payments (254.47 €) due to insuficent funds, i belive made from my paypal to ZENMARKET. Now, i dont usually use paypal and it try to pay with the pre-paid VISA i use for internet pursaches and i only have the exact money i need so there wasnt money stolen so far.\n\nI turn on the computer and check the history and Google My Activity, what i see he did:\n- I see a search for TeamViewer, which he downloaded and installed (exe still on Desktop)\n- A search for Zenmate (some VPN) but i'm not sure he installed anything here\n- Downloaded WebBrowserPassView, which seems to recover stored passwords from chrome (the zip still in my Desktop aswell), this worries me and i'm changing my passwords, but at least I dont store any money related password (I think)\n- Open my mail (session already logged), there is nothing new on recycler bin or new messages but he might have deleted them. He might have use this to try to recover some password or just opened it by accident (it is my home page on chrome)\n- Enter PayPal, now as I said i dont use it so I'm not sure if the session was open or he used the password obtained from the other app or did something with my mail. He tried to make a payment of 300€ to a ZENMARKET.jp account or something like that, i'm gessing this is what got regected but i'm not sure why it show 264.47 on my bank (maybe exchange rate or commissions from the page idk). If i go to the page it is still logged to an account with what it seems the bare minimum information and all fake of course, no visible mail, only user name etc.\n- At the end it seems he open PrimeVideo, idk if the fucker wanted to watch a film before loggin off or what\n\nSo i'm formatting my PC tonight but before i do i'd relly like to know how he got in initially, i've run malewerabytes and defender, malwerabytes only found some warnings (most of them from WebBrowserPassView which was downloaded once inside, but nothing really suspiccious) and defender found nothing.\n\nI've tried to check the windows events but i cant get anything clear from them, i a crash from teamviewer but nothing else, i dont know if get how this events work or if its just nothing in them.\n\nI've checked the TeamViewer Connections_incoming.txt which has one line but i dont think i can get anything from it it shows my username, some times (01-08-2018 02:31:15\t01-08-2018 02:43:28), some alphanumeric codes and some X and some number.\n\n\nSomeone has any idea or recommendation on what to look for or what to do?\nThanks!",

These sites both offer online customer support chat, and both of them have the same issue. They let you upload an attachment to the chat, which is intended to be used for an image, but they let you upload any filetype that you want, not just a jpg or png or the like.\n\nThat made me curious, what are the ramifications of something like this if someone malicious decides to exploit it, if there are any at all?",

I'm of the belief that 95% of users of typical web platforms would benefit from social login security, but this is a complete non-starter whilst a minority of users will swear by their password managers. Hence their use needed to be detected somehow so they don't get nagged to add social login.\n\nDo people see what I'm getting at?",
