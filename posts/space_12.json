        "text": " I've tried astrophotography a few times in the last year, but I always get terrible results. I live in an area that says it's Class 4 Bortle, but in reality, I get a ton of light pollution on the right side due to the largest city having the lights up at night, and on my left side I get a ton of light pollution due to the street lights being turned on. I don't have equipment besides my S21 FE and my old phone Honor Play. I do have binoculars but I can't shoot through them, and the app I use to shoot my photos is \"DeepSkyCamera\" which can't use any other camera other than the 1x (It can't use 3x), so all I'm left with is digital zoom, which I don't want. When I stack even 300 images I get the Orion nebula (after autostreching) looking like this: [https://prnt.sc/MFQcuTlgAjBL](https://prnt.sc/MFQcuTlgAjBL), and Andromeda looking like this (after using curves and autostreching) [https://prnt.sc/owAL-\\_9Sjv-G](https://prnt.sc/owAL-_9Sjv-G), basically, all of the shots that I take end up extremely low resolution, with a ton of noise even with taking 50-300 lights and stacking them in DeepSkyStacker, following all the recommended settings which apply to my shots. I take Darks as well, (around 10-50 of them), but I'm likely doing them wrong because all I am doing is setting the phone down, while not changing any of the settings (basically capturing the ground), which does result in a black signal with a bunch of cold and hot pixels as my lights do (they also contain a lot of hot and cold pixels as well). I also take Bias shots, doing the same process as I did with the darks, just setting the shutter speed to 1/12000s. I suck at taking flat frames, and when I stack my images with the flat frames, the resulting image looks even worse than without them. I need to find a suitable method since the one I'm using is obviously lacking. The RAW images I take end up in 4000x3000, which is too low for taking really zoomed-in objects like the Orion Nebula or the Andromeda Galaxy. If only the app I used had the ability to use the telephoto camera, since then I could take those shots at a way higher resolution. I take my lights at 50 ISO and 8-second exposures since turning up the ISO to 800 or 400 ends up really bright due to the light pollution. I also haven't found a working (and recent) version of GCam without having the viewfinder freeze after a few seconds. My rig consists of a meter-tall log that my dad uses for cutting up wood, a towel on top of the log so I don't get splinters, and a cardboard box cut so that I can put my phone there vertically to position the phone \"relatively\" close to the target, which doesn't even matter since my images capture like 1/5th of the entire sky. Do you have any advice as to how I could improve my images?",

        "text": "A recent post got a lot of attention. Unfortunately the Fermi Paradox is one of those topics (alongside dark matter, black holes, etc) that invite an incredible amount of [bikeshed discussion](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/bikeshedding).\n\nWithout stating my own opinion on the Fermi Paradox, I wanted to clarify a common misconception, which was unfortunately present in that post:  The Fermi Paradox does not depend on SETI or radio telescopes. Based on what we know of astronomy and life, aliens should have already conquered the entire galaxy and they should have been right here on Earth before humans even evolved. Forget radio astronomy, forget the \"Wow\" signal, and forget SETI funding. Instead ask yourself why aliens are not literally right here on Earth right now.\n\nIf you just figure out why aliens are not right here on Earth right now, you will essentially have solved the Fermi paradox.\n\n* You think maybe planets with life are rare? --- See the [Rare Earth Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_Earth_hypothesis).\n* You think aliens don't develop technology? --- See the [Great Filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter).\n* You think aliens don't travel? --- ***None*** of them travel? Out of potentially millions of species? You have to either postulate that nobody wants to travel, or something prevents them. The first option is implausible and the latter is the Great Filter again.",
