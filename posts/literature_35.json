        "text": "I was just struck with a realization about a story I haven't read since junior year of high school. Does anyone remember the short horror story Young Goodman Brown by Nathaniel Hawthorn? \nA young puritan man goes for a walk in the woods before sunset, leaving his wife, Faith, and meets the Devil along the way. \nThe devil tells him that every one he knows, even his father and grandfather, have been friends of his and have done evil things in his name. \nIt all culminates into Goodman Brown finding a Witches' Sabbath/ Devil worshiping service going on in the woods, and his wife, Faith, is about to be inducted into the cult. \n\nAnd the most iconic line of the story is \"I have lost my Faith!\" referring to his wife, but also being a very on the nose reference to Christian faith. Basically the story ends with Goodman Brown going home to his wife and isolating himself from everyone in his life because he thinks they are evil witches, and he dies with a reputation of being a cold, distant man with no friends. \n\nGuys, I just realized when he says \"I've lost my faith\" He wasn't referring to his faith in God or his wife, he was talking about his faith in people. \n\nThe story is a metaphor for how letting suspicion lead you too far into your own head can make you distrust even the people you are closest to without any real proof.

But I found the writing to be overwrought and unpleasant to follow. The plot itself is simple, and I get that its at least in part about how horrible people can destroy the lives of those who love them... but what am I missing? The monologues seem to be the real point of the book, but after I finish them they all leave my head immediately. And the end? I thought Robin was fighting Nora's dog, my friend (in my three person book club, only two of us finished it because the third noped out about 12 pages in) thought she was trying to have sex with it, but neither of us has any idea how it fits into the greater context of the book or what it means.\n\n\nSo now I'm pouting because this book made me feel super stupid and I don't know what I was supposed to get out of it, and all the reviews I've read are just a bunch of \"Oh its so wonderful and groundbreaking\" without saying why or giving analysis.",

        "text": "So, this summer I am attempting to read through some classic literature that I have had on the shelf for a while, this last week my choice was Nicholas Nickleby.  I thought that every now and again I might bring my selections here to start some discussion and get some perspectives on some of the things I'm reading.\n\nThe only other Dicken's I had read befor bring hiswas Great Expectations, so I was pleased to find that Nickleby contains some similar elements in story and tone that draw me to this kind of literature.  It's overly optimistic, many of the characters, especially the protagonists (as is often the case) are archetypal and lack nuance (which is funny, as Dickens preface indicates that Nicholas was seen as something other than perfect, although I strain to find him struggling with any kind of internal flaws at any point, he seems to be our moral compass throughout...), the plot is driven by convenient cotrivances, and is somewhat bloated (thanks to the publication methods o the time I gather) for its overtly stated purpose to discredit Yorkshire boarding schools.  And I loved it, every little bit of it.  Predictable, yes.  But humorous, beautiful, and fascinating in the way it unravels.\n\nJill Muller wrote the introduction to the B+N edition I own, and sheds a fascinating light on the novel.  She speaks mainly to the theatricality of the work, that it draws it's strength from, and attention to the artificiality of its substance.  Thus we are drawn behind the curtain of a sham acting troupe, and various characters (Noggs, Squeers children, the people Miss La Creevy Paints) showcase the theatrical artifice of society.  Perhaps not commenting on it, but subtly revealing the power, prevalence, or just the humor of this notion. \n\nIn semi-connection to this, I also read Anti-Clerical Gothic: The Tale of the Sisters in \"Nicholas Nickleby\" by Rodney Stenning Edgecombe which cleared up, to some extent, some confusion I had over the purpose of the framed story telling near the beginning.  Edgecomb posits that this, again, is part of the intricate artifice woven into the text.  The story of the sisters  is a tale of origination entirely fabricated by Dickens in the style of such folklore, but one that was often mistaken for a true folktale, reality mimicking art and all that.  Edgecomb also further elaborates on the possible ways this revealed Dickens religious views.  The ascetic and dower depiction of the clergy contrasted with the reverent, yet decadent maidens serves to show the need to allow enjoyment of life to coincide with religious service.  \n\nTo finish my ramblings, I was specifically interested in the inspirations Dickens takes here from Cervantes.  I recently read Don Quixote for the first time and the connections stand out now, but I believe service the novel well, rather than detract from it.  The hero and his dimwitted but loveable sidekick go on a picaresque adventure that reveals small truths or makes small observations about various members of society.  Lambasting real life plagiarizers who were attempting to cash in on the novels success.  The aforementioned commentary on artifice, deception or suspension of disbelief are in common here.  Even the chapter titles bear a sort of similarity I find amusing.\n\nSo, I'm not necessarily looking for a response to my reaction to the novel, but want to hear all your takes on it.  Likes, dislikes, connections, favorite passages, memories, scholarship, what have you.",
