        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badlinguistics/comments/61s380/in_which_slavic_preserves_the_rhyming_base5/",
        "text": "I found a [paper](http://jandacek.com/proto-slavic-concepts/base-ten-counting/) that speaks of a pattern of consecutive numerals ending similarily in Slavic:\n\n&gt; In all the Slavic languages, the numerals 3 and 4 categorically rhyme with the ending “RI”; the numerals 5 and 6 might have rhymed with the ending “E*T”, where the asterisk indicates the possibility of the pristine existence of sound S in both numerals; the numerals 7 and 8 categorically rhyme with the ending “-M” or on rare occasions they rhyme with ending “-N”, where the – sign indicates the one and the same vowel; and the numerals 9 and 10 categorically rhyme with the ending “ET”.\n\nThe paper provides tables that at first glance seem to support this, so I don't think this part is bad linguistics. However, it also claims it is from Proto-Indo-European, since such regularity developing from irregular endings is an absurd idea:\n\n&gt; It is unlikely that thousands of years ago some Indo-Europeans conspired to impose a binary rhyme or uniform endings of numerals. It is a counterintuitive idea that the Slavs segregated themselves from other Indo-Europeans with the contrivance of the “RI / E*T / -M / ET” rhyme. It rather is likely that the original Proto-Indo-European tongue had this feature of rhyme for numerals.\n\nProblem with this is that none reconstructions of PIE numerals I've managed to find support this pattern. I guess the author sees this is a problem with our reconstruction of PIE, instead of the theory:\n\n&gt; On the other hand, we can extrapolate back into Indo-European prehistory and speculate that ancient languages also had matching endings.\n\nand\n\n&gt; We may find the origins of Indo-European words for numerals in ancient Slavic etymology.\n\nThere is also an argument that IE languages originally had a base-5 counting:\n\n&gt; S JEŠTĚ is the Czech for with yet or with yet more. To me this appears as a likely candidate for ŠEST, the common Slavic word for “six”.\n&gt;\n&gt; If the argument for six does not seem compelling – consider SE DVĚMA or SE DVOUMA or SE DVĚMI (with two) as the root for SED-M, (the Slavic word for “seven”).\n&gt;\n&gt; OS-M rhymes with SED-M and “V” present in some Slavic languages in VOS-M means inside. Thus, eight is the number with seven inside.\n&gt;\n&gt; DEVĚT (Nine) and DESET (Ten) have the same “ET” ending. DESET may be a corruption of DVE pĚSTE (two fists). STO (Hundred) has the “ST” element as in “deSeT “.\n&gt;\n&gt; TISÍC (Czech), TISOČ (Sln) may be a corruption of DESET-SET ® TISET-SIts. Certainly, this is all rather speculative, but I am not aware of better REASON to go with the RHYME.\n\nThis feels to me like quite a stretch. Also, these are based on slavic languages only, and disregard all other branches of IE, including ones with much longer written history.\n\nBonus: Basque is Indo-European (emphasis mine):\n\n&gt; Based on this observation, we can divide the Indo-European languages into two groups: On the one hand there are the languages, which have uniform (rhyming or non-rhyming) endings for their numerals: Baltic, Slavic, Sanskrit and *Basque* belong to the group that has numerical endings configured and integrated. On the other hand there are the Germanic, Romanic, and other languages that have the endings disfigured and disintegrated.",

        "text": "A few months ago, [this image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C04HAyaUAAAKsR2.jpg) was making some rounds in Twitterspace. The message reads, using a more conventional spelling:\n\n&gt;No te compares conmigo porque ni muriendo ni volviendo a nacer serás como yo, porque lo que a ti te falta a mí me sobra y eso se llama inteligencia, sin tener que graduarme de la universidad que con eso se nace bendecida por Dios.\n\nEnglish:\n\n&gt;Don't compare yourself with me, because not even dying and being reborn you will be like me, because what you lack I actually have a lot of, and that's called Intelligence, without having to graduate from college, cause you're born with that, blessed by God.\n\nSo the meat of this otherwise inane and self-congratulatory post is that the spelling the person uses is very, very poor. This sent off alarms throughout a section of the social networks and, predictably, people started making merciless fun of the OP. Needless to say, along with standard, run-of-the-mill pedantry, there came a generous dose of misogyny and sexism at the woman who *dared* express a bit of sexuality and self-confidence.\n\nLike the buzzkill I am, when somebody showed me the screencap I didn't laugh outright and instead I focused on reading the message and noticing the peculiarities of her dialect. What I noticed was that, if you looked beyond the non-standard spelling, you can actually notice some rather interesting choices that point at being innovations in her particular dialect of Spanish. \n\nThe person who wrote this is obviously not very educated and is probably working class. She probably learnt the value of the letters of the Spanish alphabet but is otherwise oblivious to the more archaic and legacy conventions of written Spanish (eg v/b and g/j allophony, acute accents to mark stress, etc). As such, I suspect she wrote the message with nothing but a basic knowledge of the Spanish phonology associated to Roman letters and her own knowledge of her dialect. Among the things I noticed:\n\n* The loss of -s at the end of 2sg verbs. Very common and well-recorded amongst many dialects of Spanish. The woman omits them entirely.\n\n* l/r rhoticity before plosives. She writes “bor biendo” and “farta” instead of “volviendo” and “falta”.\n\n* b/v allophony. She completely omits “v” in favour of “b”. “v” is a legacy character, as [v] does not occur in most dialects of Spanish.\n\n* More interestingly, the case of prepositions and datives in her message. With the exception of “con migo” (which is kind of funny because its spelling as a single word is actually the exception amongst Spanish datives), the woman writes down dative nouns and their associated prepositions as being a single word (“anaser”, “a nacer”; “comoyo”, “como yo”). Dative pronouns are also interpreted as being a part of the verb they modify (“tefarta”, “te falta”; “mesobra”, “me sobra”; “sellama, “se llama”). The preposition “a” (EN “to”) is used as a dative marker (“anaser”, “ati”, “ami”). Could this be indicative of a nascent system of inflection?\n\nSure, this could all be coincidence, or even a troll post fishing for likes and rampant misogyny. I, however, found the evidence somewhat suggestive, and it is definitely in line with the common knowledge of diachronic change. Removed from the influence of modern orthography and mass media, the person was able to use a narrower phonemic transcription of her dialect and, more importantly, give some insight into what seems to be a sort of inflectional system springing up from a non-inflectional grammar.",

A lot of people picked up the rant and ran with it, some because they thought it was funny and others apparently genuinely out of a belief that this was a real and important distinction.
