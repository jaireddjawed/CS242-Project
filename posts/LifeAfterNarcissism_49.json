        "text": "Therapy is expensive. I've been writing as a form of personal therapy.\n\nAfter living through this, I can't see life the same way. It's like life itself descended from a trauma (the big bang?), and everything afterwards was bound to be ruined, including me, even the city I live in; everywhere I look; all I see are the products of this narcissistic vanity, and considering I wasn't armed with the know-how to live in the world, the world seems all the more abrasive to me; repulsive to me. For months, I wouldn't visit my Mom. It was not from a place of contempt, or anything: it's just that I only have so many days off per week and I don't want to have my emotions shattered on one of those days, that's all. I suppose that's why my nFather started texting me; I guess he was becoming uncomfortable with whatever my eMother was saying, because I had admitted to her that I could not come over, because it was a trauma to come over, which, I'll admit, is a harsh thing to say.\n\nHis texts were incoherent; he was saying things just to say them; just to hurt my feelings. After two days of getting phone calls (he wasn't leaving voice messages) and me not answering them and him sending me absurd and antagonistic texts, that meant nothing. He, again, texted me early in the morning, and I replied. \n\nI was brief and to the point in ways I never was. Maybe because of my self-imposed writing therapy. How and what and why, were my choice words, so I could reach the bottom line. Very quickly, my phone recorded the evidence of his antics. He claimed to be messaging me under the pretext of me calling him first, when I had not. I told him to check his call history, and he said that he, since he is not a paranoid (gaslighting?: he said my fixation on evidence was due to ADHD and aspergers), does not keep his call history, but deletes it. I told him that was insane: people are too lazy to do that, is, more or less, what I had said. Then, I sent him a picture of my call history, the proof, which, however, he rejected as a fabrication. (note: this was early in the morning and I am using a version of Android where you can't delete one call from your call history) At that point I felt that I had gathered a lot of evidence, in a short amount of time. You're pathological, I said. Don't contact me again, I said. He sent me more texts and I ignored them.\n\nMy childhood memories have been replaying in my mind all day. Why my father always had so many \"enemies\" ... why he was always \"battling\" with people ... why he would say things like \"you either love me or hate me\" or \"you're either with me or against me\" ... why things became \"normal\" when he left for business trips, and so on.\n\nHere's what really stings: there were opportunities for me to escape, but I never took them. \n\nThere was a time when child protective services were investigating my parents, who, at the time, I loved.\n\nThere was an older, grandfatherly, figure, who was a friend of my dad (and he was a good person). My father, while battling with me, had forced me into writing back and forth with me, in an effort to come to terms with him, and my father, since, I suppose, he could tell that I had respected this person for his obvious intelligence, took me to him, so he could determine who was in error. I don't recall the contents, but he had me write a kind of terms and conditions agreement, at the age of thirteen. He decided in my favour. What I wrote made sense. What my father wrote was sheer nonsense. That was his conviction. Not only that, but everything my father had made me do, the whole effort to prove my error, seemed completely reprehensible to him. \n\n*\"What your father did was wrong.\"* he said. *\"You can come to me for help; you could always live here.\"*\n\nI keep thinking what my life would have been like if I had asked him for help: if I could've developed with the aid of his intelligence, how that could have shaped me into a better person. I don't know anything about him, or if he's even alive! I'm not sure, I've been talking to my uncle, who I also respect for his intelligence, and I think it might be a good idea to send him screenshots of this encounter. \n\nYou see, I've been trying to figure out my tropes, and why I think the way I think, and I feel like if I open out about this kind of thing to him I can heal more, but, at the same time, I'm sensitive to the idea of exposing him, unnecessarily, to my parental drama. I feel weak for even needing to do this: shame. What do you think?",

I don't know what was said but in her follow-up email to all of us she seemed to chalk it up to a misunderstanding.\n\nThen today the project manager was emailing me and texting about it's \"important\" that we talk now that some \"issues\" have been brought to her attention.\n\nWelp, we tried having a talk after class today and she went STRAIGHT back into \"are you going to do X, Y, and Z?\"  in a scolding.  She clearly didn't give a shit about clearing the air or finding a compromise or any of that.\n\nSo naturally my attitude was \"fuck you\" and I just told her \"I don't know\" in response to her questions.  I told her we will definitely meet our 4pm deadline tomorrow but I don't know about the deadlines *she* is trying to impose for 10pm tonight and 10am tomorrow.  And she was all like \"well, it's hard to plan with 'I don't know'\".  Like, duh.  That is a consequence of not planning better earlier.\n\nI'm supposed to spend TWO HOURS in a room with these rude women tomorrow, preparing our presentation.  It's going to be a bloodbath.",

Then I made another one in Sept? that I was in school. I want to make another one at the end of my first semester.\n\nFirst off, thanks everyone for their encouragement and support. It was nice to read other people's experiences with going back to school and I often thought about you all and how if you can do it, I can do it too.\n\nSecond, I'm doing really well! I just came out of a super stressful 10 day period where I had a midterm, a test and an essay due. My husband was super supportive and I got all my studying and writing done in time. I'm not sure my essay was any good because I only started writing (had finished researching a while back) three days before it was due. I was really scared of repeating a past mistake where I plagiarized and failed a course. I didn't identify that fear until I handed in this essay so for next time I have a good plan going in to any essay assignments.\n\nI got some tests and writing assignments back. I got 95% on an assignment! And I got a 76% on the test, 5th or 6th highest in the class :)\n\nThe test and midterm I wrote recently were not easy but I was SO prepared. And I studied so hard. I've been to every single class (except one because I had a medical appointment) and taken handwritten notes so I wouldn't be distracted. I've spent hours in the library and my home is still running smoothly as ever.\n\nMy sweet husband made dinner and washed dishes after coming home from work so I could study and write. My uncle, aunt and cousins have been checking in on me and wishing me luck on my tests. My grandma was proud when I told her the grades I was getting back. I've never had this before.\n\nI wish I had had this sort of support and love from my parents, I would've been so far along. But what's done is done and they don't get to have a part in my success so that's a victory!\n\nThe academic advisor I was so happy to meet with let me down with some incorrect information. So I've decided to drop him as my go-to and try some other advisors. I was pretty bummed out on the day I found out some of the info he gave me was wrong but it didn't really change much about my situation.",

        "text": "First, I'd like to give a big thanks to r/rbn and LifeAfter. Never have I ever in my life found such a big, amazing group of people that can always give comments/upvotes almost any time. (95% of my post got replies) I love this site. It's my support network. At my most difficult period, this year's September, this site has given its biggest support. For once in my life, I want to say, thank you, rbn, for making me stronger. \n\nAnd another thing I'd like to bring out, is that through all these things, my healing technique has gone better. \n\nOne minute ago I was still posting about my sexual abuse life, and next minute I felt much better, and energized by the songs and quotes for the survivors. Yes, I still rely on these things to alter my mood. (DID-like) But I'm much better than the past - I am not afraid of darkness anymore. I am not afraid of sleeping on my own, in the mist of darkness(Just a metaphor, I am self-healing good).\n\nAs I said, I am self-healing good. Never in my life I went to a point that I can almost 'automatically heal' my wounds, just like that. I am amazed by how great me, a human being, can heal like a snap. \n\nI'm not exaggerating here, I'm a sensitive person(HSP), I feel things intensely(100x) and also heal intensively. It's like something I've discovered by myself. \n\nSo yea, it amazed me a lot. I've learnt a lot because of you guys, all of you. Even I am still wounded, I feel like I can walk this journey on my own, in no time. I seek help constantly, but one day I will give back to this community. When I am no longer controlled by triggers, emotional incest, I promise I will give back to this community. And I'll do my best to live well. \n\nSo that's all my sharing. My main point is to see if anyone can heal very fast too - Is it just me? Do I have a potential? Please share something, I'd really like to know. ",

        "text": "1. I'm a hippie who hates organized religion and people \"praying for me\"\n\n2. I just told you that my parents abused me and that's your response?? \n\nOk I'll back up. A lady my mom used to work with like 15 years ago is a face book friend of mine. Idk why. Anyways, wished her a happy birthday and she responded with a thanks and telling me to give my mom a hug and a hello. So I private messaged her. Here's what happened:\n\nMe:I just wanted to message you here. I haven't spoken to my parents in almost 2 years when I realized my dad is an abusive narcissist and my mom is the enabler. They've done some pretty horrible things to where I had to establish no contact. They're both pretty emotionally and mentally abusive unfortunately:(\n\nHer: Oh gosh!!!!!!!! I don't think there are enough exclamation marks! My heart is broken to read that...I had no idea. I didn't know your dad, but I worked side by side with your mom at the health dept in ***** County. I can't imagine both your pain and her pain. Especially since you have a precious, little baby!!!! I can't imagine a grandma's heartache to be separated from them. I am so sorry to hear this, but I am so glad you told me. Obviously, you have to do what is best for you and your family. Please remember though that we all have our faults...there are days I could break all the dishes (or worse!) in our home because my hubby makes me so mad. Or there are times when I feel the anger rise up inside of me because my mom cheated on my dad when I was 5 years old so I grew up in a broken home and had to be shuffled between households during every summer break, Christmas break and Spring break rather than spending time with friends. But, I give up the anger and resentment and give it up to God, and then I give thanks for where I am with a life I didn't even dream of having. \nI will start praying for you and your family, Retrobebe, that you can all be reunited somehow. You may be too angry to want that, but that is my hope for you and your mom especially (since she is the one I know). Don't you have another sibling? How is he handily everything? How about your hubby? I will also tell you my mother-in-law is crazy, but she loves her grandson so I do make attempts to keep the relationship going.\nOkay, thank you again for sharing with me!!!!! Again, I loved seeing joyeax anniversaire on my FB!!!\n\nMe: Sorry to share that with you on your birthday! My parents put on a good show unfortunately. I tried for a long time to set boundaries and work on the relationship and the emotional/mental abuse just got worse. My dad \"disowned\" me when the family dog died because my husband emailed him back instead of me. That's just the tip of the ice berg.  It isn't just normal family stuff. It's full on PTSD inducing emotional and mental abuse and honestly, I don't ever want to be apart of that family again. Why would I go back into a burning building? My anxiety and depression are almost gone and I'm making great strides in my recovery. It was in having my child that made me realize how dysfunctional and abusive they are. They couldn't even respect my right to parent my own child. I tried and tried and they forced me to cut off contact. My brother is just as bad as they are. So I haven't seen any of them in 2 years and my life is SO much better for it. My MIL is an amazing woman and my husband is super supportive and unconditional. It was the right choice to walk away from my abusers. They never gave me basic human rights or unconditional love. I have a chance to give that to my child in a way I never had. They've even done horrible things towards my kid. So I have to protect us. \n----\n\nIdk maybe I reacted too strongly but I hate when people say they'll pray for me-especially to reconcile with my nparents. That just seems shitty. Let me go up to a battered wife and say \"I'll pray for you and your husband to work it out because I know him\". That's fucked up. \n\nSo maybe I didn't over react. ",

So, thank you for everyone who supported me on my last post.  It was very, very helpful.\n\nI sent an email to the director of the school stating that we'd like to enroll my son.  A week goes by.  I got no reply.  I knew the director had some personal stuff going on and there was the holiday, so I tried not to assume the worst... but it was hard.  \n\nI decided that I needed to call, but I found myself dreading what I call \"the talk.\"  \"The talk\" is the response I got through my whole damn childhood whenever I tried to tell anyone about the crazy stuff that was going on at home.  It was what I got when I asked for help or support or any extra wiggle room, because my parents were insane.  \"The talk\" went like this, \"Listen kid, you seem to have way more \"problems\" than I can deal with.  Just get your head out of your ass and you'll be fine.  Stop trying to create drama.\"  Of course, this insinuated that I was a liar or very troubled and my parents were saints and whoever it was I was talking to wanted to steer clear of me.  \n\nI managed to get myself to call the school today and steeled myself for \"the talk.\"  \n\nIt was fine.  The director did have a personal thing happen and she was just then emailing me some of the information I needed.  An hour later, I was in the school's office paying the registration fee and deposit on tuition.  It looks very much like my son will be attending that school.  Yay!\n\nNo dreaded \"talk\"... no judging me for being crazy because I have a restraining order against my father and my son has food allergies.  No drama.  Just paperwork.  The director has also given me my son's teacher's email address, so we can discuss how to deal with his allergies in class since a snack will be served.  \n\nIt went okay.  Phew.  \n\nI cannot tell you what a relief it is that my supposed \"craziness\" isn't keeping my son going to preschool.  \n\nThank you all for your support.  It helped me so much through the panic around that preschool tour.  You are awesome and I am so thankful for this group.  Thank you.\n\n",

Long history of verbal abuse, gaslighting, etc. I sent an NC letter detailing reasons why I cut off family, and I asked for space. I let him know that it could be 5-10 years before I was ready to see family again.  \n\nYou know what today's damn email said? \n\nHe said he desperately wanted to see me and he had no idea what I was up to. He begged for information about me. He then explained that his office got a new CEO and he wanted to share his thanksgiving message with me because he was afraid his last link to me was lost. I think he means my email address? Well it does work and it's unfortunate. \n\nThe email launched into a nationalistic, Rush Limbaugh-esque rant about America, the evils of the millenial generation (my generation!!!), the Nazis and Hitler, and what it means to be a true american. It was bizarre. I don't quite understand what it has to do with me, but it feels like he's still shoving his faith and his beliefs down my throat yet again. What else is new?\n\nI swing back and forth between being angry and laughing at the absurdity of it. If I walk a mile in his shoes and imagine desperately wanting to talk to somebody who cut me off, I would choose my words carefully. \n\nIt reminds me that I am NC for a reason. I choose to be around people who respect me and treat me like a human being with separate emotions. He isn't capable of the kind of love or support I imagine or daydream about, especially in the times when I feel guilty for NC. \n\nJust needed to say UGH. thanks for letting me vent about it a little bit.

It wasn't long ago that I said to someone. \"Both my parents never gave a shit. I can survive anything now\". \n\n\nAs I kept reading and watching videos and thinking about the past, the comment about toughness was kept on me.

Man, world is \"a very mean and nasty place, and I don't care how tough you are, it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it.\" (BALBOA, Rocky). I red somewhere that some ancient armies would cry immediately after a battle was won, for the dead soldier. The reason for that was to make soldiers unstoppable even when seeing their brothers in arms dying. They know there will be time for mourning, so for now, kick your enemies ass. \n\n\nI'm experiencing a similar feeling. I was thinking about all those years relentlessly running after my goals, tying knots on smoke. I cried a little.\n\n\nI still prefer to not have a \"poor me\" atitude (too late?). I don't expect, nor even want, someone pitying me and raising his hand. I don't expect charity, favors, solidarity, compassion. World is tough and I'm hard as a motherfucker. Thanks, parents, and point taken. It is just that in the end, as a human being, there is only so much I can take(well, at least without affecting my overall health).",

He isn't so cuddly and he doesn't always say romantic things, but he shows his love for me in many little gestures such as cooking nice meals, organizing the house, downloading a show that I want to watch, etc. All the time he is thinking, \"what can I do that will make her life a little bit nicer?\" It's so wonderful and sometimes I feel bad because my brain doesn't naturally go there. \n\nWe've been really good lately and we are both happy, but I want to get better at doing this for him so I can make him feel even more loved... but I'm so bad at Acts of Service! There are a lot of fleas around it, because chores and favours for other people in my household were associated with obligation, guilt, control, etc. \n\nI'm good at physical touch and words of affirmation, but those aren't his love language and they won't be as meaningful to him as this would be.

We can to one part in the \"story\" where we were supposed to interview someone who had been \"kidnapped\" (not a player.) One person in the group shouted out \"I hope he's been raped because then he'll be more cooperative!\" One guy in the group was like \"woaaah!\" (in a negative way) The first guy then responded to this by saying, \"What? He'll have PTSD! It'll be way easier!\"\n\nPeople in the group pretty much ignored him, besides the guy who initially responded with the \"woah\" reactions. I didn't want to egg him on, or give him any attention for what he said, because, as I've learned from my N-family, such \"shock\" behavior is usually primarily attention-seeking, and the \"woah\" from the first guy seemed to just encourage him, even though it was clearly a negative reaction in tone.\n\nHonestly, I'm not really comfortable playing games with this guy again. He didn't seem to understand how inappropriate what he said was, and he made other inappropriate comments throughout the evening that belittled sexual trauma. He joked about one female character (again, not a player) by saying, \"I'll seduce her and then kill her!\"\n\nI don't want to avoid the whole group, which is around 200 people, just because of one guy, and I don't think I'll stop going to events, but I seriously don't want to play with this dude anymore. I'm also one of very few women, so any sort of joke like this makes me feel like everyone's staring at me to see my reaction, and, honestly, they probably are.\n\nI felt like I was, in a sense, part of the problem, because I tried to just ignore him, but I don't really go to these games because I want to explain to men that most women (and many men) don't appreciate jokes that belittle the trauma of sexual violence. There is a person \"in charge\" of each game, usually someone more experienced who understands the group and its overall goals for the community. Maybe he did get warnings, I don't know, but it was completely out of sight if he did.\n\nAnyway, I don't know if I'm just ranting or venting or what, but I was pretty shocked to find this in a group that's typically pretty chilled out, and I haven't really associated with this kind of toxic behavior. It's pretty clear, though, that behavior like that can easily run unchecked in this group, and it's making me think about looking into other options for my gaming nights.",

So I did that. \n\nI maintained LC up until about a year and a half ago when my boyfriend and I found our first apartment together but it was a little out of our price range, so my boyfriend's mom spoke with my mom's boyfriend and HE ends up agreeing to help pay for it and ever since my nmom has been treating me the way she would treat outsiders when I was younger. \n\nFor example, on thanksgiving she sent me a message saying she was proud of me and that she knew I was working but that I was welcome over any time if I got the chance. In the past she wouldn't have mentioned anything about being proud, and would have tried guilt tripping me to come over on one of my breaks instead of giving me the choice. My phone ended up dying part way through my shift and so I just came over unannounced and instead of her getting angry the way she would have in the past she hugged me warmly and led me to the table where she still had a plate set out for me even though everyone had already eaten. Like it felt as though she was a normal loving mom. I can't tell if its partially because I was the GC growing up or if its just because I'm out of the house and don't see her all the time so she puts up her mask when she's around me but it's really freaking me out. It legitimately feels more like its just another form of gaslighting than anything. \n\nI know she hasn't gotten better because she still torments my SGbrother, who still lives with her, and I still try to refrain from talking to her especially about any fears/insecurities/hopes/dreams I have because I know she'll use them against me if her temper goes at any time. But I just don't know how to feel about this.\n\nPlus on top of this my dad who I thought was my one example of a healthy adult growing up is starting to act like a narcissist and he DID send me a nasty text on thanksgiving which ended up making my cry. So I'm just really really confused, basically and  I'm wondering if anyone else has had an experience like this? ",

Why bother?\n\nI'm late 30s/M.  Alone. Something about me just prevents women from taking a liking to me. I'm in great shape, I've got a good job, I've got fun hobbies (I'm a dancer), I'm assured I'm not an asshole... but nothing I've ever said or done has ever changed things. I'm coming up on twelve years since the last time I was in a relationship. Of course it must be something I do, but I don't know what. \n\nI don't have any family at all. It's just me. I'm going to die this way. I just want someone to love me and let me love them. It's a perfectly understandable human desire. I've turned down sex because I've known there was no emotional attachment involved on either side, and that wasn't what I wanted. So... no intimacy, no romance, not even any physical release.\n\nA close friend was kind enough to invite me along to her family's thanksgiving dinner, this year. I was honored, but it reminded me too much of all the things I don't have, and the things which feel like the bare minimum that I need. I feel like I am coming apart.\n\nNDad is a verbally abusive monster who regularly encouraged me to kill myself. NMom is an emotionally manipulative demon who cares only about herself. She made a failed attempt to reconnect with me by email several months ago by asking me who screwed me up so badly. She did nothing but blame things on other people, including myself. GCSis... I don't even know. I don't want to know. She takes after her parents, especially her mother.\n\nReconnecting with either of them would be a terrible idea. I don't think they even know where I am. But I'm in so much pain right now, I'm not sure what to do. Alcohol doesn't even provide temporary relief. I'm a grown man, and I'm sitting here in my apartment, sobbing.\n\nBesides all that, I keep wondering what's going to happen when they're dead. It's irrational. I shouldn't care. But I do care. I feel like they deserve to see who I am, see how I've grown, see what I look like, know that I'm doing well for myself. At the same time, I know I'm projecting something onto a paper wall. They won't care. They don't care. And yet, because they are alive (AFAIK), there is some silly potential that they COULD care. When they die, it's gone. And I am petrified of the feelings of regret I will have once that happens. This... all of it, just boils down to wanting to be loved and wanting to love somebody.\n\nI don't know if I'm asking for help or ranting. I'm sorry. I don't even know what I'm typing this out for.

Jobs at the level I'm at don't really exist anymore since the economy has changed so fast.\n\nHave any of you been able to make it out and get their career going in their 30s after recovering from this stuff?

        "text": "I was evicted from home at 23 (I am 35 now). I know. It is enough to be paid enough to live by my own. We can discuss the loser I was/am on another moment.\n\nHer current husband (which, ironically, I keep contact to this day) came in when I was alone at home. He had a message from her. She asked me to leave. Our fights were becoming unbearable (I agree). \"I'm sorry to say that. Will you need any help?\". I asked for a month and left.\n\nFast forward to 7 years. I am 30. Everything was not that bad. I haven't graduated, but job wasn't a problem and kinda could choose where to work (and that was kind the exact reason I dropped college), and living in a not so bad area of the city (could not say the same about the building). I was having lunch with her husband. He talk about me leaving home and how do I look much better now (interesting how many people was saying that just a few months after I was living alone). He lets something slip. He says her decision was reasonable, cause if not, I could end up attacking her with a knife or something.\n\nW.\n\nT.\n\nF???\n\n\nI ask for clarification, but I already now what I am about to hear. She was worried that I was becoming more and more upset about her moving on my things in my room. \"With so many things to say about me, she end up with one that has zero base on reality, and you believed, huh?\". And he goes on rationalizing, saying that people can just become angry and something bad. I can't remember how many times I was saying the portuguese equivalent of \"bullshit\". I wasn't angry. I was sad. Terribly sad. I went silent. We paid our meal, he wished me luck on my new job, I said thanks and went on my way. He later wrote me, saying that he might feel that he said a few things that shouldn't, but I never was mad of him.\n\n\nWhat made me most sad on this was how absurd it was. I was the victim of violence from her. I was hit with a stick when I was entering in the bath while she was screaming with me at 11. At 14 I had long hair, and she pulled it from behind when I turned my back to her during another discussion. She used to say that she was going to cut it when I was sleeping. She also said \"You are gonna regret if something happens to my mother\". My sin? Visit grandma on business days without announcing.\n\n\nFast forward a few more years, until last year. I am 34, living in another city. I go visit him with my current beautiful girlfriend. We are going to say on his apartment during a long holyday, while they go on a trip. She is there. While I talk to him, my girl is with her in another room.\n\n\nAs if the irony of my greatest savior in my life being the husband of my mother with whom I have zero contact, here comes more: my girl loved her. She talked to me how she told her that she never hit me-\n\n\n*sigh*\n\n\nReally? So, after 15 years with no contact with this woman, among so many things she has to talk in less than one hour, she chooses a lie. That lie. She even told it deliberatly. My girl didn't even ask about it! Yeah, this time I was furious. Se believed her, rationalized that it wasn't that bad, she was mother, blablabla.\n\n\nTo this day, many, if not all my family, don't know or do not believe that she evitcted me or ever hit me. They say about how I am being crazy again for saying that, how as I always ways. Yeah, of course I was. She was screaming on me for an open toothpaste for christ sake! It is funny how peaceful people consider me to this day, \"a zen master\". Sometimes I am affraid what that snake might be whispering on everyone else ears about me. She had the audacity to lie about violence in less than one hour when talking with someone that her met for the first time, on a topic that she wasn't even asked for. She didn't even have to bring it. And she did.\n\n\nAnyway, she is just a con artist that I don't need to have contact anymore. I am not looking for responsibles, but trying to understand the context of my life so I can better understand myself. I also believe sharing helps to heal, so, thanks for reading that. Maybe in another moment I can tell about my father.\n\nEDIT: eh. I'm confused with why this is being downvoted. ",

        "text": "When I first came here a couple of weeks ago, I saw where someone wrote that she already hated her mother at the age of five, and I had such a strong feeling of \"I wish *I'd* known enough to hate my mother at five!\" And so I wonder how it went for you all.\n\nI was very isolated and didn't see how other families were other than going with my mother to her friends' houses and seeing how they interacted in front of company. I of course knew that how you act in company doesn't mean much (which is part of why I had very negative feelings about being social when I was growing up. I associated it with having to be fake.) If I was ever anywhere, my mother was right there to judge me, so I couldn't enjoy myself and relax. She happily told me once how her friend told her \"You look at him like you want to kill him!\" As usual, her thought on it was \"It works!\" She called her angry glare \"The Look\". You will be *amazed* to hear that I don't make good eye contact or look at people and notice their body language. I look in another direction. It does me a lot of good socially.\n\nSo she was constantly like \"I do *so* much more for you than any other mother would!\", and I'd have no idea what to think when maybe other mothers were all worse somehow.\n\nWhen I was maybe ten, I came home and told my parents that I was being bullied, not that there was anything that could've been done about it. One of them said \"Maybe you did something wrong to make him mad at you. Did you ever think of that?\", and that was all. I walked away a little shocked because I hadn't fully grasped until then that they weren't on my side and I was alone.\n\n(As an aside: All of this stuff is so multiplicative. That bullying was in a sense not very severe, but after some weeks of it not affecting me too strongly, I took to spending all day at school thinking about the bully and hiding when necessary--hiding every lunchtime--terrified of assemblies, worried when watching television and seeing fighting and thinking the bully might be getting ideas from it. Terrified because my home life had sensitized me or left me without resilience or any reserve of anything. After...three and a half years, he moved away.)\n\nOnly knowing kids during school and having no home friends, I didn't really know anyone closely enough to talk about deep things, and didn't know how to go about it. Although, that said, my recollection is that boys in my school just didn't ever talk about anything deep or private or anything that you would think of a conversation among close friends, not even in high school.\n\nBut one time when I was about twelve and I was feeling distressed about my mother and the awfulness, I tried to ask one boy, \"...Is your mother nice?\" He said, \"I don't know.\" And then, having no idea how to bring the conversation in the right direction of finding out what other families are like and how other children felt about their home lives, I just said \"Mine is\" from a mix of uncertainty and feeling it was perhaps inadvisable to say anything that could get back to her somehow. I feel sad to think that I said that, even though I understand why and all.\n\nWhen I was more like fifteen, I felt thoroughly disgusted by her. Maybe this was because I had a step-father by then and we could commiserate.\n\nBut it wasn't until university that I could tell the others and see their shock, to be advised \"after you graduate, move away and don't tell her where\" (which I still took somewhat jokingly at the time). A time when I saw how my roommate's mother did a lot for her son and it was hard to decide whether it was too much or what's normal and healthy.",

I'd ask her why she'd just do that instead of taking the whole thing, which of course led to gaslighting and claiming ownership over my food. At the time I didn't realize she was doing this for N-fuel to get a reaction in order to punish me, but to this day I am still grossed out by it. From what I understand, her taste is still highly unrefined- I was told she ordered a giant cinnamon roll on her birthday... for lunch. \n\nIt took me a long time to figure out HOW to cook and support myself in a healthy manner.

That's great.  \n\nI really didn't think it would be that hard to tell them that I have a restraining order against my father and that I have concerns that my n-father may try to swipe my kid.  But, I freaked.  I am very open about it with my friends and, obviously, anonymously online.  But, talking about it to a stranger from whom I am asking something (please allow my child to enroll in your school) and apparently I panic.  I didn't know I'd react like this.\n\nI felt like a crazy person making things up to be dramatic or a crazy person who has alienated her poor, innocent father.  I felt sick.  After it was over, I felt like I was going collapse... like literally faint.  It happened an hour ago and I still feel very, very shaken.  I feel judged.  I fear this woman won't let my son go to this school, because his mother is a crazy person.  I fear no school with accept my son, because his mother is insane.  \n\nEven more than that, I'm afraid my father will show up at the school and kidnap my son.  So I told them. I wanted them to know upfront, so they could respond if they can't deal with this kind of situation.  Combine that with my son's deadly food allergies and I feel like we are an unreasonable \"dramatic\" household or something.  \n\nMy PTSD is definitely set-off.  Suddenly, I feel very unsafe.  Every noise is startling me.  Everything feels like danger.  I am not a happy camper.  \n\nUnfortunately, I have a few hours before my kids will nap and I can do anything to take care of myself.  Until then, I will be white knuckling not bursting into tears, because my son dropped a toy and it made a noise.  \n\nFuck my parents for wounding me in such a way that I am still feeling the effects decades later.  Fuck those people.\n\nI know theoretically that I did the right thing by telling the preschool about this stuff... but I FEEL like a criminal and a crazy person.  I feel sick.  Ugh.  I hate this.\n",

She bought me some kind of antiperspirant. If anything, it seemed to make me sweat more. And put nice glop in my shirts. She still complained that I smelled horrible constantly, and accused me of not using it. (Actually, this touches on a common pattern for us. I'd say that I did use it. She'd say that she used whatever deodorant and didn't sweat. Her experience on anything was the final word on my experience.) I'd feel defeated because there wasn't a non-humiliating way to prove antiperspirant application.\n\nI started to get pimples. Not unusually bad ones. All my fault. \"You don't wash good.\" Because she apparently had never gotten much in the way of pimples. Sometimes she'd hold me down and squeeze them. And pick at blackheads in my ears with a needle. Berating me the whole time.\n\nWhen I was about sixteen, she realized that I could lift heavier objects than she could. She was pretty upset because she was *defined* as a hard worker and I was *defined* as lazy. She wasn't a manual laborer or anything.\n\nWhen I began to grow hair on my face, it was another very-not-talked-about topic. Avoided and uncomfortable. Let's carefully never talk about razors and how to shave or any of that. Once, though, she decided that I had to go with her to the picnic at her job in order to show me off in some way. Put on nicer clothes, no doubt selected by her, let her cut my hair. And the facial hairs, so sparse and individually kept short with scissors in private, she got really worked up about how much of an embarrassment I would be to her, and she forced me into the bathroom with...it might've been her leg razor, I'm not sure now. It was humiliating in general, and humiliating because she was having a freak-out about a normally taboo topic.\n\n(Ha! Embarrassment! What percent of the time when we were driving home from visiting one of her friends did she immediately start in on how I embarrassed her so badly?)\n\nI see I've forgotten most of my examples now over the years. That's all right.\n\nThe final one occurred when I was moving into my own apartment in a fourplex when I was starting work. She saw that a woman lived in the next apartment over. She commented that I'd have to shovel that woman's bit of walking path. \"Why?\" (I said because I grew up on messages of equality from the media.) \"Because...you're the... man.\" And I wish I could express how much confusion and unhappiness went into the word \"man\".\n\nShe sometimes liked to think that girls were watching me with interest when we went to stores, though, when I was a teenager. I'm not sure how to reconcile this with what I've written above. I thought this was unlikely because I was wearing kmart clothes that she'd selected, I had bad hair, thick glasses, looked younger than I was, and was following my mother around like an unhappy duckling, looking mostly at the floor.\n\nMaybe there was something about...when it was just her and me, I was plain awful in all the ways that I refused to remain that little four-year-old boy who could be abused and not realize he deserved better, but when it was about others seeing me, then she wanted to show me off, wanted me to look good, wanted to think that I could impress others, in order to take credit for me. Well, I ranged far off topic from my question in my rambling. Sorry!",

If I have a drink, I'm fine until the next day, but, if I don't have one, the cravings continue all day long.\n\nIs there anyone here that can relate to this?

A draft report is due on Nov 27 and the final report and presentation are due Dec. 3.  Too close for comfort.  \n\nThis is what I'm considering sending to my professor either tomorrow or Tuesday.  I have evidence to back up my claims about my work being ignored etc.  What are your thoughts?  I can get SO riled up about this.\n\n----\n\nThere is a problem in my group and I'm not sure what to do about it.\n\nFrom my point of view, it seems that I am being shut out of the project.  My work has been largely excluded and ignored, as have many of my ideas, questions and concerns about the project.  I haven't had a reply to my most recent email to the group (sent on Thursday) and no new work has been uploaded to our shared drive, so I don't know the current status of the project.  Unfortunately, the interpersonal dynamics have deteriorated so much that I doubt a group discussion will resolve the issue, at least not without mediation.\n\nAt this point my main concern is fulfilling the requirements of the course, and I would like your input about that.",

        "text": "I'm in my late 30s, and through an intensive 5 years of therapy in my early 30s realized that a lot of issues I was having stemmed from having a Narcissistic Family - actually, both NMom and NDad. It really took a lot of therapy to understand the depths of the abuse I went through as a child (and even young adult). At first, I thought \"it wasn't so bad\" or \"others had it worse\" or \"but this is just sort of normal\", but had to eventually conclude that my abuse was actually incredibly horrific. Admitting that to myself, much less others, and going NC - an entire new idea of the world opened up. \n\nI've read lots of books (Drama of the Gifted Child, Toxic Parents, Mothers Who Can't Love, stuff like that) and followed RBN and LAN for a while - and they've helped greatly. Everything makes so much more sense, and I feel so relieved to understand things differently!\n\nWhile I've always been pretty successful professionally, going NC with my family and the work with my previous therapist (which ended 4 years ago) helped me to become more of a \"real person\" instead of the hyper-successful automaton that I'd been previously. \n\nAn odd tradeoff that has happened is that I'm not really as good at being driven and successful anymore. I've had some slumps and a few professional losses (rightfully losing out on a promotion that many believed would be mine, although I understand now that my work really was not as good as before). Slowly - so slowly I didn't realize it was happening, and neither did anyone in my life - I stopped being as social as before, and one day I realized I had become hermit-ish.\n\nAfter sort of waking up and realizing that perhaps I'd been in a depression for the past two years, I went to my primary care doctor and talked to her about it - she was great, but didn't feel qualified to talk to me about depression and referred me to a therapist who works with the practice. I've seen her once a month since June, and we've gone through a lot of my history and current issues. She's really well-versed in childhood abuse and Ns, so I trust her judgement a lot.\n\nTwo weeks ago, we talked again about the reason for my referral to her, and she told me that if she thought I was in clinical depression she'd refer me to the psychiatrist for anti-depressants, but she didn't feel that was right for me at this time. We went over DSM criteria for depression together, and she involved me in the discussion, which was new to me and cool. It's true, I don't really \"fit\" depression stuff. \n\nAlthough I have concerns about avoidant behavior and procrastination and stuff, we've talked through some of the triggers and she's been helpful in helping me realize the common denominator is that I'm avoiding conflict - especially sticking up for myself or anything that involves my own boundaries or asserting my worth. It was absolutely an \"ah-ha!\" moment for me, but makes me sad that after all this recovery and growth and understanding for some reason I feel like I'm backsliding. Letting a lot of the past trauma that I thought I'd processed creep back into my life hurts - I want to work through it and don't really understand why now, after all this time and effort, I'm kind of having a delayed reaction.\n\nYesterday I had a realization that led to some googling and I found the terms \"disassociation\" and \"emotional numbing\", and it resonated with me for the first time! Oh! This is why I sort of might feel like/look like I'm in a depression, when I don't really \"fit\" that!\n\nI won't see my therapist for 2 more weeks, but am interested in talking about this with her and/or looking into it more. LAN, can you help me?\n\nHave any of you done reading on this, or worked on it yourself? If so, how did you come to that realization? What was your trigger or how did your disassociation/emotional numbing manifest?\n\nDo you have experiences you can share, authors you like, or just more google terms that might help me read more? Right now, I've googled [c-ptsd disassociation emotional numbing](https://www.google.com/#q=c-ptsd+dissociation+emotional+numbing) and come up with lots, although there's a lot to read on and I'm not exactly sure if this is 100% correct.

I expect you not to contact me via phone, letter, social media or any other way. I will decide whether or not to resume contact with you  in January, 2017.

Isn't it funny how I just noticed that \"my family respects my boundaries and doesn't harass me\" is not a scenario I have planned for.\n\nI also want to send an email to the 3 people I think they are most likely to try to use against me. They all know how my family can be, and only 1 of them talks to my family anymore, but I don't want them to get blindsided my my family's bullshit (pardon my Klatchian.) \n\nAny suggestions for the NC letter or the Heads-up letter or really anything in general is welcome.",

Clear-thinking adults who have no or little experience of neglect and abuse probably still put their own on a pedestal, and cannot fully let go of this. \n\n&gt; Everything in society cements the idea that parents, and particularly mothers, love their children always, deeply, no matter what, and that all you need is a little heart-to-heart to put it right when the relationship has been tough. Of course, the reality is much uglier, and there are parents out there who are no good for their children. Whether they love them or not is besides the point; they are poison.\n\n&gt; I feel such empathy for what you are going through right now. It's extremely difficult to flip something like this on its head, see your parents for what they are and not what you wish they were, and come to terms with the fact that your relationship with them cannot be rescued.",

Let me know if you have any concerns or if something doesn't make sense:\n\n1) If you haven't already, please take a look at Client Contact's comments on the report. Most of them are just minor comments that we can make changes to in the final report (All)\n\n2) Look into [literature recommended by Professor] (Project Manager)\n\n3) Reformat research questions (Other Group Member)\n\n4) Expand data section (Candleflame3)\n\n5) Reorganize methodology section (Candleflame3 and Project Manager)\n\n6) Rerun stats  (Project Manager) \n\n7) Write analysis section (All) \n\nThere are some minor suggestions that Professor mentioned in the report that we can take a look at together. Our goal is to have the report finalized and sent to Client Contact by Friday November 27th so that if she has any questions, we have time to make the appropriate edits. Does this sound good?\n\nAre you both available to work together in the lab on Tuesday Nov 24th and Wednesday Nov 25th from 12pm-4pm? \n\n\n-Project Manager  \n\nThis is what I plan to send in reply, but I can’t tell if it’s too bitchy.  I FEEL bitchy about this whole thing.\n\n\nHello\n\nA few things come to mind:\n\n1) I must mark over 100 essays from Nov 20 to Dec 3, so I can't spare big chunks of unstructured time.  At this stage, I think most of the work on this report can be done via Dropbox and email anyway.  We can meet to go over the final draft before class on Thursday Nov. 26.\n\n2) Please spell out exactly what you expect for \"expand the data section\".\n\n3) Re: methods, I'm not really in a position to write this as I don't really know what has been happening with the methods, e.g. why at this point the stats need to be re-run, if they were done properly for the progress report.  Since Project Manager is doing the stats, and presumably keeping track of her methods and her rationale, she is best suited to writing this.\n\n4) It sounds like the decision has been made not to do [other stats methods desired by client] or any visualizations.  Is that right?\n\n5) When will the results of the stats be available so that analysis can begin?   The more lead time, the better.\n\nCheers\n\nCandleflame3\n\nWhat do you all think?\n",

During the call he made a couple of judgmental statements about my NC, but more from a place of ignorance than malice.\n\nThinking about this, I realized that he didn't go through recovery, so he lacks the related subjectiveness, empathy, awareness of differing value systems/family dynamics, and how completely different it is to be raised by abusive parents as opposed to loving parents. I also feel a person raised by abusive parents who has not been through recovery would be the same.\n\nI'm not interested in talking about my upbringing, defending any of my actions toward my immediate family, or having any of my old childhood circuitry triggered, so I'm not into explaining my NC decision to anybody for any reason. All that is old business that I've talked out in therapy enough times. I've moved on from it.\n\nI'm thinking it would be best to broaden my NC to include any extended family members of either type. Unrecovered adult children of abusive families are likely to shame me for not being in contact with my immediate family, and adults from healthy families would not understand it at all.\n\nWhat's your experience?",

He was upset, but trying to be professional; when I questioned if I was just too sensitive or crazy, he knew when to reaffirm me and when to draw me back to things that were vulnerable for me, without making me feel too broken.\n\nAnd he told me that he thought it was bullshit the people I encountered that let me down, that he is sorry that I went through that, but that he is proud and impressed that I am coming in swinging to deal with these issues.\n\nWhen I confessed I was scared he'd turn me away because it was too much, or that I would be \"too dependent\", he kicked those thoughts to the curbs and told me that his clinic is flexible, that he wouldn't abandon me because I have a lot of problems, and that he felt comfortable expressing this thoughts to me and I should, if I was comfortable, feel the same.\n\nI feel like a weight isn't off my shoulders per say, but I have a person on my team me who can help me carry it right now.\n\nI hope it's ok to post this update here; hearing your experiences, your approaches to therapy, your interactions, really helped.\n\nEspecially because i'm sort of \"hesitant to share/vulnerable\" then quickly \"That's it, I'm taking out these skeletons and I am *dealing* with them *right now*\", so it's hard to just go in with one approach.\n\nSmall things I have learned; it's nice having a therapist who understands being a social worker/psych major that I don't need certain things broken down too much, so we can speed through some descriptors.\n\nHe made it clear if there was an issue with payments, he'd help me figure something out (there wasn't but it was good to know).\n\nHe is good enough at reading the situation to allow extra time for a client if needed, but still good at wrapping things up (a plus I hadn't considered).\n\nHe doesn't make me feel uncomfortable or guilty for sharing; I didn't realize I'd had people in the past who did this but it was good to realize.\n\nHe is close enough to my age to understand modern issues that I may deal with re: my experiences in the health profession (37 vs my 26) but not so old as to be confused by social media and stuff like that.\n\nLastly, as someone who is very anxious and also trying to go in to stamp out my problems, he is good at coaxing me to say things I'm nervous about but also letting me know that I set the boundaries, and he will never force me to examine something that makes me so uncomfortable that I am reliving the initial anxiety. This is something I only struggled with once; because i am so keen on dealing with my issues, I would end up going through things from my past but in such a state that I'd be reliving the panic but couldn't progress with it.\n\nThank you all so much; I am so glad that I live in an era where I can reach out to people all over, people who are ACoNs or persons who have also been trying to grow as adults and be whole and healthy, from a variety of life places.  You are all so inspiring, as cheesy as that may sound, and I feel like I have a secret Team Me whenever I'm on these boards.",

I'm working on it.\n\nWhat I wanted to reach out about was the engulfing sensation that I will die at any moment. My mother was both tactical and manic in her attacks. Sometimes they just happened. Other times they were meticulously planned in advance. But of the two styles, I have always had a nauseating anticipation that I will die at literally any moment. She hit me unexpectedly, usually in the back of the head when I couldn't see it coming. Some of these blows were bad enough that I lost sight for a moment and others gave me excruciating headaches that lasted days. What a metaphor for the future. She also cut me off important resources periodically including food, towels, sanitary pads/tampons, and money in general. I was always at her whim.\n\nIt doesn't make any sense as I'm out of the house and on my own. I recently graduated college and have lived overseas. I am, for a millennial anyways, extremely self reliant and have always approached my goals with relentless and unyielding efforts. The problem is that I simply don't see past 30 or so. It doesn't seem real. I adore my friends who have started families. A part of me would love to be a good mom. But also on relationships. I would love to have a relationship but it doesn't seem like a real thing. It just doesn't. \n\nI adore these things but my mind can't reach that far. It's sort of like-- blurred. That's the only way I can describe it.\n\nSo the question is: how can I make a life vision and plan for my goals if I think I'm going to die?\n\nIf anybody has further reading on this phenomenon please post below.",

        "text": "Hi forum,\n\nI thought about cross-posting this to RBN, but I'm not sure; the last time I posted there for help I got very little feedback. \n\nI think my problem is quite general to a lot of people, but probably people on this forum can most relate to this issue, and why I specifically have developed this issue.\n\nFor the last year, since I have been in recovery from my trauma, I have not been doing much in my life. Hardly anything at all, really.  At first I was, but then I stopped, because I became so sick of the way that I used to berate myself into action and use self-criticism to motivate me to do things.\n\nI spent my twenties up until the age of 31, last year, being really busy all the time: work and/or school, social life, volunteer opportunities, side-projects, whatever else. I used to fill my day with tons of stuff.  That began to ebb away into my early thirties, partially due to addiction issues getting more severe.\n\nI used to tell myself: \"Get up, you have to go for a run, or else you are lazy and will become fat and gross.\" and \"Go ahead, now, you have to take this job. Sure, the job sucks and you hate it, but it earns you good money, and you need to look successful and have a good job and do the things other people do.\" and \"Make sure you have plans every night this week, otherwise you are a loser with no friends\" and \"You better do your side-projects, otherwise you are lazy and boring and dull.\"  And on and on like that. \n\nSo I got sober last year, and I started doing all the things again, but then I had so much self-applied pressure: \"You better succeed at this and do that and do this, or you are lazy and stupid and boring\" and I just caved under all of that negativity. \n\nNow it's been a full year that I have not been doing much of anything. For a solid year, I have been doing therapy three times a week, plus group therapy, plus talking to a small number of friends.  But I have yet to get a job (I don't need one financially yet, so that part is ok) and while I am ok with not having a job, the point of not working right now was *supposed to be* for me to start on the things I have wanted to start on for - 5 years.\n\nFor the last 5 years, I have harbored a desire to travel more, study languages, learn an instrument, write more, and paint more, and run outside daily or weekly.  But I have done exactly none of these things at all, to no degree at all.\n\nIt's because I am really worried about how miserable it will be to do these things. I spent 5 years telling myself \"No, you need a stable career job that gives you lots of money, and you need to learn to like it, and you need to work on your relationship with your parents, and you need to get stable home life, buy house, have the same friends for years like other people do, and win awards and be the good daughter and successful person you are supposed to be, or else you are lazy and stupid and boring and undisciplined.\"\n\nWhen I started doing my life how I wanted a bit over a year ago, the same voices came right back and started saying: \"Hurry up, get successful, achieve something, you are taking too long, that's not good enough, this isn't good enough.\" And I quit after two months of this, because fuck it, I have harbored these dreams of doing these things for so long, but they just make me miserable and sad and hate myself even more. There is no point to doing the life I want to do if I'm just going to hate and suffer my whole way through it!  The inner critic won't shut up, it keeps screaming at me, and it is making me miserable doing the things I know I would enjoy, could enjoy, doing, hypothetically.\n\nI took a break from all of life for an entire 13 months now. I have been isolating, and not going out to meet new people. I don't like most of my old \"friends\" and have no desire to talk to most of them anymore.  I don't want to find work right now, because I hypothetically want to do these other interests in the meantime.  I won't paint, or write, or learn an instrument, or study languages, or run, or travel.  I just won't do any of these goals that I had as dreams for so long. I'm scared of hating myself when I fail, of being angry at myself if I don't do something perfectly, of suffering my way through what should be enjoyable.\n\nI've been working on recovery and silencing the inner critic, developing self-esteem, re-learning how to talk to myself, etc….But I'm too scared to try these things, because as long as I don't do them I won't know how miserable I could be doing these things and hating myself for my mistakes and shortcomings.  \n\nI feel really trapped. On the one hand, it has been a full 13 months of not doing anything; I think I've given myself a fair break and taken personal time for myself.  I think I can't wait forever, and it won't help to wait and wait and wait until I'm \"all better!\" or dead.  But I also feel so scared to start on these things.  These are really big dreams I had for so long, and I think I may crumple before I even get anywhere under the weight of my self-hatred and self-criticism and self-applied pressure.  These things will take years to really become good at it, and even longer to really be able to make a living off of them (writing, painting, things that few people ever successfully do, ever, even under the best of circumstances.)  \n\nI'm too scared to try and fail and then hate myself as a result, and yet I don't think it's helpful any longer to keep putting it off and waiting.  It's been over a year since I've done anything, even something little, and I just feel trapped even though technically I'm not, except I am, in my own head.  \n\nHelp?",

        "text": "Hello LAN\n\nBig gratitude to everyone who gave their opinions on my post about work issues. I didn't reply to everyone, I usually try to, but I was extremely dissociated the past couple weeks so it didn't happen. But thank you I really found everyone's thoughts and ideas useful.\n\nAnyway, so the update on my work issue is that the head of my team met with me (literally first thing I did in the meeting was cry. Aargh! Soooo frustrating. I psyched myself up so hard to NOT CRY. Argh.) But then I kind of managed to have a proper conversation with her. She was very fair, took on board what I said, agreed with much of what I said, and said she would talk with my managers about some of the problems I've had. She agreed with me that some things they are doing need to change, which she will raise with them. We also talked about how essentially I'm a quiet thinker, but my managers both think out loud and make snap decisions. And it is hard for me to get clear answers from them in meetings - they'll go off on a tangent and by the time I realize they didn't answer my question, the meeting has ended! She said she'll have a think about some tools and strategies I can learn to manage my managers when we have this mismatch of working styles. \n\nThis woman is a total f*\"king legend. Was so nervous about talking to her, but am really glad I worked up the courage and talked to her, even if I did cry!\n\nSo I was thinking in a sense what is going on here all relates to setting and policing boundaries.  I realized that, in some aspects of my life I have developed really clear boundaries and good strategies for policing them. But in some areas of my life - like work - I haven't got a clear picture of what my boundaries are, and most importantly I don't have practiced strategies in place for policing and maintaining my boundaries.\n\nI think in a way I was just so grateful to get this really quite good job (considering where I've come from) that I had the vague sense that I don't deserve to be there and therefore don't have the right to boundaries. (I'm sure some latent as yet unchallenged NMom training is at play in that thought process).\n\nSo anyway, the point of this post is to ask about other peoples experiences with boundaries at work. What are your boundaries at work? What strategies do you use to maintain your boundaries when people take the piss? \n\nI'm not good at thinking on my feet and forming an opinion in real-time. I think this comes from years of being gas-lit: I never trust my sense of reality until I've had some time to calmly think about a situation. But I would expect that in theory I could rehearse some assertive, empowered, non-abusive responses to a few of the more common boundary-pushing experiences in the workplace. I'm really interested to hear about others experiences of this sort of thing? \n\nTildr: what are your boundaries in the workplace? And what assertive strategies do you use to police and maintain your boundaries?  I'm looking for strategies I could rehearse and practice.",

Energy comes back to my soul - but that was just for two days, after that on Wed, I feel the same again - what's happening? Am I lacking inner energy? Or am I lacking social activities? \n\nI want to know your opinions. \n\nSecond, how can I make better friends in Canada, or say North America basically - I don't know if this is a North America thing or the post-abusive thing, I find asking questions a strange way to start a conversation. In my homeland, I have asked people \"What songs do you like.\"  And got a short rude answer, \"Good songs.\" And that's all it. This is why I hate my friends for a reason, they seem to have their awkward way of socializing but dismiss you just because you don't act like one of those fast-speaking, mind-reading people that pretend to be psychic all the time. And those pretending to be crazily sweet with you after just one day of \"day camp\" suddenly claims to be \"your best friend in the world\"? Stay away from me. \n\nSorry for being rant-ish here, it really makes me vomit. So back to the questions, what are some ways to make good friends in America? Basically I'd already know the dynamics here already, not too fast, keep patient, don't suddenly ask question out of nowhere, keep a calm, warm pace. But what's more? What are some questions should I ask? Should I learn more about pop culture since I am in college(but that is so time consuming)?\n\nGive me some suggestions, or some social site tips for the good. \n\nEdit - wording ",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterNarcissism/comments/3sdl8m/a_few_questions_about_punishments/",
        "text": "Part #1\n\nSo often times we may get punishments because of the action we do. First, I want to know, what is the real purpose of punishment? \nWhy should we punish ourselves, and when is it okay to do it?(Is it ever okay to do it?)\n\n\n\nGrowing up, we've all been punished unreasonably in some sense. Me as an example, I've been punished because my mother has been disappointed at me. Wether or not I tried my best, she will punish me because I haven't do what SHE wanted as the best. \n\n\n\nNow, very saddly, I have to ask this question - what is the difference between being disappointed by myself, and punishing myself? Sorry if this sounds a bit childish to ask, but I am inter-wined with the concept of disappointment and punishment - whenever I feel disappointed by myself, I will then punish myself. And it is even worse because I am a perfectionism, and now nearly I punish myself everyday. Needless to say, the perfectionism also stem from my ridiculous high standards of doing things from my Nmom that cannot be get rid of my mind easily. Therefore, I came here to seek help, how can I set apart both things? \n\n\n\nPlease, I'm asking for little advice, but with my purpose of talking my problems as well. I don't need a clear sharp advice yet, just you guys commenting will be fine as well, because I just wanted to get your response, but no mean comments please. \n\nPart #2 of my question\n \nShould I ever punish myself? Punish as making myself to do something humiliating, such as writing \"I am wrong for ten times\"(don't be shock, I was raised by some crazy-ass Asian-totalitarian-like parents that worship Mao, the nation's abuser) \n\nI assume the answer is no, and stemming from that, I want to know why \"productive punishments\" are a better choice?\n\n \"Productive punishments\" such as helping the dishes for one week, sweeping the floor for 10 times. Sorry my question is a bit confusing, what I really asking is why a productive punishment is more beneficial to the child. I've think of a lot of reason, such as cleaning as a mean of remedy, letting the children to learn some skills. Letting the children to understand they have to contribute back if they have done something wrong. \n\nBut I want more answers from here. I would like to see people here discuss, or comment.\n\nPart #3\n\nI want to stop making \"self-improvement\" as an excuse to punish myself. \n\nSelf-improvement should be something soothing, generous, heart-comforting, that when you do that, you will feel generously happy for your great effort.  But I was taught to make everything as a task, and if I don't achieve As in these tasks, I will be punished for \"lazy effort\", where lazy is just the scapegoat of the reason. \n\nNot only self-improvement but all other things, studying English, finding a job, socializing with people etc etc, everything in my life has became a task to conquer but not a process to enjoy. I remember I was a child, I wasn't like that, I can genuinely enjoy the process itself and care less about the results in a result-oriented manner. \n\nFor this, I have tried any thing I could, go walking, deep-breathing, punch a pillow, do exercise(walking basically), psychologically, I tried: focusing on the process, thinking what is around in the room, slowing down my thoughts, deduct my thoughts, meditate etc. However, I still seem to be very anxious, and overthinking my failure, and constant comparing myself with others.

I feel like I am seeing myself too high, that none of my progress are regarded as \"progress\", but are just a trash process that is sacrifice for the good. \n\nI feel I am perfect, but I can't proof my perfection. I am not perfect yet. \n\nI feel I am meant to be perfect, but I have yet to proof myself perfect. \n\nOk, I'm not saying I am perfect, but I suspect I am holding a serious perfectionism towrads myself, and I am inter-winded by this perfectionism and being slaved by this high, excessive request on myself. \n\n\"You have to get a job right now.\" \n\"You have to use X in this sentence.\"\n\"You have to send your resume right now.\"\n\"You have to pick up the phone right now.\"\n\"You have to ask yourself that question right now.\"\n\"You have to teach yourself the way Allison teach you right now.\"\n(I'm not a teacher, how can I teach like a teacher?)\n\"You have to polish your language like the people on there right now.\"\n\"You have to do it politely like networking right now.\"\n\"Do networking right now.\"\n\"You have to raise your hand to answer your question right now.\"\n\"You have to go inside and ask them right now.\"\n\"You have to polish ALL the grammar right now.

If I don't do it, I will receive guilt-tripping, punishment, pride feeding(enormous praise if I do it as a mean to push me do it),\nlingering advice on doing it, etc etc. \n\nTo this point, I have become a sick perfectionism. Pathetically living everyday in my little bubble, and forgot what \"normal standards\" are, not anymore. \n\n",

I always defence the abuser,  and always think they are not faulty even when they are being bully-ish or mean towards me.

He and my mother broke up (never married) when I was 9-10, and over the years I've realized how he manipulated me into rejecting my mother. \n\nShe was a bit cold and detached, she smacked me in the stomach once when I was misbehaving in the car, but otherwise was just dealing with her own depression and stuff. But my dad made it out that she was dangerous and \"if you only knew.\" That sort of thing. Called her every name in the book. But then made it seem like I could see her anytime, just that he didn't think it was a good idea...\n\nAnyway, 20 years later, I'm LC with my dad. He's... well, he's crazy. Came to terms with this with help from a therapist. My dad lives out of a car. Hates the government. Seems like he's got more than just narcissist problems.\n\nSo, my mother has been trying to contact me through facebook. She found me about two years ago. She sends me a message every few months. Just stuff like her phone number. Says she loves me and my brother. Hopes to start anew. Wants to talk. Very gentle and non-pushy.\n\nRecently, she messaged me saying I ought to Google \"parental alienation.\" Well, of course, it sounded exactly like what my dad did.\n\nSo, I'm so conflicted. I talked to the therapist who helped me with realizing my dad's problems about it, but he said to hold off so we could do it properly. Well, I switched therapists because of location and schedule, and we haven't quite got to how to reconnect with my new therapist... but this recent message from my mother has me spinning. I feel so bad for her. I feel like she's suffering. My greatest fear is that she might die of a heart attack or something before I even respond \"hi\" to one of her messages.\n\nHow do you start this sort of thing? Who out there has taken those sort of steps? Any best practices or resources you used? Any info would be much appreciated. Thanks!\n\nTL;DR: Convinced my N-dad alienated me from my mother 20 years ago, she's been trying to reconnect, and I'm ready to explore how to do that in a healthy, safe way for both me and my mother.\n\n\n",

In writing down my memories, I was struck by how much was \"I did such-and-such because I wanted to show how grown up I was so that she would start to respect me.\"\n\nI'm a person who values evidence and truth, and that's good. And I'd always felt like I had to have good evidence gathered before bothering a person about something that should be changed or done. Because certainly my wants alone weren't worth anything. (My ex sometimes asked me to think about what my wants and needs were, and it's hard for me to think of wanting things or that me wanting something has any relevance.)\n\nMy mother liked to claim that the reason I was a top student was \"all because\" she taught me the alphabet and read with me early. That always made me furious inside because I know damn well that I was a natural when it came to intellect.\n\nSo it's all...I don't want her to be able to \"claim\", even in a negative sense, any of what's good about me. Rationally I understand how every quality of mine had to break/navigate through my childhood, that it couldn't be otherwise, that I have no way to know the origins now, that even if it were known that something came out of my reactions to what was going on, I might as well be proud, regardless, of everything that's good inside me. I know, I know...  Such a need for the world to agree with me that I am good and she was bad. Of course the world does not know her or me like I do, so it seems the determination falls to me.\n\nPS This is brave of me, and out of character not to space out my posts more over time out of fear that some moderator will come and bitch at me. They're all valid topics, and I don't expect to add more today, AND why expect the worst from strangers who may be very good and level-headed and supportive people? Why not practice being brave and having a little hope?",
