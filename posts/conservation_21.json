I don't have my options listed out or anything, but the people who organize the program are really good at getting us where we want to go.\n\nI plan on going into conservation but i'm very indecisive. I think this will be a good opportunity to figure out if this is what I want to do, but I have no idea what places would help me decide. Any ideas?",
