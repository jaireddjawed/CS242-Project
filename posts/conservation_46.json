ATC is a for-profit company that is clear-cutting its easements as a matter of policy—not because it is required by federal or state governments, but in an attempt to improve its bottom line.\n\nYou can check out a video of the property and the full letter on the [Fellow Mortals FB page.](https://www.facebook.com/Fellow.Mortals/videos/1066232430086664/)\n\n\nFTA:\n\nATC enjoys ‘Green Tier Status,’ granted in 2005. If you agree that this company is being anything but a ‘superior environmental supporter’—please write and respectfully ask that the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources examine their relationship with this company.\n\nI personally find it disheartening and frightening that ATC apparently feels so powerful, and has such disregard for anything outside of their own business interests, that they believe they can act with impunity and are willing to push one small nonprofit–that exists solely for the benefit of the wildlife that inhabits the environment they pretend to care about– to the ropes, rather than examine the corporate policy that has taken so much from private landowners and made the company so many enemies as a result.\n\nProtesting injustice is what we do every day at Fellow Mortals, with every life we fight to save. Now we must save the place that makes our work possible.\n\n   \nYvonne Wallace Blane, Co-founder, Fellow Mortals Wildlife Hospital\n\nPlease send your respectful questions or comments to:\n\nWisconsin Department of Natural Resources http://dnr.wi.gov/\n\nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission http://www.ferc.gov/\n\nWisconsin Public Service Commission http://psc.wi.gov/",

Most of us don't understand how much electricity, natural gas, and water we use. It's like spending money without ever knowing how much you have in the piggy bank.\n\nIf you'd like to help me in my endeavour, I have a Google survey I'd love for you to fill out.\n\nhttp://goo.gl/forms/svAvJ9uzwd\n\nThanks,\nHardeep",
