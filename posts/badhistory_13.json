        "text": "The Small island of Singapore might seem like an unlikely source for bad history about China especially from one as educated and dignified as our former foreign minister but sadly it has come to that. In 2011 our Former Minister was defeated in a shocking election result and has since resigned from office. Sadly He decided to publish an editorial rife with bad history and a shocking amount of selective ignorance. \n\nlink: http://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/civilisational-states-like-china-are-less-prone-to-populism\n\nLet's start with this\n&gt;One of the main differences between China and the West is the way in which law is understood and applied. China was unified by conquest and through the strict application of law more than 2,000 years ago under the Qin dynasty. That dynasty did not last long and was followed by the Han dynasty, which governed China on Confucianist principles of proper behaviour.\n\nThis is a bit of gloss over of about 2 thousand years of history and ignores the various philosophical battles that raged on through China but is far too vague to rebut in any meaningful away.\n&gt;This application of law is in stark contrast to that of the Western Roman empire, which was contemporaneous with the Han dynasty in China. Rome was organised on the idea of law being above the emperor. After Rome fell, Roman law became the canon law of the Roman Church. The sacramental powers of a priest are legally conferred on him on earth (and therefore in heaven) and cannot be taken away from him even if he is in mortal sin. Such an idea of law made possible the creation of a multinational Roman Empire and, after that, a universal church. Law and religion united Western tribes.\n\nCanon law is only very loosely consent to Roman law in the sense that they came from around the same time. However legal history isn't something that is my expertise so I'm going to skip over that for now\n\n&gt;  but in a sophisticated way. Instead of brute force, more subtle methods are increasingly in use. Gmail, for example, is not banned outright, but simply slowed down\n\nThis isn't exactly history but it seems like he has confused Social-Media for Email which points to being extremely out of touch\n\n&gt; This is not accidental. Chinese dynasties could easily have expanded China to colonise non-Han people in large numbers but chose not to. Non-Han groups reside mainly in strategic border regions\n\nThis is where the real bad history begins, A trivial look at a map will show you that any further Chinese expansions would face problems, Expanding to the north puts various hard-to-control nomadic tribes withing your borders without gaining much resources or prestige in return while an expansion southward is blocked by the hilly jungles that make logistics virtually impossible and prevent the mobilization of any signficant military force in that area, Westward expansion faces a bare-desolate area with little resources and a hostile terrain. \nThis video helps explain the problems with Chinese expansion:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8uWoBtCkg8\n\n&gt; China, for its part, already has a strong leader in President Xi Jinping. But China is organised differently. In the Chinese mind, it is inconceivable that China could be led by a group at the top, the majority of whom are generals and billionaires.Scholars should be in charge of soldiers and businessmen - never the other way around. \n\nOh So the Chinese have never had any issues with populism and uprising, The taping rebellion never happened, Boxer rebellion was nothing but a dream, Great-leap-forward was a myth spread by the anti-china lobby and we never heard anything about no cultural revolution.\n\nSerious never once in this article about China and populism is the great-leap-forward of the cultural revolution mentioned despite fitting the idea to the tea, A leader blaming an elite for problems inflicting the masses of society and then promising easy solutions based on that was basically what the cultural revolution was, Mao promised teenagers and others that their problems were the fault of their parents and other ancient elite institutions while saying that the solution was to overthrow those insitutions. This editoral completely ignores that not even doing a off-hand reference in a way that is almost certainly a intentional omnission. This is bad-history because it ignores every history event that violates it's core thesis while concentraing on a few isolated examples.\n",

Your Red Barron cheese pizza will say something about the authentic Italian ciao bella averiderci mangiano that is in the thing you shove into your oven, and Trader Joe's samosas will have some stupid pun. But Saffron Road (TM) is associated with Whole Foods, so the back of the box will have some sort of bullshit nobody is supposed to read but separates it from the common people's frozen enchiladas. In this case, the text read:\n\n&gt;The Mesoamerican civilization of the mighty Maya flowered in Mexico’s Yucatán. Using hand-crafted Nixtamal, we have resurrected the authentic Yucatecan masa. Journey on the Saffron Road® and relish traditional flavors and robust spices of this ancient civilization. One bite of our enchiladas served with mesquite black beans and garlic rice and you too will be a mesoamericana.\n\nTo start with, the last sentence presents a sort of late capitalist nightmare in which our collective identity is so wrapped up in consumptive habits that a mere bite of these frozen enchiladas will allow me to assume the identity of \"mesoamericana\" (technically mesoamerican*o*, but three cheers for striking back against masculine normativity). But leaving that aside, the blurb contains a basic claim to legitimacy via historical linkage to the Maya. But does it hold up?\n\n[Wikipedia claims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enchilada#History) the enchilada's origins stretch far back into the precolombian past, and given that the definition of \"enchilada\" is apparently \"food wrapped in a maize tortilla\" I can say sure, I am pretty confident that existed a while back. I am also not so certain that the corn tortilla they use is really a genuine resurrected Mayan article, but again, sure, whatever. The real sticking point comes in the filling.\n\nTo start, in the description itself it makes reference to \"garlic rice\" in its paean to authentic precolombian cooking. To start, rice is not indigenous to the New World: there has been some debate about whether it originated in the Yangtze river valley, or somewhere else, usually southeast Asia. The balance of opinion is pretty heavily with the former, but even with that unsolved we can be pretty sure it was not Mesoamerica. Given the lack of secure evidence for contact between the Americas and Afro-Eurasia before Columbus aside from the Vikings, this makes it pretty unlikely that the Mayans filled their enchiladas, the definition of which has seriously downgraded, with rice. Let alone garlic rice, as garlic also originated in China and was well loved by the Mediterranean during Roman times.\n\nGoing deeper into the ingredient list, we can see a heavy reliance on dairy, but dairy products were unknown in the Americas before Columbus. There are mammals that were domesticated before Columbus in the Americas, primarily llamas and alpacas, but neither are really used to produce milk. So once again we have an Afro-Eurasian ingredient in the meal, I am even beginning to think it will not make me a Maya.\n\nFinally, black beans. [They originate in Peru!](http://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/24/science/science-watch-peru-cave-artifacts-are-10000-years-old.html?mcubz=1) So that is all good. The rest, not so much.\n\nSo there you have it: along with the general inauthenticity of a frozen food claiming to be just as the Maya had it!, there is also a specific inauthenticity in the ingredients. In case you were worried, it was pretty good, although the rice did not cook all the way through.",

        "text": "So Pirates of the Caribbean 5 is out and ho boy, what a bad movie, not quite as bad as the 4th but far worse than the original 3 films. But this isn't about its failures as a movie or as an entry into the franchise, this is about the badhistory. \n\n**Part One: Saint WHAAAAAAAT?**\n\nThe film spends a fair amount of time on a British island called Saint Martin. Now, they *do* get fuck up and refer to the town being called Saint Martin and the Island being called Saint Martin interchangeably, but unless they're in [Switzerland] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Martin,_Graub%C3%BCnden) for this section, we're taking about the Caribbean Island and lovely tourist destination, not any 18th century Caribbean Island town. \n\nThis is strange considering that the British never fucking owned Saint Martin in the Caribbean, they owned [St. Martin's Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Martin%27s_Island) in modern Bangladesh. As for the Caribbean island, the Dutch and the French split it in 1648 and it remains split to this day. The filmmakers couldn't have made it St Kitts or something? \n\n\n**Part 2: WHAT YEAR IS IT?** \n\n\nThe first 3 films of the franchise, as far as I recall, avoided anything that could be accurately dated to a specific year. Things like the East India Company existed for a long time and made it difficult to place where you were in history, which is a strength. The 4th and 5th film, well, not so much. \n\nIn the first act of the 5th film we are confronted with yet another potential execution of Captain Jack Sparrow. It's a \"new invention\" the administrating British officer says, \"the guillotine.\" Now beheading inventions have existed before this time but Joseph-Ignace Guillotin first proposed an idea for it in 1789 and the first actual execution with it was 1792. Given this information we can presume this film takes place in the 1790s.\n\nThis is quite an interesting because in the 4th \"film\" Jack Sparrow meets George II of Great Britain. George II died in 1760, roughly 30 years prior to the guillotine and therefore the 5th film.\n\nBut wait, who was in that last film? George II and....Blackbeard? Edward Teach died in 1718, before George II was even on the throne and a around 75 years prior to the Guillotine and therefore...the 5th film?\n\n\"But 40kfreak!\" you cry, \"in the 4th movie the major plot development was the fountain of youth! Surely there could be some fuckery there to explain this!\" and granted, Orlando Bloom *does* look about 75 years older in the film. Alas no, you can't magic this shit away, because the 4th movie takes place, according to wikipedia, 13 years after the events of the 3rd movie. In the 5th movie they specifically reference that it's been 5 years since the events of the 4th, making it only 18 years since the 3rd film. Furthermore the character of \"Will's son\" (I literally just saw this movie and I don't remember his name), is 20ish, and that dude had nothing to do with the Fountain of Youth shenanigans. \n\nSo far from questioning what year it is, we need to ask ourselves what *era* this is. Is it the golden age of piracy? the ~1750s? The French Revolution? \n\n\n\nIn conclusion, Rhodesia's \"efforts\" to have a peaceful transfer of power to Zimbabwe-Rhodesia is not an convincing moral defense of Smith's regime because it was obvious by that point that ZANU was winning given Rhodesia's manpower and material limitations. It was therefore not a genuine effort at racial or political reconciliation but rather an attempt to avoid capitulating entirely.\n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/6dqi0l/the_deadliest_warrior_more_like_the_most/",
        "text": "I cannot speak for everyone, but I know that when I sit around on my ass watching [reruns of “The Deadliest Warrior”](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x50c8zv), I expect absolute historical accuracy.  Imagine my shock and dismay when the various weapons were introduced for a legendary donnybrook between the Mafia and the Yakuza.\n\nThe Yakuza in question, dated to 1947, are equipped with nunchaku (close range), a Walther P38 (mid-range), a Sten (long range), sai (special weapons), and ceramic grenades (explosives).  The Mafia, dated to 1929, are equipped with a baseball bat (close range), a sawed-off shotgun (mid-range), a Tommy gun (long range), an ice pick (special), and a Molotov cocktail (explosive).\nEven setting aside the bad history inherent to calling such an explosive a “Molotov cocktail”, as the term for such a weapon didn’t come into usage until around 1940, the specs on one major weapon are a bit off.\n\n[Beginning at 20:09](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x50c8zv), the baseball bat is described as being three feet long, weighing in at two pounds, and being made of ash or maple wood.  The design is pretty simple: the wood flairs down from the knob to the handle, then consistently tapers back out all the way to the end of the barrel.  In other words, standard baseball bat specs.\n\nFor as long as there has been baseball, there have been bats used to strike the ball with.  Being able to hit a baseball is kind of important for players, unless you're Rey Ordonez.  In the early days, hitters would either whittle or carve their own bats from a single piece of wood.  This changed in 1884, when a 17-year-old boy in Louisville named John (\"Bud\") Hillerich was watching a game featuring the hometown Louisville Eclipse.  Star outfielder Pete Browning broke his bat, and Hillerich suggested that his father’s woodworking shop could produce a better and more durable one.  That night, Hillerich and Browning picked out a piece of white ash wood, and Hillerich turned it into a suitable bat for professional use.  Browning had been mired in a hitting slump, but went three-for-three the next day with his new bat.  He told his teammates, and within a generation bat manufacturing had forever removed the need for players to create their own bats.\n\nThis mirrored what we see in professional sports and nearly all walks of life: success breeding imitation.  Professional players could test out all sorts of pre-made options and find out what worked best for them, and the consistency of quality from trained woodworkers meant that players all the way down into childhood could swing a bat made just like their heroes.  Hillerich may have made the first true professional model, but he was far from the only skilled woodworker with a love of the game.  By the time the 19th century turned into the 20th, sporting goods manufacturers across the country were producing bats with their logos on them.\n\nRemember, though, that success breeds imitation, and the growth of sports journalism gave a new venue for successful hitters to share what made them successful.  And the best hitters in the professional ranks were usually more than happy to talk about their bats.  Sure, they’d all be somewhere between 33” and 36” long, but the weights usually would vastly exceed the 33-ounce featherweights that we see today.  Edd Roush, a lifetime .323 hitter and two-time batting champion, swung a 48-ounce bat.  Even today, 90 years after his retirement, his [game-used bats still weigh in at around or more than 40 ounces](https://goldinauctions.com/ItemImages/000018/18263h_lg.jpeg).  One auctioned earlier this year that still tipped the scales at [a hefty 43 ounces](http://sports.mearsonlineauctions.com/LotDetail.aspx?inventoryid=107942).  Frank “Home Run” Baker swung a 52-ounce monstrosity made from hickory wood, but primarily used bats that weighed between 40-48 ounces during his Hall of Fame career.  Ty Cobb used ones that weighed between [35-44 ounces](http://sports.mearsonlineauctions.com/1925_ty_cobb_h_b_louisville_slugger_game_used_auto-lot36569.aspx) during a career that saw him put up more hits than anyone who wasn’t gambling on baseball.  Shoeless Joe Jackson used bats in excess of 40 ounces, with a [41-ounce example](http://sports.mearsonlineauctions.com/lot-42247.aspx) from his outlaw ball days surviving.  A game-used bat from Tris Speaker [weighs in at over 39 ounces](http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/Lot/tris-speaker-professional-model-bat-6021421-details.aspx).  A [45-ounce bat of Dave Bancroft]( http://sports.mearsonlineauctions.com/LotDetail.aspx?inventoryid=36442) hit the auction block, Babe Ruth was known to use bats over 40 ounces…the list goes on and on.  There’s a surviving Buck Weaver game bat that was 38 ounces, Jake Daubert of around 40 ounces, and so on.\n\nWas there variance?  Absolutely.  Baseball players may be creatures of habit, but they’re also willing to change those habits when home runs start becoming long outs, or when solid contact becomes a double play.  Players would experiment with different bat lengths and weights, but not necessarily to a massive extent.  There aren’t records, for example, of a player ordering a batch of 31” bats that weighed 32 ounces alongside another batch of 36” bats that weighed 42 ounces.\n\nStars of professional baseball from 1910-1929, by and large, were using *heavy* bats in play.  This would naturally trickle down into the retail bat marketplace, where the average Saturday player wouldn’t be able to buy one that was exactly the same as his favorite player.  But could he come close?\n\n[This ad](http://www.blackbetsy.com/imagefarm/joe-jackson-decal-bat-ad.jpg), dated to sometime in the 1910-1916 time frame due to the reference to Frank Baker as “Good Night” instead of “Home Run”, shows that the answer was “yes”.  A Joe Jackson model retail bat could be ordered with a weight of between 38 and 46 ounces, and a Tris Speaker between 36 and 44 ounces.  The listed crate weight of “about 110 pounds” for three dozen (36) bats is the same for those as it is with the other bats with unlisted weights.  We do see other [ads for retail bats]( http://keymancollectibles.com/images/img341.jpg) that do not list weights.\n\nUnlike most other manufactured tools, or tools that can be used as weapons, there is significant variance of the weight of a baseball bat.  Yes, it would have been possible for our Mafia enforcer to have used a 32-ounce retail model baseball bat to silence someone.  It’s also possible that he would have used a 38-, a 42-, or even a 48-ounce hickory bat to do the job.  For \"The Deadliest Warrior\" to simply wave their hands and say that a baseball bat used by the Mafia would have weighed in at two pounds is not necessarily true, and the difference between a two-pound bat and a three-pound bat is significant.\n\nThe type of wood that was used to make such a bat most likely would have been white ash.  Most of the professional models used at the time were white ash because it was possible to select extremely high quality examples, and most retail models still used white ash because it was plentiful enough to be cheap and still provide a quality product.  Hanna, for example, started by using southern ash but switched to white ash because of issues with the way that humidity would degrade southern ash.\nBut \"The Deadliest Warrior\" would have us believe that these bats, circa 1929, would have been either ash or maple.  Ash would have been likely, hickory possible but unlikely, with the chance of a bat made from a multitude of other woods like sycamore that were still used (albeit sparingly) at various levels during the 1910-1929 time period.\n\nMaple, though?\n\nIn the early days of bat manufacturing, when players were responsible for producing their own bats, it’s certainly possible that maple wood was used sporadically.  The issue with maple, however, is that it’s fairly dense and extremely difficult to carve, whittle, or turn on a lathe; this goes double for a mostly-untrained woodworker like a professional baseball player.  There are references to pine bats being used, which would have little advantage outside of being easy for an unskilled player to produce a smooth bat with.  The early *manufactured* bats were overwhelmingly ash wood, and by 1900 pretty much every bat in use professionally was manufactured rather than being made by a player.  Skilled woodworkers still could, and would, use other woods, but there do not seem to be records of maple wood being used for manufacturing professional bats or even the retail bats.\n\nMaple bats are popular today, but when did this begin?  And would our Mafia enforcer in 1929 have been able to use one to break the ribs of a squealer?\n\nThe answer, shockingly, is “no”.  He could not have used one, because the manufacturing of maple baseball bats did not begin on any scale until **1998**.  [From the NY Times, dated June 19, 1998](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/19/sports/need-good-wood-a-batmaker-tries-maple.html):\n\n&gt;What is the secret? Why does Carter, a potential Hall of Famer who has knocked in at least 100 runs in 11 of his 16 seasons, adore a bat that he did not begin using until last season while with the Blue Jays, a bat he sneaked into at least one game in 1997 before it was officially approved by Major League Baseball? \n&gt;\n&gt;''It's maple,'' Carter revealed. ''They're made out of maple.'' That's it, the secret in its entirety. Carter is the most vocal of the two dozen major league clients of Sam Holman, a waggish 53-year-old from Ottawa who responded to a bar challenge from a baseball scout two years ago by carving a bat from wood from a rock maple tree, not the northern ash wood from which virtually all bats are made.\n&gt;\n&gt;''I couldn't make a better ash tree,'' Holman said, ''and I knew there was more than one way to make a bat.''\n&gt;\n&gt;So Holman formed the Original Maple Bat Corporation and has devoted the last two years to making maple bats and trying to gain a slice of a market dominated by Hillerich &amp; Bradsby, a 115-year-old Louisville, Ky., company that provides Louisville Sluggers to almost 70 percent of major league players. Trying to break into a sport steeped in tradition and superstition, often in defiance of logic and self-interest, Holman has a daunting task.\n\nReferring to Joe Carter as “a potential Hall of Famer” is absurd enough, but this article from 1998 details how unusual the very idea of a maple bat is.   From the same article:\n\n&gt;Nonetheless, why did it take decades for someone to consistently use maple to make bats? It is not Kryptonite, after all. \n&gt;\n&gt;''When you think about it, I guess that is a little strange,'' said Toronto outfielder Shawn Green, who has used maple bats in practice. ''You'd think it would have happened before.''\n&gt;\n&gt;Holman, a former stagehand with the National Arts Center in Ottawa, said that bat manufacturers apparently shied away from the heavier wood because it is known for being ''too brittle'' and difficult to control because of its density. \n\nSo there you have it.  \"Two pounds\" is a *possibility* but not a certainty for the weight of a baseball bat in 1929.  And our Mafia enforcer would have used a lot of heavy stick-like objects to dispatch a stool pigeon, but we do know for sure that it would *not* have been a maple baseball bat.",

        "text": "My first post here, i just had to make a post about this video. The main issue i have with the video is all the myths and misconceptions. Germany is viewed as the perfect war machine with tanks and mechanised units when in fact that was the minority of the forces, and that the russians managed won with their huge hordes of mass produced tanks against the superior german tanks.\n\nThe video:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUgV8_meyo8&amp;feature=youtu.be\n\n0:12 \"ww1 was a static grueling war\"\n\nOn the western front sure, but on the eastern front and elsewhere warfare wasn't static. \n\n1:02 \"With these machines in your arsenal (Tanks and motorised units) trench warfare became obsolete.\" \n\nTrench warfare is still used today and was extensively used by all sides during ww2, its not like tanks and motorised vehicles made holes in the ground bad cover.\n\n1:18 \"This of course was the infamous blitzkrieg which germany employed to take over the majority of europe.\"\n\nBlitzkrieg is not a german tactic or strategy, it was mostly used as a propaganda word after the sucess against the western allies at the start of the war. \n\n\n7:10 \"The russian were building a staggering secret army of t-34s.\n\nRight, the hordes of crappy t-34s are coming to overwhelm the superior german panzerkampfwagen /s. By operation barbarossa the t-34 was not the primary fighting vehicle used by the soviet union. In fact by 1940 only [115](http://www.armchairgeneral.com/rkkaww2/weapons/afv_production_20_41.htm) t-34s were built. The t-34 would go into major production after the war started. \n\n\n8:04 \"While russia saw how to beat the blitzkrieg in shear numbers determination, armor and firepower\" \n\nYes the \"blitzkrieg\" was beaten by generic conventional warfare terms. While the soviets would outnumber the germans espiecally later in the war, armor, firepower and determination was not something that the germans lacked either. There were alot more factors involved than that.\n\n10:41 \"This was russias last stand\" Not really the battle of kursk was of major importance but the soviet union was far from losing the war at that point. They had just beaten the germans at stalingrad and things were looking much better for them.\n\nFeel free to correct me.\n\n\nEdit: Appearantly blitzkrieg is the correct term in this situation my bad.\n\nEdit2: Improved some words and sentences to make more sense, sorry about that...",

        "text": "First off, thanks to everyone for the popularity of the first shitpost and many apologies to everyone for the delay.  A bunch of \"real life\" things came up that prevented me from sitting down and writing things on an actual computer.  If you missed part 1, this is the continuation of https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/6d27pw/haus_of_saud_the_wahabaning/\n\n----\n\nJune 1818.  Ruined Saudi capital of Diriyah.  Buildings leveled. Palm trees cut down.  Bodies everywhere.  Signs of an extended siege.  \n\n*record scratch*\n\nHi, I bet you're wondering how we got here and what exactly went wrong.\n\nWell.  \n\nRemember back in Part 1, the Wahabaning, where I mentioned that the Ottoman Empire didn't give a FUCK (Ottoman Theme Song for Arabia: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZR_X6PrASho) as long as three things (Mecca, Medina, and money) were left alone?  Here's why:\n\nLooking here (https://media1.britannica.com/eb-media/89/4789-004-60DFAD69.jpg) at a map of the Empire, control of the Arabian peninsula was based primarily upon control of the coastal regions.  The interior of Arabia wasn't what you'd call 'important' for much of anything, with the exception of a few agricultural areas based upon oasi and pilgrim routes.  Just look at this rainfall map:  https://www.juancole.com/images/2010/12/saudi_rain1.jpg\n\nExample weather broadcast: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpktBGInl60\n\nAll this meant that the Ottomans just didn't bother to concern themselves with the little details of who did what in Arabia.  Their main concern was the Hejaz region, which is the region surrounding the Red Sea coast and containing Mecca/Medina.  Even the Hejaz they farmed out to someone else.  Some group called the Hashemi, also known as the Hashemites.  You may remember the Hashemites as the buddies of TE Lawrence in a little known art film, \"Lawrence of Arabia.\"\n\nThen the Sauds got overzealous and went after the holy cities of Mecca and Medina.  Successfully captured them in 1803. Kicked the Hashemites and the Ottomans out. Also denounced the Ottoman Emperor's right to be caliph since how can you be caliph if you don't control the holy cities of Islam?\n\nTotally valid points.  Points that the Sultan Mustafa IV agreed with, since he wasn't in the firmest position of authority, and couldn't afford to take any more hits to his authority due to reasons discussed further down.  I mean these were cities that the Ottomans had held for the last 300 years lost to some random desert tribe!  INSANITY! Release Muhammed Ali to FLOAT LIKE A BUTTERFLY AND STING LIKE A BEE!\n\nHowever, I'm getting ahead of myself.  We really need to talk quickly about the state of the Ottoman Empire in the 18th century before going any further.  It'll provide some context to how and why things in Arabia were let to slide so far out of control.\n\nYou see, the Ottoman Empire in the early 1800's was undergoing quite a lot of turmoil.  Things had changed quite a bit since the 1700's, especially in regards to internal borders.  There were border struggles with the Russians, Serbian independence movements (moderately successful), political in-fighting, and a worse than useless military.\n\nStarting with the military, I'm fairly certain everyone reading as heard of the Janissaries at some point.  Those who haven't, the Jannissaries were \"slave\" soldiers (reality by the 1800's a semi-feudal system based on a fief structure) that made up the backbone of the traditional Ottoman Empire's military.  They were a key part of Ottoman success during their expansion so gained a large amount of political importance that was similar to that of the Roman Praetorian guard.  Mostly the, \"We can always find another Emperor\" sort of importance.  \n\nUnfortunately for the Janissaries, like any other long lived institution, they stopped being as critical to the Empire as they thought by the early 1800's.  Unfortunately for the Ottoman Emperors (of which there were 3 between 1807-1808), they were still entrenched enough to be a giant pain in the ass.  Remember when I said that Mustafa IV wasn't in the best of positions?  Wellllll.  \n\nMustafa's predecessor, Selim III, was a pretty forward thinking guy out of necessity.  The Ottomans didn't fare very well in the Austro-Turkish war (1788-1791) or the Russo-Turkish war (1787-1792).  Selim wanted to stop a lot of the stagnation, drag the Ottomans into the modern age.  A key part of this was reforming the Janissaries, who didn't want to play the 'reform' game.  \n\nSelim had an answer for this, though!  Break the nobles (Janissaries) to his will!  If Peter the Great could do it to the Russians, he could do it!  Selim decided to make his own army made up of ethnic Turks from Anatolia. Aptly enough he called it the New Order.  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nizam-i_Djedid)  Similar to European armies of the time, conscription was a large part of this plan.  Normal people were to be the backbone of the state! \n\nNope.  Fuck that.  Knifed in the harem.  RIP.  Long live Sultan Mustafa IV, supporter of the Janissaries!\n\nAll of this put together meant that when the Saudis did their little \"denounce the Sultan\" trick while in control of Mecca and Medina, Sultan Mustafa IV (aka 'that guy who took power after a Janissary led revolt in 1807') couldn't afford to ...  \n\n&gt; **o/~ Let it go, \nlet it go,\nTurn away and slam the door,\nI don't care,\nwhat they're going to say,\nLet the storm rage on o/~**\n\nAnd let the storm rage on he did!  ... sort of.  Not really.  He died before his orders to the ruler of Egypt (Muhammed Ali) were actually acted upon.  Natural causes.  Naturally bled to death after a shaving accident in 1808.  Long live Sultan Mahmud II!!\n\nAnyway, by 1811 things were a bit more in order so CUE THE WAR!   (https://www.onwar.com/aced/chrono/c1800s/yr10/fwahhabi1811.htm)  One of the problems I have right now, though, is finding specific sources about how the war was prosecuted by the Egyptians.  I'm sure any set piece battles were heavily impacted by Ottoman artillery (per the linked page and wiki), as well as general coordination.  What interests me is the logistics involved getting the Ottoman troops to the interior and keeping them supplied long enough to conduct a siege during the summer.\n\nHere's the basic rundown: \n\n1811, Ottomans kicked the Saudis out of Mecca and Medina.\n\n1817 Muhammad Ali decides to not I'M SO PRETTY I'M SO PRETTY! the Sauds himself, sends his son Ibrahim (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibrahim_Pasha_of_Egypt) to finish it off.  Again, referencing the rainfall map, even making it to Diriyah was a military feat.  Much less finishing off a siege and completely breaking the military power of a force that could range from Mecca to Karbala.\n\n1818 Saudis completely crushed\n\nHonestly the how and why doesn't matter as much.  What matters is that control of Mecca and Medina was back in the hands of the group who'd ruled the cities for 900 years!  \n\nbut.  Wait.  What?  The Ottomans had held the cities for 300 years!  Who had it for 900?  Why, the Hashemites, of course, because as it turns out the Ottomans never actually conquered the Hejaz.\n\nWhich is where we're getting into the meat of this whole, \"Except, we put the Wahhabi government in exclusive power in the first place so that we could get exclusive access to the oil,\" Badhistory.\n\nhttp://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/the-ottomans-and-the-city-of-mecca-.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=27037&amp;NewsCatID=438\n\nhttp://digitalcommons.kennesaw.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1184&amp;context=jgi\n\nYou see, back in 1516 the Ottomans conquered the Mamluk kingdom of Egypt with a pretty whiz-bang campaign over the course of two years.  Upon completion of the campaign the Ottomans took on all territories and titles the Mamluks had held.  Most notably Caliph: Religious leader of the Islamic world.\n\nNot really wanting any part of a war, the Hashemi Sharif of Mecca jumped on the bandwagon as long as his family were still able to be considered the rulers of the Hejaz.  All that changed were some Ottoman troops in the key cities instead of Egyptian.  Upkeep money for Mecca, Medina, and pilgrim routes came from the Ottomans, too.  Ottomans in turn were able to claim the title of Caliph and call themselves the defenders of Islam, giving their continued control (and aspirations towards) areas following Islam legitimacy.  All in all not a bad deal for everyone involved.\n\nSo again, let's roll back to when the Saudis first conquered Mecca and Medina.  Given the new information, do you really think that the Ottomans cared about an internal Arabian power struggle?  NOPE.  It was that whole chant of, \"You're not a legitimate leader!\" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhYAK3y9_r8) that caused the uproar.\n\nWhich also really puts the Hashemites in a different perspective.  They were unable to defend an area they'd ruled for 900 years from the Saudis without the assistance of the Ottomans.  Obviously there was something going on there.  \n\nCould it be that\n\npossibly\n\nmaybe\n\njust\n\njust maybe?\n\nThe Najd was a force to be reckoned with?",

This is another episode in the 'wonderful' Conquest series, and is titled The Axeman Cometh:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FH_j1ItgWg\n\nI have an imaginary bottle of Teacher's Highland Whiskey handy, so let us begin!\n\n0.32: That is a not a style of glove used in England in the 9th century AD. Way to modern. DRINK!\n\n0.37: PRELUDE TO HOLLYWOOD DUAL-WIELDING! DRINK!\n\n0.39: My nemesis, Peter Woodward, states that the Vikings and Saxons were amongst history's most brutal warriors. Except no. Brutality must be measured by the ethical and moral principles common in the relevant society at the time period. Thus the manner in which the Anglo-Saxons conducted themselves was acceptable by the standards of English society, and the Viking method of warfare conformed to the values of Scandinavian society. Attempting to judge warfare by the ideals of a different time period is the very epitome of badhistory. DRINK!\n\n0.41: That warrior just threw his battle-axe into the air and spun it round. Because moments before a fight you want to try chop your fingers off.\n\n0.49: HOLLYWOOD DUAL-WIELDING! DRINK!\n\n1.10: DOUBLE BITTED FANTASY AXE! DRINK\n\n1.13: One of the 'historical weapons' is just a modern axe used for chopping wood. DRINK!\n\n1.15: The host says the axe is the most difficult weapon his minions are every going to learn. I dispute that as, having done long-sword training in the German tradition, fighting with a sword involves way more stances, footwork, guards, wards and strikes compared to axe which had a much more limited range of attacks and was often intended to be used with a shield. DRINK!\n\n1.25: The head of that axe is *way* too large to make an effective weapon. DRINK!\n\n1.38: \"Our conquest team is an experienced bunch\". Yes, experienced at anachronism.\n\n1.50: A major inaccuracy here as one of the warriors is a woman. DRINK!\n\n2.00: The host says the axe is the only ancient weapon that most of us has had experience of. Because no one has ever used a knife.\n\n2.02: The host proclaims the axe to be heavy. War axes were quite light. If you look at various axe-heads, they are often quite small and thin. Their effectiveness came from the weight of the weapon being concentrated at the head combined with a small and focused cutting edge. The size of the axe-heads allowed them to swung quickly, building up even more energy. DRINK!\n\n2.05: The host states that using the axe wrecks your back. Again, war axes were fairly light and did not require much strength to use, and so did not put much strain on the body. DRINK!\n\n3.04: The host explains that mankind had flint axes, and then bronze. He neglects to mention that people used copper axes for a long time before adopting bronze. DRINK!\n\n3.18: The host says that the axe was the deadliest weapon on the battlefield. Again, no. There is no such  thing as \"deadliest\" as all weapons had specific uses. The spear could keep opponents at a distance whilst a mace would be better against armor, for example. DRINK!\n\n4.08: The heads of the axes are way to large for a one-handed battle-axe, which would look for like this: \n\nhttp://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/manufacturing/text/viking_axe.htm\n\nOf course they are getting tired! DRINK!\n\n4.17: And now the host is advocating using a battle-axe in two hands and dropping the shield, which would be a good way to get stabbed for the average warrior. DRINK!\n\n4.33: HOLLYWOOD WEAPON TWIRLING! DRINK!\n\n5.33: We know this footage is from the Dark Ages because it is in black and white.\n\n5.49: A swordsmen with a shield is fighting a person with a single battle-axe but no shield. Do you want to be skewered? Because that's how you get skewed.\n\n6.49: This \"fight\" ignores the fact the fellow with the sword does not have to swing at all, but merely thrust *under* his shield whilst the other one attacks. Mean-whilst, the dude hacking constantly would just get tired.\n\n7.31: Oh, Jesus Christ! He has no shield and is flailing his weapon wildly! A warrior who knew what they were doing would just stab him in the throat.\n\n7.59: \"You'd might have guessed by now, but I'm trying to prove a point\". That you're an idiot?\n\n8.19: The host asserts that the guys who uses axes did not bother with defense at all. Meanwhile, here is an image of an ancient Greek vase showing a Persian warrior with an axe and shield:\n\nhttp://www.cais-soas.com/CAIS/Images2/Military/persian_axe.gif\n\nDRINK!\n\n9.43: The host calls Viking berserkers the \"ninjas of their society.\" Lol wut? Ninja were individuals specialized in espionage and assassination, whilst Berserkers were dudes who went crazy on the field of battle and had as much finesse as the comedy in an Adam Sandler movie. DRINK!\n\n10.48: \"And he's got an axe, so what do you do?\" You stab him the face with a spear?\n\n11.03: The host says the fighting techniques of the axe rely on aggression. Absolutely not. With a good shield, defensive tactics are perfectly viable. DRINK!\n\n11.06: HOLLYWOOD WEAPON TWIRLING! DRINK!\n\n11.07: \"When using the axe alone, the warrior must keep it moving.\" Yet again, no. Doing that  constantly would tired you out, and a smart opponent would wait until the axe is in a position that is difficult to recover from before attacking. \n\n11.14: MORE HOLLYWOOD WEAPON TWIRLING! DRINK!\n\n11.22: \"Guys, we can only attack him one at a time. Shut up, Hjarnolf, I don't know why.\"\n\n11.52: The 'lighter' axe once again uses an improbably large head. DRINK!\n\n12.12: Mother of God, now the host is advocating using a double-bitted axe, which was a pure fantasy weapon except for specific examples in the ancient period which used very small heads. DRINK!\n\n12.42: The host says throwing axes are not easy to use, because learning how hurl something is a skill that truly takes years to master.\n\n13.05: The host states the Saxons used to throw axes as a means of measuring land. No, they used the hide, which was the amount of land required to feed one household. DRINK!\n\n13.43: This scene representing 11th century England has late medieval pole-arms in the background. DRINK!\n\n13.52: The host says Harold Hardrada was king of the Norwegian Vikings. Harold was the king of *Norway*, not a group of Vikings. DRINK!\n\n14.06: The host says 1066 was the axe's finest hour. If any weapon can be attributed to having a \"finest hour\", it was the bow for thinning out Harold's shieldwall at Hastings.

        "text": "This badhistory came from here: \n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/6cyrlg/whiteowned_restaurants_shamed_for_serving_ethnic/dhyrsdg/\n\nThe context is a discussion of the history of barbecue (in the comments about an article on cultural appropriation), where one user says it was invented by Germans and the other by native peoples of the Americas. The Germanist user replied to a comment from the Indigenist user with the statement quoted in the title. It's wrong. \n\nIn fact they're both wrong. Obviously this discussion depends on what definition of barbecue is being used, but the users seem to be using one of \"cooking meat over a fire\", which is one I can certainly agree with. Archaeological evidence for cooking meat over fire predates the concepts of \"Germans\" and \"Indians\" by hundreds of thousands of years. Heck, it much predates the existence of *Homo sapiens* and even *Homo neanderthalensis*, not to mention human presence in the American continent. This evidence has been found in many sites across Africa, Asia, and Europe, including but not limited to: Swartkrans, the Qesem Caves, Zhoukoudian, and Vértesszőlős. \n\nInterestingly, indigenous peoples in the Americas did certainly contribute to the history of barbecue, such as in the name, which is widely believed to come from the word *barabicu* by way of the Spanish *barbacoa*. The Oxforf English Dictionary traces it back to Haiti but it and similar terms were probably in use throughout the greater Caribbean by speakers of languages in the Arawakan family. There is basically no evidence to suggest barbecuing people is how this got started. In fact, an interesting aside is that a colonial-era primary source (Olaudah Equiano's autobiography) mentions indigenous people (specifically the Miskito people) barbecuing alligator: \"The alligators were killed and some of them roasted. Their method of roasting is by digging a hole in the earth, and filling it with wood, which they burn to coal, and then they lay sticks across, on which they set the meat.\" This description is remarkably similar to barbecuing as we know it today in North and South America. \n\nSources: \n\nhttp://old.cbbqa.org/history/secondary/OxfordEngDictionary.html\n\nhttps://books.google.com.br/books/about/The_Interesting_Narrative_of_the_Life_of.html?id=91F2Ktx12YkC&amp;redir_esc=y\n\n(Page 226)",

        "text": "Pursuant to the demands of Lord Snappy the Shillest, son of Turing, I have been trawling Reddit, awaiting the appearance of low hanging Arab badhistory fruit.  Today I was successful.\n\nLet's start with the offender:\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/6czq6e/why_are_we_selling_these_guys_weapons_again/dhyys1g/\n\n&gt; Except, we put the Wahhabi government in exclusive power in the first place so that we could get exclusive access to the oil.\n\nThe thing is, one of these days I need to rebuild my library of books.  Fortunately I'm armed with a TEENY TINY BIT OF WOKE so why bother when there's plenty of timeline references out there that are good enough to handle things like this.  It's also low hanging enough that I can re-use portions of an older post.\n\nUsual warning, this post is for basic informational and entertainment purposes.  I will get things wrong, things that are easily noticable by the pedantic library dwellers that populat this sub.  I expect people to point these wrong things out.  This is little more than a high effort shitpost with the profanity to match.  Turn away now.\n\nPretending we're on a cooking show, let's deconstruct this sentence \n\n* we\n\nWho is, \"We\" exactly?  The US?  Britain?  Turkey?  Russia?  WHO MEDDLED IN THIS DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTION!?!?\n\nShockingly it turns out that it was the Sauds who put themselves in power through willpower, gumption, and good ol' violent expansion.  \n\nYou see, dear readers, Muhammad bin Saud woke up one day in the Emirate of Diriyah and said, \"There must be more than this provincial life!\" This lyric failed to spark a rousing musical number about a girl's discomfort in her restrictive French town.  Instead it sparked a hunger for territorial expansion.  Unfortunately for Muhammad ibn Saud, just wanting to get a bit more territority in the Najd wasn't enough.  He had to have a reason for it.  Turns out that cassi belli don't just grow on trees.\n\nOR DO THEY?!!?\n\nThen one day in 1744, as he was out strolling through the market singing his signature tune, he met one Muhammad bin Abdul Wahab. Muhammad bin Abdul Wahab (look I seriously have to use the whole name, I can't just use the first name or this will get confusing, quickly) was a guy with a vision and a plan based upon the teachings of the literalist Hanbali school of Sunni Islam.  The Hanbali utilized writings from the Quaran or Hadiths to answer whatever questions came up, nothing else.\n\nMonsieur Wahab had recently relocated after a previous position of kingmaker via religion fell through in part due to his literally cutting down a tree.  He also destroyed the grave of one of the Sahabah (Companions of Mohammed (PBUH)) and organized the stoning of a woman for adultery.  Pretty certain the tree destruction was the most important part, though.\n\nAt this point Monsieur Saud had that reason in the form of the greatest cassus belli ever: religion. Those guys over there are wrong, we're right, btw they've also got some shit we can loot so come join us.  FOR THE GREATER GOOD!\n\nKeep in mind that even though this area was under the control of the Ottoman Empire, the Ottomans Didn't Give a FUCK what happened within the Arabian Penninsula (AP) as long as taxes came in and their control of Mecca/Medina wasn't threatened.  I repeat, as long as control of Mecca/Medina wasn't threatened.  This may or may not be important later.\n\nI'm pretty certain there weren't musical numbers involved with this but I'd like to imagine it's much like Le Fou and Gaston singing in Gaston's tavern.  These two were such best buddies that they decided to FOREVER CEMENT THEIR LOVE with the marriage of their children.\n\nIn short plain terms, the Saudis and Wahabis got married.  Literally.  The descendents of this marriage (the Al ash-Sheikh) still exist and are the second most important family in Saudi Arabia next to the actual Saud family.  The Al ash-Sheikh family are the religious authorities that prop up the Saud family.\n\nOld ibn Saud ran through his time, established the House of Saud as a major power in the region.  Eventually his Wahabi married son, Abdul-Aziz bin Muhammad bin Saud, became king (1765, which incidentally was pre-foundation of the United States of America) AND BOOM SHAKALAKA SHIT WENT DOWN!\n\nNamely the Saudis were strong enough to raid as far as the Shia cities of Karbala and Najaf, sacking the everliving fuck out of Karbala under the auspices of Saud bin Abdul-Aziz bin Muhammad bin Saud.  Not exactly an insignificant force to reach that far north.  \n\nThen in 1803 Old Abdul-Aziz took a stiletto to the chest from an Iraqi, making Saud bin Abdul-Aziz bin Muhammad bin Saud king of the First Saudi State.\n\nThis is where our story ends for now, to be continued in a few (6?) hours.  Will the Saudis piss off the Ottomans?  Will they get skull fucked back into their little town, then have their town torn down around their ears?  Will they later become the undisputed rulers of the entire AP?  OMG WHAT NEXT?!?!? \n\nedit:\n\nSources:  Where we're going, we don't need sources.  /u/Dirish and the oppressive mod team do, though.  Fortunately R5 allows wiki.  I'd stated above that the majority of what I was using is repackaged basic timeline knowledge.  The only exception is the tree cutting (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_ibn_Abd_al-Wahhab) which is sourced twice on Wiki.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirate_of_Diriyah\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul-Aziz_bin_Muhammad\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_bin_Saud\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_ash-Sheikh\n\nI highly, highly recommend reading through these wiki pages.

        "text": "My previous post, and its reception, inspired me to go about posting some more criticisms of bad history in histeria and animaniacs\n\n\nFirst up, [bouncing on Churchill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HibHeY4UiPU) (thanks to BoscotheBear for pointing this out).\n\nFirst and formost, despite Roosevelt's well known willingness to deal with Stalin, under the belief he could be controlled, the post war negotiations, such as the fate of Romania, were not dealt with by Stalin merely asking if he could 'have it'. The liberated nations were, per the declaration on Liberated Europe, meant to to \"create democratic institutions of their own choice,\" not merely become Soviet puppets.\n\nSecondly, there were no black, talking cat people things at the conference. Were such things to exist, it is unlikely that they would have been allowed that close to the big three. \n\nThirdly, despite Churchill's large size (forgive me, I couldn't find his exact weight in 1944), you can't use a fat man as a bouncy castle. 'specially not a man of Stalin's size.\n\n\n**NEXT**\n\n\n[Stabbed the story in the back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GComvtenvvk). e.g. 'Stabbed me in the back.'\n\n&gt;Et tu, Brutus, Or should I call you Judas,\n\n1)Caesar's last words were not 'Et tu, Brutus', it's...well. Suetonius puts it at \"καὶ σὺ, τέκνον;\". It's debatable. At any rate, the one that is famous is from Shakespeare, who put it in Latin as that was the speech of the educated elite of his day (as Greek was to Romans in the late Republic)\n\n2)The assassination occurred prior to the birth of Christ, let alone his betrayal. Calling Brutus Judas would be nonsensical, and likely make them believe that Caesar's mind was deteriorating. \n\n3)Caesar would have been unable to get up to sing about his betrayal, given that he was a tad busy being dead.\n\n\n&gt;I conquered Gaul without a sweat\n\nWhat were the Gallic Wars?\n\nTo take a random qoute from chapter 40 of book 7 of Commentarii de Bello Gallico:\n\n 'Caesar felt great anxiety on this intelligence, because he had always especially indulged the state of the Aedui, and, without any hesitation, draws out from the camp four light-armed legions and all the cavalry: nor had he time, at such a crisis, to contract the camp, because the affair seemed to depend upon dispatch.'\n\nNot exactly someone who isn't sweating about the situation. More than that, if Caesar had not sweated during the entire campaign, it is liable he would have died. Humans are meant to sweat.\n\n\n&gt;I got this country out of debt,\n\n\nI'll admit, I don't know enough off hand about the economics of late republican rome, but, if memory serves me correctly, Caesar's economic reforms were to the Cura Annonae and the movement of plebs/colonists out of rome and across italy. While large amount of wealth was brought it, if memory serves, it largely helped pay off Caesar's own debts and was granted to the poor, instead of dealing with any 'national debt' in the modern sense.\n\nIn addition to this, I would like to note that Caesar was not tied to a wooden board to have knives thrown him while Mark Antony sang.\n\n\n&gt;I can't believe you stabbed me in the back\n\nCaesar was not stabbed in the back. To quote Suetonius:\n\n'Tillius Cimber, who had assumed the lead, came nearer as though to ask something; and when Caesar with a gesture put him off to another time, Cimber caught his toga by both shoulders; then as Caesar cried, \"Why, this is violence!\" one of the Cascas stabbed him from one side just below the throat. Caesar caught Casca's arm and ran it through with his stylus, but as he tried to leap to his feet, he was stopped by another wound. When he saw that he was beset on every side by drawn daggers, he muffled his head in his robe, and at the same time drew down its lap to his feet with his left hand, in order to fall more decently, with the lower part of his body also covered. And in this wise he was stabbed with three and twenty wounds, uttering not a word, but merely a groan at the first stroke, though some have written that when Marcus Brutus rushed at him, he said in Greek, \"You too, my child?\" '\n\n\n&gt; You know you might as well have put me on the rack,\n\nThis is, actually, correct. In as much as the rack did exist then. \n\n\n&gt;You even ruined my favorite shirt\n\nA toga is not a shirt.\n\n\n&gt;If I'd known that you were traitors,  You'd been killed by gladiators And then fed to alligators, as a snack,\n\nGiven that Caesar repeatedly tried to stress his mercy by leaving his enemies alive? Conspirators would have likely just been exiled. Even if put to death, its unlikely they would have been used as a gladiatorial spectacle.\n\n\n&gt; I was healthy, I did yoga,\n\nQuestions on Caesar's physical fitness aside, while Yoga did exist at the time, it was not exported to the west till the 20th century. While it's remotely possible that Yoga, or a practitioner of Yoga could have arrived in late Republican Rome, it's unlikely that Caesar would be a practitioner of the art. At least, in the Indian sense.\n\n\n**Sources**\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yalta_Conference\n\nhttps://www.loc.gov/law/help/us-treaties/bevans/m-ust000003-1005.pdf\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Et_tu,_Brute%3F\n\nhttp://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/suetonius/12caesars/julius*.html\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallic_Wars\n\nhttp://classics.mit.edu/Caesar/gallic.7.7.html\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rack_(torture)\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga#History\n",

        "text": "I'm no classically trained historian just a guy who likes folk and punk and other protest songs. Please correct me if I am wrong on anything! \n\nThe Video in questionhttps:www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLc5QJsMgvw\n\nThe first piece of bad history is simply calling Yankee Doodle an American protest song. Later adopted by American troops yes, but the way we know it is mocking of Americans and their poor manners and ill attempts to copy British tradition\n. \nTraditions place its origin in a pre-Revolutionary Warsong originally sung by British military officers to mock the disheveled, disorganized colonial \"Yankees\" with whom they served in the French and Indian War, apparently written c. 1755 by British Army surgeon Dr. Richard Shuckburgh while campaigning in upper New York.\n\n\"In the 1920s electrical music recording devices changed the way music was created allowing for more complex melodies and lyrics\"\n\nWew lad. So apparently complex music and lyrics didn't exist before then. That's a major issue but not what I'm here to discuss. What I’m here to talk about is the major jump between the 1770s and the 1930s\n\n\nSo civil war song protest songs exist. Johnny I hardly knew ye, Song of the Abolitionist. Slave spirituals, The Hutchinson Family Singers. They all exist and we're pretty important in the history of musical tradition, protest or not. Perhaps more than that is the Little Red Book and Joe Hill. Labor union hymns and working class anthems pervaded all of American music. To make such a massive jump is little disingenuous \n\n“After World War Two Folk Music became popular through the radio” \n\nFolk music had always been popular in America, thus FOLK! Aside from that, Woody Guthrie actually gained his massive popularity in 1940 with “This Land is Your Land”. Before that he had tons of music documenting the struggles of living in the west, a radio show, and a syndicated column. All of this before 1945. He even gained some popularity during the 1940s writing pro WWII music. I’ll link some below just because I like it. \n\n“This music was popular and went on to inspire musicians like Bob Dylan” \n\nNot technically wrong, but again, massive jump. Between the end of WWII and the start of Bob Dylan’s career, hundreds of folk groups formed and disseminated around the nation. Josh White, an African American protest singer even performed at Roosevelt’s inauguration! Bob Dylan although important to protest music, barely scratches the surface of these issues and important protest artists of the time. In fact his career as a protest singer lasted around 5 years only. \n \nI don’t know enough about Nina Simone and the 70’s seem mostly on point, until he blames it all on Kent State. Vietnam protest music was still very prevalent at the time, and Second Wave Feminism also had a ton of impact. Gross simplification again. I am slightly salty Gil Scott-Heron was not included.\n\nThey then proceed to cover the 1980s and 1990s as one focused solely on class. Then the proceed to not even mention traditional hardcore punk music. What the hell. MTV was not some revolutionary music force. These years had Dead Kennedys, Reagan Youth, Bad Brains, Black Flag, Circlejerks, and many many many more. These were key to the evolution of protest music, especially if they want to bring up Green Day later.  I am very glad they included riot grrl especially Sleater-Kinney my personal favorite. They also are on point with rap being political.\n\nNow they say there wasn’t much directed music in the early 2000s, apparently Rock Against Bush! REM, and even Bruce Springsteen didn’t exist in this time or put together a coherent voice. To say there wasn’t a large hatred against Bush in music is pure revisionism. \n\nCan’t disagree with Obama’s presidency honestly, but the music addressing those issues still existed, it just wasn’t front and center. \n\nThat’s my take on Vox Pop history, I leave you all with my favorite protest song Fuck Donald Trump by YG https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkZ5e94QnWk\n\nIn all seriousness for some good modern day little known protest music I recommend Of Ballots and Barricades by Ramshackle Glory\n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/books/first/m/margolick-fruit.html\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protest_songs_in_the_United_States\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Guthrie#1940s:_Building_a_legacyhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_political_punk_songs\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yankee_Doodle",

        "text": "Greetings bad history! Long time lurker, first time poster.\n\nWhile this might be a tad too pedantic, while listening to ['The Sound of Stalin'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHZQXNe2HpQ) , I couldn't help but notice a few of the inaccuracies. Seeing as, as far as I can tell, no one has judged this exact scene before, I may as well have a go.\n\n\n&gt;1928-1953\n\nAssuming this is meant to be Stalin's career, it is incorrect.\n \nHe was General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1922 till 1952. While Stalin retained the power of the position till his death, the position itself was abolished at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.\n\nStalin's position, till 1953, when then that of Chairman of the Council of Ministers, which he had taken up in 1941.\n\n\n&gt; Big Brother plots that would make Orwell blush\n\n\nConsidering how 1984 was written in 1944, as a criticism of the authoritarian nature of Stalinism and its corruption of Socialism, that's hardly surprising. Regardless, the song makes it imply that Stalin's level of plots are post facto, and are beyond Orwell's work, when the majority of them occurred prior to the work's creation, and later publishing in 1949.\n\n\n&gt;Spying on Lenin and murdering Trotsky\n\n\nWhile these are things that occured under Stalin, the introduction to the song shows it occuring in 1944. Lenin died in 1924, and Trotsky was killed in 1940. One could argue that the show is merely refering to everything that happened in Stalin's career. However, the show clarifies that at the start of the song as being '1928-1953', which would still exclude the moves against Lenin prior to his death in the timeframe that the song is working with.\n\n\n&gt;When the Germans head for Moscow, and the weather's vile, I simply look on as they all freeze to death,\n\nAside from the implication that the snow and winter did all the work for them, having a nervous break down for a few days (if you trust Molotov and Khrushchev) is hardly 'simply look on'.\n\n&gt;Feasting like Ivan while serfs live on rations\n\nTsar Alexander II might like a word, considering how he abolished serfdom in 1861 (or 1866 for those on imperial lands).\n\n&gt;Building a wall down the streets of Berlin,\n\nThe wall didn't go up till 1961. Zombie Stalin stole undead Hitler's architecture plans, it seems.\n\nOther than that, the song is alright.\n\n\n**Souces**\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Secretary_of_the_Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Trotsky\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_reform_of_1861 \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Wall\n\n \n**edit**\n\nIt appears I was incorrect with the title. This is, in fact, from Histeria!\n\n",

        "text": "So I noticed [this thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/6c4xi5/the_arab_muslim_slave_trade_of_africans_the/ ) , full of bad history nuggets, while scrolling through r/all. If it looks familiar, that’s because the same documentary was posted a few months ago, and inspired its own badhistory post [here]( https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/5lshx1/the_muslim_slave_trade_was_much_larger_lasted/). The documentary in question was reposted the other day, and while the documentary is the same, the comments are a whole new well of badhistory. \n\nIf you have time, I recommend you glance through the whole thing—it’s all pretty cringe worthy. But rather than dispute all the comments (which have gems like Q: why did Africa never develop industry? A: because tribalism). I will dispute the answer to what was the [top comment]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/6c4xi5/the_arab_muslim_slave_trade_of_africans_the/dhs48g3/) when I glanced through the thread: \n&gt; Why is everyone enslaving Africans?\n&gt; &gt; They were undeveloped, easy to exploit once the great powers developed industry. \n\nLet’s start with the low hanging fruit. By great powers, I’m just gonna assume this guy means white powers, because that’s almost always the case. The European Industrial Revolution kicked off in the mid 18th century, about a thousand years after the Islamic slave trade in Africa really got going. So I’m not sure why the industrialization of Europe has anything to do with why the Islamic slave trade targeted Africa. \n\nIt bears pointing out, of course, that the Islamic slave trade did not exclusively target Africans; many Eastern and Southern Europeans were also targeted by Mediterranean slave traders. However, as Sweet (1997) points out, Europeans could often be ransomed back to their families and countries, leading to the predominance of Africans in enslaved populations, even if they weren’t the only people being targeted. \n\nMore broadly, the reasons for the slave trade targeting these regions mix the theological with the practical. The Koran actually places strictures on who could be enslaved, and why. Chief among these restrictions was that Muslims, or protected members of non-Islamic faiths who payed the jizya, could not be enslaved. While an enslaved person would not necessarily be freed if he or she converted to Islam while being enslaved, a Muslim could not be enslaved in the first place. \n\nWhile the Koran accepts the practice of slavery (as does the bible—this is a function of the time in which the book was written), it advocated for a proper treatment of enslaved persons. Enslaved persons had legal rights, and had recourse to courts. While many of these protections came from other bodies of Islamic law, and not just the Koran, the Korean makes it clear that manumission was a pious act.  As a results, manumission was much more common in the Islamic world than it was in other circumstances, such as American plantation slavery. \n\nThese two factors provided the impetus to the Islamic slave trade: a constant need for new enslaved populations, as they often didn’t stay enslaved in the Islamic world, and a need for a source of enslaved persons outside the Islamic world. Africa provided the convenient answer to those problems, and as a result ~18 million Africans were exported by sea from the coasts of East Africa, or north via the Sahara from West Africa. \n\nThis is why the Islamic world targeted Africa for the slave trade. It was convenient. It’s not because Africans had “tribal societies” (whatever that means), because they were “undeveloped,” or any of the stories the viewers of documentaries like this like to tell themselves to make their cultures feel superior. \n\nSources: \n\n* B.

And so it will be for us. We are heading that way at an ever faster pace. We have not learnt from history. It will all end in tears.\n\n***R5:*** This is not considered one of the reasons why the Roman Empire fell (either that, or it was not very significant) - the 18th century historian Edward Gibbon, in his book *The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire* said this: \n\n&gt; The story of its ruin is simple and obvious; and, instead of inquiring why the Roman empire was destroyed, we should rather be surprised that it had subsisted so long. The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military government was relaxed, and finally dissolved, by the partial institutions of Constantine; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.\n\nTo put it simply, internal decline and invasions by outsiders were responsible for its fall.",

        "text": "So, Civ, that game we love to play and love to hate. Ah how you breed the best and the worst of us. Lately, in a thread about the Byzantines, it seems Edward Gibbon is miraculously resurrected with a profound knowledge in the art of redditeering.\n\nLet’s begin!\n---\n&gt;[Justinian and Basil II were not romans. If anything, both of them should be an alternative leader for Macedonia or Greece, because they had much more in common to them than to the romans.](https://np.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/69m9bq/if_they_decide_to_add_a_byzantine_civ_i_hope_it/)\n\n**TIL** I learned Trajan was selected as Civ VI leader for Rome because he was born not just in heartland Italy but nay, because he was literally born exploding out from under the marble tile floor of the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus thus emphasizing his divine given mandate of rulership over the Roman people. \n\nFirst, congrats to the quoted for knowing Justinian was from Macedonia. Secondly, the quoted commenter should know that other than a frivolous attempt to build a city near his birthplace, that's basically the end of commonality between Macedonia and Justinian.\n\nFrom an in-game perspective, it’s delusional to think there's a method to the madness that leaders are chosen for a civ other than that pop culture associates that person to said civ. \n\nThirdly, there's that vestigial cancer of Gibbon. The idea that the Roman Empire was some great homogenous state with modern citizenship identification based on race and ethnicity. Modern Byzantinist historians like Averil Cameron in her *The Byzantines*, Anthony Kaldellis’ *Hellenism in Byzantium* and Gill Page’s *Being Byzantine* have spent too much effort wasted debunking this idea that I'll keep it short.\n\nThe answer is… **NO**, in actual fact. They *were* Romans. Because 'Roman' wasn't a neatly defined term designed by magistrates in Antiquity for the purpose of people two thousand years better being able to wrap their heads around the (apparently difficult) idea that being a Roman was a complex and evolving state of identity. You certainly didn't have to be born in Italy to be considered a Roman in late Antiquity. People in the Roman East didn't suddenly get birth certificates informing them of their un-Romaness after 476 either.\n\n---\n\nOf course, heroes exist, and they appear in this thread. This hero said everything I ever could have wanted someone to say in response to top-upvoted horseshit like that.\n&gt;I mean, Trajan was born in Spain. He had a very different culture than Augustus, who had a very different culture than Philip the Arab (Syrian), who had a very different culture than Septimus Severus, who was born in northern Africa. Yet we all consider them \"Roman\" because they ruled the Roman State. Truth be told, any empire that survived as long as the Roman state did and covered as much territory as the Romans did was going to have many different cultures living within, and that was true of many different emperors who ruled what we consider to be the Roman Empire proper.\n&gt;And Byzantium isn't the same as a Russians claiming to be the next Rome. They split the empire in half to make it easier to govern. It was the direct continuation of the same state, not just someone who fancied themselves as Romans.\n\n\n[What an articulate and soothing balm of a response!](\nhttp://i.imgur.com/orZCO56.png)\n\nSo lets see what Mr. Makedonia says in return:\n\n&gt;Dunno about\n\n&gt;&gt;Yet we all consider them \"Roman\"\n\n&gt;Because their ethincity is common knowledge.\n\n&gt;Just look at the amount of butthurt caused by the fact, that Egypt leader is Cleopatra, which is greek.\n\nAh, the “IDK WTF is going on so I’ll change the topic to be about PCness and SJWs” gambit. *Love iT!*\n\nHe is right about Trajan’s background being common knowledge. Except Trajan’s Ibero-Hispanic origins (aka non-Italian aka therefore 'non-Roman’ by his definitions) was pretty well known. There are theories of ancestral Italian blood based on his gens Ulpia being derived from the Umbrian dialect of ‘lupus’ or wolf, but the Ulpia gens had been in Italica, Hispania since the 1st century BCE, so for all intents and purposes, Trajan was indeed of Ibero-Hispanic descent and he certainly was viewed as such and as both a non-Italian and a provincial. According to Cassius Dio, he was viewed with disgust as ‘an Iberian, and neither an Italian nor even an Italiot' **[Julian Bennett. *Trajan: Optimus Princeps.* pp1-3]**\n\n---\nAlso his next line is the clincher:\n&gt; It's not such a controversy with Trajan I guess, because he was actually a pretty great Emperor.\n\nL. So Justinian and Basil II weren’t ‘pretty great Emperors?’ \n\nThis particular lolcow, whose first comment is the top rated in the thread, is just full of *win* quality statements like these.\n\n&gt;**1]** As far as many different cultures living within, this is exactly why Byzantine Empire is a different Civilization compared to Roman Empire.\n\nWrong. Easiest is pointing to the early Byzantine Empire, which is fair ground here because he considers the starting of un-Romaness to be basically 476 it seems.\n\nThe Byzantine Empire was a multicultural one. In its pre-7th century form, this is obvious without explanation, but the interesting thing to note that this remains true even in its Balkan-Anatolic form of latter years. Some modern day Byzantinists like Cameron of Oxford University even challenge the true extent of the ‘Greekness’ of the empire because *‘this can reasonably be applied to the language of education, court and high literature but is far from doing justice to Byzantine society as a whole’* since for an empire who’s outward cultural image is concretely established, the Byzantine population was actually incredibly mixed. **[Averil Cameron. *The Byzantines.* p15]**\n\nSyriac culture thrived in Byzantine Mesopotamia, there was an substantial Armenian population in Cilicia and the eastern Anatolic themes. The Avars and Slavs that invaded the Balkans led to many settling in Byzantine territory and continuous back and forth between Byzantium and the invading neighbours that plagued it led to large amounts of population diffusion and intermingling. There was a very sizeable amount of Muslim immigrants who travelled to settle in Anatolia and ended up eventually in Byzantine territories. A large Hebrew population was know to have been well established by the time of the 12th and 13th centuries. \n\nNormally, the albeit large, but isolated and fringe nature of these communities with the Greek core would leave no doubt there was base level cultural stratification and that the empire wasn’t cohesively multicultural. Except for the fact that the emperors and the Byzantine state initiated large scale internal population exchanges to combat depopulation in areas considered ‘Greek core' by infusing them with these fringe populations. For example, Constantine V tackled depopulation in Constantinople itself by bringing in populations into it and Thrace from the east and in another example, similar depopulation in Lacedaemonia (the region where Sparta is located) was solved with transferring pops from Byzantine Armenia. Military campaigns in Syria caused large numbers of Muslims to flee and settle into Byzantine territory.\n\n---\nThe OP in this thread is frankly the greatest hero there.\nHe said largely the same things I would’ve, and welp. Downvoted. Meanwhile, Sir. Common Knowledge responds with his usual repertoire.\n\n&gt;**2]** So basically you're saying that \"Yeah, everything has changed and evolved, but they are still Romans, because they called themself as such back in the day.\"\n\n&gt;Roman and Byzantine cultures are very different. From architecture and iconography, to social and spiritual values.\n&gt;Of course Greek language was important in the Roman Empire. Greece as well as Ptolemaic Egypt were part of Roman Empire FFS. But it doesn't mean that any country that currently speaks Greek is a successor to the Roman Empire. Quite the opposite.\n\n&gt;Orthodox Christianity is extremely different to Catolic Christianity.\n\nYou guessed it! Flanderization! As a veteran in Reddit, he is very skilled in this masterclass skill of academia. His *genious* brings the question of why, u/Boscolt, why, did I waste my time writing theses when I could’ve just twisted the words of contemporary historiography to fit my motives?\n\nI’ll give it a try right now: *TIL because everything has changed and evolved from medieval England to modern England, English people today are not English even if they call themselves English. Also because Protestantism is extremely different to Catolic Christianity.*\n\nThe interesting thing is he uses evolve and change yet thinks Roman and Byzantine are clear cut separate. Using my example earlier, medieval England is to modern England what the classical Roman Empire is to the **medieval Roman Empire**.\n\nThe reason Byzantinists use the term ‘Byzantine’ isn’t to establish the Byzantines as a separate civilization but because it had been deeply entrenched by Gibbonist thinking and they thought it would be better to re-appropriate it to give the field a easier label for discussion. The reason why its difficult to find consensus in historiography to determine the start of the ‘Byzantine Empire,’ whether 330, 410, 476, 610 … is because Byzantinists know its difficult to pinpoint a start to an empire that didn’t appear suddenly but developed over centuries of change and transition.\n\n---\n&gt;**3]** In what fucking way \"ethnicity\" is anachronistic? Do you want to say, that every ethnic group inside the Roman Empire, such as Germani, Gauls, Iberians and many more are ethnically Romans just because they were part of the Empire?\n\nLol. I know there’s people who might comment that this guy maybe just thinks the West is Roman in response to the topic of Trajan, but nope! Apparently he believes being Roman was a race or an ethnicity in the modern nationalist tense and appears to solely confine it to Italy. The lolcows are coming home strong tonight. TIL the Roman Empire fell in the 2nd century because a non-Roman became emperor. Who knew Gibbon wrote and coined \"the Five Good Emperors” instead of “the Five Good *Roman* Emperors” because that was when Rome fell? Must be why its the first and only topic in his *~~Decline and~~ Fall of the Roman Empire* one-page publishing.\n\n---\n\nAt this point I’d love to say “that’s all she wrote”, but they keep going on and on. So while the tragicomedy doesn’t seem like stopping, I must.\n\nAlso as a Civ player, while I agree with much of OP’s comments, I’d have to say I don’t necessarily agree with his thread post. I think Civ is, as said in this title, a *game* with merely a history theme. Byzantium is a continuation of Rome, but it should have its own Civ because of the rule of fun. \n\nCiv is an interesting game in that it breeds two type of history buffs. There are those that take the historical trivia presented in the game, become interested in them, and commit to further independent study and research. Also plentiful are those who learn the extent of history in the game, proclaim *“OMG learned more history from Civ than school/college”* and make that the extent of their depth in the field. ",

It's been locked, also I've gotten in trouble for posting it over at the lovely ShitWheraboosSay, because I misread a rule. Remember to read rules carefully, don't be me! Also The Myth of the Eastern Front is pretty big on discussing popular historiography, and while I don't think Rule 2 bans discussion of historiographical trends within the past 20 years, I'm not 100% on that. Also big props to /u/breads_labyrinth for helping to set the record straight, you did some good work in the thread.\n\n[The image in question](http://img00.deviantart.net/ba88/i/2015/057/b/5/rwby_und_panzer_by_dishwasher1910-d8jlzp6.png)\n\nFor the pedantic/curious, Ruby's (far right) uniform appears to be some form of SS, Weiss' (far left) an SS Panzerdivision, Blake's (center left) a Wehrmacht Panzerdivision, and Yang's (centre right) is too cut up to tell. Credit to a commenter in the original thread for that. They're also missing a crew member for the Pz.IV in the background, and the shell is completely the wrong dimensions for the Kwk. 40. But this isn't about the image. Not that it's not awful, but it's not outright nazi apologia. Perhaps glorification of the Nazis.\n\nNote that the artist states under the image \"...and NO , they are NOT nazis , just black german uniforms\" which is interesting because the [Imperial Germans wore Feldgrau (center in the image)](https://www.1999.co.jp/itbig35/10355894b.jpg), the [West Germans wore Olive Drab](http://leopardclub.ca/LeopardLists/2-refs/images/Tamiya-news-8.jpg), and the [East Germans wore Strichtarn or Steingrau](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/19/24/4a/19244a3414b3afc7b395484eef45d361.jpg). The only [black German Tanker uniforms which come to mind are the Nazis!](http://i653.photobucket.com/albums/uu255/chau2208/item%20probuiltmodel/FIGURE/1-35%20German%20tank%20crew%201944-45%20-%202/Waffen-SSPanzerofficer_zps6d9aada8.jpg) Funny that...\n\nA note about the bibliography, I would normally cite individual passages, however for at least three of them (The two of Bartov's and Smelser's) the whole book is centered around the problem of Nazi apologia and/or their crimes on the Eastern Front.\n\nThe bad history is generally of the clean Wehrmacht variety, which is depressing. There's some St Rommel too. Let's get our examples, which will be briefly Rule 5'd, and then a larger summary speaking to the general problem at the end, adapted from an essay I wrote this semester partially on the issue of the popular historiography of the Nazi military.\n\n****\n\n&gt;judging by the lack of the lightning looking S's and lack of skulls on the hats, they're only Wermach [sic], who were NOT NAZIES [sic].\n\nSuffice it to say that, as Bartov points out again and again and again in *Hitler's Army* the Wehrmacht were absolutely a deeply Nazi organization. A Passage on page 147 is particularly illumating. \n\n&gt;\"The most striking aspect of the soldiers' letters is the remarkable similarity between their terminology, modes of expression, and argumetns and those which characterize the Wehrmact's [Nazi] propaganda. In complete contradiction to Mommsen's above quoted assertion [\"...The mentality of the average *landser* was characterize by soberness, rejection of the farfrom-reality propaganda tyrades, and by a firm will personally to survive...\" quoted on *ibid* p.146], the fact that these men, who were indeed closer than any of the propagandists to the reality of the war, saw and described it through the distorting lenses of the regime's ideology, is the true measure of the extent to which they had been bade into Hitler's soldiers in the most profound sense of the term, that is, that they percieved reality at the front just as he did in the safety of his bunker, sharing his fantasies of conquest and grandeur, of racial genocide and Germanic world rule. In fact, even those soldiers who expressed criticism of the Nazi regime were infected by the Nazi vocabulary.\"\n\nBartov then goes on to show this with several dozen pages of quoted and paraphrased letters, which I can quote if requested, though honestly you really should just read the book. It's quite good. \n\n****\n\n&gt;Your incorrect, the generals of the Wehrmacht tried numerous times to assassinate Hitler due to numerous things, such as him trying to tell the military exactly how to do something and in doing so destroying any hope of winning the war. Not to mention that the generals still weren't completely fine with fascism and the Nazi rhetoric. For example the Heer took a disliking toward the Waffen SS due to them being a wing of the party and despite saying that they'd work alongside the Heer they did they're own thing, such as commiting war crimes without the Heer command knowing about it.\n\nThis is patently false. See Bartov, I'm quoting from p. 64, but literally both Bartov books and the Smelser are relevant in almost their entirety.\n\n&gt;\"...[I]n the case of the Wehrmacht the situation was further complicated by the underlying ideological determinants of its own disciplinary system, as well as by the criminal activities of the SS in areas directly under the army's control which, however, not only did it lack the authority to stop, but was in fact expected to support both practically and morally.\"\n\nWith regards to the attitudes of the generals, reference might be made to Smelser, chapter three, in its entirety, the summation of which would be that the German officer corps post war, under the leadership of Fritz Halder, made an active effort to deny, minimize, distort and erase any evidence of their cooperation with the Regime in war planning, culpability in war crimes, and generally whitewash the German officer corps, in direct contradiction of reality. For evidence of this, let us turn to Bartov, where he cites Wermacht officers enthusiastically calling for the extermination of 'political and racial undesirables' throughout chapter 3, with especial attention to the quotes on pages 68, 73, 75, 77-80, 84-86, and there's more but honestly I'm just quoting the whole fucking chapter at this point. \n\n****\n\n&gt;German=/= Nazi ffs\n&gt;sigh\n&gt;I know it's an often used thing because the propaganda at that time is still affecting people, but still.......It's an insult to the german soldiers who died in that war.\n\nJust as the Nazis often inverted reality in their propaganda, blaming the barbarity and subhumanity of the Jews and Slavs for the German brutality towards them, this poster is describing the Wehrmacht, a deeply nazi organization, as apolitcal, and the truth, that the wehrmacht was a deeply nazi organization, is propaganda.\n\nFrom Bartov, Pg. 29 \"...because it [the fighting in the Soviet Union] revealed the inherent dynamic of serving as the military instrument of the Nazi regime. Ultimately, not even the remotest and most isolated elements of the German armed forces could remain completely immune to this process [of nazification.\"\n****\n\n&gt;As long as you get it....one has to understand that the soldiers in the field weren't \"Nazis\", they were german soldiers who defended their country from the armies that were waging war with it like any other soldier would do for their country. To metion them in the same breath as those ideology driven criminals and murderers is to spit on their grave and have a party on it......\n\nI'm not saying that the bulk of the Wehrmacht were either committed nazis or subscribed to the Nazi world view. They said that themselves. See the citation above for Bartov, chapter 3, and the section beginning on page 147.\n\n****\n\n&gt;Why do none of you every bring up the fact the German Wehrmacht and Party were at each other's throats throughout the war? By no means was every German, especially in the military a Nazi because he swore a stupid oath to an idiot with a stupid mustache.\n\nSame as above for R5.\n\n****\n\n[In responce to a comment regarding Blake, who is a faunus, i.e. people with an animal trait who an an in-universe expy for oppressed minorities.\n\n&gt;I'm imagining that they're fighting with Rommel, who, like Patton wouldn't give a fuck if you were glowing and looked like a sectoid as long as you could fight well.  \n&gt;Patton to a group of black soldiers \"I don't think you boys could fight well, prove me wrong\" That was meant more as a motivator than it was racist, and it worked\n\nPatton's views on race are the subject of another discussion, and while the extent of Rommel's commitment to the Nazi party and ideology can be debated, (though I would argue the debate is between \"he was a nazi\" and \"he was an enthusiastic nazi\" he certainly wasn't loath to the support he was given. Also he was a shit general, but I believe that's been covered [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1x6ny0/rommel_did_nothing_wrong_appears_in_the_most/) and [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/20pn2r/dae_rommel_wasnt_a_nazi_but_a_gentleman/) quite well.\n\n****\n\n&gt;True, I'm not defending them and saying that none of them were in favor of what happened, because a lot of them absolutely were. But if we stop showing nazi soldiers because of what war crimes nazi soldiers have done... we should stop doing the same for American soldiers.\nThe Americans did quite a few war crimes throughout history as well, especially massacres in non-combatant forces, like prisoners or civils.\nIt's just that, for me, the crimes that the soldiers have commit is less important than people who have organised massacres and created the things to do the war crimes (for exemple, those who created the idea of the final solution). And, the fact that they were in war makes it more bearable, add opposed to a hate group that did murders and other atrocities while in a time of peace.\n&gt;Maybe because I've read a lot of things about war atrocities, about propaganda, about the effects of social pressure and all that stuff, I can more easily get over it, I don't know. I'm not saying that they did nothing wrong, because they absolutely did. But... I don't care about having RWBY being dressed as German soldiers. Why? Because as I said somewhere else, for me they are simply being dressed in uniforms. \n&gt;They could have been dressed in American uniform, in English uniform, or whatnot. But nazi Germany uniforms (especially the officers) is one of the best looking uniform there ever was, so that's why they are drawn like this, for the rule of cool. They are not drawn to promote something, they are drawn to look badass as fuck\n\nMAN YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE? SAYING TWO THINGS WHICH AREN'T EQUAL ARE! Also because soldiers are committing war crimes makes it ok! Personally I'm not a fan of the black leather and jackboots look, but YMMV. It looks too showy to me, it doesn't have the simplistic practicality of the US, UK, and Soviet uniforms. There's a lot of baggage to unload here.\n\n****\n\nIt was deleted, but someone posted [this](http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/109/346/ebc.png). So you don't have to look at it, it's a drawing of Yang, the character whose voice actress is Jewish, as a concentration camp victim curled up on the ground, with another character, Neo, with a boot on her head. And they said they were aroused by this. Feel free to gag a little. It's not quite bad history, per-se, but \"masturbating to camp inmates\" is certainly not a proper historiographical approach to remembering the Shoah. Honestly the thought that someone could find the holocaust sexually arousing makes me a little nauseous.\n\n****\n\nSo I took it upon myself to reply before the thread was killed, posting the following:\n\n&gt;So, this is absolute bullshit. The myth of the clean Wehrmacht has been disproven many times, notably by Omer Bartov's in Hitler's Army: Soldiers, Nazis, and War in the Third Reich and The Eastern Front 1941-45, German Troops and the Barbarization of Warfare.\n\n&gt;For information on how the understanding of the eastern front got that way read Ronald Smelser's The Myth of the Eastern Front: The Nazi Soviet War in American Popular Culture.\n\n&gt;The short story is that post-World War Two the ex-Nazi generals colluded to shift the narrative of the Eastern front from \"We got our asses handed to us by the Soviets after invading their country and conducting ourselves with a level of barbarism heretofore unprecedented in the history of warfare\" to \"We were defending europe from the ~~judeo-bolshevik~~ asiatic barbarian hordes\" which, and I can not stress this enough **IS TOTAL BULLSHIT**.\n\n&gt;Let me post some excerpts from my essay on the topic\n\n&gt;****\n\n&gt;The myth of the ‘Clean Wehrmacht,’ that the vast majority of the Nazi state’s soldiers were motivated out of blander German patriotism, rather than National Socialist fervor or a personal admiration of Adolf Hitler, is surprisingly persistent.^1 It is also demonstrably false. The academic orthodox historiography, thanks to works such as Omer Bartov’s The Eastern Front, 1941-1945, German Troops and the Barbarization of Warfare, has soundly rejected the Clean Wehrmacht narrative.\n\n\n&gt;From the end of the War to this day, the American popular historiography of the Eastern Front has, in part due to lack of access to Soviet sources, in part due to an overreliance on the Nazi account of the war, and in part out of cold-war rabid anticommunism, fallen hook line and sinker for the Nazi propaganda that the war on the Eastern Front of WWII was a patriotic effort against the Bolshevik hordes. In a parallel of the Lost Cause narrative, a concerted effort was made by former Wehrmacht and SS officers, in conjunction with the West German Government, to toe a ‘party line.’^3 They stressed \n\n&gt;“...Germans as honourable soldiers, Russians [here meaning Soviets in general] as the real savages, Wehrmacht commanders as the epitome of honour, Manstein cast in the mold of Hector of Troy… represent the core of the myth of the clean Wehrmacht.”^4\n\n&gt;That this all is a blatant lie is as indisputable as the lie is pervasive. The American general public, as well as academics such as Basil Liddell Hart and S.L.A. Marshall, either failed to understand the cultural context of the history they were reading, or actively ignored it.^5 Even the truly objective historian, a concept both as convenient and artificial as the physicist’s frictionless vacuum, would be hard pressed to create an accurate historiography of the Eastern Front, given that the sources available were almost exclusively from one side of the conflict, and were actively misrepresenting the extent to which Nazi ideology had permeated the German mentality. The faulty historiography of the war in Eastern Europe, the myth of the Clean Wehrmacht, was the result of a concerted effort to misrepresent the mentality of that conflict. It is only through recent cultural histories of the Wehrmacht, as well as of Clean Wehrmacht historiography itself, that movement has been made towards a more accurate understanding of the Eastern Front.\n\n&gt;1.

        "author": "taylororo",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/6c0jsx/professor_x_mlk_magneto_malcolm_x/",
        "text": "Humans are fans of historical analogies, - the most famous of which being \"Me = Churchill, You = Hitler, People who disagree with me = Chamberlain\" - but only slight less well known is that \"Professor X is, like, a stand in for Martin Luther King. Magneto is totally Malcolm X\".\n\nFor you losers who don't read comic books, the X-Men are a group of humans with mutant genes that give them super powers. Cyclops can shoot concussive blasts out of his eyes. Wolverine has super senses and a strong healing factor. Bailey Hoskins can explode but doesn't have a healing factor. They are led by Professor X, a bald dude who runs a school for mutants and can read minds.  Professor X's best friend and worst enemy is Magneto (pronounced \"Mag-nee-to\", not \"magnet-toe\"^1). Magneto, a total silver fox, is a mutant terrorist who leads the apply named \"Brotherhood of Evil Mutants\". \n\nIn the comics, normal humans hate and fear all mutants, not just the brotherhood. The legendary X-Men writer Chris Claremont [explains](https://web.archive.org/web/20131109071039/http:/www.screened.com/news/professor-x-and-magneto-allegories-for-martin-luther-king-jr-and-malcolm-x/2316/) the deal:\n\n&gt;The X-Men are hated, feared and despised collectively by humanity for no other reason than that they are mutants. So what we have here, intended or not, is a book that is about racism, bigotry and prejudice.\n\nAnd it's true the connection is obviously there. People feared for how they were born. So perhaps  unsurprisingly, there is a strong movement to claim that MLK = Prof. X,  Malcolm X = Magneto. \n\nHere is a [sample](http://geekandsundry.com/malcolm-x-and-magneto-comparing-history-to-fiction/) of the genre:\n\n&gt;They [creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby] created the X-Men and the ensuing conflicts were modeled after…you guessed it…Dr. King and Malcolm X. In this case, it was Professor X and Magneto — Magneto personifying the ideals of Malcolm X and his push for fighting fire with fire to achieve equality. Instead of fighting for African American rights, like Malcolm X and MLK, Professor X and Magneto fought for the rights of mutant kind.\n\nThis is bad history on two levels. First, I've never seen any evidence that Stan Lee and Jack Kirby modeled Magneto and Professor X after Malcolm X and MLK. When reading early X-men, Magneto is a fairly normal early Marvel villain with no redeeming qualities. In his first appearance, he takes over a US government missile base to do evil shit with. Though Stan Lee claimed in 2008 that he never thought of Magneto as a villain, the early appearances of the character are not a nuanced take on resisting oppression. Magneto names his terrorist group the Brotherhood of *Evil* Mutants, for Odin's sake.  Plus, Stan Lee is the least reliable narrator in the multiverse. I love the guy, but truth and fiction are not separate entities to him. If he really did think of Magneto as a conflicted anti-hero, he sure failed at expressing that. [These panels](http://imgur.com/a/rvqFn)  from X-Men #1 are just bad dudes being bad. Literally, one of the first things Mags says is: \n\n&gt;The human race no longer deserves dominion over the planet earth! The day of the mutants is upon us! The first phase of my plan shall be to show my power. . . to make homo sapiens bow to homo superior.\n\nTo further counter the claim that King and X was the basis for the duo, Chris Claremont, the legendary  writer who basically created the X-Men as we know them today, [explains](http://edition.cnn.com/2011/SHOWBIZ/Movies/06/03/xmen.legacy.go/) how his characters were not modeled after the King and Malcolm X [says]:\n\n&gt;“It was too close. It had only been a few years since the [Martin Luther King and Malcolm X] assassinations. In a way, it seemed like that would be too raw. My resonance to Magneto and Xavier was borne more out of the Holocaust. It was coming face to face with evil, and how do you respond to it? In Magneto’s case it was violence begets violence. In Xavier’s it was the constant attempt to find a better way. As we got distance from the ’60s, the Malcolm X-Martin Luther King-Mandela resonance came into things. It just fit.”\n\nIt does not fit. Admittedly, there are similarities between King and Profressor X. [This speech](https://images.moviepilot.com/images/c_limit,q_auto,w_710/svaltiiuturg2qjufr21/x-men-x-amination-what-makes-magneto-xavier-and-apocalypse-tick.jpg), except for the gay stuff, could come from King. But Professor X (real name: Charles Xavier) has some, let's call it \"peculiarities\", that set him apart from King. Namely, Xavier recruited a group of teens for the purpose of creating a paramilitary squad of highly trained soldiers to carry out vigilante justice. This extremely violent behavior and reckless endangerment of teenage life is not aligned with King's thinking. Where King was willing to face down government sanctioned violence using non-violent methods, Xavier's X-Men have a  different view on resisting the government - a view that involves lots and lots of [aweseome punching](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/65/bf/87/65bf87ecf8853968e89d4cae860ba0ae.jpg) and [electrocution](http://comicsalliance.com/files/2012/09/xmen07.jpg). \n\nInterestingly, Xavier's views on the use of defensive violence aligns much more closely with the words of Malcolm X:\n\n&gt;\"It doesn't mean that I advocate violence, but at the same time, I am not against using violence in self-defense. I don't call it violence when it's self-defense, I call it intelligence.\"\n\nLet's say Malcom X was born with claws and healing and then experimented on by the government. It's easy to believe that Malcolm Weapon X would fight against the robot sentinels sent to hunt down mutants alongside the other X-Men. \n\nAnother difference between King and Professor X is that King tried to appeal to white America's conscience through dramatic protests. A large part of Professor X's movement is centered on the belief that if mutants are \"respectable\" and shown to be trustworthy that mainstream America will accept him and other members of \"Homo Superior\". In the classic arc *Days of Future Past*, Xavier explains \"he's scared. We must teach him that his fears are unfounded\" and \"[the Brotherhood wanted] to teach humanity to fear and respect the power of homo superior. Their plan backfired. Mutants became objects of fear and hatred\". Basically, ol' Q-ball is promoting a concussive form of respectability politics. If only mutants are nice enough, mainstream humanity will stop associating all mutants with the radical extreme. \n\nIn contrast, King didn't run around trying to protect white America from the Brotherhood of Evil Negros for a couple of reasons. As mentioned, King would never organized a paramilitary group of child soldiers to police black people. Secondly,  King didn't believe that uniquely self-policing the black community was the path to civil rights, rather it was the awakening of the white conscience that was necessary. \n\nAnother point of difference is that King was trying to reform American institutions, not create his own. Along with his own private military police, Xavier created his own mutant-only school. The reasoning was that since humans were not ready to deal with mutants, [he must create his own](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/94/ProfX-XMen1.jpg/220px-ProfX-XMen1.jpg). While a reasonable method for dealing with a society of assholes, Xavier's work to create a separate institution for mutantkind is again aligned more with Malcolm X, who was more of an advocate for black self-sufficiency than King. \n\nIn the end, Professor X is kind of a grab bag of philosophies, only some of which align with King. \n\nOn to the other half of the analogy. Magneto is not Malcolm X - he is tragic, Magnet Hitler.  Magneto, born \"Max Eisenhardt\"  to Jewish parents in the 1930s, is the most famous Holocaust survivor in the Marvel Universe and probably in our universe too, now that I think about it. That's kinda sad that Magneto is more famous Elie Wiesel. I'm part of the problem though - I've never even read *Night*, yet here I am writing a huge post about the X-Men. Anyways, after World War II, Eisenhardt changed his name to Magnus for aesthetic reasons and then later to Eric Lensherr.  And after the deep trauma of the Holocaust, Magneto promised to use his powers to protect his people (\"his people\" being mutants, Mags doesn't seem to really care about Jews). \n\nBut here's the thing, in his quest to protect mutants he's turned himself into that Nietzsche quote about becoming a gaze monster while fighting gaze monsters in an abyss ([picture of Magneto fighting a gaze monster in an abyss](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uZBj4DMbCGQ/TxiKP-PVunI/AAAAAAAAAn0/Mg997M7ypKk/s1600/two-towers-balrog-gandalf.png)). For example, he conquers a South American country to create a homeland for mutants. Like a Xavier's school for gifted children, a mutant homeland might be an honorable goal, but Magneto relies on the subjugation of the human populace. That's the crux - Lensherr doesn't care about equality with you humans, only [domination](http://abload.de/img/mag3uoxis.jpg). Malcolm X wouldn't tear down mid-town [New York](https://marswillsendnomore.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/comicnut005.jpg), try to develop a genetic bomb that turns all white people black, or kidnap Ralph Albernathy to get information about Martin Luther King.  \n\nThe Magneto is Malcolm X analogy begins and ends with the idea that they want separation and their counterparts want integration. However, Magneto has repeatedly shown that he is less interested in separation than complete domination. We cannot separate Magneto's agressive violence from his core philosophy. The necessity of violence against homo sapiens is key to who he is. Removing violence from Magneto is absurd as add it to King's. \n\n[1] This joke was shamelessy stolen from *The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl*, which you should read *right friggin' now*\n",

If you start following links you'll always find this always ultimately ends back at one book\n\n**Hail to the Tat: an illustrated history of presidential tattoos**\n\nThis is an amazing book title and would sell a lot of copies...it also doesn't exist. \n\n[the ultimate source is, of course, yahoo answers](https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070716121119AAC0xDQ)\n\n&gt;  Best Answer:  Referencing the popular book, \"Hail to the Tat: An Illustrated History of Presidential Tattoos,\" 35 of the 43 presidents sported skin art. Amongst the First Citizen's tattoos, the most popular were on the arm, thus starting the tradition that no American President can be photographed wearing a tank top. The most famous tattoo involved a small eagle holding a broad sword (demonstrated in the first source) fighting Jack \"Galveston Giant\" Johnson. Additionally, several presidential tattoos stand out: Andrew Jackson sported a tomahawk that ran the length of the inside of his left leg; James K. Polk is historically known to be the first white man to have a Chinese character as a tattoo (the symbol for \"eager\"); James Buchanon with a scantily-clad brunette on his chest as well as the acronym \"BFL\" in six inch lettering on his abdomen (BFL standing for \"bachelor for life\"); and William McKinley with a cartoon representation of himself as the Monopoly man carrying a bulging sack with a $ symbol. \n\n&gt;source: [university of minnesota url that doesn't exist]\n\nI'm assuming this is a brilliant example of trolling. I mean who buys that McKinley would get a tattoo of the literal \"Mr Moneybags\" (**a character created 30 years after he was assassinated!** ^^according ^^to ^^wikipedia ^^^^^^don'tkillme )?!? ^1\n\nWhile the Teddy Roosevelt claim isn't here it seems to only exist in articles that reference the yahoo answers lie so i'm assuming it got slipped in. \n\n\n^^^^^^^\n\n\n\n^^^^^^^\n\n\n^1 McKinley famously is connected to Big Business. McKinley or Hanna (aka [Karl Rove 1.0](https://www.amazon.com/Triumph-William-McKinley-Election-Matters/dp/1476752966))'s campaign against Bryant in 1896 ***still*** holds the record for the [highest % of GDP spent on an election at 6 times 2008's %](http://enikrising.blogspot.com/2012/03/more-spending-on-presidential-elections.html)\n\n^2 \"Bachelor for Life\" Buchanan was indeed a bachelor. However, he was also credibly rumored to have a long time same sex relationship with Rufus King. Hence the overcompensating babe on his arm\n\n^3  Jack \"Galveston Giant\" Johnson was a Jim Crow era boxer (he's the guy who violated the Mann act). Now, we all know (from reputable sources) that Andrew Jackson lived through the Civil War but I'm not sure he stuck around through 1910. [I don't think I need to explain the Tamahawk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminole_Wars)\n\n^4 I have absolutely no idea why James K Polk is connected to China here. He's too late for me to make a specious connection to the panic of 1837. \n\n\n\n\n**************************\n\nOf course, the top post on a highly voted TIL just repeats the yahoo answers thing.\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/37somr/til_teddy_roosevelt_had_his_family_crest_tattoed/\n\n\n\ntl;dr \"The official Tumblr for the country's longest running history series, PBS's American Experience.\" ultimately used a yahoo answers troll as a legitimate source\n\n\n************\n\nhttp://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/2013/04/30/10-things-didnt-know-about-tattoos.html\n\n&gt; 5. Several U.S. presidents are rumored to have had tattoos, including Franklin Pierce and Dwight Eisenhower. Theodore Roosevelt, however, is confirmed to have had a family crest inked into his chest.\nFox News says \"it is confirmed\" that TR had a tat citing ABC \n\nhttp://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/09/tattooed-u-s-politicians/\n\n&gt;  President Theodore Roosevelt had his family crest tattooed on his chest.\n\n\nironically it's the great journalistic rag \"inkedmag.com\" which acknowledges this is only a rumor\n\nhttp://www.inkedmag.com/tattooed-presidents/\n\n\n&gt; The Roosevelt family crest is pretty awesome and would make for a great tattoo, so we are hoping that there is some truth to this rumor\n\nsimilar \"tattoohistorian.com\" just calls it a rumor. [Contrary to my expectations, this wasn't just a random blog. It is run by someone who got a PhD in 2012 from U Chicago on history of culture who has read deeply on the history of tattoos](http://independent.academia.edu/AnnaFelicityFriedman/CurriculumVitae). \n\nhttps://tattoohistorian.com/2015/10/20/justin-trudeau-joins-the-ranks-of-the-worlds-tattooed-leaders/\n\nShe doesn't hunt down the rumor's source but it really seems like 2007 yahoo answers is ultimately the culprit. \n\n******************************\n\n\nso ultimately some of the \"it's all 2007 yahoo answers\" is a bit speculative but i think it's clear the internet and multiple major media outlets have advanced badhistory based on the internet rumor mill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n********************\n\none more edit: I'm going to try and follow this path more directly. \n\n* Yahoo answers 2007\n\n* [ezinearticles.com](http://ezinearticles.com/?101-Tattoo-Facts&amp;id=3715908)-2010\n* [Urban Dictionary](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=James%20K.%20Polk)-July 2011 (for Polk)\n* [tattoos of history](https://historytattoos.tumblr.com/page/4) July 2011.

Shortly after they establish that they are indeed in an alternate timeline where Dunkirk was a slaughter instead of an evacuation.\n\n45min in is where the glaring badhistory comes in.  ME262!  With jet engines!  Three of them!\n\nAny ME262 flying at this point is pretty amazing badhistory, even allowing for the disaster at Dunkirk being the big timeline change.  The first test flights of the ME262 airframe weren't until 18 April, 1941.  Please note this was the airframe.  \n\nWhy is this important?  Possibly because the ME262 first flew using a nose mounted propeller.  The BMW 003 engines were uh.  Unreliable.  Even moreso than the later production use Jumo 004.  Both BMW 003 engines failed on the first flight.  Jet engines weren't successfully paired with the airframe and flight until 18 July 1942.  Line production delivery of the ME262 didn't even begin until June of 1944.  The first combat mission was flown in July.  \n\nMEINE WUNDERWAFFEN IST VIER JAHREN UBER ALLES!!!  Just the little things, you know?\n\nBUT WAIT THERE'S MORE!\n\nThe best part, in the vein of /u/Quouar:\n\nWEATHER BADHISTORY!!!\n\nNow, in the movie there's a bunch of jumping around geographically that doesn't make much sense.  Much talk of a \"western front\" in France that doesn't match much with reality.  However, based upon the plane witnessing the sinking of the HMS Lancastria (in Saint-Nazaire) and later mentioning Rennes, before moving on to eventually landing in modern-day Berlin ... I'm going to be lazy and use Paris.  \n\nSurprisingly, finding the weather report for Paris on June 17, 1940 isn't as easy as you'd think.  Not many hits on The Google for it that are useful, so hey let's just get a 1940's almanac!  Get whatever areas I can find to get a temp spectrum and then match current weather for Paris.  \n\nWell.  \"almanac 1940\" comes up with some pretty fucked up results.  Hit 2 is \"Holocaust Denial\" while 4 and 5 are Stormfront.  \n\nCrap.  Okay.  Let's try a different search: \"rennes france weather 1940\"\n\nThat leads me to:  http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/71/a6870071.shtml\n\nIt's a pretty neat first hand result by LT Grahame Nott-Macaire.\n\n\"We slept near by in whatever shelter we could find, washed and shaved in streams which were frequently on hand. The weather could not have been kinder to us. Beautiful early summer days and warm nights. This gypsy life was very little hardship at all.\"\n\nThen.  Why.  Why.  WHY!??! WARUM SIND MEINE DEUTSCHE UBERMENSCH SOLDATIN shown wearing their greatcoats?  Laziness?  Showing they're strong enough to wear winter clothing in summer, unlike the weak Allied troops?  We'll never know, since it was an alternate timeline and I guess an alternate map since this was all over the place geographically.\n\nAlso where a passenger plane airdropped their radar system to the British in France using a bunch of ponchos.\n\nSources: Wiki for the ME262 stuff timelines aren't exactly open to nuanced interpretation.",

        "text": "Welcome to the final part of my review of the Saxons 'documentary':\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuM4Auxml98\n\nThe good news is that I should be able to dedicate Sundays to continuing my reviews whilst working full-time and tutoring. The bad news is I still have to watch them. So let us finish this!\n\n21.08: Now we go to the north to see how the S̶t̶a̶r̶k̶s̶ Anglo-Saxons there are doing.\n\n21.16: ANACHRONISTIC SWORD! DRINK!\n\n21:19: \"At the beginning of the 7th century Æthelfrith dominates many of the surrounding Saxon chieftains, plundering their treasure, their crops, and especially their women”. I didn’t know they had Socialists back then. Also, according to the primary sources Æthelfrith never treated the Anglo-Saxons in his kingdom that way. Instead, Bede states:\n\n“At this time, the brave and ambitious king, Ethelfrid, governed the kingdom of the Northumbrians, and ravaged the Britons more than all the chiefs of the English, insomuch that he might be compared to Saul of old, king of the Israelites, save only in this, that he was ignorant of Divine religion”.\n\nSo he campaigned against Celtic Britons rather than against his own people. Additionally, a warlord who treated his own vassals in such a manner would lose their support very quickly, and so could hardly have engaged in taking over other kingdoms. DRINK!\n\n21.29: They are just having a Saxon peasant wear blue war-paint for absolutely no reason. DRINK!\n\n21.47: Another Saxon peasant with blue war-paint, which was the style of the time. DRINK!\n\n22.28: I love how this royal family just has dinner with no one apparently guarding their hall.\n\n22.47: Among the lesser known of Æthelfrith’s talents was to speak whilst keeping his mouth completely closed.\n\n23.33: The documentary has a woman as an expert, which is obviously an error as history is clearly a masculine academic pursuit. DRINK!\n\n25.28: That crown looks way too fake, but I don’t know enough about 7th century English ornamentation, so I will reserve a drink until another Redditor can clarify things.\n\n27.10: The narrator states Æthelfrith sent an ultimatum to Redwald to deliver Edwin to him. This is incorrect. Bede makes it clear Æthelfrith first tried bribery and assassination several times, and only threatened Redwald as a last resort. DRINK!\n\n27.22: Did they just pick out these costumes from a fancy dress store?\n\n29.00: ANACHRONISTIC SWORD! DRINK!\n\n29.18: Besides the blue war-paint, tactics appear to be just abandon any formation and charge widely. Also know as the “Braveheart Approach”. Warriors in this time period were not stupid. They knew they had to maintain a solid shieldwall as it vastly improved group survival and made commanding large bodies of troops easier. DRINK!\n\n29.52: THE SWORDS! THEY ARE GETTING WORSE! DRINK!\n\n32.08: “Take that, inanimate pagan ceremonial displays!”\n\n32.37: The narrator says a coalition of pagan Saxons kills Edwin. Bede states that one segment of the forces involves was led by Cadwalla, a Celtic Christian king. So whilst there was a pagan element that later attacked the Church, it hardly represented a coalition of anti-Christian powers on a pagan crusade. DRINK!\n\n32.52: So the scenes from 1300 years ago are in colour, but those from 80 years ago are sepia-toned??\n\n34.14: And another ahistorical blade. DRINK!\n\n34.53: The narrator states the Vikings threatened the bring the Anglo-Saxon way of life to a bloody end. This is so completely wrong I must laugh sarcastically. Ha ha ha. Whilst Vikings became a ruling class in some places, they left Anglo-Saxon communities intact and gradually assimilated into English society. DRINK!\n\n35.52: GAH! WHERE ARE THEY GETTING THESE SWORDS FROM! GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! DRINK!\n\n36.28: Oh. My. God. Guthrum’s helmet includes both a crown and Viking horns. This show has just reached a Dungeons and Dragons level of historical authenticity. DRINK!\n\n36.38: The second greatest ruler in history, Alfred of Wessex, has entered the stage\n\n36.52: This is blatantly inaccurate because Uhtred-Chan is not here to single-handedly win all his battles.\n\n37.30: I’m just gonna start ignoring these swords now.\n\n37.50: RAMBO KNIFE! DRINK!\n\n38.45: The belts the Wessex warriors are wearing seem recycled from the Roman outfits.\n\n40.21: Now the men of Wessex are wearing woad war-paint. DRINK!\n\n40.38: “Now my brothers, ignore sensible military doctrine and charge blindly with me!”\n\nAnd that is the last in this series I am reviewing. I cannot endure any more!\n\nSources\n\nAlfred the Great: War, Culture and Kingship in Anglo-Saxon England, by Richard Abels\n\nThe Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Part One: http://omacl.org/Anglo/part1.html\n\nEurope Between the Oceans: 9000 BC-AD 1000, by Barry Cunliffe\n\nEcclisiastical History of England, by Bede: https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html\n\nGermania, by Tacitus: \nhttps://archive.org/stream/tacitusagricolag00taciiala/tacitusagricolag00taciiala_djvu.txt\n\nHistory of the Britons, by Nennius: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/History_of_the_Britons\n\nHistory of the Kings of Britain, by Geoffrey of Monmouth: \nhttp://www.yorku.ca/inpar/geoffrey_thompson.pdf\n\nThe Ruin of Britain, by Gildas: http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1949/pg1949.html\n\nWarfare and Society in the Barbarian West 450-900, by Guy Halsall",

I will not fix the triviality complaint, but I hope this post is a little bit easier to follow.\n\nPlease note I am not a historian. My only qualifications for this post are a curmudgeonly heart and the willingness to expend slightly more than average effort in investigating trivial issues.\n\nThe core claim I wish to refute comes from an [Extra Credits video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-CW0B4YeBQ&amp;t=10s). Specifically the first 10 seconds, where they mention that the tongue twister “she sells sea shells” is a reference to Mary Anning. In brief, after more than a little searching I have found no evidence whatsoever for this claim. But don’t rush to blame EC - they come by this bit of dubious history honestly. And this particular claim has appeard in so many websites ([1](http://www.cracked.com/article_19248_6-uneducated-amateurs-whose-genius-changed-world.html) [2](http://www.macroevolution.net/mary-anning.html) [3](http://thegalleryofheroes.com/topic/Mary-Anning#cite_note-15) [4](http://www.neatorama.com/2011/06/29/2-true-and-2-false-origins-of-tongue-twisters-and-nursery-rhymes/) [5](http://www.mamalisa.com/?t=hes&amp;p=3445) [6](http://web.archive.org/web/20131008033448/http://www.factfixx.com/2012/06/20/tongue-twisters-she-sells-sea-shells/) [7](http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=41849) [8](http://qi.com/infocloud/mary-anning)).\n\nAnother quick note: I titled this post “dubious” history rather than “bad” history because I don’t actually have any evidence that the claim is *false*. But I hope to show there isn’t any evidence that it is *true* either, and I further hope to raise some reasonable doubts.\n\n*****\n\n# Background Information\n\nMary Anning lived from **1799-1847**. She undeniably sold sea shells by the seashore. Many of those seashells were fossilized, and it is Mary Anning’s work in finding fossils that she is remembered for. She did sell sea shells, though, in addition to finding other fossils.\n\nThe rhyme “she sells sea shells” appears to have originated as a song in **1908**. Unfortunately I don’t have any great sources for this (all webpages, I couldn’t track down any books). However it appears the [melody was written](http://www.fredgodfreysongs.ca/Collaborators/harry_gifford.htm) by one Harry Gifford (1876-1960), the words by a Terry Sullivan (???), and the song was originally sung by Wilkie Bard (1874-1944). It appears to have been sung in the US by Billy Murray (1954). I do have one reasonable source: the [National Library of Australia](http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/162422279?selectedversion=NBD48549880) has the [original newspaper advertisement](http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/28145239) for sales of the sheet music in Australia in 1909. So the song was certainly written before then!\n\nI could not find a birthdate for Terry Sullivan, but everyone else involved was born more than 20 years after Mary Anning died. So already the whole claim seems rather suspicious.\n\nHowever, do note that Mary Anning was somewhat well known (at least in geological circles) during her own lifetime. And she was written about periodically after her death, judging by [t](https://books.google.com/books?id=yfMlfIbOlUsC&amp;pg=PA262&amp;dq=mary+anning&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZyN_bo-rTAhXMKCYKHa7qCD4Q6AEIPjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=mary%20anning&amp;f=false)[h](https://books.google.com/books?id=0HMHAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=mary+anning&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZyN_bo-rTAhXMKCYKHa7qCD4Q6AEIOTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=mary%20anning&amp;f=false)[e](https://books.google.com/books?id=qtRhAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA197&amp;dq=mary+anning&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZyN_bo-rTAhXMKCYKHa7qCD4Q6AEIVDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=mary%20anning&amp;f=false)[s](https://books.google.com/books?id=K8YPAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA386&amp;dq=mary+anning&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZyN_bo-rTAhXMKCYKHa7qCD4Q6AEIWjAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=mary%20anning&amp;f=false)[e](https://books.google.com/books?id=RqK8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA116&amp;dq=mary+anning&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiYra7wo-rTAhXLKiYKHXxLB3M4ChDoAQgnMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=mary%20anning&amp;f=false) articles I found about her in Google Books (just be prepared to sift a little, as there was also a boat named Mary Anning). So it is not hard to believe that Terry Sullivan had heard of her, though I have no evidence that he did.\n\n*****\n\n# Follow the Sources!\n\nSeeing as [Wikipedia itself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Anning#Impact_and_legacy) makes the claim that the tongue twister refers to Mary Anning, I originally began this search by following Wikipedia’s sources. Wikipedia cites three sources: a [defunct website](http://www.factfixx.com/2012/06/20/tongue-twisters-she-sells-sea-shells/), [Forbes](https://web.archive.org/web/20160317223109/http://www.forbes.com/sites/shaenamontanari/2015/05/21/mary-anning-from-selling-seashells-to-one-of-historys-most-important-paleontologists/#3e0d246a5783) (who does not cite anyone, of course), and a book called “Henry de la Beche: observations on an observer” by Paul McCartney (not that one).\n\nI actually bought  [“HENRY DE LA BECHE: ooao,”](http://imgur.com/a/LKdRN) for **$17.06**. It is a reasonably well written biography of Henry de la Beche, on of the first paleontologists. It contains lots of pictures and plenty of sources, both of which are nice. Here is the entire passage relevant to my present investigation:\n\n&gt; Two years before De la Beche was taken [to the Anning Family] by his mother, Mary Anning, reputed to be the subject of “She sells sea shells on the sea shore,” completed the recovery of a new kind of fossil reptile.\n\nFirst of all, this sentence features an atrocious overuse of commas. Second, and unfortunate for us, the tongue twister is never mentioned again. Among the sources for the chapter, two are cited in relation to Mary Anning and they are both from before 1860. I mean, credit to the author for going to primary sources, but I doubt any of them will reference a tongue twister coined in 1908. For extra certainty, I checked all the other sources for the chapter. Only two are from after 1860 and neither seem to have anything to do with Mary Anning.\n\nUnfortunately, this ends my list of sources to follow as no reputable website would use such things, least of all a popular youtube show.\n\n*****\n\n# Cheat with Google!\n\nIn the absence of any good sources, I turned to google to see if it could track down some useful book for me.\n\nFirst, it is worth noting yet again that Mary Anning was somewhat famous while she was alive and her fame continued after her death. There are more than a few newspaper articles discussing her achievements from well after her death (from [a](https://books.google.com/books?id=yfMlfIbOlUsC&amp;pg=PA262&amp;dq=mary+anning&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZyN_bo-rTAhXMKCYKHa7qCD4Q6AEIPjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=mary%20anning&amp;f=false)[b](https://books.google.com/books?id=0HMHAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=mary+anning&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZyN_bo-rTAhXMKCYKHa7qCD4Q6AEIOTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=mary%20anning&amp;f=false)[o](https://books.google.com/books?id=qtRhAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA197&amp;dq=mary+anning&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZyN_bo-rTAhXMKCYKHa7qCD4Q6AEIVDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=mary%20anning&amp;f=false)[v](https://books.google.com/books?id=K8YPAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA386&amp;dq=mary+anning&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZyN_bo-rTAhXMKCYKHa7qCD4Q6AEIWjAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=mary%20anning&amp;f=false)[e](https://books.google.com/books?id=RqK8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA116&amp;dq=mary+anning&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiYra7wo-rTAhXLKiYKHXxLB3M4ChDoAQgnMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=mary%20anning&amp;f=false)). This means it is by no means out of the question that the author (Terry Sullivan?) of “She Sells Sea Shells” could have heard of her.\n\nSecond, it is somewhat interesting to trace the rise of “she sells sea shells.” Both the [Wilkie Bard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NnsJ7pbwpY) and the [Billie Murray](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StZPSe7mKSA) versions of the song are available on youtube. Note that both include a preamble, during which the singer says they commissioned the song for a play they are to appear in. Wilkie Bard's version then mentions the supposed justification that the fictional author of the song gave:\n\n&gt; [I wanted a song about the sea, something with a nice breezy melody, but I couldn't do it so I did the next best thing. I got a man to write me about things that are in the sea, such as fish - fish. I got Sam Isaacs. He's written me a very nice fish chorus. It goes something like this…](http://monologues.co.uk/musichall/Songs-S/Sea-Shells.htm)\n\nThere are two interesting things to note here: shells are not fish so the intro is a lie, also there is no mention of Mary Anning, even in Wilkie Bard’s version which would have been sung in England. Then again, I don’t think we can take this intro as definitive evidence, as it does not mention Terry Sullivan but instead gives credit to a “Sam Isaacs.”\n\nRegardless, newspaper clippings confirm that the phrase “she sells sea shells by the sea shore” was recognized as a hard phrase to say by at least [1912](https://books.google.com/books?id=FGEwAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA5-PA27&amp;dq=%22she+sells+seashells+by+the+seashore%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi477a_terTAhUJWSYKHQwuAT0Q6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22she%20sells%20seashells%20by%20the%20seashore%22&amp;f=false), where it appears in a newspaper article about Winston Churchill. It next appears in a book of tongue twisters in [1915](https://books.google.com/books?id=e_Y1AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=she+sells+seashells+by+the+sea+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiD0onjterTAhVKySYKHU7IC9gQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=she%20sells%20seashells%20by%20the%20sea%20shore&amp;f=false). I might consider this evidence of the lyrics migrating from song to tongue twister, except that [google ngrams](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=she+sells+sea+shells%2Bshe+sells+seashells%2C+tongue+twister&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%3B%2C%28she%20sells%20sea%20shells%20%2B%20she%20sells%20seashells%29%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Ctongue%20twister%3B%2Cc0) suggests that tongue twisters as a whole started to gain popularity in print around 1917 or so.\n\nRegardless, the first text to contain both the name Mary Anning and the phrase “she sells sea shells” on record appears to be Henry de la Beche’s book (which is not part of Google Books, mind you). The earliest book in Google Books appears to be “[The Riddle of the Dinosaur](https://books.google.com/books?id=eWDhAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=mary+anning+%22she+sells+seashells%22&amp;dq=mary+anning+%22she+sells+seashells%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjBxpb1p-rTAhUJRyYKHavIBHQ4KBDoAQhBMAY),” which I [also purchased](http://imgur.com/a/DjCko) for **$7.98**. I don’t want to make this post too long, so suffice it to say this book was no more useful than the previous one (though it was similarly sourced, just not with the source I want).\n\n*****\n\n# A Quick Note About Shell Collecting and Selling\n\nThis post must end eventually, but I promised to raise some reasonable doubts. In that vein, note that Mary Anning did not invent shell collecting and I sincerely doubt she was the first shell salesperson. I originally wanted to find evidence of a shell store from before the 1900s, but I could not find one. It is possible none existed. Regardless, a simple perusal of wikipedia will show the reader that shells (such as [cowries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowry#Human_use)) have been collected for thousands of years and [curio cabinets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_curiosities) (which often included shells) were popular in Europe for a long time before Mary Anning. This point would be stronger if I had bothered to find explicit examples of shells being sold by people other than Mary Anning, but I’m not being paid for this so I hope the reader can indulge me in this particular assumption.\n\nBasically, my point is the “she” who “sells sea shells” does not necessarily refer to Mary Anning. I imagine most sea shell salespeople lived by the sea shore, even during the 1800s, and I would not be surprised if more than a few were women.\n\n*****\n\n# In summary,\n\nat the expense of over 10 hours of googling and $25.04 of my own money, I have not turned up any reliable source showing that the tongue twister “she sells sea shells by the sea shore” refers specifically to Mary Anning. Considering the time difference and the complete lack of any evidence other than some somewhat suggestive lyrics, I am inclined to call this a coincidence rather than a reference.\n\nBecause it is really hard to prove a negative, and I never did find anything concrete about the writer (Terry Sullivan?) or their actual motivations, I would like to end with a bounty: if anyone has some useful suggestions that would significantly improve this post with relatively little effort (for someone on Long Island) I would be inclined to pursue their suggestion, including spending a moderate amount of my own money. Furthermore, if anyone can refute this post or write a better one on the same subject, I will gild them.\n\n*****\n\n\n# Breaking News\n\nSometimes, you have a whole post written and ready to go, but then you find new evidence. Evidence like a book of mouth exercises from [1888](https://books.google.com/books?id=aNUfAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=%22she+sells+sea+shells%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiS38_otOrTAhXB5CYKHaq-CEc4FBDoAQgzMAM#v=onepage&amp;q=%22she%20sells%20sea%20shells%22&amp;f=false). That's 20 years before the song! \"Hang on,\" you may think, \"this version does not mention the sea shore. Thus it is unrelated and I may discount it.\" However, there is another book from [1898](https://books.google.com/books?id=rz89AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=she+sells+seashells+by+the+sea+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZ6_nBt-rTAhWF0iYKHXf4Akc4FBDoAQg4MAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=she%20sells%20seashells%20by%20the%20sea%20shore&amp;f=false) that does reference a sea shore. In fact, this book makes your post even stronger because it references a \"Susan\" instead of a \"Mary Anning.\" \"Fine,\" you think, \"I'll just tack it on at the end. No one will mind that. They will appreciate your scholastic integrity for mentioning it and they won't be mad that you didn't rewrite the entire thing to reflect this new information. That would be way too much work.\"",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/6ak958/making_persia_great_again_bill_wurtz_safavid_iran/",
        "text": "So, the maker of the “History of Japan” video, Bill Wertz, has created a new video, [“history of the entire world i guess”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuCn8ux2gbs). It’s as funny as the last, and impressively non-Eurocentric for a video of its type. It feels pretty much like he raided Wikipedia, and as /u/sunagainstgold [put it](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6agz4s/bill_wurtz_just_uploaded_his_history_of_the/dheoqau/), “it’s a glorified timeline of the \"Key Words\" box at the end of each chapter in a grade-8 history book”. But it’s a fun watch all the same.\n\nAnyway, the video has already been discussed in another thread, but I wanted to use this opportunity to discuss something that I see quite a lot: the idea that the Safavids represented a revival of the “Persian Empire”, or at least of Iranian statehood. Wurtz only mentions the Safavids briefly, at 12:59, where he says “move over Timurids, go and invade India or something. Persia just made Persia Persian again” before talking about their Shi’ification. He’s quite right about the Safavids turning Iran Shi’ite, however simplistically, but he is dead wrong about The Safavids making Persia “Persian” again. That is an old nationalist idea, which saw the Safavids as a proto-national Iranian state for several reasons: the reunification of the plateau under a single rule, the fact that the Safavid borders roughly approximate the modern Iranian borders, the creation of a unified identity via Shi'ism, and the continuity in Iranian statehood from Safavid times to the present.\n\nThe only problem is that this is pretty much all nonsense. Firstly, the concepts of \"Persia\" and \"Persian\" have no relevance to the situation. \"Persia\" is just a European exonym; \"Iran\" was pretty consistently the region's endonym amongst Iranians and Middle Easterners since its invention during the reign of Ardashir, with the concept of being \"Arya\" or non-Arya going back to Achaemenid times, at least. Persia is just a corrupted version of Parsa, the native name for the region/city from which the Achaemenids sprang, which is now known as Fars (from the same root, only with the Persian \"P\" replaced by an Arabic \"F\"). \"Persian\" was understood only as a language within the Middle East, which did not hold any national concepts at this time.\n\nSecondly, the concept of Iran was not re-introduced by the Safavids, nor did they explicitly identify with Iranian concepts of kingship or identity more than the preceding dynasties. After the Islamic conquest, Iran's meaning changed to merely being a region within the Islamic world, and a rather nebulous one at that. There were certainly forms of Iranian identity being expressed in this period, but they weren't really forms of \"national\" identity. Religious identity still predominated, and while a certain cultural identity of being *'ajam* as opposed to being Arab or (later) Tajik as opposed to Turk existed, these were more elite cultural markers than descriptors of a national identity. Even Ferdowsi's poetry can't be called nationalist- he was a committed Muslim (I think it's generally thought he was Shi'a these days) and the idea that he purged Arabic loanwords is largely a myth (I forget who demonstrated this, shall have to look it up later). Ferdowsi's work can be seen more as a desire to reclaim the region's history than as an example of Iranian nationhood.\n\nSo while there were ways in which the region's indigenous population asserted differing forms of cultural identity against Arabic domination, calling it \"nationalism\" is anachronistic. The idea of \"Iran\" as a political region to rule was not really relied upon either; although the Seljuks and Buyids sporadically claimed the title of Shahanshah, and in the case of the latter would occasionally appeal to a Sassanid legacy, these were never the foundations of their rule. Sassanid conceptions of kingship *did* have a strong legacy in the eastern Islamic world, but these found their way through via ideas about the role of the king, or titles such as \"Padishah\", or the role of justice and religion, rather than as a way to claim authority over Iran.\n\nThis changed with the Mongols. Loosening ties to the Yuan court left the Toluids floundering to find an alternative mode of legitimacy, which led to the resurrection of Iran as a political concept. The movement from a Chinggisid form of legitimacy to a more Perso-Islamic form of kingship led to a need to redefine the space over which they ruled- they thus became Padishahs of Iran. They were not trying to \"revive\" a Sassanid ideal of Iran, but defining the area over which they ruled while also altering themselves to a more Perso-Islamic model of kingship, which contained a lot of Sassanid heritage.\n\nThese models of kingship were continued in the post-Mongol world; the Turkmen states in the west continued to rely upon Ilkhanid modes of legitimacy, relying on lineage-based models of kingship but also defining themselves as rulers of Iran. Timur relied on a broad base of legitimacy; appeals to a Chinggisid lineage (via his wives and puppet rulers) and legacy, religious charisma, astrological titles such as the famous *sahib-qiran* (or \"Lord of the Auspicious Conjunction\"), and so on. Shahrukh and his successors radically altered this, changing the foundation of Timurid rule to a more traditional, orthodox Perso-Islamic model of kingship, in response to internal woes within the Timurid realm and increasingly radical millenarian movements that threatened Timurid rule. Throughout these times, the idea of Iran as a political concept did not disappear, but- as in Ilkhanid times- was simply a geographical description and only one way of concieving the state, and not often the most important one.\n\nThe same applies for the Safavids. They did indeed reunite the region under a single ruler, and they did create a certain ideological uniformity that had long been lacking. In particular, we see a unity between Turkmen and Timurid artistic and chancellery traditions. But their rule was based on millenarian and Alid appeals, not Iranian modes of thought. In Safavid ideology, Isma'il was the herald of the apocalypse, concieved of as waging a war of vengeance against the Sunnis of the region and establishing a just Shi'ite utopia in preparation for the end times that would coincide with the Islamic millenium. The more extreme variants of Safavid ideology cast him as the Mahdi, and among more extreme Qizilbash elements he was God himself. While Safavid rule fitted itself to an extent with the kind of Perso-Islamic frameworks mentioned earlier, there's nothing that constitutes a revival of identity or the Sassanid state. \n\nIsma'il *was* particularly fond of the Shahnameh, naming several of his children after characters in the Book of Kings; his chancellery frequently alluded to characters and events from the text during the post-Chaldiran period as well. But this wasn't so much because he was trying to assert an Iranian character to the region as it was communicating in a Persianate milieu which existed from the Balkans to the Bengal. Naming his children after characters in the Shahnameh and alluding to characters and  events in letters was meant to recall specific virtues and heroic figures in the cultural milieu.\n\nTahmasp- once he was of age and in control of the state- relied even less upon the Shahnameh and Iranian models of kingship. He distanced himself from the explicit millenarianism of Isma’il, with the Safavid state being conceived of as the just Shi’ite kingdom, with the Safavid right to rule stemming from their Shi’ite faith, role as a Sufi *murshid*, and their sayyid lineage (which was a historical re-wrote itself, as the Safavids were likely of Kurdish descent; early versions of the official lineage, the *Safvat al-Safa*, were rewritten accordingly). Under ‘Abbas, we see a more imperial and absolutist form of sovereignty, which leant to a far greater degree on Perso-Islamic ideas of rule. The Sufi heritage was sharply downplayed, while ‘Abbas appealed to both popular religiosity and Shi’ite orthodoxy. The end result is a state centred on the Shah and his authority, as an emperor and as a Shi’ite representative of the Imams. It used Iranian and Sassanid ideas, and was conceived of as the *mamalik-i Iran* (lands of Iran), a geographic descriptor and not a national one. The Safavids certainly did not make Iran “Persian” or “Iranian” again; they just continued traditions that had long been held by the state.\n\nSafavid Iran was not, then, a revival of the Sassanids and Achaemenids. It was an ideological chameleon, constantly shifting its bases of power to appeal to different groups at different times. The idea that it was a restoration of the ancient Persian/Iranian empires is deeply flawed, a product of nationalist historiography that has long been abandoned in academia. Safavid history should be seen on its own terms, and should not be a slave to present-day concerns. But one can’t really blame Wurtz and others for characterising it in these terms, however: Safavid history is hardly a popular subject for Western pop-history, and as with all facets of pre-modern Iranian history, the public discourse is often invested with a strong degree of nationalist ideology. It was not until the 19th century, and thinkers such as Akhundzadeh and Kermani, that an explicitly Iranian identity comes into being.\n\n(This post was rather rushed, so I apologise if anything is unclear, as I'm pretty sure it is. I'll look over and edit it at some point in the next few days.)\n\n**Some books you may find interesting on Safavid kingship:**\n\nAmir Arjomand, Said. The Shadow of God and the Hidden Imam. Chicago, London: University of Chicago Press, 1987. (Arjomand’s book is more about Shi’ism and political action, and it getting a bit old, but he deals with the legacy of Sassanid kingship quite a lot).\n\nBabayan, Kathryn. Mystics, Monarchs and Messiahs. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2003. (Babayan’s work is brilliant, and a great analysis of how Iranian kingship and cultural identity developed across the Islamic era but especially during the early modern period).\n\nMitchell, Colin P. The Practice of Politics in Safavid Iran London: I.B. Tauris, 2012. (Mitchell’s book is about Safavid chancellery practices, and the kinds of rhetoric they used.)\n\nMoin, A Azfar. The Millenial Sovereign. New York: Columbia University Press, 2012. (Moin is more concerned with the Mughals than the Safavids, but he does discuss them extensively, and dwells a lot on how the Timurids, Safavids and Mughals all influenced one anothers’ conceptions of authority).\n\nThe ever-fantastic [Encyclopedia Iranica](http://www.iranicaonline.org) has a wealth of information on all these topics, too.",

        "title": "Bill Wurtz is at it again with another hilarious video! It's sure to be accurate, right?",
        "author": "Inkshooter",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/6ajdqc/bill_wurtz_is_at_it_again_with_another_hilarious/",
        "text": "It's happened again. Bill Wurtz finally dropped the [sizzlin' sequel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuCn8ux2gbs) to his smash-hit video \"history of japan\", and Reddit has predictably lost its goddamned mind. I don't dislike Bill Wurtz at all, I even would consider myself a fan of his. I really like his sense of humor and his production value is off the charts, but pop history is in the awkward position of having less rigorous standards than academic history while simultaneously being far more widely-consumed, so untold millions of people are going to see this video and take it as true even though humor and entertainment is his primary goal. And in that sense, his video was both humorous and entertaining. Good job, Bill! So let's see how he did with the actual history.\n\nOh, he's doing the history of literally everything? Alright, then. This will probably take a while. I have next to no scientific training so I'm not even going to touch the pre-human stuff. It's difficult to tell what is deliberately a comedic exaggeration and what is an actual mistake, so I'll err on the side of caution with things I'm not sure about (and I swear to God this has nothing to do with the fact that I'm not in grad school yet).\n\n:00-4:30 - Astrophysics, evolutionary biology,and bioanthropology. Sorry, this ain't my field. \n\n4:30-5:30 - So, this periodization is inherently going to be pretty wonky, since there are multiple developments happening simultaneously around the world. As far as I can tell, these dates are mostly accurate. \n\n5:24 - The chariot was invented near the Caucasus, not the northern expanses of Bumfuck-Nowhere, Eurasian Steppe.\n\n6:42 - Philosophy has existed for quite a bit longer than the Socratic tradition, especially outside Europe. There was a Greek philosophical tradition that predated Socrates, too.\n\n7:55 - I don't know if Bill is implying that this is when silk was invented (if that's the case, he's wrong, silk fabric has existed since prehistory) but if he's just talking about the silk trade starting here, he's also wrong, since the so-called \"silk road\" existed before the start of the Common Era.\n\n9:05 - The Eastern Roman Empire never stopped calling itself the Roman Empire. \"Byzantine Empire\" was a neologism coined in the 16th century. This is a VERY common mistake, though, so I can't get too mad at him.\n\n10:23 - Vinland happened a long time after this, yo.\n\n10:26 - I'm not going to get into whether or not there was a Rurik, but the answer to Bill's question is... yes and no. The Varangians became the ruling class of the Slavic peoples in what eventually became the Kievan Rus, and intermarried with them over time to the point where the two groups became more or less indistinguishable.\n\n10:33 - No, it's not Germany.\n\n10: 57 - The First and Sixth Crusades WERE successful, and the Third Crusade ended in victory for the Crusaders, though Jerusalem remained in Muslim hands.\n\n12: 30 - I seriously hope Bill isn't repeating the frelling \"Columbus's knowledge of the shape of the Earth was unique\" myth. Also, after this point the video becomes Eurocentric as hell.\n\n12:45 - Heh heh. Nice one.\n\n13:13 - Martin Luther never wanted to \"fuck the church\", he wanted to reform it. Luther's intention was always to fix what he saw as broken in the Catholic church.\n\n13:31 - \"controlling\" the trade might be an overstatement, again there's a Eurocentric problem with this portion of the video. India and China were still enormously wealthy and far outstripped Portugal or any other European state in trade and wealth.\n\n14:31 - Best line in the video.\n\n14:37 - They did. Numerous times. The Haitian Revolution was just the first successful attempt.\n\n15:46 - This is probably for comedic timing, but the Mexican-American War happened before the Civil War.\n\n16:32 - The Bolsheviks didn't overthrow the Russian Empire. The Bolsheviks overthrew the Provisional Government, which overthrew the Russian Empire. Lenin wasn't even in Russia at the time Nicholas II was deposed. \n\n18:30 - Has it, now? Last I checked there were some VERY strong disagreements in this country over what racism even IS, let alone whether or not it's still around (spoiler alert: it is).\n\nThe rest of the video is basically modern times, and then it ends. Sad face.\n\n\n\nWell, that was the kinda-accurate, kinda-not history of the world. Since Bill has now covered the history of literally the entire universe, I doubt he'll make any more of these. But I kind of want him to!\n\n",

Edna?\n    Malory: You never heard that? How Hoover was a huge cross-dressing chicken hawk?\n    Lana: I had not.\n    Malory: Well that's exactly the kind of slanderous and unsubstantiated rumor that I will not tolerate at ISIS. Think about that while you're on suspension.\n\n\nedit: Today's Archer (S8E6) again brings up \"J Edna\" Hoover and unequivocally advances the crossdressing claim 8 minutes in.  \n*****************\na four year old reddit post\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/19psy8/til_that_j_edgar_hoover_was_a_transvestitehe/\n\n**********************\n\nThe idea that J Edgar Hoover frequently cross-dressed, was gay, etc. is around in the public imagination. I also found someone else asking \"how does this make sense\" over at another reputable subreddit (which motivated this post. I'm adapting this from my response there). I feel that question, as well as the archer comment sufficiently establish that this is a real piece of badhistory hanging around pop culture.   \n\n\n***************\n\nThis is one of those pieces of bad history which pop culture hasn't yet realized historians have repeatedly debunked (though google surprisingly mostly turns up articles debunking not supporting the claim). The whole idea stems from the 1993 biography of J Edgar Hoover Official and Confidential: The Secret Life of J. Edgar Hoover. by Anthony Summers. I like how another Hoover biographist, Anton Theoharis, puts it\n\n&gt; \"Summers's sources, if undeniably imaginative, provide no credible documentation for what amounts to no more than gossipy character assassination\"\n\n it's malarkey. Basically that 1993 biography made these claims relying only Susan Rosenstiel (a disreputable source with a history of perjury who also had an axe to grind with Hoover and the Bureau who was also being paid for her content by the biographer). It nonetheless exploded into popular culture.\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/cross-dressing-j-edgar-hoover-story-dismissed-by-historians/2011/11/08/gIQAyiiQCN_story.html?utm_term=.9da85fefedd9\n\n\n\nThe 1993 book by Summers alleges the mob was blackmailing Hoover which ironically provides a lot of evidence to completely destroy the claims (This \"fact\" was pretty strongly debunked in the 2002 book by Ronald Kessler FBI, The Bureau: The Secret History of the FBI. The book in general does a good job summarizing the entire story). Its been a while since i picked it up but the criminal group in question was was already being wiretapped (thus that information wouldn't even have to have been leaked) and there's strong evidence of Hoover continuing to press strongly against the mob despite some internal pushback after the alleged incidents had taken place. In addition there's strong evidence that if this had happened specific other people at the FBI (who were physically around Hoover all the time) would have known and that information should have come up.\n\ntl;dr it's badhistory. No current credible scholar of Hoover or the FBI supports the claim and even Summers has backed off of this a bit. \n\n",

It is time for the next part of my Saxons review, continuing on from here:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/68elxj/bad_saxon_history_or_how_byzantinebasileus_has/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=hot&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=badhistory\n\n12.05: What the hell is that knife? It looks like a left-over from the set of a Rambo movie. Definitely not a seax, so I am counting it as an inaccuracy. DRINK!\n\n12.22: The narrator states Vortigern had serfs. Serfdom (or rather, serfdom in the traditional sense) was an aspect of a long-holding form of social, economic and political organisation called feudalism, and was a result of the slow development of different forms of ownership and patron-client relationships throughout Europe, as seen from these sources:\n\nhttp://www.shsu.edu/~his_ncp/Feudal1.html\n\nThe problem with the narrator making this claim is that feudalism (or manorialism, again in the traditional sense), did not exist in the 5th century AD. Tenancy certainly existed, as Diocletian made certain occupations hereditary, and this included colonus, who were peasants tied to the land they worked. However, the social structure of Britain was different, and social and ideological values different from that which underpinned a feudal mode of existence. DRINK!\n\n12.49: \"Um, guys, what are we actually doing?\" \"Quiet! Just keep stacking hay onto this weird \nwooden frame until the film-crew leaves. Then we can start drinking.\"\n\n12.58: More fabulous and immersive voice acting!\n\n13.25: \"The Saxon vengeance is furious and swift\". As opposed Saxon vengeance being mellow and lethargic.\n\n13.36: The horsemen has modern stirrups. DRINK!\n\n13.38: HOLLYWOOD DUAL-WIELDING! DRINK!\n\n13.57: The narrator states that Vortigern was killed by his own nobles. Nennius writes that he died in a fire that consumed his fort, and ascribes the flame as falling from heaven, whilst Geoffrey of Monmouth  claims the fire was a result of Aurelius Ambrosius laying siege. I prefer the account of Nennius owing to the earlier date (wherein the fire may just have been an accident), but either way the death of Vortigern in the sources is different to that given in the episode. DRINK!\n\n14.01: Blue war paint on a Saxon warrior. DRINK!\n\n14.14: More blue war paint. DRINK!\n\n14.37: The narrator is getting the chronology wrong again. First they state that Vortigern is killed, then the Saxons and nobles of Britain organize a peace conference where the Saxons murder them. Nennius makes it clear that Vortigern attended the meeting and was taken prisoner whilst the other Britons were killed. Vortigern was then forced to give some provinces to the Saxons before he would be released. DRINK!\n\n14.58: Yet more blue war paint. DRINK!\n\n15.17: These heavy metal concerts are really getting out of hand.\n\n15.28: The narrator states that the massacre of the Celtic nobles cut the heart out of the British resistance. Yeah no. Again, Nennius writes that Vortimer, the son of Vortigern, fought and won several victories against the Saxons after the conference. DRINK!\n\n15.50: Goddammit there is that anachronistic sword. DRINK!\n\n16.30:  The dialogue consists solely of a guy going \"Uh-yayaya, uh-yayaya, uh-yayaya.\"\n\n16.14: 491 AD and we STILL HAVE SCUTUM-EQUIPPED LEGIONNAIRES! GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! DRINK!\n\n17.28: NON-INDIAN HOLLYWOOD COMBAT SPIN! DRINK!\n\n17.37: Those shoulder-pads are better suited to a Final-Fantasy outfit. And the soldier still looks like a classical Roman legionnaire. DRINK!\n\n17.59: Blue woad war-paint. DRINK!\n\n18.25: And now we have Aurelius Ambrosius and his time-travelling legionnaires. DRINK!\n\n18.59: And here we have Arthur himself, returning from a Pathfinder LARP. The Narrator says that, according to legend, he assisted  Aurelius Ambrosius. This is a cunning way of saying \"I am making shit up\". Gildas and Bede do not mention Arthur at all. Gildas discussed Ambrosius, but the whole Arthur/Ambrosius/Uther drama is present only in the *History of the Kings of Britain*, and might be completely fabricated. DRINK!\n\n19.02: The historian says we do not have any contemporary evidence for Arthur as a historical figure. Of course, it is hard to find *contemporary* evidence for any historical figure that long ago, and even in modern times the existence of certain individuals like Luke Perry after 1992 is heavily doubted. Nennius writes about Arthur and gives several details about his battles, which seems to suggest a strong oral tradition, and thus  the presence Arthur as a definite person. The fact that Arthur is explicitly referred to as a military commander rather than a king seems to indicate a certain level of authenticty.\n\n19.42: The episode states that the Battle of Mt Badon took place in 501 AD. Bede states that the Saxons first came to Britain in 449 AD, and that the battle occurred 44 years later, so the date should be 493 AD. Gildas gives the same figure as well. DRINK!\n\n19.56: I don't know enough about siege equipment to comment on its accuracy, so I shall reserve a drink until another Redditor can clarify things. Edit: According to r/dirish, it is possible the Saxons might have used such a device, but the chances are they did not. So, DRINK!\n\n20.04: \"I'm melting! Melting! Oh, what a world! What a world!\"\n\n20.51: Another sword that does not belong to the time period. DRINK!\n\nAnd that is it for now!\n\nSources\n\nAlfred the Great: War, Culture and Kingship in Anglo-Saxon England, by Richard Abels\n\nThe Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Part One: http://omacl.org/Anglo/part1.html\n\nEurope Between the Oceans: 9000 BC-AD 1000, by Barry Cunliffe\n\nEcclisiastical History of England, by Bede: https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html\n\nGermania, by Tacitus: https://archive.org/stream/tacitusagricolag00taciiala/tacitusagricolag00taciiala_djvu.txt\n\nHistory of the Britons, by Nennius: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/History_of_the_Britons\n\nHistory of the Kings of Britain, by Geoffrey of Monmouth: http://www.yorku.ca/inpar/geoffrey_thompson.pdf\n\nThe Ruin of Britain, by Gildas: http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1949/pg1949.html\n\nWarfare and Society in the Barbarian West 450-900, by Guy Halsall\n\n",

I took no part myself in any such view of the case at the time, but since the war is over, reviewing the whole question, I have come to the conclusion that the saying is quite true.\" - US Grant, from his memoirs \n\n “We are sometimes asked in the name of patriotism to forget the merits of this [The Civil War] fearful conflict and to remember with equal admiration those who struck at the nation’s life and those who struck to save it—those who fought for slavery and those who fought for liberty and justice.” Fredrick Douglass, 1871 at Arlington Cemetary. \n\nEdit 3: POTUS browses reddit!!!\n\nhttps://mobile.twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/859209801175269376?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet\n\nhttps://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/us/politics/trump-andrew-jackson-fact-check.html?smid=fb-nytpolitics&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;referer=http://m.facebook.com/",

        "text": "In \"How the War was Won,\" O'Brien compared Japanese naval production favorably with that of the British:\n\n\"Between 1942 and 1944, the Japanese finished construction of one battleship (of the enormous 64,000 ton Yamato class), 13 aircraft carriers, 5 cruisers, 55 destroyers and 99 submarines. As a point of comparison, the United Kingdom in these years completed 2 battleships (combined displacement of 70,000 tons), 6 aircraft carriers, 15 cruisers, 141 destroyers, and 111 submarines. Beyond the obvious British superiority in destroyer construction and Japanese superiority in carrier construction, these production profiles were quite similar.” \n\nBefore I discuss carrier production, I’ll note that, though the King George V class battleships initially were 35 kilotons to keep within treaty limits, they ended up displacing around 40 kilotons, so the combined displacement of two of them would be 80 kilotons, not 70. \n\nI used the following sources:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Japanese_Navy_ships_and_war_vessels_in_World_War_II#Aircraft_Carrier\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_aircraft_carriers_of_the_Royal_Navy\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_escort_carriers_of_the_Royal_Navy\n\nhttp://www.naval-history.net/WW2aBritishLosses02CV.htm\n\nThese are the carriers the Royal Navy commissioned from 1942-1944 (not counting merchant aircraft carriers, which only carried 4 planes):\n\nEscort carrier HMS Activity (29 September 1942)\n\nLight carrier HMS Unicorn (12 March 1943)\n\nEscort carrier HMS Pretoria Castle (29 July 1943)\n\nEscort carrier HMS Vindex (3 December 1943)\n\nEscort carrier HMS Nairana (12 December 1943)\n\nEscort carrier HMS Campania (9 February 1944)\n\nFleet carrier HMS Indefatigable (3 May 1944)\n\nFleet carrier HMS Implacable (28 August 1944) \n\nLight carrier HMS Colossus (16 December 1944)\n\nThis is a total of 9 carriers: 2 fleet, 2 light, and 5 escort carriers. \n\nThese are the carriers the Imperial Japanese Navy commissioned from 1942-1944 (not counting Akitsu Maru or Migitsu Maru, which were used by the Army and could not land aircraft):\n\n\nLight  carrier Junyō (5 May 1942)\n\nLight carrier Hiyō (31 July 1942)\n\nEscort carrier Unyō (31 August 1942)\n\nEscort carrier Chūyō (25 November 1942)\n\nEscort carrier Shin'yō (15 November 1943)\n\nEscort carrier Kaiyō (23 November 1943)\n\nFleet carrier Taihō (7 March 1944)\n\nFleet carrier Unryū (6 August 1944)\n\nFleet carrier Amagi (10 August 1944)\n\nFleet carrier Katsuragi (15 October 1944)\n\nFleet carrier Shinano (19 November 1944)\n\nThis doesn’t include ships that were first commissioned before 1942 as another ship type but were converted to carriers during the war, namely the light carriers Chitose, Chiyoda, and Ryūhō, since converting existing ships takes much less productive effort than building a new carrier from scratch. Thus, the IJN commissioned 5 fleet, 2 light, and 4 escort carriers.  \n\nSo, the Royal Navy commissioned 9 carriers from 1942-1944, and the Imperial Japanese Navy commissioned 11 in that period. In addition, O’Brien conveniently excludes the year 1945, when the Royal Navy commissioned the Colossus-class light carriers HMS Vengeance, HMS Venerable, HMS Pioneer, HMS Glory, HMS Warrior, and HMS Ocean before the end of the war, while the Imperial Japanese Navy commissioned just the escort carriers Yamashio Maru and Shimane Maru (and the Army commissioned Kumano Maru, which again couldn’t aircraft). If we include 1945, the Royal Navy commissioned 15 total aircraft carriers after Pearl Harbor (2 fleet, 8 light, and 5 escort), while the Imperial Japanese Navy commissioned 13 aircraft carriers (5 fleet, 2 light, and 6 escort). This seems like an approximately equal production profile, with perhaps a Japanese “superiority” only looking at fleet carriers. However, this superiority is less pronounced given that the Colossus-class light carriers carried as many aircraft as 4 of the 5 Japanese fleet carriers built after Pearl Harbor (only Taihō carried much more aircraft). \n\nThus, if we examine more carefully British and Japanese carrier production after Pearl Harbor, it’s clear that the production profiles are at best about equal, if not tilted towards the Royal Navy. If we combine this with the British superiority in Battleships (even more than O’Brien claims), Cruisers (triple the production), and Destroyers (almost triple production, and not counting smaller anti-sub vessels such as frigates and corvettes), it is clear that British naval production was significantly higher than Japanese, perhaps double the Japanese amount. In fact, according to Andrew Boyd’s  “The Royal Navy in Eastern Waters,” Royal Navy production at least matched the combined naval production of all three Axis powers (Germany, Italy, and Japan), with an inferiority in battleships (5 King George V class vs 2 Bismarck class, 3 Littorio class, and 2 Yamato class) and submarines compensated for with a larger combined cruiser, destroyer and anti-submarine vessel production. In addition, Royal Navy production matched US Navy production until the end of 1942, when massive amounts of fleet, light, and specially escort carriers were commissioned by the United States Navy:\n\n17 Essex-class fleet carriers before the end of the war\n\n\n9 Independence class light carriers\n\n4 Charger-class escort carriers (3 lend-leased to the Royal Navy)\n\n45 Bogue-class escort carriers (most lend-leased to the Royal Navy)\n\n4 Sangamon-class escort carriers\n\n50 Casablanca-class escort carriers\n\n10 Commencement Bay-class escort carriers before the end of the war\n\n\n113 total escort carriers\n\n\nThis gives a total of 139 aircraft carriers commissioned by the United States Navy between Pearl Harbor and the end of the war. \n\nThis massive American production of carriers in the 2nd half of the war has tended to obscure the carriers produced by the British, especially since the former saw much more combat in the Pacific, but British naval production remained strong to the very end of the war. \n\n\n",

        "text": "Greetings Badhistoriers! Today I am reviewing another documentary from the Barbarians series. This one is Season 2, Episode 2 - The Saxons:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuM4Auxml98\n\nThe Germanic nature of this installment requires that I have my trusty bottle of Mead handy. So let us begin!\n\n0.08: And once again, a warrior from the Late Roman period has a sword with a crossguard better suited to the high or late Middle Ages. DRINK!\n\n0.032: Even though the battle scene is clearly meant to be set in the Late Roman Era, the door in the background has a modern lever handle. DRINK!\n\n0.36: The Roman soldiers here are completely inaccurate. Late Roman troops should look like this:\n\nhttps://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-4aa2e4d15ff5f8e3e068c8c511d87f7b-c\n\nInstead what is portrayed is the classic, square-scutum, segmentata legionnaire from the early and middle Empire:\n\nhttps://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/73/d0/4a/73d04a5937b203e805ddcad858486c28.jpg\n\nDRINK!\n\n1.15: One of the Saxon warriors is wearing blue woad warpaint, which was Pictish, not Germanic. DRINK!\n\n1.25: Sword with crossguard from the late medieval period. DRINK!\n\n1.32: I trust this historian because he has an awesome mustache.\n\n1.35: The historian is named Michael Jones and he works for Bates College. I wonder if he has a Masters.........\n\n1.47: More classic, scutum-equppied legionnaires. DRINK!\n\n3.16: The sword held by the warrior in the coif looks like a pure fanatasy weapon. DRINK!\n\n3.22: That is the most unenthusiastic cheering I have ever seen. \n\n4.10: Now the narrator is stating that the Great Migrations created a burning desire in the hearts of Hengist and Horsa, the future Saxon warlords. Total bullsh#t. *The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle* says this about them in 449 AD:\n\n\"This year Marcian and Valentinian assumed the empire, and reigned seven winters.  In their days Hengest and Horsa, invited by Wurtgern, king of the Britons to his assistance, landed in Britain in a place that is called Ipwinesfleet; first of all to support the Britons, but they afterwards fought against\nthem.  The king directed them to fight against the Picts; and they did so; and obtained the victory wheresoever they came. They then sent to the Angles, and desired them to send more\nassistance.\"\n\nOne can certainly speculate as to their ambitions, but to actually explain as if it were true what they were feeling is just very bad historical practice as their is absolutely zero evidence to support such an assertion. DRINK!\n\n4.17: The narrator says that, as legend has it, Hengist and Horsa would lead their people to a new home. Now, there is much debate as to the historicity of the two individuals, but the fact that they are mentioned in primary sources like *The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle* indicate a surviving oral tradition and so they most like existed, and were not legendary at all. DRINK!\n\n4.29: Yet more classic, scutum-equppied legionnaires in 436 AD. DRINK!\n\n5.06: A historian should never have a New Jersey accent.\n\n5.16: The Roman villa again has a lever handle on the door, but with modern glass windows as well. DRINK!\n\n5.57: A Pict is saying \"Run them down!\" in such an indifferent tone that I imagine him just sighing whilst thinking \"Well, I guess I have to plunder Britain *again*.\"\n\n7.22: More blue war-paint on a Germanic warrior. DRINK!\n\n8.09: There is that sword with the cross-guard again. Are they just pulling props out at random? DRINK!\n\n8.29: WHY THE HELL DOES THAT HISTORIAN HAVE A SKULL IN HIS OFFICE?\n\n8.43: As the narrator says that the Saxons advanced behind shields like the Romans, the Saxons are running madly forward like extras from Braveheart.\n\n8.55: \"The Saxons push the Picts back to the highlands for good\". If you have ever been to Newcastle you unfortunately know this is not true.\n\n9.25: These voices-overs are worse than an anime dub.\n\n9.34: \"When the Saxons were hired as mercenaries they were given food, they were given supplies, money, and maybe some land, but they wanted more\". This is why immigration and the welfare state will lead to the fall of Western Civilization.\n\n9.45: I must point out that the idea of \"ravenous Saxons\" is only one interpretation. This is what the translation of Gildas states in regards to supplies:\n\n\"obtain an allowance of provisions, which, for some time being plentifully bestowed, stopped their doggish mouths. Yet they complain that their monthly supplies are not furnished in sufficient abundance, and they industriously aggravate each occasion of quarrel, saying that unless more liberality is shown them, they will break the treaty and plunder the whole island. In a short time, they follow up their threats with deeds. \"\n\nIt could be said that the rebellion of the Saxons came about when they no longer recieved supplies for their service. Based on Germanic tradition, a wealthy individual would be expected to provide gifts to their followers in exchange for their service. As they were no longer being given rations and other items, the British rulers had violated the basic rules of the gift-economy, and so were no longer seen as worth fighting for. If the Saxons had been land-owners they would not have relied on the British for supplies, and so were most likely mobile warrior bands attached to Vortigern, with their families given basic residences. As such they had to act on their own and conquer to gain the necessary food to support their community. Of course, this is if we dismiss a lot of what is mentioned in the *History of the Britons*. \n\n9.49: GODDAMMIT NARRATOR, STOP TELLING US WHAT HENGIST AND HORSA WERE THINKING! DRINK!\n\n10.03: I'd like to be invited inside her borders.\n\n10.25: Hands of Vorti, she's mine! That's it, the British Celts were conquered because they were cock-blockers.\n\n11.04: The narrator claims the alliance between Vortigern and the Saxons is headed for disaster. I am counting this as Badhistory as it carries the implication that the rebellion of the Saxons was inevitable, when any number of events could have resulted in things ending differently. A historian needs to say \"This happened, and this is why we think it occurred\" as opposed to \"It was going to finish in this way, and here is why\". DRINK!\n\n11.06: \"Soon the Saxons will write their names across the green British country-side in blood!\" That must be one very big pen.\n\n11.39: The narrator says Vortigern took land from the British nobility and gave it to the Saxons. There is nothing to suggest he did this. Not in *The Ruin of Britain* or *The Anglo-Saxon Chroncle*. *The History of the Britons* states that that the ruler of Kent, Guoyrancgonus, lost it when it was granted to the Saxons, but this could mean any number of things. The Saxons could have been granted the land as foederati and thus obtained the right to draw taxes, but left the current land-holders in place. Alternatively, Kent could have been depopulated because of past raiding by pirates, and there may have been lots of land available for the Saxons to settle as military colonists, with Guoyrancgonus being removed as governor. There is absolutely no evidence to state such a thing as if it were fact. DRINK!\n\n11.47: The voice-over of Vortigern is just a dude repeating gibberish into a microphone.\n\nThat is all for now, stay tuned for the next part!\n\nSources\n\nAlfred the Great: War, Culture and Kingship in Anglo-Saxon England, by Richard Abels \n\nThe Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Part One: http://omacl.org/Anglo/part1.html\n\nEurope Between the Oceans: 9000 BC-AD 1000, by Barry Cunliffe\n\nGermania, by Tacitus: https://archive.org/stream/tacitusagricolag00taciiala/tacitusagricolag00taciiala_djvu.txt\n\nHistory of the Britons, by Nennius: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/History_of_the_Britons\n\nThe Ruin of Britain, by Gildas: http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1949/pg1949.html\n\nWarfare and Society in the Barbarian West 450-900, by Guy Halsall\n",

The war of 1864 was certainly considered a war by the people engaged; the danish ministry of war sent [this](http://danmarkshistorien.dk/leksikon-og-kilder/vis/materiale/krigsministeriets-instruks-til-general-de-meza-13-januar-1864/?no_cache=1&amp;cHash=eaca59c021b2f1243ad3f4d65ecd8e1b) message to General de Meza, the commande of the danish forces(source in danish, sorry). \n\nIn this the ministry refers to \"war\" with Austria and Prussia. the same does the peace treaty of the same year, the [Treaty](https://web.archive.org/web/20110719132918/http://www.ambwien.um.dk/NR/rdonlyres/AB922586-4291-44C2-BFFA-0FF1424170A2/0/Fredstraktat1864.pdf) [Of Vienna](http://danmarkshistorien.dk/leksikon-og-kilder/vis/materiale/wienertraktaten-1864/?no_cache=1&amp;cHash=85795e9f999a34ecdee117f27bb80301). (These are in french and danish respectively, hope that's okay). \n\nSo it should be obvious that the war of 1864 was in fact a war, just as much as the Austro-Prussian war, and with just as many consequences for the formation of the danish state as the war of 1866 had for the German. The war lead indirectly to a period of dictatorship in Denmark. Other sources apart from the above-mentioned are *Grimberg, Carl: History of the World vol. 15 Bismarcks epoch* (a very old swedish historian, but still quite interesting. If this breaks any rules of the sub I'll be happy to see it removed!",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/677g4o/much_ado_about_tarot_dummett_et_al_vs_jodorowsky/",
        "text": "\"No one knows who created Tarot, or where, or when,\" say Alexander Jodorowsky and Philippe Camoin (who's a descendent of one of the major printers of the Tarot de Marseilles during the 18th century) in their introductory booklet (itself an excerpt from The Art of the Tarot) for their admittedly very well-produced Tarot de Marseille deck, published in 1998. A very shocking assumption, given that Michael Dummett in his work \"The Game of Tarot\" pretty much established beyond a doubt that Tarot was invented in the 1420s and 30s in Lombardy (admittedly I can't remember the WHO) for the express purpose of playing card games (the Camoin-Jodorowsky deck plays quite well). Even more damningly for this piece of Bad History, they rattle of a list of early references to Tarot, mentioning that European playing cards were first referenced in 1377 (meaning Tarot couldn't predate this era), and that it was mentioned in the 1450s by St Anthony of Florence, seemingly meaning that Tarot was already well known at this point; they have the pieces but seemingly can't put them together. They then proceed to rattle off the most nonsensical Bad History claims about Tarot history (albeit having the dignity to at least admit they're speculative— I'm not going to discuss any of the claims here).\n\nNext they claim that \"the Tarot de Marseille is a message sent through time, free of all restriction, in order to become the key to the Unique Arcanum... awareness\", and that \"the Tarot de Marseille [has] no known geographic, historical or ideological roots\". Yes, the Tarot de Marseille, which has a *French* name, and depicts obvious Medieval European *Christian* allegories, such as the Emperor, the Pope and the Devil. Furthermore, it is established that [the oldest Tarot de Marseille pattern was Jean Noblet's deck, which originated in Paris and was published sometime around 1650](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarot_of_Marseilles#Origins), meaning there isn't much evidence that the TDM was not invented in France in the first half of the 17th century. Did I also mention that there is literally *no* reference to esoteric Tarot before Gébelin in 1781, and that literally almost *every* reference to Tarot was that it was an entertaining card game (played today all throughout Europe too, especially in France where they're based in)? Even Gébelin's account, which they even mentioned discusses the rules to a particular Tarot game played in 18th century France (quite fun, I must add). While one can say \"oh, they say it's a game, but they also say it's REAL use is for divination/occultism/etc\", they don't even mention tarot games once; even Donald Tyson, an influential occultist concedes that Tarot originated as a card game. It's as if they're completely unaware of the existence of Tarot as a game (if they are indeed aware of its existence, and they discuss it even briefly in their longer book which this booklet admittedly does not give me an impression that they do, I am very, *very* happy to redact this part of my statement).\n\nFinally, we come to the entire purpose of this deck, the restoration of the \"original\" Tarot de Marseilles (which, as previously mentioned would presumably be the Jean Noblet Tarot deck). This is a very prescriptivist view, given that even they admit there were numerous TDM patterns in the late 17th century when it first appeared, and that the number of idiosyncrasies and variants only increased in the 18th. At best, you can only achieve a \"Platonic Form\" of the TDM. In all honesty, knowing many different card game patterns throughout the ages, I personally believe (and you are free to disagree) that playing card patterns are like folk songs, with no ineffible standard carved in stone, with numerous variations throughout geographic and chronological distances.\n\nNow, it may admittedly be that Jodorowsky and Camoin were simply unaware of the scholarship surrounding the history of Tarot, it bears mentioning that they claimed to have researched the Tarot de Marseille for *forty years*; given that the deck was published in 1998, this would mean that Dummett would have published The Game of Tarot right in the middle of their research; they spend years looking up different patterns of the Tarot de Marseilles and yet the publication of a monumental text relating to the history of Tarot somehow eluded them, and never somehow coming into contact with Dummett and his associates as they spent presumably years researching the history of Tarot. They spent years tracing every pattern of the Tarot de Marseille they could find, never once coming to the conclusion that given that its history cannot be traced back further than France in the 1600s, that this somehow means that it was *probably* invented in that place and time. They spent years and years pouring through Tarot's history, yet they somehow failed to come up with any reference to Tarot as a game. What exactly were they *doing* for forty years?",
