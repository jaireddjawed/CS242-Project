WALL-E has been such an enjoyable watch for me ever since I saw it as a kid in theaters, and I would hate to find myself becoming bored with it because I've squeezed every last bit of positive emotion from it after watching it so many times.\n\nI know the movie will still end up being *technically* enjoyable, but I want to be able to watch the movie with the same fondness on each viewing.

She ends up taking this one guy who seems super strange over a period of time. I mean he is acting pretty normal, but she is still freaked out nonetheless.\n\nEventually, she runs over this guy and kills him, the passenger volunteers to help her cover up everything....\n\nAs the movie goes on you see that the passenger is a totally nice dude that never meant any harm to her whatsoever. He actually works as a paramedic. Later on.....you discover that she knew the guy she ran over and her killing him was totally planned and the gun she used to kill the cop that was investigating the blood on the road that was from the victim, belonged to the passenger she had....and she manipulated the whole situation and was planning to frame him for murdering a cop since the gun was under his name. \n\nAfter disposing of the body that she ran over, which he had to anyway since he basically had a gun to his head and was manipulated into being an accomplice, he tries to escape the situation, there is a chase and a brief scuffle, leading to him taking his gun back, holding her at gun point while she holds a log up which he used previously in self defense, he ends up being shot dead by an undercover cop....and she completely gets away with everything scot free. This undercover cop has no idea he just killed an innocent man.\n\nFUCK....OFF!!!! ü§£ü§£",

It seems most people are excited for this.\n\nFor me, it brings up some questions:\n\nAre they gonna apply the same script, acting techniques, fx, etc. that made the original the cult classic that it has become? \n\nAre they gonna alter the format in ways consistent with most other remakes (updating dialogue, acting talents, story, setting, etc..), or are they going to go for a word-for-word redo?\n\nHave there been other remakes like this?  Word-for-word do-overs that made you think you were watching the original again? The live-action version of ‚ÄúThe Lion King‚Äù comes to mind.., but are there others?\n\nIt seems most people are excited to see Bob act as if he were a bad actor- keeping true to the original, and people are probably excited to see who might be cast in the other roles.\n\nIt‚Äôs just, odd, because it seems like we‚Äôve seen this before (with those casted in ‚ÄúThe Disaster Artist‚Äù) and the scenes shown in that movie were almost more than enough to get the feeling of an adequate remake.\n\nI‚Äôm curious to see how they tackle this one. \n\nWhat do you guys think?

        "text": "Y'know, I can't help but wonder why martial arts movies don't seem to have the same cultural impact they once had in North America and Europe. Despite the occasional blockbuster like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, or Ip Man, most martial arts films today are relegated to niche audiences or straight-to-video releases, whereas in their countries of origin (China, Japan, Korea, etc.), they still dominate the box office and the cultural conversation. So, why is that? What happened to the popularity of martial arts movies in the west?\n\nI'm not sure if it's due to oversaturation, lack of novelty, cultural differences, shifts in taste, or a combination of factors, but I'm curious to hear other people's opinions. Did the glut of low-budget, poorly dubbed \"chop-socky\" flicks from the 70s and 80s tarnish the genre's reputation in the west? Did the rise of other genres like superhero movies, sci-fi, or horror push martial arts movies to the margins? Or did western audiences simply get tired of seeing the same tropes and archetypes played out over and over again?\n\nMoreover, I wonder if there's any hope for a revival or reinvention of the martial arts genre in the west. Are there any filmmakers, actors, or trends that could bring back the excitement and appeal of classics like Enter the Dragon or The Karate Kid? Or is martial arts destined to remain a niche interest, appreciated mainly by die-hard fans and connoisseurs?\n\nI'm eager to hear other people's perspectives on this issue, especially those who may have different cultural backgrounds or experiences with martial arts movies. What do you think? Why have martial arts movies lost their popularity in the west, and what, if anything, can be done about it?",

        "text": "I just finished watching this film yesterday and it was one of the most profound movie-going experiences of my life. \n\nThe music: the absolute eerieness and terror the production brings legitimately made me clench my fists at many points throughout. Droning, subtle synths combined with epic swells of color at certain points, coupled with aching stabs of shrillness. I have never seen a movie so well integrate their music and sound design better, other than perhaps the Safdie Brothers' Good Time. \n\nThe acting: I thought it was bad at first, but as the movie went on I realize how positively genius every performance is. Many of the actors, especially Glasha, have this almost trance-like quality to them, as if they were trying to forget reality itself and transcend into some other plane of existence. The lead, Aleksei Kravchenko, creates some incredibly unique facial expression that are positively bone-chilling in their uncannyness. Each performance sells the abject misery the Nazis brought with their invasion.\n\nThe setting: Dry, open tundra. Gray skies. Need I say more? Very well highlighted the bleakness of the characters' situations.\n\nI could go on and on. The shots are incredible, with those tense and well crafted long-takes that really help the viewer sink into the setting. It didn't even feel so much a war movie as a psychological horror movie about sinking slowly into the worst form of PTSD possible. \n\nAs you can probably tell, the movie is extremely dark, but for any cinemaphile out there I would argue it is a must watch. I have never had a film move me in such subtle ways and after I finished it I almost couldn't do anything else besides ponder it. Truly an under talked about gem of a movie.",
