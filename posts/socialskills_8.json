Now, those are personal chats so I’m not gonna look and read them, but this does give me some insight. With this same friend I usually only exchange memes or have the most emotionally vulnerable texts like ever, no actual consistency or anything in between.\n\nThe question is, what is there to talk about that much? I’ve read some people are just bad at texting, and since it’s not the primary media of communication I shouldn’t sweat it, but I wasn’t that good at talking either, and now I wanna learn texting too, and every time I wanna talk to a friend I just have no idea what to say. It’s not easier when someone texts me either, I try to come up with some responses but the conversation dies down quickly after that. Could it be the language barrier? I’m a refugee studying in a foreign country and even though I have amazing friends accommodating me speaking in english, there could be some sort of barrier there, but I’ve never actually had any luck in texting with my native language friends either. \n\nThank you for the help:) I could really appreciate some examples",

I tried searching for apps that help you figure what to say next when presented a certain statement, but i can't find anything appropriate for me. I recently found lingostar app, but still unsure how it can help me what to say next. I can't structure a conversation, i can't give enought details, i didn't read pratically any books. Most people can talk about topics, give details, explain them well, but, for me, after 1 or a few sentences, i will block and run out of things to say. This makes me boring as hell, i'm trying to improve my conversation skills and want to find a gf, but i don't know if my possible autism will probably get in the way and if i'm also too old for that, i'm close to 30 in age and make any self improvment useless, even if i practice all day. I heard about the spoke method, chain of association, like for a specific topic, you link many sub topics, conversation threading, there's the HPM tip from Patrick King, and stuff like that and practiced a bit but didn't see much improvment yet. How do i practice thoses tips and if some of you know any apps or tips to figure what to say, i will appreciate your help.",

One friend in particular leans on a bit too often: it's all about his life, work, emotions. I'm kind of sick of listening to him and being his unpaid counselor. It's a one-way street; but when he does ask how I'm feeling, I don't really describe anything. But in general, I don't really talk about myself even though I desperately crave an emotional outlet. Even when I went to a therapist (not for this reason), I was just unable to convey anything and literally cried the entire time.\n\nI want to feel better, trust my friends, have a safe space to vent, and cultivate my relationships more (and so would like to rectify this...slowly).\n\nPossible reasons I've thought of that compel me to be this way:\n\n1. I don't trust them to understand my problems truly and I don't think they can even sympathize (much less empathize).\n2. Even if they do understand, it's my own problem to deal with.\n3. Every time I share something, I feel like I'm revealing a part of my life for no reason.\n4. I feel pathetic and weak if I do talk about something that bothers me. My subconscious sigma, hyper independent ideals take a beating. \n5. I don't think my problems actually matter enough for me to spend time talking about them. I feel like I'm anxious in general and nothing will come out of discussing them.\n\nPlease help.",

The problem I have is that, when I actually go out, I feel low-energy, low-mood, like I don't want to be there, and like I'd rather not risk talking to people and feeling like they don't want to talk to me. I find it very hard to \"hide\" or \"fight\" these feelings and act out charisma.\n\nAfter thinking about it a lot, I think the answer might be, essentially, a social \"mask\" or persona. I don't think this is dishonest, any more than wearing appropriate shoes is dishonestly hiding my real feet, as long as I don't mistake the social personality for my real one.\n\nRather than having to \"act happy\" even though I'm not *over and over* which is exhausting and scary, I feel this would be a lot easier, like just flipping a switch and running a program. This would reduce the energy cost a lot.\n\nAnother benefit is to feel safer. Right now, if someone seems uninterested in me, it's like they're reflecting my true self (even though they don't know me) and it hurts a lot. With a persona, I wouldn't feel as exposed. If I meet someone who I seem to like, I could show my \"real\" feelings a little bit at a time to see if I can trust them.\n\nThe problem is I don't actually know how to do this. It seems like some people learn this naturally when they're very young, and I'm no longer that young.\n\nTLDR: does anyone have tips for how to develop a social personality to feel safer, act more charismatic, and reduce the energy cost of social interaction?",

        "text": "Hey everyone. I was the only child of divorced parents. I went through multiple moves and several school transfers. To say I stuck to myself as a kid would be an understatement. I was quiet and extremely reserved when I was young.\n\nI tried to come out of my shell during high school. I overcompensated in college. And I finally found a good balance in my late twenties. I am now thriving and feel very blessed to be surrounded by dozens of friends, a few lifelong brothers, and weekly social events.\n\nLearning to socialize was a skill I had to develop. It doesn’t matter if you’re introverted or extroverted, shy or extravagant, grumpy or sweet. You can enjoy the benefits of socializing in your own way and at your own pace.\n\nInvesting in the lives of others and letting them into yours is a worthwhile endeavor. With a little bit of work, you can have a group of close friends to walk through life with. \n\n**Why socializing can be difficult, and how it can be improved:**\n\nLoneliness is a global struggle. Everyone has felt lonely at one time or another.\n\nThe cure is creating healthy connections with others. Unfortunately, connecting is difficult for many people. This is especially true for individuals with certain upbringings, personalities, and environments. If building relationships is painful, people often convince themselves they don’t need it. The lone wolf mindset is an optional method of survival, but it falls short. The truth is, it takes a community to thrive.\n\nThere is nothing negative about being quiet or enjoying solitude. Some of life’s greatest joys can be found within that environment. But your mental health will suffer if you don’t balance solitude with socializing. It is crucial to build close friendships and struggle through life together.\n\nSocializing means spending time with people you enjoy in a relaxed environment. Ideally, this happens in-person, based around a healthy activity, and with the same group of individuals.\n\nFor some people, socializing comes naturally. But, those same people may struggle with solo activities such as exercising, meditation, and other personal mental health skills. For others, socializing may feel difficult. Thankfully, it can be learned and enjoyed just like anything else.\n\nA good workout takes energy. You might be tired afterward. But you see exponential benefits over time, and you are always happy you did it. This is how socializing might feel when you first practice it.\n\nHere are my most broad pieces of advice, and I can try and offer some more detailed ideas in the comments if you want. I'm building an online mental health learning platform and I do a ton of research on these types of topics (plus my own experience).\n\n**1)** **Start by engaging in small talk with strangers and coworkers.**\n\nSome say small talk is “too shallow” or “boring.” But, that’s the point. Small talk is a simple back-and-forth “handshake” between two human beings who want to feel more comfortable with each other.\n\nThis “shallow” exchange is a way of looking for something to connect on, or to have “in common.” Commenting on the weather is one of the broadest ways to connect. To start small, practice initiating conversations that may seem silly to you right now.\n\n**2) Look for teamwork-based events.**\n\nFor those without a lot of social skills, standard parties and networking events can be draining. The only purpose of the activity is to socialize with strangers. There are other ways to begin fun relationships. Look for events based around a common goal. This might look like volunteering, sports teams, classes, or book clubs. A common goal makes it easier for organic friendships to grow.\n\n**3) Focus on building a few close friendships.**\n\nEven the best socializers have many acquaintances, but only a few close friends. Spend time and effort to find them. This means proactively inviting each other to events, keeping in touch, and eventually sharing your struggles. Finding the right people for you will make this back-and-forth exchange easier.\n\nThere are many common social cues, phrases, body language signals, and other topics of conversation to master. Studying these cues through books, videos, and interactions will improve your confidence and strengthen your mental health. When you feel comfortable socializing, be sure to include it as part of your new routine. \n\n**One of my favorite challenges:** \n\nWhen I want a little boost, I will shoot out a random text to a friend, or even someone I haven't heard from in a long time. \n\nSomething like, \"Hey, hope things are going well. Just thought I'd say hi. I've been doing \\*things\\*. Anything new with you? No worries if I don't hear from you, talk soon.\" \n\nPhrasing things in this way means I don't get offended if I don't hear from them. And I still reached out and did my part of making a connection. Usually, these turn into just 3-4 text exchanges. That's plenty, not everything has to go the distance. I do this with many people through the year. \n\nHope some of this helps you.",

Every time she passed by me she stared right into my eyes. Me being a anxious wreck looked away. \n\n\n\nThis continued, she looks at me, I look away (literally scared of her) \nI tried to squeeze past her and I swear she rubbed her butt against me, twice.\n\nI add her on facebook, she accepts immediately, despite her being active I chicken out of texting her.\n\nNext day, she again looks right into my eyes and I turn away.\n\n\nI text her with a \"hi :)\" on messenger and she doesnt read it, after an hour I send another text asking how she is and again its just seen.\n\n\nI'm thinking that she's not interested, ok then. The next day she again stares right into my eyes and I look away.\n\n\nToday she didn't look at me and I noticed she wasn't wearing makeup either, she looked sad.\n\n\nWas it all in my head or did my anxiety and fear ruin everything?",

        "text": "Recently, I was told that I lead people on from being too nice to people. I’ve always been very nice and understanding. I like talking to people, but it gets me into situations that negatively impact me and the person who I’m talking to. I don’t have any interest in being in a relationship at least right now, but my personality tends to attract people. I don’t like being mean or what I perceive as mean, and genuinely care about most of the people who I talk to. But it’s gotten to the point where they assume that I like them or I’m interested in them in someway. This in turn makes me nervous and not want to hang out with that person, so I start being a little more guarded, but then that feels off because I like talking to the people still. One of my friends says that I need to stop being a 😺 and learn to not interact with people who I don’t like(or change the way I interact with people) But I like people and getting to know people and I feel like for the people who I don’t wanna interact with I’ve already been nice to them so stopping would just be weird and make people think negatively about me and my character. A lot of it has to do with how people perceive me. And I don’t know how to not give a fuck about how people perceive me. I don’t want to dissociate and detach from people, as I feel that would just send me into a spiral of depression, but I also don’t want to continue with this behavior, as I am constantly at war with myself. If anyone has any suggestions, it would be very helpful. Thank you and have a great day.",

I am 36 years old and I'm still that shy, anxious kid I've always been. It's just really tough to accept. I just never seem to improve or grow as a human being (not just in terms of social skills, but everything in general). It really is depressing. Not to mention embarassing, I feel so bad after some social conversations, I know they think I'm strange and awkward, because I am. I know they talk about me in private and they aren't being mean or anything (nice folks), but probably just like \"what's his deal?\". It's so hard. I just want to be normal and be able to talk with others without constant fear and worry, and to enjoy spending time and chatting with others. I can't get over it, though. Even without the fear/anxiety/shyness, I would still be poor at conversation. I'll always be that shy/anxious 13 year old kid, no matter how much time goes on or how much I try to improve at things like social skills. I'll never be an adult",

It’s like they did everything they could to reject me without actually disowning me. They did not like me, and most of what I did was never enough.\n\nThis caused me to develop a codependent narcissist personality growing up, where I would be so desperate to prove my worth, and prove I had talents and skills that were better than everyone else’s. These were all survival mechanisms to keep from getting rejected.\n\nI have since gotten rid of these habits through years of hard work, but I still have low self worth and feel that I’ll never be appreciated no matter what I do.\n\nI have no idea what to do. I thought it was because I was ADHD, but there are plenty of ADHDers who get accepted so I’m not sure, it might be because something about my looks or my body language is unattractive and offputting.\n\nI have done my best to remain as realistic, fair, and positive with my attitudes toward people, which is why I’m just trying to fix the situation instead of taking everything out on people.\n\nAny advice helps.
