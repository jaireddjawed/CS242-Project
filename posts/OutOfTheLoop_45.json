He basically kidnapped a kid in two of his videos in one he tells his parents is taking him to a wedding but didn't tell them it was in Chicago and then in the other, he took the kid out of school without the parent's permission. And that's excluding the part in which he basically paid his father to do something stupid and the father ended up nude in front of the neighbor's kids for the second time. I don't know if I don't get the joke or if it's scripted. If someone could help me understand it would be great. \n\n[Video of the kid](https://youtube.com/shorts/awNpFlaj-Is?feature=share)\n\n[video of the father](https://youtube.com/shorts/HXKPu_ErxRE?feature=share)",
