Might it be related to the fact that I point my DNS to Cloudflare’s servers? Maybe something more nefarious? (I wouldn’t be surprised if it were the latter.)\n\nFor reference, I’ve replicated the same endpoints with separate packet captures, and the endpoints in question were captured on the Wi-Fi interface in promiscuous mode. As well, I’m properly pointed to my .mmdb GeoIP databases.\n\n//\n\nUPDATE: Not sure why I decided to post immediately before going on a busy business trip. Call it crappy forum decorum, weak OP game. I'm definitely not a vet' redditor. Genuinely sorry. \n\nAnyhow, things seem to have been fixed by the 2.6.1 update. Probably the same bug reported by Christopher Maynard (https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=14656) -- I replicated his results at least in the one proceeding example (see the Pastebin URL below) on my Mac. To wit:\n\nInitial/same pcap file I extracted the first endpoint report from, but post 2.6.1 Wireshark update (No VPN, Wi-Fi/en0 interface) -\nhttps://i.imgur.com/APV7H1i.png\n\nNew/fresh 2.6.1 pcap file (No VPN, Wi-Fi/en0 interface) - \nhttps://i.imgur.com/ZzPnZwm.png\n\nBug replication output - https://pastebin.com/nmTkXqyc  \n\nI used 13.107.3.128 in my replication, whose endpoint had initially been reported (i.e., in the output I took that first ghetto pic of) as being Berkeley, USA, AS#16, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. I ran mmdbresolve and confirmed the 'normal' packet endpoint details as Redmond, USA, AS#8068, Microsoft; when I reversed the octets, I got Berkeley.\n \n",

Although all the data is backupped, the backup drive is connected to the same computer, so ransomware could easily encrypt all the data on it as well.\n\nWhat's the best **user-friendly** way to make sure it's safe? I was thinking about some physical switch, which would disconnect the hard drive from computer, but I'm not sure, if it's safe to suddenly just disconnect the hard drive. And also I'm not an electronics guy, so I don't want to make a switch myself, I'm hoping for something I could just buy in some online store like Amazon, AliExpress or anything else. Also I thought about switch which would just disable writing to this drive, it could be safer, because I won't just take the power source. It will gain more power on hours though.\n\nYou may ask, why I won't just use a NAS. The answer is simple, I'm low on budget and using cheap one-board computers isn't really good solution in terms of performance.\n\nThanks for any help.",

All walls are plaster and in pristine condition so for now I do not want to break holes.\n\nAnyway; we have coax spread throughout and the previous owner had Comcast Xfinity which we also had and transferred over from our old home.\n\nQuestion is I have been reading about MoCa and am considering it as the solution for all this.  My set-up is as follows:\n\nMain coax comes into basement; two splitters are already down there (Proformance VSA-604C and Antronix CMC2003H-A) taking five lines all through the home.  The lines are in great shape and all labeled by Comast (done within the past year) so I feel confident about those.\n\nI have an Arris Surfboard SVG2482AC modem and an Asus AC3200 Tri-Band Gigabit Router...both are connected and working right now but not necessarily in the place we want them.\n\nQuestion is what is the best route?  I am down to either the Motorola MoCa adapters (2.0 Gigabit) or the Actiontecs....I know I will need multiple pairs but am trying to understand the true configuration and whether this will work.  I subscribe to 150mB service and we are getting close to that on the hard line so that is what I want to keep throughout the house or near it.\n\nDo I need to have a moca adapter on the main coming in and do everything in pairs?  Do I need a moca filter?\n\nI have read my modem and Comcast service is already Moca...is it true?\n\nI have the big X1 box as my main and two satellite XiD-P boxes for the other two tvs in the house.\n\nThank you in advance.\n\n",

I could go on for days.\n\nI'm trying to make my team's job a little easier by finding a way to have a sort of single pane of glass for the threat intel we use. Here's what I've found so far that looks like it does what I'm looking for:\n\n* GOSINT\n* MISP\n* OSTrICa (not supported anymore, tho)\n* CRITs\n* Palo Alto's MineMeld\n* TheHive Project\n\nHowever these solutions all do way more than what I'm wanting to start with, and to get hands on with them all would take awhile. I'm talking simple like a web GUI with an IP/domain/URL search box that you put a simple query into, and it returns relevant data from the sources you select. I would build one myself, but I don't have a clue about web development. I kind of created this with an ELK stack that pulls the intel from the sources and parses them, but there's a lot of manual configuration there that frankly I'm not willing to do for what I get paid.\n\nAny input is appreciated, thanks guys!",

        "text": "I'm not anticipating a lot of upvotes for this as it is going against the grain, but well over a year ago I went through PWK and got my OSCP, and I thought I was ready for anything. I got hired as a security consultant around the time of completion of PWK, doing pentests and risk assessments. What I learned since then, is that the OSCP is not the end-all certification to get if you want to get started in this career (not that there is one anyways). This sub and a few other infosec subs preach the OSCP like it's the golden ticket to a job, when in reality the course doesn't even teach you the most essential component for pentesting a domain. \n\nThe biggest hole in PWK that OffSec fails to plug is they teach almost nothing about pentesting Active Directory. I challenge you to find a pentester who won't say 99% of the domains they pentest aren't using AD because it's just way too common. When I first started learning about pentesting and doing VMs on Vulnhub to prep for the OSCP, I didn't realize at the time, but it's just basically a glorified CTF certification. There's so many odd and borderline stupid trials in PWK, that looking back, it's not applicable at all in the real world. \n\nExample: In PWK, there was a machine that was a password manager and had a web app component. In the PHP comments was a base64 encoded admin password. \n\nAnother example: In PWK you're taught how to do a buffer overflow on a program that doesn't use ASLR or DEP. It's 2018, no new program is not going to use DEP and ASLR and likely any program that isn't using DEP and ASLR already has a published exploit. \n\nLet's be honest though, the OSCP is a well respected certification because it's one of the few that requires actual demonstration of knowledge instead of memorizing text from a textbook. I see more certifications becoming like this and hopefully employers start to recognize them. Let me be clear as well, because while I'm bashing the OSCP I don't want to tell you it's worthless because it's far from worthless. It teaches the fundamentals of pentesting in general, how to use the most common tools and look for exploits the correct way. I just wish they would update it so it reflects what a real pentest looks like. From what I've seen as well, PWK is one of the cheapest courses out there, making it the best bang for your buck. I just want people to realize that just because you passed the OSCP doesn't mean you can start pentesting tomorrow, because I learned that the hard way. ",

I've recorded the packets transferred between the program and the server, when the program is checking if there is connection. I've saved the response data from the server directly to a file in hex. In the system hosts file, I redirected the remote server address to [127.0.0.1](https://127.0.0.1), and created a python server to listen for the request, and send the recorded response back (as if the remote server had sent it)\n\n**Problem**\n\nIt doesn't work. The target program keeps giving me errors even though from what I can see, the data that my server responds with is identical to the data the original server responds with.\n\nHere is the snippet from the python code responsible for sending the data:\n\n    print(\"\\nSoftware is checking for internet connection\")\n    print(\"\\nSending response\")\n    connTest = open(\"connTest.txt\", \"r\").read() // Data is saved in HEX, to ensure not a byte is missed\n    conn.send(bytes.fromhex(connTest))    // Send the response back to the program\n    print(\"Sending: \\n\" + str(bytes.fromhex(connTest)))\n\nAny ideas will be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.\n\nEDIT: fixed. The problem was the http response was clone too closely from the server, and the timestamp was not changed to fit the new time. ",

        "text": "I am currently unemployed and on an extended trip of sorts that's going to last another month. After this, I plan to look for a job in IT, though I'm specifically hoping for a role as a security analyst. I'm wondering what would be the best way to build my security resume in the month I have remaining. At the moment I have my associates degree in university studies, CompTIA A+, and CompTIA Security+. I also have MTA certs for \u0014Software Development and HTML5 (I know these are kind of useless but I was offered the chance to take them for free.) I have 1 year of experience programming and maintaining a system using Arduino microcontrollers for a local business. I have more than 3 years of work experience besides that but everything else is not technical high school jobs. Up until now I was planning on completing my CCNA R&amp;S with the time I have left but I'm realizing that might be a bit of a lofty goal and possibly not the best use of my time anyway. As a side note I'm planning on starting a batchelo\u0014rs degree with WGU once I have a job.\n\nSo my question is with the qualifications I listed above, what can I do that will give me the best shot at an analyst position? I'm open to certifications or unstructured study, whatever I can get to give me an edge. I actually just graduated high school (I earned my associates at the same time), so I'm worried that potential employers will skip over me for lack of a more professional work atmosphere, so any tips there would help too. I'm going to be looking in the Salt Lake City area. From what I've seen they have a fair number of low level analyst positions, but I also have to acknowledge that it's more than likely that I won't get the job I want. So assuming I do fall short of a position as a security analyst, what would you recommend?\n\nTL;DR : I have an AS degree, some low level certs, and 1 month of spare time. How do I prepare to apply for security analyst positions?",

To stay sane during this time, I connected my macbook to the internet using my phone as a modem (wifi hotspot).\n\nA couple of hours later I got an email message that my Hulu password was changed and I noticed weird stuff happening, such as my phone saying there was 2 users on my iPhone, not the one macbook as the sole device for connection.\n\nThis led me to learn that I was being hacked via macos' ScreenSharing function, and that someone was remotely screensharing and manipulating my PC. My email, Hulu and a couple of other tabs were open, but that should be it.\n\nThey attempted to change my Hulu password, and I of course turned off ANY screensharing options.\n\nHow can I ensure that I am not trojanned or anything at this time, aside from a full wipe? I'm going to use wireshark to monitor suspicious traffic.\n\nThanks!",

(Except for reading http plain texts passwords and what not but every major internet service uses https exclusively)\n\nChrome uses its own DNS servers so you can’t spoof them. It only allows secure SSL connections if the website has it, and it detects ssl strip and blocks http connections where https is available. \n\nMore about it in this article: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-chrome-will-soon-warn-you-of-software-that-performs-mitm-attacks/\n\nWith my very limited knowledge of netsec I tried it on myself and indeed I could not find a way to get the client to connect to my site, chrome blocked it no matter what I did with a massive red “ATTACKERS MIGHT BE TRYING TO STEAL INFO”.\n\n\nAm I missing something is there some way around these things? Or am I right and it this attack not much of a thing anymore? Just to be specific I’m talking about password harvesting type attacks with fake sites you control. Any suggestions appreciated.

Not sure if I should learn sourcefire and ELK or the full Sec Onion suite. \n\nWould deploying Sec Onion in an environment with sourcefire be redundant? Would learning the tools in Sec Onion make me a better security analyst? Just starting to learn what these tools do. ",

If this is how it is being done, is there any way I could go about proving that it's happening, because they aren't going to admit it unless I have evidence. \n\nAlso, would just using end to end encrypted services prevent this?",

Even after I rejected the interview initially (about 3 weeks ago) the SOC director and Intel VP still wanted to go through the interviewing process. I have the first for real phone interview tomorrow and wanted to collect some info before the next steps in the process.\n\n* **Given the brief job description above, what are some other names this position might go by?**\n* **If you are able to find the info yourself, what is the salary range for such a position?** I'm trying to set reasonable expectations and prepare myself with a number should I be force to name the first price.\n\n**Edit**\n\nWhat certification should I pursue next?\n\n**Edit 2** \n\ninterview got pushed to wednesday.
