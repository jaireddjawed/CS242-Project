It was a pretty out of control situation with a neighbor having a full on tantrum on our property. This all would have usually sent me into total panic mode. I was pissed and had the adrenaline that sort of goes with it, but not the total fear-panic I usually get with any sort of confrontation. This tantrum had clearly upset and angered everyone in the house and was pretty violent so I called the police  to diffuse it (go calm down out of control neighbor). They took a report and assured us that both what set this person off and their inappropriate reaction were law violations on their part, not ours. \n\nUsually this kind of thing would make me just shut down for days and be unable to do anything even though I wasn't directly in the confrontation.

        "text": "Hey all. So I'm currently processing the experience of going to therapy with my mother. It was predictably horrendous, which has actually been validating. Although I did briefly worry that it was my fault she'd got worse, I'm thinking that's not my responsibility. Don't set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm, right? Especially if it's someone who won't even notice that you're burning?\n\nHere's the back story if you're curious:\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/54ow50/update_i_went_to_therapy_with_my_mother_it_was/\n\nSo I'm still processing this and my aunt picks this moment to email me (my family of origin are Jewish and it's new year - I am not so please don't wish me happy new year, thanks).\n\nHere is the email. It looks innocuous. \n\n*I want to wish you all the very best - health and happiness - for the New Year. I often think of you, and hope that you are well, and feel less alone than when you wrote to me last winter. You can be in touch with me at any time - please\nknow that. Maybe it would be easier by phone; if you would send me your phone number, I would of course call you. In the meantime, my warm wishes to you and [husband], and love from [aunt]*\n\nSeems fine, right? Except here are the previous two emails she sent me. I wrote to her last year saying I had gone NC. Having been the one person ever to call my parents out on being abusive I thought she'd understand and have my back. She's not even married to my uncle (mother's brother) any more but is evidently still drinking the Kool-aid. I got the following two emails. I never replied.\n\nEmail 1:\n\n\"Where do I start? I think I'll write as if we were sitting down together and discussing your situation. My first response would be: what help might you want from me? What can I do? Having read and re-read your email, some things are still not clear to me, and it would help me understand what's going on with you if you could clarify them. For instance, I'm not sure if you are still in touch with [my brother and his wife and kids].\n\nAs far as parents are concerned - any parents, not only yours - they make mistakes, many mistakes! The trouble with parenthood is that one gets no practice for it, no rehearsals, you begin it in real time; also, each child is a different entity, a different world. But whatever parents' shortcomings, they do their best. Yes, they may fail, fall short of what the child thinks they should be doing. I'm sure a lot of children, in childhood and adulthood, feel a lot of anger towards their parents. But there comes a time, when we just have to move on, otherwise the anger takes over our lives.\n\nI have no idea what specifically has happened between you and your parents - either in the past or now, ie, what was the straw which broke the camel's back to such an extent that you say you have had to give up having any kind of relationship with your parents. Is there really no alternative? Could you perhaps see them less rather than not at all? \n\nI'm going to be quite blunt now: your parents are not going to \"undergo a personality transplant\". Why should they? I'm glad you have a nice family of in-laws even though, as you say, it's not the same. [[I know they're not. That was my point: I can't change them even if I want to. Why should they? Because they are abusive narcissists?!]]\n\nSo, what can you do to make the family you were born into the family you want? [[I can't.]] How can it help to cut yourself off from them? [[It helps by meaning I don't spend time with abusive people who treat me like I don't matter.]] Doesn't that create the isolation ? Do you have access to a competent therapist who can help you with all this?\n\nMy phone no. is [removed] if you would like to talk. In the meantime, please be in touch and tell me what you might need from me.\"\n\nEmail 2:\n\n\"With best wishes for a very happy birthday today, and health and happiness, love and friendship, throughout the year.\nI remember the announcement of your birth that we received at [removed]. I also have some lovely photos of you as a baby and small child, and some very happy and thankful letters from your mother describing how beautiful you were, and how pleased [GCbro] was with his sister.\nWith love, and wondering how you are. Please be in touch. What's your phone number?I can call you.\"\n\n(Oh so my mother was happy when I was born? Gosh, that changes everything then?)\n\nOne of my own personal litmus tests for toxic behaviour is people who send me emails that pretend everything is fine and I'm not ignoring them. If I had sent someone an email like the first one, I wouldn't just carry on like I hadn't, I would get that I had upset them. But I wouldn't send that at all, so...\n\nI'm going to have to block her emails, aren't I? \n\nI have a mental wellness plan at work that lists contact from my family of origin as one of my triggers. So I could tell my manager about this - but not the content, as it sounds okay on paper. My husband gets it but right now I really just need to speak to more people who get it. So I really hope you all understand that this latest missive isn't the nice email it is masquerading as. Support appreciated, thank you.  ",

        "text": "Some background: Nmom made my life hell throughout my childhood and even throughout college, you know the typical RBN stuff. After college I was determined to escape so I got a high-paying job and moved to the other side of the country. For the first few years I was very low contact- not answering calls by saying I was busy with work, visiting maybe once a year but only for 1 night with the excuse that I was \"busy with work\", and was very very careful to not give her back any of the control that she previously held over my life. Since she no longer had any leverage to control me I would not hesitate to hang up on her and refuse to answer the phone for months if she started screaming at me over the phone or would try to employ other N tactics. When I visit my home town I will visit my dad and adult siblings and will just not tell her I'm visiting (parents divorced when I was a teenager). \n\n\nI guess all this must have gotten through to her somehow because over time it started getting to where when we talk on the phone it is actually very normal and pleasant- it makes me very cautious since it's a complete 180 from how things used to be. It's been this way for a bout a year. \n\n\nI wonder if this change is because I have finally moved from \"indsider\" to \"outsider\" in her mind. You know how on the outside everyone thinks Ns are amazing and kind people while they are actually terrorizing those closest to them? Perhaps I have distanced myself from her for so long that she realizes she can no longer be her true self around me and has to put on her \"outside\" face when dealing with me.\n\n\nI am still very very careful around her and refuse to be tricked into thinking that I can have a normal parent relationship with her. But it does seem promising that we are now capable of something resembling a normal phone conversation which has never been possible before. I haven't seen her in over a year and she mentioned visiting for Christmas and I am thinking about giving her this one chance to test the waters in our “new” relationship. I will book her travel and lodging so will make her stay 3 days max, and have also told her I will need to work over the Christmas weekend- which is a lie, but gives me an out to escape if things get too heated. I’m well aware of what could go wrong but I feel like I’ve carefully mitigated the risks, and if it ends up being miserable (which could be likely, I'll admit) then I will just vow to never host her again and there's really nothing she can do about it. \n\n\nHas this happened to anyone else? Does my mom's change have any hint of genuineness or is she just going for the long con? Am I an idiot to let her come visit?\n\n",

They just wanted sympathy and seriously, what is wrong with everyone? Oh what a humbling feeling when it all came crashing down. \n\nI am from a large family. We used to be Mormon...what a joke. Not the religion, just the passing phase it turned out to be for my ndad. Every 10 years or so he switches his life, his wife, his job, his interests, his \"friends.\" We stopped going to church following the first divorce (I was seven) with zero explanation. Ok, sort out that traumatizing event as much as possible with an ailing mother who suffered from a genetic neurodegenerative disease (that is all honestly a whole other story in itself, but as you can see the complications are piling). Thank god for a game changing step mom. She literally changed our lives. Once my ndad was done with her, he left her for a younger wife and left my (ex) step mom to raise us (now I was sixteen) because my mom was too sick (he never once offered financial or emotional support to her or us as we kids took care of every need for our mom until she died). He just did this whole thing yet again (btw of course adultery began each new life for him because god forbid he be alone for 3 seconds) and ruined a family, that family split and now he's with her and her two daughters who were my age when he left us for tne second time (while in the house as minors). This sounds so crazy to type out. Sadly the truly hurtful things aren't even the actions but the lack of remose or morsel of responsibilty. It's actually maddening. Now he's busy trying to seem incredibly talented and gifted and condescending as hell on fb and whatever facade he calls his life. \n\nIt took me until my twenties to realize in my own, obviously, that I suffered from daily generalized and social anxiety. How can such an epiphany also be so painstakingly obvious? Well, I think most things from my childhood went unnoticed. \n\nOver the years l kept asking myself, seriously what is WRONG with him? Who acts like this? I just recently started researching true narcissistic personality disorder and again, ephipany ensues. So clear, but so hard to put such a disasteruous parent into that \"box.\" I've found that once I did, things just became so much easier for me. \n\nNice to sort things out and have a place to vent such as this.",

        "text": "I'm writing here because it feels like this subreddit is the only group that will really truly understand the way I'm feeling right now. For the majority of my life I was kept at least in part in an endless loop of guilt and pain by my nmom and family. To be fair, I'm not sure thy they even realize what they are doing fully. I just now when I got into the relationship that I've been in the past year and a half that I wanted to step away from that.\n\nOf course not having the full range of coping skills one develops from a nurturing upbringing it's been super hard to get off the ground when tragedy hits such as all of a sudden losing a job and having no savings and having to relocate. I owe the last year and a half of emotional peace and growth to my partner. It's hard really to express how much it's meant to have that. Though now, as of Sunday I don't. \n\nAfter a year and a half of watching me and supporting me as I crawl up from all this, it's just become overwhelming for him to continue to be my primary support system. It's understandable but really also a tremendous blow. Here I am a woman in her 30s with all these dreams of finishing school (a masters in mental health) and now finally managing a full time job where my boss is generally positive (though not really paying as well as I need) who finally believed she was setting her life back up and realizing how far she's gone having to step on the breaks. \n\nIt's like no matter how much I think I've been winning or improving my circumstances I'm still going to be alone and without a parachute. I have some months to get things together but here in the first week I'm back to no sleep and barely wanting food. \n\nA defense of mine from the years of abuse is having starved myself as an anorexic at a few milestone moments in my life. It feels like I'm going into battle again and I'm a little freaked out because this time I really don't want to reach out to a family that isn't really there for me because everyone tells you that's where you go. \n\nJust about a year ago my nmom destroyed me emotionally in front of this man. The last thing I want to do is go back and say it finally blew up in my face because I couldn't get on top of my finances fast enough. And that is really what it comes down to now. Being rejected because I am too much of a financial risk just really really stings. ",

I am on okay terms with her (I mean there was no huge fight that drove us apart, we just don't really speak often, maybe every other month) but I still can't move past everything.\n\n\nWhen I first moved out almost a year and a half ago it all started to hit me how awful everything was. I really, really struggled. I knew it was bad and I was unhappy but finally being physically distanced from my family, I finally had time to process all of my trauma. I had just moved in with my now-fiancé and he could hardly handle me. I was a mess, picking fights all the time, crying all the time, just completely insecure. All I could do was stay up all night and read RBN and my old journals and read about PTSD and think WTF. SERIOUSLY WTF and curl up in the bathroom and bawl my eyes out, wondering why nobody had every saved me or helped me or anything. \n\n\nSo slowly with time, I don't know I just feel better. Got my anxiety meds upped every a few times, I'm at a comfortable dose now where I feel like a person. I still feel like I can't trust my fiancé. When we first moved in together I couldn't sleep if he was awake. He has a weird sleep schedule (still does) but my God, when I would have to be up early, he would curl up into bed with me, \"pretend\" to be going to sleep with me (I'd know he was pretending), and then get up and work on schoolwork. He'd have to put me to bed like a damn baby because I was incapable and scared of sleeping with people being awake around me. I'd wake up sometimes and lose my mind, I thought he was cheating, I thought he was sneaking out, etc. \n\n\nI'd go through his email, constantly. A few months after we moved in, I found out he was flirting and talking sexually to some girl like the week we moved in together. I literally still can't move past this. Every time I think about it I want to die. He didn't have sex with her, but I feel so awful. Just thinking about this I want to tear apart his computer and find proof that he's being untrue. I need some kind of proof because there's no fucking way he could love me. I still have literally no self-esteem. We had a rocky past before we moved in together (he had some issues of his own as well that just went away with age and time), but he takes such good care of me, and in the last year and a half he's never been untrue to me. Besides when I was an emotional mess for a few months and I kept him up crying and screaming and fighting half the time, and he wanted to leave (don't blame him) he's been a constant support. Even when we fight, we resolve things quickly. He knows I'm sensitive, and we communicate and apologize after arguments. But I get insecure A LOT. Only time we fight is when I get insecure. \n\nI don't know if I'll ever have self-esteem. Every time I see another woman who's mildly attractive, all I can think is how disgusting I am, how he'd rather be with her, what can I do to look like that, I'll never look like that, etc. Honestly I just hate myself and even when he's kind and sweet and caring I worry it's to cover up an affair so I don't get suspicious. I don't believe I deserve any kind of love. And the way I act, and put my feelings on to him to deal with, and make it his responsibility to take care of me is the shittiest thing ever, even though he says it makes him happy to take care of me, it makes me feel so guilty and awful, like I'm a narcissist myself.\n",

        "text": "My SO and I have never been able to connect on self-esteem. I am getting better at raising mine, and being kind to myself. But I'll say things like \"it's just that old feeling that I don't deserve it,\" and they don't understand. I'll say \"I get this feeling that no one likes me, but I know it's not true,\" and I'll ask if they feel the same ever, they say \"nope.\" \n\nThey have ordinary self-esteem issues here and there, but it's not chronically lowered. They believe they will achieve great things in life, deserve love, and that things may not be fair in life, but they'll prevail and can work hard to obtain their goals. They don't seem plagued with self-doubt, or they have it amazingly well-hidden. \n\nSo this leads to the next thing: validation and comfort. I get the strange feeling that my SO doesn't need my validation or comfort, and that they see me as weak for wanting it. That last part is my own projection, but I will say that for whatever reason, they don't provide it to me very often. And when I volunteer it to them, they don't seem to need it or want it at all. Sometimes they look at me like I'm being strange when I comfort them (in times when it seems natural for me to do). \n\nI was wondering is this is common of people not exposed to narcissism? ",

It was a dumb accident, no one's fault. Just happened.\n\nLong story short, I needed surgery, and have been off work. Last week my doctor released me to light duty. I came in, and was told I would help out the guys in the shop with computer work.\n\nI feel *so* awkward in there. I don't know much about how everything works, because I was still in training when I got hurt. The first day they showed me where to file the daily logs for each bus that is repaired. So I come in and file those every day. But because I'm doing them every day, they don't get backed up. Then I go ask the shop supervisor what he wants me to do next. \n\nThat's where things get bad. I know he has his stuff to do, but I don't know what I'm supposed to do. If he gives me something, I work on it as long as I can. But eventually I run out of numbers to enter, or files to organize, or things to label. I feel like every time I walk into his office to tell him I finished something, he looks really mad. Yesterday I suggested that I could clean out one file cabinet, and he liked the idea. But it only lasted a day. I feel like I'm bothering him so much by asking for my next job. \n\nIt doesn't help that there's a new computer system that they can't figure out. So he doesn't know how to print off reports and such for me to enter the numbers for. I even over heard him telling someone he tried to get me moved to another area, but they said no. I makes me feel like I just never want to go back. I feel like crying every time I finish a job.",

Sensing my coldness, yesterday she starting pushing it but it was late and I finished the conversation. Today after I told her about the new job, she's been bombing my phone with texts about every single mistake I've made in my life, telling me about all the \"sacrifices\" she did for me, the ungrateful. She *made* me study piano and ballet professionally until I was eighteen even though I kept asking her to not do it anymore, so it's sacrifices she chose! \n\nI really need some advice on how to put boundaries on her texting.  I'm not sure how to grey rock her over text, she'll know what I'm up to, she knows me too well. I can't go NC as much as I would love to. And her stories are so twisted there's no point in correcting or debating anything. Any tips would be nice. Sorry for the long post!",

The big difference is that you can break up with a cheater, but breaking up with a nparent isn't as easy. Plenty of us are NC with nparents, but you always have that hole.

So I changed my method to state \"I rock him a little softer and he goes right out,\" and this is taken as criticism. Her mother turned her against me by calling me a \"self-righteous asshole\" and that I was controlling...\n\nWe moved to Florida, partly to gain independence, but her mother was threatened. So...there was a guilt trip. \"You've taken my baby away,\" basically...the mother once told me not to, saying that she would die if I took them away...I told her to pray.\n\n So she encouraged us to go, and two months passed in Florida, and she came to buy a plane ticket for my baby. Her daughter drove and took the dogs. They live in Texas now. My son is perceived as born from sin and living in sin...he's a two-year-old...and this family has taken him to raise him. I will be present in his life...but I fear the fear they will use to brainwash him...\n\nI realize I may live with some paranoia...but this woman, the Christian Narcissist, believes this world is a prison...and she has a death wish...so she can go to heaven. I fear she will stop at nothing to see I am in a living hell...and that my baby fears this hell...because the only way to fear it is to make it real for him. How do I keep my child from fear? \n\nI don't believe they're extremists, but they are Christian fundamentalists...and using spirituality, her mother has had control of her whole life...it's why she hates school and is fine living with them now...and they have a nice big house, but...it's not a \"home.\"\n",

        "text": "I. Am. So. Fucking. Done. \n\nYou guys know our nanny drama (if you want a refresher check my profile posts). It continues. \n\nToday the nanny we had the last week and a half was fired because she lied to us amongst other small red flags and issues. She violated the contract numerous times. She cause my husband to miss work one day and me be super late another and kinda late today. The list goes on. So we gave her a termination letter today with half of the rate because she barely, if at all, did half the job. We had every right to not pay her at all but because we are good people, we paid her for what she did. In the letter it even said if she accepts the money than she is accepting that this is all she will get from us and that she has no recourse to get more. That the relationship is done. The letter also explained why she was being terminated. She took the money and our house key and left the letter. My husband has it all recorded. She then sent me a barrage of harassing messages. I kept requesting the key back and she kept sending me nasty messages. She eventually called the cops on us and they told her they could do nothing. She could take it to small claims but that's it (&amp;amp; honestly she has no case or leg to stand on so I'm not worried IF it gets to that). They talked to us and told us if she doesn't return or key we can report it as stolen property and she'll have a warrant for arrest. It also turns out that she told the sheriff that she's 17 and she told us she's 18. So I have no idea what her real age is. Hopefully the sheriff will figure it out. \n\nI had googled her, checked her references, etc. I didn't pay for a background check which I will do from now on. Thankfully my kids are ok. I did my due diligence and I still got screwed over. I had found her through a group on fb bc I was desperate. Now I'm exhausted and angry. I feel like the worst parent ever. \n\nUpdate/edit: I tagged this post as support because I was basically having an anxiety attack and posting here without judgment helps me a lot. It's a useful coping skill for me. I didn't include all the other things I do, things I considered, etc to provide context. I didn't feel like I had to explain or justify myself. There have been a lot of judgmental, harsh and aggressive responses mixed in with the supportive ones. Trust me- I feel so guilty and responsible for the shit storm we have been dealing with the last month-probably more than I should. I know I made mistakes and bad choices. I learned a lot from this situation and the others I've been dealing with. I'm human and I make mistakes. I've done the best I could considering my anxiety was the highest it's been in years and I didn't know what to trust or believe. I've had other things going on in my life too that have doubly increased my anxiety. I'm doing my best and getting help and support. And as soon as I realized my mistakes, we got our kids out of there. And then I've beaten myself up for it. I didn't come here for advice or judgment. If I wanted either I'd go to my therapist or my nparents. I came here for support. We all go through bad seasons where things just go to shit because of our choices, because others make bad choices or behave badly, and/or because the universe just fucks with us. I'm taking my responsibility in this bad season (&amp; probably more than is really mine). Im working so hard to get out of a major rough patch in my life. I'm just very saddened and disappointed that I came here for support and I'm met with judgement. I thank those who have offered support and empathy. It has helped me from literally not having a mental break down. A person can only take so much. ",

I also assured her that I would make every effort to take my lunch as she has required (which is not the law). \n\nAnyways she responded with calling a meeting tomorrow to discuss my caseload and responsibilities. She hinted that I have a lack in my time management skills. (Which couldn't be further from the truth). I responded saying I had no problem meeting her as long as my direct supervisor could be there. She eventually acquiesced. So that makes me feel a lot better. I know I haven't done anything wrong. She's mad that I want to work through my lunch and take flex for my weekly dr (therapy) appointments. She's mad that I've asked questions about how she specifically wants things done. She's trying to flex her power\n\nAnd it's making me nauseous, anxious and exhausted. Though it's not triggering a shut down of my system like normal. I also have documentation that I have been compliant and respectful. But still...\n\nAnd we have had a million other things happen today. Our new nanny lied to us, has either missed work or has been super late (which is where the lie came in to place). Our power accidentally got turned off. My therapist is having issues with my insurance &amp;amp; it just seems like the world is shitting on me today. \n\nI'll take all the hugs",

He painted himself as this sad little puppy who lost his high school sweet heart after she cheated on him. The first two years we spent together were the happiest I had ever been. There were issues here or there, his ex would text him or school would be over whelming, but I thought we were happy.\n2 years into the relationship, J's lies started to unravel when his ex confessed to me they had been having an affair for the past six months. He swore she was lying, trying to break us up. He said there was no proof, and he was right, there was none. So I decided to believe him, stupidly. At this time, he dropped out of school and could not keep a job. He must of gone through 5-6 jobs at this point. Six months later, he disappeared. Randomly, cut contact from me. I begged him to contact me, with no words. After some time passed, he showed up in my life again. He would come over tell me sweet things, we would have sex, and then he would leave. Eventually, we started a relationship again.\nOne day, months into starting again, while I was on a skype call for an internship meeting, my laptop crashed. I grabbed his laptop and restarted my skype call. While on this call, I found messages between him and several other girls. He had been cheating on me. Sexting women, slept with one. I grabbed all my stuff and left. When he found out I left him, he started threatening to kill himself . He told me he knew he was mentally ill and needed help. So I stayed. I was scared of him killing himself. I really believed he would do it. I tried to leave several more times after this, all resulting in him threatening to kill himself. He would have violent outbursts at inanimate objects, but never at me. I watched throw a shoe at a laptop, throw a laptop out a window, slam his head into a wall, etc. He started believing in conspiracy theories and still could not keep a job.\nIn November of 2014, I found my father dead in the garage. He had a heart attack. I tried to save him but it was too late. He was my best friend. At this time, I was diagnosed with panic disorder and PTSD and put on medication. I was pulling my hair out, I wasn't leaving my bed. Five months later, somehow, I manage still to graduate college. A week after I graduated, I found out again, that J was having an affair again. I kicked him out of my apartment and blocked him from every aspect of my life. I was a wreck, trying to put my life together after losing my father. I would have flash backs to finding him in the garage. I was at my wits end.\nI dated someone else for about 6 months. We simply weren't compatible. J tried to contact me during this time. I did not let him. Eventually, J was taken to a mental institution.\nAfter I broke up my new relationship, I went off my medication. J contacted me again and told me all about his epiphanies and how he wanted to spend the rest of his life proving he changed. So I let him, I stilled loved him dearly. And for 6 months, we weren't the happiest but I thought we were stable. He kept a job the entire time and started talking about trade school. I would have days where I would just be so mad about everything he did in the past. I would find out lies he had told me. For example, I discovered all the beginning of our relationship was a lie. He cheated on his ex a multitude of times and then randomly left her one day, never even broke up with her. He started pursuing me, leaving his ex to believe he was cheating on her with me. He did drugs I never knew about. He did online stripping for a time. I would get so angry I would tell him I didn't want him in my life.\nSo now, here I am. Hes gone and he has starting dating an eighteen year old. He is 8 years older than her. I have started therapy and counseling. I'm a conglomerate mess because I don't know how to feel about it all. I ask myself if he will be much happier with her, if he really changed and I just couldn't get past all the history. He has tried to sext me a few times, so he has likely not changed. He has told me he is still in love with me but she makes him happy because they have no bad history. I'm just a mess and I'm trying to move forward and feel like I made the right decision.",

I just want a new address that I know my parents won't have.  (They live 2 hours away, so I'm not too concerned about running into them at the grocery store.)  I don't intend to give the new address to anyone they have contact with, including my extended family.  \n\nI'm currently in therapy, and I know that at some point my PTS symptoms might get better, but I'm not sure if it's worth it to live through all the fear and panic in the meantime.  I'd be really grateful for any advice or insight from someone who's been in a similar situation.  Thanks!\n\nTL;DR - I recently recovered memories of my dad sexually abusing me, and now I want to move to a different house so that I won't panic every time the doorbell rings.\n\n* Cross-posted to /r/adultsurvivors\n\n***EDIT:  Thank you everyone for your advice!!  I appreciate it very much.  I guess I'll probably start by talking to my therapist (and maybe getting some better locks).",

I had a really good conversation with my future SIL (My brother has been NC for years) and I realized I had no reason not to. So January 2016 was the last time I answered the phone for her.\nSince then, for the most part I've had A FANTASTIC year. I've only seen her twice.\n\nOnce at an event I attend annually. I knew there was a 50/50 chance of her being there but I don't want organize my life around her or miss out on things just because I know she'll be there. She came up to me with a 'hey stranger!' and a big smile. I was polite as I could muster answered a couple of questions vaguely and excused myself. She found me again later on and tried to pull me aside 'can I please talk to you' and i said no and walked away. It felt great, I know she could only irritate me and cause me unnecessary stress with a conversation. She's a pathological liar so I can't believe a word she says anyway.\n\nThe second time was yesterday. I have maintained a relationship with my grandmother through this and was visiting her when my Nmom came over. I was polite again and found a reason to escape soon after. Then managed to drive home this morning without her dropping by. Of course this is followed by texts and voicemails. 'why did you leave without saying something? I have something for you and [husband]! It was all wrapped and everything!'\n\nI've ignored it all (probably shouldn't have even listened to the voicemail) but I was wondering from those who have been NC/LC for longer than 9 months... does it stop? Do they get the hint? Will she every understand I don't want her in my life? I can only imagine how she's going to try and wiggle her way back in if the time comes I'm pregnant!\n\n\nTLDR: NC since January, when do the voicemails/texts/unwanted gifts stop? Is it even worth it to try and have a NC conversation with her? My husband thinks not (he had an N-ex)",

My fiance however brought it to the light that IS a huge deal and I shouldn't have to put up with that.\n\nThe thing is im so conflicted...my brother when he is not abusive is like a best friend to me. And as the older sister I have a lot of guilt over abandoning my baby brother. I don't know how to work through this. Also cutting out my brother will eventually mean cutting out my mother. I do not think she is an N, but she is an enabler. She babies my brother, see him at the problem child, that just needs the healing touch of a mothers love. THe last time I cutt him out, she got very defensive over him and  guilt tripped the crap out of me.\n\nIt caused all kinds of mental problems, I started having repeated panic attacks and symptoms of OCD.\nAlso I makes me feel so alone, thats the only family I have and I am a very big family oriented person. It makes me feel very depressed. \n\nDo you guys have any tips or advice on how to get through the emotions of cutting someone off? \n",

        "text": "There is a girl at my work who I believe is a narcissist. Some background: my mother is a narcissist, my brother is the golden child, and I am the scapegoat. I moved across the country to escape their abuse, and have been *much* better for it. I have been diagnosed with almost every mental illness, but nothing has really stuck yet. I know that I have issues with mental health, but the diagnosis has always been incorrect. \n\nI was diagnosed with bipolar when I was 20 years old. It turned out to be incorrect, but the diagnosis stuck with me for a few years. I also know many people with bipolar disorder and I find it to be one of the most difficult mental illnesses to treat. Fast forward to now, I am 27 and am studying to be a psychologist. I work at the front desk of a hotel while in school, and still seem to attract narcs despite thinking that I moved on. I was wrong.\n\nThere is a girl I work with who talks about herself.....constantly. I mean, I don't think she's ever asked me one question about myself. But she LOVES talking to me. She stays an hour or two after her shift to talk to me. It should really be called \"talking AT me\" because sometimes I don't even answer. I've tried everything...I've ignored her, I've tried to give her advice, I've just listened intently, and I've been outright RUDE trying to get her to understand I'm not interested in listening to her anymore. I get nothing out of this relationship, and once she's left I feel fucking exhausted. \n\nAnyway, yesterday she is talking at me and she's saying she thinks she needs a therapist. My eyes light up because I'm like YES, YOU DO, and I offered to give her some names of therapists who take our insurance in the area. Of course she declines (haha) but she goes on to talk about how she thinks she has manic depression. I just lost it at that point- I told her \"Wow, you probably shouldn't diagnose yourself with that. Do you know what manic depression is? Why do you think you have that?\" and she starts talking about how she sometimes feels really down but other times feels okay. \"That is a symptom of being human, not bipolar. You really shouldn't diagnose yourself with something like that.\" and I got really silent, she kept talking about herself and eventually went home, and I'm still stewing over it.\n\nWhen I went home to tell my boyfriend, he thought it was stupid but felt like I was taking it really personally. I guess I DID take it personally. I'm just so tired of hearing people flippantly diagnose themselves with mental illness when it is clear that they A, know nothing about mental illness, B, do NOT have a mental illness, and C, do not know that I have mental illness and never considered the fact that other people might get offended. I don't even HAVE this specific disorder and it rubbed me the wrong way. \n\nDo you guys encounter narcs that talk and talk and talk about themselves during \"life after narcissism?\" I feel like people who experience narcissistic abuse would definitely attract this type of person. I can't seem to find any real friends because the ones I attract are these types who just don't give a fuck about me, they simply just want to hear themselves talk! It's maddening!",

        "text": "Sorry I'm on my phone so I can't link ATM to my last post of the same title. But here's the update to it. \n\nI finally met with my higher up-we'll call her Miss. miss was very nice to me all during the team gathering before hand. Then afterwards she asked to speak to me privately-which was my request at the start of the function. She immediately starts to tear into me (raising her voice etc) about how it was my fault that I had received some leave without pay (LWOP) for my vacation/flex time she had approved. (It wasn't my fault). I told her it was just a miscommunication. I thought I was accruing PTO immediately to use (like it's been with other employments of mine) but for this company you had to wait until you got paid for that time period to have it available. She kept telling me that there were consequences for all parties involved and it was basically my fault and I needed to take responsibility for it. I tried to explain about it being a miscommunication and she wouldn't hear it. (Even my above supervisor was under the same impression, so if anyone should have caught the oversight, it was Miss who is above us both). So to end that thread of conversation I just said \"lesson learned. I know now, it won't happen again\". I didn't apologize or take responsibility. Then she wanted to know my work schedule. \n\nI'm supposed to meet a certain amount of hours over 2 weeks. How I do that depends on my work load and the demands of my clients. I was told in my interview that I had flexibility in my schedule as long as I met those requirements. If I worked over that amount, I had to take flex time. Well I work a full 8 HR day m-w and work through my lunch. I come in 2 hrs late on thursdays from my dr appointments, and that still leave an extra hour for me to take over the two weeks. She told me I'm not allowed to work through my lunches. I told her that's common place and I'm confused because of what she told me in the interview about flexible time (which she confirmed was correct) and why we are having this conversation. I told her that I am a hard worker, my supervisor is impressed with me, I'm always working &amp; helping coworkers. I even document what I do all day long and she was welcome to look at it. She made some off hand comment about how my direct supervisor (who is under miss) made a comment about how she was concerned how I used my flex time. I told her my exact schedule and invited her to look at my calendar. that diffused her. She said she was \"surprised\" that my schedule  was  so normal and straightforward. \n\nThen she asked how I'm liking the job and team and made small talk. then her affect shifted again and said that my direct supervisor had another concern that I didn't have good boundaries. I asked her what she meant and she said my supervisor said I was \"very talkative and disclosed things about myself very early.\"  I asked for an example of poor boundaries and she said \"I can't tell you that.\" (I.e she doesn't have any. I think she just said that because of a candid comment I made at the gathering about my brother. And I asked her directly if that was it and she said no, it was a candid gathering. Yeah. Right). So I again pushed her for examples and her concerns. She then lectured me on boundaries and getting to know people. I told her that I understood and that I would not and have not acted that way with our clients. As for with my team, if my supervisor said that, I'm a friendly open person who, due to moving a lot as a kid, knows how to make friends easily. So sometimes people are off put by my friendliness but once they know me, they know I'm just a friendly person. And it reassured her I wouldn't violate boundaries with the clients. That seemed to diffuse her again. She said I told her everything she wanted to hear. I asked her if it makes sense that someone like me who documents what they do during the day would be someone who has poor boundaries? That assuaged her too. At one point she kept telling me I didn't understand and I told her that I did and she wasn't understanding my question. \n\nThen the LWOP concern came up again and said there would be a consequence. I told her I would forward her my emails as my evidence. I swear to god if I get anything about this I'm appealing it. So she left and I was so proud of myself. No vomiting. No PTSD reflex. No diarrhea. Just a normal fight or flight response. I was angry and shaking but I stayed cool and professional. \n\nI spoke to my supervisor afterwards and she said she never said any of those things and miss always uses her as her scape goat (which is why she's quitting). She backed me up and will do so publicly she said. \n\nSo I sent my emails with my evidence. Printed them and CC'd my supervisor. Miss then sends a nasty gram back to me (printed) which I forward to my supervisor again. She then emails everyone on the teams she supervises saying we have to take our lunch break and we basically have to work a cookie cutter schedule-even though we don't have a cookie cutter job. It's contradictory to what I was told in my interview and how everyone operates. \n\nSo now everyone has gotten the shaft bc I called her out on her bs. I'm hoping my direct supervisor can get things back to normal before she leaves. And god knows if we can even trust the new chick coming in. That's a whole other story. \n\nAnyways TL; DR- I stood up for myself in a professional yet authentic way to my crazy boss (who def has something wrong with her mental health) and while I probably painted a target on my back, I didn't let my self get bulldozed. Moreover, I didn't get any PTSD trigger responses. Go me. I'm empowered. Now I'm drinking ",

        "text": "My mom divorced my Ndad (clinically diagnosed) about 14 years ago.  When I look at the family dynamics, I'm not sure we had a golden child but we definitely had a scapegoat, and that was me. Whenever things would go awry in their marriage or a personal issue would come up, I would suddenly need some new analysis, a medication shift, etc. A lot of my behavior stemmed from witnessing domestic abuse at home, and having a brother struggle with severe drug addiction, but neither of these facts were disclosed to professionals (and so I often was labelled as \"out of control\" or \"acting up for no reason whatsoever\").  \n\n It took a lot of unhealthy reactions to poorly prescribed medications, and a lot of time with me seeking out resources as a young adult, to break out of the system of \"nothing is wrong at home, everything is wrong with *you!*\".  It was finally hammered in when I went to Community College and snapped at my mom that \"all the reminders and constant 'help' didn't raise my GPA, so just leave me alone and let me do it myself!\".  It wasn't the most mature reaction, but I ended up going from a .8 in highschool to a 3.5\n\nAt this point in my life, I live about 2 hrs from home and am attending college.  My mom and I always had a contentious relationship at home; she's a catastrophizing nagger, and while she has good intentions, she's always clashed terribly with me.  I react very easily to things I sense around me; I'd grab skeletons out of the closet and throw them in the center of the room. I'd point out that it wasn't fair to criticize me so harshly when other kids acted the way I did. \n\nNow we have a more healthy relationship (the distance helps a ton), but family visits and the ability to text have kept this dynamic of nagging there.\n\nShe will say things like \"if you don't do (task) by ____ you could get killed! (car maintenance, etc)\".  I feel like she starts as a \"helpful reminder\", but nothing I say will end the nagging. If I say \"ok\" she goes into a long rant about *why* I need to do something. If I explain that I can't by ____ date (usually she chooses some date nearby and asks \"well make sure you do it by then, ok?\"), she does the same thing.  \n\nI feel like this is some sort of script and it's starting to bring up a lot of old, resentful feelings. I don't know if I can *stop* her, but how can I renegotiate this adult child/parent relationship? I don't want to constantly feel like she's pushing to back when I felt constantly monitored, and the reaction was \"if you did what I told you every time Is aid something, I wouldn't nag you!!!\"\n\nTl,dr: (E?)Mom and I have started to get to know each other as adults, but I feel like there are still lingering elements that are problematic. I want to have a healthy relationship, and be able to enforce boundaries/break scripts of weird family dynamics that still linger. How can I do this?",

But she's leaving mainly bc of our head supervisor who is micromanaging and contradictory. Today I had the pleasure of experiencing that which has triggered me massively. \n\nI have a friend coming to visit and need to either take time off that Monday morning she leaves or work from home. So I had to ask the head supervisor about it, along with my weekly therapy appointments. I usually have plenty of flex time because I don't take lunch and work 8 hour days each day. So I have to take 5 hours every 2 weeks. That's what everyone does. Which, even with my weekly therapy spot, leaves me with an extra hour on the pay period to flex. \n\nI get a response telling me that we need to discuss my work schedule l, use of PTO, LWOP (PTO I had to take and Lwop accidentally happened when I had to take some vacation time for vacation I had planned before I accepted the job and my supervisors didn't catch the error) and flex time. Until I meet with her, I cannot flex my schedule. This is completely opposite what I was told by her in my interview. She said that the hours are more or less 830-430 but I would earn flex time due to the inconsistent schedule with contacts and I would be in control of my own schedule. So I asked her when we could meet to discuss it and she has not responded. She has responded to other emails. So I know she has it. It's like she's trying to punish me by making me wait. I need to know ASAP because I have dr appoints scheduled. \n\nShe will be in our office tomorrow and I will discuss it with her. I just don't want to make myself her new target. And she's in charge until the new supervisor starts in October- and then we still have to see if we can trust her or not to run back and tell everything to the top supervisor. \n\nI am just envisioning the meeting of her gaslighting me and saying that she never said that or I'm mistaken. Or her even asking what my doctors appointments are for (it's EMDR therapy but I don't want to share that with her). So idk how to respond if that comes up. She's probably going to regulate my schedule and flex time. She may force me to sit at my desk and  eat lunch and not work. I'm tempted to get whatever she tells me to do in writing just to cover my ass. \n\nAny suggestions? In the mean time my anxiety is sky rocketed",

So much guilt about not being his emotional mistress or the martyr to a man like him.  I have been raised to feel like I owe myself to a man and not giving myself to one is a waste of myself.  But I'm getting somewhere.  Xoxox",

        "text": "Hey guys!\n\nCaught a major insight in therapy today, and had to tell you about it.\n\nI've recently (and probably abruptly) been shifting the focus from my NMom and I (a huge topic that would take years to properly sift through) to my wife and I (much smaller scale, and a better micro-environment for what my mom left in my head. Last week, I told him about the fighting we'd been doing, and the dead bedroom we have , and how the fights always seem to end with my wife pleading for me to \"grow up\", or surrender to something she wants, which I refuse to do (the NMom's goal in any confrontation was \"surrender to what I want, or I'll make you wish you had\", and I've grown allergic to that). I told the therapist about the behaviors NMom trained into me-- that worked like a charm within my dynamic with her, but terribly within my wife's dynamic with me-- and he said at it wasn't' surrender she wanted from me; it was vulnerability...which, thanks to NMom-- for whom Simon &amp; Garfunkel's \"I Am A Rock\" was practically an anthem-- I'm more afraid of than anything else.\n\n(Logical leap here...follow me.) in thinking about why I'm so addicted to emotional invulnerability like my mom was, i remembered something Dr. Brenė Brown said in her TED talk: \"people who grew up with a strong sense of belonging and connection to others become people who feel worthy of belonging and connection to others.\" I realized I've spent my entire marriage doing whatever manipulation, lying, hiding it took to make my wife think I'm worthy of her time...and most of my life believing I'm not enough as just me to be interesting to other people (my mom was a regional celebrity and professional singularity...she died with at least 8 career \"firsts\", and I always felt like a star behind the sun...burning on my own, but no one saw me except as something that brightened her)\n\nIt's likely one toe toward a foot in the door, and I'm not quite sure which way to move with this knowledge-- to this day, I feel more secure in public if I'm in a role (announcer, team member, etc.) than alone and unadorned-- but I wanted to share that breakthrough with you guys to see if anyone else had noticed that in their own post-Nparent life.

        "text": "NOTE:  this is NOT a post about politics; it is a post requesting advice on how to cope with overhearing people say hateful, contemptuous things about someone else, which in this case is a political candidate.  I will NOT be engaging these people in political discussions, and since I am lower-ranking than all of my coworkers who are making these hateful remarks (I’m a temp employee, they are all permanent employees), I have limited ability in preventing their remarks.  \n\nI got massively triggered at work today, hearing two coworkers talk in a hateful, contemptuous manner about Hillary Clinton.  They were in adjacent cubicles to mine, and one of the people is my supervisor.  I went from being reasonably calm, and focused on my work, to blood-boiling angry in a matter of seconds.  I immediately left my cubicle and went for a 20 minute walk outside, but the walk only took a little of the edge off my anger.  When I came back in, my supervisor had to discuss something with me, and he noticed I was angry.  I managed to tell him (without screaming or dropping F-bombs) that I did not want to hear political talk at work.  I was cold, stiff, not my most articulate self, and I couldn't even look at him, but he got the point, and agreed (and this is the SECOND time we have had this discussion in the last few months).  \n\nI didn’t even realize I had been triggered until the anger finally drained away and I was so utterly exhausted afterwards.  I had to go home for lunch and just stayed home (and told my supervisor I wasn’t feeling well and needed to stay home and rest for the rest of the afternoon, which I did).  \n\nI really don’t know how to cope with this.  I avoid discussing as much political news at work as possible because I don’t want to hear the hatefulness.  And, for clarity, I’m not emotionally attached to Clinton, it’s that if I hear this sort of hateful talk about ANYONE, I get triggered.  Most people, however, don’t talk this way at work about any other person; but because it’s politics, and virtually all of my coworkers are conservative white males, it’s just inevitable, apparently.  \n\nIt is simply not reasonable for me to expect to be able to avoid overhearing hateful political talk.  So my request is, how do I cope with this?  What mental hoops do I try to make myself jump through to not get triggered?  I am aware of Pete Walker’s flashback management techniques, but I was just wondering if anyone had some more specific advice on how they handle overhearing horrible things that they can’t do anything about.  Thank you!\n",

        "text": "Hi everybody. First post here, though I've posed at RBN before. Backstory: My Nmom n/Edad, GC Bro, FM cousin, and the rest of my FOO threw me (age 48F) away because I wouldn't give the bunch of them carte blanche to abuse and marginalize my special needs daughter. We're not worthy or welcome of \"being in their nice family\". Then a few weeks ago Nmom wanted a \"1-word answer\" if I was done with them, and I confirmed that their own demands made it impossible to come back.  \n\nThey basically burned the bridge down. Other times in life when we've had periods of NC or reduced contact, or VLC, I've found some way to reach across the separation, to rebuild something for us to have some kind of relationship.  I've kind of surprised myself this time -  I'm not busy scampering around over here trying to throw a rope across the chasm, build some little footbridge, find some way to reconnect... In fact, it's almost like for a few months, I was left in a sobbing heap, looking out at this great abyss... and then, slowly, the sun started coming up. And I could see colors. And I could see that abyss wasn't black, it wasn't empty, it wasn't nothingness.... it was like realizing it had just been too dark inside my hurt and heart to see that \"abyss\" for what it was - my own personal Grand Canyon. It can't be \"bridged\". It shouldn't be built over. Or filled in. Or not exist. There's beauty in this massive expanse between us. There are colors and living things and good things, that can't live unless that space is open for them.\n\nSo, after seeing the beauty of it, after months processing all of this, I took a little more time to sit in peace. To just be one with my Grand Canyon. And that's when my mother chose to break her \"punishing\" silence, to contact me for the first time in months. And while it came out of the blue, ... I spoke my truth. I spoke my truth because I KNEW my truth. \n\nI was able to bless them, all of them, for burning down the bridges that connected us. I will hold them in the Light and pray for them. But I also bless this Grand Canyon, this open space between us, this holy ground. I will hold it sacred. It keeps me safe.\n\nIt didn't take me long, after that contact, to rebound from it. I regained my inner peace in a matter of days. I've been much, much more fortunate than many, in that I'm NC and they haven't been stalking and harassing me with calls and texts and the like. I already had them blocked on Facebook, and I really don't do any other social media anyway.\n\nI find myself looking forward to the next few months. Genuine happiness. I've always loved Autumn, but there was a point where I was worrying about Thanksgiving, and Christmas, and my birthday, and my kid's birthday and just... all the stuff the busy months where previously the norm for me and my little family was a ton of big, extended family gatherings. I love my cousins, I'd really like to see them, but the last family party we went to, my mother proved she couldn't be anything but taunting and toxic. So, after considering it, I talk with my daughter and husband, we we brainstormed a list of things that are OUR favorite parts of the holidays, or things we have wanted to do but were too over-committed.\n\nIt's amazing. \n\nAnd yesterday, I finally stopped procrastinating a call I'd been putting off for weeks. I'd been afraid to even *ask* for something. It made no sense, it wouldn't to anyone but other ACONs, but there's ONE thing I especially wanted to be able to do with my little family this December because it's one of my favorite things. To my delight, I've discovered, it's totally within our reach. I don't know why I was so worried. I guess it's just because it was a small, meaningful thing,  for myself, so the specter of THEM loomed over it in my own head. It's completely within character for my Nmom to be petty enough to ruin something like this for me, just for spite. It would be the kind of thing that she'd know I especially wanted and anticipated, and she'd dangle it over me for weeks in advance only to snatch it away and give it to her GC at the last minute, and then belittle me for having hurt feelings \"you're too sensitive\" ... and also laugh in delight at my hurt. And if I complained, she'd get her E's and FM's to gang up on me at the same time.\n\nI don't have to be her plaything at Christmas anymore. It's sinking in now, I'm almost breathless, I can't imagine how I'll feel come Christmas day... drunk without a drop of eggnog, probably.\n\nIs that \"shaking off FLEAS\" - when you realize you're int he middle of a head trip they installed, and you just stop it and break the cycle? Do the scary thing you think you're unworthy of success for? Break out of the paralysis and just be brave?\n\nI like this new land, on my side of the grand canyon. What else will I get to discover here, I wonder?\n\n*O, wonder!\nHow many goodly creatures are there here!\nHow beauteous mankind is! O brave new world,\nThat has such people in't!*\n~ Shakespeare, The Tempest (V, i)\n",

        "text": "Hi friends -\n\nI have had a tumultuous relationship with Ndad and Nstepmom since I was five years old. My relationship with them has left me consistently disappointed, sad, and, at times, very angry. \n\nThe breaking point for me was when my Ndad announced that he would not be attending my wedding. After 25+ years of him not showing up to things just because my mother would be in attendance, I'm just tired. That's his choice, and I cannot bring myself to beg him to come to his only daughters wedding. \n\nI feel like I have this huge void because of my father's attitude towards me. I graduated college and am now running my own business, but still feel a huge loss. I still want to call him and tell him things that I think will impress him. I still wish my dad could tell me that he was proud of me, or that he's sorry for all the pain that he's caused. I know he's incapable, but it breaks my heart to think my children won't know their grandfather because I just can't take any more disappointment. \n\nAs much as I think to myself \"It is what it is,\" how do you really start to feel like it's not this insurmountable emotional roadblock? I hate calling myself a victim, but that's sometimes what I feel like. How have people really been able to move on and not feel like the emotional void is holding them back from real happiness?

        "text": "Background: I am a SoNF who chose NC/VLC at about age 16. My NF is a raging functional alcoholic and has been since he was about 15. I lived with him until I was about 16.\n\nMy NF and his e-girlfriend often got into altercations, both verbal and physical, while I was living at his house. There were two other children in my house as well, my nonverbal autistic sister who is a little more than 3 years younger than me, and e-gf's son, who was about seven at the time.\n\nJust before this incident, I had invited a friend of mine over to do teenager things, and he left a lever action 4.5\" switchblade in my room. I asked if he wanted me to bring it back to him and he told me to keep it for emergencies. \n\nFlash forward later into the summer, a week before my sophomore year of high school. I was 15.\n\nI woke up in a haze at about midnight one night. All I could hear was screaming. NF was notorious for staying out late at bars and not answering calls. Frequent drunk driver. Almost always shitfaced. He was screaming at his girlfriend and I could her her body hit the wall. The other children were, of course, in the house.\n\nEarly in my life, probably around age 11 or 12, I developed a different kind of maturity that I'm sure many of you are familiar with. I was already an adult before I was a teenager.\n\nSo, when I heard that, I walked out into the living room and started telling them to act their age, especially with the younger kids in the house. I often did this when they got into altercations, even though it was 100% of the time never in my benefit to do so. Thanks, Hypervigilance.\n\nA yelled at my dad for being childish and having a habit that was destroying our family. He yelled back some incoherent bullshit and I just went back to my room and locked the door.\n\nI could hear him making his way to my room, so I grabbed the switchblade and held it in fear of my life. Mind you I had never even been in a fight with someone my own age, let alone any fight involving weapons. I had no idea what was going to happen.\n\nMy dad kicked down my door and continued screaming. I was screaming back at him. This specific part is fuzzy in my head, and I'm pretty sure I blacked out or something. We were getting in each other's faces, and I think he pushed me and I punched him in the face. The next thing I remember, I was pinned on my bed with my dad pressing his thumbs into my larynx. I couldn't find the lever on the switchblade and I thought I was going to die. But, I found it, and managed to stab him in his forearm, forcing him to let go of my neck. We fought a little bit more, his girlfriend screaming in my doorway for us to stop the entire duration. \n\nShe eventually got him off of me and he pushed me out of the front door since I was running in that direction anyway. I walked to a friends house with no shoes or pants at around 1am.\n\nI stayed with my paternal grandmother for a week after that. I dealt with calls and questions from all my family members asking if I was on hard drugs and what had happened. Apparently my dad and his girlfriend were trying to make it look like I stabbed him out of nowhere, for no reason. I told everyone the truth about what happened, and luckily most of them believed me over my dad.\n\nI have my dad blocked on all forms of social media and iOS messaging, however sometimes he will relay messages through my godmother in an attempt to contact me. Every single time, he says he doesn't know why I am so hostile towards him. When my godmother brings up the fact that he has never apologized for anything that he did to me, he says he doesn't know what to apologize for other than being an alcoholic in general, which is pathetic. Sometimes he'll bring up this incident in his own defense, saying that I've never apologized for stabbing him. Which is true, but I'm not going to apologize for self defense, especially when he denies choking me.\n\nI used to have a lot of self doubt about that night, wondering if I was really in the wrong or acting crazy. The only thing that kept me from believing that was that *I remember.* I really do. I thought my life was going to end that night, I thought he was going to crush my larynx, I thought I wasn't going to find the switchblade lever. And it doesn't matter that he doesn't believe any of that.\n\nSorry if some of this is hard to follow, it was really difficult to write. If anyone is interested in any clarifications or anything feel free to let me know. This is my first actual post.",

After all the manipulation and gaslighting and finally him leaving me after more than a month of silent treatment (and ocasional affection and talking about babies and our future when he was in a good mood, only to come back home at 4 in the morning every night...), I felt so empty and Alone that I tried to kill myself (almost did). Then I started looking into narcissism, found this threat and others around the subject and it saved my life - I finally accepted I grew up with a Nmom (made me study ballet and piano until I was eighteen and always kept me apart from the rest of the family) and that I always choose partners like her.\n\nSo my Nex left and took the dog, and my grandpa is in the hospital (which Nex tried guilt-tripping me like it was my fault) and Nmom has been spending all her time there. I told her she should bring her dog so she wouldn't have to worry about it for a while. Nex didnt buy anything for the house in the past few months, only clothes for himself, and I think he didnt give the dog the meds for fleas (not sure how to call it in English). Told mom to do it before bringing the dog, she said she did already. Now her dog is full of feas, I don't think she gave him the meds as well! What's up with this people?\n\nAnyway, tonight my mom is picking up the dog, since I'm moving in with my sister, husband and two children, another city 3 hours away. Nmom has been saying on the phone how this is a bad idea, that I have a nice job here, why don't I stay with her for a while, etc. I've been ignoring it and I just keep asking about grandpa until she gets tired and gives up on bothering me (she started this lectures again when Nex left the house and I was in tears and begging her to stop and let me rest), but I haven't seen her personally. How do I go about this tonight? Since I'm leaving, she will again start saying my life is shit, I was so talented and gave it up (I work in customer service, never went back to the stage as soon as I finished school)... How do I keep calm and not let her get in my head? I really have to move away so I don't end back with Nex (I still stupidly love him and want to \"save\" him) but I'm afraid I'll still listen to her. Any advice is very welcome.

        "text": "I'm a 41/f married with my own healthy family. But I am only now fighting my way out of an N web of my FOO... (I think I am down with the lingo??) \n\nShort background : Dad- rager, alcoholic. Can remember alcohol fueled explosions that resulted in him getting physical with me. Earliest memory was when I was a little girl and I wouldn't let him dry my hair and he pulled me down the stairs by my hair. My Emom was right there. I don't remember her doing anything but looking frightened. Several other episodes like that throughout young life. And the home was in a constant state of rage. Anything could set him off. And Emom would gently take me to her office until he calmed down. \n\nBut fast forward to adulthood. I was enmeshed, period. Anyone else? Stuck in the child state. Felt terror and obligation. Until - we were all (my hubs and 4 kids) at their house after he raged at my mom (in front of my kids) because she had turned the ceiling fan on not thinking about the helium balloons he had gotten for my kids. Got all wrapped up- (she was hot from cooking an amazing meal). When he lit into her- I had had enough. I went to him and said \"don't you ever talk to my mother like that again.\" He had this nano second look of boyish shock. That turned to rage- against me. When we argued for a second I said finally, that's it we are leaving. I grabbed the hubs (who hated them anyway) and my sweet babies and piled in car. He chased us out the door yelling at us not to go. \"That's enough of this. Get back in here!\" I did not relent. \n\nDrove away only to get desperate texts from mom that Dad was so upset, please talk to him... Etc. he then went into his bedroom, locked the door, and sat there with a loaded gun. All of this relayed to me by my desperate mom. I remember calling my brother (8 years older and further along in his break from them) and I said \"they are your problem now.\" Eventually he came out and was okay. But wrote me emails demanding an apology. It went on for months until (after MY insistence), he made a half ass apology to me\n\nAnyway- this kind of crap went on- not as bad but still...\n\nMy behavior and thinking was deeply affected. I have projected these things on me very Non-n husband, been unfaithful in a disgusting manner meant only to humiliate me and confirm that I am the piece of shit that I feel like (rejecting and sabotaging the beauty my husband offers me). The other guy was a lot like my dad in personality and look- and treated me like a true piece of shit.\n\nI continue to be stuck in a parent child dynamic with my husband despite his yearning for an adult relationship. We are working on that- we are in therapy, I am in therapy, medication, etc. His love and perseverance is beyond holy and amazing. \n\nWhen I told my parents what I had done to my family, my father responded \"Don't beat yourself up, Bill Clinton did it- lots of people did it.. It wasn't that they cheated, it's how and that they got caught.\" \nMy father cheated on my mom, he didn't know I knew. Shocker.\n\nAnyway, I have since set hard boundaries with very little contact. And they have been relentless. Finding anyway to move past those boundaries. Writing surfacey nice, but truly shitty letters to my husband who they think is really the cause of my distress and boundaries.\n\nWhew. Way too long. There's so much more in so many directions. \n\nHow is this anything BUT narcissism?\n\nDo I belong here?",

I'll be eaten alive, and I'll be stuck in another state. I wouldn't have any control of when I get to the airport, because I have no money. I may just stay at my apartment, but I will be beyond depressed and lonely because my boyfriend will be away, and so will everyone else. I already know how I am when everyone I love is away from me. It's not neediness, it's sadness and despair and guilt. \n\nI'm not a mooch and I don't want to come off as one. I just feel so bad if I were to go to his family's house again.

I can bring board games and coloring books for fun! \n\nI'd love to meet up with any of you! On any phase of your healing! All ages, genders, whatever!

        "text": "Sorry for the long read!\n\nSo back when I was a teen I had no idea that my mother was a Narc. I was both the scapegoat and the goldenchild (yeyy only child!) so I was gaslit into worshipping my Nmother. We were creepily and unhealthily close. For instance, when I went to college, I returned home every weekend, despite a one way, 5 hour drive.\n\nMy friends would tease me, about how much my mother must love and need me, feeding into the illusion that I was my mother's whole world. (In hindsight, I was being used for the child support money and Narc supply.)\n\nOnce my therapist helped me realize my mother was a Narc, I began to realize I had surrounded myself with toxic people. In my tight-knit group, I believe one had BPD and one was a Narc. (Not diagnosed) \n\nBecoming aware of unhealthy behavior, I realized how terrible my friends actually treated me. I was a whipping post, someone that never argued, and many friends took advantage of me financially. My Nmother had trained me that this was normal. \n\nFor the friends that were extremely hurtful and toxic, I went NC, which was conveniently around the time that I moved across country. The other friends did not approve or accept my decision to go NC, and actually lectured me that I was overreacting and being petty and selfish.\n\nSo, to the issue. It has been several years since then. None of my friends, toxic or not, have any idea I have been NC with my family for 5 years. I am healthier, happier, and more assertive than I have ever been. I'm not the meek, passive, scared-of-everything person anymore.\n\nOne of the friends whom disapproved strongly of my NC choices is visiting the city I am in and wants to visit with me. While I never went NC, I haven't spoken to her in 3 or 4 years. \n\nMy husband thinks I should just cut my losses and go NC with her as well; as he believes her visit is merely to continue scolding me for my 'temper tantrum'. This might be true, but I've had to go NC with so many people that I hate to add another. It makes me feel crazy and that I'm overreacting. That being said, remembering her reaction to me going NC with a friend, I can't imagine the judgement I would receive for going NC with my Nmother.\n\nHas anyone been in this boat before? How did you handle it? Is it really best just to go NC?\n",

We have an interview tonight that has been reschedule twice now and I'm terrified it won't work out because a she's 9 weeks pregnant and my house smells like dog pee despite our best attempts to clean and deodorize. We can't quite afford to replace it yet-hopefully within 6months to a year. If she doesn't work out, then I don't know what to do. I'm out of options and time. And on top of that I've been awake since 445 am this morning when my husband woke me up to settle the baby. \n\nSo as you can see I'm in a rotten mood. I feel depressed. I have no energy, none of my typical joie de vivre, and no motivation. I haven't been able to eat (&amp; that may be due to the antibiotic for my tooth in part). I have a mandatory fun activity for work today that is my personal hell. \n\nSo please leave me some happy thoughts, pictures of chubby babies and/or puppies, funny memes, and/or good vibes. TIA",

I've done everything the dentist has told me to-including the antibiotics that has given me diarrhea. I went into today and found out I need a root canal and crown. It's my worst nightmare between my HORRIBLE dentist anxiety and sensory processing disorder that's massively triggered by the drill. Oh and did I mention it costs almost $900 that I don't fucking have? I have my appointment Thursday. And she gave me pain meds but I can't get them until tomorrow because I have $6 to my name until pay day. Thankfully the Motrin and Tylenol seem to be helping for now. \n\nAlso do the the energy zapping, constant pain- I bungled my first-on-my-own client today. I got the times mixed up for her appointment and was an hour late. Not the end of the world, but one more fucking thing. I actually had real work to do today (it's new job and I'm just now getting clients and I have no idea what I'm doing) and my brain was too fried to function. \n\nThen around lunch, I get a text from my new nanny (today was her first day after the crazy shit storm of last week with the other sitter I posted about). She said she thinks she's allergic to my dogs. She's going to the doctor today to see what they say. She would not look me in the eye this afternoon when she talked to me and her affect seemed different than this morning and when we interviewed her. Idk if it was just not feeling well or if she had already decided to not come back. I can't handle another sitter. The trust to leave my kids with someone is so hard especially after last week. I've been an anxious wreck all day. And I don't know if my son can handle another sitter. He was getting weepy again this morning thinking he had to go back to that awful place from last week. He really seemed to enjoy his day with the new lady. I'm just so sick to my stomach with it all. It's making me question all my judgment abilities as a parent. \n\nAnd to top it all off, I busted my bumper of my car at the dentist and my husband had to duct tap it back on after it drug on the road all the way home. \n\nI just want to vomit, cry and stare at a wall right now. \n\nUPDATE: turns out the new nanny is deathly allergic to dogs and can't come back. So I have no day care for my kids tomorrow and can't take off work. Fml",

After going NC in some way they struggled with knowing themselves or who they are, even things like what their favorite color is due to years of having things mandated upon them. I went through lots of that, where anything I liked was \"wrong\" and the Nm's opinions would be thrust upon me and mine and the \"right\" things to like. I had a few years in my life where I had VLC and was able to sort of be outside the constant influence of the Nm. But for even much of my adult life everything got the unsolicited scrutiny of the NM and her flying monkeys. \n\nWhen I hit 50 I took a friends advice to stop caring about what others think and go find myself. It was more of a mantra that you are old enough to not care and just do what makes you happy. This hit around the same time I had been finishing going 100% NC. So I found myself at a loss for who I was, even what things I liked. \n\nI started doing Pinterest boards of things I knew I somewhat liked already. Dealing with things in my past brought up horrible memories but also things that I liked, places that were my refuge from the garbage at home, things that spoke to me even if my mother told me I couldn't like them. As I started saving a few things I would find more things. Sometimes \"oh that is pretty\" is enough, make it yours. Something looks intriguing? Now you have an interest. \n\nI started remembering people I admired in some way when I was a child, even if it wasn't someone I had lots of contact with. The memory that an adult had something admirable be it kindness, poise, loved life, helped people learn, broke barriers, whatever. I mentally filed those into this sort of surrogate for what was broken growing up. \n\nThis has all really helped feel less like I am just lost and more like a whole person minus the Nm's damage, or at least as minus as I can be on a given day. \n",

I'll be at a coffee shop and see a mug I know he'd like (he blows through $30 tumblers like they cost nothing. Trashes them, loses lids, etc), and I'll have to stop myself from buying it and physically mailing it to him (he's very far away). It's been persistent, every time I go out. His favorite beer at the grocery store, things like that. My family (no ndad of course, but bpd/emom, gcbro, eSIL (who I actually like) and 4 month old niece) invited themselves to fly out for my baby's first birthday in a couple weeks. Randomly I'll think 'oh! I should get hubs and gcbro reservations and pay for them to go that restaurant I've been dying to go to.. I know eSIL is worried about money and wouldn't want gc splurging like that\". Then I'll have to stop myself again and tell myself, \"No. If anything I should get reservations for hubs and -I- for our anniversary. We can't even afford that restaurant beyond maybe once a year. Gc inviting himself into town isn't a special occasion wtf is wrong with me, I don't even want them coming..\". And Gc would literally never, ever do something like what I've been thinking about for me. He's never even sent me a kind text without asking for something. Why do I feel this need to cater to him, spend extravagantly without any reason? How do I make these thoughts stop?\n\nLast night I had a nightmare about the business gc and I own. Ndad physically shows up and is stealing my portion (something he'd always helped himself to until I figured out how to stop it), all the employees are infatuated with ndad and rally around him. Everyone immediately starts invalidating me \"calm down, it's no big deal, dude your sister's freaking out\" type comments. Things I've heard my whole life. The dream continued with more of taking ndads side over some abuse I suffered at his hands.\n\n When I wake up I  try to flip the script on it but I don't know which way to go with it. I'd never even be in that kind of situation any more, nor do I ever want to be in a place where I'm vying for the approval of others. I want to not give a shit about what anyone thinks or says, I know what happened growing up, I know ndad and gc are wrong and I want that to be enough for me. \n\nSo what the hell is going on with me? Anyone else struggle with how they treat the gc? I feel like I'm taking one step forward and two steps back.",

I have been professional through this whole thing. She sends me texts today about my 3yro hitting and pushing her son. I apologize and tell her we have been working on nice hands because he an get physical and rough when he plays or has big emotions. He's three. Thats what 3 yro boys do. We are working on it. He isn't malicious or mean though. He just is learning to deal with his anger. He apologized on his own to the kid too after his time out.\n\nI then sent her a text later saying that I was going to try and find someone to take over Tuesday instead of Wednesday since he was having such an abnormally hard time. He doesn't ever act like this and it would make things easier on everyone. I also asked for our refund for Tuesday. I was accommodating and professional. She then sends me this nasty text about how mean and malicious my kid is, how she won't stand for it, and insinuates that we are bad parents. She says she wished we had been up front about his social skills and about how violent he is. WTF??? My kid has a heart of gold, he is empathetic and sweet. He's a social butterfly and his own person. He isn't violent by any means! Yea, he can be an asshole some times because HE IS THREE. It was extremely unprofessional. And all because, god forbid, my child is having a rough week and isn't dealing well because he is THREE FUCKING YEARS OLD. And she is just mad because he didn't fit into her perfect picture expectations or god forbid had a different personality and needs to her son. I just told her that I was on my way to get them and it obviously wasn't a good fit since he typically doesn't behave that way. I took the high road.\n\nWhen I got there, she wouldn't look me in the eye and her husband was out getting cash for my refund. I got the kids in the car and waited. When he got there, he handed me the money and dared to say \"I'm sorry this didn't work out.\" I responded \"I didn't appreciate your wife's text insinuating that we are bad parents. That was uncalled for\" He said \"Well I read it and it was from the heart..\" and I  interrupted and said \"and I'm sure you believe it but it doesn't give you the right to pass judgment. You don't know us. He doesn't typically behave this way. He is having a hard time\" He said \"Well it's because he watches too much tv.\" I said \"No. You do not have the right to say that.\" He said \"I do because it's effecting our family.\" I said \"and thats why we are ending this relationship. You don't ever get to make a judgment about another parent or kid. You don't know us. I recommend in the future you and your wife have some professionalism.\" I got in the car and slammed my door shut as he was saying \"I recommend that you...\" didn't hear the rest.\n\nI. AM. FUMING. I realize none of this is on me. Yea, my kid has energy and can be a handful because he has a personality and tenacity. He is not evil, mean, or malicious. He's THREE FUCKING YEARS OLD. I'm not a parent who has delusions about their children. i know my kids will do wrong and it's my job to teach them to learn from it and be better. He didn't fit in to this fucked up expectation she had and it was on her for not being flexible or understanding. The effect it was having on her family was because of their inabilities not because of my child. Plus, she had already started the process to end babysitting for us, so why did she feel the need to send me such a nasty text? She had two days left-if that. I was working on making today the last anyways. Speaks to her stupidity, immaturity, and craziness.\n\nI am just so glad that I am home now and they are safe. She is blocked on everything. I hopefully never have to deal with them again.\n",

        "text": "First post. Hi... Finding this subreddit is a godsend after deciding to go no contact with my ignoring adoptive family of origin and low contact with my engulfing birth mother three weeks ago.    \n\nI'm in my 3rd trimester of pregnancy. Yes, I mourned on my basement floor at 2 am surrounded by empty, crappy cards that were sent in the last year. But I'm not sad right now.\nI'm livid and I don't know what to do. \n\nBreaking up with my Nfamily is like breaking up with a romantic partner that I've known my whole life. Everything reminds me of them or some situation. My mind is constantly racing and I can't stop talking about it with my boyfriend. I was at the doctor's office and a woman's arms on a game show, that looked nothing like my Nmom's arms, triggered thoughts of her arms...then thoughts of her, abuse, enter spiral. What the hell? This happens all day with constant new thoughts creeping up. I'll haven't been able to sleep because I am so angry at the stuff I accepted that I thought was normal. \n\nAnyone else feel like even after going no contact, your N has still robbed you of your life? I'm excited to start over with my new family, and I really have no desire to talk to them, be accepted by them or have my future child around them, but I can't enjoy these last few days of my pregnancy because I can't shut my brain off. \n\nSome very light, recent context: \n\n[My phone has been broken since before I went NC. After learning from my FM aunt that kept telling me to call my nparents (when all I asked for was a recipe) that my Nbrother allegedly tried to call me and left a message on that number when his son was born, I decided to check my voicemail from another phone. Nothing! Just messages from doctors offices and an overdue notice on a library audio book. In three weeks. I told my FM aunt that he never left a voicemail and neither did my nparents. Almost immediately, I got a Facebook message from my Nbrother's wife saying something like \"Didn't you get a call from (Nbrother)? He said he left you a message! Hehe!\" I said that he didn't. I asked if she was sure he said he left a voicemail. She said he \"thinks\" he did and asked if I got a new number. I told her I didn't have a new number when the baby was born and told her I thought it was odd that he was telling family members that he called me when he didn't. I unfriended her. Again. [I had stupidly re-friended her to find out if my nephew was born yet because no one told me]. \nSo yeah, I'm angry that my FM aunt told me to call my Nparents when they haven't contacted their pregnant SG daughter (me) in the last month of my pregnancy, and then my NBrother had the nerve to lie to my family about informing me of the birth of his son. \n\n\nMy Nfamily has always excluded me from life events since I ran away from home, even though we have maintained contact. Their extended family thinks I don't give a shit about them. I wasn't invited to my sisters college graduation this summer because my dad told my mom he was worried I'd make it about me (because I'm pregnant? My Nbrother and his wife went with them and she was also pregnant at the time).\n\nSo, everyone thinks I just chose not to go. \nI went to a Christmas party in 2014 and all of my extended family kept running up to me and telling me how nice it was that I decided to join them. \nIt was the first holiday I was invited to since 2010.\nNparents have lied about annual camping trips being canceled, then I would see pictures on FB.\n\nOn FB, my mom has only pictures of my sister. She has one album with me in it, titled \"children\". It's three pictures of my senior photo, the captions read \"Daughter My Name\". She had another picture of me performing at a music festival and the caption read \"it was windy that day.\" I won an award. No mention.   \n\nWhen my mom found out I was pregnant, she said, \"Are you sure you want to have a baby? It's not a dog, you can't just put it outside when it won't stop crying.\" \n\nWhen my bf (father of my child) moved in with me last year after driving across the country, I asked if we could have some food. He was here for a week. She said she'd make me a sandwich, but not him because he didn't have a job and she didn't approve of him moving in with me. The same guy took me off the street three years ago when she knew I was eating out of garbage cans and Ndad said \"You know, life's really tough right now, (my name). We're going on a cruise next month and money is really tight.\" We now own a house and have a baby on the way.]\n\nSee, obsessive, rambling thoughts. I'm sorry. Please, please, tell me what strategies you use to keep your mind off of this toxic mind occupation!\nHaven't they ruined our lives long enough?\n\nEdited to add: \nIt's also very hard not to try to justify myself to the FM. Should I tell her my decision to go NC? \nMy boyfriend warns against it, since we need my Nparent's insurance for the birth of our son in a few weeks and so he doesn't think we should stir the pot or announce anything.",

But she played the victim and I was whole heartedly convinced that I was the bad guy. That I was ruining every ones lives around me including my 3 month old child. I can't believe how naive I was. I can't believe I survived this. I can't believe I thought she loved me back. She tried to convince me that I needed to get my uterus taken out. That my husband (her little brother) was cheating on me. That nobody loved me but her. That my dad must have molested me when I was young  (he didn't). That I should end any other relationships that weren't her. That I should go to work her job (i did it for her) as a church janitor because I somehow owed her even though we were buying 600$ worth of groceries for her family each month. I almost let this person destroy me. WHAT the fuck is wrong with me? Like how the hell did I let all that happen and for so long. How did I believe her.

How the hell am I going to be able to make normal healthy decisions. I really need some guidance from people who have gone through this stuff and created a happy life. Please help. ",

        "text": "I think I did the right thing, but I'm no so sure.\n\nI recently moved into a new place. It's a house in which all the rooms are rented individually. I have the most private room in the house, with a lot of storage.\n\nOn of my roommates has her lease ending at the end of August. This has been the plan for at least a month, and I had casually asked her about where she was moving to, etc., so I know that she's had plenty of time to prepare.\n\nOn Sunday (roughly 3-4 days before moving out), she knocked on my door. She told me that her flight didn't leave until Sep 5th, and asked if she could sleep in my storage space. Even at this point, it seemed a little ridiculous, but I felt bad and said yes. But, then she kept asking for more, and it was clear that she was just basically going to continue living there as normal, just sleeping in my area instead of hers. She even wanted me to make of copy of my keys for her!\n\nI was really uncomfortable but mostly just wanted her to leave me alone and just sort of agreed to it. But I could barely sleep because I knew this could have some serious negative consequences. The house is not a very private place, and it's going to be super obvious if she's still living here after her lease is up. The landlord is around often enough, especially around lease changes, that there's a decent chance he'll run into her in the 5-6 days between her lease ending and her flight. There are quite a few parts of the house that are shared and at least 5 other people in this house that know who she is, and would find it weird that she's still here.\n\nI talked to her the next day and told her that I looked at my lease and realized that making her a set of keys would violate my lease agreement. So, I told her it was okay if she stayed with me, but that she needed to ask the landlord for permission to keep her keys. I even offered to return her keys for her because I felt so guilty.\n\nWhat amazed me, was that she still wanted me to do all the work. She asked me to ask him for her, which I didn't think was a good idea, but she insisted. It was night already, and I told her I'd do it in the morning because I didn't want to disturb him, but she insisted \"he's awake\". I still waited until morning, but she still asked me twice that evening after then if he responded yet. I did text him in the morning, but he didn't respond to me. When she asked me again if he had responded, I told him no, and then she asked me to call him. I was *very* annoyed at this point, I work nights and sleep during the day (which is something she knows) so it was already an inconvenience, so I just told her that it would be better if she called him.\n\nWell, she did call him, and I guess he was pretty upset that she was trying to do this. (Predictably...) I suggested she try AirBnB, which she didn't want to do because she \"[doesn't] want to sleep in a bed in someone's house.\" At this point I pretty much gave up on her, and have been avoiding her since. (I'm actually skipping making breakfast at home just to avoid her because I just cannot deal with this.)\n\nAnyway, I'm feeling enormously guilty and just feel like I need some support. Maybe you think I'm a jerk, but, on some intellectual level, I know that what I did was more than I ever even needed to do. But I still feel enormously guilty. I have pretty much zero confidence that she could live here in secret for almost a week, and I am not comfortable making her copies of my keys for a non-emergency situation.\n\nI mean, good lord, how would you feel if you moved into a new place and still saw the old tenant living there? I know she met the girl who is taking her spot. I'd find that a little creepy. I also sort of get the impression that she's having a hard time getting rid of her stuff (she's been trying to pass on and/or sell me her things for the past month), so I'm guessing that if she stayed that a lot of her stuff would still be here even after the end of her lease, especially in the kitchen and bathroom.\n\nAs I an asshole for not making her keys? If it hadn't been for that, I may not have been that worried, afterall, I can have guests if I want and I did recently (maybe that's why she asked me), but I never made an extra set of keys and I told the other people in the house that I was going to be having a guest, and for how long she was staying. Making keys for a previous tenant so she can continue living there as normal just seems like a huge line to cross, am I right?\n\nEdit: I realized that I never clarified that no, she didn't move in with me. Once she knew she couldn't have keys she decided not to. Or, maybe the landlord yelling at her made her decided not to. I don't know. I just want her gone at this point.",

        "text": "I posted about our previous day care of three years [here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterNarcissism/comments/4uwqu2/my_daycare_lady_basically_just_dumped_us_out_of/) and how out of the blue and unprofessional that was. MAJOR TRIGGERS for me.\n\nWe ended up finding a great new fit. It was seriously less expensive and just my kids and hers because she wanted friends for her kids. Well, after three days of being there, she texted me and said she can't do it any more (but will watch them for at least two weeks as per our contract). She said that she spent so much time trying to make my son feel comfortable that her son (same age) felt neglected and would cry after he left. She said he told her that was the only way to get attention from her. She also said her husband hid in their room because he couldn't handle all the crying. Which I get-at least these are straight up and valid reasons. She is even trying to help me find someone else. \n\nBut it triggers me so badly. All my abandonment issues. All my desires for my kid to fit in and accepted like I never was. All my trust issues. I am devastated and feel horrible. I can't help but wonder if its me or my kid (and I know it's not. She just thought this would be easy money and an easy job and it was more difficult than she expected. IDK what she expected with two toddlers and two newborns though... I did ask her multiple times if she could handle it). \n\nSo now I have to scramble to find new care within our budget-which for 2 kids is slim pickings. I am hoping to find someone to come to our house bc my husband and I go opposite directions for work. And I don't have any family near by that Im not NC with. Its so hard to (a) find someone who will take a newborn and (b) that I can trust.\n\nI just don't have it in me right now. I am so upset. Thank GOD I'm starting with a new therapist tomorrow.",

        "text": "My wife died this summer after a three-year battle with cancer. The marriage wasn't good for a long time. For years, people have suggested to me she was abusive, but it's only since her death that some have suggested she may have been NPD. She fits enough of the traits, but I'm not eager to dive headlong into the \"I'm a victim\" rabbithole. Still, I want to be smart going forward.\n\nI realize that I have work to do to unpack the false messages she'd convinced me to believe, and to relearn who I really am, and what's really okay.\n\nI'm starting a FWB relationship with a woman who's convinced HER ex-husband was/is a narcissist, too.\n\nWe're both in our early 40s and each very smart. Being smart doesn't guarantee making smart decisions.\n\nWhat I'm wondering, from your experience and wisdom, is ... is there anything I should be careful of in entering this arrangement? \n\nAre two narcissist-abuse escapees likely to collide with predictable bad results? Are we likely to be codependent, validation-seeking, clingy, scared, .... or maybe even liberated, hedonistic and safely expansive?\n\nI consider myself very self-aware, but readily admit I'm probably still in some fog of grief, so if I'm stepping into a minefield dressed up as a flower garden, I'd love some insight.\n\nMany thanks.",

        "text": "I want to thank everyone who commented on my last post. And also those who sent get well wishes. \n\n  My mom is home and it's been a bit hard but my husband and I are working as a team to make sure that she recovers from being ill. \n\n  I spoke to a few family friends after she got home and one offered to fly out but she is ill herself we thanked her but told her no. And also told her that I was so glad we weren't alone. \n\n  My mom kept apologizing for get sick and she feels bad she almost died and scared everyone. I know the feeling I almost died a few years ago and it took me a long time to stop feeling bad about almost having died. So I know it's a nuts to apologize for almost having died but I also know what to say as well. So that helps. \n\n  Something she said really hit me hard. That she had at least done a good job raising one of her daughters. \n\n  My Nsister in her words would have found someone to dumped her on. And then use it her illness as an excuse to take time off work. \n\n  She did that with my Nfather a lot. \n \n  When she was really sick and still in the ICU. I guess she told the staff about my Nsister a bit and they said that they see this type of family issues all the time. And that they were comfortable sending her home with us. \n\n  I just wanted to cry because after all the nasty behavior when my Nfather was sick and on deaths door all I heard was how it was all my fault even though I didn't live with him and my Nsister did as well as I lived across the country for years. \n\n  My mom took my hand and said you are not Nsister's name that there has never been a score board with me. Unlike my Nsister who keeps track of what everyone owes her in her head. \n\n  My mom has decided to update her paperwork again with a very clear statement that says my Nsister has zero say in her care again. As well as to make it more recent since it hasn't been updated in a few years so that if Nsister somehow finds out she can't argue that it no longer applies. \n\n  I love my mom. ",

        "text": "Probably a long winded back story:\n\nI've recently gone NC with the mother. Growing up, it was always a mine field regarding her moods and what she would allow. One thing I remember was that I would stop asking friends over because I was usually met with \"we'll see\" or some bullshit excuse. Or she would be tired or angry, or even ignore the question all together. \n\nChores were a huge thing in the house. She made up chore charts and assigned them to my brother and me. We were to keep that house clean and they were more important over our schoolwork. If things weren't done, she wasn't happy no matter the reason. As I got older, it would get to the point that in order for me to gain courage to let her know I was going out, I would quickly do some cleaning in order to show her I did something and get her to approve my request. \n\nWe were never given attention other than the 'consolation hug' after arguments or being yelled at. Didn't know this wasn't normal until staying with some cousins in another state and seeing their dynamic with my aunt and uncle. It crushed my little heart and my mother never changed it when I brought it up. She always maintained that we were shown love and affection. \n\nI was boy crazy in school, had crushes on guys that showed a bit of interest in me. Had a string of high schools relationships that I shouldn't have entered because they just were a waste of time, but my little attention starved heart thought there wasn't anything wrong. They showed me attention! (Nothing sexual. Didn't actually loose the V card until I was 18). \n\nFast forward to 23, shit hit the fan with mother after I break up with a guy I was living with and she ADORED {she still follows him on social media to this day, and he also has a new gf}, I moved out and remove any trace of her control over my life, accounts etc and move in with my dad. I'm healing and have a new relationship that I really want with a guy and we are a great match. \n\n\n\nTwo years in, we live together and my emotional baggage is ruining things. He works long hours during the week and has like half days Saturday's. He gets Friday's and Sunday's off. I work the typical 8:30-5 M-F. During the week I take care of things, but when it comes to his days off, I expect him to just help me out (he's admitted that he should be doing more to help). It's gotten to where I feel like my needs aren't being met because I'm stuck in the \"look at all the things I've done for you and do for you, can I have attention?\"  Which is eerily similar to growing up. And it doesn't seem to stick that he's exhausted, wants some time to decompress and has his own pressure from work to noodle through. \nHe's affectionate (hugs and hand holding and the such) but the intimacy hasn't happened for 5 weeks. He says he loves me, and I believe him. \nWhat I can't understand is why affection is such a huge thing for me in this relationship, especially sexual, when I couldn't care less in my previous one.  \n\nI'm happy otherwise. Honestly, I am. \n\nBut this keeps coming up and I feel like I'm going to ruin this relationship if I can't figure it out how to fix it. \n\nI'm in counseling and have been for about 3/4 ish months. Could this be a thing because now I'm having to deal with and unpack all the crap from the mother? \n\nIs it possible to have a healthy relationship with someone without the baggage making a mess of things? How do you let it go? \n\nTL;DR: I think my emotional baggage from my mother is going to ruin my relationship with my boyfriend ",
