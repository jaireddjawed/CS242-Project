        "text": "Dear Diary,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDiscouragement.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am being overwhelmed by my emotions at this very moment. My head twists and my heart aches.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSeeing her leave the room with her sex toys to find her client, when she told me she was only going for 'lunch' with him makes my heart ache so much and my head hurts. I am currently unable to think straight. My mind is pre-occupied from thinking of throwing my phone right at the wall and wanting to vent out all of my feelings by shouting and beating myself up. It would've been much better if she said she was doing sexual intercourse, though it would still affect me because of the sex toys but it would've felt less overwhelming. I do not like to be lied to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI once again have asked too many questions during the time when she is very pre-occupied. It hurts to hear her say 'STOP ASKING!!'. I merely wish to care for her, and yet this is what i get in return.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's my fault.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy heart aches even more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want to start punching myself on the head again, so i won't be overwhelmed by my feelings, one of the coping mechanism i found years ago and am still using currently. I may or may not change it to suffocating myself, although it feels like it could help me. I should try it soon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDiscussion of being emotionally overwhelmed is Discouraged. Because no one likes to deal with emotionally unstable \\*insert your name\\*. Only i have myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThinking of another guy fucking her or playing sex toys with her really fucks my brain up. I just want to sit out at the window right now and just jump off the building so i won't feel these overwhelming feelings again. Even though i said i won't judge and i do not judge, does not mean i am not affected in the slightest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did say i would throw these feelings aside. But in truth, its just to make her feel better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n My brain hurts. My heart aches.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease release me from this pain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI beg you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBanging my head against the wall until i faint is the thing i am thinking of right now. But it will complicate others, so i will not do it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can only repress my own feelings. But for how long can i repress it for? Every time i say i am fine, but i am not. I am never fine. Why do i even say i am? Why do i even hide it at all? I have never been truthful infront of anyone, because they will all go away the moment i become myself - vulnerable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy am i doing this to myself? Being in a relationship that is most toxic to me? How are other guys doing it? Don't they love their girlfriends? How do they not feel like shit? How do they not get overwhelmed by these feelings? How do they even eat?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShould i take drugs to cope with these? I'd get an overdose for sure. She is different from my other exes, i'd probably take more dosages than i usually take to repress these feelings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess the answer would be drugs since self harm is the next most dangerous thing, and drugs welcomes me with open arms and an open mind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI need to change myself as a person, how my mind and my heart feels, that is if i want to continue this relationship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust keep swimming \\~ swimming \\~ swimmi- No.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust keep eating \\~ eating \\~ eating \\~ eating \\~ eating \\~ my feelings away \\~. Just note to self that 'eating' means i am imagining a black hole demon opening it's mouth and eating all of my overwhelming feelings. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat's left of me is but an empty shell, just a body incapable of feeling anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA Laughter never true.\n\nA Cry never true.\n\nA Smile never true..never had been anyways.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRepression. Guilt. Fault. Discouragement.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am being eaten away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWalking to the train station in the rain. I started to laugh in my mind. Hahahahahaahahahahahahaha ahahahhahahahahahahahshshshshshahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahshshhshahaaaa....am i about to cry? It must have been the rain..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI cock my head to the side for no reas-.....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHah....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n50 Shades? What a fucking joke.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n'What do you want to eat?' asked my good friend B. I replied 'Anything Bro'.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI stayed silent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not hungry. I am full from eating my own emotions and feelings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHahahahahahahahahahahahahhahaahaha\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHah...Fuck.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow i wish breathing was optional.",

However, one particular male coworker, whom I have reason to believe is gay (I make note of this only because it may be relevant to the story), stood up to hug me but put his right forearm in front of his junk to create a separation between our crotches. Like, it was clear that he was protecting himself against something. First time I've ever experienced anything like this. I respect this person greatly and the encounter has me completely stumped. Did I cross a line? Do I owe this person an apology or an amends? I truly wish to understand if there is a cultural or community boundary I crossed.",

Moved in with my mom and got kicked out of there... And then finally moved into a sober living house and decided to change my life. My daughter was with me through it all, and now I'm happy to be guiding her through my recovery and life is so much better for us now. I love my daughter, she is so resilient and if I could go back in time for none of that roller coaster to happen, I would. \n\nOn the contrary.. I miss my cat so very much, it pains my heart. I have more guilt over giving up my kitty than I do anything else. I think it comes down to the fact that I know my daughter is okay. I don't know if my Stormy girl is okay.. but I pray everyday that she's comfortable where she's at. And I wish I hadn't been such a piece of shit, so much so, that I had to drop my cat off, after having her for 4 years.

        "text": "I managed a pizza place a long time ago. I worked there for 6 years, and the owners of the store were just the most miserable people you could ever imagine. 4 years in, I got promoted as one of the two managers. \n\nI’ll save the in between stuff, unless it’s requested in the comments, but during my first year, they had a habit of not paying out promised bonuses, taking money out of paychecks, and not paying OT pay after 40 hours, despite being paid hourly (I worked roughly 60 hours a week)\n\nI closed the store 6 nights a week because the other manager had kids at home and wanted to be there in the evenings with them. Part of the duties included closing out the cash register and depositing the money in a nearby bank. We had a box underneath the counter that had keys to the 5 deposit bags. We had two deposit bags that were noticeably newer than the other 3, and the keys to these bags also reflected that. I also noticed these new bags had 3-4 copies of the same key. This is when my mind started working. \n\nI devised a plan where, when I thought I could get away with it, not ring up cash orders. I mostly did this on slices, as they were very often overlooked in the system. Each cash slice bit rung up would put $4.21 in the drawer. I could further add extra money to the drawer by adding on coupons to cash orders that did not have a coupon (coupons were not inventoried, and often offered verbally). Throw in an order that I would void out completely after the customer picked up, and I could have days where there was upwards of $100 extra in the drawer from what the system would show. \n\nTo make this plan work, I had been able to sneak one of each of those extra keys out of that box and into my car. I would make sure when I deposited, that I used one of those two bags. I would put all the cash in the bag as I normally should, but when I wrote out the deposit slip, I would write the amount, minus however much the drawer would show over. Once I got out to my vehicle, I’d open the bag back up and take out the extra money before depositing. \n\nI did this for roughly a year. There was never a word going around about missing money. No one ever questioned my practices with not ringing up slice orders. Idk what my total amount taken was, but I had a jar at home I was saving money in for driving school, and I had over 2 grand in there when I quit. A lot more of it was left at the bar on those very same nights though lol. \n\nI don’t regret it, and I would have done it again. I’ve worked for three other companies over the years that would have been so easy to steal money from, but never once felt tempted to. Those people were awful, and deserved it. I wasn’t the only one who thought as, as several years later an employee or former employee broke into their restaurant at night, smashed the computers and stole the start of day money that we had hidden in the microwave each night. My only regret is I didn’t think to do it sooner. \n\nI guess if there’s a moral to this story, if you own a business, don’t treat employees in a manner that would make them want to rob you. Bad people are going to rob you regardless, but that kind of treatment made an otherwise honest employee decide to do that. \n\nOh, and the statute of limitations on this ran out quite sone time ago, so I’m not worried about someone finding out, and the owners no longer own the place.",
