Kevin was just blowing up his phone but he couldn't pay him any attention and he felt guilty for ignoring him. \n\nI couldn't believe it but I'd just had the exact same dream, from the multiple texts to the guilt for being distracted and ignoring Kevin. But on some level I sort of wasn't surprised this happened, my boyfriend and I have been together for 7 years now (since I was 14) and in a lot of ways we are the same person. I guess that's what happens when you spend so much time with someone you love. We always end up doing stuff at the same time/same way, like finishing meals in unison for example, happens constantly. In a lot of ways we've synced up so I guess it was only a matter of time before this happened. I know it's not the craziest thing that's ever happened but we found it pretty funny and thought you guys might appreciate it too.",

        "text": "It all started with a date that I went on Friday night. Our conversation switched to Reddit. I didn't know much about Reddit, and I still do not. One of the topics from our conversation on Reddit was Matrix glitches. My date proceeded to explain to me about Matrix Glitch group here on Reddit, where people explain the glitches they have experienced. That had me intrigued about Matrix Glitch. Side note, I just saw Matrix last week for the first time, and I think it is a great movie. \nThe funny thing is that the same night I experienced something similar, but it couldn't be a glitch because I experienced it in my dream. After I dropped my date, I drove home and went to bed pretty tired. My dream began with me and my date driving, she made a move to make out with me while I was driving. Then there was a flash of light from a truck that was about to struck us. Making out with her felt extremely real. Right after the flash of light, I realized I was in the dream and then I told my self it's just a matrix glitch. Then I woke up, I started experiencing sleeping paralysis. I was trying hard to fight the dark being that was pressing on me. After a few minutes, I suddenly wake up and realized it was all a dream. Then I look at my clock it was 11:00 AM. I was suppose to drive to Charlottesville at 6:00 AM in the morning. I am all worried because my friend who is waiting for me in Charlottesville is definitely going to be angry at me for being late. Right when I was panicking about being late, I actually woke up from the real dream, and it was only 6:00 AM in the morning.\nThe thing that blew my mind is that I had dreams within dream.  All my sleeping paralysis in the past was felt on real time, but this time my sleeping paralysis took place within the dream. I saw a post from someone claiming that anything related to dreams is not a glitch in the Matrix, but glitchinthematrix was the closest subreddit I could post this to.\nSo, here is my first reddit post on sleeping paralysis and dreams with in dream about glitch in the Matrix.

        "text": "So for anyone who isn't aware, the Mandela Effect began when someone had an argument with a friend over whether or not Nelson Mandela had died in prison. I thought he did. I remember when I was a kid I was watching the History Channel and they were doing a documentary about him and I was so sure they were talking about how he died in prison, they even had someone go into his cell and they were talking about what a great man he was. \nAs a Google search will tell you, he didn't die in prison, he died in 2013. This is one of dozens of things that people are remembering differently, the other more famous incident being the Bearenst(e)ain Bears controversy. Again, I remember it with an E. I used to wonder if it was \"steen\" or \"stine\", I read at an eleventh grade level when I was in the fourth grade so I know I would have been able to tell if it was \"Stain\". \nI'll go ahead and include a list of other changes that are personally making me insane. I'll post the way it is now o first, and then next to it i'll put the way I remember it. I know there are other posts about this but it's bothering me so much that I need to go ahead and write it down. My roommate and I have been binge watching videos about it and she's gone for the day and I need to talk about this some more.\n\nFebreze - Febreeze,\nFroot Loops - Fruit Loops,\nLooney Tunes - Looney Toons,\nCap'n Crunch - Captain Crunch,\nOscar Mayer - Oscar Meyer,\nCharles Schulz - Charles Schultz,\nInterview With the Vampire - Interview With a Vampire,\nIf you build it, he will come - If you build it, they will come,\nThe positions of South America and Australia, Russia in relation to Alaska, the sizes of China and Mongolia, and the shape of Korea. \nDrano - Draino,\nSkechers - Sketchers,\n\nSo those are the ones that are really getting to me. I understand that human memory is super unreliable sometimes, and I know that everyone wants to claim that they personally are the exception and that they can remember everything. But I just want to say that while there are definitely a lot of things I can't remember from childhood, but some of these things were such a part of my everyday life that I almost can't believe I would remember it wrong. For me the biggest part of this that make me believe that this could have any real grounds is the feeling I get when I realize what these things are now called and I have this intense feeling inside that it's just super off.

It felt like he was real, and I had no memory of his death at that moment.\n\nWhen I woke up I noticed a facebook notification on my phone. It was a post written that morning by his sister, in honor of the anniversary of his passing. It was accompanied by a wall of wonderful sentiments about the pastor and his wife, and well wishes toward their two children, who were left parentless.\n\nFacebook reminded me of his birthday a couple of days ago, so this story came to mind. It happened two or three months ago, don't feel like wading through facebook posts to find the date.",

        "text": "I'm pretty new to Reddit so if there's some other thread this is better suited for, please let me know!\n\nSo around a year and a half ago I was getting ready to go to town. Where I live is about three miles from downtown and it takes me usually exactly eight minutes to drive from my house down the road into town to where the first bank clock is. I know this because I had to transfer the store I worked at and I had to drive the same way every day and I have this huge thing about knowing what time it is so i'm not late. So anyway, eight minutes.\n\nWhen I thought to myself that I should leave it was 10:51 a.m. The only things that I had to do was to put my shoes on, grab my purse, and say goodbye to my dogs and fill their water. I then got into my car and went to town, and when I go to the first bank clock the time was 11:34 a.m. My immediate though was that the clock must be off, so I keep driving and when I pass the next bank clock it says 11:36 a.m. It only takes me eight minutes to get to town. It took me five minutes to leave the house. I should have gotten to the first bank clock at about 11:05. Even if it took me twice as long to leave the house I still should have been there at 11:10. The rest of the day I felt really disoriented because I couldn't understand what had happened.\n\nSo fast forward to about a week or two ago, and I'm in my room, again getting ready to go to town. I look at my t.v. because I have Chromecast and it always has the clock up, and the time is 8:56 a.m. I'm like radical, I'll leave soon and get everything done early. So when i'm almost ready to leave I check the clock and it says 9:04 a.m. and again i'm like sweet, I should be done with all my errands by noon.\n\nA few minutes later i'm about to turn the t.v. off to leave and I happen to check the time again, surprise, and it says 8:58 a.m. I didn't feel so disoriented, probably because I didn't lose any time, but it was still really weird. Has anyone else lost any time?",

        "text": "I think this likely doubles as the Mandela effect, but I'm posting here because... I don't know. It's just too weird and I want people to see it and weigh in on it and acknowledge it's too weird to be a false memory. \n\nSo I'll detail this chronologically and it requires my real birthday (or an approximation, apparently). I'm not too concerned with privacy and who knows? Maybe one of you guys might answer back with a \"oh, your town was heavily gassed and retconned, that's why...\". So I'm using bare facts here. First off, hello: my name is Hillery. \n\nI am the third of four children. My mom was pretty open about our births, so I know my story pretty well. We were all fast births except her last, my little brother (who was c-section). With my older sister, the docs tried turning her away because she wasn't dilated far enough and it didn't look like she would deliver for another several hours at least. She partially delivered in the foyer minutes later and they noted in her chart that she was fast to deliver. Then came my older brother. Same story, only this time the docs had the note from last time and ***still*** turned her away, figuring the first time was a fluke. It was not, he was nearly born in a toilet before they took her back. \n\nThen came me. The story goes that my dad was working just far enough away that it was better for him to stay on-site during the work week and and only come home for the weekends (it was a temporary position that payed very well). The big worry was that, if she went in to labor during the week, he wouldn't have been able to make it home in time before I was born. My due date was mid week, so the week before she was walking around the neighborhood with her friends trying to 'shake me loose' to no avail. Dad went to work early Monday morning. The whole following week she was tense - every twinge could mean she was about to give birth all alone. \n\nI was a good baby, though. I didn't officially knock on the doors and ask out until early Friday evening, when my dad was already on his way home. Mom met him at the gate that was the entrance to the neighborhood and (after she clambered in to the truck) turned right around and headed to the hospital. I was officially born that night at 10:13 PM, Friday, August 7th. It was the day before my dad's birthday (August 8th). \n\nFriday. August 7th. Friday. \n\nAs the poem goes:\nMonday's child is fair of face,\nTuesday's child is full of grace,\nWednesday's child is full of woe,\nThursday's child has far to go,\nFriday's child is loving and giving,\nSaturday's child works hard for a living,\nBut the child who is born on the Sabbath day,\nIs lucky and happy and good and gay.\n\nHear that? I'm loving and giving! Anyway, there were a handful of times throughout my life that this has come up. I've always been born on a Friday. One birthday I got a little novelty book detailing all the other stuff that happened on Friday, August 7th. One time my mom showed me a many years calendar and explained how it worked. Of course, once I could do the current date, how else could I test it? Well, if I just line up august and the seventh... yup, there's Friday. It works!\n\nTime passes. My daughter is born shortly before I turn 24. More time passes and I have a son at 28. \n\n28 years being born on Friday, August 7th, 1982. Shortly after son is born, I'm on the computer looking at his birth date and birth day and all the stuff that's happened that day this year or historically. I learned his most famous birthday buddy was Glenn Beck - that was sorta depressing. \n\nSo then I look at other birthdays, starting at Wikipedia and venturing out in to the wild google. If this is exceptionally odd behavior I choose to blame the pain meds that come with a c-section, but for now I think this was a relatively normal line of inquiry. At any rate, I ask google about August 7th, 1982. \n\nGoogle says sure, what would you like to know about Saturday, August 7th, 1982? \n\nSaturday? \n\nI'd just had my son, I didn't want to deal with this. I knew my best bet would be to talk to my mom and maybe jog her memory a bit and we'd get to the bottom of it. Who gives a shit what day of the week you're born on, right?\n\nSo maybe I misremembered?  I finally talk to mom and ask her when I was born. \"Friday, August 7th! I remember sitting in the bathtub with my legs crossed telling you to stay in until your dad came home.\" \n\nSo I say \"Well, I just looked it up and Google says August 7th of 1982 was a Saturday.\"\n\n\"What? Well, it's wrong. It was a Friday. You should complain to their boss.\"\n\n\"Well, seriously ma: what are the chances you're just not remembering it properly?\"\n\n\"None. Your dad can confirm that. He didn't even get to go home first before he took us to the hospital.\"\n\nSo maybe google fucked up and I'm the rogue who's going to expose their dirty deeds! But wait! Remember that novelty book I mentioned? It says Saturday now, too! Remember that several years' calendar I mentioned? It says Saturday as well! WTF!?!\n\nI know it seems silly but it's so weird. Making it Saturday makes sure none of the other details work. My birth certificate still says 10:13 Pm August 7th, so there's no chance of a \"Well, very late Friday night but apparently it was actually Saturday morning\" type gaffe. \n\nI keep hanging out at the end here trying to come up with an appropriate finish, but I've got nothing. It's just a weird detail I can't figure out and I just hope people read this and think, at the very least, that it's really too stupid to be faked, and that it therefore might actually be real. I'm going to hit 'submit' before it changes to Sunday for no reason. Wait for me years from now to ask you what day of the week it is. Maybe there's been synchronization issues in the multiverse...",

Now, I didn't pray for anything ridiculous or impossible. I prayed that tomorrow I would find $1.00. \n\nThe next day at school, guess what I see on the floor as I'm changing classes? A $1.00 bill. Crazy, right? It gets better.\n\nSo I think, \"OK, that could just be a coincidence.\" That night I pray for something different. I pray that I'll get a girl's number. Now, at that point in my life, I have never kissed a girl, been on a date, or even asked a girl out. Getting a number was something that I has never happened before.\n\nSchool rolls around the next morning, and I talk with this girl I've been sitting next to all year. You know, like any other day. I forgot what I said, but she starts writing her number on a piece of paper in my 3 ring binder. I remember sitting there as she's writing it and thinking, \"holy shit..\" Something that's never happened in my life up until now is happening right after I prayed for it the night before.\n\nAnd of course I dismiss it as another \"coincidence\". To this day I still consider myself non-religious or Atheist, but I still can't forget what happened.",

We were supposed to head out to an event organised by the university in another city and I had offered to pick her up from campus. On my way there, about 2km away from campus, my tires slipped on what I presume was sand ( a construction site was nearby ). 30 seconds before my accident, I checked my phone to switch songs and it said 11:33 AM. The area itself is rather mountainous and after I lost control of the vehicle and it swerved off the road, straight into a relatively steep valley. I remember being awake the whole time and I refrained from blinking for reasons I'm not aware of to this very day.. The gadarene slide came to a halt after I slammed into a tree, completely defacing my car. My windshield was shattered but the glass was still in place. I was breathing quickly and my hands still clasped firmly to the steering wheel. After what seemed like 30 seconds, I became fully aware of my situation but was still in this state of confusion and panic which made the whole thing seem dream-like. I exited the car through the passenger door,after killing the engine which was still whining, because mine was jammed. It seemed like it had taken me 2 minutes in total to exit the car, which had no smoke coming out of it. I saw several workers from the construction site nearby running into the the valley telling me they thought they had only expected to find a lifeless corpse due to how long I had been in there and how brutal the accident was. I was too distraught and confused to say anything consistent and they helped me climb back up to the road. I saw two students from my university standing there, one of them gestured for me to grab his hand so he could help me up. They told me that they saw a cloud of smoke from where they were standing at the university and suddenly had the urge to get on site. My car had no smoke coming out of it... What's even weirder is that their car was 5 minutes away from their hangout spot at the university, and the ride to the location of my accident had to be at least 2 minutes long. I gazed at my phone in disbelief and it was 11:36 AM..",

        "text": "I'm sure there's a better subreddit for this, but I like this community so figured I'd post it here.\n\nThere are a few things to get out of the way first. This happened to my cousin, not me, and the timing of this event have a few people in my family freaked out because it occurred on the day that we suspect my uncle may have passed away.\n\nSo a little backstory, my uncle was found dead in his apartment early this week (he was in poor health for a while) and it's believed he was there for at least 5 days. This was established by checking sent and received calls and the last time anyone saw him. On Tuesdays he had to move his car from the street but then moves it back to the street at a certain time (municipal thing, I think scheduled sweeping or something). We know he moved his car last Tuesday so he died after that at some time. Possibly that day, maybe Wednesday or as late as Thursday, it's unclear. I don't even like writing all this out, in all honesty, so there's a chance I'll end up deleting this post or edit out some of these details later.\n\nTo the \"glitch.\"\n\nSo my mom just told me that my cousin was home alone in the basement last Tuesday when he heard a loud bang come from upstairs. He went to check what happened and [found this](https://imgur.com/dY4Kq5H).\n\nThe lamp shade is made of glass and isn't screwed in or being held, it can be removed easily. The table it was on has a raised border around the edge so if it was pushed by force it's highly improbable it would fall like this. Also there are clearly books lined up on the ground (I'm not sure where these were, I'll have to ask my uncle or cousin about it). The whole scene is just strange as hell.\n\nThe first thing they thought was a break in. Possible, but why the hell would someone come in just to do this? Maybe it's someone with a mental disorder who happens to pick locks? Also, they have a dog and she didn't bark at all the whole time (not even with the bang he heard, which I find odd).\n\nSo that's it. Not the craziest thing I've read on this subreddit, but an odd unexplained occurrence. Now my uncle thinks his brother's spirit did this and my cousin is freaked out because he doesn't know what the hell happened. Glitch? Ghost? Hobo? The dog did it?\n\nEdit: This got weirder. So my uncle's favorite band was The Beatles. Biggest fan of them I've ever met. He had a FB fanpage and everything. The only face up book we were able to see is \"Through the Looking Glass.\" My sister was looking into it and found that Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds was inspired by Alice in Wonderland. Could absolutely be a coincidence. My uncle doesn't want to tell his son to freak him out more, but I really want to know where the books were.",

Its about The Mandela Effect but it is also a personal glitch so i'll post it here and at GlitchInTheMatrix, please correct me if it should elsewhere...  \nI discovered the Berenstein Bears were the Berenstain Bears in July 2015, and have been obsessed with finding more changes ever since. I found as many pages as i could on the net relating to the changes and keep updated daily on chat forums etc. Have researched Theoretical Quantum Physics to death, and science fiction among other things, looking for answers.\nVery early on i discovered having a marker, like in the movie Inception with Leo DiCaprio, (he had a spinning top), was a good idea. One of my markers was Corey Haim. He was sooo popular when i was teen, and his death was such a tragedy that there is no way my memories could be wrong about him! I have been checking his death date hasnt changed for over six months. Until last week, when i discovered he died in 2010 and not 1989 like my previous timeline! wtf?! I was heart broken when he died, as was the rest of teen culture of the time! Now i have been able to see him all grown up! but what a friggin tragedy his adulthood became :( so sad! It would have been lovely to jump to a timeline where he was alive and happy. Have also discovered heaps of movies he made in this timeline that i never knew, as well as that horrible looking real life show he did with Corey Feldman. His last movie was Dream a Little Dream in my old place.\nI truly believe we are jumping timelines constantly, Corey Haim was just one of my markers that has changed, but it is one that i cannot, without a doubt, refute in my memory. The most horrible thing about jumping timelines is losing the details of memories - i cannot for the life of me remember what date in '89 Haim died, and i cannot remember if it was an accident or not. One part of me wants to say overdose, but im now no longer sure... Does anyone else remember him dieing in the 80's? \nAnother recent 'alive again' i have noticed is Alan Alda, he previously died in 2011, any corroboration much appreciated - i fear i may be alone with these two changes.\nDo you have markers that have changed?",

I finished a delivery in La Jolla just before 7pm, and was waiting in my car for the next order to come in. I got the text and app notification at 7:02 and started on my way to the restaurant. At 7:04 another text comes in that says \"Your RedCard (individually assigned debit card we use)  payment at Tumeric Tai  was more than we expected, if this is okay there is no need to call.\" It's the standard message we get when the amount charged to the card is like $10 more than the app expects. I'm about 10 minutes away from the restaurant still, so I thought that's a weird bug, maybe someone else swiped my order on accident? So I get there and grab the order, and ask to see the receipt to be sure, it looked right at first glance, and the total was about $10 more. Sometimes the app menu pricing is different than the current menu, so I didn't think anything of it, swiped the card, then went to my car. Then, for some reason, I double checked the receipt, and saw an extra item. So I rushed back in to returned it and gave him the receipt, and they did the correct refund.\nNo big deal, right? Wrong. As soon as I got back outside, I realized that I received that correct overcharge text message 10 minutes before I was even at the restaurant, before my card was swiped, and never received another overcharge message after I paid. \nThese are automated delivery systems, so how could the DoorDash system be triggered to send an overcharge message before that information is created? If it was a bug, why didn't I receive the true overcharge message AFTER my card was swiped?",

Orders are getting called and the lobby is getting less full, then I heard \"Order for Joe\" (not my real name), and I was confused because I didn't give the cashier my name and I didn't pay by credit card, which would have my name on it. I got up and looked and it seemed to be my order, but it was for eat in not to go. I brought the issue up, but they just looked at me like I was crazy. The one guy even said \"If you paid by card\" and I stopped him and said I paid by cash, leaving both him and the cashier looking at each other then at me. I drove home, and the order was the right one. \nTL;DR Taco Bell knew my name without giving it to them.",

        "text": "This was a long time ago and is probably the most vivid early childhood memory I have. I remember almost nothing from younger than age five, but this memory is a singular episode that has stuck with me for more than 40 years.\n\nI was a toddler, approximately a year and a half old. For context and those of you who are familiar with typical American homes, I grew up in a center hall colonial. My bedroom was on the second floor and the staircase was L-shaped with a landing about three quarters of the way up and a turn to the right to ascend the remainder of the steps.\n\nHere is where it gets strange. My small child self wakes up and pads my way down the hall to the top of the stairs. I'm still young enough so that descending the staircase is an adventure fraught with peril.\n\nI distinctly remember pausing at the top of the stairs while gripping the banister post to contemplate my situation, but at that moment I felt myself begin to float slowly and gently down the stairs. I remember touching down softly at the bottom. I then walked into the kitchen where my mother, father and all my siblings were having breakfast before work and school.\n\nMy unexpected arrival caused a bit of a freak out and questioning about how I traversed the stairs by myself and some concerned, but loving admonitions against using the stairs unchaperoned. I recounted my tale of weightless flight much to the amusement of my family.\n\nFor the sake of clarity, I was the youngest child by nine years. My entire family was on the first floor when this occurred and there was no one else in the house. I never felt as if there was any other \"entity\" involved or any sense that I was not alone when this took place.\n\nAs I described, this has stuck with me for decades. I have no history of sleepwalking at any time in my life, before or since. I have never had another experience like this and as I said, I have literally no other memories from that young or even years older beyond flashes, but this I can recall like it happened yesterday.",

        "text": "My coworker suggested I posted this here, nothing really has come of it yet but it happened a few weeks ago. \nI was sitting in my kitchen with 3 room mates and a friend, playing magic the gathering and watching silly YouTube videos. Totally average laid back night. Through our giggling we heard a knock at the front door, which was weird for two reasons; 1.) No one who visits us knocks, we have the 'walk right in' kinda house. 2.) Never has ever used the front door. Our side door is just way more convenient. \nWe joked about whoever is was must be a Total noob' and my roommate Dave went to answer it. I didn't even care to look who it could be until I heard the strange voice say my name, and when I looked over my roommate was talking to a cop. Shit. My stomach sropped as I assumed I must have some kind of silly warrant for an unpaid fine or something. Never have I been arrested, but when I stood up to walk over I assumed that could be the only reason a cop would want to speak to me. The officer stepped aside as I walked outside and immediately I froze. Stretching across the entire side of my street were different variations of squad cars, all with their lights off. I counted at least seven before my eyes darted to three more officers approaching me. No way had I commited a crime bad enough to send the whole force to my house, it had to be something else. \n\"You said you were Kathrine T****?\"\n\"yes....is my family okay? What's wrong?\"\n\nI started getting a little frantic and all the officers were looking at me with these sad puppy dog eyes. The officer that was questioning me didn't answer me at first, and without breaking eye contact, spoke into is walkie talkie. \n\"I'm with Kathrine right now...she seems fine, at the moment..\"\n\"Can you please tell me what's going on??\"\n\"That's what we're trying to figure out.\"\n\nHonestly I almost started crying thinking my family was in danger or something. They live far away and I always worry about them. At this point my friend came outside and stood with me to make sure everything was going okay.  That's when we finally started getting more information as to what was going on. The officer asked me if I had a cell phone, which I told him I did, technically, but it was a pay-as-you-go junk bomb I never put minutes on and could use as a computer when wifi was around, but calls and texts weren't an option. Then he told me I looked a little different in my ID photo then  I do now. I guess they must be able to look it up or something? I've never really been in law trouble but I assume that's how he would have known what my ID looked like, since I hadn't shown it to him yet. I nodded. In my ID photo my hair was blue, now it was green. \n\"Well, we have a Kathrine T****** on the phone with us now, crying, screaming, says she doesn't know where she is and the phone she is calling us from is a restricted number.\"\nWe both stood there quiet for a second, until my friend chimed in vouching I had been with them all day.  I suggested the obvious, maybe it was just someone with the same name? My last name is pretty unique especially in the low populated area I'm from, but always possible, right? The officer shook his head. \nHe told me she spelled Kathrine the same weird way mines spelled missing the middle 'e' (Katherine) from the normal way, middle and last name matched, not only that but through her hysterics she was able to tell them she was from the same small town as me, and give them my childhood address. They only found my new address because I had updated it with the rmv everytime I had moved, including this house. The officer still looked confused.\n\"I mean, we still have her on the phone we are just unable to trace the call, honestly she sounds like she is in danger. We can hear another voice in the background but can't make out what they're saying.\" \nI regret not asking to listen or speak to her, but I don't think they would of let me. After asking me if I have any enemies -which to my knowledge, I don't- they pretty much wrapped it up and left. \n\nAfter that my roommates and I joked about alternate universe shit, time travel, but didn't take it too seriously as I wrote it off as a prank. Although what bothers me is all the information she used that matched up to mine. Almost no one who knows me knows my middle name, I don't even go by my first name, and haven't kept in touch with any friends from my hometown. For someone to have some of that information is likely, but all of it? A little weird. Needless to say ive been a little shaken up about it when I think of the 'glitch' possibility, mostly when I am alone. I keep trying to come up with reasons it was 'just a prank' but what if it was a time glitch phone call of something that's going to happen? \nHaven't contacted the station for a follow up yet, but at this point thinking I should, at least to get some resolution from it.",

After looking around for a while I spotted the device I needed on a cluttered table off to one side of the room. I went over to the table and reached for the dvm and was totally shocked when my hand disappeared into the device. After jerking my hand back I took a closer look at the table. Everything looked normal, the dvm I had put my hand through looked solid, opaque, and just as real and normal as anything else in the lab. I emphasize the opacity and detail of what I saw; there was no translucency or fuzziness in what I saw, and when I put my had through the dvm my hand completely disappeared. I couldn't see any vestige, fuzzy, dim or otherwise through or behind the dvm. The only odd thing was a long tube, about three or four feet long, maybe five inches in diameter, with what looked like a large fish-eye lens at one end. The lens was about a foot in diameter and the whole thing was pointed at the area where I found the dvm. At that point I figured I had stumbled upon the prototype of some advanced projection system and I'd better not disturb anything further, so I left the lab empty handed. I still to this day have no idea what sort of tech could produce such perfectly realistic images in thin air.",

I screamed, but then I blinked and everything went back to normal and my dad kept asking me what was wrong.\nA bit later I went into his and my mom's shared closet to see the \"ripped\" shirt hanging up. It was perfectly fine, not ripped or sewed up or anything.\nIt doesn't necessarily creep me out, but I definitely confused me.",

        "text": "So after having a heavy lunch I was watching some videos on youtube and felt drowsy, so i fell asleep right there. It was kind an weird position and angle. And generally when I sleep in weird positions(inside cars, trains while sitting up) I generally have a case of sleep paralysis. And this was like no other. \n\nExcept that while in this state, this time, The Joker(Heath Ledger) decides to show up, removes a black covering off my head and pins me down by the right arm and hold me by the neck. The moment this happens, I try to move my right arm, cant. \n\nTry to move my head, cant. \n\nSo I try to use my left arm(which is movable) and flay it around so I can move my head enough to be able to wake up. Give it a solid 20 seconds, and I am awake. I get up shake my head pondering over what just happened, and decide to go back to my nap, this time in a slightly less weird angle and position. And I drop to sleep in an instance.\n\nAnd then I find myself walking in a hallway, I go ahead and open a door, and enter a noisy room where I find The Joker sitting down on the left side. He looks at me and smiles. And at that moment I just shout HELL FUCKING NO! and turn back and walk out of the room. \n\nAnd right at that moment I wake up normally, go wash my face and go out for a walk. \n\nIt was more amusing than terrifying cause I have met the Joker several times in different dreams and with each recurring instance it has become more of a nuisance than a bad dream.\n\nHave you guys had any such recurring characters in your dreams as well?",

As she was listening and checking tumblr on her phone, the song currently playing was interrupted - much like one of those emergency warning tests. Here is what she recalled:\n\n\n*beep* *beep*...\n\n\nFemale electronic voice: \"One. One. One. Point. Zero. One. Three. Zero. One. One. Seven. Three. Zero. One. [111.0130117301]\"\n\n\n*silence*\n\n\nAnd then the song resumed from the exact point that it left off from when it was interrupted. I missed this by a minute, and she still looked shocked when I returned to the car. This happened on frequency 100.5 FM, The Katt (a rock station) in Oklahoma City at about 4:20 (ha ha) this afternoon\n\n\nAny ideas, friends?",

TL;DR: outside playing with friends, me and one friend both happen to look at the sky at the same time to watch it go black and then back. nobody else noticed.",

But I recently told her of my story I recently posted to here and some other events I've had happen to me and she began telling me that she sees herself die or someone else die followed by a bright flash weekly. I don't know if it's a mental disorder for her but apparently these events are not rare. Her most recent one she was walking with someone and was really sketched out and looked back. Some hooded figure chopped the guys head clean off and she caught it and just looked at it, a flash followed and they were in the same area so they got the hell out of there.\nIs this common for people?
