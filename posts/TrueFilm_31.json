        "text": "Watched it yesterday I felt it was a decent romance movie where love is lost in the end like (A Walk to Remember or The fault in our stars) yet i couldn't get it off my head and holy shit on the second viewing how could i be so dumb? They were on a continuous fight with their conscience the entire time, They didn't give up each other but didn't want to engage either. Mr. Chow knew he made a mistake falling in love with Su, still quite unsure he let Su decide for him.I didn't realize the first time that Su followed him to Singapore and the significance of the phone call she made there. It was tragic to watch her confront Mrs. Chow but keep herself intact cuz she's too polite. I loved the direction, cinematography and music, did get confused by editing though on first viewing. This experience will stick with me for years and I'll watch this dozens of time in my life and it will get better every time, that's the essence of a true drama. I'd like to know who does Su call before leaving for Singapore \"If i have an extra ticket would you come with me?\", my guess is her husband Mr. Chan? and what about the non-linear scenes at the hotel: Receptionist receives a call; Mr. Chow finds out something is missing from his room and he goes for lunch; Su waits for him in his room and calls the reception, hangs up and takes her slippers and leaves?",

        "text": "I absolutely recommend it, especially to anyone who enjoyed Taxi Driver. I'll share my thoughts about it with the assumptions that you've seen the film already so heads up, there might be some spoiler.\n\nThis was one of those movies where the way it's directed perfectly captures the feelings it's trying to convey. All the shots are still, most of them up close or really dark. I felt depressed and claustrophobic throughout the movie. There was so much visual loneliness in those shots where the reverend is alone in his house, drinking and writing in his diaries. It really stood out to me that the only time the camera moved is in the final shot when they were kissing, and I think when they were biking outside (possibly the only other moment in the film where he seems content and in tune with the world.)\n\nThis movie is saturated with parallels and contrasts. The central one being despair vs hope. But more prominently, the parallel between the Reverent not taking care of his health and body, and humanity not caring about the environment. I feel like this movie could have easily crossed the line that makes it preachy, but it never does. The environmentalist theme are always presented within a solipsistic context. In the beginning, Hawke's character tells the husband something along the lines of \"It's not about the kid, and it's not about Maria. It's about you, about your despair.\"\n\nThis captures the journey he goes through himself. As he cares more and more about the environment, he drinks more and more and cares less about his own health and body. His self-destructiveness, fed and amplified, with his health, his personal relationships; and the eventual extreme of wanting to blow himself up. I keep thinking back to Taxi Driver. The way Travis gets so obsessed with assassinating the presidential candidate, something he has no horse in, but is doing purely to spite his ex- an obsession that is a manifestation of his own loneliness and sorrow. And both characters fail in culminating their crazy plans and they somehow end up with a happy resolution.\n\nI didn't event realize this was a Paul Schrader feature and I kept thinking about Taxi Driver the whole time. It was definitely an \"oooh\" moment when I read about it afterwards and realized this was a film written and directed by the same guy.\n\nI also enjoyed how the visuals tuned with the narration. There was this point when he says something like, \"Have I lost my faith? No.\" While the camera is pointed at a (graffiti?) reading \"will god forgive us?\"\n\nThe way the final shot cuts so abruptly is absolutely beautiful. Also, I can't end this post without mentioning the synchronous breathing scene. When they start floating, I felt full-blown frisson. It was mesmerizing. I'm so glad they postponed the kiss scene to the end. I also feel that Amanda Seyfried's character knew Hawke was up to something, hence why she showed up.",

        "text": "There are a lot of aspects that make a good horror movie effective, but more often than not the genre is saturated with cheap tactics to initiate a jump scare with quick cuts and scary music. This is not to say that this element was missing from Ari Aster's Hereditary, it is something that he was able to transcend from the separation of lenses from which we view things of a paranormal nature. This division of lenses/perspectives of viewership engulfs the viewer in an existential dread of psychosis, religious guilt, and repressed trauma.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe use of Annie Graham's profession in model-making, and the very first shot which hints a distorted universe that exists within these models, both act to create the first division of viewership: the difference between real life and that which is taking place within the models. Even in many of the exterior shots of them home, there is a mixture of model work and real world to further blur this separation. It is nearly impossible for the viewer to understand whether the events taking place are within a model set or not, as the sets are constructed at times to appear as though they are blown-up miniatures.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe second division in viewership is the notion of Annie's psychosis versus the threats of the spiritual realm. These overlap at several points in the film, and her 'sleepwalking condition,' and inability to take accountability for anything she does creates a dual truth of psychosis and possession, blurring the lines between a real medical phenomenon and fabled encounters of the paranormal. \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe third division of viewership occurs in Annie's isolation after the death of Charlie, causing her to remove herself farther from reality, and further into her model work. When confronted by her husband, Steve, about building a model that depicted Charlie's death, she said it was a (paraphrased) \"true recalling of the events,\" as her quest for understanding and dissecting the trauma that clouded her life lies in contacting Charlie using a seance. Her inability to deal with her own trauma creates a multitude of realities and a division of herself as a person.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWith these factors at play, the terrifying imagery presented in the film presents a more realistic threat to the characters we've grown attached to, and seems to find a way to creep into our minds after the film is over. This movie is scary beyond belief, and is sure to spark a new interest in pensive horror.",

He doesn't even appear to be trying not to get hit when it suits him.\n\n2. He wins the match but an audience member shouts, 'Bum'. Unless she bet against him and even then, it doesn't seem like an insult for a winner - more for a loser that she knows is on the take\n\n3. The opponent, 'Spider' staggers off unconvincingly, suggesting it's all for show.\n\n4. He shares the locker room quite comfortably with 'Spider' after his opponent headbutted him and Rocky hit him while he was down. After such a dirty fight should there not be more animosity?\n\n5. The fixer pays them both in front of one another and as winner, Rocky's take is larger: no attempt at discretion, no eyelids batted.\n\n6. We see later Rocky works as muscle and debt collector for a loan shark to pay the bills: he's already a grey-market guy.\n\n6. His own boxing gym coach chides him for having no real ambition/drive. Fixing seems like it would suit a guy like that.\n\nCouldn't find anything on the net but do you think the script was trying to convey that Easter egg?",

        "text": "If ever a film genre sounds unappealing even in description, it’s the rape-revenge movie. It’s one of the most frequently derided sub-genres of horror cinema, tossed aside as a misogynistic avatar of the sadistic urges that are said to lurk within the dark hearts of scary movies. Regardless of the landmark work of film scholar Carol Clover in her seminal book Men, Women and Chainsaws, many still perceive the rape-revenge movie to be the lowest of the low.\n\nIt’s into that grubby landscape that French debutant Coralie Fargeat strides purposefully with Revenge. Not only is Fargeat’s movie a compelling and gripping thrill ride, it serves as a critique of the male gaze and a clear evocation of the arguments Clover made in her book. It’s a film that encourages the audience to become complicit in an action of horrific violence against a woman, only to then bring them equally into the bosom of protagonist Jen (Matilda Lutz) as she hacks, slashes and shoots her way to revenge.\n\nSuch is the sophistication of Revenge that it deserves a closer reading, with reference to the work of Clover and to the movie’s position as a horror movie and a rape-revenge story that flips the script on a particular element of gendered filmmaking.\n\nI would really appreciate you having a read of my full article... http://www.thepopcornmuncher.com/2018/05/31/analysis-coralie-fargeat-revenge-deconstructs-male-gaze/\n\nI look forward to discussing this idea with you all, as I feel like this is one of the most interesting and compelling movies of 2018 so far.",

        "text": "(I wrote this on letterboxd, the link to the exact same thing here: [https://letterboxd.com/eamon13/film/eraserhead/1/](https://letterboxd.com/eamon13/film/eraserhead/1/) )\n\nSo. I watched this film for the first time on May 13th of this year, 2018.\n\nI had no idea what I had just watched. I had no opinion because I was so utterly flabbergasted. I had no idea if I loved it or hated it, I had no idea what I liked or didn't like about it.\n\nAll I knew was that I had to watch more films by the director.\n\nThe only engagement I had had with Mr. Lynch before was his amazing film Wild At Heart. I loved the blend of comedy and action and of course the amazing acting. I was entranced.\n\nI had always heard of Mr. Lynch and that his films were good. I wanted to go in the order the films were made in, and that's why Eraserhead was my second of Mr. Lynch's films. I had actually attempted to watch Eraserhead in the past, but due to issues with my DVD player I did not.\n\nFast forward to a little later. I knew I had to watch more of Mr. Lynch's films. I knew I had to explore him. So I re\\-rented Eraserhead.\n\nI was watching it with a friend of mine who is VERY ADHD, and the entire time he was talking about how weird it was. I was also confused, but was quiet about it. I wanted to take it all in. I blocked my friend out and watched the show.\n\nLike I said, when it was done I had no opinion at all.\n\nFast forward to May 29th of the same year. I watch Mr. Lynch's next film, The Elephant Man. Besides a few scenes that I really enjoyed, I was again just plain confused. Not by the story or anything like that, I understood the story of both Eraserhead and The Elephant Man relatively well. I had no idea what I was being confused by.\n\nFast forward once again, and for the last time, to June 1st, for the same year. I watch the amazing film Mulholland Drive.\n\nI know that Mulholland Drive is not the next film Mr. Lynch made. I wanted to watch it because I knew absolutely nothing about it and I LOVE Naomi Watts.\n\nMulholland Drive blew me away entirely.\n\nIt is the closest film I have found that is at all similar in tone to one of my all time favorites Donnie Darko.\n\nBut, ironically, the thing that Mulholland Drive did the most, was make me finally understand the direction of Mr. Lynch. The entirety of Mulholland Drive you can feel the director purely doing what they wanted to. I don't mean that in a bad way or that it took away from the experience. It didn't. It enhanced it.\n\nI realized that what I was being confused by with Eraserhead and The Elephant Man was the direction. I had never experienced direction like the direction in those two films.\n\nMulholland Drive made me love Mr. Lynch's style.\n\nAnd, in turn, Eraserhead.\n\nMulholland Drive has turned Eraserhead into one of my favorite movies of all time. I love every bit of it. I know that might sound odd because I watched it a while ago at the time of this review (June 6th, 2018), but I don't care. I truly love Eraserhead.\n\nI am going to re\\-watch it on Saturday.\n\n(end of letterboxd review)\n\nI know a lot of people love this movie, but I am curious as to what people think of it. Please say your opinions, as I am genuinely interested if other people at least sort of agree with mine.",

        "text": " I love music. Even though I do not have talent to produce or reprodue it, I like studying it and it's one of my favorite types of art, and it gets even better when it's mixed with other types of art. The question I raised up in the title came up while I was watching Naruto and noticed that I liked nearly every character theme song and wondered why.\n\n Then I determined that, not counting the fact that they're really well composed and instrumental (type of music I love), they're vital for the storytelling of the characters. Orochimaru's theme is bone\\-chilling and organ based, which fits very well with the scary and intimidating persona he has (or at least used to have), Gaara's theme is full of madness and blood thirst feels that suits his character early in the series, Sasori's theme is pure loneliness and the themes for Madara/Pain are both imposing and glorious, which also suits perfectly to their characters.\n\n That's what, in my opinion, makes a theme song great, not only for characters, but for entire artworks as well, the fact that they can tell you all you need to know about them even before the plot starts developing. Halloween's theme sounds mysterious and is also minimalist, a double combo for a music that is supposed to represent the identity of a horror fillm made with an extrememely low budget. Jaws' theme is incresingly terrifying and also gives kind of a \"primitive\" vibe which is pretty fitting for an animal killer. The song does not even have to be an original track, the Evil Morty theme song for example is highly melancholical, cold and even calming at some points, and it's not only a good song but also a track that's impactfull and memorable, that caused a specially unique effect when it ended up the episode 7 of season 3.\n\n Since I'm not a musician, I cannot say it for sure why some songs causes some emotions with their rythim and/or composition, but if you are, please share your knowledge. My opinion is that a memorable theme song is almost always strongly attached to the storytelling , being capable of defining the basics characteristics of the character, persona or artwork throughout the sound. What about your opinion?",

We’ve all seen Disney’s version of the tale, released way back in 1951, and Tim Burton’s kind of psychedelic treatment from 2010. Nevertheless, few people know or have seen the 1988 version directed by czech surrealist animator Jan Svankmajer. I’ve been a fan of Svankmajer’s work for some time, and recently we had the chance to watch and discuss this, his first feature, at the university.\n\nLike I said, we all know the story: Alice, a very young girl, follows a white rabbit with very human characteristics down a rabbit hole, and she comes out on the other end in a place full of wonder, magic and unconventional creatures. Very much like the two Disney versions of the book. However, there’s where the similarities stop. While Disney’s movie is glee and colourful, Svankmajer’s film is creepy and disturbing. Employing stop-motion animation, the creatures are stuffed animals and/or marionettes that seem to be falling apart, shot through close ups that create a sense of closeness towards them that makes it all the more disturbing. The white rabbit, the march hare and the mad hatter aren’t the cheerful caricatures of Disney’s film, but worn out dolls and taxidermic material, whose mere sight makes it clear that this isn’t aimed for children. And in a twist that I found quite clever, the king and queen of hearts are cut out of playing cards.\n \nFull review at: https://breakingthefourthwallsite.wordpress.com/2018/06/05/svankmajers-alice-a-nightmarish-wonderland/ ",

It traps you with this apparently incoherent character who is hard getting behind of, but it always does it trying to see how much can you take as a viewer, toying with what we usually see as \"normal\" or conventional. \n\nAnother excellent masterpiece that does this is the movie Happiness, by Todd Solondz. \n\nThank you very much!",

        "text": "I've been trying to catch up on Stanley Kubrick's filmography for quite some time, so this year I decided to watch almost all of his filmography in order of release, with the exception of *Spartacus*, *Lolita* and the ones released before *The Killing*. This one I found to be pretty entertaining, although highly overwritten. However, the following three movies I saw of Kubrick (*Paths of Glory*, *Dr. Strangelove* and *2001: A Space Odyssey*) got a pretty strong emotional reaction from me. \n\n*Paths of Glory* made me feel angry and revolted against the injustice perpetrated against the french soldiers by their own superiors, all due to their self-centered and disgusting sense of bravado. *Dr. Strangelove* was almost like a film-adaptation of a newspaper satirical cartoon released during the Cold War, and it had me in stitches during its entire runtime. And I probably never felt such a varied mix of emotions and thoughts while watching a movie, as I did with *2001: A Space Odyssey*. \n\nSo, this weekend I decided to move to the next film of his on my list, which was *A Clockwork Orange* and, it is fair to say, I was quite excited to finally see it. \n\nI found the movie to be downright bonkers. Witnessing such craziness coming from the hands of milk-drinking young adults, who in turn speak with the eloquence of an eighteenth century British aristocrat, was fairly entertaining. However, while and after watching it, I just felt empty. There was practically nothing in the movie that gripped me in an emotional way. I was never invested in the narrative, or the characters, or even the world. The film gave me a lot of food for thought, but it overall felt soulless and too mechanical. The violence never felt violent enough; The more psychedelic and trippy elements of the film never hit home with me; The turmoil Alex goes through didn't really affect me in any sort way.  But what annoys me the most is that it is clearly trying to make me feel something. And I just can't give it that because I feel it didn't earn it.\n\nI mean, maybe that was what Kubrick was aiming for with this film: to create an emotional void in the viewer, mirroring the one the main character initially feels. But I'm not really sure.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Did any of you feel the same as I did when watching A Clockwork Orange for the first time?\n\nAlso, this is my first post here, so if you think I could work on some of my vocabulary or improve on something, please let me know. \n",

It feel so perfectly shot, cleanly edited, well-timed; I just love the way Gary Cooper fits into his character Will Kane, and I get more and more attached to him the more and more everyone abandons him.\n\nThe last few minutes of gun fighting feel very real. For the most part Kane is on the run and yet he fights back without any trace of cowardice. In contrast to another great Western The Searchers, where the heroes are the pursuers, the hero is the hunted one. I think that works very well; it also feels more satisfying to see his defeat of the bad guys in the final moments.\n\nYet there's a real bittersweet thing going on here. Helen Ramirez is gone from the town, never to return. The town is full of corrupt and cowardly people. Only the young boy who was eager to aid Kane but was turned down gets a smile from Kane at the end of the movie. And Will Kane's wife had to abandon her Quaker pacifism to save her husband. Nothing comes easy here.\n\n\"Do Not Forsake Me Oh My Darling\" felt a bit tacky at first, but I took a liking to it.\n\nEverything feels stripped down, meat-and-potatoes, and I think it surprised a lot of American moviegoers when they first saw it in 1952. Now it feels less strange, but it still feels \"other\" compared to the great Westerns of John Ford or Howard Hawks, or even the Sergio Leone spaghetti Westerns.\n\nI think this is one of my favorite 1950s films, alongside The Big Heat, The Searchers, The Ten Commandments, Seven Samurai, and Ben-Hur. Say what you will about the puritanism of the American 1950s era, but it was a really fertile period for American movies and even for other non-American movies.",

Though in its first two appearances it is vertical, in its third and final appearance, the monolith is horizontal, much like a movie screen. Not to mention, the real opening shot is of a black screen, with the theme by Ligetti playing, which is only ever heard when the monolith is present. So basically the opening shot is of the monolith, but it perfectly fills the screen, so it looks like there is nothing there.\n\nIn this sense, the monolith works as a mirror, reflecting the image of the viewer and the act of viewing back at them from its very opening. Many films play with this idea, such as Mean Streets, which uses a shot into a film projector early in the movie, or Amour, which presents an image of the audience of a piano recital as its second shot, and the countless movies that open with shots of eyes \\(I'm looking at you Un Chien Andalou\\), but no film executes this as audaciously as 2001. I just wish I know which critic I read that initial theory from, cause I don't think I came up with it.",

I had just recently seen the Hobbit and *hated* it. I didn't really know why, but I did. I couldn't articulate why I hated it, but I knew that I did. I knew that it didn't entertain me or get me emotionally invested, but I had no clue *why* it failed to do this. His video not only put into words what I was thinking, but helped me understand my own thoughts.\n\nSince then, I've completely fallen in love with video essay channels, and, more importantly, figuring out why I like things *without* the help of video essays. It's great to have people explain to you why you like things you like when before you might not have understood, but it's something else entirely to figure it out on your own.\n\nI want to go beyond video essay understanding though. It's one thing to watch a 10 minute video on Miyazaki, and another to read a [150 page essay on him](https://scholar.colorado.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1921&amp;context=honr_theses). In a lot of ways it pains me to say, but I'd *never* be able to write something like that... not without studying and writing more, that is. And that's what I want to do. I already know I like writing non-fiction, I've written numerous political pamphlets and loved the experience. I want to be able to do that for the movies (and, really, TV shows too) I love.\n\nThe big problem for me is I don't know what to do. I'd love to do that kind of thing for a living, but how do I go about doing that? I don't think this is really the right sub-reddit for this, but people *have* asked similar questions before, so I hope it's alright. I understand that, like all humanities, it probably won't be \"easy\" in the job market. I'm really interested in being told that kind of thing; it'll be like that all the other stuff I'm interested in any way.\n\nThank you :)",

For the most part, it's basically just been seen by general audiences as \"just another Disney movie\", it hasn't really been talked about with the classics of the Disney Renaissance or the Walt-era films. At the box office, it's sandwiched between Frozen and The Lion King yet those films felt way more like phenomenon's than Zootopia did, as far as the United States is concerned.\n\nThe only thing people seemed to actually be talking about regarding this movie is the anti-bigotry/prejudice message the movie had. And, while that is an important message, especially nowadays, I can't believe a movie that had such high critical and BO numbers could be loved just for the message alone. Yet, outside of furries and the fandom on /r/Zootopia, that seems to be the only thing that most people cared about. But there's got to be something else people liked about it.\n\nSo tell me, personally, if you did like Zootopia, what did you like about it other than that it had a good message? I'd love to know.",

        "text": "First I want to say, I enjoyed the movie *mother!* from a general filmmaking perspective. The irritating social nuances exaggerated to the extreme (often to comical effect), the well-captured paranoid feeling of one's invasion of privacy, and the eventual climax into the \"fever dream\" sequence was incredible visually and a great technical achievement. Aronofsky's biggest strength is his expression of tension and anxiety in film and this was him completely letting loose and having fun with it.\n\nI'm probably in a small minority of people who actually enjoyed the film in this manner but my place of criticism lies in what audiences take away from the film afterwards. I felt the message the film was attempting to promote in terms of religion and God was incredibly misguided and even purposely distorted.\n\nI did not realize this until a few days after watching the film, but something just felt very off with the way God was portrayed. He is shown as a man who behaves \"nice\" but in reality is manipulative, pathetically narcissistic, and passive-aggressive in the most petty way imaginable. I suspect this is Aronofsky's outsider view of Christians or religious people in general. At one moment, he seems to satirize the \"fanatical\" Italians in reference to how they may behave towards the Pope in the vatican. He also subscribes to the juvenile accusation that \"Catholics are cannibals\" in reference to communion and I doubt he has put any effort in understanding the context of it.\n\nAt the same time, a part of me can find a bit of dark humor in watching those people feverishly devour a baby Jesus but I can't help thinking how painfully reductionist and perhaps bitter Aronofsky's views are. At the climax, the mother's heart finally turns to black and she starts killing the religious fanatics one by one. This is most likely a revenge sequence the audience is intended to enjoy since the entire story before this was spent investing our sympathy towards the mother while simultaneously developing a hatred for the people around her. It makes me wonder what exactly Aronofsky wants us to get out of this film.\n\nI don't mean to diagnose Aronofsky, but the sentiments expressed in this film reflect the prime anti-social archetype of someone who hates people and God but feels sympathy towards the environment or whatever he deems is innocent. To put it jokingly, he is being the \"redditor intellectual\" to the max.\n\nHe has the right to express his views, but I feel it is distasteful and lazy to portray religions and God in film in such a simplistic manner without being willing to have any level of depth in understanding them. It is similar to someone reducing the entirety of Islam to jihadist terrorists and violent homophobia/sexism. He uses biblical stories for narrative purposes but fails to comprehend the moral context of those stories(perhaps even willingly). This was a problem with his film *Noah* as well. The narrative is simply a narrative and nothing more which is probably why he portrays God as a flawed human writer.\n\nHe also seems to fall for the common assumption that Christianity interprets God as some kind of cartoon-like image. The actual interpretation is much more complicated and more in line with nature which seems to be understood better with directors such as Scorsese on *Silence* or Terrence Malick on *The Tree of Life* and *To the Wonder*.\n\nAronofsky is an extremely talented director but his storytelling is often filled with gross misrepresentations and an underdeveloped world view which may contribute to the lack of depth one may feel while watching his last two films despite them being \"complicated\" or having a lot going on.

        "text": "Full Metal Jacket — The Duality of Man\\\\\n\nVideo Form: [https://youtu.be/jsvzkOvWAKQ](https://youtu.be/jsvzkOvWAKQ)\n\nSince its release in 1987, Full Metal Jacket has remained a topic of discussion among film lovers. The film is notably divided into two parts, the first being at boot camp and the second in Vietnam. But what’s most interesting about this Kubrick masterpiece is that it’s not a Vietnam war film. Actually, it isn’t a war film at all.\n\nThe war could be substituted with pretty much anything else and the ideas would continue to be relevant. The movie is essentially an exposition of the loss of individuality and dehumanisation that catapults the troops into becoming killing machines. So, it makes sense that Kubrick used the US Marine Corps involvement in Vietnam to teach us that in such situations, the individual doesn’t matter. The individual becomes a cog in a machine, only a part of a system.\n\nPart 1: Basic Training \n\nThe melody of Hello Vietnam playing during the opening scene subtly introduces us to the death of individuality that will define the soldiers journey throughout the rest of the film. This is the best introduction we are given. Actually, we get nothing from these people. No name, no age...nothing. The only sense of individuality they’re given are the nicknames Drill Instructor Hartman gives them.\n\nR. Lee Ermey’s monologues have the intention to dehumanize the young recruits in every way possible so they won’t hesitate to kill when the time comes. By far, the brutal Drill Instructor is the most entertaining character in the film and his absence in the second half is one of the main reasons why people like the first half more. It usually takes multiple viewings of Full Metal Jacket to properly grasp the significance of the second half. As a first time viewer, it may seem that during the second half of the movie, it simply “falls apart”. While comedic at first, the Drill Instructor’s abuse and humiliation eventually get to a point of questioning one’s self dignity and self worth. The first half of the film is relatively easy to identify with, since pretty much anyone can sympathize with the intense abuse and targeting that Pyle suffers. Hartman wants to make his recruits like him: hard and cold. **“If you survive recruit training...you will be a weapon, you will be a minister of death praying for war. But until that day… you are the lowest form of life on this Earth! You are not even human fucking beings!”**\n\nLeonard \\(A.K.A. Gomer Pyle\\) is the worst recruit of the bunch. He struggles to make it through the system. After weeks of abuse from Hartman and his fellow Privates, he does become the D.I.’s perfect killing machine, completely dehumanized. Unexpectedly, it’s Leonard that becomes better programmed to kill the enemy, even more so than Joker, Cowboy or anyone else. Ironically, the D.I. becomes a victim of his greatest success.\n\nThe audience’s attention is focused on the relationship between Hartman and Pyle. However, to fully understand Pyle’s actions by the end of the Parris Island act, we have to pay attention to Joker. It becomes clear that he’s the only character who keeps a small measure of individuality. There’s a sarcastastic, intelligent cynicism about him that distances him from becoming the ultimate Marine as Hartman wants him to become. “Is that you John Wayne? Is this me?” Here, he’s poking fun at the archetype of the American soldier and the cliched conduct of the dominant male. Joker is attacked by Hartman during a scene in which he says he doesn’t believe in the Virgin Mary. “Sir, the private believes that any answer he gives will be wrong and the senior drill instructor will beat him harder if he reverses himself, sir.” As a reaction to this, Hartman makes Joker squad leader, which is perhaps a crucial flaw made by the drill instructor. Instead of getting rid of Joker’s individuality, he allows him to maintain it and this begins to influence Pyle.\n\nHartman’s ultimate mission is to destroy Pyle’s individuality so he can become just another cog in the system. But something goes wrong in his transformation. Pyle is well on track to becoming the ultimate marine: Animal Mother. Both characters are even alike in some ways: They both have similar black hair, the false grin and their eyes are constantly half open. Animal Mother’s helmet  even has the quote “I am become death” written on it. He’s the ideal marine Hartman tried to make out of Pyle.\n\nPyle definitely got close though, becoming precise and meticulous. He could quickly dismantle and reassemble his M\\-14 and becomes a skillful shooter, even receiving praise from Hartman himself. However, Pyle was shaped by not one, but two characters: Hartman and Joker. Joker mentors Pyle through all his daily activities, but unlike Hartman, he uses his intellect and charismatic personality to help him. By the end of the first act, Pyle’s new mentality has been mixed with Joker’s humanity and Hartman’s ideals. He’s stuck with a duality that can only be explained through a close look at Joker in the second act of the film.\n\nPart 2: Vietnam\n\nJoker suffers from “the Jungian thing, sir.”. He maintains his individuality, but also has the killer instincts Hartman instilled in him. In Vietnam he wears a peace symbol, but at the same time has “Born to Kill” written on his helmet. This duality impacts Pyle at the end of the first act in the sense that, like Joker, acts as an individual with the small amount of humanity left in him. Unfortunately, the only act of humanity known to him is the only one not frowned upon by Hartman: killing.\n\nThe Vietnam Act exposes Joker’s duality, which is what makes it interesting and worth watching. When he attempts to kill the sniper, he fails as Hartman warned him during Basic Training. “If your killer instincts are not clean and strong you will hesitate at the moment of truth. You will not kill.” One of the soldiers saves him from a sure death and as the Marines circle around the sniper, what’s just gone down hits Joker. He must now shoot a woman and a child, something that repulsed him earlier in the film. Like Pyle, Joker destroys a part of his humanity by shooting the sniper. As Joker looks up and the other soldiers congratulate him, he realizes that he just lost an innocence, a part of himself that he will never retrieve. From the opening scene to now, we experience Joker’s transformation from a sarcastic comedian, to the killer Hartman wanted him to become. Re\\-born to kill. Perhaps the biggest irony in the entire film comes in the end with the soldiers, programmed to kill, singing a song about a children’s cartoon. All innocence is now lost.\n\nVideo Form: [https://youtu.be/jsvzkOvWAKQ](https://youtu.be/jsvzkOvWAKQ)",

Having just seen it again yesterday, I'd like to know what people think is the significance of the puppy that Shane buys as he's descending further into madness. I can't figure out how it fits into the movie, narratively or thematically. What are your theories?\n\nI'll take this opportunity to register two minor complaints (nitpicks, really) about the movie, specifically its special effects:\n\n- Those CGI flames when the house catches on fire look really bad.\n\n- The fake semen looks ridiculous. Shane would have had to jizz about a gallon of a substance that doesn't look like semen at all. You'd think the prop department  wouldn't have trouble with simple stuff like that.",

There are the “Surveillance Cam” filmmakers (Abbas Kiarostami), who emphasize capturing day-to-day reality. There is “Art Gallery,” cinema which is a move toward pure imagery: light and color, which can manifest itself in films that are abstract, or dream-like (Lynch). And the third direction is what Schrader refers to as Mandala, or “meditation” cinema, films that work on the viewer almost like a trance (Ozu). “I laid out this cosmogony of where all these directors were after breaking free from the nucleus of narrative and they’re electrons shooting off in these three directions,” said Schrader. \n\n&gt; “I also drew what I called the [Andrei] ‘Tarkovsky Ring.’ What happens when an artist goes through the ‘Tarkovsky Ring,’ that’s the point where he is no longer making cinema for a paying audience. He’s making it for institutions, for museums, and so forth.”",

After a few AAA movies with 60 fps I bet it'd be the norm - and a much better experience!\n\nI had this train of thought after I read about how the director of Mad Max slowed down the frame rate below 24 fps to make things easier to understand, and this seems to be an effect of not having 60 fps footage, and delivering more information to the viewer in the same time slot.\n\nAnyhow, what do y'all think?",

        "text": "I think that Star Wars fans \\(which I am one\\) are so focused on the legacy of Star Wars and how the new movies relate to the original trilogy that they overlook the actual filmmaking on display. In my opinion every film should be evaluated on its own merit and so I tried to disregard the history of Star Wars while watching the new installments, here are my thoughts:\n\nI thought that The Force Awakens was a perfect update to the Star Wars universe. In the original trilogy and basically any good adventure movie, I believe that the most important aspect is the characters. The Force Awakens introduces new characters \\(Rey, Finn, Kylo Ren, and Poe\\) that I cared about immediately as we learn about them by their actions and circumstances. It's a great example of \"show don't tell\" and the way the characters are set up help us have more empathy for them. All the actors absolutely nail their roles, including Harrison Ford who fits in perfectly. I think that viewers who had never seen the original trilogy can totally appreciate the Han Solo character just based on his presence in TFA. The action scenes are extremely well made but only work so much because we care about characters involved. Rey and Finn had fantastic chemistry and backgrounds, Poe was so much fun to watch and Kylo Ren was a really fascinating villain that was not an unstoppable force but deeply conflicted and flawed. Some of the heroic characters may not be so complex but we feel like we are on this journey with them especially as they begin to get in way in over their heads. The cinematography of the film is fantastic as every scene is visually interesting and J.J Abrams creates many jaw\\-dropping moments. The dialogue is also great and for me every joke or emotional moment his its mark. Most of all I felt the movie just had the right feeling or \"magic\" of fun, excitement and wonder that made the original Star Wars movies so good. But at the same time I think it would be just as good if it wasn't a Star Wars movie and actually it might have been more appreciated if that were the case. \n\nThe biggest critique of The Force Awakens that I have seen is that is played it too safe by basically redoing the first Star Wars movie and I can agree that there are several elements that are quite similar. I believe that J.J Abrams didn't focus so much on the similarities with the original film and just set out to make the best film he could, and because it is the first in a Star Wars trilogy it happened to bring back some aspects of the first film. What I don't understand is why this makes TFA a bad film? Tons of movies since the late 1970s ripped off elements of Star Wars but barely any were as compelling as TFA. Overall, I'm very happy that J.J Abrams will be returning to make Episode 9 and I hope it retain the same tone and feeling as TFA.\n\nNow I thought The Last Jedi was also a very good movie but kind of a disappointment after TFA. Again, my main concern is the filmmaking and whether the movie can stand on its own. While I believe J.J Abrams was primarily focused on making an entertaining movie, I think Rian Johnson was fixated on how TLJ would tie into the Star Wars universe. it seemed he tried so hard to make a film that flipped our expectations after TFA was criticized for being safe, and in doing so neglected the more important goal of making the movie fun. I had no problem with the direction the movie took but I thought Johnson really wanted to push these themes that uprooted the legacy of Star Wars that he began hitting us over the head with \"deep\" statements about hope and failure which just became too obvious after a while. Now don't get me wrong, everything involving Rey, Kylo Ren, and Luke Skywalker was excellent, especially the connection developed between Rey and Kylo. However, I found it difficult to care about the other characters which was really disappointing after the promise of the first movie. I thought Finn was especially bad as he was put into a meaningless side story and became very overdramatic and emotional in nearly all of his scenes while not developing the character at all. None of the new characters added much and to me the biggest drop off from the first film was the dialogue which became pretty boring in many scenes and tried so hard to push the themes that it took away from the charm of the characters. Unlike TFA the jokes really didn't land this time and felt like it was trying to inject humor into a much more serious story instead of letting it come out naturally. I definitely didn't hate TLJ but In thought it had some very high \"highs\" but also a lot of \"lows\" which made it really frustrating.\n\nJust to add I thought both films were drastically better that \"The Star Wars Stories\" Rogue One and Solo which I thought were entirely meaningless and had extremely bland and boring characters; the opposite of what made Star Wars so good to begin with. Anyway what are your thoughts on the new Star Wars films?",

        "text": "(Hopefully this makes sense I'm not always the most articulate person)\n\nMaybe I've been looking in the wrong places but I have never seen any discussion of how creepy and almost empty seeming Jeffrey is for most of the film despite being the protagonist. \n\nHe seems to have almost no personality whatsoever and only acts how others expect him to. This explains the shock and horror when Sandy realises he's been doing things she didn't expect, despite only knowing him for a short time or, in other words, not long enough to really know a person. His parents barely appearing and not much time being spent in his house adds to this sense of him having no self or background. He is a blank slate.\n\nCompare this with Frank, who displays his emotions openly and expressively (as shown by the Suave Ben singing scene.) He seems more \"real\" than Jeffrey. He is more like a real person, even if that person is awful.\n\nJeffrey does come 'out of his shell' temporarily in his interactions with Dorothy. They both appear much more comfortable with each other than him and Sandy. I think that Jeffrey escapes his repressed state in scenes like the sex scene in which he is provoked into hitting her, but she enjoys it. If he could let go of the guilt of the action this could be an example of a positive type of 'finding yourself' (a concept Lynch has talked about and has interest in) to contrast with Frank's negative type (in which he presumably realised he is evil.)\n\nAll of this puts the ending in a much more negative light as it suggests that Jeffrey is returning to repressing his emotions rather than returning to normalacy.\n\nThe question I was left with at the end was \"Is it better to find yourself, and risk that self being evil, or to stay repressed?\"\n\nEdit: I just realised this could also be seen as a twist on Todorov's narrative structure where the change is positive and the equilibriums are negative",

I'm doing a bit of research and looking for writings on groups of films that are linked by content / ideas / etc.  After bit of digging all I'm really finding are the usual top 100 lists, or lists of films that are XYZ. \n\nAs an example, it could be a group of films that are post-apocalyptic. Sure, great - but post what kind of apocalyptic? Are we talking aliens, robots, war? I'd like to drill down further than the surface of general themes. \n\nThis link I'm looking for could also be something that isn't in the films per see - such as films linked by influence, technical mastery, or in response to world events or other films. For example, Soderbergh re-edited four films he didn't make. This is exactly the type of thing I'm looking for. \n\nAny places I should be looking that I'm unaware of? \n\n\nThanks. ",

        "text": "Saw Phantom Thread today. I feel there are so many ideas packed in this one, some of them variations from those in older PTA films. Siblings relationship, placed in a different context here, is a bit familiar from Punch Drunk Love. Yin and Yang of the leads reminded me of The Master and to a certain degree of There Will Be Blood. Artist and muse arc sets up the narrative but PTA turns tables on this with the relationship dynamic. Reynolds likes to be in control but he is submissive to Alma when he’s sick and vulnerable. She nurses him back to strength which drives his artistry (he feels hungry). He’s in control again. Until she realizes she is losing his attention. Artist and muse. Man and woman. Control and attention. It’s cyclical. Add: Reynolds longing for his mother and his sister who knows him better than anyone else. These are almost like plot devices. And I didn’t even start on the camera, production design and music. This is very subtle from PTA and as a result Phantom Thread becomes a less visceral more softer companion piece to The Master. \n\nWas anyone else reminded of Barry Lyndon on cinematography? Particularly those low light interior scenes with Alma in the chair and the aesthetic of cinematography in general, interiors especially. And the arguments between Reynolds and Alma were almost like lesser psychotic variations of those between the leads of Scenes from a Marriage. On an other tangent: Bibi Andersson’ character, a nurse, is called Alma in Persona. For some reason, I had a flash of a couple of scenes from Nuri Bilge Ceylan’s Climates as well. ",

        "text": "Pather Panchali is a movie that remains not just personally beloved but also, has been a movie that has been appreciated across the world since it first came out. One of the reasons it has been so universally adored is because it presents an intricate study of the human which transcends time and boundaries.\nOne of its most endearing qualities is the depiction of childhood in the midst of the harshness of adult realities.  Ray also posits Apu as an observer of the brutalities of adult life. This he does through the close-ups of the young actor’s face as he observes the daily cruelty that surrounds his impoverished life. \n\nOne of the most beloved scenes, that is constantly talked about, is the train sequence. It is the epitome of childhood curiosity and wonder that lies at the heart of the movie. The long sequence with almost no dialogue masterfully documents the awe that the children feel as they encounter a wider world that that had hitherto existed only in the periphery of their knowledge, in the distant whistling of the passing train heard from their house. By shifting the camera from the children to focus on the train and the lingering smoke it leaves behind, Ray makes the audience a part of the wonder felt by the children. This train sequence has captivated other brilliant filmmakers like Scorsese, who recalls the scene in distinctly even though he had watched the film in high school (qted. in Mazumder, thequint.com). Wes Anderson would pay a tribute to the scene in his movie The Darjeeling Limited (Roisin, indiewire.com). \n\nWhen Pather Panchali first opened in Indian cinemas it soon became a favourite among the Bengali audience. After all, there was something quintessentially Bengali in the story, especially in its depiction of Durga Pujo and Jatra theatricals. However, while culturally it is a movie entrenched in Bengal, emotionally it transcends boundaries. Its depiction of innocence, joy, suffering, and hardships are something that can be fathomed without any cultural context. It is this universality of emotions that joins people together across time, culture and space in their appreciation of the movie. \n\n[Click here if you want a more in-depth analysis of the movie](https://www.desicinephiles.com/editors-pick/pather-panchali-looking-into-the-movie-that-introduced-the-genius-of-satyajit-ray-to-the-world)",

Again thank you for taking time to read this, it is took a lot of hard work.  *A\\*\\*gain I can't stress the link enough\\(this is a long read, pics help break it up.\\)*[https://thefilmera.com/2018/06/01/film\\-frame\\-friday\\-speed\\-racer\\-go/](https://thefilmera.com/2018/06/01/film-frame-friday-speed-racer-go/)\n\n## Looking Through Speed Racer's Kaleidoscopic Lens \n\nTen years ago, the Wachowskis released their first directorial effort since having completed their *Matrix* trilogy. Long\\-gestating at Warner Bros. \\(all the way to the early 90s\\), the film had stalled at the studio multiple times. Essentially, WB struggled to bring the venerable 1960’s anime TV show *Speed Racer* to the big screen. In 2006, the Wachowskis were brought on board to write and direct their own take on\\* the materi\\*al. Speed Racer tells the adventures of the eponymous Speed Racer and his family and friends, a plucky band of earnest go\\-getters who decide to take a stand against the evil mega\\-corporations of the world, using motorsport racing as their weapon of choice. The siblings were keen to do it\\*, as the Sp\\*eed Racer cartoon series was a childhood favorite of theirs. And WB was keen to have them do it, thinking they would produce a success on th\\*e vein of \\*The Matrix, except this time they would be casting a wider net in terms of public app\\*eal; Speed \\*Racer had always been meant as a family friendly project. Little did the studio know what the Wachowskis’ real intention was:\n\n[*Lana Wachowski*](https://www.buzzfeed.com/adambvary/the-wachowskis-jupiter-ascending-the-matrix-cloud-atlas)*: Warner Bros. was at first gleeful that we were, like, doing a known entity that seemed like a family movie for kids. And then we started showing stuff, and they were like, \"Oh my god. Oh my god.\" We were interested in cubism and Lichtenstein and pop art, and we wanted to bring all of that stuff into the cinema aesthetic. ...* ***They were like, \"Oh my god. Are you insane? What are you doing? This is the weirdest thing I've ever seen.\" And we're like, \"Yes, that's the reason we're making it.\"***\n\nWhile for WB *Speed Racer* was *just* going to be another four\\-quadrant tent\\-pole release at the box office, the Wachowskis had decided they were *also* going to use this property to push the boundaries of editing, cinematography and the normalcy of what the “cinema aesthetic” is supposed to be.\n\n[*Lana Wachowski*](https://uproxx.com/hitfix/an-epic-interview-with-the-wachowskis-and-tom-tykwer-from-cloud-atlas-to-jupiter-ascending/)*:  We said, ‘Okay, we are going to assault every single modern aesthetic with this film.’*\n\n## \n\n## Layers Upon Layers Upon Layers\n\n*Speed Racer* starts off with a literal, visual representation of a kaleidoscope, an instrument that presents ever\\-changing viewpoints and colors. It lets you know exactly what you are in for from its first moments.\n\nWhile this seems like a fairly innocuous opening title sequence, **this is actually an early look at the film’s multi\\-layered editing technique**, in which multiple disparate elements are layered on top of each other, transitioning, appearing and disappearing at the directors’ will. The Wachowskis’ intention was to create a continuous visual flow in the narrative, straying away from the more traditional cut.\n\n[*Lana Wachowski*](https://uproxx.com/hitfix/an-epic-interview-with-the-wachowskis-and-tom-tykwer-from-cloud-atlas-to-jupiter-ascending/)*: And we said, ‘Why do you have to use cuts?* ***We want to do sequences that are like run\\-on sentences, stream\\-of\\-consciousness sentences*** *that don’t just start and end with the conventional cut,* ***that are just montaged collages and flow the way...’***\n\nIn the opening sequence we get our first look at one of the film’s visual staples:\n\nWe see multiple characters, elements, and backgrounds entering and leaving the frame with each passing second. Similar to a kaleidoscope, we get multiple viewpoints from the race, narrated by four different commentators, one after another in a semi\\-continued motion. What could be an audiovisual cacophony is edited artfully in an easy to follow manner. While these are just racing commentators who add a little flair to the action, the same technique is used later in the film to greater narrative effect when main character Speed narrates memories from his childhood. Thanks to this layered approach we can see him on screen reacting to events from his past as they crisscross in the background, heightening the emotion of the scene.\n\nDuring one of the movie’s most expansive set\\-pieces, the Casa Cristo Rally race, we see how the Wachowskis’ idea of **a moving collage comes to life**. As the camera zooms out the scenery looks to be made of multiple flat 2D layers, one on top of each other, with everything flowing together in a continuous motion without any cuts.\n\n[*Lana Wachowski*](http://collider.com/andy-wachowski-lana-wachowski-cloud-atlas-speed-racer-interview/)*: And we thought wouldn’t it be amazing to create sequences in a film that are just rushing montages that simulate the way that we actually experience the world.  Particularly in like a race or a sports event where its swirling historical memory experience strategy conflict all woven without constructed, falsely constructed sentences.*\n\nThis effect is also put to great use in **the many creative transitions found in** ***Speed Racer.*** Here’s one example: during the Thunderhead race, Speed is so ahead of the pack that the only car in front of him is the video game\\-like replay ghost of the reigning lap record, set many years ago by his brother, Rex. To show us a flashback of Rex’s race, the film smoothly transitions from the present to the past in a single motion, dissolving one background layer into another, and using the stars in the night sky as an abstract marker for the time switch.\n\nWhen it’s time to return to the current timeline, Speed and his Mach 6 invade the flashback from behind and literally wash over the screen, as if the present time was a massive wave of color and scenery, covering the past.\n\nThis is all possible due to the fact that the film was shot almost entirely on green screen. All elements on screen were shot separately and then composited together. To construct the final image, the VFX teams created multiple 360\\-degree panoramas stitched together from photographs, 3D models and matte paintings, a sort of **virtual cinematography**. These panoramas would then be layered on top of each other in a way that resembled 2D animation to create the results shown above, [in what visual effects designer John Gaeta dubbed “**photo\\-anime.**”](https://web.archive.org/web/20080622161832/http://features.cgsociety.org/story_custom.php?story_id=4564&amp;page=2) It was a collaborative process between the visual effects artists, the editors and the directors.\n\n*“‘Speed Racer is the first movie I’ve worked on where* ***it seemed we had the potential to carve out a new format for a movie***\\*,” Gaeta says. “It’s a work in progress, of course. But we could let our hair down and break some conventions of cinematography.”\\**“You can see a thread through all the Wachowski projects and my collaborations in visual effects design through all these years,” he adds.* “Visual effects always serves stories; the glue of this work is in changing the perspective and perception of events in stories.\\*\\*\\*”\\*\\*\\*\n\n## \n\n## Poptimistic Art, Cubism and Anime\n\nAs mentioned earlier, at the time of *Speed Racer’s* production the Wachowskis were influenced by cubism and pop art, and they also wanted it to feel like a live\\-action cartoon. How are these elements brought together?\n\nOne of the film’s most striking features is its use of color, more specifically its use of primary colors and an **oversaturated** color palette. [According to John Knoll from Industrial Light &amp; Magic ](http://www.scene-stealers.com/blogs/6078/)\\(one of several VFX houses that worked on the film\\), he kept getting asked to push for more and more color saturation in the shots he was in charge of \\(such as during Racer X’s introduction\\) until eventually, he turned it all the way up.\n\nAt a time when visual effects strived for the utmost photorealism \\(and still do, although with varying degrees of success…\\), *Speed Racer* went in the opposite direction and did so not just with colors. The goal\\*\\* here was hyp\\*\\*er\\-reality, something that looks completely unreal, in order to capture in some measure the source genre \\(animation\\) and to present a unique\\-looking world. Even the way lighting reflects off the cars is done in a way that purposefully eschews realism.\n\nOften it resembles an animated CGI film with live actors rather than the other way around \\(a live\\-action film with CGI elements\\). In a way it’s a callback to old Disney features that mixed actors with animation, although *clearly* with some differences.\n\nThe film’s cheery disposition, in stark contrast to *The Matrix*’s grungy and darkly\\-lit cyberpunk aesthetic, [was called **poptimistic** by John Gaeta.](https://web.archive.org/web/20080622161832/http://features.cgsociety.org/story_custom.php?story_id=4564&amp;page=2)\n\n*“’Speed Racer’ is the antithesis of ‘The Matrix,’” Gaeta says. “It’s bright, colorful,* ***poptimistic***\\*. The whole frame of mind is different. We went a level away from photorealism and the perfect integration of all things.”\\*\n\nTo further contribute to the film’s otherworldly visuals and also as a way of paying homage to its source material, a few cues from **manga** iconography are also brought into *Speed Racer*, such as **speed lines**.\n\nDue to the nature of the static medium that is manga, speed lines are used to portray the direction of movement, and also to emphasize character motion.\n\nBut *Speed Racer* puts its own spin on it and uses speed lines not just to accentuate motion, but also to transition from one scene to another, and more:\n\nAfter contract negotiations go sour, villain Royalton, who has complete control over the results of motorsport racing, threatens Speed and his family with total ruin, accurately predicting that he won’t even finish his upcoming race, which the film then seamlessly transitions to afterward. Here speed lines are actually used for more than just motion and scene transitions. As the scenery swirls around Royalton, this motion accelerates in tandem with the background morphing into speed lines and the increasingly aggressive tone in his speech, resulting in the dramatic tension in the scene being bumped up a notch.\n\n**Abstract background effects** such as patterns are also used in manga and anime to emphasize the mood of a scene or state of mind of a character. *Speed Racer* uses shallow depth of field to play with the *bokeh* in the picture to achieve this effect. Bokeh is the aesthetic quality of the blur produced in the out\\-of\\-focus parts of an image produced by a lens.\n\nThere are also sections in the film where it goes even more abstract with its visuals, **using cubist\\-inspired abstract geometric shapes** in place of the actual, “real” scenery.\n\nIn a reference to the original show’s classic opening sequence, the bokeh in the background changes into a massive red and yellow checkerboard pattern, also serving as the checkered flag signaling Speed’s triumph in the Casa Cristo rally race.\n\n[*Lana Wachowski*](http://collider.com/andy-wachowski-lana-wachowski-cloud-atlas-speed-racer-interview/)*: Lens flair; all of these things can be redesigned to an aesthetic choice instead of connected to just what the technology can produce and then as we talked about all this, we had this moment that we were talking about cubism and the way that cubism offers this construction of art based on the imagination of perspective.*\n\nIn this scene we also see another technique that is widely used by the Wachowskis in *Speed Racer*, that being the **deep focus**. Deep focus is a photographic and cinematographic technique used to keep the entire image in focus.\n\nEvery element in the image is in focus, the foreground \\(Speed\\), the middle\\-ground \\(the Mach 5\\) and the scenery far into the background. By diminishing the depth in the picture, the sensation that you’re watching a 2D, traditionally animated movie is enhanced.\n\nAt points, the Wachowskis also use a form of **dynamic deep focus**.\n\nWatch how at the beginning of the shot a traditional depth of field is employed, the foreground \\(Pops Racer\\) is in focus and the background \\(Rex Racer\\) out of focus. However, as Rex walks into the picture and gains focus, Pops Racer doesn’t lose it, and the image transitions into being entirely in focus.\n\nBy mixing the strong, bold use of color in pop art, the abstraction and multiple viewpoints of cubism, the sensibilities of anime and manga, and their own multi\\-layered style, the Wachowskis have managed to create a film that looks wholly unique and truly stands out from the pack. *Speed Racer* doesn’t merely wear its influences on its sleeve; it deconstructs and reassembles them into something completely different, finalizing in a package that is entirely its own thing.\n\nIn this scene, right before the final Grand Prix sequence, we see the visuals of *Speed Racer* come together: the use of saturated primary colors, multiple elements layered on top of each other to provide simultaneous viewpoints, and a dynamic depth\\-of\\-field effect that starts with the picture being entirely in focus, but with each passing character the background starts becoming more and more out of focus until it dissolves into abstract geometric shapes.\n\n[Lana Wachowski](http://collider.com/andy-wachowski-lana-wachowski-cloud-atlas-speed-racer-interview/): And we’re like “wow, we could make the first cubist film because we could do edits that have the back of someone’s head and the front of their face on the screen at the same time.\"\n\n## \n\n## The Final Lap\n\n*Speed Racer* encountered divisiveness at the time of release. Some people couldn’t stomach its colorful, hyper\\-real aesthetic; others found the characters banal and superficial. On a personal note, it was one of my favorite movies of 2008, and over multiple viewings, it has become one of my favorite movies, flat out. I was lucky enough to be able to catch it in theaters \\(its run didn’t last long\\), where you’re truly able to appreciate its visual splendor. But as much as I love it for how it looks and the chances it takes aesthetically, it’s the characters that form the backbone of the movie for me. While some decried the earnest nature of the film, I thought it was refreshing to see a family of characters who are unabashedly *good* and show honest love and care\\* for one an\\*other. Speed Racer is a film without a single cynical cylinder in its engine; the emotions on display are as true as the visuals are crazy. For me, it’s a movie with real heart. When you see John Goodman and Emile Hirsch having a heartfelt father\\-to\\-son talk, you feel it. Without this expertly\\-constructed and\\* 100&amp;#37; s\\*incere family dynamic, all of its whizzing and zooming cinematography and flashing lights of color would be for naught. And yet I fully admit\\* that Speed\\* Racer is not for everyone; it absolutely is a love\\-it\\-or\\-hate\\-it kind of movie, and I’m fine with that.\n\n***That’s what art should be***\\*\\*.\\*\\*\n\nArt should challenge conventions and pre\\-conceived notions, and that’s naturally going to cause rejection in some. If a group of people hates it, then it’s doing a good job. There’s nothing worse than conformity and safeness, where you run the risk of being forgotten. Although *Speed Racer* didn’t do too hotly at the box office when it was released, over ten years it has seemingly been slowly finding new appreciation. For its 10\\-year anniversary, several positive retrospectives popped up from the likes of [Film Crit Hulk \\(via the Observer\\)](http://observer.com/2018/05/looking-back-at-the-wachowskis-2008-masterpiece-speed-racer/), [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/05/speed-racer-10-year-anniversary-wachowskis/560177/) and [CBR](https://www.cbr.com/speed-racer-box-office-bomb-cult-classic/).\n\nTen years ago, Lana and Lily Wachowski released a movie about a little race car driver who creates art when he shifts and drifts. Some liked it, some did not. But even if you are part of those where this film isn’t for you, I believe it’s impossible to not appreciate the boldness of the Wachowskis’ vision. I believe that ten years from now, we’ll still be talking about it.\n\n## \n\n## ",

        "text": "Centurion was a huge disappointment. I read that it had some comparisons to Apocalypto (love that movie), and I thought that a \"chase movie\" where Romans were getting their asses kicked by the native Picts sounded pretty great. It turns out that Centurion doesn't touch Apocalypto one bit.\n\nThe first hour of the 2010 action movie was terrible. That's bad enough, but its even worse when the movie is only about 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Bad pacing, editing, effects, overall direction. The pace was too fast; many moments lost power because it was flipping through events as quickly as possible. The editing was choppy; certain scenes felt like they were cut short, and there were many jarring cuts, tying into the pace. This film was very bloody and gory, but almost all of it was terrible CGI; I wouldn't care about the effects as much in a better film, but they drag down a disappointing film even more. The only believable character was Michael Fassbender's. There are some absolutely terrible characters, such as the black Roman soldier whose only trait is running fast. Yeah.\n\nI assume that Centurion was a British film due to the inclusion of multiple black and Asian people in the Roman army, as well as the multitude of female warriors for the Picts. Yes, there were people of color in the Roman army, but they were very few and very far between. About the female warriors; just one question: why? Do women connect with stoic, glaring, silent female warriors who are willing to die on the battlefield with men? If so, this may be the movie for you. But I am opposed to it. As Roger Ebert bluntly stated, \"Men are better at killing people.\" I guess I wanted more of a Braveheart and less of a Diversity Warriors for my historical war films. No need to be a documentary, but some realism would be nice.\n\nThere were many points during this first hour I felt like turning the movie off. I could barely look at the screen without cringing. I was pretty miserable, squirming in my seat like a rat. It was that bad.\n\nAfter the first hour, the film throws a decent shock at you, slows the hell down, and actually gets good. No spoilers, but I was actually enjoying myself. At the end of the first hour, I was ready to give the film a 0.5/10, but after the movie ended, I was ready to give it a 3/10.\n\nOverall, I don't recommend Centurion. I thought that this concept had a lot of potential, but it ended up letting me down. I really wanted to like this film. The only thing it has in common with Apocalypto is that the good guys get chased by the bad guys for a decent portion of the movie. The quality is nowhere near the same.\n\nhttps://m.imdb.com/title/tt1020558/",

        "text": " When I was about to watch Perfect Blue for the first time I did not know how to expect, I haven't researched about its plot and have only decided to watch it for the amount of positive star ratings I have seen people give to it. After watching the film, I think it's safe to say Satoshi Kon became my favorite japanese animation director side by side with Myiazaki.\n\n Right at the beggining I see myself watching an animated japanese idol girls show, and right at that iconic shot of the weird guy pretending to have Mima on his hands I thought it would be a stalker movie, which it is, but is also way over that.\n\n As the movie goes on, the stalking becomes only one more of the scary aspects of Mima's chaotic existence, her decision to leave her life as an \"aidoru\" \\(that by definition are supposed to be the role models for every boy and girl to follow\\), breaking her cute persona and becoming an actress bring up a completely confuse dynamic to the viewer, that ends up trying to always understand what's actually happening. Who's trying to kill her? Who's murdering those around her? Is it the stalker? Have she gone crazy due to this radical change in her lifestyle? What is real? What is fiction?\n\n What I, at first, thought would be a movie about stalking and later thought would be something like Black Swann ended up being a movie that's not only hard to follow and even disturbing, but a movie that brings up a number of deep messeges. Apart from the technical aspects \\(that are all flawless as well\\), this is a movie worth praising because it deals incredibly well with topics like: looking for new things in your life, what other people's expectations can do to you, the price of fame, the dangerous mixing between your public persona and your real self, etc. To me, Perfect Blue is actually perfect. What about you?",

        "text": "Sean Baker has a quite peculiar way of making a film. Many scenes in his films contain seemingly dramatic or high-conflict situations yet at the same don't expect or urge the viewer to invest themselves in the drama like most films and documentaries do. Instead many of these scenes are handled in a steady and lighthearted manner, allowing the viewer to simply watch in amusement or simple observance. \n\n(spoilers, not the best writing i apologize)\n\nThere are scenes in *The Florida Project* where little kids spit on a woman's car and so she deals with the carefree mom, kids turn turn off the entire apartment's electricity so the landlord has to deal with it, there's even a scene when the landlord confronts a pedophile. and a scene when the main character brutally beats up her former best friend.\n\nAll of these parts were done with no music or soundtrack to invest the viewer into the scene. Some of these moments that would probably devolve into more drama/conflict in most movies and TV show's but they dont. The moms end up having a casual conversation, the initially angry apartment tenants jokingly cheer for the landlord when the power goes on. There is no vengeful retaliation from the friend who got beat up. \n\nIt seems the only time a soundtrack comes in to invest the viewer emotionally in is at the ending as the kids escape to disney world. Yet even this is done in such a lighthearted tongue-in-cheek manner. \n\nI can appreciate Sean Baker's approach to drama/conflict where he seems to have the philosophy of \"Don't take things so seriously\" or some hippie shit like that. It is refreshing in a time of dramatic TV shows where characters get bitchy over the smallest things or engage in strung out conflicts and plot-twists for the sake of engaging and stimulating viewers. \n\nAnother director I can think of who approaches in this manner is Terrence Malick particularly in *The Tree of Life* where there is a detached yet positive way of showing conflict within the family. \n\nIs there a specific term or genre for this style of film/storytelling? And are there more directors like this? ",

        "text": "I went into Solo with low but hopeful expectations. I was quickly sucked into the story and found myself enjoying the film. There's one thing though that really irked me throughout the film; it uses too much expositional dialogue. \n\nI found myself thinking this line should be cut and that line should be cut. Lines like hey remember that move I tried in the ally that didn't work? Well I'm going to do it again or Hey it was I who stole your playing card you're trying to cheat with and here it is. Their was even multiple times were characters would straight up say how they felt about X. How about instead of telling me that upsets you, show us. \n\nI would have enjoyed the end scene of Han and Lando if it weren't for the dialogue. Here's how it went down: Chatting playing cards, trying to read each other, Lando thinks he has the upper hand, they both go all in, Lando goes to cheat like before but the card isn't their, Han tells Lando that he figured it out and reveals it was him who took the card. That scene would've been amazing if Han didn't explain to the whole audience what had happened. We're not dumb, we can put two and two together.\n\nWhat makes films like the original Star Wars trilogy great is the attention to detail to dialogue. You don't waste dialogue by having characters explain whats on screen and you don't have them straight up say \"I'm sad\" or \"That makes me angry.\" Great dialogue is poetic and allows the actor/actress to mold it into their performance. It allows great performances because the actor is showing us not telling us. \n\nNow we've all heard how they changed directors mid way through because of creative differences. I think the story is great but the movie is very raw. It has a lot going for it but it isn't executed to it's full potential. The dialogue should've been refined more than it was. It's hard to just pin it on the Kasdan brother's or Ron Howard. We don't know who wrote what but the studio ok'd the script. Why they didn't allow Howard more time to rework the script i.e. Dialogue is probably for business reasons. To me this film is a testament to how important dialogue is. I believe this film would've been amazing if they had more time to hone in the dialogue. ",

        "author": "JQuim",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/8nax6r/hypermasculinity_and_modern_emasculation_in_fight/",
        "text": "Upon an initial viewing, Fight Club appears to hold extreme views against the present day’s overly consumerist culture and its resulting emasculation of men. The film seems to present hypermasculinity as the only solution to escaping the chains of modern consumerism, however, as the film develops it becomes clear that the true message of the film does not promote hypermasculinity and instead warns against it. The Narrator undergoes an internal struggle as he fights against both his animalistic side, represented by Tyler Durden, and his emasculated side, represented by his unnamed self. Through the relationship between Marla, the Narrator and Tyler Durden, which begins as a purely physical relationship and evolves into love, the film offers balance as the only solution to both hypermasculinity and modern emasculation. \n\nThe film introduces the unnamed protagonist as being a slave to modern consumerist culture who is stripped of any sense of masculinity. Since the Narrator does not experience emotional stimulation from his everyday life as all his time is spent at an unfulfilling job and shopping at IKEA, to satisfy his human need for stimulation, the Narrator attends support groups seeking to forge a genuine connection with another human that is ironically formed through a feigned disability. As time passes, the Narrator seeks a connection that is deeper than what is offered in the support groups and expresses interest in Marla as evidenced by their exchange in ­­phone numbers. However, his romantic pursuit of Marla is held back by his hypermasculine alter\\-ego, Tyler Durden. In various moments throughout the film, the Narrator rejects the idea that he is developing feelings for Marla because he allows his animalistic self to overpower his emasculated self. One significant instance of his suppression of his feelings for Marla can be observed when Tyler Durden is chemically burning the Narrator’s hand. In the early act of the film, a cancer support group facilitator recommends that the group meditate and find their power animal to bring them through a difficult time in their life. In the Narrator’s initial vision, he sees a penguin sliding and later in the film, when he undergoes intense chemical pain, that penguin is replaced with Marla, his new power animal, which demonstrates that the Narrator does have feelings for her but will not act on them because of Tyler’s hypermasculine belief that love is for emasculated men. \n\nThe relationship between Marla and Tyler is purely physical. The Narrator’s rejection of Marla’s invitation to meet while she is overdosing on Xanax and the subsequent meeting between Tyler and Marla which led to them having sex for the entirety of a night represents the Narrator’s overpowering animalistic nature at this point in the film. Tyler openly expresses that his relationship with Marla “isn’t love” it is “sportfucking”. Their sex is animalistic, purely physical, and devoid of traditional aspects of western romance. Tyler’s rejection of traditional romance stems back to his childhood. He explains that he had no real father figure in his life and as a result did not have any guidance towards manhood. Instead, Tyler sought refuge in hypermasculine ideals because he never developed a healthy masculine identity. The only guidance Tyler’s father offered was the advice that it is “real important that \\[he\\] go graduate, go to college, get a job… get married”. Because of the lack of a positive masculine figure in his life, Tyler questions the societal emasculation of men and states that “we’re a generation raised by woman, I’m wondering if a woman is really the answer we need” which is evidence of Tyler’s reluctance to open himself up to Marla’s love and even more evidence of the frailty of Tyler Durden’s masculine identity. \n\nIt is not just Tyler who holds a fragile sense of masculinity. Most of the men in modern society are held captive by the lie that the American Dream presents and they are led to believe that “one day \\[they’d\\] all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars”. Tyler Durden’s Fight Club does not offer a concrete solution to the American Dream’s emasculating nature, it simply masks the members’ broken masculine identities by offering fleeting hypermasculinity as the only escape from the American Dream’s false promises. The transient nature of Tyler Durden’s Fight Club is discovered through the dichotomy between Ricky and the Narrator’s coworker, whose only concern is which color icon to pick. The contrast between Ricky and the Narrator’s coworker represents the focal point of Fight Club’s argument that neither hypermasculinity nor modern\\-emasculation is conducive to a life well lived. The Narrator’s co\\-workers worry about the color of an icon in a presentation, while Ricky, a supply clerk, “couldn't remember whether you ordered pens with blue ink or black ink ...But Ricky was a god for ten minutes last week when he trounced an actuary twice his size.” Replacing consumerist emasculation with animalistic masculinity does not solve anything. Violent escapism gives a man a fleeting sense of identity and will never lead to emotional fulfillment. For ten minutes, Ricky felt like a God, but once his fight ended, he is Ricky, a supply clerk whose only identity as a man is one characterized by violence and pain. \n\nThe members of Fight Club are emotionally unfulfilled and use the farce of male camaraderie, developed through violence, to fill the emotional gap in their souls. When Marla invites the Narrator to her apartment to check her breasts for a lump, she did so with the hope of evolving their relationship from a purely physical relationship to a relationship fraught with emotional depth. However, the Narrator hesitates to reciprocate emotional vulnerability because his alter\\-ego, Tyler Durden suppresses his ability to love. In a conversation between The Narrator and Marla, the Narrator asks “I don't understand. Why does a weak person have to go out and find a strong person... to hang onto?” to which Marla responds “What do you get out of it?”. The Narrator attempts to change the subject when the question is flipped to himself showing the viewers that the Narrator is still afraid of love, and still Tyler Durden. \n\n It is not until the climactic scene of Robert Paulsen’s death, that the Narrator finally rejects Tyler Durden’s influence on his ability to open himself up to Marla’s love. In the climax of the film, the Narrator recognizes the harm that hypermasculinity can cause. Robert’s death represents the shortcomings of giving in too strongly to the animalistic ideals of Tyler Durden’s Fight Club. Fight Club, which started as a means of escaping the emasculated conformity of modern consumer culture, paradoxically evolved into a new type of conformity. The men of Fight Club are no longer slaves to consumerism; they are now slaves to their skewed sense of what it means to be a man and the chant “his name is Robert Paulsen” symbolizes the hive mentality that they now hold. Their false perception of male identity is exacerbated to the point where fights no longer satiate their unfulfilled lives and so they resort to blowing up buildings for satisfaction. When the Narrator comes to the realization that his masculinity has gone too far, he metaphorically kills his hypermasculine self as he shoots Tyler Durden, effectively abandoning any sense of toxic masculinity that he once held. After killing Tyler, the Narrator is then able to accept Marla’s love into his life, representing the end of the Narrator’s emotional journey from an emasculated slave of society to a hypermasculine ego\\-maniac and finally to an emotionally mature man who recognizes the pros and cons of both masculinity and femininity.

        "author": "Jesccb",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/8n9d51/a_quiet_place_sonic_ownership/",
        "text": "The 2018 film A Quiet Place was a film with a difference. Most horror films are visual spectacles, all blood and gore propelled across the screen, guts dripping in front of our faces. A Quite Place (dir. John Krasinski) is a sonic horror film. Instead of being driven by visual shocks, the film is led by sound. The tagline to the film is “If They Hear You, They Hunt You”, this instantly sets up the premise that this will be an aural horror. The story centres around one family which have to operate in complete silence due to the creatures which have become the top predator. When the film joins the family the area, and presumably, the country have been dominated and largely wiped out by the creatures. Only a few survivors remain.\n\nThe film begins with the characters looking around an abandoned grocery store in bare feet gathering medical supplies. The family conduct their affairs in complete silence, the only sounds you hear are the minimal ones they make, the padding of their feet on the floor or the containers of things they slowly move and pick up. The first hint of the aural horror to come happens when the youngest boy (played by Cade Woodward) of the family starts to walk towards his father (played by John Krasinski) The family immediately pause and react like the child is holding a bomb as he takes a space shuttle toy from the child and carefully removes the batteries and gently places them on the counter. He then signs to the young boy explaining that this toy would make too much noise. This child has the equivalent of a bomb, to the child it is still a toy, but it is also an aural weapon. His deaf older sister (played by Millicent Simmonds) takes pity on him and gives him the toy but without the deadly addition of the batteries. However, the boy picks up the batteries and the family continue on their journey. When they approach the bridge to their home, the family hear the loud buzzing and beeping of the toy. This sound is the loudest of the film so far. The family freeze and turn around as the father sprints towards the child, looking as a mostly unseen creature moves through the trees. The creature snatches the child and kills him. These are the opening scenes of A Quiet Place. This world of aural horror that the family occupy in the post-apocalyptic western hemisphere is one where a simple child’s toy, a space shuttle which is supposed to create imaginative play and dreams of escapism, is now a bringer of death.\n\nOne possible reason why the family have been able to survive for so long into the silent post-apocalyptic world is due to the fact that the daughter is deaf and therefore the family are well equipped with their knowledge of sign language, so that they can still communicate whilst remaining hidden from the acute aural perception that the creatures possess. Millicent Simmonds who plays the daughter in the film is herself deaf. To cast a deaf actress in a role where the character is deaf, in a film which is all about perceptions of sound is vital. This creates a multi-layered interpretation of sound. A common thought is that to be deaf means to have no relationship to sound, or that it is a negative relationship to sound by the fact that it is not present. However, if like the daughter in A Quiet Place, there is a hearing aid, there is a, what is deemed, common relationship with sound: processed through the ear. If there is no cochlear implant or other form of aid, however, there is still a relationship with sound. In the right atmosphere, the objects can become haptic hearing aids, with vibrations from the sound passing through the air and colliding with objects to create a more physical sense of sound. It’s not wholly clear how hypersensitive the creatures’ hearing is. They might be able to hear in our standard way, but as well as this they might be able to use the world around them to pick up additional vibrations as sound interacts with the atmosphere and objects.\n\nAnother reason why the family have survived is that the father possessed the technical wizardry to hook up their land with cameras and is able to work on, fix and produce new hearing aids for his daughter. He regularly operates a radio system to try and contact any additional people that may be able to come a rescue them.\n\nUltimately this film is about who sound belongs to. The creatures have taken over, become top predators and decimated the human population by claiming something that is intrinsic to human daily existence. It is almost impossible to live without making sound. This was made painfully obvious to any cinemagoer to see the film. Not only are they made aware of the sounds that are made through the danger that the family face in making a constant effort to be quiet, but the film sound is also painfully quiet, without a score for most of the time. Therefore, anyone sitting and watching* A Quiet Place is made wholly conscious of every sound they make during the film. There were comments made on social media around the time of the film’s release about this, including some that were compiled into a Twitter moment. Several of them stated how painfully aware they were of every sound they made, including if they brought food or drink into the auditorium\nPart of the film focuses on the relationship between father and daughter and the perceived blame that the daughter thinks she has for her brother’s death. This comes to a crux within a signed conversation between father and daughter, when he gives her a mended hearing aid, which she rejects. In this moment she rejects (temporarily) technically aided cochlear hearing in favour of the world of silence, or at least powerful vibrational sound and silence. The creatures have forced humans to partially enter the daughter’s world of signing and silence. They have effectively had their voices stripped from them, it’s speak and die, make sound and die. Here, the film recalls the myth of Echo and Narcissus from Ovid’s Metamorphoses. Echo was a very chatty nymph who tricked the Goddess Juno, who then curses Echo so that she can only repeat back what was said to her. Echo can hear, but she does not possess her own voice, it is taken from her. In this respect, all humans have had the power of their voice stripped from them in order to survive. In A Quiet Place, the cinemagoer does not hear the daughter speak, we hear the other characters at various points, but not the daughter. In the exchange with her father, it is clear that she does not feel that sound belongs to her. However, throughout the course of the film, it becomes clear that she holds the key to unlocking the creatures’ weakness, something her father was trying to work on until his death. The myth of Echo is often used as an analogy for female roles in film, for example in Echo and Narcissus: Women’s Voices in Classical Hollywood Cinema written by Amy Lawrence. A female speaking character does not possess her own voice, she is merely there to be aurally subservient to a male leading role. Not only does A Quiet Place flip this notion by disabling the voices of everyone on screen, but it gives strong female characters and gives the power to the daughter by enabling her to have the ability to disarm and harm the creatures.\n\nThe stereotypical female character in a horror film is the shrieking and running live bait, eye candy for audience and horrific killer alike. A Quiet Place gives the audience two strong female characters. The mother, played by Emily Blunt, is strong enough so that when she impales her foot on a nail and has to give birth with a creature in her prowling nearby, she is able to stay quiet. In The Acoustic Mirror: The Female Voice in Psychoanalysis and Cinema, Kaja Silverman writes that the voice of a woman is considered to be less than her looks. Women are restricted to the role of Echo, only repeating or speaking from the place of the sexual other. As previously mentioned, this is often the case within horror films. Female characters exist to be sexual objects, splattered with blood, to utter a final hysterical scream** and then to depart the storyline.\n\n[Original post on re-sounding.blog](https://re-sounding.blog/2018/05/24/sonic-ownership-a-quiet-place/)Within A Quiet Place there is a reclaiming of sound, not just the human race taking back the dominance of sound from the creatures, but also female characters claiming sound to be their own space within a horror film. The daughter holds the key to defeating the creatures, or at least identifying their weakness. In the latter stages of the film, when the creatures are prowling the farm and the family are in grave danger there are two instances which indicate that she might hold the key. A creature approaches her from behind to attack her, she is unaware, however her hearing aid starts to give feedback hurting her ear and the creatures, forcing it to flee. The same thing happens when the girl and her surviving brother are in the silo. This leads to an interesting climax within the film when the family, now consisting of girl, brother and mother. The girl realises her hearing aid hurts the creature by interacting with it in some way and causing feedback, she turns up the dial on her father’s radio equipment and presses the hearing aid to it, causing an immense amount of feedback, which visibly causes the creature pain. Throughout the film the creatures have made noises which sound like a form of echolocation, with various clicks and chirps. In this scene the creature, now in pain makes these noises, but the cinemagoer now sees its head move and shake due to the feedback. The creature’s head is shaped like the inside of a giant ear, comprised of fleshy tunnels. It is this giant ear/head that makes the creature such a fierce predator and a dominant sonic being. It’s entire head is a receiver for sound. This is why it creates harsh feedback with the girl’s hearing aid and why it reacts painfully to loud feedback.\n\nOne could argue here that this scene, using a sonic weapon to destroy the creature is how the film needed to end. These are sonic beings and they should be killed by sound, not just weakened by it. It’s the ending a sonic horror film should have. However, this film is produced by Michael Bay and it’s right at the end that his influence has perhaps affected the film. Emily Blunt, the mother, armed with a gun shoots the creature, finishing it off. Cue “cool” scene with a female character striking a pose with a gun. Now this is no bad thing, a maternal female character being badass and protecting her children by shooting unknown horrific creature in the head. However, this moment felt unnecessary. It would have been a more powerful message if the deaf character in the film had finished the sonic creature off by harnessing sound for herself. There really was no need for the gun.\n\nThat being said, the film still does end with a deaf character, played by a deaf actress, using the power of sound to kill the creature. She harnesses the possibility of a sonic weapon, a notion had killed her brother in the opening scenes, and now turned it against the creatures that had supposedly taken sound over. This film is about the power that sound can play in a film, and takes the horror genre away from being a purely visual being. It’s also about the reclaiming of sound and notions about who does sound belong to. Sound, whether heard through the ear or through bodily vibrations is claimed back in this film for the female characters.\n\n*participating in audiovision (the lack of common terminology for speaking about going to a film that doesn’t refer to a solely visual encounter, means that I annoyingly wrote watching here. Refer to Michel Chion and audiovision could be used and become popularised.\n\n**The women’s scream requires a whole other essay to unpack as to why it is satisfying to hear from a sexual object but also has the potential to be a space of resistance.\n\nJesc Bunyard\n[Original blog post on re-sounding.blog](https://re-sounding.blog/2018/05/24/sonic-ownership-a-quiet-place/) ",
