A promotional interruption is a quick, 10-15 second break in programming to keep you up-to-date on Paramount+ shows or movies. Premium subscribers will also occasionally see short previews. Previews will not appear more than ONCE a day prior to the start of ONE show. Previews can appear before any Paramount+ show.\"\n\nLets start with the lie that the \"promotions\" are 10-15 seconds. In fact they are all no less than 30-60 seconds. Next, All the previews play all day. Watch three shows from any series and you can see this. Preview play at the being middle and end of all shows and in some cases this causes the show to error and stop play due to the subpar player they have.",

Literally, every week at the office talking about that week's episode some person brings up how the writers for the video game are stupid or they hope they don't do season 2 because it's going to be awful. And no matter what people say they just counter with, \"You haven't played it, it's so bad!!!!\"\n\nJust let us enjoy the show without bringing in your weird hate for the video game",

        "text": "I think this is a very underrated and fun TV series. I remember in 2008 when prepping up for 'Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls' they released the DVD sets and aired showings on History International (miss that channel). I, as now, had a big interest WWI and the air war so in a time where WWI content was scarce I was excited. Overall I thought it was a fun and educational series. Sure it seemed corny that he keeps bumping into about every important figure where he went but part of its charm was all the locations and historical events that Indy goes through. \n\nWhat I liked of the series is that they seemed to have done quite a good bit of research when writing episodes. For example, \"The Phantom Train of Doom\" where Indy and Remy gets lost in Africa and they bump into an armed band of older men that range from cowboys to a circus clown. I thought that was made up for the episode but as it turns out it was a real battalion. They were the [25th (Frontiersmen) Battalion, Royal Fusiliers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/25th_(Frontiersmen)_Battalion,_Royal_Fusiliers) and indeed there were quite a mix of characters in that group, including a clown. Also in \"Attack of the Hawkmen\", the German develop a giant triplane bomber set to fly long rang to bomb America. This was also based on history and was called the [Mannesmann Giant Triplane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mannesmann_Giant_Triplane) which was allegedly intended for New York to drop propaganda leaflets. I also thought it was great that they did episodes on the African and Middle East front which doesn't get much attention than the Western Front. \n\nOverall I though Sean Patrick Flanery did a great job as young Indy. There are also some actors in the show that stared before they were more well known such as Daniel Craig and Catherine Zeta Jones. The locations, production, and stories were great, especially for a TV series. Sadly the series was canceled due to costs and ratings. It was good for what is there and I highly recommend giving it a go!",

Maybe having darker themes allow you to have very multidimensional characters which is just more interesting, and because the characters aren't perfect having a good happy ending wouldn't be doing justice to the characters? \n\nThat's why I love puss in boots and other shows like that- they toy with dark themes without making me feel horrible LOL.

        "text": "2022 was an absolutely amazing year of television, specifically that 2nd half that featured The Boys Season 3, Stranger Things Season 4, Better Call Saul Season 6, House of the Dragon, The White Lotus Season 2 and Andor. \n\n2023 has already given us the best video game adaptation ever in The Last of Us plus before the 1st half of the year is over we will have Succession Season 4, Yellowjackets Season 2 and The Mandalorian Season 3. Every single show I just mentioned is eligible for the 75th Emmy Awards and is competing within the Outstanding Drama categories. That's not even to mention The Crown Season 5 which wasn't super well received but is usually very successful at the Emmys. \n\nThis has got to be one of the most stacked Emmy lineups ever and alot of it is spearheaded by HBO which has 4 of the shows I just mentioned, arguably 4 of the best shows out of an already impressive batch. Several networks have had stand out years in the past and gotten 2 or 3 shows within the same category nominated. But no network even with the expanded number of nominees in recent years, has gotten 4 shows competing for Outstanding Drama Series since the Golden Age of TV started in the 2000s. \n\nHaving this many nominees obviously shows they are an amazing network at the top of the field but also there is the downside that their can only be 1 winner. In the Supporting Actress and Supporting Actor categories, Jennifer Coolidge and F. Murray Abraham from White Lotus are considered favourites by some outlets and their biggest competition would be Sarah Snook and Matthew Macfayden from Succession. In the Lead Actor category, Brian Cox and Jeremy Strong from Succession already always compete with each other but now they are also against Pedro Pascal from TLOU and maybe Paddy Considine from HOTD. From HBO's perspective I worry that this is overkill and they are missing out on several wins because they are competing with themselves. \n\nThis could all actually be remedied with 1 change: Delay Succession Season 4 until the 2nd half of 2023. Succession out of all the shows mentioned is the biggest critical darling and would be the favourite regardless of what comes out in 2023/2024, especially because it's the final season. By doing this, HBO would give The White Lotus, The Last of Us and House of the Dragon more of the spotlight and a chance to rack up big wins at this year's Emmys while Succession could still probably sweep the 2024 Emmys.",

        "text": "I get that tv networks are super keen on adapting every single video game into a tv series but I think it's worth remembering that these stories are not the same as novels written by authors as they were primarily supposed to be games and not stories. Most of the main characters go around murdering everything.\n\nI think the lack of originality will catch up fast. Ghost of tsushima, god of war etc many people already know how these play out. What is the point? You're cannibalizing your own product by repeating the same story twice. And they're not even very good. There are so many authors with excellent ideas that are more suitable for television adaptations, why double down on a game that most people already are familiar with?\n\nAnyway. Remember to have your own opinion when watching these shows because online is always filled with paid reviews and astroturfing. You can bet your ass every single one of these game adaptations will have some bullshit 80/100 imdb rating or smth.",
