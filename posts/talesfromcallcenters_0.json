        "text": "This is a bit of a long one, but its one of my most vivid memories from my time in the call centre trenches. Before I was able to retreat to the general publicless world of software dev.\n\nOver a decade ago I spent a few years working for a (now defunct) 24 hour tech support service in the UK. It was actually an attempt to bring a well known American consumer tech support service here in advance of the an attempted launch of an American big box store over here to. Both eventually failed but I think the branding is still used by some third party stuff. Anyway.\n\nWe'd been having an issue with prank callers. They had taken to calling us and other call centres from a voip service, merging the calls then muting themselves. Then giggling themselves stupid while two confused call centre workers from different companies greeted each other before they figured out what happened.\n\nThis started to piss all of us off for a few reasons.\n\n1. It was really annoying when it happened to you.\n2. They were posting recordings online with insulting descriptions. Usually referencing the names from workers greetings which made it especially irritating.\n3. The first line support (which I was part of) had a monthly bonus based on various metrics. Each metric you met target on was worth a certain percentage. Sales of the support service subscription made up by far the biggest portion of this bonus and was based on a conversion percentage. Every one of these calls was one you couldn't possibly convert, driving your percentage down and possibly costing you half of your bonus that month. And some nights you'd get a lot of these calls.\n\nWe complained to management that these calls should be excluded from our stats, but they told us that short of listening to every call that comes in, this wasn't really possible. They didn't seem to have any intention of doing anything about it. Until one evening when they stepped over a line.\n\nOne of my coworkers hung up a call, put himself in not ready, and slammed down his headset.\n\n\"LITTLE BASTARDS!\"\n\nThe floor managers head pops up like an angry meerkat. We weren't meant to swear in the office even if we weren't on calls, as it may turn up in the background of a coworkers call.\n\n\"OI, LANGUAGE\"\n\nThe coworker turns around looking supremely pissed off and says \"THEY CONNECTED ME TO FUCKING CHILDLINE\". For anyone out side the UK, childline is an anonymous phone counselling service for kids. They speak to kids who are suffering bullying, abuse, mental health issues etc. They also help the kids get the help they need if the child chooses to. The fact that these dickheads were tying up lines for this service very much didn't sit well with the floor manager. She stands up with a face like thunder, pauses for a second and they says \"is there any way we can figure out who's making these calls?\". One of the lads in second line puts his hand up. \"I can take a crack at it\". She signs him off calls for the rest of the night and tells him to get on with it.\n\nSo if I remember correctly (and this probably isn't exact). He managed to use the youtube account name to find other places online where that username had been used. It turned up on a bunch of video game forums. He read through a bunch of the posts and on one of em he had listed an xbox gamertag. He searched for that and found a facebook page where the kid had made a post saying that was his gamertag if his mates want to add him. A few mates responded with theirs and they matched the account names of the first few commenters on the first video. Mission accomplished right? Nope. Scroll through the posts. Find a women in her early 40's with the same last name as his commenting on one of his photos that he \"looks so handsome\". And now we know who his mum is. Even better, on her profile she's posting about selling Avon. And has added her mobile number for people to ring if they want to put an order in.\n\nSo after about an hour this guy swaggers up to the floor manager. Hands her a post it with one of the prank callers name, his mums name, and the mums mobile number. \n\nThe manager rings it and in the sweetest customer service voice you've ever heard confirms who she's talking to, introduces herself, and explains the situation. From her responses you can tell the Mum is just kind of apologising but not really taking it seriously. Until the manager mentions what they'd been doing this particular evening. \n\n\"Yes, so while I agree up till now this has been fairly harmless, I'm afraid this evening they were doing it again, except they were repeatedly calling childline and connecting our operators. I'm not sure they really understand the seriousness of monopolising that services time.\"\n\nThe rest of the call was just mmhmm's and \"yes I agree's\". Eventually the call ends and the manager notices we've all been turned around in our chairs following the conversation. She grins and says \"that little shit is not gonna see daylight until Christmas. His mum was fucking livid\". \n\nThe youtube account hosting the videos was down by the end of our shift. And we don't get any prank calls like that again. I do wonder if that young lad is still grounded.",

        "text": "Excuse my English, i am not native English. I work at customer center for a health insurance company. Does that mean I have any input into changing the policy that this health insurance company dictates? No. Does that mean customers try to change the policy to exactly fit their exact wishes, even though they chose to be customers of our company? Yes.\n\nSo this one guy calls, mind you, this is the last call of my day and easily the worst. He calls because at his pharmacy they \"suddenly\" changed his medicine to another supplier, its the same medicine, just another company made this. He already right of the bat tells me that he should be informed of this.(umm, why? you aren't a doctor and its basically the same medicine?). I tell him, okay, i will go check out what is up and put him on hold, that i'm required to.\n\nI look at his medicine and the pharmacy picked it for him because our medicine policy changed, we picked a cheaper supplier. We do this because then we don't have to give these costs to him, the customer. It is insured. If the pharmacy gave him the other one, we had to actually charge him for it, this whole thing is like a policy of us and because of this, he doesn't have to pay for it. Other health companies don't operate like this and would always charge both medicines, it is essentially an **extra** service we provide so the customer can either not pay or pay for their preference medicine that is the same medicine but another supplier.\n\nDo I like it that my company can just change the policy of what medicine is free or not? No. However they work with experts and the government to chose what is cheapest for us and for the customer, if the company wouldn't do it, he would pay more for his montly payments and for his medicine.\nAlso interesting to know, if he has any bad side effects because of this medicine, which almost doesn't happen, he can go to his doctor and get a presciption to his old medcine. He will have to pay more for it, but not the full thing.\n\nSo i come back and try to tell him all of this like i'm required to. Before i can even finished all that i mentioned above and finish informing him, he rudely interrupts \"Woah woah woah\" and is outraged that we \"changed\" his medicine (its the same medicine, different supplier), then he goes on a huge rant that his stomach is extra sensitive and he needs the right medicine. I couldn't even tell him yet that he could get the old medicine and \"how DARE we change him without informing him\" (why didn't he ask in the pharmacy as to why it changed? The pharmacist knows even more than i know about this whole ordeal). Then he goes on and on how we can just dictate his medicine and that we use him as a lab rat to whats cheapest to us and how dare we try to make money in this company... \n\nThen he goes on that he wouldn't have mind paying for the medicine instead, so i finally get to tell him that he can get his old one back easy, just go to ur doctor, piece of cake. You think he is happy to hear this? Nope, he goes again on the same rant how its unfair and then he goes into the \"well why didn't you inform me of this change?\", that's when I'm starting to get annoyed so i told him \"sir this policy could changes like every 3 months, we can't inform every one of our millions of customers about every little change that applies to their situation, you can read our conditions on our site and you could have easily asked your pharmacist what changed too\". \n\nHe goes on his rant again: how dare we try to make money by picking another supplier of the same medicine, what if it might just give him horrible side effects or kill him or whatever..., how dare the company try to make money.... I kept thinking during this \"Oh i'm sorry, I was not aware you are a pharmacist or a doctor\" but that would be considered rude so i can't say that obviously.\n\nall during this whole ordeal i start weaning him off to the our complaint services, the people there can do much more than i can as customer services. As long as if it's fair enough. The customers don't realise that we from customer service cannot change policy, we can only inform of what is happening, ranting to us will not change what is happening to you, your only way to do within the company is through complaint services.\n\nHe never really replies to any of this, always straight up ignoring it, if i bring this up, going on and on about his rant. Now normally we have to give the customer 1 \"warning\" like \"i can't change this, so if this is all your questions...\" and if they then only have the same problem that i can't change, i can hang up on them. However this one boiled my blood so much that i kinda broke that rule by just saying \"okay well i can't change this situation and i already referred you to our complaint services, if everything is to clear to you, i wish you a nice day\" and then straight up, clicked him away while he was still talking.\n\nWoah was not expecting to tell such a long story, but yeah this was already on a bad day when i already got called an asshole by another customer and also been told i've been \"customer unfriendly\" by another. All i can do is inform the customer, if that information just happen to not contain what you want, then it isn't my fault, i can't change my answer, i don't have that power.",

I’ve been doing this for two years and they are cracking down on the amount of supervisor calls we have, the time we are on the phones, anything over 6 minutes needs to be reported to management, you’re dinged if you take too many restroom breaks etc….\n\nTo make it worse people are entitled… they feel they deserve everything and they deserve it now. They can’t fathom why their payment increases or why it’s taking so long for work on their account to be completed, “I am very important and I need this done now or I will whine and call you names.” I’ve been cursed at, told I’m horrible at my job, and talked down to like I’m an idiot.. I can’t take the abuse anymore….\n\nI’m literally just using this job to help me pay for my masters program…. Once I complete that and take my counselors test I’m done…. I just can’t take this anymore. I can’t quit since I need the money, but I also can’t enjoy life either. It’s so stressful and exhausting. I feel like I’m drowning and I dread going to work every fucking day….\n\nthis job is making me reach my breaking point, my life at home is deteriorating because I have no energy to do laundry or dishes or even cook after working 8+ hours back to back because they are also forcing mandatory overtime since they can’t get through the queue before my shift ends at 5 in the afternoon.\n\n\nI want to change my name and novel out of the country….

You threw your many years of patronage with your doctor around like it meant something. And then you proceeded to huff and puff as I followed the prompts I am required to follow. \n\nFine, we got through all that. Neither of us liked it, but we did it. \n\nAnd then we get to finally take your message and you can't spell your own name! Multiple times you gave it to me. Different ever time. You even did it phonetically! And yet you acted like I was wrong or stupid every time because what I repeated directly back to you was incorrect! I assure you, this is a recorded line and you sir, are the one that cannot spell your name. \n\nAt some point you got so frustrated that you stopped responding all together and unfortunately I cannot stay on the line with no response. I told you so. Still you didn't respond so I had to disconnect. \n\nI was so upset by your rudeness that I took 5 minutes to myself, off the clock, to calm down. I'd hoped that in those 5 minutes you would call back and someone else could deal with you because I didn't deserve to have to deal with you twice. All while the clock is ticking closer and closer to the end of my shift. \n\nBut you are such a special jerk. You waited 5 minutes before calling back. I not only had to deal with you twice! But you also made me get off work late! \n\nIdk what is wrong with you medically. You were so rude, so incompetent, and such an asshole. I've taken calls from people with true emergencies who have been no where near as rude as you. \n\nAnd just because you were born during the Vietnam War doesn't mean you fought in it.

It took me a whole long while to find work at all and I was glad I could finally contribute to expenses. Now, this is/was my first time in customer service. (I am working for a big toy brand.) At first I thought “it’s about toys, what could go wrong?”, oh sweet summer child.. I’ve never expected to meet so many nasty grown ups raging about something missing in their purchase, shipping, gifts with purchases, new releases, etc. Now I know better for sure. What irks me is that it feels like I am the only one in my team struggling so much with talking to customers, especially on the phone.\n\nAt the first, everything seemed to be fine, but once they throw you on the floor after training everything is just really overwhelming. My first proper call was one with the nastiest people I’ve ever encountered and my first escalation. (What a start!) After that it only went downhill from there. I avoided calls, I started taking antidepressants (I’m diagnosed with chronic depression so maybe I should have known that this job field might not be for me, but if you don’t try u never know, right?) and now having to see specialist due to heart issues and high blood pressure.\n\nToday I handed in my resignation. Funny, we had a team as meeting as well where everyone was supposed to share their experiences. I feel like I was the only one who outright said “I can’t do this, I don’t like the work”. Everyone else just was positive vibes, so grateful for this company, grateful for this work. Is there something wrong with me? \n\nI tried to work against the stress with my doctors writing me letters to at least ease all the pressure that’s on me lately, but my TL couldn’t help. I can understand that he’s night the highest in line and HR needs to approve, but he literally just discarded the second letter and hit me with “no special treatment”. But then every time I go office I see ads for “have a better work life balance, mental health matters”. Idk. This whole experience just makes me feel like there’s something wrong with me, haha.\n\nGuess that’s it. Sorry for the lengthy post. Will follow what one CU told me on the phone the other day “why do you even have this job if you can’t do it right, how can you even work here!” … 🫡",

The customer wasn't even a senior citizen who did not know much about scams and frauds.

The fraudster then asked the customer to confirm their credit card number, CVC, expiry date, old and new address, and even their banking password, and the customer happily gave away all their details anticipating some better changes on their credit card.\n\nAn hour or two after speaking with the fraudster, the customer called the bank to advise about this incident. First I told the customer that the bank will NEVER call them first no matter what and not to disclose their banking credentials to anyone because it's literally confidential for obvious reasons. I asked for their details to begin with, so I could pull up their file on my system, but the client resisted.\n\nC: \"*You called me an hour ago to apply a better rate on my account, and I don't see it yet.

        "text": "I worked in medical billing from 2015-2019. I have many tales I can share.  Part of my job duties involved calling people to go over what their  insurance policies would cover in regards to surgical procedures, treatments, visits, and sometimes medications.  The annoying issues I ran into were cases of parents adult children living at home demanding that I tell them the purpose of the call for their adult children and I had to explain that I could only speak to their adult children and then there were the spouses of patients who demanded the same thing.  I found often there are a good amount of people who didn't seem to understand or even know about the existence of HIPAA laws. Here's one of those tales.\n\nMe-Billing Agent (BA) \n\nAnnoying Wife of Patient-AWP\n\nAdditional info-Patient was scheduled for an upcoming surgery and no HIPAA authorizations were on his file. \n\nI call the home- \"Hello, this is BA from Such and Such Health Insurance company, may I speak with John Doe?\" \n\nAWP- He's out in the garage, I'm his wife.\" \n\nBA- \"Is he available to speak with me? Or can I arrange a call back?\" \n\nAWP-\"I filled out his paperwork and you can speak to me\".\n\nBA-\"M'aam\" I can only speak with him\".\n\nAWP- \"Like I said I filled out his paperwork and you speak to me\".\n\nI then again tell her that I can only speak to him. I set up the callback. Called several hours later and spoke to the patient. I could hear the wife in the background butting in with the answers and such.\n\nAfter that encounter and similar encounters on that job I made the vow that if I ever got married I wouldn't butt into things or situations that my wife can handle on her own given that she has the ability to speak on her own behalf. Yes, there are situations that warrant medical POAs and HIPAA authorization involvement because of things like dementia, brain injuries, issues communicating due to stroke, illness, etc.  If a person is able to speak on their own behalf and they have all their faculties in tact,  then they should do so and spouses or other family members need to respect that and not butt in or make demands of people working for insurance companies, hospital billing etc. \n\nAdditional note-Another memorable incident on that job involved a 19 year old male. His mother answered the phone number on file and kept ranting \"I'm his mother you can talk to me\".   I laughed after that call because I lived at home due to finances and to help my parents with my grandmother until I was 21. But, my parents never butted into my business regarding insurance, my job, and other things.   Years later, when I worked in billing it made me glad that my parents aren't nosy assholes.",

        "text": "So I got the angriest of angry women on my line who wanted nothing but her exact demands done. \n\nShe called in because she had placed an order her self online but with an agent on the phone basically as a support buddy. \n\nThe agent couldn't see her cart, her products, and she didn't know the CX intent.\n\nThe CX got stackable washer and dryer. This could be because she wants to stack them or because their size or just because they are cute and do the job... \n\nAgain the agent wasn't placing the order so her on screen prompts wouldn't happen for upsells and reminders. \n\nThe CX without doing due diligence just bought everything she wanted. \n\nNow to delivery day. \n\nCX wants DT (delivery team) to stack. \n\nCX didn't buy a stacking kit. \n\nCX calls me angry because she doesn't have one. \n\nI apologize de-escalate and go to find correct one. \n\nOOPs it's Out of stock. \n\nI look it up and find it on other providers but we personally don't have it. \n\nI advise that we don't have it but for inconvenience of not having it and for not being able to do install for her I will discount product for her refund. \n\nNO DICE \n\nCX says, \"Listen lady I paid for install so I am going to get installed.\" (Instal is free y'all) \n\nI responded I'm sorry for the inconvenience but as you did not purchase a stacking kit the stacking instal is not included in your purchase and the delivery team can only instal your washer and dryer side by side as space provides. \n\nCX again, \"look lady your customer service for a 70 year old is awful and I don't even know how much it would cost to get someone else to install.\"\n\nMe I am so sorry for the inconvenience i can offer you (higher than last amount) to help with that and can get you to our department who can find someone in your area to complete instal or there are even handyman type apps like (thumbtack) where you can find someone for very affordable prices. Again your installs were free and we would like to help you with this inconvenience. \n\nGoes off on me for solid 10 minutes to which she finally refuses any amount we would offer and demands instal date. \n\nI put her in for installation and remind her that we will only instal the washer and dryer not stack them. She sneers. And when I close the call she makes a comment on how she is going to tank my survey. \n\nI told her I understand her frustration and still wish her a wonderful day. \n\nEnd of interaction right?!?!\n\nNO BECAUSE THIS LADY GOT TIME NOW\n\nI immediately call the delivery team and have them notate in capital letters not to stack her system for liability reasons. It will be an outside vendor product or possibly a generic piece and if they cause damage they will be held responsible. (Basically just reminding them of their contract since so many see an old lady and are like sure why not let's just do it.) \n\nTo be fair normally I'm also like do the nice thing if you have a second DT like it may result in a tip or just good karma. BUT I WANT THIS WOMAN STUCK WITH NO DISCOUNT AND NON STACKED NON RETURNABLE WASHER AND DRYERS.",

Work was busy but satisfying; sometimes I was even able to help a customer. \n\nIn 2022, word came down that my department was being moved off shore. I, along with 4 other senior agents, were left behind to finish training our replacements. We were promised a training start date and that we would join our original team once the off shore folks were trained.\n\nOur worst fears materialized. Our training was canceled, and we ended up in a different department - that ultimately was offshored in Jan 2023.\n\nAs part of the new assignment, we were expected to go 2 weeks without working any hours, then attend training for the last 3 days of the pay period, effectively making it 30 days without income.\n\nI decided to get out. I am now working as a substitute teacher at the school where my wife teaches. I work almost every day, and I can schedule days off without penalty.\n\nI took my vacation days right before quitting. I politely emailed my supervisors and let them know I would not be back.\n\nA week later, I get a call from someone with a heavy Indian accent who said he was from HR. \"You have not logged in since xx/xx,\" he says. \"Yes, I quit last week. I don't have time for your call at this moment.\" \n\nThe next week, I get an email from another HR drone wanting to offer me a position in another division. I wrote her back a detailed explanation of why I was not interested.\n\nTwo weeks later, another HR drone from another office mailed me my separation notice, which indicates that I was separated for the reason: \"inability to contact employee.\"",

Instead of trying to internally transfer me, they are micromanaging me to try to get me to quit. \n\nThey say I need to keep the calls less than 6 minutes which is impossible in the type of work that I do. I'm having a hard time getting out because of my age. \n\nI got written up for just my calls not being less than 6 minutes. So, I asked to sit next to two reps to see how they work their calls. It turns out that the 6 min standard isn't applied uniformly. And the rep I sat with was left with negative comments by the customer who said she was confused and the agent then accidently hung up by mistake and then beep, another call comes in. Agent talks monotone and sounds scripted. She didn't seem to care one way or the other about the caller.\n\nAnd that is what the company actually wants, \"Just get the caller off the phone, don't answer anything beyond the call itself, stay quiet, pause, don't care and quickly cold transfer them and get them off the phone.\"\n\nYet I was told in training we warm transfer the call if we need to send caller to a different dept.\n\nI have no attendance issues. They just don't want me to care so much and to get the caller off the phone. \n\nI toggle back and forth on 8 different systems to access documents and email them to the customer or to access their account and take payment. My systems are slow. They freeze up. The boss wants to try and blame me for not keeping calls less than 6 minutes which is hard. The boss has never done this job.\n\nThey really want me to quit because I am overqualified and desire to work in another dept or in management where my skills would be a better fit. \n\nBut they want me to just quit or they will push me out. Again, it isn't easy to just get another job  If I could, I would. \n\nThey will say because I can't keep my calls less than 6 minutes, I can't transfer out of the dept. And I have to remain in the job for another year. \n\nI think the micromanaged keep the AHT within 360 seconds is an arbitrary rule to justify a termination. Employers can say anything they want. I spend my weekends recovering from the bullying at work. My pay is extremely low too. \n\nIs it possible these jobs are wotc jobs and are expected to be short term and subsidized? (Google wotc and your State).\n\nAgain, they are giving passes to coworkers who make errors but holding up the rigid standards towards me to terminate me. They won't transfer me to a non-phone dept where I could still do good work.",

        "text": "I was reading a story here and i dont know why but this popped into my mind. \n\nI worked at a call center as bilingual csa and then became a trainer, and at the same time, escalations. The company provided call center for other companies. The contract I worked for was for a certain big discount subscription that is associated mostly with older people and “insurance”. (Funny thing, they work with an insurance company, but they didn’t provide the insurance lol)\n\nBut when I was still a grunt, one of my first calls was an older man. He was furious about his insurance policy, and I, as always in formed him that I would be happy to transfer him to the insurance company, but we are merely in business with them, we do not have access to his medical information or anything like that because of HIPPA. We “promote” the insurance company to our members and in exchange, they offer our members a discount of their premiums. But that’s all handled on their end. \n\nRegardless of what I tried to explain he insisted I PERSONALLY fix his issue with his policy, and I just kept repeating, “Sir, again, we are X, not your insurance company. We provide them with a sort of marketing service and they provide YOU a discount for being associated with US, but nobody in THIS company can access your medical insurance information, we’re not authorized, licensed  or certified, and that would violate HIPPA.”\n\nWe can only transfer to escalations if THEY ask for a manager. \n\nWe ARE authorized to hang up if they become abusive, after three warnings. \n\nI had given him two. \n\nHe kept screaming at me and I gave him the third warning. \n\n“Sir, I am going to have to ask one last time that you lower your voice or I will have to end the call”. \n\nHe LOST IT. Started cussing and yelling even louder not wanting to accept any advice or solutions. And I laughed but muted too late. He heard my giggle. And I didn’t think this man could get any angrier. But he went silent. And then \n\n“Did you just laugh at me?”\n\n“No sir, I laugh when I’m nervous and your yelling is making me nervous.” \n\nHe then began to mock me, “Oh are you gonna cry? For fucks sake are you a baby?”\n\n\nI just said my closing and hung up. \n\n\n\nI was always polite to all workers. But Honestly that job is the reason I now go ABOVE AND BEYOND to ask about how your day’s going without taking too much time, engage in small talk while you’re fetching information so there’s no dead air, always have all my info ready and ask for a review form to be sent and give you a 10/10 unless they’re just plain rude. Even if they couldn’t fix me issue. \n\nFucking whackjob",

One of my first questions is \"what zip code are you in\".  She tells me \"65249\".  I confirm \"Ok, you're in Eastown, in West County?\".  \"No, i'm in Northtown in South County\".  I put in her location manually and tell her \"The zip code for that town is actually 76218\".  \"No it's not\".   OK, not worth arguing over a zip code.  I just enter the correct one.  I then have to assess if she's in any danger.  \"Are you currently in any....\"  She interrupts, yelling \"No!\".  I tell her \"I have to ask these questions.  Are you currently in any....\"  \"I SAID NO!  I know what you're going to ask and the answer is no!\".   As nicely as possible, i tell her \"I need to ask you these questions, and i'll need a yes or no answer once i'm done\".  I ask my safety assessment, and..... Silence.  \"I need a yes or no answer\".  \"You already got my answer\".  OK.  I ask a few more demographic questions, and getting the answers is like pulling teeth.  Then i have to read a consent statement before asking the more personal questions.  Of course, she says she won't consent.  I explain to her that \"without answering these questions, I will be very limited in what I can do to help you\".  \"That's OK, jesus will provide for me\".   I gave her the number for her local Board of Social Services, which is the bare minimum we give and she ended the call with \"Thanks for not helping me.

        "text": "This is a good vibe for me. Happened mid pandemic, but it gives me warm fuzzies when I think of it.\n I work in agent support for a cell phone company, agent xfers because they don't know how to help a reasonably distraught AH. The usual: they really want something done for her but no idea what. Fine, warm transfer me the sob story. \n AH is upset because her ex keeps getting into her account online and changing her info. Then she lays it all on me: she's in hiding from her abuser, he's been released ROR, restraining order etc you get the idea. Now he's getting her family's addresses that she's been using for billing.\n Easy fix, we shut down online access, paperless billing. Not ideal for her, but she's ok with calling for everything. Resolved? Not yet.\n He also purchased a phone on a payment plan on her account, then move the line to his own account (also with our company) but has sh!t credit and doesn't qualify for a payment plan. This leaves her with the payments on a flagship model (sadly not something I could change) she doesn't even have. So despite her best efforts he's still managing to stick it to her financially too.\n Now I've been in this industry for several years, and I am solution oriented. I am also petty AF, because malicious compliance is still compliance.\n Now we can't touch his account because that would be fraud and some other violations..and that is wrong.\n However, the phone itself is hers. He won't give it to her, so he has technically stolen it, and stealing is also wrong 😈\n So I sent a ticket to the carrier we resell to blacklist the phone. It's a relatively litigious process, and they generally do not appreciate anything more than cut and dry facts. I took a shot and gave them the short form, \"AH's abuser has refused to return the device blah blah blah\". Downside of tickets is they can take a week to complete, usually 3 days minimum assuming your ticket is started same day.\n I'm really not expecting much and let her know the process, but fingers crossed because it's a start.\n Got a response in under 10mins, the usual copy paste \"my name is X, I will be happy to assist-\" .... \"I got you. Blacklisting complete. Any associated line will suspend within 24hrs. Good luck\".\n She is thrilled, solidarity is appreciated. She is  especially stoked when she realizes that when he doesn't show up for court (this was mid pandemic so video call hearings) a warrant will be issued.\n Really all I did was blacklist a phone, but it was a little win for her with potentially bigger implications.\n Made my day, and I use it for a pick me up when I feel like quitting.",

But they then became upset when the paperwork turned up, due to a fee that we told them about when they signed.\n\nThe way it works is that, whoever you sign up through, there's a particular fee. You even pay this fee if you sign through the supplier directly. This fee is included in your unit rates, so you don't ever pay it directly, but for reasons, the regulators want it listed.\n\nIt typically typically works out at around 0.1% to 1% of your bill, depending on what the signing party set it at. We set it at the minimum.\n\nThe customer has misread the paperwork and thinks we're going to bill them this full fee, directly, up-front, and will not listen to anyone telling them otherwise. They're also upset that they have to pay this amount and think they could go elsewhere and pay less as a result.\n\nThey also signed up for a pre-pay supply, as these are cheaper and have lower credit criteria. You keep your supply topped up like a PAYG mobile. Their first bill is an estimated month to get them set up, then they top up themselves.\n\nThe customer receives this bill on day seven of their contract and thinks that this month forward bill is actually a seven days in arrears bill, and thus the price is a rip-off.\n\nOf course, when they call in, they refuse to be told that they are wrong. I even talk the through the paperwork and the numbers on their account so they can see that they're wrong, but to no avail.\n\nAnd now they complain to their Member of Parliament, who has written to us asking us to please investigate. Credit where credit is due, the MP is being very polite &amp; diplomatic.\n\nI just handed a full report to the MD. I’d sure the MP will have a good laugh when they read it and see how foolish their constituent is being.",

Easy, I just need a model number and then I can answer her questions. She gives me \"Vendors\" assigned model number for our product, which is not one of our model numbers. I try to pull it up on Vendors site so I can try to visually identify the product and it pulls nothing up. \n\nSo-I let her know that the number she provided isn't pulling anything up and I ask her if she could find the couch on our website and read off the model number for me real quick. \n\nShe says \"I'm already on your site, you're telling me you can't find YOUR own product on your site?\"\n\nI tell her \"No ma'am, you are not on our site, you are on Vendors site.

Yes, I know it seems like all call centers offer this nowadays, but this company was (still is) legit. They won national and highly commendable awards for it.\n\nEvery quarter, our Head of Dept. would come in and give us updates in what the company has improves on for customers and employees. We were told metrics all across the board. \n\nOn this particular one, the Head of Dept. informed us that recent anonymous surveys from the employees weren't happy with their wage. Whilst the company at the time offered above minimum wage it was approx £4.00 more. With recent economic crises that is nothing.  \n\nSo in comes the Head Karen all with her (attempted) stern voice, \n\n&gt; **Karen:** This company pays you a lot of money for the work that you do. If *I* was the CEO I would decrease your wages. So be mindful of what you say on these surveys because it cold backfire. I don't want any of you to be here just for the money and then go home. Because I'm not going to see you for more than 6 months. You should be happy to work here every single day.\n\nAnd I left that bizarre meeting and though, *but everyone comes to work for the money.

My motive was during the time I was doing this, I was really having a hard time. I was depressed and feeling no motivation to show up to work at all and just to avoid being called out by my superiors, I used my real medical records before and started editing it to pass on to them.\n\nThe management and environment had nothing to do with how I felt during that time. It was all me, I was the problem, I had felt extremely tired of my own failures and whether I can become something I can be proud of for my sake. I could say I was and still suffering from my depression, regrets and insecurities as a person. After a few weeks, I was questioned by the management about the documents I've submitted which they've investigated already and I straight-out admitted that I faked those documents.\n\nOf course, I understood that I had no escape of the consequence that would befall me but after they heard me out and proceeded with our HR management's hearing. They gave me advice about how to look at life and how to confront these kind of feelings towards work and life. It did give me somewhat motivation to better myself and I was clinging to a slitter of hope that they would give me another chance. I went to work as usual without any lates or absences for 3 weeks straight but on my final day(Feb 21st) my superior had pulled me out and I knew it was coming. It was already my last day and I had to pack up my stuff and surrender everything.\n\nSo far, I've been trying to look a for a new job which is in call center setting again and have miserably failed my application thrice now. The one thing in common with the companies I've failed in is I was able to make it to final interview that would next lead to the Job offer. I've mentioned this termination and the story behind it but in a positive way. However in the end, I still failed.\n\nShould I even mention this episode at all and keep this company in my resume during my next applications or should I remove them completely? Or do I need to rephrase how I explained my termination experience in a more positive way?",

The details of the programs I handle aren’t terribly important for this story, all you need to know is that we allow for gift card redemptions outside of the company (but the points are worth less than if they redeemed with the company), and that once the redemption is processed, it’s in the hands of a third party gift card company. We can’t do squat. The only exception to this is if it was processed manually, in which case we have to resubmit the request manually if it’s been more than ten business days since it was requested.\n\nSo this lady calls in, she’s very nice. Turns out it’s the daughter of the customer speaking, and I sure wish I’d gotten to speak to her daughter the whole time. I verify, blah blah blah, you know the drill. She’s mad her gift card hasn’t arrived yet. That’s fair; it’s past the time frame and should be investigated. Issue is, I guess the customer took the phone from her daughter and decided to bitch me out. She will hereafter be referred to as “C”.\n\nMe: I do apologize for—\n\nC: don’t need your apologies! Are y’all playing with me?!\n\nMe: of course not, ma’am. We’re trying to get this gift card out to you as fast as possible. If I could just get some information—\n\nNow at this point, my dear readers, I feel the need to inform you that the customer decided she was not on the phone with someone whose fanficrion-writing was being interrupted, but rather auditioning for the role of a banshee, because only a harbinger of death is in possession of the lungs required to scream-talk the way this woman was doing.\n\nC: y’all are playing with me! I think the girl who sent the card sent it to herself!\n\nMe: actually ma’am, that is not possible, because— (she cuts me off again here, but I was gonna tell her that it’s entirely automated and we can’t change the address it sends to even if we want to)\n\nC: I ain’t no kid! Y’all can’t mess with me! Y’all don’t know who you’re messing with!\n\nNow, I have a very peppy, upbeat-sounding customer service voice. I’m kind and empathetic. I also sound a bit like a fifteen-year-old girl. At this point, however, I’m done with being screamed at, and I used to work childcare, so my voice can get very firm very quickly.\n\nMe, now using mom-voice: ma’am, I understand that you are frustrated. However, if you are unable to be professional during this call, I will have to disconnect.\n\nC, somehow screaming even louder than before: I am being professional, missy—\n\nShe continued to scream, and I believe she also berated me some, and she wouldn’t let me get a word in, so I simply started to talk over her. \n\nMe: since you are unable to be professional, I will now be disconnecting. Have a nice day.\n\nAnd then I hung up. I wasn’t even able to send it up for investigation the way it should’ve gotten sent up. Honestly, I’m probably missing huge chunks because it’s been a few weeks, but I remember feeling very strongly afterwards that she should never get her gift card if that’s how she treats people.",

I’m performing for shit. And I’m struggling so hard with just taking another call, to the point where I am often checking out while in wrap, taking unscheduled breaks, and leaving people on hold much longer than allowed. \n\nWhen I first started this job, I was getting great stats and felt great even on tough days. I had previously worked in restaurant management, and the work was much more physically demanding with long long days on my feet- so I know I’m not intrinsically lazy- I’m just acting very lazy lately. \n\nI’ve struggled with depression before, this doesn’t feel like that felt- I can get out of bed, I can take care of myself (mostly)… I just cannot stay focused at work. Regardless, I’m bringing out all my tried and true depression fighting tools (sunlight lamp, gratitude journal, high protein diet, supplements, staying away from most negative media) \n\n… and… still constantly fighting the overwhelming mental demand to call off mid-day, to take 3 minutes to just breathe in wrap, to go off phone unscheduled and just… hear SILENCE for a bit.\n\nI still get 100% QAs, client compliments on surveys, am able to effectively help a lot of newer people on senior line, but I’m sucking at my own most basic requirement- picking up the damn phone. \n\nI know from being on this sub a lot that people will say “get out” “do something else” but assuming I NEED to stay in this job at least another year, what the hell can I do to keep my job and sanity? I have a meeting with my boss tomorrow and I’m absolutely terrified to face ANOTHER conversation about my shit stats and possibly being put on a PIP/fired… does anyone have ANY advice ?",

        "text": "I took a call from a customer to verify a simple payment.  In which that turned into a 40+ minute call yesterday.     \n\nShe was essentially 2 billing cycles past due and she paid enough to cover the remaining balance of the bill that was furthest past due.   She called in to confirm we received it.  Advised we did and that now only left $xxx past due.   She wrote that down in some journal she kept.   Then she clued in that I said that she still had a past due balance.   She asked what the total balance on the account was.  I told her and she wrote that down.  \n\n\nShe then asked me what the current bill was.  I told her that and she wrote it down.   I then thought that portion was finished and asked her if there was anything else I could help her with, and brought up payment arrangements to cover the remaining past due balance such as extensions to give her more time to avoid disconnection of her services.    But then she got confused and said along the lines of “wait, I just paid off the past due balance.  Why are you saying I still have a past due balance?”   \n\nI went into telling her we just read the meter for her home the day before so the new bill just came out today, so if she hadn’t Received the bill yet that’s why.   And that ultimately pushed what was due for the month before’s bill to be past due now.  \nThen she said she just paid the past due so she shouldn’t owe anything that’s past due now.   \n\nQueue going over this 5-6 more times in different ways to see if she gets what happened.  Which none went through to her.  And unfortunately she didn’t have any of her bills in front of her so I couldn’t have her look at what the breakdown of the bill so she could see she was past due and what was currently due as a visual clue to help her logic skills kick in.   Eventually I had to get her in touch with a supervisor because I wasn’t getting anywhere with her and she still wanted to know what was going on.   \n\nWhy is this so hard to comprehend?  Is there some way that I need to speak so people are less confused?",

        "text": "I work remotely for an insurance call center handling complex technical calls, taking escalations, and handling some light underwriting work. Most of my calls are ho-hum technical calls, a lot of which involve me teaching reps more about insurance than training ever did. I handle escalations about billing and underwriting, which are almost always a variation of \"How dare you tell me that you won't insure me for free!\" I work a late shift, so I handle more than just the Garden Variety Crazy or Demanding Karen. I handle the ones who are willing to call an insurance company at 2 a.m. to yell at someone. \n\nYour intrepid writer is in the middle of reading Reddit posts about her favorite trashy TV show when a call comes through the line. It's an escalated call involving billing. Specifically, billing because we found something out about this \n\nCustomer is upset because he discovered that we added an endorsement to his policy. Specifically an endorsement that would provide coverage, since he drives for Grubhub. He was driving for Grubhub when he got into an accident three months prior. Claims paid the claim, but told Underwriting to retroactively add the endorsement to the policy to back up the coverage.\n\nOkay, the endorsement added about $200 a month to his policy. We went back to the date of the loss, which was two months prior to our conversation. I get the call and this guy is clearly driving his car while talking to me. Not that I give a rat's ass or anything about that, but it's not a smart look to do that when you're on the phone with your auto insurance company. We judge you harshly for shit like that. (Not monetarily, but we talk massive smack about you afterwards.)\n\n\"I never gave you guys permission to make that change.\"\n\n\"Sir, your policy contract literally states on page 20, section A, subsection 1 that should we discover additional information that would affect coverage materially, we're able to make the adjustment to the contract.\"\n\n\"Take off the endorsement.\"\n\n\"We can do that, but we'll have to make it effective as of today's date, which will not change your existing bill.\"\n\n(Assorted grumbling here.) \"All right, fine.\"\n\nSo we're going through the motions of removing this endorsement from the policy for his food delivery app. Remember, the endorsement does not specify that it's only for Grubhub or any other app company. (We use it for things like Uber, Lyft, Instacart, Shipt, and a few others.) I have to get him to agree to multiple items. We're about halfway through when this gem comes out of his mouth:\n\n\"Hold on, sweetie, I need to take care of this.\" I initially thought he was talking to his kid, but realize a second later that I was the sweetie. Ugh, whatever, troglodyte.\n\nHe puts the phone down in his car and I don't hear him quite as clearly. But I hear him and background noises. Drive-thru background noises for McDonald's. And then he says the following, most likely thinking that I (and the recorded line) can't hear him.\n\n\"Yeah, picking up an order for Doordash, name is Bob Loblaw.\"\n\nOh, so that's how it's gonna go, eh? I mull over whether to pretend like I didn't hear anything in order for him to have a claim denied in his next accident, or confront him with the truth. I make my decision and await for Troglodyte to come back onto the line.\n\nHis response: \"Yeah, sorry about that, I needed to do something important.\"\n\nMe, not regretting the decision I went with: \"Hey, anytime. Say, how many more restaurants are you going to Dash for while you're on this phone call with me?\"\n\nRealizing that I had just stopped subsequent smoke from being blown up my ass, he gets very quiet. This is when he \"accidentally\" hangs up.\n\nThe notes on that policy from me were, to put it kindly, epic. He ended up trying with another rep in my department, then requested to elevate to our supervisor. The person he got was amused enough to let me know because he listened to our phone call. He said he found my vocal poker face impressive.",

Why not?\n\nMe: because you don’t have an account yet. You would need to set up an account in order to get points. \n\nC: but I didn’t get any points\n\n(By this time, I’m getting frustrated.

They're not cheap and we send them by signature required mail or locker mail because again, they're expensive. \n\nThis is a conversation I had with a doctor. An educated human. \n\nMe: hi this is OP, can I help you? \n\nDingaling: hi yes you sent my sample to my PO box and I didn't want it sent there. You need it to send it to this address (in next city over) \n\nMe: hi, sorry to hear there's a problem. Who am I speaking with?\n\nDL: this is Dr. fuckface Dingaling from beep pop. Why did you send my sample to the spouffadouff office? I want all my mail sent here to my beep bop location!\n\nMe: *looks on his file. Sees no mention of this anywhere* OK I'm sorry Dr. Dingaling, but I don't see this anywhere in your file. When did you request that mail is sent to beep bop?\n\nDL: oh this morning. So you'll have to re-send my sample to beep bop\n\nMe: Oh. (thinking to myself oh no.) Well Dr. Dingaling, unfortunately I cannot do that. Address change requests take 1 to 2 business days to process. The sample was sent two weeks ago when you finished the course...to the address you had requested...two weeks ago. So I cannot change the address. It's been sent. (I look at the tracking number.) oh I can see it's been sitting at a parcel locker of spouffadouff. It's been there since Monday. You're welcome to go collect and I'll note in the file that if any employees take the course in the future, we'll send their sample to beep bop.\n\nDL: what ! Why is it in a locker! You need to send it to beep bop!\n\nMe: I can't. It's been sent  \n\nD: Well go get it and resend it!\n\nMe: Dr. Dingaling... My company is based in city x. You live in city y...on the other side of the country. You need to collect your mail and notify us in the future if there are account changes ASAP or before samples are requested\n\nDL: this is ridiculous! I'm not going to get it, you can keep your stupid sample\n\nMe: ok..well it'll be there if you change your mind\n\nDL: slams down phone\n\nI had a wonderful time sending an email to management requesting they send out a sales rep to teach a customer how mail works. I've heard some dumb shit but this man has access to narcotics",

Today while assisting a customer to set up the automatic payments on his loan we hit a little snag on the road because the customer insisted that I was providing him incorrect information about his loan. The conversation ended like this:\n\nMe: \"The Mature date of the loan is 10/13/27, that is what you will add at the End Date field, so your automatic payments will stop then”\n\nCustomer: \"Not to say you are wrong, but that doesnt sound right, I took the loan for 5 years, and I opened this loan last year, how can it be done in 2027?\"\n\nMe: ...ummm…\n \nCustomer: “I mean its simple math right?!, I took the loan in 2022, how can it end in 2027? Its 5 years bro, are you stupid or what? Look 2 + 5 equals...ooooh nevermind\"\n\nMe: *with a big smile* “is there anything else I may be able to assist you with today?\n\nCustomer: \"Nope, im embarassed enough, thank you” *click*",

        "text": "Like the subject says, I work for my state's Homeless Hotline.  Homeless people call us and we either refer them to an agency that can help them, or get them into a shelter, warming center (if it's cold out) or a motel if nothing else is available.  Obviously everyone wants the hotel option.  Today's reason for \"why I can only go to a hotel....\"   \"Sometimes I lose control of my bowels and I'm sure the shelter doesn't want it running down my leg all over the floor\".  I've also had hotels tell me things like \"She can't stay here again because last time she tried to sneak a St Bernard into the room\".  Most of my tales range from WTF funny to so depressing that my breaks are spent with my head down taking deep breaths.  But.... It's a living.",

Some jobs like my current one are excellent, and some like my last one were a piece of shit.\n\nWhat I have learned in all those years is The customer is NOT always right! Sometimes you have to have the attitide of I’m either going to treat you like a person and bend over backwards to help you if you’re nice, or you will get the very bare mininum attitude from me and treat you like a number until you hang up if you’re rude to me (not the situation) but me personally such as:\n\n1. repeatedly flat monotone sentences or words until you get frustrated and hang up, especially if you’re one of those people who won’t take no for a f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*g answer, or are just outright rude to me personally,\n2. If you swear at me (again I will allow swearing at the situation as long as it is not directed at me) that is an automatic warning and if it continues, then disconnection.\n\nAs for the callers always remember the number one rule in life: Treat others as you want to be treated!!!!",
