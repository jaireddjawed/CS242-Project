        "text": "It has been said, in opposition to the Epicurean idea of pleasure as an absence of pain--at least in one of its forms--, that pain can be pleasurable in some cases. Often in a sexual context, we are told that for some, the action of being, if we're to provide an example, hit in the balls gives somebody a certain pleasure. While we certainly may not deny that this is the case, we find that it isn't so much the pain itself giving the pleasure, but perhaps the psychological idea of being dominated by the one who is doing the kicking. That is to say, if we removed the physical pain and were left with the idea of domination, we would not only retain the pleasure, but increase it, because the physical pain is no longer. Thus, we have no reason to think that the relevant Epicurean doctrine is threatened, because not only has it not been challenged (as we've said that the pain itself is not a pleasure) but we've also demonstrated the veracity of the principle by simple inference; namely, by inferring that since the pain is indeed distinct from pleasure (only acting as instilling the idea of domination, thereby leading to pleasure, which is distinct from the pain), that the pleasure would increase provided the pain is not present. Whether the pain is really required to instill an authentic idea of domination is another thing (as hitherto I've worked only in hypothetical), and whether Epicurus himself would have approved of such actions is also another thing. Of the first, I cannot say much, as I am not an expert in psychology and its relation to sex, but of the second I am in a place to say much more. As being an early hedonist, Epicurus's principle doctrines gives us some type of framework whereby we can establish something as good, or something as bad. Principle 8 says:\n\n&gt; 8. No pleasure is a bad thing in itself, but the things which produce certain pleasures entail disturbances many times greater than the pleasures themselves.\n\nWhat we need to do now is rather simple. We must analyze the sexual actions in question and ask ourselves whether the pain of being kicked in the balls (which is, in itself, bad, as I've argued here above) outweighs the mental pleasure of being dominated. Is the pain so bad as to cause any lasting physical harm? How intense will the pleasure be? Will it lead to any other pleasures? These are all interesting questions that we ought to ask ourselves in perhaps all situations of our lives, and for a more in-depth look at the questions you ought to ask, we might point to later utilitarians (who developed more complex systems) such as Bentham for something called the 'hedonistic calculus': http://philosophy.lander.edu/ethics/calculus.html\n\nEdit: I thought it significant to mention that if the pain were a pleasure in itself, we would find that regular people kicking others in the balls would be pleasurable, but we don't, so clearly it's pleasure on a condition of the person, demonstrating that the pleasure is mental and distinct from the pain. Meant to include this in the thread, sorry.",

This could also create a framework for those [religious leaders](http://clergyproject.org/) who no longer believe in the gods of their religion but enjoy helping their congregation. There still needs to be teaching in ethics for our society and basing it in Epicurean thought could be a great step to improving human society. With the construction of actual churches it sends the message to the world that we are a part of this society and that we are here to stay. \n\nThoughts?\n\n\nedit: Also, I was thinking about the reading level of current Epicurean writings. To me they seem to be above the average reading levels, to have a wider religion would allow for the writings to become more accessible. \n",
