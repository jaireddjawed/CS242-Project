I've been doing a lot to prepare and one thing on my list was to apply for an absentee ballot so I can vote in the 2018 midterm. \n\nI go to the court house, application in hand, walk up to the elections official and say \"I'd like to apply to vote by mail\". The woman looks bewildered, asks me to clarify which election, and finally points me to a different desk. \n\nI explain what I want to do again and the woman (W) sitting at the second desk immediately rolls her eyes and scoffs \"well you can't do that until 45 days from the election.\"\n\nMe: \"I read that embassy workers, military personnel, and * my job * could apply earlier.\"\n\nHer: \"45 days, not 5 months. Call us 45 days ahead.\"\n\nMe: \"I won't have a US phone number, I can't call you.  Could you send me a PDF of the application now? Or could I give you my application now?\"\n\nHer (raises voice and rolls eyes): \"you want me to hold on to this piece of paper for 5 months? What if I DIE before then?!?\"\n\nAt this point I'm on the verge of tears because of how frustrated I am and by how rude this woman is being. She begrudgingly emails me the PDF, I tell her I'll figure it out, curtly thanked her for her time, and promptly left in silent tears. \n\nAs I was leaving, an employee who heard the entire thing came, took my application, encouraged me to put in another 45 days ahead, and apologizes for her co worker. \n\nSo, it all worked out and I understand that I was probably in the wrong for trying to apply 5 months early. I just wish I could have been corrected with some kindness. \n\nEdit: clarity and midterm (not general)",

        "text": "This is my first time posting here and I’m on mobile so sorry for weird formatting or whatever. \n\nMy sister and I went to a big chain grocery store to pick up a few extra things for a mother’s day BBQ that my mom was hosting. We picked up the few things we were sent there for, then decided to buy a sandwich to split as a snack. \n\nWhen we walked up to order our food, the lady ignored us for like 3 mins while actually not helping anyone else, then my sister ordered the sandwich that usually comes with avocado on it and she asked to just get it on half. This lady was so confused, like no one had ever asked her something like that in her life, and proceeded to loudly go “uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...ummm..” until my sister asked again to get avocado on half. \n\nThe lady proceeded to make the sandwich but kept asking us what it comes with because the big sign that says what comes on the sandwiches faced us, not her. We told her everything that went on it, and she still made it wrong (mind you it also took her like 10+ mins to make it). We didn’t say anything, after all it’s just a sandwich. We went to pay, and it’s the type of deli where they can ring up all your stuff so you don’t have to pay twice. This is where we had another problem. This lady started ringing our stuff and came to an onion we picked up for burgers. It’s produce so you have to have the code to type in. Apparently we grabbed one without the sticker that had the code. The lady starts going “uuuhhhhh..I can’t ring this up, there’s no code...” instead of like calling someone to help. We were like “okay, well we can just go up front to pay for all this stuff, no worries.” \nThe lady is like “actually... I already rang some of the stuff and I can’t void it out without calling someone to help, can you just buy this stuff here and go pay for the onion at a register?” \n\nAt this point, I’m reeeeeally trying to keep my cool, I work in a deli, I know some stuff can be hard if you don’t know how to do it but I always call someone else to help even if we’re really busy (they weren’t). I calmly ask her if we can please just take all the stuff up front to pay and she was like “Okay...yeah just take it and go up front and I’ll call someone to void it” \n\nWe go up front to pay and the lady at the checkstand was texting and chewing gum while ringing us up. \n\nTLDR: lady who worked\nat a deli didn’t know how to make a sandwich and tried to make us pay for some stuff at her register and some stuff at another register.

Well, something must have been off that day, because everything was completely out of order. Appetizer didn't come until halfway through the meal, I got the wrong entree, waiter only came over once or twice in the hour and a half we were there, the works. Naturally we talked to our waiter about it and he went and grabbed the manager. Dad was thinking, cool, maybe he'll take the kids meal off as compensation or give us a free dessert or something. Nope! Manager came over, apologizing profusely, and told us he was going to give us the whole 2 for $20 *absolutely free*. We ended up paying $5 for dinner for three at a decently pricey restaurant, and had leftovers for the next day as well. That's always stuck with me as one of the nicest things a manager has ever done, and my dad was taking about it for weeks.",

        "text": "So, I use a medical transportation service \\(I’ll refer to them as MTS\\) that’s provided through my insurance. I schedule rides online and they assign a driver to bring me to and from my appointments. I have three reoccurring appointments a week so I use MTS frequently.\n\nThere are a few different companies contracted through MTS and in the months I’ve been scheduling rides I have been assigned Company A, Company B and Company C. Company A and B are great. Clear communication about pick\\-up times and I’ve never been late to an appointment.\n\nCompany C is a different story.\n\nI’ve only recently been assigned Company C and it’s been frustrating, to say the least. Sometimes they call ahead with a pick\\-up time, sometimes they don’t. In the times they've been assigned, they have only gotten me to my appointments on time twice. I’ve been late multiple times and had to cancel one appointment all together because the driver was so incredibly late to pick me up—as in my appointment was at 1pm and after some back and forth it got to **be** 1pm and the driver was still ’10 min away’. I’ve spoken to a couple of representatives at MTS about the problems I’ve had with Company C. They’ve made notes in my file \\(they were witness to Company C being late to pick me up twice because everything is done through the MTS, so I had to call them to find out where my driver was\\).\n\nSo, yeah. I’ve been frustrated… and then Friday happened.\n\nI had an appointment at 11am on Friday. The night before Company C left a voicemail to confirm a 10:30am pick\\-up time. Friday morning around 10am I went out to the office in the garage. I like to be ready and waiting early on the chance they show up before the pick\\-up time. In the office I can sit down right by a window that looks out over the driveway. My dad had been in the office all morning and he left to see some clients around 10:15am. I was chilling in my chair, messing around on my computer and watching the driveway. It got to be past 10:30 and no sign of the driver. I shot over to the MTS website just to give my ride schedule another glance and it said my ride had been cancelled. Huh? I wondered if I had managed to cancel it somehow and panicked. I called MTS and the conversation went like this \\(I’ll be me and the representative will be CSR\\):\n\nCSR: Hello, \\(asks for my insurance ID, etc.\\) How can I help you?\n\nMe: I’m waiting for my ride and I just checked my schedule online. It says my ride was cancelled?\n\nCSR: Yes, you were a no show so the ride was cancelled.\n\nMe: …but they never came. I’ve been waiting for them since 10.\n\nCSR: Okay, let me contact the company.\n\n\\(Puts me on hold to call Company C\\)\n\n\\(Comes back a couple minutes later\\)\n\nCSR: I spoke with Company C and was told the driver arrived between 10 and 10:30. He waited thirty minutes and called you multiple times. When you never came out or picked up the phone, the ride was cancelled and the driver left.\n\nAs I said, I was within view of the driveway around 10am. My dad even drove out around 10:15am. There is no way a car sat out there for thirty minutes without either of us noticing. And absolutely no calls were made. The number they have is the office phone. Between 10 and 10:30 that phone rang three times, all were clients of my dad. I even double\\-checked the call log and the only time Company C contacted me was the night before, which was when they left the voicemail to say they would be here at 10:30am. Their story doesn’t make sense any way you look at it—even if they had somehow gotten the location wrong and were waiting at the wrong house, they still didn’t call so I could sort things out.\n\nI was upset at this point because my appointment was in twenty minutes and I apparently had no way to get there because I had been a no show for a ride that had never even arrived.\n\nI told the CSR that what Company C said wasn’t true but she couldn’t help me, obviously. She was just relaying what they told her. This wasn’t on her and all she could do was apologize and tell me at this point nothing could be done in terms of a ride. I don’t like confrontation or to be the person who complains, but I said yes when she asked if I wanted to file a complaint. She transferred me and I filed a formal complaint against Company C, but I don’t know if I communicated the situation correctly. The person I spoke to said she was submitting a complaint for Company C ‘never arriving for pick\\-up’, which is only part of it. I’m more upset that they straight up lied about having waited for me/having tried to call me. I’m hoping when they review the complaint they look at the notes in my file so they can see there’s been a pattern of problems.\n\nAnd unrelated but definitely something that made everything worse is that the appointment I wound up missing was with my psychiatrist. I’ve spoken to her before about the problems I’ve had with Company C—I have anxiety problems \\(blah, blah, blah I know\\) and two major things for me is that I don’t like upsets in my routine and I don’t like being late/cancelling last minute because I know I’m inconveniencing others and it’s rude. At least when I called the office to say I wouldn’t be able to make it to my appointment, the receptionist was very kind and when I explained what had happened she assured me it wasn’t my fault.\n\nThis is long, I'm sorry. I’m just frustrated and confused, I guess. I was irritated when they were late, but this time they weren’t even late… they just didn’t show up and then said they did. Why lie? It’s just weird and makes me worry they'll do it again.\n\nToday I scheduled my rides for this week and have been assigned Company C for Friday again. I called MTS to see if I could have a different company but the representative said my insurance plan doesn’t allow me to choose, I’m just assigned whoever is first available. So… idk. I don’t want to be a pain in the ass but the point of this service is to get people to their appointments and Company C is failing miserably.\n\n**TL;DR:** A company assigned to transport me to medical appointments sucks, is consistently late and most recently cancelled my ride all together and lied about having waited for me/called me.",

I was with my mom and while she was checking out I went to go get us frozen yogurts.\n\nThe line for the food court was super long since it was a Saturday around lunch time. I get in line and wait patiently. Then I notice this man who was moving pass the entire line, gets up to the register in front of the guy who was about to order and states....\n\nMan: Hi ma’am may I have a large drink \n\nCashier: Sir it is not your turn you have to wait in line like everyone else.\n\nMan: But that makes no sense because I don’t want food I just want a drink.\n\nThen he begins to take one of the drink cups and puts his hand all over the rim and on the inside. Pretty much unusable at that point. \n\nCashier: Sir! You have not payed for that! if you want a drink you have to wait in line like everyone else! \n\nMan: I have to wait in that really long line I just want a drink.\n\nOnce he realizes this lady isn’t going to budge he huffs and shoves the cup back to the cashier and saunters off to the back of the line. \n\nI have never seen anyone more entitled and oblivious in my life and I hope to never see someone like that again.",

        "text": "TLDR at the end\n\nSo this is a bit long, and although I worked in the industry for several years this one comes from the perspective of a customer.\n\nSo I was lucky enough to spend a Summer abroad in England for school, and although the courses were only for six weeks, I took the opportunity to bum around the island for another month or so with my girlfriend. We could only afford so much, so we tried not to eat out, but one night she was feeling extremely homesick so we went to an authentic Szechuan place. We got some tea, put in our orders, the ambience was great, seemed like a good night, then boom, the power went out.\n\nLittle did we know that the city we were in was about to experience 48 hours of rolling blackouts, but when it became obvious the power wasn't coming back on, our server started making the rounds and damn she was amazing. I could tell other tables weren't responding to the news well and she was catching a lot of flak, some people were even throwing their napkins on the table and storming out, but she was still able to maintain her cheerily apologetic tone when she got to us.\n\nApparently, our orders hadn't been fired yet, and they were unable to make any more hot food because of the kind of range they had. Along with a borderline excessive amount of bowing and apologizing, she quickly offered us cold appetizers with similar flavor profiles to our orders at half price by way of apology. We accepted, largely because of her attitude and not wanting the night to be a total loss. Of course, I'm disappointed with the wasted night and my girlfriend is upset at not getting some home comforts, but the appetizers were actually spot on so we try to make the most of it.\n\nBut then lo and behold a miracle: our original orders come out! When our server announced our food was ready she was positively beaming with pride, my girlfriend was thrilled beyond words, and I was seriously impressed if a bit confused. I asked how they prepared it and she said something along the lines of, \"I have no idea how but the chefs were able to pull something together for the customers who didn't leave!\"\n\nAfter a few minutes she brought out a few paper lanterns she was able to find so we had some light, and we ate a damn delicious meal, \"Almost as good as my aunt can make,\" according to SO. Our server was an absolute gem all night, hit the perfect balance of attentive but not overbearing, she was patient and helpful and kind even though she was going through the trifecta of angry customers, BoH/technical insanity, and a nearly empty dining room. She seemed close to tears when my girlfriend told her how great our experience was in Mandarin. But I had some kitchen experience and I just HAD to know. I asked the server if I could personally thank the kitchen and since the place was pretty much dead she brought me back.\n\nI was dumbfounded. Tucked into each burner on the range were three or four sterno cans for the lower-heat cooking, and for high-heat they had pressed into service a two-top wood burning stove in the corner that looked like it came with the 200 year old building. For fuel they were breaking down wooden delivery crates and wine cases. They had been turning away prospective customers at the door, so all of that was for the twenty-odd customers who had ordered and elected to stay after the power outage. Probably violated a dozen safety codes but DAMN that is some commitment!\n\nOf course, I was pretty broke, and wasn't expecting to buy (half price, but still) appetizers, so I couldn't leave much for a tip. I know tipping isn't as much of a thing in Jolly Old, but they sure as hell deserved it, and I remembered them when I got back home. After recouping the vacation losses I called a gift delivery service and arranged for a few nice-ish bottles of wine to be delivered to the staff along with a thank you note. Never heard back directly but that weekend a picture of the staff raising glasses of wine showed up on their Facebook.\n\nTLDR: power went out, they couldn't make hot food, SO and I disappointed, but then kitchen jury rigged a wild solution and cooked our food anyway, and our server was magnificent throughout.\n\nI want more stories like this! What's the furthest y'all've ever seen a restaurant go for customer service?",

Name rhymes with Client. Anyway a few weeks after she started working there a lot of calls started coming in about new self checkout registers being down. Now if you've used these registers you'd know they are the biggest hunks of shit and the company spent a LOT of money replacing all the registers in our area unnecessarily. Luckily our grocery store which just so happens to be right at the edge of our neighborhood did NOT get these terrible registers and we still had our trusty Fujitsu ones. Until this past weekend.... We got ALL new registers. Not just the U-Scans the actual normal checkout lines got the shit registers too. Now I know what you're thinking, \"Oh they couldn't be THAT bad\" Well guess what you're god damn wrong. The day after these Devil Machines were installed our family needed groceries so my mother stopped after a long day of work and went inside. After getting all the groceries and going through the checkout process she put her Debit card in the Devil Machine and it said \"Accepted\" Right then and there the register crashed and rebooted. Right AFTER she paid. It didn't even have time to print the receipt. Well my mom tried to voice her concern to the lady who watches over the self checkout but she wasn't having it. She demanded proof my mother paid even asking for her to show her proof from her banking app. Of course it didn't show right away so my mom paid a second time. This time in cash. The second she walked in the front door of the house the bank transfer went through. She went back Sunday and after some arguing got her money back. :)\n\n\n\nEdit: [Here's a picture of the exact same shitty register](https://imgur.com/MGxnEWU)",

Dying to try it, my family decided to order online and pickup as a to-go order this time around. \n\nMy dad gives me his card and asks me to go pick it up. I get there, breeze past the line, and go to the pickup counter. The cashier puts 2 giant bags on the counter and I hand over the card. He swipes it and hands it back. I started grabbing my bags to leave and he tells me “oh wait, you still owe 30 cents”. \n\nConfused, I ask how could this be. He responds with well there probably wasn’t enough money on that gift card. Still confused, I tell him it’s a debit card. With an attitude, he tells me there must not of been enough money in your account so only went through for what you had. Knowing my dad probably had more than $45 in his bank account, I asked the cashier again to double check because that just didn’t make sense. Annoyed he insists I still owe 30 cents. Whatever here’s your .30. Then I get my receipt. \n\nThe receipt he gives says nothing about the food. The receipt only says “gift card-add” for .30. I bring this to his attention and he tells me that’s just what happens with partial payments. I insist something must be wrong but he blows me off and keeps telling me it’s fine. \n\nSo fine. I take the food and leave. I get home and tell my dad what happened and he calls his bank to verify. The restaurant never tried to charge his card and there were enough funds. But then he begins to worry about the cashier stealing his card info. \n\nSo I called the restaurant and ask for a manager to verify. As I suspected, my order was showing as never picked up. I offered to actually pay for the food over the phone but she was very nice and insisted it was their mistake and there was nothing to worry about. Their cashier must have hit the wrong button and sold me a .30 gift card instead of closing out my order. \n\nI feel bad that he may have gotten in trouble. But I tried to bring it to his attention and he just blew me off. \n\nFood was amazing though. I see why the line is out the door. We will be back and paying for the food this time.  \n",

        "text": "We live in an old house, built in the 50s. Were veeeery slowly doing the nessary upgrades tha come with the joys of home ownership, the last lot so far being parts of the roof and guttering. Literally 2 years ago the downspouts *fell* off so after the last contractor bailed ( after accepting the job, told us 2 months later didn't have scaffolding to do it grr, you *don't * need scaffolding actually, just a big ass ladder) I chased down a semi local business to get the guttering replaced. No big issue, he came out, did the measurements and said he'd email me a quote.\n\nNow, due to a fuck up with a previous insulation installer, I needed an itemised invoice so I could claim back a roof flashing repair. We needed some guttering mounting fixed and 20m of guttering replaced . The quote stated all the above but and came in to about 2.5k ( reasonable) but nothing was priced seperately. When calling them back to give them the go ahead, I told them again I need it prices itemised and they promised to do it on the final bill. Alls good, they start in 2 weeksish.\n\nThe week proceeding I get a few calls organizing the colour as grey comes in 4 shades ( damn, who knew?) Get that sorted and 2 weeks later this nice guy pops in and gets started. Works 6 hours the 1st day and the wood side holding the guttering actually doesnt need to be replaced, its solid it just looks bad and Im going to repaint anyway so he said I'm not going to being charged, great!. Next day he works for 5 hours and all done! Neat! He's done a really good job too. Impressed I ask if he can give us a quote on gutterguard (those fucking tree flowers, seriously) and whacking some corrugated iron on a 6m×5m patch of area of roof framework that I want covered. He says he'll get back to me as he has the measurements. All good so I wait for the invoice which is supposed to come in 2 weeks. Never comes. This is where it gets pear shaped. Miss communications begin galore.\n\nI decide to give them a little more time and behold! We get an email invoice! Only it has OVERDUE stamped all it. Already annoyed I read it. This is where I get angry. Not only have they NOT taken off the gutter mounting, they haven't individually priced everything like I asked. I also notice that they are charging for 15 hours of work, which is bull but it's down from the 18 on the original quote. Confused and annoyed I call them and get the head tradesman running the business. I ask whats up with the late notice and why aren't the jobs individually priced? Oh and your guy was only here for MAX 11 hours so what's up with that? Keep in mind I'm female and I'm actually being sweet on the phone, not yelly. He's a mumbler and says this is the average quote for a average house and plus you have travel time to and from the job site (hour tops grr). His *tone* I cannot convey properly. I will in a second. I mention that he knew this was a small house and he cut me off and right then I said thanks for your time, bye, and hung up. I relayed this to the MALE homeowner who goes red.\n\nI hand my phone over and he calls him and rips in to him. Both were talking so loud that I could hear that tradies tone was waaaay more conciliatory with him than he was me and tradie actually explained *properly* what had happened and apologized for the fuckup with the late and incorrect invoice and promised to send out a corrected one (sexist much yeesh). Within 30 minutes I had it in my inbox and it was paid the revised 1800 next day. Icing on the cake he sent a compliance certification to show he was government up to scratch because male homeowner scared him so much.\n\nOut of morbid curiosity and well, the other guy did a very good job, I called a few days later to ask if he got the money and an update on the quote for gutterguard and roofing. He was surprised it hadn't gone though, methinks they have a serious bookeeping issue and surprised I'd called back, and promised to resend it.\n\nIt was for 4k. *blink* just got another quote, it was for 2k. Nice fuck off quote there.\n\nOh and we never got the individually priced items on the invoice so we had can't be reimbursed for the flashing job, sigh. Luckily it was around a 100 bucks so nothing to throw a shitfit over but still annoying.\n\nAh, the joys of home ownership.\n\nETA Update. Just got the gutterguard and the roof done with extra flashing. Everything, including materials and labour, $920 dollars. All done with 1 ladder and 1 tradie. Definitely a fuck you quote, sigh",

        "text": "Today, for Mother's Day, my dad decided to pick up some food and bring it home instead of cooking or going out to eat. My mom wanted Italian, so we chose a popular chain that we hadn't been to in a while due to its expensive prices. Due to my family being a family of 7, we ordered a lot of food. This Italian restaurant has giant, thin paper bags. They decided that they could fit our large amount of food in one bag. They also didn't double bag it, even though Italian food is really heavy and the bag was filled to the brim. My dad was more concerned with getting the food home in a timely manner than the weight one bag could hold. It was our fault for not asking, but still, using only one paper bag filled to the very top with heavy food is their normal? So, my dad got it into the car safely and drove home. As he picked it up to take it inside, however, the handle completely snapped off. Half of one of the pasta dishes spilt onto the driveway. Luckily, all the other food was safe. Due to it being our fault for not asking for it to be double bagged, I could just be a little annoyed and leave it at that. Except, there were other problems as well.\n   \n  As previously mentioned, we ordered a fair amount of food. When we unpacked everything that wasn't currently spilt on our driveway, we discovered an error. They had forgotten to give us the 2 big salads that came with the combos we ordered. Maybe they were so concerned with fitting everything into one bag, they forgot about the two things that wouldn't allow this one bag thing to work? My dad decided to call the restaurant to talk about the missing salads and the broken handle. The manager there told him that they had literally just switched over to using the bag they gave my dad, since the other ones kept breaking as well. I wonder why...\n      \nOn the bright side, they gave us a $50 gift card (this is a pricey chain, so the food lost was expensive). My dad also said the manager was nice.",

        "text": "My father had asked about a week ago to book a table at a local restaurant for Mother's Day (I'm Australian) to surprise my mum. I live on the other side of the city from my parents, and wanted something a little bit different; they live in a suburb with predominately Asian restaurants. I'd found a few places here and there, mainly by the bay, which means seafood. I ended up going for one of my dads recommendations, a seafood restaurant along the pier. \n\nI didn't realise until after I'd booked that they required a deposit on booking, as it was a set menu. Fair enough, it was a high class restaurant, $95 a head, including entrees, mains and dessert. I called up to clarify, when I was told by what I presume was a member of wait staff (servers, for you Americans) that they required a full payment ahead of time. Being 21 years old, working hospitality myself, didn't have the funds to pay the entire thing myself. I told them I'd call back, and get my dad on the phone to call and pay via credit card. Obviously, he had a few questions regarding the full deposit - what if something went wrong? What happened if they were out of a particular ingredient or the service was rubbish? He was transferred from the server to the manager, who insisted that nothing could possibly go wrong, and that everything would be completely fine and up to standard. \n\nShe offers to go check if they have any bookings available (although I had already made a booking previously). Meanwhile, the co-manager picks up the phone, greeting my father with a 'Hey pal, look, we're having none of this attitude from you, we're cancelling your booking,' complete with profanities. At this point my dad has had enough, and tells them to get stuffed, he doesn't want their business and is going somewhere else. \n\nI find another restaurant in the local area, a cosy Spanish place, tapas, paella, cocktails, the works. Obviously at the last minute, we can't get a table until 2:30pm. All fine with us. We get there, and the service is wonderful, our entrees are out in under 10 minutes, despite it being a busy holiday, the wait staff are attentive and lovely, and the food is incredible. We spent a while there, but as my dad goes up to pay (he's one of those awful bad-joke middle aged guys who's never worked hospo in his life), he tells the manager about the awful customer service he received from the seafood place earlier (my family is groaning with embarrassment at this point), and hands the gentleman at the counter a $100 tip. As awful as he can be, I'm so glad he recognised the wonderful food and service we received, and I'm definitely going back there again.   \n\nEdit to add: in Australia, most servers earn roughly $18-$25 hour, and generally there isn't a tipping culture at all, except in particularly exceptional circumstances.

This happened a few years ago when I was working at a big blue box store thats name sounds like it would sell supplies for building walls. \n\nAnyway, I worked at this store, but I was technically the customer because I was on my lunch break. I decided I wanted to order some chicken strips from the deli to eat on my lunch. I walked up to the counter and said: \"I would like three quarters of a pound of chicken strips please!\" She just stared at me really weird for a few seconds, and then put some chicken in the bag and gave it to me. \n\nI didn't notice something was wrong until I was eating my yummy chicken in the breakroom. I realized I only had about half the chicken I usually get. I checked the bag, and she had only given me just over 0.3 lbs of chicken. \"I know I told her three quarters of a lb, why did she only give me this much?\" I told myself. And then it hit me. The weird look, the small amount of chicken; the Deli Lady didn't know what three quarters was. She heard three quarters and thought 0.3. \n\nThe next time she was working, I ordered the exact same thing just to test me theory. Yup. 0.3 lbs. Did she just skip out on math class in high school or something?! Lady, you are a living stereotype of a store you would think would sell \"wall\" supplies.\n\nEdit: changed 3 to three to make it easier to understand. ",

He does some things, and it turns out that our heater is leaking carbon monoxide like a mofo, and our heater is kaput.\n\n(Mini-lesson: carbon monoxide is a transparent, odourless, poisonous gas that will kill you in your sleep).\n\nAs a result of this diagnosis, Person A whips out some scissors and cuts the plug off the heater and pockets it, and takes the knob that controls the gas. I am assume this is so I don’t use the heater - fair enough.\n\nI am sad, but I send husband a message the plug was literally pulled on the heater, and we’d better figure out a way to heat our house.\n\n*EIGHT HOURS LATER*\n\nI get a call from someone who works at the same place as Person A.\n\nPerson B says he is sorry he missed seeing the report on my heater, and that he will come back after the weekend to recheck it, as dust can cause a bad reading (and Lord, how my heater was covered in dust - I hate vacuuming).\n\nI reply that he might have trouble as there is no plug.\n\n“That’s OK”, he replies. They are easy to replace.\n\nI explained myself - the plug was cut off with a pair of scissors.\n\n“Oh”.\n\nSo now, on one of the coldest weekends in my state we have no heating, and at least a week’s wait on getting new heating installed (if the Gods of spare cash smile on us).\n\nI’m not even mad. It’s so stupid it’s funny.\n\nEDIT: Regardless of whether or not we have a carbon monoxide detector, we would still have had the heater checked, and according to Person B, it would have still possibly shown an incorrect reading\n\nAs some have pointed out, I am not in the US, so we don’t have the same rules and regulations regarding electrical work.\n\nAlso, the plug is at the exact right height for a curious toddler to fiddle with it, so I am not going to trust my untested plug-wiring abilities.",

Lady said it was cancelled and I was good to go. \n\nI return it to the store that evening, and they told me to check my bank statement to make sure the return went through. I pulled it up and there were too refunds. One was from earlier in the day and one was from right then. I told them about it because I didn't want the employee to get in trouble, and they told me that they really couldn't do anything there, and I'd have to call in. \n\nI call in, and at this point in the night I got someone from India, which is understandable. I explain that I got refunded twice, and I just didn't want anyone to get in trouble. This woman insisted that everything was correct and the were no errors. I explained the situation about 3 times before I decided that I had done my due diligence and hung up. \n\nTL;DR: Big Retailer gave me a free fridge.",

        "text": "My husband and I had a delightful dinner one night at a hotel restaurant that had recently opened.  Being parents of young kids, we were out early so our baby sitter didn’t have a late night, and were the first table to be seated that evening.  Our young server was enthusiastic and friendly, though she seemed a little inexperienced.  She laid out our menus, took our drink orders promptly, then attempted to rattle off all of the specials of the night.  \n\nAbout halfway through describing the first dish she stumbled, and with each mistake she grew more flustered.  We did our best to convey encouragement in our smiles and eye contact.  After all, we’ve all been new to a job at some point.  That’s when a lightbulb seemed to go off.  She quickly stepped away, then came back carrying the specials board so she could just read the details to us.  \n\nThe comically large, A-frame, two-sided specials board.  \n\nFlawlessly she read through the first side.  Then she heaved that enormous board up, turned it, placed it down and read through the second side.  She let us know she would give us a few minutes to decide while she organised our drinks.  Away she walked, leaving the specials board still positioned at our table.  \n\nYou know that feeling when something sets you off, even if everyone else around you is playing it cool, and every time you think of it you can’t stop yourself giggling?  \n\nI couldn’t even look at this specials board, though it’s imposing presence made it hard to ignore.  Every time I glanced its way, a little chuckle would try to escape.  Eventually though the server came back, took our orders and to my relief I made it through with a straight face.  I even managed to order from the specials.  Then she tucked her pencil and order pad into her apron, hauled that specials board up, and promptly set it down next to a newly seated table across the room.\n\nThe meal was fantastic, the service carried out with unwavering enthusiasm.  And that larger-than-life specials board enjoyed the company of just about everyone in the restaurant that night.   \n",

I’ve gone the last two years in a row and the line is always out the door. I’m on maternity leave this year, so decided to take advantage of that and beat the teacher crowd so I got there around 2. I had a pleasant conversation with the first woman that began building my burrito, then I got to the check out. \n\nThis woman seemed like she had no interest in being there and didn’t respond to my smiling “hello”. This is fine, we all have our off days, no problem. As she rang up my order I said “oh, I’m a teacher” to get my discount. I held out my phone to show them my emailed direct deposit pay stub like I have in the past. She rolled her eyes and looked at her manager who hesitated as she thought what to do since I didn’t have a school ID. (My school doesn’t give them. I never had one. I don’t know why.) Neither of them had any interest in actually looking at my phone, which had my name, and said “XXXXX school district” directly on it. I even had to be THAT customer and say, “they’ve let me every other year.” \n\nThey questioned me (still without bothering to look at my phone) about what school I taught at, and they were skeptical about why I was there during school hours. I gestured towards my belly and explained that I’m on maternity leave and wanted to beat the crowd that I witnessed the past few years. \n\nWell, they ended up giving me the deal but I felt like such a nuisance. I understand that their rule is to provide a school ID, but why can’t we use an alternative, valid, proof if our school doesn’t provide us with one? I’m a teacher! I deserve to be appreciated on this day too! \n\nAnyways, my burrito was great. ",

(Today, as you can all see down there on your task bar, is May 8 - or 8 May if you're in most of the world.)\n\nI hand over my paper scrip with my driver license. The tech behind the pharmacy counter peers at the scrip, blinks, says \"What is your name?\" OK, well, you're holding my license in your hand but fine, my name is *notkarendonner*.\n\nShe puts both scrip and license down, types for a few minutes, then shoves the scrip back at me. \"I can't fill this\" and turns away.\n\nHold up. Why not?\n\nDeep sign from her. \"You can only get it every 30 days.\" OK, well, when did I last fill it? \"On the 11th. So you have to wait 12 days.\" Heavy overtones of *take that you drug-scamming scammer.*\n\nI'm not the best mather in the world, but ... no. By this time, she's turned her back again, so I start trying to get her attention. No luck.\n\nThe pharmacist, whom I actually like (if he took off the white coat, he'd be right at home at a Grateful Dead concert and is usually a cheerful guy) has been watching. He snaps out the tech's name ... let's say it's Lizzie, cause it's not. She gives him this flirty, conspiratorial little grin. He shakes his head and comes back over, takes the scrip from me, looks it up himself then very apologetically says \"I really can't fill this until Thursday. The state's cracking down.\"\n\nI point out that it's a different (actually lower) dosage. Well, yes, that does change things. He says it will be ready in about two hours.\n\nFrom the huffing that ensues, Lizzie is outraged. And clearly not paying a bit of attention as the pharmacist tries , with a here-we-go-again air, to get her to comprehend that between now and Thursday there are actually fewer than 12 days. And that yes, he does understand and is following the law.\n\nOnce the show is over, of course, I have to get her attention again. Finally: \"WHAT?!\"\n\nMy license. You still have it behind the register. \"FINE!\" And she tosses it at me and turns again. As I walk away, I hear the pharmacist, who is just about on his last nerve:\n\n\"**Lizzie!**\"\n\nHoney, it's a good thing you're pretty.\n\n(EDIT for TL:DR - Pharmacy tech misapplies the rules, can't do second-grade math, gets her flounce derailed by exasperated boss.)\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Back story \\(this will be important later\\): My family has bad circulation and that was passed on to me. For the most part, you can’t tell. The worst affect is that when I am not wearing make\\-up, I have dark\\(er\\) circles under my eyes. They are not even bad, and I am a fairly attractive lady, but I am self conscious about it and always trying to improve my care regimen.\n\nOne particularly lazy day, I went to work with zero make\\-up on. I normally wear natural make\\-up, so it wasn’t a huge difference. One of my innocent coworkers told me I looked tired. I lol’d it off, but inside I was screaming ‘Fuuuuuuuuu!’ and got a little insecure inside.\n\nI was still feeling kind of lazy when I went into Big Company That Sells EVERYTHING after work. I was also feeling frugal. In my head I was thinking, ‘Would it be cheaper to buy vitamins to help my blood circulation or buy foundation?’\n\nWell decided that the vitamins would be cheaper and healthier for me in the long run, but for the life of me I couldn’t remember which one it was \\(FYI it is B6\\)and didn’t have my phone on me to look it up. So I decide to ask the pharmacist. I speak directly to him and this was the head honcho \\(Hh\\), not one of the assistants.\n\nHh: How can I help you?\n\nMe: Sorry to bother you, but I am looking for the vitamin that helps with blood circulation.\n\nHh: I am not sure what you mean…\n\nMe: The dark circles under my eyes are getting worse and there is a vitamin supplement that helps with blood circulation, but I don’t remember which one it is and did not bring my phone to look it up. I was wondering if you could help me with this?\n\nHh: I don’t know what vitamin you are talking about but most people try sleep.\n\nI was appalled, baffled, and now… apprehensive. I didn’t know what to say.\n\nMe: You know, never mind, I will look it up and come back.\n\nHh: Maybe do that after your nap.\n\nI walked away turning red. I felt humiliated. My confidence was already down, but that was a low blow to anyone’s esteem. Fellow Redditor’s, I know that if I asked my peers they could honestly says I am a 5/10 no makeup, 6\\-7/10 natural makeup and I can be a dime if I deck myself out. I don’t use drugs or \\(rarely\\) alcohol; I am in my mid\\-30’s, and take care of my body. If I do drink, I am still ID’ed and get a look of surprise when they see my age.\n\nI try not to let him get to me and I move on to the isles. As you know, Big Company That Sells EVERYTHING is always moving things as soon as you get comfortable finding them. So, in the body care isles I can’t find an item. I see an associate \\(Ass\\) stocking a shelf and the exchange is as follows:\n\nMe: ma’am, it seems Big Company That Sells EVERYTHING has moved some items around. Can you help me find the bath salts?\n\nAss \\(shoots her head up and glares at me with the dirtiest look you can imagine\\): Excuuuuse me, but WE DO NOT sell THHHAT stuff HERE!\n\nMe \\(knowing what she misunderstood\\): Sorry, you know, the Epsom Salt?\n\nAss: That’s the food isle across the store. THIS is the health care isle.\n\nI’m confused. I walk around the neighboring Isles, I know I am close, all of the bath stuff is staring back at me. I go back to her isle, she is still there, it must be here.\n\nMe: Ma’am?\n\nAss: I TOLD YOU, thisssss is not the ISLE you are looking for.\n\nI glance at where she is, defeated. Then… oh, yes THEN…\n\nMe \\(sarcastically, as I wedge between her and the shelf she is stocking and bend down\\): Excuse me\n\nShe huffs. I grab the Eucalyptus scented bath salts from the shelf below the one she is putting things on.\n\nI show her them and point to the TWO shelves of plain \\- scented bath salts; every type you can think of.\n\nMe: Herrrrre they are. Right here plain. as. day, BATH SALTS.\n\nShe was confused, but I was too exhausted to say anything more at this point.\n\nEdit: Changed wording to \"Big Company That Sells EVERYTHING\"",

We have nowhere to be. \n\nStanding fairly close behind the counter, obviously still restocking as fast as she can, is a young lady (YL).  YL has yet to make eye contact, we know she’s not ready to help us, so we are standing one or maybe two steps back from the glass so as not to be in her face. She’ll tell us when she’s ready! Please note, SO and I are fluent in American Sign Language, so we frequently just sign to each other in noisy places or whenever it’s easier than talking. So we’re happily signing away when enter from stage left, JF for Jerk Face. \n\nJF comes in from the back door, and instead of walking around to get behind us, comes down the food line and literally steps in front of us. To where we both had to take a step back to keep from falling over. And then he starts telling his order to the (CLEARLY still restocking) YL. She looks up, looks at us (we’re rolling our eyes at this guy, but not gonna cause a scene) and looks back at him. \n\nThen she smiles. I know that smile. It’s a beautiful thing. It’s the “sir, nice try but you are screwed” smile. \n\nYL points at us and says “I believe they were next.” Bigger smile. \n\nJF grunts or makes some other unhappy noise, hard to hear exactly what but it’s obvious he’s not saying “oh ooops my bad”. He storms behind us. We thanked her for speaking up for us. \n\nIt’s a little thing, but it totally made my day that someone wasn’t afraid of a bully, and didn’t let him get away with it. I don’t know if this guy thought we were deaf and that thusly he could take advantage of us, or if he was just a self absorbed annoying jerk face. Either way, YL, wherever you are, I tip my figurative hat to you. Your courage will take you far. ",

        "text": "This happened about a year ago at a big electronics retailer. I went in one day browsing for a new laptop, since my old one was breaking. I perused the options but wasn't planning on buying anything just yet. After I talked to one of the people there, I mentioned one particular brand I wanted that wasn't there. The person gave me an invite to their \"VIP Sale\" which took place on the Thursday before Black Friday.\n\nSo we show up to this \"VIP Sale\" and I go look at the laptops again, and they have the one I want. It's sitting there on the display table next to all the other ones for sale, and next to it is the price tag, the *sale* price tag, and the specifications. I tell an employee I want to buy it, and they go to get one for me.\n\nThey come back soon after and tell me that they're actually sold out of that one. Both in-store and online. I just gave him a befuddled look and asked \"Then why is it on display here?\" He gave me some answer that I don't remember.\n\nI browsed the other ones, now knowing in the back of my head that there's no way to tell if they'll have it in stock or not. (I'm not psychic after all). I pick out another laptop and tell the man I want to buy this one. He goes to check.\n\nThey are sold out of this one too. Both in-store and online.\n\nI left in a huff. What a misleading and frustrating experience. Afterwards I went to their website to find customer service so I could complain, but the only option they had for this was their discussion forums. I made an account, posted my inquiry, and waited. I waited, and waited, and waited, and finally a customer service rep replies saying they'll be happy to discuss the matter in a DM (I didn't describe the full details of my issue in the forum post). So I do, only for them to tell me \"Oh, we don't offer support in that area, sorry.\"\n\nI gave up and just bought a laptop from an online website named after a jungle in Africa.\n\nFor what it's worth, after I left their fancy \"VIP Sale\", I went to a different, smaller retail store that sells electronics but doesn't specialize in it. (They're basically a big drugstore). They didn't have anything I wanted to purchase, but the reason I bring this up is that they had the courtesy to put little notes next to some laptops saying \"SOLD OUT\". They were just barely a step above sticky notes, but they conveyed this vital piece of information to me.\n\nEDIT: Just to make things absolutely clear: I was not and am not complaining that the store was sold out, or that they had sold out during a sale (The laptops weren't part of the sale anyway, it was a store-wide sale on everything). My frustration was due to the fact that the floor models clearly indicated that these products were available and for sale, and there was no way for me to know they were sold out without having an employee go and check for me. (That's a waste of his time too, when he could be helping with the throngs of people) Oh, and also a bit of complaining about the roundabout customer service loop, but that's not really anything new after all.",

Because they were locked away we asked an associate if he could unlock it for us. Working in retail for years I know how locked away products work, you ask for them and then they are stored for you at the register. As he was approaching us to unlock the cologne he changed his mind and told us to make line first. But whatever. It didn’t make any sense to us since he walked to the registers and would have to walk back again. We finally made it to check out and we asked the cashier about the cologne we wanted. She said that the guy would unlock it for us. The guy was standing right by her acting like he was busy on his fucking clipboard. Me and my boyfriend look at each other confused because he obviously doesn’t want to help. He sighs and goes over with my boyfriend because he didn’t know which one he wanted. I stood with the girl at the register and told her I had other stuff with me. It’s about 5 seconds when I realize this girl is staring at me. I look at her confused and say “oh I’m sorry was I supposed to go to a different register?” I was honestly confused. She stays starring at me with an annoyed look. “My boyfriend went to get the cologne” I reminded. This girl had the worst attitude for no reason. At this point she was still not saying anything so I asked her “are you going to ring me up or do I go somewhere else?” I tell her annoyed. “Don’t give me attitude ” she said.

So clearly a scam, I cancelled the transaction on E-site with the explanation that I would not be willing to be scammed. \n\nI received an invoice yesterday for a $12 fee because i sold my item through the site.

Also, I'm on mobile, so sorry in advance for formatting.\n\nSo, we are sitting at home, and we get a call. It's the cable company from where we got our cable box. They called and said, \"Would you like to upgrade to the new cable box? Because of our new plan we will do it for free. It connects all your cable boxes for recordings  (we had 2) and gives you more space.\"\n\nSo my dad is like, \"Okay, cool, let's do that. It won't cost anything extra?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Okay, let's do it then.\"\n\n\"So when should we come and install the security system?\"\n\n\"What? You never mentioned a security system. I don't want that.\"\n\n\"Oh, okay, I'll take that off. You'll just get the box then.\"\n\nSo, some time passes, and we get another phone call. Cable company again.\n\nThey asked when they should come over for the security system. \n\nMy dad again affirmed that he did not want that, and they said, \"Oh, okay.\"\n\nThen they called a third time. They said the same thing, and then proceeded to get in a two hour phone call about the security system.\n\nFinally, my dad got it across that he did not want a security system.\n\nOn top of that, it then took 3 months to get a new box.",

Only the self serve checkouts were open and there was this one guy at the checkout trying to buy beer. When buying alcohol from the self serve checkout you need the supervisor to approve the sale and this guy wasn’t getting that. I saw him swipe and shove his card in the eftpos machine but he wasn’t able to pay because he still didn’t get approval from the supervisor. Obviously he’s not successful so he just picks up the beer and starts to walk out the store when the person at the checkout next to him calls out to the supervisor and security guard that he’s trying to walk out without paying for his item. The guy then comes back to his checkout to pay. By this point I’ve paid for my items and leave the store. I assume the guy has now paid as I see him walking down the street when I’m waiting at the crossing. A few seconds later I hear a big bang and it turns out that guy has dropped his 12 pack of beer on the ground. All the bottles are smashed and the liquid is draining out as he attempts to pick up the box and try and save them. He then realises that they’re all a waste and just walks away from the mess.\n\nKarma I guess? 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️",

I also do not know how to link posts so I am sorry.\n\nRecap: Tried to pick up a pizza order I paid for and was accused of trying to steal said order, along with being insulted on my looks. THEN making my disabled Father come into the pizza place because a whiney valley girl had the IQ of a fucking turnip.\n\nSo it's been a few days, I think I posted on last Wendesday and forgot to update when it happened on that Friday, but alas, here I am.\n\nFriday morning, at about 10:30 Dad's phone rings. I don't hear much but then Dad summons me. So I emerge from my \"cave\" aka my bedroom with gaming set up that I never leave. So I wander through to our lounge room and just stare at him from the doorway without speaking, because he is on speaker phone. He waves at me in a kind of \"come sit down\" kind of way so I do and flop into the armchair with all the grace of a beached whale and raise my eyebrows at my Dad. He speaks and tells who ever is on the line that I am present.\n\nPhoneGuy (PG): \"Thank you for both speaking to me.\"\n\nDad (D): \"That's no problem. What would you like to discuss?\" Dad being all adult mode.\n\nPG: \" I would firstly like to apologise for the service you recieved at my establishment.\"\n\nI am guessing before I was summomed Dad told him that yes, we were the right people and yes he was my Father and I was his adult child. Apparently the owner, aka PG pulled my Dads number off the order and called Daddems. Dad told me all this info after btw but I just thought I'd explain earlier for dynamic.\n\nD: \" It wasn't me who got the worst of it. My Daughter on the other hand informed me that she was not only accused of stealing but her looks were brought into it. Which is unbelievable. How is that acceptable in any way?\" Dad is smart, good with words and can make anyone feel like an asshole. And that whole protective Dad thing had risen to the surface again. I don't say anything because anxiety and hating phone calls.\n\nPG: \"I know and I am so unbelievably sorry that she went through that\" (I'm assuming Dad told him I don't talk much but I am in the room) \" I apologise that someone under my employment treated two people so badly and that the manager on duty did not step in before more damage was done.\"\n\nAt this point I am giving the phone bitch face because heyooo, bit late bud. Dad has suffered and my anxiety was mental when I got home.\n\nD: \"Why I do appreciate the apology, as does my daughter. I feel like it isn't enough. I would never ask for someone to get in trouble, but that girl needs serious repecussions for her actions.\"\n\nPG: \"That is another thing I called to inform you about. That young woman was fired after I found out how you both were treated. She tried to say she was yelled at and you were both rude (Guys, you were RIGHT) so I reviewed the security footage and they matched the Manger story, so she had to be let go. The manager in question is also going through more training on how to deal with a rude staff members and upset customers in the future.\"\n\nI had to leave the room because my bitch ass was laughing a bit. SHE GOT DROPPED LOL, BITCH SUCK ITTTTTT. Once Dad got done being an adult on the phone I wandered back in. Apparently he gave Dad his personal number in case anything happened at that pizza store again, or at any in the next few towns over, apparently he owns a whole lot of the stores in my area. We also got $50 worth of free food for the next we go, which is $30 more then our order was originally. \n\nSo free food, bitch got fired, got the OWNERS number and the manager had to go through sensitivy training. We wonnnnn. Just thought you guys would want to know what happened.",

I told her I was a minor and she responded with \"well my son knows his Ssn and he's only 7\" and proceeded to tell me how my parents must be ashamed of me and how I'm obviously a failure. In hindsight I was a damn good student and well above national averages for my age but that shit really tore into me and my already low self esteem. I don't remember her name but I remember her face and the spittle and her double chin shaking. I'm over it now but at the time I was ready to hit her. I didn't because I was too weak to even lift my arms.

I've read a lot of car salesman stories on here, but just never thought I would experience that level of shadiness.\n\nMy car recently died, so my fiance recommended I use my day off today to go around, test drive some cars. This way, if I found one I loved we could go together tomorrow so he could do a second look and we could potentially purchase one. \n\nI was hesitant about going alone at first, since I've heard a lot of horror stories about car salesmen, especially on here. I'm 27, but look a little young, and I literally know next to nothing about cars. I feel like I could be seen as a pretty easy target. However, I found the exact kind of compact SUV I really like, at a decent price and decent milage, so that was my first stop. \n\nFirst off, the dealership was kind of sketchy. It shared a small building with a storage unit office. The cars were all parked on a dirt lot. Buuuut it had a lot of good reviews, so maybe looks aren't everything. I go in. 2 guys are sitting there. I mentioned I wanted to look at the SUV, and one of the men walked me out to it. \n\nHe recommended I test drive it, so I hopped in and started driving off. Right off the bat, the pedals seemed insanely sensitive, and as I hit the break for the first time I legitimately slammed my head back into the headrest. Ooof, but maybe it's because I'm used to driving an older SUV that isn't very sensitive. \n\nThen the red flags came. I was told there was only a tiny dent in the hood, and the power locks/windows on the passenger side wouldn't work but they would be fixed soon. However, driving down the road, the RPMs went up to 4 (it's a scale between 0 and 8) just to get up to 35 mph. Strange, but maybe it just needed to warm up? Go to hop on the freeway, the RPMs get all the way to 6.....the number literally right below the 'red zone.' Okay. That doesn't seem right.\n\nI went back to the \"dealership\" and mentioned my only concern was this RPM issue. I was assured it was perfectly fine, but it was a 4 cylinder instead of 6 so it just had to work a little harder. I don't know jack about cars, like I mentioned, but I have driven a *lot* of different kinds and it just didn't seem right. \n\n'Should they draft up the paperwork?' \n\nUm, I need to talk to my fiance first.\n\n 'Oh, no, it's a great car and won't last long on the lot!'\n\nNo, really, it 's a decision were making together and he wants to look at the car I choose also. \n\n'Your loss. It probably won't be here tomorrow, so I wouldn't bother coming back with him to look.'\n\nK, cool. \n\nI left, went to another lot that had the same kind of car, it drives smooth as fucking butter. And after explaining it to my fiance and stepdad, they think it had a transmission issue and the guys were trying to pull one over on me. I don't know for sure, but I do know I'm even more nervous to do anymore shopping around by myself. \n\nTL;DR, went car shopping by myself for the first time ever, drove my dream car, they tried to sell me car that very likely had a transmission issue and passed it off as it just having \"4 cylinders.\"",

The barcode is essential. You cannot collect your parcel without it. \n\nI get the email saying that my order is available for collection. Great! Except I don't have a barcode. I check emails, texts and my account. No barcode. Fuck. So I go to the shop anyway and the guy cannot give me the parcel because I don't have the barcode. So I call up the make up company for them to tell me they don't supply customers with the barcodes only reps. I am not a rep. I have no dealings with a rep at all just their own website. I tell them to cancel the order and refund the payment. They refuse to do this without me returning the package which obviously I can't do. The person on the other end of the phone cannot comprehend this, keeps repeating themselves and not listening. In my frustration I hang up and call back. The second person was no different. \n\nI have since emailed the company and  I am also claiming back the costs via a well known secure online payment system. The response is  that their delivery team will look into it and \"In the meantime, if you do receive your order then please get in touch to let us know.\" \n\nI'd love to know how I'm going to receive this order when it's locked away and I can't collect it. \n\nSorry for the long rant but this has really fucked me off as this was supposed to be make up for my upcoming wedding vows renewal and it's especially stressful as my husband has no idea about it.

I'm putting it out here for others because it's happening all too often and I'm deeply troubled.\n\nI took my dog in for a routine nail trim in a certain big box pet store that offers grooming. Not the one that has its own in house vet and wellness plan but their competition. Literally it nearly cost my dog his life had I not busted into the grooming salon.\n\nMy bulldog needed a nail trim and we were out running errands. Seeing that it was such a simple routine thing I decided since we had to go buy dog food I would get it done while we were there. Big mistake. The groomer left my dog alone on the table with her back turned to him, he slipped off the table and was hanging. In the few seconds it took me to bust through the door his tongue was hanging out, his eyes were bulging and he was barely breathing. I was absolutely horrified and immediately got him down and out of that death trap. The groomer was like it's no big deal you're overreacting he was fine. The manager wasn't there and I was forced to pay for the incomplete nail trim which I gladly did to get my boy to a vet. Turns out he dislocated his hip in the incident and also had a bruised trachea. A few months later he had a stroke more than likely from a clot that developed from the incident.\n\nI called management, corporate and even the VP of the company and got no response. Not even an apology for what happened to my dog. I had thousands of dollars in vet bills from this and they see it as no big deal.  I'm just glad I decided to wait outside the grooming area instead of going to grab his dog food like I was planning. If not my boy may not be here with me now.\n\nI urge all of the pet parents out there to do your due diligence when selecting someone to perform services on your animal. I made a mistake thinking he would be safe in this company's care for a routine visit. I still don't understand why for a nail trim you would put an 83 pound dog on a table for it when it's easier to do it on the floor. I also don't understand why if you have an animal in your care you would turn your back to them in a situation where you need to have control of the animal for both their safety and yours.  Please let my experience be a lesson learned and be very careful about who you trust with your fur kids",

My mother knows so much more because she’s been around race cars and other types of vehicles her whole life, because my grandfather did the same.\n\nAnyway, my car failed inspection. 2011 MIA Busan (Not real name, but... close). The Tie rod on my drivers side needed to be replaced and then my car realigned. My mom said that she would order the part and have it sent to... Small Bals (lewd? Maybe, but that’s the best thing I can name them). So I get my boyfriend to lead the way to... Small Bals and I follow him, since I didn’t know where I was going.\n\nWe get there, I talk to the guy, and he said my mom already set everything up. All he needed was the key and I would be able to get my car picked back up in a few hours. Great! Tie rod replacement AND realignment done in 3-4 hours?\n\nNope. Not at all.\n\nGuy calls my mom and says it’s done and can be picked up. She pays through the phone, me and my boyfriend go back to get my car. We both walk in and the first thing the dude says is “We actually don’t do realignments here. You’d have to go to the [Small Bals] down the way on [street that’s 30 mins away]\n\nOh... nice. Whatever. Anyway, he hands me my key, I go in my car, boyfriend gets in his car, and he starts to lead the way home.\n\nI drive out of the parking lot and I notice that when I’m going straight, my wheel is really cocked. Honestly... horrible.\n\nSee picture [HERE](https://imgur.com/a/kdqTsox)\n(If I need to blur out anymore info, let me know and I will) \n[Also, many people are down voting my last pic I posted because I blacked out the brand name for this sub. Don’t mind it LOL I reuploaded it hidden, so no worries. People were so butthurt and asking if I hated my MIA BUSAN. I don’t. I love my car so much! LOL]\n\nSo yeah, that was how I drove it home. If I tried to straighten the wheel out, I would be able to change lanes into the left lane. I felt like I was going to drift into the right lane, but I was actually driving straight the whole time.\n\nAnyway, I was distraught, being a new driver and all, it freaked me out. I felt that it was too dangerous. So I took a picture (the picture I submitted here, but of course, unblurred) and sent it to my mom, since she was the one paying for it for me. Thanks so much, mom. I love you LOL\n\nShe almost had a heart attack. Call it helicopter parenting or whatever, but “her baby’s safety is what’s most important” as she tells me and other people who ever cross her. She’s had different cars that she’s needed work on and even when they didn’t realign her car after, it NEVER looked that bad, from what she told me. Her cars, when worked on, not realigned, was only a smidge to the left or right. Not very noticeable, from what she said about her cars.\n\nSo anyway, she’s pissed tf off, calls the place, curses at the dude who spoke to me and her, telling him “YOU PUT MY DAUGHTERS LIFE IN DANGER” , and then she took my car to get it realigned somewhere else.\n\nThe only reason we went to that place was because they were a break shop. They could replace the tie rod AND (so we thought) get my car realigned, which the dude never told her they didn’t do. When she called them, she said “so my daughter needs a new tie rod and realignment” and the dude just said “Alright, that should be fine. We can get it done.” So no, he never said they didn’t do it. So... did he lead her on? I think so. Did she go over the top? Maybe, but I was distraught when I was driving, so I think I may have scared her more than I needed to LOL\n\nAnyway, it’s getting realigned now at a different place that ACTUALLY does realignments. I’ll report back in 20 more minutes if the car is better or if I’m using the steering wheel upside down now LOL",

Saying we were stupid and knew nothing about cars. \n\nHe almost hit a bulldog while test driving my car. \n\nHe lost a hubcap and the ring that went on my tire. Stuck the hubcap without the ring on and tried to get away with it. So I lost my hubcap (: \n\nHe complained about his job and his boss nonstop. \n\nAdmitted he NEVER looked at my car and just did the transmission flush. That he wouldn't look at the transmission because he wasn't paid enough. \n\nSo I went back to the dealer before we left and got a full refund. They charged me almost $400 to do a trans flush without even diagnosing what was wrong with my car. \n\nI talked to the manager who is going to have us email the dash footage, and assured me this wouldn't happen again. But I'm not gonna hold my breath. ",

        "text": " My first post was removed so I am reposting this. \n\nMy 25th birthday was in March and my awesome friends gave me a plane ticket to Milan as a present. The three of us are meant to leave in a few hours, which is 10:00 pm in my time zone. \n\nMy friend had booked a room at a hotel a month ago, received booking confirmation and all. \n\nNow, just a few hours before the flight our reservation gets cancelled out of nowhere. My friend called the hotel and had outrageous conversation with the front desk. Apparently, the guy yelled at her and basically said \"no room for you, there are other hotels\". Needless to say we were panicking and pissed off. \n\nI call the same hotel in an attempt to book another room last minute. Mind you, the website says there are rooms available!\n\nI called 12 times! Once he answered he would hang up just upon hearing English speech. When he eventually paid me the honor of talking to me, we had the following exchange. OI will be obnoxious Italian, Me is me. \n\nOI: Bueno \nMe: Hi, I would like to .... \nOI; ugh, madame, I already talk to you 8 times I told you I don't have your reservation ...\nMe: oh no, no, you haven't actually. I would like to ask if there are any rooms available \nOI: No... no room for you\nMe: so there aren't any rooms?\nOI: no ... DON'T LOSE YOUR TIME I DONT LOSE MY TIME WITH YOU ANY MORE. THERE ARE OTHER HOTELS. I AM NOT GOING TO HELP YOU. No room for you! \nMe: I see. Take care dipshit. \n\nSo if anyone is traveling to Milan be careful what hotel you book. This is the most disrespectful way I've been treated as a customer. \n\nWhat is really infuriating is that I am a very nice and patient customer. I have the sweetest voice on the phone, I'm not exaggerating lol reservations get lost I get that, but you don't have to be an asshole about it. ",

        "text": "I'll start by saying I'm from the UK. Back when I was 18, I had a little corner shop on my street, that had a lot of regulars and we all knew each other to have a quick friendly chat with. It just so happened I knew the family who owned the shop. I also went school with their youngest son. The mum, dad and 2 older brothers worked at the shop, the youngest brother I went school with didn't work there.\n\n\nOldest brother - OB\n\nGenius brother  -GB\n\nYoungest brother - YB\n\n\nI was in there most days buying bits and became a regular, so when it came to buying alcohol or cigarettes the parents would just serve me without asking for ID as they knew I was old enough. The family are lovely people, it was just GB. He had a massive chip on his shoulder and thought he was better than everyone else.\n\n\nThe YB had seen me in the shop one day, commented to GB who had just served me, that we was in the same year together. Me and the YB had a quick catch up and off I went. \n\nOver the next few weeks when I would pop in, GB would stand there eyeing me up when I would buy alcohol or cigarettes. He would ask his Mum or Dad are they not going to ID me, and they'd laugh him off and tell him they know I'm old enough.  I didn't think much of his comments at the time, because the government was pushing  stricter ID rules (such as think 25)\n\nNow and again GB would attempt conversation with Me, but it was strange. Stuff like \"you getting excited for your 18th?\" Or \"When's your 18th\" each time he would say that I would explain I'm already 18. One time he told me \"he knows the truth about my age\"  I ended asking him what does he mean\n\n\nGB- I know you're not old enough to buy cigs or beer \n\nMe - ... But I am. I'm 18.\n\nGB - You was in my YB year at school? \n\nMe - I was.\n\nGB- Exactly and YB is only 17. So you are aswell. \n\nIt makes sense now why this fool was telling his family to ID me and asking for my DOB.\n\nMe - No. I turned 18 a few months back, \n\nGB - YB is 17, so you are aswell. Its simple, my mum and dad go away soon and I'm running the shop so I won't serve you in here again until you show me it isn't a fake ID. \n\n\nI was annoyed leaving the shop, I could have shown him my ID again but I was being stubborn, and knowing what GB is like I knew he would not hand it back over because he was that convinced I was 17. \n\nI began timing to go into the shop when OB was serving, but GB busted me getting served and informed OB not to serve me again until I show GB my ID. OB told him that they've all seen my ID and I was in YB year. GB fired back \"yeah she was! And YB is only 17! She's using a fake ID\"\n\nYou could see the confusion on OB face at GBs logic of why I must be 17. OB shook his head and mouthed it's OK.\n\nI was getting fed up of GB and his little vendetta against me. That incident was the last straw, he had purposefully embarrassed me in the shop where other people watched on. I needed to do something about it. \n\nI went in one day when I knew it would be busy and when GB would be in the shop. Pottering round the shop I picked up a loaf of bread and a milk. Placing them on the counter, I smiled at OB. I slightly stepped to the side, so it was visible to people behind me what I had placed down. I acted like I was looking at the cigarettes.\n\nSure enough, GB speeds to the counter and tells OB he'll serve me. GB has this shit eating grin like he's finally caught me out. I'm still eyeing up the cigarette counter and a few people are behind me waiting. \n\nGB- ID please \n\nMe- What? \n\nGB- ID or I won't serve you. \n\nI begin to smile now, and GB shit eating grin is slowly turning into confusion.\n\nResponding loudly, so the people behind me can hear clearly\n\nMe- Didn't realise you needed ID to buy bread and milk. \n\nGB is silent. He realises I wasn't planning on buying cigs, I had just set him up too look a fool in front of the shop Like he had done with me. \n\nAnother regular who was behind me goes \n\n\"Jesus, I Didn't realise the government was cracking down that much with stuff you need an ID for\"  \n\nOB is grinning, whilst GB looks embarrassed and tells OB to serve me whilst he quickly retreated to the back of the store. As OB is tilling my items up another person pops up with \"Hey, OB I'm buying cat food. Will I need ID or...?\"\n\nI made a point after that, if GB was serving me regardless of whether it was age restricted products to casually say out loud \n\n\"Do you need my ID for this?\" \n\nSafe to say GB never asked me for ID again. I also like too think he learnt a valuable lesson, treat people how you want to be treated!\n\n",

They also act like I’m lying about getting sick when the script is changed because “that’s not how it works” (a.k.a. Not what they’re taught in pharmacist school). They also take me off the auto refill list as I “have a history of not picking up my refilled script”.\n\nBut again, this is all somehow my fault because I should magically know when the script is filled. \n\nThere is not a neat resolution to this, not until I switch pharmacies.

        "text": "Some background on this, my mom sent me on a run to buy some more dog food at a big box store. And from this tale and the stereotypes of employees and customers there, I think you may know what store this may be already LOL\n\nAnyway, I was holding this 50 pound bag of dog food in my arms (I looked like a little kid with a big stuffed animal or something. Some people even giggled when I was hugging the bag to me. It was massive) and I walked to self checkout. Because it was only one big bag, I didn’t want to wait in a line to checkout.\n\nAnyway, I approach the self checkout. It was busy that day and I was looking for an open kiosk to check out in. When an older Filipino employee (let’s call her Lola, grandma in Tagalog) kisses her teeth at me and says “OI!” And then points to an open machine. I smile, because I don’t want to start anything, and place the bag of dog food on the kiosk.\n\nI go to pick it up to scan it on the scanner. I actually never handled a big bag of dog food like this and I didn’t know that there’s scanning guns for this type of stuff, so I was trying to scan it by swiping it across the plate. It wasn’t working.\n\nThe Lola walks up behind me and says “OI! Use this!!!” In a very rude manner before picking up the scanning gun and scans it for me. I see her kiss her teeth and roll her eyes before she walks away again.\n\nAs I was about to pay, I hear a woman diagonal to me at another register asking a question about coupons to the Lola.\n\nWoman: So if I want to use a coupon, I can scan it here, right? (She was being very nice when talking to this Lola. I could almost hear a smile in her voice.\n\nLola: “... sure, sure, whatever. Just use it.”\n\nI was getting really annoyed at this Lola’s behavior at this point because she was being a jerk for no reason to these people.\n\nThe machine in front of me said “select payment type” and as I was going to push on the “Debit” card option on the screen, little old Lola runs over to me, screaming:\n\n“OI WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU’RE DOING?!”\n\nI was ticked off. Completely lost it. I looked at her, debit card clenched in my hand, and screamed back “TRYING TO USE MY DEBIT CARD!!!”\n\nShe walked away without a word and I was able to pay for the dog food and then left.\n\nI texted my mom about “this really rude Lola” who screamed at me and was being very rude to other customers. My mom told me that when her and my stepdad (also Filipino, I consider him my dad so I’ll call him dad for the rest of this) went to that same location for ‘after Christmas sales’, they had a problem with her as well. My dad proceeded to chew her out and said “You can’t treat people like this! What’s wrong with you?!” My mom called corporate right after it happened, but I guess nothing was done, because Lola did the same thing to me when I went in there a couple months after. Both my mom and dad decided to call corporate AGAIN after my incident.\n\nI walked in that store a week later to get what I needed and when I went to self checkout, Lola wasn’t there.\n\nI know that, well, how I was raised, we need to respect our older Lola’s and Lolo’s, but I couldn’t respect her. I do hope she got fired... LOL\n\nEDIT: Edited 15LBS to 50LBS because I got confused about the weight. Thank you so much to the person who cleared it up for me! :)",

        "text": "In December, my mother's house burned down, and my parents moved in with us. In January, my father died. My mother, who had the beginnings of alzheimers before this, swiftly began getting worse. She has frequent nightmares from the fire and loses touch with reality easily. She has difficulty remembering things that aren't constant in her life. As a result, going anywhere out of the norm is very confusing for her. \n\nMy husband and I brought her with us to a picturesque town in central Florida to find a new house that would fit our suddenly expanded family. While there, we stayed at one of the chain hotels in the area. \n\nOur stay had been going fairly well, we had found our new home, and we were staying one last night before heading back to our home. Some time during the night, my mother woke up. Normally I wake up when she does, but not this time. \n\nOne symptom of dementia is wandering. Another is regressing to a childlike state. My mother usually seems about 5 years old when she wakes up. \n\nUpon waking in a strange place, my mother was very confused and frightened. She didn't see me in the next bed and went wandering the halls. \n\nOnce outside the room, she forgot where the room was and the room number. She found her way to the lobby, presumably crying, and told the night auditor that she couldn't find her daughter. \n\nThe night auditor, understandably, could not tell her the room number, especially since my mother forgot my husband's name. However, both he and the gentleman at the breakfast area calmed my mother down, and offered her food. \n\nI'm not sure how long she sat in the lobby. I know when I woke up and she was not in the room, I panicked. I barely pulled shoes on before running out of the room to find her. I kept imagining her finding the outside door we were using to go smoke and wandering along the busy highway we were on. Even though the disease makes her hard to deal with sometimes, she is my mom and I am so not ready to let her go. \n\nAs soon as I entered the lobby, she jumped off the couch and began crying again. She kept telling me she thought I had left her. I hugged her and hugged her until she was calm again. We thanked the auditor and headed back to our room. \n\nAbout an hour later, we were dressed and ready to go get some breakfast. The breakfast attendant was outside when we walked out and came over to make sure mom was still okay. He talked to us for a bit and told mom he was glad she was better. \n\nAfter breakfast I thanked both the employees that took care of my mom, outside what is required of them. None of that is in typical hotel duties. I'm sure they thought it was no big deal, but to me they were heroes. I immediately left a glowing survey on their hotel site. I unfortunately didn't get the breakfast attendants name but was able to name the auditor. And now, in hopes one of them is a fellow redditor, I am sharing our story here. \n\nSo thanks, Dave and nice breakfast man! You were amazing and I really appreciate you taking the few minutes to talk to my mom and keep her safe. What was nothing to you is everything to us, and I wish I could do more than just a survey and a thanks.",

Accompanying picture if i figure out how to imgur\n\n\"So, I'm sitting in the food court at a train station in Chicago, and some guy sits next to me, eats about half his food, and literally starts making a mess. Purposely emptying condiment packages over his mess, dumps his Chinese food upside down, piles everything up, and gets up. I've watched him throughout this entire process, and when he gets up, just gives me this glare. An 'I dare you to say something' type of glare. \n\nSo I do. I ask him, if he's gonna clean that up.\nHe tells me no, because of the ridiculous prices on illinois sales taxes, which he informs me are at 11%.\n\nYes, I am aware, having lived in Chicago my whole life. I say that this station, and its employees, have nothing to do with the high taxes of the state, and his mess is just a mess.\n\nHe goes on a rant. He tells me to mind my own business, and that he served 28 years for this country, I should show him more respect. I disagree, because being blatantly disrespectful doesn't deserve respect. \n\nBasically from here it goes downhill (not that this was the pinnacle of human experience by now but you get me), and he tells me I'm disrespecting someone who served for this country, what have I ever done? \n\nI tell him, well f*ck, you're still an ahole. \n\nAnd because of our raised voices, a policeman comes to investigate. and makes him clean all that up. \n\nThe policeman tells me \"you gotta be careful around these crazy guys\" and i kind of storm off towards my train. And write this post because i was still so angry. \n\n\nSo just so you know, next time one of your employees finds a ridiculous, obviously intentional mess on one of your tables, it might be a silent protest for sales tax.\"",

        "text": "This story is from about a year ago, before the store in question closed suddenly in the middle of the day, but that's a story for later.\n\nMy boyfriend and I wanted some Zaddy Juan’s™ Pizza, and decided to order on one of the 50 percent off days. Naturally, we each get a pizza so we have lunch and dinner, and some chicken popplers, aka if popcorn chicken and nuggets had babies, these little fucks would be their glorious offspring.\n\nSo, we think nothing of it, and wait.\n\nAnd wait.\n\nAbout an hour after the order had been placed, we hear a cop knock. DG is delivery guy, BF is boyfriend obviously.\n\nDG: Zaddy Juan’s!\n\nBF: Just a sec.\n\nDG knocks again, as BF is about to open the door.\n\nDG: Got your Zaddy Juan's right here.\n\nBF puts the boxes on the counter, tips, signs the receipt and sends DG off with a nice tip.\n\nBF: That guy smelled like straight up weed.\n\nMe: Can't blame him. Gimme?\n\nI grab the Popplers box, and it feels not only really light, but uneven.\n\nMe: There's definitely not 30 in here.\n\nBF: Count them?\n\nMe: Fine.\n\nI count them twice, just in case, but 17. Not 30 by any imagining.\n\nMe: Yeah, that's 17. Call up Zaddy Juan's and get another 15 to make up for it.\n\nSo, BF calls, and Rude Bitch, herafter RB, picks up.\n\nRB: Hello,Zaddy Juan's. What can I do for you?\n\nBF: Hi, I just got my order and we're missing about half of the Popplers.\n\nRB: What was the rest of your order?\n\nBF: A large gross pizza, a large yum pizza, 30 Popplers and a coke.\n\nRB: Well, I packed those Popplers myself, I know I put 30 in there.\n\nBF: My girlfriend counted, and there was only 17.\n\nRB insinuates I ate half the box\n\nBF: No, I felt it was light when I took it, and I saw her count them. All she's eaten is a slice of pizza.\n\nRB: Well, I counted out 30.\n\nThis goes in a loop about 3 more times.\n\nRB: What do you want?\n\nBF is slightly taken aback, asks for more Popplers.\n\nRB: I can either refund you the price of the Popplers or give you a free 30 count Popplers next time.\n\nBF goes back and forth with her, trying to explain he just wants the whole order he paid for, and her repeating that she specifically counted out 30.\n\nAfter roughly 15 minutes of this nonsense going in circles, she finally agrees to send out more Popplers, immediately slamming down the phone after saying that like we're unreasonable.\n\n20 minutes later, another knock. OM is Obvious Manager.\n\nOM: Hey, sorry about that. Here's the Popplers, with two more cheese sauces.\n\nBF: Oh, thanks.\n\nBoyfriend grabs box, realizes it's a 30 count box.\n\nOM: Would you mind counting again?\n\nBF: Nah, no problem.\n\nBF counts, 30 exactly.\n\nOM: Have a nice day.\n\nThe OM sounded like it wasn't the only order he had to take, and was very polite to us, but seemed frazzled.\n\nBF: I wonder if PG got fired...\n\nEDIT: I'm an idiot and said Delivery Guy then PG for Pizza Guy.",

        "text": "This just happened today but I'm gonna give you guys some background. \n\n I went on a road trip with my boyfriend. We drove in my car from central florida, to Atlanta Georgia, to NoLA \n\nMy cars check engine and AT light came on why we were driving and I was having issues shifting. My cars an automatic if that matters. \n\nSo I don't know a lot about cars but my dad was a mechanic, and I know how to check the oil, transmission fluid, and a little more than average people do I guess. \n\nSo I schedule an appt at a dealership of my car brand for 9am. I pulled up to service station and they didn't even acknowledge I had an an appointment. \n\nOur hotel was pretty close to the dealer so I just dropped it off, and they said they would let me know in an hour after they diagnose it. \n\nNow I had the code for the lights that came on, I gave them an overview of what my dad thought was wrong but I get they have to check themselves. Reading the code is pretty easy takes 2 min whatever. One of the solenoids was stuck open and maybe I could use a transmission flush? \n\nSo it gets to an like 1pm and my cars been there for 3 hours so far. So I call them. No answer, I leave a message. 2 hours pass. Its 3pm. I call them again 3 times no answer. Whatever, maybe they're slammed. At 4:30 they call me back. They JUST diagnosed it. They want to change the fluid and see how that goes and they'll call me in the morning. \n\nOkay... Fine that's cool. We're supposed to leave on Thursday and tomorrow morning will be Wednesday so hopefully that's the issue and we can leave. \n\nNext day they don't call me all morning. I call, finally get someone and he tells me he has to check and will call later. Another 2 hours pass. Its 2pm. I get a call that I need a new transmission. \n\nThere was no, this is what we think is wrong,or  this is what happened, just \"so you need a new transmission and we can get one used or order it brand new.\" \n\nI'm like ok.. I JUST had my car serviced before I left to prevent this from happening. I call my dad he tells me he's sure I don't need a new transmission. To not buy anything, ask them what was wrong with it to warrant a new trans and to let him speak with the mechanic. \n\nI get to the dealer, talk with the service dude who tells me my trans fluid was motor oil black. Um... I've inserted 2 pictures so you can see what my trans fluid was and that it was okay.  When I stated this the Mechanic claimed there were shreds of metal in my fluid. All my gears were worn and my 5 solenoids were ruined. \n\nMy dad gets on the phone asks them all these questions and basically cuts out all the mechanics bullshit to \"oh well, its just the solenoid is stuck open and we could replace that.\"\n\nThey're first step to replacing a solenoid is to replace the transmission???? \n\nObviously they were looking to take advantage of me. I was out of state, young, and a woman. Also charged me 250$ in labor. Costing me close to 400$ for a transmission flush and filter. I got an estimate at my dealer back home and it was closer to $200. \n\nI'm not an idiot. I know how to check my fluid, and I know if I didn't have my dad I would have been forced to pay for a new transmission. \n\nThey gave me NO options until my dad spoke through their bullshit and got it out of the mechanic that they could have replaced the solenoid.\n\nIt just makes me realise that not even dealer with high reviews are safe. \n\nThis is the colour of my trans fluid \nhttp://imgur.com/xp2dg4o \n\n\nThe burnt and metal shavings is what they were saying my trans fluid was. \nhttp://imgur.com/43rk74z",

        "text": "I read the rules so hopefully this will be okay here as its my first actual post on an event. So let me know if it isn't please.\n\nSo this happened earlier today, lunch time. Before I explain the story I need to give you some backround on the people in this story.\n\nMy Dad: Great dude, chill af. Full on biker looking. Huge beard, tattoos and he is built like a brick shit house. Most people dont bother him or start crap cause he looks like he could crush you with on hand. But some thing not many people know is he is disabled. Broken back, can't walk for long, techinally disabled and such. Thats important in this story.\n\nMe: Social Anxious, hate most people but do my best to make Dad's life easier even though I hate hate dealing with people. Shy af until someone pisses me off.\n\nSo Dad and I decide we are gunna stop in and get Pizza for lunch. We are in town and neither of us feel like cooking later so hey, win win. So I order it online, for pickup, but I put it in Dads name and his number in case they call to confirm because I hate talking to people on the phone.\n\nWe go about our day until lunch time, he parks in a disabled spot and I hop out and head into the pizza place. At the front desk-pick up is what I can only describe as an Aussie verson of a valley girl. Blonde, seems disintrested to the customers waiting, in her late teens. I pay her no mind and look at the board, there is Dads name and it says ready to pickup. Hell yes. Get in line, get to the front, say the name, get the pizza and leave. Lol Jk. If only.\n\nI get to the counter and this Valley Girl (VG) speaks to me. She has that nasely I'm better then you and this job voice, that drags on at certian points in a word.\n\nVG: \"Can I helppppppppp you?\" draws the world out. Fuck. Just speak normally.\nMe: \"Yeah, I'm here for (Dadsname) order please.\"\n\nI shit you not, she sucks her lips in to resemble a cats puckered butthole and just slowly looks me up and down, very slowly. Making me raise my eyebrows and wait for whatever brain cells she has to work and comprehend what I am saying.\n\nVG: \"You don't look like a mannnnnn.\"\nShocker. No I dont. Well sometimes, I'm pretty ugly.\nMe: \" Its under my Dads name and number.\"\n\nYet again she looks me up and down and I'm getting impatient, like it should not take fifteen minutes to pick up a prepaid order of pizza. Shit. Then this idiot, puckers her lips again and says something that I did not expect.\n\nVG: \"I like, don't belieeeveee you.\"\nMe: Fucking gobsmacked at this point. Wut. I guess my face looked that way cause she continues.\nVG: \"I think you are trying to steal someone elses orderrrrrrrrrrr.\"\nBITCH. When I spoke my voice showed that anger, cause who just randomly goes saying someone is trying to steal?!\nMe: \"Excuse you?!\" Mum voice activated even though I don't have any kids.\n\nI guess I was loud enough or something in my tone convayed warning because an older looking man, I'm guessing a shift manager comes out and asks whats going on. VG explains in that whiney voice and I am just staring in complete shock. Like I didn't even wanna come in and pick it up but Dad couldnt walk today so I faced my social anxiety and manned up, only to be acused by some bimbo that I was trying to steal someone else prepaid order. If I was stealing it, how would I know which one was prepaid you vapid little shit. A look of horror is crossing the managers face as she explains, his eyes keep jumping between her and I, me being a picture of calm other then a look in my eyes that could cut glass or hopefully smite down the bimbo getting between me and my damn pizza. So eventually the Manager (M) speaks to me.\n\nM: \"Ma'am is this your order?\"\nMe: \"Yes it is.\" Rattles off what the order includes. \nVG: \"She is lyinggggggg! She is trying to take a man's oderrrrrr. She isn't man! Well I mean she kinda looks like one.\" Smirk on her stupid face as she stares at me. Oh this bitch. You've made a mortal enemy now you lil shit. \n\nI turn on my heel and march over to the disabled parking spot which fyi is practically right across from their front door. Their whole shop front is glass. The VG is smirking thinking she has won and watching me, while the manager is also watching me but with a ghostly paler to his skin. I don't know what he thought I was gunna do, but I stick my head in the window, tell my amazing Dad wtf just happened and ask him to come in. He can tell I am mad and knows I'm anxious, so he is mad because someone has had the balls to acusse one of his daughters of being a thef. I make a big show of walking around to his side, making sure they can see me and open his door. Dad slowly gets out, and as I said before, he is a BIG scary looking bloke. The managers face goes even whiter and that stupid smirk finally wipes off her face. So I take Dad's arm, being his support as walking more then a few steps hurts him grately. The manager realises good old Dad is having trouble walking and is in the DISABLED parking spot and his face turns down into a frown. So I walk in with my Dad and he leans against the counter. He is in pain I can tell. I look this spoiled little brat right in her face, my voice cool as winter air and my gaze ready to smite her down.\n\nMe: \"This is DADSNAME. He has trouble walking AND ASKED ME TO COME IN AND GET THE ORDER.\" I wasn't yelling but my voice was slightly aggressive. Because she has now made my poor dad come in and has been wasting my damn time. I take out my debit card and slam it down on the counter while still holding her eyes. \" This is the card the ORDER WAS PAID FOR ON. Maybe if you had checked rather then assuming an accusing me of theft, all of this could of been avoided.\"\n\nManger doesnt say anything, VG looks like she is terrified cause my Dad is large, even though he is a giant teddy bear who is just standing there trying not to smile because he thinks mad daughter is funny. After what seems like foreverrrrrr the manger kicks into gear. Apologising to me nonstop and my Dad, tells VG to go to the back and gives us our damn pizza. We got an extra dessert and garlic bread, hell yes. As we were leaving I could hear the manager in the back loud talking at VG about not only did she acuse someone of stealing but made someone who was disabled be in pain by being made to walk in cause I dare put my order in his name. \n\nSo yeah, thats how me trying to pick up pizza turned into a twenty minute shit show.",

        "text": "A local scrapbook store sent out a promotion via email for something like 20% your total order, or something along those lines. The coupon didn't have a code to enter, a barcode to scan, or even the customers name written on it. It was just a picture with some text written on it. No problem, right? I find a few things and pull out my phone to show her the email.\n\"I'm sorry. It must be printed because it can only be used once.\" \nOkay. I kind of get it. Keeping track of how many get used, I suppose. But without any sort of code to monitor if that coupon was used or not, what's stopping me from printing off 100 and using them all every day? Or I could hand them out to everyone walking through the door! I tried to explain the flaw (politely, of course. I genuinely wanted to help to avoid such coupon abuse) but the cashier didn't seem to care. Not surprising, she's just a cashier and not in charge of that kind of thing. So I emailed the owner. I was clear that I wasn't looking for an adjustment or any special coupons or anything, and that I just wanted to explain why this could be seen as a bad idea (and inconvenient for those who don't have a printer.) I don't remember the exact reply I received, but I do remember the attitude and condescension. I dropped the matter because maybe I honestly don't have business skills, and maybe her way was right and I just couldn't see it. I couldn't help but be offended at being so curtly brushed off when I was just trying to help her.\n\nThanks. That has been bothering me for a  while. I needed to get that off my brain. ",

She looks at the money, takes a penny out of the \"take a penny\" jar and puts it in the register.  This confuses me because one penny is not going to make our change come out evenly.\n\nThen she says \"You don't need the change, right?\".  Now I have to say, I'm really tired because I didn't sleep well the night before and my rheumatoid arthritis is acting up.  In other words, I'm not firing on all cylinders.\n\nI think I've misheard her somehow so I don't say anything.  She gives me $19 in bills and closes the register.  Again, I'm really tired and I don't feel like a confrontation, so I just go back to the table and leave my normal tip.  \n\nI tip well at this place because I live in an area where jobs are not plentiful and people don't make a lot of money and a lot of old people like me eat at this place and I know they don't tip a lot.  So my regular tip is $6.00.  Plus the 92 cents she kept at the register.\n\nIf she tries this again, I will absolutely say something but, really, who does that?",

        "text": "I have family visiting from out of town. My MIL, SIL with her 4 year old and 2 year old, and my other SIL and her girlfriend. So that makes 5 adult women and 3 young children (with my six month old). \n\nWe were in a new town and through yelp we found a good looking family owned resteraunt. We called ahead and asked if they were child friendly, to which they replied yes. We stated the ages of the children to verify and they again said that they were kid friendly. \n\nWe get to the resteraunt and it turns out to be this upscale place with every other customer dressed up to eat. All the other tables were reserved (with cute little scrabble tiles stating \"happy anniversary\" and \"happy birthday\" on each table)  and it was minimum $30 a plate. We decided to stay and eat because they had insisted on the phone that it was fine, even though the vibe felt otherwise.\n\nThe host had provided one high chair for us so we asked for a second and a booster seat. When he comes back we ask about kids menus because it was adult only menus on the table. He was not sure about kids menus because he is \"a host and not a waiter.\" Our waiter comes out and explains that there are no kids menus but they can make anything on the menu kid friendly (lobster Mac n cheese to just Mac n cheese, Portobello mushroom burger to a plain burger, garlic mashed potatoes to mashed potatoes). We accept this and my SIL decides to get a plain burger with French fries and Mac n cheese. \n\nThe waiter brings out our water and hands the two year old his plastic cup with a lid to which he promptly drops on the floor before my SIL can get it from him. The waiter looks exhaustedly at the spill and goes to get a towel to mop it up. My MIL awkwardly says \"it's just water it won't hurt anyone\" to unsuccessfully lighten the mood while the waiter mops it up. \n\nWhen she was done mopping she goes to the hosts stand (which I am within earshot of) and tells the host that when people make reservations and ask about children, that he should explain that while they do accommodate for children, that they don't actually have a children's menu and that it is a fine dining establishment. Turns out there was another table in the back with a small family with young children. Another waiter had also cleaned up a spill.\n\nIt turned out the host was in training. He was studying a menu and was doing some sort of training on the iPad in the hosts stand. \n\nIt was very uncomfortable with noisy children, I ended up leaving early because my baby got fussy and I didn't want to ruin the birthday and anniversary tables next to us.\n\nBut the food was really amazing, I would totally go back without my baby and eat the salmon again. There was nothing else that I would complain about the experience. The wait staff was what I would expect, the wait time for food was fair, the quality of food matched the prices,  and the ambience was great for an adult only special occasion/ romantic date. I think we were just unfortunate enough to be the \"lesson learned\" for that host. ",

        "text": "So this just happened tonight, and I'm still bemused by it. I thought maybe you guys would be as well.\n\n\nIt's late but I'm feeling kind of hungry and decide I want to go to the fast food place down the street that we'll call Knuckles. I wanted to get **six** mozzarella sticks and maybe a shake, since they're half price at this time of night. Six was right about what I was hungry for. My brother is awake, and I ask him if he wants to come with me. He says he doesn't have any money, but he also wants mozzarella sticks. Me being the nice big sister that I am, I tell him I'll see what I can do. I go there and look at the prices. I'm not rolling in the dough either, so I'm trying to come up with the cheapest option where everyone's happy. A large (8 piece) is about 50 cents cheaper than two smalls (4 piece each). They're both more expensive than the medium (6 piece) I was originally going to get, but cheaper than buying a medium for me and a small for my brother, so I decide to get the **eight** to split with my brother. (Sorry for all the numbers; I swear it's relevant.) I figure I'll also get myself a pretzel twist to make up the difference.\n\n\nI order. I wait. Lots of waiting, but then Knuckles really isn't as fast as its name would make it seem. Finally, a person comes out with my order, reads it off, I pay, and I start to pull away.\n\n\nBut then I think: they almost always forget something. I should check.\n\n\nI look in the bag and am relieved to see that it does, in fact, have marinara sauce in it. And a pretzel. And mozzarella sticks. But wait a second...\n\n\nThe mozzarella sticks seem a bit thin to me. I think, *maybe they made a medium instead of a large on accident*, so I count them. There are **seven**.\n\n\nNow, if I *had* ordered a medium, I would've thought today was my lucky day and would have peeled out of there like a bank robber with a million bucks before they realized their mistake. But I had ordered *and paid for* **EIGHT** mozzarella sticks, and I'll be darned if I was only going to get seven. I may be a nice big sister, but I wasn't going to get less than my already smaller share of four, and I didn't want to hear it from my brother about him only getting three. He would've known something weird was going on, since they don't sell them in groups of three.\n\n\nNow I'm annoyed because there's no way I come out of this looking smart. If I leave with only seven, then Knuckles has basically short changed me. But one missing mozzarella stick is such a little thing to ask for. Still, them mozz sticks are damn expensive for a side dish, so I pull back into the spot and press the button. And wait.\n\n\nFinally, someone comes on the line. I'll be me and they'll be Knucklehead or KH for short.\n\nKH: Welcome to Knuckles; what can we get you today? \n\nMe: Hi, I was just wondering how many mozzarella sticks come in the large size? *(I wanted to make sure before I made myself look even more stupid.)* \n\nKH: There are 8. \n\nMe: Okay. Well, I just ordered one and there are only seven in my bag. Could you please see if one got left in the frier? \n\n*Long pause. I wait more. Finally:* \n\nKH: No, there's nothing in the frier. We could ask the cook to make another one... \n\nMe: That would be great. \n\nKH: You want the cook to make *one* mozzarella stick? \n\nMe: Yes please. \n\nKH: It'll take 4-5 minutes for that *one mozzarella stick*. \n\nMe: Okay, thanks! *(4-5 minutes? I had my phone. I was not bothered in the least.)*\n\n\nFour to five minutes later, someone comes out with a bag, tells me to have a good evening, and I leave to go home. I don't even bother to look in the bag because it's so light, and I'm pretty sure I know what's gonna be in it.\n\nFinally at home, I look in the bag to divvy up the mozzarella sticks. There, in its own fry box, on top of its own napkins, with its own mint, all in its own bag, is **one** mozzarella stick.\n\nHey, whatever, I'm happy. I got my four sticks, my brother got his four sticks, and TalesfromtheCustomer has a new tale of hilarious pettiness.",

        "text": "I wasn't having a great day, basically avoided people all day. I felt quite down and a bit nerved up so I didn't feel like being around people. I was hungry and went to the most famous fast food joint. The first one I went to I left because someone I knew was working there lol thats how bad my social anxiety was, couldn't face a conversation with a friend because I wasn't in the mood.\n\nSo I went to the other one in my city which isn't too far. I ordered and picked up my food, it was really busy which didn't help and I eventually found a seat and whover sat there before had left a horrible mess of food and trash. Just before I sat down one of the workers started cleaning the table for me, she even apologised for getting in my way lol so I was like \"no it's fine\".\n\nI said to her \"I don't understand why some people leave their trash everywhere,\" and she said she doesn't even mind people not throwing their stuff away but when they make a mess like this. I had a nice little chat with her and she said her mum would kill her if she made a mess like this lol and I thanked her for cleaning the table for me.\n\nProbably sounds really insignificant but after the day I've had it was really nice to have a short conversation with someone. And I wanted to reassure her I was a good customer since I've done my time in retail so I know what it's like. So thanks for making my day a little better :) ",

        "text": "Today is Sunday, but I'm not religious. Just was never my thing, but I'm fine with people who are. Anyway, I had some errands to run (actually tried to go to the bank before I remembered what day it was). I'm a female in my early twenties, so I like to have fun with my outfits and makeup. Today's choices were a cop top and distressed jeans. Clearly not a professional looking outfit, but could be a lot worse. \n\nSo I go to lunch at a Wisconsin based fast food joint, very popular with old white people. And it's just past noon so all of the churches are just getting out. \n\nSitting down, enjoying my burger and talking with the person I'm with, two older ladies sit in the table next to us and I instantly feel the older ones eyes on me. I ignore it, but it becomes annoying after a constant 10 minutes of it. So I do what any normal person does and make it worse for fun.\n\nMe to my friend: \"so turns out I don't need to cover my tattoos at my new job, so that's good! And I can even get that new one I wanted\"\n\nThe two ladies start whispering now. My job is done. Their food arrives and they begin to pray over it.\n\nLadies: \"blah blah in the name of God bless this food and all that. Also, we pray that girl over there finds God\" \n\nI look at my friend and give her a look like, do they mean me? She nods and I laugh, I mean I guess they meant well? Kind of?",

It showed up over an hour late, cold and was the wrong pizza to what we had ordered (wouldnt be a big deal if my sisters son wasn't allergic to the toppings etc). When we called to conplain they wanted to have nothing to do with us and we werent treated the best.\n\nFast forward a few months Im in a new city for university and I order the same thing. It shows up an hour late but they called us to let us know the delivery man was running late and the  delivery man was super nice and apologetic and gave us a free bottle of coke to make up for the delay. It was really good customer service compared to what i was expecting from previous experience. I love when a company ensures that their customers are happy when things aren't going the best or on time etc.",

        "text": "I just found this sub and while I have a few other unpleasant stories to share, I thought I'd start with a positive one that I was reminded of today when I revisited this establishment.\n\nA while ago I was in the line at Mexican fast casual place that I was a regular at behind a really rude and confusing family of six \\(including three kids, presumably their parents, and grandma\\). I'm in line for ten minutes while they all order. Finally they all get all their food, and one of the parents goes to sit at the table with the kids, but the other parent and grandma were in front of the register arguing about who was going to pay for what. Ordering for all of them had to have taken longer than even I had been there \\(kids were super picky and only two kids of the six of them total had finished when I walked in\\), and honestly I was really pissed off because of the noise and length of time. \n\nNonetheless, I understood this wasn't the employees' fault so I tried to be perky and friendly as they made my order. However, even as I finished, they were still arguing, so I made small talk with the one employee who was hanging back from the cash register as two other employees rung up and cancelled about six different versions of what they had ordered. So I'm talking to her about school \\(we both went to the same college nearby\\) and stuff, and after 3\\-4\\+ minutes of such, she asks if I was going to want any chips/drinks \\(I didn't\\), throws my burrito in a bag, hands it to me over the glass, and tells me I'm free to go.\n\nThe grandma and parent didn't even notice me as I walked by them with my free burrito, and they were still arguing as I reached over their kids spilling drinks at the drink/silverware station to grab napkins and took off.",

And once the family of Satan has shuffled out of the shop, I quietly set my few items on the conveyor belt and quietly say to the cashier “On behalf of humanity , I apologize for those people. I assume they were human.”\n\nThe cashier starts giggling, then laughing. I laugh as well. She rings out my stuff and tells me a total that’s less than I expected. I tell her , that seems a bit low, I don’t want you to get in trouble.\n\n“Don’t worry about it, you got a discount for making my day.”\n\nAnd on the receipt it says “10% off for nice person”. I blush, smile, and wish her a lovely evening.",

        "text": "This happened a couple of weeks ago. Went out to brunch with a big group of people, and a few of us decided to continue the fun back at my house. There were five of us: me, my husband, our roommate, our friend (we’ll call her M) and her girlfriend (whom we shall refer to as J). We had used a ride share service to get there, because bottomless mimosas, so we called a car to take us back. Our driver shows up in his mini van, and we all pile in, with M hopping into the passenger seat. \n\nThe ride started and we attempted the usual, polite small talk. Our roommate asked him how long he’d been driving for the company (rhymes with swift), and that’s where things went downhill.\n\nInstead of answering the question, the guy tells us he was a special education teacher, but he’d recently been fired for his religious beliefs. There was some nervous silence before my roomie tentatively asked which religion, to which he replied, “I’m a very proud Born Again Christian.”  At this point the tension in the car could be cut with a knife, because we know that religion’s stance on gay people and we have two lesbians in the car, one sitting right next to him. \n\nM, unflinchingly honest, breaks the silence by saying, “I don’t buy it, man. I think there are rules in place against firing people for their religion.”  The man argues back that, no, he was really fired because of religion and “this damned PC culture,” and goes on to say, “people like you are what’s screwing up this country.”\n\nNow, I work as a public school administrator and know the laws, and J is a teacher for a Catholic private school. Up until this point we’d stayed quiet, hoping to avoid a scene and just get through the 15 minute drive home, but after his last comment we couldn’t stay silent. I told him, “Sir, with all due respect, I work in admin for a public school and I know that discrimination policies are still in effect for school employees. It would be illegal for you to be fired just for your religious affiliation.” Then, J hits him with her reverse situation; she works for a private Catholic school and when they found out she was gay there was a little backlash, but they couldn’t legally fire her for it. On top of that, the parents loved her because she was great at her job, so it wasn’t even an issue for them.\n\nAs soon as J mentioned she was a lesbian, this asshole turned up his radio and literally attempted to drown us out with Christian music! We all looked at each other, stunned that this was actually happening. At this point we have about five minutes to go, and later we all admitted that we half expected him to pull over and kick us out. In his anger, he missed two turns, and we had to yell over the music to alert him of this. \n\nHe turned down the music, but then resumed his rant about how people like us were the scum of the earth, that we’d know real retribution in the end (referring to the second coming), that the world needed a return to decency. He continued this up until we reached the house. Any time any of us tried to speak up, he yelled, “STOP TALKING OVER ME!” even though none of us had raised our voices, or even gotten more than one word in. \n\nMy husband, who’d remained largely silent up to this point, was last to exit the van. As he was closing the door, he said to the guy, “Thank you for getting us to our destination safely. I know we have differing views, but we really appreciate the ride.” The guy responded by screaming, “YOU’RE AN ASSHOLE!” out the window as he sped off.\n\nWe were all shaken when we got inside and immediately wrote a scathing review.  Haven’t heard back from the company yet, but I hope he’s never allowed to drive for them again. ",
