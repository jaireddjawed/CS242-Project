Passive TV, daily life etc. Watched Alice in Borderland recently and realised was passively picking up old and words.\n\nQuestion\n\n1. Used Microsoft Translator in Android split screen to live translate Japanese YouTube videos. Hit and miss. Now not working so well. Google Translate always stops the video when you click the mic. I feel O changed something in the OS settings or was never meant to work.\n\nAs a workaround installed Google Live Transcribe. That works well as Speech to text. But then need another step to translate the Japanese which defeats the objective. \n\n2. Any recommendations of Japanese news, current affairs channels with English subtitles? \n\nThanks",

Try it out for free.)\n\nWe just added a new game mode to Roxxem called Lyric Puzzle which I'm really excited about, and would love to get feedback from y'all on.\n\nLyric Puzzle is a puzzle game where you match words and lyrics together. Listen to the lyric you need to complete, then build the lyric, word-by-word, before your moves run out.\n\nThink Candy Crush Saga meets Concentration.\n\nMy teammate also made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2J7SQSNMj0) showing him playing and wrote a [blog post](https://www.roxxem.com/blog/introducing-lyric-puzzle) about it.\n\nIt's a whole new way to learn song lyrics, and unique in this space, as far as I know. I've been using it to learn \"Despacito\" myself and I think it's pretty fun and effective :)\n\nTry it out and let me know what you think! This is only the first version of the game, so with your help it will continue to get better.",

        "text": "Language learning takes a long time. Like, a _really_ long time. In a lot of ways it's much closer to learning how to play an instrument than learning an actual body of knowledge.\n\nLife gets busy at times. Like, _really_ busy at times. Maybe you just started a full time job; maybe you just had a child with your beautiful foreign spouse. Maybe you just started a full time job _and_ had a kid _and_ a new gym routine _and_ have just broken into a new social scene, and, and, and. And you might not have the time you once did to keep pushing the edges of what you know, at the rate you once were able to.\n\nLet me propose a new strategy to you. It's called **4 new words is enough.** Not 10, although that's great. Not 5. Four. Neljä. Neljä sanoja.\n\nAnyone can keep 4 new chunks of information in their head at a time, even if you're pressed elsewhere for time and for energy and for stress. The trick is, before you decide 4 new words is too slow: You want to _really_ learn those 4 new words.\n\nDr. Paul Nation, language pedagogy expert the Foreign Service Institute, has a YouTube video I'm too lazy to dig up where he explains that learning the dictionary meaning of the words is just the tip of the iceberg. At a minimum, to have a new word really \"take\", you need to see it in **varied contexts** - that is to say, different sentences, different paragraphs, different grammatical forks - and you need to see it in a bunch of them. 7 or 8 can work if they're really good contexts; I aim for 10-12, since my initial sentence source is usually isolated phrases on Tatoeba. Of course I also try to practice reading and consuming native content, but understanding those 10-12 sentences is what I consider the bare minimum for _really_ learning a new word.\n\n4 new words starts to sound a lot more fun when looked at as \"40 new sentences\". It will get you farther than you think.",

I've loved learning languages my entire life, but I get distracted easily with which language to learn (e.g., if I meet someone Italian, I think - I should REALLY learn Italian).\n\n**The quandary:** I've never been able to focus on a language until recently, when I decided to try learning Italian. I've been learning for about 10 months and I'm now roughly at a B1 level. I have a few close friends that are Italian and often sit with them while they are speaking Italian or message back and forth with them in Italian. I've wanted to speak Italian since I was young and find the pronunciation mostly intuitive.  **However**: I took French when I was in high school for 4 years and feel that my understanding of the structures is more robust. I also think French will be more useful for me in my work (my job has potential for me to work with many francophone countries), where Italian seems like more of a hobby language. I have two or three friends with whom I could practice my French (though I have not, because I have not really tried to use it since high school, barring one trip to Paris). I will also be moving in the next 6 to 8 months and leaving behind most of my close circle of Italian friends - we will still be in contact via phone, but I may not have the same consistent immersion that I have now (though I do have at least 2 Italian colleagues that I practice my Italian with fairly regularly). \n\nI have gone back and forth over the last two months trying to decide. I'm planning on committing to a quite expensive language course for the selected language, and I want to make sure I choose the best language for me because the financial investment is so high. This course required an intake interview, where we practiced my comprehension and speaking in both languages - my French interviewer agreed that right now my speaking and comprehension were not great, but that I had familiarity with the language and the structures were there somewhere (hidden beneath the Italian, no doubt!!); and my Italian interviewer was very enthusiastic and surprised by how much I could already speak. \n\nI had actually thought I might be able to keep learning them at the same time - translate back and forth between French and Italian, but given how my intake interview went, I think this is just my difficulty in committing to one language coming into play again. \n\nWhat do y'all think? My heart says Italian, but my head says French. :(",

        "text": "So lately, to challenge myself, I've been translating posts from Quora and other websites -- usually interesting stories, historical tidbits and the like. Recently I wrote about a cough syrup nicknamed the \"baby killer\" (because it had enough opium in it to sedate a horse). Thinking I did fairly well with maybe a mistake here and there, I published it. I saw a LOT of highlighted points and thought \"Oh shit I've really screwed up\". But my corrector kindly informed me: \n\n\"These errors aren't because your level of Spanish has suffered but because you're doing a translation exercise and you have to make an effort so that the English underneath isn't noticeable. Many phrases might sound fine in terms of grammar, but that's not how they're naturally said in Spanish. Now, you're not doing a Spanish exercise but a translation exercise, which is different. You have to try to move from one language to another while sharing the same concepts in the original language but ungluing yourself from the structure and try to find more natural ways of transmitting this same concept in the destination language. Furthermore, you're not translating TO your native tongue (direct translation, like what I'm writing in this post), but rather from a foreign language, which is much harder.\" \n\nSo my language learning friends, apart from continuing to do translation exercises and getting corrected, is there anything else I can do to help myself with this process? [Here's the thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/WriteStreakES/comments/1036eng/streak_961_el_jarabe_calmante_de_la_sra_winslow/) if you'd like to read the original.  I'm not beating myself up for not knowing things like \"laudanum\" in Spanish (I didn't even know what it was in English) but rather making concepts sound more natural and native-like.",

I live in California and there’s not a lot of opportunities to speak my other languages (that I’m aware of).\n\nI know Turkish from my mom, and I can understand it very well but I don’t speak it often. I used to live in Italy and spoke Italian for preschool. It was a long time ago but I refreshed basic Italian last year and it was easier to pick up than Spanish for me.

I don’t know anyone who has a multilingual background like I do and is determined to learn even more. I’m somewhat torn between what language(s) to focus on too. My course schedule is packed with my major classes, and it leaves no room for language classes, so I’m mostly looking for self study methods in a way.\n\nSo if anyone has any resources, groups, schedule regimens, advice, or experience to share from their own language learning, it would be much appreciated. If anyone is in the same position as me, feel free to reach out to me too :)\n\nAny recommendations specific to what language(s) I should focus on would also be awesome.\n\nNote: \nI don’t know which language to focus on because I want to use all of them and more. \n\n- Spanish: come across several occasions it would be useful\n- Italian: easier to pick up given my experience\n- Turkish: for family\n\nAnd other languages I desperately want to learn in my lifetime…\n\n- German: may want to live in Germany\n- Dutch: easy for English speakers to learn\n- Norwegian/Swedish: dreaming of escape to a country with universal health care and free education",

I'm not new to it but I still have  lots to learn. I'm looking for native speakers, others who speak it,  and/or anyone who is learning also, no matter what level you're at. We  have a WhatsApp group where we chat and help each other to learn. It  will be for all levels and native speakers who will be so kind to assist  those who are learning, at whatever level. Native Polish speakers may  benefit by improving their English here too!\n\nIf  you are serious about learning Polish, even if you have no knowledge of  it, then you are welcome to join. If you can teach/help those who are  learning then you are most welcome also. This is for WhatsApp only! If  you do not like or really use WhatsApp then this isn't for you. You can  chat about whatever you like, just try your best to make it in Polish,  even if using a translator. This group is not perfect and we don't  expect you to be. Making mistakes is absolutely fine! The group is new  and still finding its feet. The group cannot spoon feed you, it is up to  you to make use of the native Polish speakers available to you.  Communication is the key! YOU make the group what it is. Share your  learning materials and any learning ideas you may have.\n\nWe  will communicate by text, voice notes, and video calls if you like. But  mostly text and voice messages as this appears to be the preferred way.  It is entirely up to you. My preferred way is by voice or video, but  text is also very important.\n\nSerious  learners/teachers only please! And by serious I don't mean you need to  be a scholar, just a person who is genuinely learning the language (even  by yourself at home), and not joining the group for unrelated purposes.\n\nMocking  other members in any way will not be tolerated. You'll be removed from  the group. There's no such thing as stupid questions, so ask anything at  all with full confidence! Spammers and trolls will be banned! I  strongly encourage everyone in the group to be fully open and expressive  when asking questions or answering them, and to support those who are  so, as some people can lack confidence.

I'm   not new to Hebrew but I still have lots to learn. I'm looking for native    Israelis, other Jewish people who know Hebrew, and/or others who are    learning also, no matter what level you're at. We have a  WhatsApp  group   where we chat and help each other to learn. It will be for all   levels   and native speakers who will be so kind to assist those who are   learning, at whatever level. Native Hebrew speakers may benefit by    improving their English too!\n\nIf     you are serious about learning Hebrew, even if you have no knowledge of   it, then you are welcome to join. If you can teach/help those who are     learning then you are most welcome also. This is for WhatsApp only!  You   can chat about whatever you like, just try your best to make it in    Hebrew, even if using a translator. This group is not perfect and we    don't expect you to be. Making mistakes is absolutely fine! The group  is   new and still finding its feet. The group cannot spoon feed you, it  is   up to you to make use of the native Hebrew speakers available to  you.   Communication is the key! YOU make the group what it is. Share  your   learning materials and any learning ideas you may have.\n\nWe     will communicate by text, voice notes, and video calls if you like.    But  mostly text and voice messages. It is entirely up to you. My    preferred  way is by voice or video, but text is also very important.\n\nSerious    learners/teachers only please! And by serious I don't mean you need  to   be a scholar, just a person who is genuinely learning the language,   and  not joining the group for unrelated purposes.\n\nSpammers and trolls will be banned!\n\nIf you're interested here's the link: [https://chat.whatsapp.com/FVb741kMbS42T3H6BUBcMB](https://chat.whatsapp.com/FVb741kMbS42T3H6BUBcMB)\n\nI look forward to seeing you there 🙂\n\nתודה",

Tried that, 0 captions for the 3 languages  listed above.\n\nNetflix? What am I going to watch after I have watched the limited number of shows? Also Netflix should be a source of entertainment, not for beginners\n\nMovie sites, transcripts, captions etc... same argument as above \n\nLearner YouTube channels (Easy Languages): Sure, but I prefer to watch stuff for natives. Also the above arguments apply here as well (i.e what to do after watching the limited amount of content)?)\n\nWhat is the problem with not having captions?  \n\nI can't get a constant stream of listening content that is COMPREHENSIBLE. By that, I mean news and clickbait channels that update daily, which I can do with the languages with auto captions. (And after using them for the initial phase I don't even need them anymore). I can watch stuff that I'm interested in that does not have manually produced captions with auto captions, that makes the audio comprehensible. \n\nAudiobooks are a good substitute, I agree, but I really wish there were more alternatives to effective mass immersion for less popular languages because not everyone likes audiobooks (I don't). Besides, it's not like the audiobooks available for these languages are aplenty anyway. \n\nI guess for now, the only languages that are possible to reach a high level in (unless one lives in that country or has relatives or friends who are native speakers) are (according to the languages that have auto captions available): Dutch, English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n\nI wish my brain was rewired so that I like Dutch or German more than Polish or Kazakh. But oh well, looks like I don't have a choice. Gotta choose according to what Google does. \n\nI guess this is what is really meant by \"between a rock and a hard place.\"",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/104108t/italki_experience_of_trying_7_tutors_and_how_i/",
        "text": "**Tl,dr 1: I tried 7 different tutors on iTalki, built confidence to speak, and am now considering moving on to professional teachers for more educated feedback on my mistakes.** \n\n**Previous learning experiences and my level:** I used LingQ to read German easy news and other stories as a complete beginner. After two months or so, I started doing grammar exercises and had just finished A2-level grammar by the time I started with iTalki. I listened to easy German news audio and practiced reading out loud at times, but other than that, I didn’t know much about listening and speaking practices.\n\nBefore I started iTalki lessons, I felt like I couldn’t output comfortably at all. When I read, I could understand a lot, but when I tried to output, either by writing or speaking, there was like a brain fog blocking any vocabulary or phrases from being recalled. My reading level was estimated to be A2, and my speaking level was at ground zero.\n\nThat has changed a lot since I started. I’ve tried 7 different teachers in 2 weeks to find out what I want from these classes and to see different styles of teachers.\n\nIn the following post, I’ll break down the experiences with each teacher in detail, after which I’ll summarize my improvement, the overall experience, and how I’ll proceed from here. Hopefully, this can give fellow language learners who haven’t tried iTalki a bit more insight.\n\n**Experience with different tutors:**\n\n**No.1.** Community Tutor. Trial class. $10/h.  6k lessons, lesson-students ratio = 6, non-native speaker.\n\nIt’s my first time speaking to a real person in German. I wouldn’t say I was nervous, but I was trying hard to understand what was being asked and to construct an answer. The conversation was basic, but I managed my first self-introduction. Yea! The tutor was more insistent on speaking in German. This is fine. Talks slowly. But he was quite serious and didn’t smile much. Because of that, I’m not inclined to book him again.\n\n**No.2** Community Tutor.  Trial class. $10/h. 5k lessons, Radio = 8, non-native speaker.   \n\nShe’s quite popular. Lesson openings are almost fully booked. She laughs a lot, and I just like this friendly, fun atmosphere she built. She talks slowly with simple words that I can understand. I managed to construct good basic conversation with her. I’m looking forward to booking her again.\n\n**No.3** Professional Teacher. $32/h, 8k lessons. Ratio=6, Native speaker, business law background.\n\nMy last trial lesson. I wanted to see if professional teachers are different. And yes, he tried to teach me some grammar points such as the difference between seit and vor. Before the class ended, he suggested that we follow a book and be more structured. I said okay sounds great but I don't plan to book him again because his rate is too high for me at the time. He uses Google Docs.\n\n**No.4** Professional Teacher. $17/h, 1.7k lessons, ratio=5, Background: Educational scientists.  \n\nAfter self-introductions and a small chat about what cities I want to visit in Germany, he suggests we follow a text. We went through a short text together. I found that I’m not so fond of this method as I can read texts outside of class myself. But the teacher’s okay, he answered my questions and offered some grammar/pronunciation tips. I may consider going back to him and suggest something else to do.\n\n**No.5** Community Tutor: $10/h, 4k lesson, ratio=7, History Master\n\nThis one is a bit tricky. I’m interested in him because he has a Magister in history, and he offers courses to talk about history in German. But almost as soon as the lesson started, he said politely that my level might be too low to talk about history in German and that maybe we can work through some texts together to make sure I'm understanding them correctly. Fair enough. But he also tended to explain concepts of history in a long German monologue or a long English monologue. It shows that his grip on class flow and the awareness to speak in simpler German and encourage engagement are different from Community Tutors No.1 and No.2. I still have faith in him because of my interest in history, but I probably will book him again only when I’m more advanced in several months. B1 at least.\n\n**No.6** Community Tutor.  $10/h, 700 lessons, ratio = 3, food industry background.  \n\nAfter greetings and self-introductions, I talked a bit about my experience during the COVID, though he doesn’t seem to be much interested in it. Then we started talking about food. And it was fun! I’m always a food lover and like cooking. He showed me a recipe with which I wanted to try cooking. I look forward to trying to cook knödel, learning more vocabulary of cooking verbs and cooking ingredients, and discussing the whole experience with him. It’s fun and there's no stress.\n\n**No.7** Community Tutor. $10/h, 5k lesson, ratio=3, non-native speaker, business master.\n\nThis was the only one who wasn't using a computer or laptop in class but was on her cell phone. Her connection also had a bit of a problem, and her video disappeared several times with only audio continuing. I found it very unprofessional. But anyway, I didn’t say anything and started sharing my stories. I was having a blast and talked a lot about my experience working in a big city. I enjoyed expressing myself in my broken German, though I can’t understand her reply quite well. I could have asked her to slow down and use simpler words, but I didn’t because I was too into sharing. I asked her sometimes how to say something, and at the end of the class, she encouraged me to gain more vocabulary and pointed out some grammar mistakes that I consistently made.\n\n**My Improvements:**  \n\n1. My confidence grew. Before these lessons, I thought I      couldn’t write or speak German. But now I've demonstrated that my recent      learning can indeed help me hold a conversation in German.\n2. My enthusiasm for general German learning, specifically      listening and speaking, was boosted. I’m going through a structured      listening and speaking practice book to ensure a solid base, which previously      I was reluctant to do.\n3. My desire to share has increased. I used to like      Hellotalk a lot. The Hellotalk Korean and Japanese communities are great,      and I owe a lot of my KR/JP improvement to them. But the German community      there is smaller, and my desire to share and post moments in German was      low. But since I started iTalki lessons, my desire to express myself in      German has increased tremendously, and I have been consistently posting      moments in German for a week. This is excellent writing practice and      cultural exchange. I’m thinking about starting to use Tandem for having      conversations with German people, too.\n4. Speaking German has become more spontaneous. I found      myself thinking in German more and would try to describe what I was doing      or thinking in German all the time.\n\nAll of these are basic things that I have struggled with, but with these human interactions, they have all become easier. Though I feel like I’m strengthening my output ability with the knowledge I already have and that I didn’t learn much \"new\" from the teachers, an issue I intended to address. I’ll talk about it more later.\n\n**My views on different teachers:**\n\n1. Professional teachers are more proactive in pointing      out mistakes than community tutors, who usually only answer after I ask.\n2. For free conversation classes, chemistry matters, and I      prefer a more cheerful personality in my teacher.\n3. I enjoyed talking about different things with different      tutors from different professional backgrounds. Some I can discuss deeper      topics with, and some I can share everyday life matters with.\n4. Non-native      speakers tend to be more conscious of speaking lowly to match the level of      students. \n\nThe lesson with tutor No. 7 was yesterday. After that, I'll have my first group class on the weekend, and then no more appointments. I started to browse more teachers' profiles to find more teachers to try. By chance, I filtered by Chinese Mandarin, my mother tongue. There’s a Chinese girl who majored in German and earned a master’s degree in translation from Austria. While I’m not looking for a Chinese speaker specifically, a teacher from the same language background who has mastered the target language through active learning might have faced the same challenges that I’m facing right now, and that experience could provide values that native speakers can’t provide. Thus, I’m interested in booking her for a more grammar-focused class, in which I want her to be correcting my mistakes more proactively.  \n\nThen I found someone so good it’s unbelievable. A professional teacher from Switzerland, who has a master’s degree in sinology and linguistics, taught classical Chinese, and can speak fluent Manchu. Now, for those who don’t know, Manchu is a language spoken by the ethnic Manchu people, who were the ruling class in China’s Qing Dynasties. Following the fall of the Qing, many Manchus feared prosecution by Han and abandoned their language. Today, native Manchu speakers’ numbers are only in the hundreds. I can’t believe I found such a gem on iTalki. Then, his profile impressed me. Quote “I am trained, linguistics-savvy, and well-read. If you need an explanation for a complicated grammar phenomenon in German, you won't hear answers like \"It just works that way; I don't know why\" from me.” -- Now that’s the spirit!\n\nInspired by him, I started checking the profiles of other professional teachers, who are usually out of my budget. I started to have a better idea of what I wanted from iTalki lessons by going through their profiles and seeing them describe their method. Thanks to my self-learning ability, I can learn grammar, and vocabulary outside of class. But consistently applying that knowledge correctly is the challenge. As I have no fear of butchering the conversation with words in random grammar, timely feedback from an experienced teacher is of vital importance.\n\n**With the aforementioned factors in mind, I anticipated below-average services from a professional teacher.**\n\n1. An evaluation of my abilities.\n2. Immediate correction.\n3. Provides a document with my mistakes for me to review.\n4. Deep understanding of grammar and phonetics to provide      accurate feedback and fitting training.\n\nI do think most teachers will be able to provide these if I ask, but I shortlisted a few teachers who specifically mentioned these points in their profiles and are in the $30–40 range. I’ll start trying with them to see if it works.\n\n**There are two types of lessons I plan to have:** \n\n1. Professional lessons: Focus on accurate expression and      grammar, on building solid ground. I’ll do lots of reading and practice      off-class to get myself familiar with the vocabulary needed for the topic      and be well-prepared before I attend.\n2. Free talk lessons: With community tutors whom I click      with, I just have fun, and would be worry-free.\n\nI’ll add group classes to the list if the trial goes well.\n\nOkay, the end! Any thoughts?",

        "text": "Hi everyone :) I'm thinking of changing my language tutor soon, and I thought this would be a fun/insightful topic to discuss with other learners. If you have changed tutors before, what were the reasons? Do you not like their method at all, or do you not like some part of it? Or maybe on the flip side - you dont like their method but you chose to stick with their classes. why's that?\n\nFor me, reason #1 is my goal changed. It changed from wanting to just understand my TL, to wanting to be able to speak it. So while I used to be happy being a silent student while my tutor explain things, now I want to try applying what I learned and converse. \n\nWhich brings me to reason #2 - my tutor doesn't want to talk about things I care about. I mentioned to them that my biggest reason to learn my TL is music and I'm a huge fan of these two musicians. But everytime I brought up music or those musicians, they just kinda brushed me off. Which is understandable in a daily situation - I'm not a huge fan of my local music too and normally I wouldn't want to discuss them - but this is someone I paid to have conversations with. I should be able to talk about things I'm interested in, no? At the very least they can always ask me \"stupid\" questions to pretend to be engaging. Ask me what are my favs names, where they're from, how old they are. Or just music question - what's your fav song, why do you like them, who sings it, how long is the song, etc.\n\nReason #3 - I'm bored with their lessons and it's starting to feel like it's not worth my money. When we first started they promised me fun lessons like learning through songs, movie snippets, etc. I've had about 12 lessons now. We only listened to a song once. The rest are via textbooks. In my last session, we spent about 15-20 mins translating a list of word. I legit could do that with google/dictionary for free.\n\nSo yeah, those are my reasons. I'm just going to finish the remaining lessons I paid for, and then I'm switching tutors. What about you guys?",

This would be opposed to uncommon words which most people would never know until they get into contact with that specific group, field or thing where it's relavent, or overly specific and complex concepts to which most people will never know the name. I then wonder whether there would be a list of words most native speakers know, but you won't encounter all that frequently.",

        "text": "I'm really bad at learning languages and most of the time it's because I get easily confused and don't \"get\" things. I get easily bogged down in the technicalities of how the language I'm learning will translate from English, and I end up getting frustrated when I can't find a clear answer.\n\nI recently listened to a podcast that said that sometimes in language learning we have to just accept the way things are said without putting up a fight, because \"that's just the way it is\". I know that all my questions do have answers to them, but it's not really worth knowing because they don't really matter in the long term.\n\nFor examples:\n\nI'm trying to learn Spanish and I was learning about \"ser\" vs \"estar\" and when to use each verb. Generally people say that \"ser\" is used for permanent things and \"estar\" is used for temporary things. Therefore, for certain adjectives such as \"aggressive\", you could describe someone as being a generally aggressive person with \"ser\", or someone who was aggressive in the moment with \"estar\". However, I learned for the adjective \"cansado\" which means sleepy or tired that you always have to use \"estar\", because one cannot be in a permanent state of tiredness. This is where I started overthinking this one adjective. I asked my boyfriend, who is a native speaker, if you could use \"ser\" if you wanted to describe a person who could perhaps be in a perpetual state of tiredness. He said no. I told him that I feel like there are sometimes genuinely people who are just constantly tired regardless of how much they slept, so if that's how I wanted to describe them, would it still be correct using \"ser\"? He said no again and that he didn't really know why, but grammatically it would just never be a correct sentence in Spanish. \n\nThis example isn't too bad (and I did end up finding an explanation), but I start getting more frustrated when learning verb tenses. That's when it starts to go really downhill. I think I'm too caught up in learning how English translates into Spanish instead of just learning Spanish. \n\nI've gotten mixed opinions on whether it's okay to be hyper focused on details or not. Do you guys think it's better to get an explanation on what you don't understand, or to let things go and accept that that you can't know exactly how everything works?",

Any advice on how to maintain Italian as I focus as a beginner on French? \n\nI really like keeping both a LingQ and Duolingo streak going to keep me in contact with Italian daily, even though nowadays most of my “learning” is by reading on my Kindle, watching Youtube videos, listening to podcasts, conversation practice with my tutor and iTalki, and watching movies/shows. I have found that I really like reading fiction via the Kindle anyway, not on LingQ (which I like for short non fiction articles).\n\nI guess I just need someone to tell me to not worry about keeping a streak with Italian anymore, I’m well past that. It's a honestly usually a chore to keep the daily LingQ and Duolingo streak going and I know my learning comes from elsewhere now, but there's a part of me that's worried I won't keep up with Italian anymore if I let them die. As someone who is clearly a streak junky, I guess I should make French my daily focus as a beginner and just let Italian be the natural part of my life that it already is.",
