        "text": "I'm [f24] a full time student and get approximately 1000 dollars per month, in student loans, and some more from a part time job. My boyfriend [M28], of 5 years, works full time and earns 5 times as much. I pay 1/3 of the rent. The rest we split 50/50, like food, our dog and other activities like going out with friends, visiting places. Recently i've been feeling weird about it since we plan to spend our lifes together, start a family, and i feel icky about this \"mine and yours\" thing. Since i'm studying from home i take care of all the household stuff like cleaning, cooking, washing, taking care of our dog so I still feel like i bring stuff to the table. \n\nThis leads to two questions: \nWould you think its fair with this setup? How do other couples do? I would want to have a common economy but i'm the one who doesn't have much atm so I don't want to expect anything from him. I also like to spend a few 100 dollars each month on new clothes, makeup and if we have common economy i would feel like i'm taking his money. \n\nAnd also: \nMy boyfriend wants to travel this summer and keep begging me but I don't want to blow up all my savings just to travel. i feel pressured because I don't want him to be bored and wish he had someone with more money. I've suggested we do something in our country but he insists we travel to the other side of the world, which i would love but I can't afford. What should i do?\n\nI will eventually graduate and hopefully get a job, it will never pay as much as his work though (according to statistics) so I will always be in a disadvantage. I know if i got payed as much as he did i would pay for everything at home and make sure my partner doesn't blow up all their student loans, since in the end we will both pay for the depth with a common economy. But thats just my view and expectations...\n\nTl:dr; boyfriend [m28] of 5 years earns 5 times as much as me [f24], living of student loans. We split almost everything 50/50. Is it fair to wish for a common household economy? Boyfriend wants to travel, I don't want to spend my savings on it. What should I do?",

Wondering if this will cause issues later and what are things I can do to prevent this? \n\nFirstly, I’d like to say my boyfriend and I are both in very fortunate positions. We both make good incomes however I am earning more than my boyfriend given my career choices despite him being 9 years older than me. He also works in a more unstable industry whereas my salary will continue to grow at a steady rate. There is the possibility that as he gets older, promotion opportunities become more rare so the difference in income could get larger.\n\nWe’ve been dating for close to a year and things are getting more serious, we are thinking of moving in together. I’ve never been in a relationship where I earn more than my partner, so just trying assess whether this will become an issue e.g. if/when we have kids and if I choose to reduce to part time work. Outside of finances, I’m also scared of how this will be perceived by family and friends. \n\nDoes this seem like an issue to you? Have you been in a similar scenario and how did you navigate it?",

I will say that I do always sacrifice and tell him “yes” even when it hurts me because I’d rather suffer than deal with him being upset etc. It’s something that I’m working on.\n\n\nBut how do I tell him that the selfishness is getting out of hand? I really do love him so much, and I know if I say something it will crush him because I know he isn't purposely being malicious and trying to hurt me.\n\n\nI’m sure people will say to obviously bring it up in our therapy session.

        "text": "My mom has been a smoker since before I was born. She quit in 2011 but could never get off nicotine replacements. I myself picked up the habit in 2019 but quit in April 2021. I was so ashamed that I started that my mom and sister didn’t know until mid 2020 despite living with me at the time. I haven’t quite quit vaping yet so I completely understand how tough of an addiction it is to break. My mom relapsed hard not long after she found out I was smoking. First it was an occasional cigarette, then vaping in secret, then vaping only when I was around, then vaping constantly all day long. I’ve talked to her many times about how much I wish she’d quit again and have generally been pretty polite about it. My sister is much less understanding. \n\nShe’s been having really bad dental problems for a year now and had to have a tooth pulled last week. She’s been talking about that as her quit date for a month now and I’ve patiently waited for it. I caught her vaping again today. \n\nI’m resentful because I feel like this has been a very calculated slip back into addiction due to my own smoking and I can’t help but blame myself for it. After she found out I was smoking, she would confide in me that she still had the occasional cigarette and even bought a pack every once in a while. Then it became that she had a cigarette whenever she saw a specific friend (which was almost every night). Then she started leaving her cigarettes out in the open while my sister was out so I’d have to remind her to put them away before she got back. Then she’d ask me to bum a cigarette or pick her up a pack of vapes at the gas station (this particularly bothered me because I explained on multiple occasions why I was uncomfortable supplying her with smoking stuff and she always “forgot” by the next time she asked). I feel very manipulated into covering for her and gradually accepting it and I’m furious. I feel like she saw my vulnerability due to my own addiction and the fact that I would feel too hypocritical to say anything against it and used that to feed her own addiction. \n\nFinally my sister busted her about a year ago. I thought it would get better but it got so much worse. She stopped trying to hide it and smoked constantly. She literally vaped multiple times per minute all day. She did it in the car and would get offended when I rolled my window down or complained about the smell. If we ate at a restaurant or went to the store she’d take a hit literally as she stepped out the door. She did it while laying down. She was so inconsiderate about where she’d blow her smoke and would blow it directly at me (massive pet peeve of mine and one of the main reasons I have never smoked around anyone). \n\nI’m still living at home for several reasons. I lost my job due to the pandemic. It took me awhile to get back on my feet. But then my sister went away to college. I stayed at home so I could pay half the rent and my mom could give the rest of the money to my sister. I didn't want her to struggle with student loans like I do. Now I just feel like I'm subsidizing my moms addiction because I know she's spending $100+ per week on vapes and she hardly ever has money to give my sister\n\nI've been asking her to quit my entire life and I am so tired. Even though I've mostly quit smoking I have literal nightmares about me one day being comfortable enough with my addiction to smoke around my family. I feel like a hypocrite for being this upset when I did it too. I don't know what I'm looking for in posting here I guess I just wanted to vent\n\nTl;dr: I’m mad at my mom for relapsing after she quit smoking. Looking for advice on how to even talk about this",

I’ve received a generous amount of money for clothes, foods, and have an ipad on the way. All which I expressed to not mind not getting but he does to make me happy. \n\nOne thing that bothers me is he says things like “you owe me kisses for this.” And that doesn’t sit right with me as I don’t see that having to be said in a relationship. While I do admit that I am not super physically affectionate: one it makes me uncomfortable that that’s said and two if he says I owe him is he really doing this out of his happiness..\n\nIt’s something I remind him quite often. That I feel uncomfortable when he does that so it’s been hard for me to accept some gifts. He says he understands and says okay, but it happens again next time with a different potential gift he has in mind. This applies to any other discomfort I share with him in our relationship. Same things happen again.\n\nI feel there is a possibility of these being held against me if there would be a time of you know, disagreement. Or am I overanalyzing his actions and this situation. Any insight would be appreciated thank you.\n\nTLDR: Boyfriend gifts me a lot and says I owe him physical affection. It makes me uncomfortable but sharing my thoughts hasn’t changed anything yet.

In the two month mark I met his friends at a home dinner. Lisa was friendly but at the same time it looked as if she was trying to make me uncomfortable. For example, she was joking around about the fact that she has seen Ben's penis when they all went to a nudist beach, she kept complimenting Ben about his cooking and personality, and saying how she wishes she could meet someone like him. And the cherry on top is that when Ben voiced an opinion she found \"adorable\", she said \"I want to hug you!\", turned towards me saying \"don't get jealous\" and proceeded with sitting on Ben's lap! Then she kept saying how he is like a brother to her. Quite an obvious mind game going on.\n\nWhen it was the two of us, I told Ben how uncomfortable it made me feel and how I felt Lisa was being territorial. I was disappointed in how he let her sit on his lap, and he agreed that it was weird and she caught him off-guard. A few days after that, Ben confronted Lisa about it and set boundaries. Lisa kept saying that they are like brothers, but one of their other friends, \"Mary\" was also there and she told Lisa off, and said I was right to be upset and anyone would be upset in my shoes.\n\nBen wants to invite me to their group outings, and while I like all his other friends I feel uncomfortable with the idea of Lisa being there. I end up finding an excuse for not going, and I can see he misses me and really wants me there. I also hate missing out on fun, but don't know how to navigate this. Please help!\n\nTLDR; My partner has a female friend who has been a good friend to him but crosses boundaries and is territorial (e.g. sat on his lap out of the blue when I first met her). Partner set boundaries with her, and wants me to join his friend group outings. I feel uncomfortable going because of this female friend, even though I want to go and I like his other friends a lot. How do I navigate this?",

        "text": "\n\n\nTL;DR: bf of 1.5 years with mental and substance abuse issues is asking for a two week Hail Mary to turn his life around, says I have to decide by then if I want to keep working at it or possibly never see him again \n\n\nI have made many posts on my partner in the last year. We started long distance and at first, he was very attentive and sweet and had all these plans for dates and things. He’s in a band that signed and occasionally gets money from the label, but otherwise is very laid back about a job and money and one of my first questions to him was if he could take care of himself and afford to take me on dates sometimes or travel with me. He said yes. \n\nHe ended up moving to another state with me after a few months (still living apart). He ended up really hating the move and fell into a deep depression and was drinking 6-12 beers a night and barely working, just doing door dash. He would go back and forth between saying he just wanted a normal job Vs saying he couldn’t possibly because it would interfere with his art. After a few weeks of this, he told me he was unmedicated bipolar and he wanted therapy. I found insurance for $6 a month for him and told him to do it, then he got mad and said he didn’t want to and I was trying to change him. \n\nOne day he was panicking about paying for his apartment and I reluctantly told him he could crash with me for a few months and just work and save up and get a little bit ahead because he wouldn’t have to pay rent. He ended up door dashing like 15-20 hours a week and not saving anything and this is when I really saw how bad his drinking was. I told him as a former alcoholic who shaped up after a DUI, he was gonna kill himself, etc. during this time we also got into a lot of fights about his band and lack of ambition and his band partner (ex gf who had tried to break us up at one point), and his inconsistency with his word. \n\nI got a job in his home state that was much better for me so we decided to move in October and he swore he’d be better here. Two weeks before the move, he ended up getting a DUI with a .26 BAC. I was furious. When I picked him up from the police station, he told me it was my fault because I never let him drink at the apartment (I had told him he had to slow down, so his solution was to drink while door dashing) I broke up with him. \n\nWhen we moved, I told him he had to get his own place but since he had an out of town gig Nov-Jan, that he could stay with me for a month. When he got back Jan 1, he just loafed around and smoked weed and played video games and I would ask if he was applying for jobs or looking at apartments or anything and he’d say he sent out like, one application. If I were him I would’ve been sending out like a hundred a day so this also frustrated me, as I felt like I was being taken advantage of. \n\nHe got a job beginning of Feb and moved out finally. We stayed in this state of pseudo togetherness but he kept drinking too much (not every night anymore, but still binging about once a month) and would get into fights and insult me. He kept talking over me and calling me ignorant. I have told him many times he’s a dick to me when he drinks and that I don’t deserve it. So I told him it was done. \n\nWhen he was sober we had a long talk about how we wanted to be in each other lives but that I think our priorities and wants are too different. I told him I want someone who has a steady job and can save some and travel with me (huge hobby of mine) and that I want to feel like someone’s partner, not their mom. I want someone who takes care of their emotional and mental health.\n\nHe lost his job after two weeks and just now got a new one. He texted me last night and wants to meet up in two weeks to discuss if he want to try in the relationship anymore. The things I wanted to see change- less drinking, more fiscal responsibility, therapy - are not things I think realistically there can be improvement in in two weeks. When I asked what he was hoping to accomplish in that time he said “I think I should have a routine with my job by then and will be doing my community service. This new job has insurance so I can get started with therapist and doctor. I plan on reconnecting with my friends and music”\n\nHe told me that he will not do longer than two weeks and that if I say I’m not ready, he’s going to walk away and that it may take years or possibly never for him to stop loving me enough to be his friend so to me it seems like an ultimatum.\n\nI had asked for at least six months for the break bc I feel like to see if things like him actually sticking to therapy and stuff are happening, that will take time and that’s the kind of effort I’d need to see but he said no, that that would kill him and he thinks I’d get a new boyfriend (even though that is the furthest thing from my mind, I’ve spent so long feeling like I’m taking care of him I just want to take care of me for a good long while)\n\n\nI know what I’ve listed is all very bad, but he does have good qualities and I do love and care about him. I just feeel like not talking for two weeks and then having to be like “yes I believe these things are in the works” is a lot to ask of someone who you’ve told you’ll change before and it feels like he has a gun to my head. I’m accepting he might be able to change but I feel like I’d have to see the work, which two weeks does not allow for.\n\nI don’t know what to do",

        "text": "I find myself in a situation I have no idea how to navigate and it leaves me feeling confused as if I don’t have the proper mental tools to deal with it. I think you’re all more experienced than me so I accept any kind of input.\n\nI (29f) have been with my bf (29m) for three years. We had a difficult time getting to where we are today due to past trauma but we’ve both been in therapy and our individual/couple health has improved significantly. My so had, unfortunately, a lot more to process than me. He told me things about his childhood that I consider straight up abuse. I also live with him so I see the effects of this neglect and how hard it is for him to process everything.\n\nYesterday, I was invited to his family’s house. These scenes are heartbreaking to me because all I see is my bf trying to connect with his parents (56f 55m) , talk about events that hurt him -and they mocking the fact that he has a therapist or invalidating his feelings/ occasionally saying they were wrong but never excusing themselves. Some of the subjects are extremely heavy for me (physical neglect) and I don’t know what to say so I kind of become quiet and zone out. His mother also has certain behaviours that remind me of my narcissist father (competing with everyone, being the center of attention) and I have a hard time connecting in any kind of way. It’s an intense scene and my so doesn’t realise how changed his personality is, it’s like he’s constantly trying to get their approval.\n\nLong story short, after the visit my bf had a huge breakdown and went back to his old coping mechanisms that I thought he overcame, he was verbally agressive to me and told me his mother told him she feels there’s something wrong with me because I don’t make an emotional effort to connect with her (he recently talked w her about a fight we had). He also said some v messed up things like the fact he wishes me to be more like his mother and also that ‘he’s her’. I realise the trigger was MIL who was overly controlling with him until his 20s when he couldn’t take it anymore and moved to a different state. He realises that but sais that he still loves her, she is a good person and family is the most important for him. He sais I shouldn’t judge her bc it’s his journey to take, but I can’t help to feel angry hearing someone talk about abuse so lightheartedly and jokingly. He also sais that her saying she was wrong is a huge breakthrough for him. Personally I think they should do better and I’m entitled to judge abusers and settle my boundaries.\n\nIs there a realistic way to navigate this?\n\nTl;dr my(29f) bf(29m) who made a lot of progress in therapy was triggered by his family and acted out telling me terrible things. I don’t know if there is a way to overcome this.",

        "text": "Firstly to put things in context, i'm a 26M and i recently broke up with my ex girlfriend. We were together for almost 3 years and to be honest, we had a really healthy and caring relationship. \n\nI can't complain for the most part, we had our good and bad times but it was mostly the good ones. I choose to cherish those.\n\nThe issue begins from the ending of our relationship...last year, she went abroad after getting an scholarship to study in Spain and before she left, we decided to still be together and to wait and see what happens with me. I was finishing my degree and after that i told her i was travelling to Spain and see if the lifestyle fit me and if i was comfortable, i was moving there with her.\n\nA few months went by, and by December of 2022, we broke up. To be short, she told me that those 3 months that we didn't see each other made her contemplate and she thought it was better for her to live independent and experience that lifestyle alone with her friends. \n\nJanuary: very tough month...i was heartbroken and my head was my biggest enemy. I did some nasty toxic shit like logging in her IG account and read her DM's...i find her talking with a guy (supposedly after we broke up, the dates proves she met him after our discussion, but it still a bit odd to me) and she dated a couple of times with the guy after work. But man, three weeks after you break up...strange.\n\nSo we argued, she tells me that she met him after our break up, that she still loves me and this is as hard for me as for her, etc etc. Typical stuff.\n\nWe tried to understand each other and to finish things in good terms for the sake of what we lived. But the thing that bummed me the most, was her indecision, her uncertainty of telling me how she was feeling all those months we were together and she was in Spain. She used to ask me when i was booking my flight ticket and at the same time she already wanted to be by herself. \n\nShe writing me she loved me in my birthday when i read a conversation with a friend of her the day that i logged in her account, telling her that ''i fell in love again'' implying she was already loosing feelings for me. \n\nShe told me that she didn't want things to end that way but she CHOSE to be alone over there. I don't makes any sense.\n\nIt's been three months since us finishing the relationship and idk how to feel anymore. We talked every now and then, every two weeks to see how we're doing and i always give the impression that everything is ok, but i don't feel everything is ok when i remember all this stuff. \n\n¿What you would do?\n\nTl;dr my ex gives me wrong signals",

A couple of months ago she said she wanted to talk and mentioned a couple of small things that she felt weren't working with us and asked if I had anything.

She's been either ignoring me or giving me short one word answers unless she's asking me to do something. She got annoyed while doing something yesterday so pretty much threw something off her desk and left it there. It was going to stain the carpet so I ended up cleaning it up. A couple of hours later she apologised but she refuses to put herself back on the waiting list for free therapy again since its a year long. I really don't know what to do.

He cheated on me once 4 years back, when he went into a relationship with another girl but that's a whole other story. anyway, after 6 months or so, I decided to forgive him and give him another chance and he was just perfect. What I did not understand was, his cheating had a mental effect on me. I would not like him touching me at all or kissing him. and I also started feeling trapped, But I still felt like I loved him, so I continued. I started thinking I was asexual and hence I dont like physical relations. We had also been long distance for almost our entire relationship except at the start, so when I moved to another country, we didnt think we would break up. I still wanted to explore options because I wasn't sure if I like sex or not. Being in another country kind of gave me the freedom and I conjured the courage to ask him for an open relationship, maybe not in those exact words. Anyway, I discovered that I love sex and it was just a problem with him. While we wouldnt discuss my sex life. I was sure that we were done. but I still kept him around for 3/4 months because I needed emotional support, which was very wrong of me and I did eventually breakup with him. But I cant shake off the feeling of being guilty I dont know why. \n\nTL;DR: help me understand where I went wrong. I obviously have issues but I dont want them effecting my other relations",

        "text": "Long time lurker first time poster. This is a  throwaway account for privacy, also not a native english speaker. Also I will be writing this in a fast phase. \n\nI met R when I was in college, she was my first real girlfriend at the time. She came from a wealthy family and I came from a middle class family. She introduce me to her parents when we were only 4 months in a relationship. She said that she don't want to hide our relationship with her parents. \n\nIn the beggining of our relationship her parents were a bit distant and disapprove with our relationship because I didn't came from a wealthy family. Nevertheless, R never back down and defended me to her parents. I on the other hand prove to them that I genuinely love R and that I'm not after their wealth. \n\nSoon after, they started to accept me and even invited me to some of their family functions and reunions (this is on her father's side of the family as her mother's side lives on the other side of the country never really had a chance to meet them in person). \n\nOn one of the gatherings of their family I met J her second cousin, she's a year younger than us. She also started going to the same university so we all usually hangout most of the times. In this one time we were hanging out in my place  R pulled me aside and told me that she notice J was being touchy and kept pressing her chest in my arms. I admit I didn't notice and when I did  it start getting to my head. \n\nYou see R and I had never been intimate with each other throughout the entire relationship we were already 3 years into the relationship when this happened. She said she want to save it till we were married and I respect that. I love R so much, but I admit that I was tempted to try and test and see how it goes with J. But I stopped that thought immediately and never went through with it.\n\nI didn't stopped hanging out with J but I distanced myself to her because I don't want to upset R more and destroy their relationship. J noticed and asked why I was distancing myself to her I explained and she understand that what she was doing was wrong.\n\n Before we graduated I proposed to her she said yes and we are very happy. 4 months in our engagement my buddies organize an early bachelor's party, because not everyone in our group will be able to attend the wedding I told them that in no way will I attend if they hire strippers they said of course they will not hire so I went. \n\nI admit I drunk so much that I passed out and had no idea what was happening in my surrounding because I was confident that I'm with the boys. I woke up in the morning with a splitting headache and saw I was naked and J was beside me also naked. I was mortified and didn't know what to do. I dressed myself and went outside my room some of my buddies are still passed out and some were cooking breakfast. I asked one why J is in here and he said oh her girlfriend went here last night to check in on us and she brought J along they also had a drink and J told them she's sleepy and went inside the room I was in to sleep. \n\nI rushed out and was contemplating whether I should tell R about what happened or not. I was nervous and didn't know what to do. I also felt sick not because of the hangover but because of what will happened when all of this came out. Then I received a message from J that said please don't tell R about what happened I know that was a mistake and that should have never happened. I promise I will keep my mouth shut and distance my self from now on. \n\nSo I kept it as a secret which was a huge mistake. During a family dinner on her  grandparents house J announced that she' 4 weeks pregnant and looked at me and told everyone that I was the father of the baby. Everyone kept silent then there was screaming match and a lot of not so nice words was thrown to me and J. Amidst all of this R kept silent, and never said a word. I was apologizing profusely begging her to forgive me. She just stand up and left, not long after her parents follow but her dad slapped  me before they left. I know I deserved that for hurting their daughter. And that was the last time I saw her. \n\nMost of their relatives especially J's parents  were pressuring me to marry J as soon as possible. But the grandparents actually want me gone. But I stepped up and marry her as I don't want the child to grow uo with no father. (I married J after the DNA test proved that I am actually the father.) Grandparents never really welcomed me to the family again eventhough I'm still invited to the gathering they just never looked in my way. \n\nR blocked everyone who pressured me to marrying J except for few cousins and her grandparents. Now after 4 years R is coming back her grandparents where having a golden wedding anniversary and I heard she's attending. I still love her that never change and I know I'm wrong to say this but J can never replace her. \n\nShould I approach R and asked for forgiveness or should I just let her be?\n\nTl;dr: Ex is coming back after 4 years Should I approach R and asked for forgiveness or should I just let her be?",

We don’t intersect at all professionally, so that’s why I agreed to go on a date with him when he asked me out.\n\nWe’ve been on dates for like 1 month and a half. We had sex, we’re not exclusive (though I’m not seeing anyone else) and we haven’t had a serious talk yet (so I’m not bothered if he sees other women).\n\nMy friend and co-worker, Anna, is going through a divorce. She was already hooking up with another co-worker when she broke up with her husband. We don’t have a lot in common in terms of interests, but she seemed very kind and nice, and not fake. After her divorce started, she slept around a lot and joked about finding a rich guy. She even asked how I found Max (he lives in a rich neighborhood) and what a catch he is.\n\nI took this as a joke, but I did tell her recently that I’m still going out with him. She seemed happy for me. Max doesn’t know we’re friends and afaik he barely knows her.\n\nThere was a team building trip this weekend (I wasn’t there), and long story short, Anna got drunk and ended up in Max’s bed, who was also drunk, according to her. She told me. She didn’t seem resentful, but rather said it to me as a warning that the guy is not serious and not worth it. \n\nI’m very confused. I don’t wanna sleep with him anymore after this but I don’t know if I should tell him. I really liked him, and wanted to take things easy, but I feel weird. I don’t wanna be friends with Anna either, but again, no idea how to navigate this.\n\nTL;DR: I was dating someone and my friend seemed supportive, but she slept with him.",

It was soon when I asked but I wanted to clear that I do not want an only sex relationship so that we both choose to stay or leave and not try more. He said that he really likes me a lot and he sees potentials but he want us to know each other better and I agree. After some dates I learn that he is moving and when I asked him what potential he was showing if he is moving he said that he wanted to try( distance relationship and see where it goes) .we leave this topic and the next days was really good in our conversation.  Up to 4 days before when he just disappeared.  I texted him but he doesn't even read it . I actually don't know if I must worry, get sad ,be clad if I just learn so fast that he ghosted me ,or wait .

Havent really wanted to mention this before but he is my manager.\n\nIts been very toxic over the past several months, in which its clear hes insecure from the way he is untrusting of me, judges the clothes I wear, swears at me &amp; overall just says things that are disrespectful too.\n\n(You can check my last post about this for more depth as to why I want to leave which should explain it)\n\nSo I’ve been trying to find a job for around 2-3 months &amp; have only had more success with the crappy paying jobs, which I cant take because I wont be able to afford bills, rent, household stuff etc. The ones around my current salary or more have not accepted me as they found people more qualified (even though I have years of sales experience?). (I have not used him as a reference so that is not the reason).\n\nALSO, I cannot complain about him to anyone as it is his company in which he is partnered with his best friend, and it is a small company so there is no HR, its just a small office of a few people. I dont really want to put in a legal complaint, I mean we both consented to the relationship even if it was unprofessional, &amp; dont want to go down the legal route as it would be stressful &amp; embarrassing too so that is not an option (even my family dont know about this relationship). And I definitely have to leave my job, we had an argument once &amp; was going to break up in which he said how i cant work anymore but then we got over it (so yes he will fire me, and if not, I’d want to leave anyway as we work in the same room &amp; i have to sit near him). His best friend (other boss) knows about us so would just support whatever my current bf says :/\n\nSo today Im thinking to just dump him even though I have no job to support me, I cant keep being in this relationship, its mentally exhausting, having to walk on eggshells constantly too. I dont have anybody to talk to about this as my friends think I left him months ago (I was embarrassed to say i didnt).\n\nMy only backup is to borrow money from my dad which I have been absolutely dreading to do as I didnt want to disappoint him but have already talked about how I need to leave my job because its depressing (not that im dating my boss). He said he will help me but sounded disappointed. I have never asked him for money before so its really embarrassing.\n\nPlease advise on the situation if you can. Theres the option of staying with him until I get a new job but it would mean having to deal with it all again. This has been depressing me &amp; I have even seen a counsellor.\n\nTL;DR - 25f need to leave a relationship with my 37m boss as its toxic and mentally draining, but it means I will lose my job &amp; have to borrow from my dad which is humiliating for me.",

I mean they literally got married without us knowing, only a certain handful of people knew.  I'm 15f and my brother is 15m. I've never felt at ease with my stepmother because of the situation. My mother died and my dad just remarried like 2 or 3 years later. Its been rocky with her, at the beginning I didn't care to listen to her and I just didn't like her. Fast forward to the present and I still don't feel like I could share important things with her and I don't want to ever. \nWe literally had to move because of her.\n\nMy problem is anytime something happens in the house, me or my brother is the culprit. If she can't figure out which one did it, she just chooses someone to blame. Yesterday the microwave stopped heating but still turns on. She came to the conclusion that one of us did it and that anytime she takes a step forward we always sabotage her by breaking something. I'm just mad because things break or need to be replaced. We're not out here to make trouble and destroy things. I don't get along with my brother but I can firmly say that he would never do this. If something gets broken by accident, its \"My kid would never do this (she has a daughter)\" or \"your kids have no manners\". I get along with her daughter but I can't help but feel a bias. I understand that its her bio daughter but she wants us to respect her but she can't even respect our feelings sometimes. The other day her daughter used the oven to make a cake and that was fine but when I do it, I'm wrong because the oven uses to much electricity and the bill is to high. I just want to know if I'm wrong for feeling like she doesn't respect us and how to approach someone like this.\n\nTl;dr - I feel as my stepmother doesn't respect us because of certain actions she does and sometimes how she speaks about us.",

I moved in with her and left my country for that. As many other, I've had a terrible past relationship --- I was cheated on and told that I'm worthless, and all that fun stuff we let other people do to us when no one realyy had been kind with us. I was young and mentally unwell, and though I'm still struggling with bipolar I'm a good partner. All jokes aside, I'm a great partner --- I cook, I listen, I'm always supportive. All our arguments resolve in 10-15 minutes of honest talking. Sometimes it did feel like I'm the one giving more --- but living with a shit ton of bad things that happened to me, I guess, it felt normal.\n\nShe's been talking with that woman --- we're all from the same social circle but I didn't interact with her that much, never liked her, really --- for over three month. I felt jealous at times but like a smart girl that wants (or wanted) the relationship to work I told her about that. She always said, don't be silly, I love you very very much. I feel so stupid even writing that. I noticed that while she was texting with her, she would turn her phone away from me. It's true we always know beforehand, right? We always feel what exactly is happening.\n\nShe's away for two days --- and I'm always messaging her helping with her trip and supporting her (clown emoji fml). I know it's not right but I know the password for her laptop --- she gave it to me, no stalking --- and I went in and looked trough her texts. And there they were. I miss you, I want to be with you right now, I want to look you and the eyes and hold you. Y'know sloppy lovey-dovey stuff. I thought I would vomit right there. So as it goes I cried, I called my best friend. I felt ashamed and somehow responsible. Then I felt angry. Now I feel nothing at all --- just lonely I guess. And betrayed.\n\nI did so much for her --- and she tried to sit on two chairs I guess. Having me, supporrtive kind giggly good fucking girlfriend. And her --- sexy manic pixie girl. I'm going to say everything it made me feel tomorrow --- I'm pretty sure she will apologize, but I don't see any other choice but to demand blocking that woman and having open phone policy. But is it even possible to trust someone again? It never got physical --- they live in different cities, but they planned to see each other. And me, beeing a food fucking partner, supported her, oh yeah, go see your friends, that's so nice! I feel dirty, I feel like I need to shower in acid. It would have gotten physical, no doubts there.\n\nI'm scared of tomorrow --- she obviously will try to defend herself. I will fucking bite myself if she has the audacity to call it just frienship stuff. Have anyone ever gotten out of emotional cheating and been happy with that person again? Or is it just a stupid dream?\n\nSorry for my English, not native and very angry.",

I consider my body quite sexy, despite having a relatively small chest (about 1.5-2 cup sizes). I used to have complexes about my chest and narrow hips, but over the past year, I have learned to love and accept myself. We are together for 4 years.\n\nMy husband (M25) and I go to the same gym where a fitness model girl also works out. She has a very large chest, a thin waist, a very big butt, pumped lips, and a cute face. I notice many beautiful people in the gym, both men and women, and I have long stopped comparing myself to them -- everyone comes to exercise.\n\nRecently, an unpleasant event occurred that made me feel very bad, and my self-esteem was shaken: my husband and I were lying down and watching something on his phone when I asked about favorite page in Safari (it was an instagram account). As it turned out, my husband deliberately found this girl from the gym and visited her account several times. He said he didn't masturbate to her, but he regularly got aroused. I asked him not to do it anymore, but I understand that I don't trust what he says or does.\n\nI know this is not as terrible as cheating, but it makes me feel very bad, and I have started comparing myself to other women again (especially women of that type).\n\nHow can I learn to feel better about myself, and what should I do in this situation?\n\nTLDR: My husband (M25) regularly visited the Instagram account of a fitness model from our gym, which made me (F25) feel insecure and triggered my comparison with other women.

Moved in 7 months ago and for me it feels like things have changed a lot.  I spend alot of evenings and weekends bored, I'm very independent and enjoy going and doing things on my own if no one wants to partake in them with me but I've curbed this as feels antisocial in a relationship.  I hate being cooped up on the house and I love being outdoors and doing new things . It feels like we now I've moved in we actually don't have that much in common and don't spend a lot of time together doing joint activities.  I don't like where he lives which is a daily struggle for me and have little interest in his passions and he likewise it would seem.  I feel our life goals are probably also not in align.  Sex has also took a turn for the worst and I now struggle to climax because it's much more rigid than spontaneous.  He's a lovely guy, has a good job, good values and can look after himself so not reliant on me at all and things are still ticking along in the relationship just fine, there's no drama we are both easy going, maybe a little too much so and we enjoy the time we spend in each others company. It is a me issue but I can't help shake that I don't feel he is the one because of our different interests and goals hence am I wasting my time I'm just living for the moment and I should be upfront about this.  It just feels like it's too early in the relationship to bring up things like long term plans. To note I have my own place so not reliant in anyway either and my worry is if I make such a definite decision now then leaves us no where to go in the future\n\nTldr: good relationship, have fun, not many shared interests or life goals, should I let it play out or not waste both our time",

We talked everyday and had an intense connection. after he went cold for a week i and angrily cut him off for not prioritizing me although he apologized. During 2022 we talked and flirted on and off all year but I was too scared to admit my feelings that I missed him and regretted being so rash and wish I had talked it out maturely. In February 2023 I was going to be in his town so I hit him up and he returned home early from seeing family to see me. he explained to me that he’s been going through a lot with his family and we seemed to get closer than ever. i only seen him for 2 days but we seemed to picked back up where we left off without any serious talks of exclusivity yet but still that intense bond. After leaving we texted for two days and then he hasn’t texted back since. It’s been 2 weeks.

        "text": "I’ve (26f) been with my boyfriend (28m) for about 4 years now. My boyfriend is a very handsome guy. When I met him, he had dreads, which were very attractive to me. In November 2021, he told me he wanted a change and wanted to cut his hair. I was all for it and very supportive. I was excited for him! He got his hair cut and he looked sooooo good. I was very happy with it. \n\nLiterally not even 2 days later, he decides he wants to go BALD. I thought he was joking and was like “Um?? Please don’t.” He was very adamant about this and went ahead and got his head shaved bald the same day. Like Mr.Clean bald. I hated it the moment I saw it. \n\nI thought maybe this would be a temporary thing or like a trial run, but he confirmed to me he is going to continue the bald style forever. At that point what can I do ? People are gonna do what they want. But if you ask me if I like it, the answer will be no every time. Because I don’t like it.\n\nFast forward to 2023 and I still don’t like it. At all. And I have been trying to ignore it trying to get used to it because obviously relationships entail so much more. But if I’m being 100% honest I really can’t seem to get over it. I hate how shallow it sounds but truthfully it’s not like being BALD BY CHOICE is normal at 28 lol especially if you are nowhere near naturally balding. And then he has the audacity to tell me I’m the only one who doesn’t like it. He’s tried to bring up me not being attracted to him as much as I used to, not wanting to have sex as much as I used to. But it’s like what the fuck do you expect if you change your whole appearance? I’m not typically attracted to bald men if I’m being honest. Idk? It’s one thing if he was actually balding or had a medical condition. Then I’d be understanding and have different views towards it. But he’s doing this by CHOICE. Because he wants to. And ok, do you. But why should I be forced to like it? Part of me wants to do the same thing, go Mr. Clean bald just so he can understand how I feel. But I don’t feel like doing all that to prove a point. \nHe will do things like go out of his way to wear hats and hoodies around me because he knows I don’t like it. I also don’t like when he does that either because he shouldn’t have to. \n\n I’ve talked to my therapist about this and she tells me I should tell him how I feel. Problem is, he knows exactly how I feel lol. It just really bothers me because I am genuinely trying to look past it, I have been since 2021. But it just isn’t growing on me at all and idk what to do. Call me shallow if you want, I’ll take it. But truth be told when someone does something and it drastically changes their appearance it does have a possibility of affecting someone’s attraction towards you. I had no idea I would feel this way. I thought I just needed to get used to it but I don’t know anymore. \n\nTl;dr my boyfriend went bald by choice a year and a half ago. I’ve been trying to get past it but I don’t know how.",

        "text": "I've been with my boyfriend for nearly 4 years. At the beginning, there was the classic honeymoon phase, with lots of kissing. That's how it was for the first 3-4 months. Since then, we have not once kissed outside of sex--and even that isn't common. Our last kiss was in September, I think. We have sex regularly (2-3x a week), so this isn't a dead bedroom situation, there's just no kissing.\n\nI can deal with that. It feels weird, especially when we're around other couples who freely express their love, but I'm a pretty reserved person so ultimately it's fine. He openly doesn't like affection, except very rarely when it's on his terms. I don't feel like I can reject him when it happens because then I'm wasting my limited opportunities. Hugging is fine--if he initiates. Cuddling he hates, but if he initiates I can have, like, two minutes of it. He doesn't like if I give him a quick peck on the shoulder, though, so that's out (he's done it before to me, though, when I was basically asleep, so again, it's only fine if he initiates). He touches me in public--a thigh caress, arm around my back, etc--a *lot*, but this behavior barely translates to at-home behavior and is the extent of the affection I get from him.\n\nHis love language is gift giving and I do receive a lot of little gifts regularly. But he can't, or won't, say I love you. I've heard it from him *once*, back in September. He also doesn't say it to his family, so it's not just me. Actually, when he said he loved me that one time, he followed it up by telling me he doesn't plan on saying it again. So I at least have my expectations curbed there.\n\nI want to be accepting of the fact he isn't affectionate. I love this man and feel otherwise compatible with him. But sometimes I just feel so lonely being with someone who doesn't want to hold my hand, or tell me good morning, or kiss me goodbye. And then I feel guilty because he'll get in a playful mood and I'll get a hug or he'll pick me up, and I feel like I'm crazy imagining him as this completely cold person. But then hours later he'll tell me not to touch him when we're in bed and I'll feel bad again.\n\nI'm just really struggling with this. The little we've discussed it has come down to \"this is just how I am\", which I already know. I also know from both him and various mutual acquaintances of his ex that in his previous longterm relationship, when she finally told him she had issues with this she was basically checked out of the relationship already and his attempts at improving for her failed. So he might be resistant to trying to change this about himself again. I don't really know what to do or how to approach this conversation with him again, if need be.\n\nTL;DR Boyfriend hates affection and physical intimacy (other than sex). I'm struggling with accepting this and often feel lonely. Advice?",

        "text": "Recently my boyfriend has been spending a lot of time with a new camel friend of his. They spend quite a bit of time alone together like walking his dog in the evening, going on walks to the park and getting dinner, spending sometimes even the whole day together. I’ve confronted my boyfriend on this three times already. I’ve asked him if he has any feelings toward her and he says no. He says he hadn’t cheated and promised me if he ever wanted to be with someone else he would first break up with me. We also in the same conversation talked about going long distance in the future. The hangout they had most recently looked romantic to me. He too her to the beach and they ate lunch  and dinner together. I saw her Instagram caption as well which said “today was cute and little little romantic” I talked to him about this last night again and he swears he has no feelings towards her. Am I being insecure having these feelings of insecurity or is my boyfriend just playing me and I’m stupid :/ ? \n\nTd:lr boyfriend is spending a lot of time with female friend in somewhat intimate settings and has said there nothing going on.",

        "text": "Please don't criticize me that I should know better being the older person. I need support, please and advice. I feel my mind is not clear.   \n\n\nI started dating him since Nov 2021 and since January 2022 he started to press to bare myself on cam and have sexual activity like that. We hadn't met at that point. He said that I'm the one that's hurting him, because I don't trust him or something of the sort. He relented for a while on various occasions.  \nWe met several times.\n\nHe started to threaten to break up with me many times, when we'd have arguments, usually about me complaining about his behavior and he'd accuse me back, or because of the cam thing. I would stand up to him, but as time went on I felt more exhausted. My life circumstances were not helping me, as I was most of the time alone, working from home, in a small town where I didn't really have friends.\n\nFrom Nov 2022 he entered officer school (Europe) and we spent less time together. He will graduate March 24th. I could still see making effort, while he seemed busy, to contact, talk. It fluctuated, but he'd tell me about his day in text, then give me some short calls or a few minutes during the day. In the evening, we'd spend half hour on cam, more or less. He told me to be patient because starting February he will go up one rank and he'll have more free time. He also started to press again for the cam thing, which he had stopped mostly since entering the army, or at least he didn't react negatively when I didn't. He started to become colder and colder as I was refusing him, not saying I love you, not contacting me, being short on reply. He started to complain about various things about me, one of them being that I am not sexual on cam and show all my private parts.\n\nIt was a very stressful period for me on New Year's Eve I lost my livelihood, a small business I had. I was in the middle of winter with bills to pay and a bit of savings. I'll start a new job on April 1st, in a different city and I don't have enough money to pay everything. He started to press me on Feb 9th and said he is breaking up with me, that I put him off about being closed, not being sexual on cam. Again I could not sleep for 48h, I was in shock and suicidal. The part about being closed is that he found on Holidays some antidepressants in my purse and I hadn't told him about those. I was prescribed those because he had threatened break up in October again over the cam thing and he was being very cold to me and I couldn't function, I was suicidal and hadn't slept in 48h. I begged him to not break up and eventually he agreed not to. I never told him about those, because I was afraid if I'd tell him his treatment was the main reason I was taking them that he'd get upset and he'd be angry and withholding again.\n\nBack to Feb 9th, again I begged him not to dump me. I also told him I had been sexually ab\\*sed in childhood so I would freeze over the cam thing. He said he is sorry I went through that and later that I should just get over it. I cracked and I did whatever he wanted sexually. He seemed very happy, attentive and affectionate, but it only lasted for some days, then slowly he started to talk less, prioritize me less. He had said us being sexual would bring us closer. If I was sexual I'd get a lot of anxiety and feel needy and scared. I would have been calm(er), but after the next day he'd be usually less attentive to me. I kept asking if he loves me, and he kept saying yes. He'd tell me that multiple times a day.\n\nA few weeks ago I told him I felt he lost interest and if that's the case he should tell me because I can understand people's feelings change. He told me he loved me more than before. I said that he is saying the words every day, but he does not spend time with me and I feel neglected, plus other things. He thanked me I said this to him, and said he'll put more effort in the future, because he is just tired and stressed and that the same had happened to his previous relationship, the girl dumped him because he was not being attentive to her because of his stress and she thought he didn't love her. (This part is true, as I knew him even when they were together, we were platonic, before dating, and he suffered for her.).\n\nEventually he lost his temper because the discussion was dragging on. We both spoke but I can repeat myself when I'm anxious. He became cold and withholding and didn't contact me for 2 days. After, he said he loved me but has some anxieties about us.\n\nThe only thing that changed was him saying good morning every morning first. Less effort in texting and calls as before or less in some days. I told him again I felt alone and he said there's nothing he can do and I'm making him sad saying that. But the thing is now I see him on social media for 1-2 hours every day almost, he plays computer games 1-3 hours every day. So to me it feels like he is using excuses and could carve time from that. Also it takes a few minutes to check in and send little texts.\n\nYesterday he told me good morning and I love you, I said it back, then nothing from him until 6pm. I called him we spoke 6 min and said he'll call later. At 8 30 pm he called me, he was getting ready for a game and asked to see my breasts. I said no and that I need companionship and time together for that. He tried to stream the game for me, and when it was no possible he said he'll close and wants to play alone, cold, no I love yous, and he says that at the end of every call. He said he'll call later. He called at midnight, but I missed it and minutes later he was in bed and said he has to close. I said I don't like that he stops saying I love you when I don't show him my breast on request and that I need time, intimacy together to feel sexual, otherwise I'd do it for everyone on the street and I'm asking for things normal in a relationship. He equaled him not saying I love you because I won't show my b00bs with me not doing it because he won't spend time with me. And now he's also not wrote, as he does every morning.\n\nHe also said in one oh our last talks he is tired of me doubting his feelings and that he feels it is established he loves me, he is with me and will be with me. But how can that be established if be breaks up every few months, and reacts like this at sexual stuff?\n\n**Am I being gaslit?**  \n\n\n Tl;dr:  LDR boyfriend stops saying ILY and contact if I don't do what he wants se\\*ually, last night he stopped saying ILY because I refused to show my b00bs. I told him I'm not in the mood because he doesn't spend time with me and I need intimacy to be sexual and i don't like his attitude. He said that me not being sexual is the same as him not saying ILY. In Feb he threatened break up  for not being sexual on cam and show everything and other reasons, and took it back when I cracked. He said this will bring us closer, but I don't see more effort. Say he's busy in officer school (Europe) but he has time now for video games 1-3h every day and social media (1-2h). He'll say a good morning and I love you and text a couple sentences throughout the day or less, then call in the evening for some minutes (5-10), sometimes 30 min, but he's usually also gaming when he spends more time with me like that. I asked if he lost interest and he says he loves me more than ever. I told him before I could see words and actions, but now he doesn't spend time, with me, among others.",

        "text": "He was in a long term relationship for 7 years, with a 3 year old child. They split 7 months ago, initially a joint, then his decision (separate bedrooms, no love, no affection. He says they were \"business partners\" raising a child). He goes to his ex partners house to see his child and will take the child out on day trips. Ex partner is understandably very upset by the ending of this relationship but he is resolute it is the right decision. He is open about his interactions with her and I do not think he wants her back/is giving her mixed messages.  \n\nI met him on a dating app 5 months ago. Initially he came on very strong, he was extremely affectionate and told me he could fall for me. I have since discovered he is a  very anxious person and i think this is typical of anxious attachment style? When he first met me he told me I was out of his league and struggled (still struggles) to always give me eye contact. He deals with a lot of guilt and catastrophising intrusive anxious thoughts. He keeps himself extremely busy as a distraction to this. For a long time he thought I was only interested in him \"because he's a tattooer in a band\", and has mentioned this twice. During one of our discussions about this I mentioned \"wouldnt you rather be with someone who gets attention from others but still chooses you every time?\" he made a vague \"well i wouldnt choose to be with my dream person anyway.\" comment. I wish id asked him more about this at the time. Why wouldnt you choose your person? He keeps himself extremely busy as a distraction to these feelings. He has recently started therapy. \n\nSince then we have continued to see eachother once or twice at the weekend (he lives some hours away). I have met his friends. But the compliments have dried up, he is very affectionate sometimes and other times not at all. We are \"exclusively dating\" but he has repeatedly told me he doesn't want a relationship \"at the moment\" because the idea of \"spending the rest of his life with someone is scary\". But why exclusively date me. As far as I can see there is no difference other than the dubious extra bit of social respect as being referred to as \"girlfriend\". He has jumped into his other previous relationships (living with a partner after a month of knowing them) so I don't understand what's going on. \n\nAm I beating a dead horse waiting for this guy to be \"ready\"? Should I give an ultimatum? I really want to be with him but don't want to waste my time.\n\nTl;Dr- guy I've been seeing for 5 months dragging his feet on committing to a relationship, but wants to be \"exclusive\". Is it anxiety or he's just not that interested?",

What should I do in this situation? \n\nTl:dr- recently bought a home for my dad and I. Have an empty studio and plan to rent it out to rent out to either bf or friend.

        "text": "Just explaining the plan since it gives context on where we are - we met on a gap year abroad and were together for about 7 months before going back to our neighboring home countries to save for our plan to move to Australia. She'd been planning to move there at some point in the next 2 years the whole time, and then when we realized we were going to be together long term it became the plan that I would go too. \n\nShe started her journey there 6 weeks ago, backpacking around Asia with her best friend and landed in Australia 2 weeks ago. I'm flying over there in 2 weeks.\n\nMy issue is this - communication completely broke down between us while she was away. Every phone call was a quick 5 minute call with her friend present in the room so we couldn't talk about personal stuff. Texts were typically once a day just before she went to bed and she'd fall asleep after 1-2 texts, so again we couldn't talk about anything more small talk. When she arrived in Sydney we spoke quite a bit for a few days while the girls were finding us a place to live, but now they've found somewhere, again it feels like my girlfriend has forgotten she's in a relationship. \n\nI'm the worrier in the relationship, and she knows that, which is why I'm not sure how to address this with her. I don't want to come across as needy or to make her feel like she HAS to talk to me because then it becomes routine and robotic. I'm sure she has no idea what effect it's having on me but to be honest it's deeply affecting my mood and I'm having thoughts a few times per day asking myself if this is grounds for a breakup or not.\n\nThe worst part is that I'm moving in with her in 2 weeks, and after 6 weeks of barely talking to her I'm going to feel awkward as hell around her. It sounds super dramatic but I almost feel uncomfortable moving in with someone when I don't even know if there's a relationship left.\n\nIs this worth bringing up or should I just ride it out until i'm there and hope it goes back to normal?\n\ntl;dr: about to move to Australia with my girlfriend but communication is dwindling and I feel uncertain about the relationship 2 weeks before I move.",
