        "text": "I just posted another story that was a little more negative, but after remembering this story, I felt the need to share it, too. Apologies for two posts so close to one another? \n\nSo husband and I are at the Long-line Car License Place, where no one ever wants to be, but I digress. We’re waiting in line, make it to where the benches are and sit. We’re just talking quietly or scrolling through our phones, when I suddenly tune in and hear an older man saying behind us “...you know, these kids these days just have no respect! You would think they’d give up their seat for someone elderly, but they don’t care, they just-“ blah blah blah, droning on. We turn to look and he’s speaking to an elderly woman directly behind us. She’s not really looking to conversate back with him it seems. So my husband just quietly stands but I ask if she’d like to sit, if so we have absolutely no problem moving. We genuinely just didn’t know she was there. And she’s so sweet, just said “oh no, that’s okay, I’m really fine but thank you!” And we smiled but stayed standing. \n\nSo the guy tries to lean into her a little more and says “oh they must have heard me.” So I turn to directly look at him and just smile and he starts back pedaling saying “I didn’t mean ALL young folk, there’s just so many today that blah blah, but I wasn’t talking about you guys specifically” and continues and I just smiled even more and said  “The only disrespect I’ve witnessed here is you speaking down about other human beings without thinking they’d hear you or respond to you appropriately. Have a good day, and feel free to sit here.” And turned back around to stand with my husband. There was a lot of snickering and he just finally shut up for the remainder of the time we were in the building.  I was extremely anxious and shaking from being confrontational, but it made me so mad and I felt the need to make him look stupid for his judgemental mindset. \n\nJust gross. You don’t know people and who they are, just remember that. \n\nOn the plus side, he didn’t bother that poor woman anymore either. ",

        "text": "So, to preface, my S/O and friends and I are fairly young, so we tend to have a high amount of respect for anyone in the service industry as we’ve been there or are there ourselves. We never get upset, we’re always super polite and tip overly well (I also work for tips), are patient, etc. but this experience was enough to anger most of us. I’m on mobile, so apologies for any formatting issues. \n\nI’ll try to keep it somewhat short. We went to a fairly popular place that grills your food on a giant stone with some friends and coworkers one Saturday night. Now, it was busy, it’s Saturday, but we called to make a reservation and were told about an hour. So we show up right at that hour mark, check in, and wait for a few. Twenty minutes goes by, and we’re still fine, maybe a little questioning and hungry by now, but fine. The hostess told us they were basically waiting on the other big group to leave from the large booth and table section to seat us. We’re fine! No big deal! \nMind you, we had 8-10 in our party. Big enough, but they sat two other large groups before us, as well as numerous small duos or trios. No big deal, they have smaller tables, but as we’re still waiting we’re wondering why they couldn’t just push tables together for us. \n\nSomeone inquires again after like 30 minutes and we basically get told the same thing and it may be another 15-20. One of our friends mentions they said that over half an hour ago, to my dismay lol, but. So hostess rolls her eyes. We end up waiting for almost an hour past our reservation time and they ask if we mind if they just push two round tables together that seat 6. We say yes please! We’re just hungry at that point. \nIt gets worse than a minor long wait issue. \n\nWithin 5 minutes of being sat, another girl comes over and says they have a reservation for one of those tables and if we can all squeeze at one round table and two of our group can sit at a small two person table next to us. We’re kind of just like “whatever” at this point. So our group gets separated. \n\nDuring eating, multiple things were forgotten, drinks came slow, waiter was generally forgetful. We don’t complain too much about it and we’re nice to him but it was an annoyance after annoyance. Again, they were busy. \n\nWe notice while we’re eating that the other large table that they “had another reservation for” so we had to split? It was for TWO PEOPLE. they could have sat at a two person table. We were livid at that. \n\nWe pay, we go to leave, one friend still never got his rice, but it’s whatever. We’re leaving and the hostess is cleaning the doors, had just friend-ily said goodnight to a few people walking out ahead of us and looked us dead in the face, made eye contact, and didn’t even offer a smile. Had the most RBF on ever and didn’t say goodnight. So as we’re walking out I finally had had enough and raised my hand in a wave and cheerily shouted “It’s fine, have a GOOD NIGHT!” \n\nWe had joked the whole time about yelping, but I honestly did after we got home. \nI feel bad, because it genuinely seemed like they just didn’t have a good staff together and had no idea what they were doing. But at the same time it felt like we were literally the only large group that was treated that way there. \n\nWe’ve never left a place angry in the slightest, but it was just a mess. We vowed to go to the other location forevermore. Please get your staff together and form a group-movement. Teamwork makes the dream work, people. ",

This is one of the times they did not hear me correctly.

        "text": "This just happened tonight!\n\n**TL;DR:** I get into an argument with an old Mother because she was being rude to a Waitress. I end up dissing her. Her entire family tries to shame me in front of the packed restaurant. I receive multiple thanks from waitresses, get some food comped, and have a great time with my table. The family glares at us while we have a fantastic dinner.\n\n**Location:** A local Italian restaurant, tiny venue, tiny kitchen staff, obnoxiously busy. Need a reservation. Dinners here usually take between 2-3 hours. I'm here with my mom, stepdad, brother, cousin, and two friends. The door to the waiting room/entrance is about 3 feet behind my seat, and the register is 3 feet to my right. Like I said, tiny venue. \n\n**Defending a Server:** I'm eating my starter salad when I hear a stressed-out waitress behind the register. She's talking to an older lady of about 50-60 years old (hereby \"Mother\"). \n\nThe Mother asks to see the manager. Surprise, there is no manager. Mother wants to see the owner. \"No, she's cooking. We won't be able to seat you if she stops cooking, because no one will be able to finish their dinner.\" (Excellent comeback, waitress!) Mother wants to stick tables together. Can't do that. \n\nThis goes on for a while. My attention is piqued. Then...\n\n&gt;Waitress: I'm sorry ma'am but I have to go help my tables, they're waiting for me. [starts to leave]\n\n&gt;Mother: [mocking voice] ooooOOOOHHHhhhHHH, heeeerrreee you go [implying that waitress is making excuses]\n\n&gt; Me: [turns around] What is WRONG with you?\n\nIt was loud in the restaurant and I got no reaction, so I assumed she didn't hear me. But five minutes later...\n\n&gt; Mother: Excuse me, I really don't appreciate the way you talked to me back then.\n\n&gt; Me: Well, I don't appreciate the way you were talking to that waitress.\n\n&gt; Mother: We've been waiting here an entire *hour* and we haven't been seated, and we have reservations.\n\n&gt; Me: And I'm very sorry for that, but you don't need to treat the waitress poorly. The restaurant is very busy, obviously. There's nothing she can do until someone finishes.\n\n&gt; Mother: Well you need to understand that my daughter is 6 months pregnant.\n\n&gt; Me: That's great.\n\n&gt; Mother: And she's very tired and needs to sit.\n\n&gt; Me: There's chairs outside, she can sit there.\n\n&gt; Mother: She *has* been, for over an *hour*. \n\n&gt; Me: [sarcastically] Well, maybe she needs to lie down in a bed.\n\n&gt; Mother: YES, maybe she DOES.\n\n&gt; Me: Oh! Then maybe you should *go home* with her so she can lie down.\n\n&gt; Mother: She's 6 months pregnant and we've been waiting an hour.\n\n&gt; Me: I know, and I'm sorry. But you don't need to be rude to the waitress about it. My 16-year-old brother has a better attitude than you! \n\n&gt; Mother: [huffing] *WELL* I'm feeling *very* sorry for my daughter right now.\n\n&gt; Me: I feel sorry for her too, because she has you for a mother.\n\nAt which point my stepdad audibly says \"ooohhhhh\" and my mom starts stifling a laugh. The Mother widens her eyes and stares in horror from me to my mom. My mom quickly waves me back to my dinner. The Mother eventually leaves to the waiting room without saying anything back. \n\nThe Waitress comes back to the register and I apologize for the Mother. Waitress thanks me for sticking up for her.\n\n**The Shaming:** The Mother and her family come in, finally ready to be seated. Her Son comes up to me with Mother in tow.\n\n&gt; Son: Did I hear you were talking back to my mom?\n\n&gt; Me: Yes, because was being rude to the waitress.\n\nThe entire family (6 people) start to loudly shame me as they walk to their table, just 5 feet away from ours. They're all saying different things. Highlights:\n\n&gt; Son: I think I know my mom better than you. This restaurant is a JOKE.\n\n&gt; Me: Then leave.\n\n&gt; Mother: [to my mother] You better not have been taking pictures of me [when you were taking a picture of your children posing for the camera]!\n\n&gt; My Mom: What?! Why would I take pictures of you, I don't want pictures of you!\n\n&gt; Lady 1 (Daughter?): [shakes her head, staring me down as she walks by] Shame on you. \n\n&gt; Me: You're having FIVE PEOPLE [I forgot the Mother] gang up on a 20-year-old girl and you're saying shame on ME?!\n\n&gt; Lady 2: You need to stay out of other people's business. You don't know anything about what's goin-\n\n&gt; Cousin: YOU WEREN'T EVEN IN THE ROOM!\n\nThe Waitress runs between us and tells us to chill. She sneaks in a \"But thank you, I really appreciate it\" to me. My table gets back to our dinner. I'm shaking and feel like throwing up, but I try my best to get it together. \n\n**The Blast:** For the next hour or two, both the Waitress and our own waitress came up to our tables to thank us multiple times. One called me the \"hero of the night\". They comped our two plates of garlic fingers, which was nice of them. It was a bit hush-hush, but if the other family tried, they could definitely hear the waitresses doing all of this. I hope they did.\n\nWe ate lots of food, laughed a ton, had a great time. Meanwhile, random family members would turn and glare at me, especially whenever I was laughing. Maybe they thought I was laughing at them? \n\nAnyway, we get up to leave, and the ENTIRE family is blatantly staring at us. Then my stepdad stands up. He's a tall, big guy, worked construction his entire life. And he looked back at them. They stopped staring after that. We walk out and have yet another laugh at their expense.\n\nThe best part is that I have more of those comped garlic fingers to eat tomorrow.\n\n**Edit**: A lot of people are commenting, so I just wanted to say that I do NOT think an hour wait with a reservation is reasonable and I truly feel for the Mother and her family. Not sarcastic. I would be frustrated too. It sucks and the restaurant definitely should have given them a discount or something, I don't know if they did. I also think my diss was rude and unreasonable, but I did say it, so it's in the story. Anyway, thank you for reading!",

        "text": "I finally got into a tile store as we are going to redo our bathroom. I spent over 2 hours looking around a store and picking out just the right tiles. I decided to buy some samples to take home so I could assure the color and size would go well. I bought two 12 x 24 tiles and an accent tile. The sign said it was a $12.99.  I get up to the register and the bill comes out to approximately $48.00.  I was surprised and asked the cashier to confirm the pricing that something is wrong because this was quite high. She looks at the tile back and then the receipt and says \"Nope, that is how much it costs.\" I replied \"Sorry, I am confused because I thought the sign said something else.\" But I still pull out my card and start the process of paying it. The clerk cops an attitude that this is how much it is and did I want it or not! (Really super bitchy). by this point I'm almost completely done with the credit card purchase. The lady behind me was kind of enough to tell me that it was more than likely $12.99 per sq. feet and since each tile was 2 sq. feet that it was $24. which made sense! The cashier could have told me this but for some reason did not. The transaction goes through and I did not say anything to the cashier. She was so mad at me that she threw the receipt at me. The lady behind me told her to stop the attitude and learn how to explain their pricing to customers. After my purchase, I went back to where my tiles were at and indeed confirm that it just said \"$12.99\" it did not say per sq. feet or anything else. It had the full box price too. Apparently, there is a sign in the store that was 8 x 11\" that makes a statement where it explains that prices are per sq. feet but that was to the left when you walk into the store and not the right side where I walked in.

I scheduled for the service guy to come to my house at 1:00P-5:00P. Also had my number down for the secondary number, so if no one answers the first number (which is my landlord number, than they will call my number). I also had them make a note to just call my number first. \n\nI got off work at 12:30P (hence the reason for the 1:00P schedule time). I made it to my house at 12:50, enough time to run in and lock my dogs up, and clean the house a bit before the service guy came. BUT when I got home, the service guy was parked (front of van facing the street) in my driveway, so I had to park on the street, and I walked in front of his van to get to my house. He was sitting in the van, I waved to him, and ran in the house to locked my dogs away. When I came back out to tell him it is okay to come in, HE WAS GONE. \n\nHe left a note in the door saying \"Sorry I missed you, came at 12:45pm, call 'this number' to reschedule\" \n\nSo I called the number and the conversation goes as followed: C for customer service lady and M for me\n I told the customer service lady what happened, and that he was on my property when I got home.\n\nC: \"Well it shows he did call the number that was on the work order\" \nM: \"But he didn't call my number\"\nC: \"But he called one of the numbers that was on the work order\"\nM: \"Than why ask for a secondary number if he won't use it\" \nC: \"He called the number that was on the work order\"\nM: \"okay fine, than why did he come early 12:45pm when I got on my WORK ORDER that the service is for 1:00pm to 5:00pm. \nC: They some times come early if they are running early. \nM: I was technically here when he come so why didn't he come in when I waved at him, and he waved back? \nC: I dont know what to tell you, I can call him or another service member to come tonight, but if not than can we reschedule. \n\nFrom there is was like talking to a robot, they took no responsibility for their worker. At this time I had no washer for a week due to them being over booked, and ended up having to wait another week for someone to come out. \n\n\n",

So I’ve been surviving through university/college for a couple years now in a new city through tactical thriftiness and Student Specials and whatnot and one particular restaurant has earned a special place in my heart because of it’s terrible customer service.  So this place was promoting a $7 dinner special which was basically just a chicken schnitzel and chips. So my 3 roommates and I were all eager to give it a crack. We walk into this place only to see one waitress behind the counter and 2 other older blokes having a beer at a distant table. No one here? Lovely, should be a smooth transaction. (‘fraid not) We all order the $7 special and pay separately with Credit Cards. But as the 4 of us order there seems to be a progressively more puzzled look on the waitress’s face. Didn’t think much of it and just moved on. After we each order we’re asked if we want a copy of the receipt but usually that’s unnecessary, we get our table and sit down. About 45 minutes into and finally we’re greeted by 2 $7 specials and we ask “Where are the other two? And the lady who served us looks at us all like we were criminals. She darted back to the register screen and started smashing at the screen like a Earth, Wind &amp; Fire Key-tar solo. Comes back and tells us “I’ve only got 2 payments...” Besides the 2 old guys we are the only people in there. She gets the manager, some big burly fella who comes out and will only be satisfied by a banking app receipt which we can provide. He apologises &amp; all is well, one $7 comes out in like 10 minutes, but no second one for my remaining hungry roommate. I’m dying from laughter at this point, I am beyond entertained. We get the manager a second time he apologises and offers a drink. My roommate says “Oh can I get a Vodk-..” NOPE! No spirits mate, too pricey! he proclaims, so he gets a beer and 10 minutes later the final $7 special arrives. I try and go back there as much as possible, I have gone there twice and each time I’ve witnessed some form of tomfoolery including a Chicken Wing Topping argument. But that’s a story for another day...",

At the pickup time, they will tell you if they had to substitute something, or just couldn't provide the item. There have been a couple of issues with the wrong number/weight of items substituted, like giving me 1 thing from brand y, when I ordered 3 of brand x. The brand wasn't the issue, it was that I needed more of whatever for meal I was planning.  When this had happened before, I didn't know till I got home and unpacked. This time, it was bread, which they bring to you in the front seat because it's fragile.\n\nThis time, I had ordered 2 bags of hamburger buns, each bag with 8 buns. He advised me that it was a different brand, I said fine, didn't care. But then as he is loading the rest, I look at the bag to see what I got, and there is only one bag.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nMe: Hey guy, is there the other bag of buns back there?\n\nGuy: No, it's in there, it's giant.\n\nMe: ????\n\nAt this point I pull out the order conformation, and see that yes, I ordered 2 8-count bags, and it substituted 1 bag, and I look again to make sure, yep, this bag only has 8\n\nMe: Hey, I'm sorry, but this bag is only 8 buns, I ordered more than this...\n\nGuys: No, that one is giant!\n\nMe: Ok, what are you meaning by \"giant\"? This is 8 buns....\n\nGuys: Let me go get my dept manager, maybe he can explain differently....\n\nHe walks into the building, a couple minutes go by, and he comes back out and gives me a 3rd brand of buns, says \"here\", then walks away again.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI'm still not sure if he ever understood what the issue was, if his manager had to explain, or if they just told him to take me another bag to get me to go away. One of the few times when I've wanted to ask a person if they had been taught to count.",

I, my dad and my brother were going to the cinema and like everyone else we weren't going to be paying for overly expensive drinks and snacks there. \n\nSo my dad sends me to a supermarket store located in the same shopping centre to get some coke. He sees a promotion for 500ml coke bottles, it was two 500ml bottles for 6 zloty(1.5 euro) or something like that.\n\nSo i get the money of him. Hes a bit tight with his money so he gives me exact change. I walk over to the freezer and grab the coke. Now heres the important bit. I looked at the 'price' on the fridge for the coke and it was the same as the promotion. The price is located on a card slipped under the plastic cover on the edge of the shelf like at any other supermarket. \n\nSo i go to pay. The lady scans it. Says i need to pay twice the price of what it said on the fridge basically. I mention promotion. She says no and says that she will call someone over to check the shelf. That person (unknowingly to me) procedes to change the price on the shelf and comes back to say im wrong. I go over to fridge and see the price is different, feeling like im in inception or something at this point.\n\nDad comes over and argues with the manager that they tried to fuck over a kid etc gets a bit heated we get the promotional price in the end.\n\nIm guessing what happened was that the promotion ended but they didnt update the prices yet that day even though it was the later afternoon. Never came back to that shop ever again.",

        "text": "Picking up one of those online order stuff. The lockers that are storing those are behind two of the checkout lanes, which means whoever’s in those lanes that shift will have to handle customer pickups. Weird design, and I can already tell the cashier that I’m dealing with is hating it. I would too.\n\nWhen I walked in there’s this one guy before me getting loads of stuff. No biggie, I’m not in a hurry. However, this guy is different. It’s the kind of guy that when you see him you’ll think he’s gonna strike up some conversation with you, any conversation. I kept my head down to prevent any eye connection.\n\nHe started talking about his daughter with the cashier passionately. Which is fine, some dads are just so proud of their kids, but the cashier started become half-minded. I think the cashier guy knows what’s coming to him....\n\nWhen the cashier finally finished scanning his items and told him the amount, the guy said..”I told you, this chip is gonna fail 3 times before it works”...I was like, damn, a regular who the cashiers hate. I’m staying in this lane no matter what just to see what happens.\n\nYep, the guy’s card was declined for like 10 times, and the cashier was just like, “oh, try it again then..” or like, “we’ll insert it again and see” and bunch of half-hearted comments, while acting like about to yawn. This guy, while being declined so many times, just keeps talking about random stuff, like how he got this card because this store is running some promotion or something...the cashier did not seem to care about any of that...\n\nBut all of a sudden, it turned into a huge rant about how the credit cards just doesn’t work, and how like he can’t swipe anymore, everywhere now needs a chip and stuff. He just turned so angry so quickly it actually caught me by surprise (I’m still looking at my phone). When I finally looked up, this guy is still yelling, like nonstop, and the rants turned into how all these things the store is doing is not helping the customer, it’s not his fault the card gets declined, it’s the chip and how he can’t swipe anymore because this new card the credit card company send is just faulty. Dude, you got kicked in the head before you came? Your card is DECLINED!\n\nAs I’m looking at the cashier though, I witnessed the greatest thing I’ve ever seen someone working in customer service do. He had one hand on the counter, leaning to the counter, the other hand playing with his phone, swiping down like he’s on facebook. He pays no attention on what this dude is talking about, and at this point his face clearly shows that he just doesn’t give a f anymore. He hits one key on his cashier keyboard constantly as the dude insists on trying swiping and inserting. Finally, the dude gives up, and manages to find some cash somewhere on him to pay. All this time, the cashier did not pay any attention to this dude, nor did the cashier attempt even to engage in any conversation at all besides regular checkout dialogues.\n\nWhen it’s eventually my turn, I can finally see this cashier actually had a earphone on one of his ears lol. He did not care, not a bit. He must have put the earphone in when he dude started to rant. Imagine that. He did take it down before processing my stuff, but still, I’m just amazed on how he can just stand there, not engaging in any of this dude’s anger and just casually chilling. He did not care if the dude’s card is declined, he can just stand there all day clicking on the keyboard for him to try again, all while acting like his ear has noise cancelling superpowers. He was legit just chillllll...The dudes anger leads to nowhere, and just huge brick wall of this cashier’s don’t-give-a-fxxx-ness. I’m just behind all of this, in awe.\n\nAfter that, I just have so much respect for this cashier. I’m sure even if the dude files a complaint, he would just wipe it off like nothing and never let a rude customer bother him at all.",

When you get there, you look on a specially designated shelf for your order and be on your merry way. I've never had any issues with this system until today....\n\n\nI place my order, get the confirmation email and drive to the restaurant. When I get there, my order is not on the shelf... but it's lunch rush so I think maybe they are behind. I wait a few minutes... I notice my name isn't on the electronic board of ordered being prepared/completed either. It's now several minutes past the time my order should've been ready, so I ask an employee standing next to the counter about it and proceed to have the following exchange:\n\n\nEmployee 1: Did you get a confirmation email?\n\n\nMe: Yes\n\n\nEmployee 1: Are you sure you placed it with this store?\n\n\nMe: Yes\n\n\nEmployee 1: Let me see your email. \n\n\nI show her my phone, and she sees it was indeed the correct store so now she asks the folks on the line if they have this order (Nope) and one of those employees takes my phone, reads the  email and starts questioning me.\n\n\nEmployee 2: Are you sure you got a confirmation email?\n\n\nMe: Well yes, that is what you are looking at... \n\n\nEmployee 2: I think you placed it with the wrong store. \n\n\nMe: As you can see, on the email, it's the right location....\n\n\nNow here comes Employee 3: Let me see the email! \n\n\nThey proceed to have a 5 minute conversation about my order. I remained calm through all of this but after the fact I'm kind of baffled. How many people does it take to read that email and see I did place an order and just make my one salad already? They spent more time trying to prove me wrong than it would've taken to make my salad. They finally decided to make it, and when they handed it to me, I thanked them and noted this has never happened before and I just got a \"whatever\" from the employee. \n\n\nI'm not a scammer... I paid when I ordered and the charge had hit my bank account already... I stayed calm and was polite and that's the service I get... pretty disappointing. \n\nUPDATE: I did reach out to customer service and they did say there were having some technical issues, but noted the employee behavior was unacceptable. I ended up with a reward for a free meal which was immediately loaded on to my reward card. I am satisfied overall with the response I received. ",

We are both in our early 20's but we look quite young, and I always worry about being viewed as a poor tipper just based on my appearances. \n\nOur service started out well, there were only two tables seated when we walked in and we were seated immediately. The food and shakes came out quick and everything was fine. While we were there, the two other parties left and three more tables were seated (all only two people), so it wasn't busy at all. Our waitress only briefly walked by and asked how it all was once; other than that, she only came by our table to take our orders and deliver our food. Not a huge deal, I don't need someone refilling my water or clearing my plate at a restaurant like this.\n\nIf you're unfamiliar, at this restaurant, the waitress brings you your check (usually before you're done eating) and you pay at the front on your way out. We waited for twenty minutes, watching as all the other tables were served their receipts with their food. We weren't majorly bothered, but we couldn't even get anyone's attention. Finally, we both just walked up to the cash register. I was holding my milkshake, because I wanted a to go cup for it. \n\nOne waitress was sitting on a bar stool next to the register, texting on her phone, and didn't bother looking up at us. I have bad anxiety so speaking up to her was out of the question. Finally, one waitress glanced at me, before going behind the counter and getting a to go cup for my milkshake. She hands it to me and says \"have a nice day\" then walks away.\n\nMy girlfriend looked at me and asked if we should just leave. After a few more moments, I agreed and we walked out without paying. We left a few dollars on the table as a tip before we'd ever stood up, but that was it. No one stopped us when we left, or stopped us in the parking lot.\n\nIt was a weird experience all around, but I have honestly never been treated so oddly at a restaurant.",

The cinema we were at was quite small so even just a few people could make the place look crowded. \n\n\nBefore the movie started, this lady sat on the row of seats in front of us but a couple of seats to my left. When the trailers for other movies started I immediately notice this lady in front of us because she was using her phone and the screen was really bright. I get kind of annoyed but I give her the benefit of the doubt and just thought maybe she was just putting her phone on silent and the movie hasn't started yet so maybe it was fine.\n\n\nThe movie starts and I am enjoying looking at Chris Pratt when I notice the lady whip out her phone again still with the brightness up. Her phone was so bright I could almost see who she was chatting with on messenger and how many people she was chatting with. I think maybe its important or an emergency but she just keeps whipping her phone out every few minutes.\n\n\nI start thinking of ways to maybe call her attention like throw a piece of popcorn at her phone but I did not have good aim and I might hit someone else. Now instead of watching the movie peacefully, I get distracted by this bright phone flashing up every once in a while.\n\n\nI get really angry and I have had enough of this rude lady so I decide to be rude my self. Honestly not my proudest moment. I stretch my leg across my girlfriend's legs and kick the back of the lady's seat a couple of times (I am quite tall so I could reach the back of the seat with the tip of my shoe) until she notices me. I admit I may have kicked a bit too hard because I saw her head jump forward slightly. She turns her head towards me which I didn't expect because I didn't think she would know it was me. I also couldn't see her face clearly because of the dark cinema but she could probably see me due to the light coming from the screen. I look at her and say the word \"PHONE\" without making the sound as I am waving my hand downwards hoping she'll understand.\n\n\nShe turns back to the screen and slightly crouches to hide her phone. I get a rush of adrenaline like I usually do when I confront people and now my heart is beating faster than when I was watching the movie. During the rest of the movie the lady still kept using her phone but this time tries to make an effort to hide it. I can still see a little bit of the light from her phone but I just try to ignore it and try to enjoy the movie but that lady kind of ruined the moment for me.\n\n\nWho the heck uses their phone in the cinema and with a really high brightness that people behind you could read what you are texting. I've seen a lot of people do this in cinemas but this was my first time when I confronted someone about it. Am I  the only one that gets annoyed by this?",

        "text": "I'm a teenager, and my family and I went to the beach 4 days ago. After the beach, we decided to go to this local business (so local that the restaurant name includes the name of the town). This business is a restaurant that makes only hot dogs, hamburgers, onion rings, chips, and fries dressed up different ways. Nothing fancy. There's only like 15 things on the menu. The place is really small, but has a bunch (22?) of people in it. Most are already eating, a few families have ordered and are waiting for their food. We decide what we want, most of us only getting one thing (like one hot dog or only fries), since we wanted to go get ice cream after. Now, since my brother stayed home, there were 6 of us. We expected there to be a wait of maybe 30-35 minutes, since hot dogs don't take very long to cook, but there was a group of 4 and a group of 3 in front of us. Cue 50 minutes later, when neither my family nor the group of 4 in front of us have gotten their food. The group of 3 did at about the 40 minute mark, but the restaurant forgot their onion rings, and one of their hot dogs was cold. My parents ended up talking with the group of 4 about our frustrations with the wait times. In the 50 minutes we had been waiting, both of our groups had witnessed multiple solo people and one duo come in and get food after us. I get serving two or three solos before us, but they had basically abandoned both of our groups all together. The group of 4 had been waiting a little over an hour. My dad gave it another 5 minutes, and then he asked for our money back and we left. We drove to the ice cream place, ordered and ate food from there (this place has chicken tenders and burgers), ordered and ate our ice cream, and got in the car to drive home in less time than we were waiting in the hotdog place.",

        "text": "Sister and I went to a family-owned vegan restaurant that we've been to twice before, but ordered something that we haven't before at this particular restaurant. Something about us--we don't really like it when the food is unbalanced, for example, if it's a rice dish, not enough rice and too much of the other ingredients or too much rice and less of the other ingredients. In this particular case it was too much veggies and not enough noodles (there was barely any noodles despite it being a noodle dish--it was 90% veggies and 10% noodles). We had no idea the proportions of ingredients of the dishes we ordered since again, it was the first time we had gotten these dishes. Anyway despite not being fully satisfied with our experience we both insisted on paying but the two employees (I have no idea if they're part of the family that owns the restaurant) kept on insisting to waive our meals when we both tried to pay with our credit cards (every time we insisted on paying because we felt bad they would insist on waiving our meals because they felt bad that we didn't 100% enjoy the food). We had no cash on us to leave as tip for the trouble but I remembered that I had $15 in rolled quarters (from my accumulated tips from my serving job) in the car so I went out to the car, grabbed it, and gave it to them as both tip and also because it covered the cost of our meals. But honestly it was a very awkward experience. ",

        "text": "So my birthday was in the beginning of May and I just remembered I wanted to tell this story of a restaurant who rolled with the punches really well and handled themselves the best they could. \n\nBackground: For my birthday this year I wanted to go to a restaurant that I had never eaten at (I’ve been there once to go to their bar area but never for dinner). It was right beside an imax theatre where we were going to go see Avengers at for 10 pm and I had heard great things so I was psyched! 4 days before the date I called to make a reservation for 9 at 7pm. The guy on the phone sounded distant and busy but we got all my info, he repeated it back to me, everything seemed good to go. I had this feeling in my gut that maybe I should call the next day and make sure but my memory sucks and he did repeat the info back to me. \n\nThe day of the dinner: \n\nAbout 10 minutes to 7 I meet up with my family and we go inside the restaurant lobby. My dad and I go up to the host stand and let them know our reservation and everything. There are two girls there, H1 and H2. H1 was very apologetic and was trying to see if it had gotten scrambled by name, phone number or date. H2 got an attitude and told me straight up that I had called OTHER location like most people usually do. I physically went through my phone log and said ‘look, is this your number? It’s my only outgoing call that day. I called Wednesday and I spoke to a male host.’ She just replied that it was their number and left to go talk to the manager. \n\nH1 finally conceded defeat, there was no reservation. If we wanted to wait it would take about 45 minutes to get together a table for all of us because it was a busy Saturday night. My dad was pissed, and some of my family members were moody because they thought it was extremely unprofessional. Some of them suggested going to another nearby restaurant but I said we’d probably be waiting anyways so we’ll just wait here unless everyone wanted to go to some fast food place instead? None of my family or my boyfriend had eaten here before and I wasn’t going to let one mistake screw that up, and the one host was trying very hard for something that wasn’t even her fault. \n\nThey managed to get us a table in about 30 minutes and the rest was amazing. The server (who coincidentally happened to be a friend of a friend of my brothers) was awesome, the manager felt bad about the botched reservation and gave us some free apps and the steak was delicious. Everyone loved their meal and we ate, drank (well I drank, enough to embarrass my sister who thought I’d start confessing my love for Spider-Man during the movie if I was still drunk during it) and had a great time there with enough time to spare for us to get to the movie and get all our popcorn and stuff. The movie was awesome too so it was a great birthday! \n\nMy boyfriend and I have gone back once since and tried some other stuff and it’s definitely in my top restaurant list now. \n",

        "text": "Trying to a coffee from a chain coffee place at the airport the other day.  I ask for a strawberries and cream drink, but made with coffee instead of cream, and with a mocha drizzle on top.  I pay, and a second staff member starts to make it.  She tells me they don't do mocha drizzle, only caramel.  Annoying that no one told me before I paid, so I could order something else, but okay, I can deal with caramel instead of chocolate, not a big deal.\n\nShe makes the drink and it's pure white.  I ask \"are you sure this was made with coffee?\"  She insists that it is, and I think, okay, normally I get this in an opaque cup so I don't know what it actually looks like, maybe all the other stuff hides the colour of the coffee.  I try it, and it blatantly does not have any coffee in it.  I take it back and the staff member tries to insist that it was made with coffee flavouring, which is what I asked for.  It's not; I just ask for a refund instead.   There are like five coffee places within spitting distance, I'll just get something else, maybe with the mocha drizzle I wanted in the first place.  She agrees to a refund but then remakes the drink instead.  I repeat that I asked for a refund and she tries to argue that she offered to remake it and I agreed.  That didn't happen.  I mean, if she'd tried arguing that she'd heard 'remake please' when I asked for a refund, that would make at least a bit of sense.\n\nAnother staff member intervenes at that point, and offers to sort out the refund. At first she offers to refund it back onto my card, but then tells me she can't do that and offers cash instead.  Again, not ideal, because I'm just about to fly to another country and don't really want to carry a pocket full of local change around, but maybe I can just spend it on the plane.  In theory, this staff member is doing all the right things; she's sorting a refund and insists on remaking the drink in a larger size, even though I don't really want it any more.  Despite the correct, probably corporate\\-approved actions, she's really rude; she keeps cutting me off whenever I try to speak and rolls her eyes a couple of times.  I try to give her feedback about selling me something they can't actually offer, and she interrupts to tell me that they can easily put mocha drizzle on top of my drink.   That's annoying.  I mean, the pump is literally right next to the caramel one, where was the confusion?  Happy ending, I get my drink and my refund, end up throwing half the drink away because I'm sick of the whole debacle and get a coffee on the plane instead.",

        "text": "So this is a story from me, who was going to a three letter pharmacy a few years ago for the first time, not exactly knowing how pharmacies work in this country. I’ll bet this might not be an interesting story to most of you, but this one is a dumb one, and I still think it’s funny of me to even ask that question.\n\n\nSo a few years ago I had to go to the dentist for the first time I’ve arrived in the country. I was done with the dentist and the nurse told me to just take that prescription and go to a pharmacy. She had a good laugh when I asked her just “how” to fill a prescription, actually, she laughed already when I asked her what “fill” means. But she knows I’m new to this entire system, so she took some time out of her schedule to kinda explain to me what to expect when I get there. Just a quick background here. Where I’m from the doctor’s offices also operate small pharmacies and you don’t actually need to go to a real pharmacy when you’re going to your doctors.\n\n\nNow, when I got to the three letter, it took me a while to understand there’s an insurance card, and there’s a prescription card. Luckily I had it in my wallet, thinking that I might need it one day. The entire process went very smooth, and the drugs I’m getting is just like painkillers anyways. When I got to the counter to pay, I see the amount is only 16 cents or something. Somehow in my mind I figured the amount is too small that the machine won’t allow a credit card to process. I actually asked the technician ... “Can I pay with my credit card on this amount?”\n\n\nIf you ever physically see a question enter someone’s ears and confuse them so much that they ceased operating as a functional human being, that’s exactly what happened to the technician...her mouth was open for like 3 seconds and then she goes, “umm yes? Wait hold on, let me as...wait no, I think, well... actually, you can pay with cash, wait why wouldn’t it work?... I think it does right? Well yes the machine works on credit cards!”\n\n\nAt the time I thought I was asking the legit question and I don’t understand why she had to say all of that and confused about it. When I got home it kinda started dawned on me...the technician will not care if that machine works with credit card for not. They’ve been working for years with people paying with cards, why wouldn’t it work for me? It’s like asking a hotel front desk if their WiFi works with iPads....Umm yes it does?\n\n\nAfter that encounter, I tried to make my visits to the pharmacy as short as possible and avoid any eye contact to her again lol. However, this would be one of my funny stories when I first arrived here, and at this point I’m just glad she didn’t say “Yes it does, dumbass!”",

When all of this was done, my total was $86 and change.\n\nI told the cashier (a young lady, probably still in high school) that she must have scanned one of the items twice, because that didn’t add up.  She assured me that she hadn’t.   I stopped her, asking her to just do the math.  10x7.99 (plus tax, .48), less $7.00 in coupons.  This young lady wanted none of that.  She told me she would do the math after she counted the line items.  \n\nShe couldn’t view the line items on her screen for some reason, so leaned over the counter to scroll on the tiny credit card machine, trying to count there.   It was impossible, so she called her manager to help.  When all was said and done, she apologized and I went on my way.\n\nWhen did we stop teaching basic math in school????",

I told him of course not and sat on a nearby couch. \n\nNow, this woman payed the employee no attention while he went through her books, eyes glued to her phone. The employee picked up a bible out of the box. \n\nE: Ma’am, we actually don’t buy religious books that aren’t from direct distributors.\n\nHer head shot up and she let out an extremely loud and dramatic screech.\n\nBL: NO! No! I do not want to sell my bible. Why is that in there?

I had just received my eight week old golden retriever puppy from the breeder.  I’d travelled to see and select her a few weeks previously, and the breeder sent her to my town via airplane when she was old enough to fly.   I, naturally, had arranged to take her to be checked over by a vet early the next morning.\n\nIt was my first visit to the practice, so I wasn’t familiar with the staff.  I arrived with my bundle of adorable, checked in, and sat to wait in the foyer.  \n\nA young woman soon invited me in to an examination room, greeted me, identified herself as a vet and proceeded to glomp (uh - examine) my pupper.  As it was just a checkup to be sure she was healthy and hadn’t been injured on the flight, the whole thing took less than ten minutes - with an additional five minutes for the vet to soak in some puppy cuddles - before I was on my way out with a clean bill of health for my brand new fur baby.\n\nI had literally just stepped out of the first examination room when the door directly opposite opened and an older gentleman stepped out.  He looked at me and said my name.\n\nGentleman Vet: Fudgey?  With [puppy]?\nMe: Yes?\nGentleman Vet: [gestures into his examination room] You can come right on through.  It’s nice to meet you.\nMe: What?  But I’ve already been seen.\n\nThe shock on the gentleman’s face was visible, and as one we both turned to look at the lady vet who had seen me.  She let out a laugh that is instantly recognisable to anyone who has had siblings - a legit “mwah-hah-hah-hah-ha!” - and shut herself back in her room.  I looked back at the gentleman. \n\nMe: Did she steal my appointment from you?\nGentleman Vet: [downcast] Yes...\n\nI have never before seen a man of that age and dignity so crestfallen.  He looked like a little boy who had just realised Santa didn’t exist.  His coworker had nicked the chance to play with a puppy from him - which seemed to be a sought-after prize.  Now that would not do.  I had a lot of puppy to go around, after all.\n\nMe: Would you like to hold the puppy?  That’s pretty much why you wanted my appointment, right? [I hold out pupper]\nGentleman Vet: [lights up like a Christmas tree] Really?  That would be wonderful!\n\nHe took my puppy and began to coo (actually cooed - dignified older gentleman cooing) over her while she licked his nose.  The vet nurses started to gather and I took a seat until everyone had done the rounds.  My baby loved meeting everyone and gave out kisses like they were going out of style.  She was fed so many treats her little tummy bulged by the time they were done.   It was a solid half hour before I got her back, but totally worth waiting over to see the faces of the nurses and the gentleman vet.  Everyone deserves puppy love! \n\n",

They'd just opened, so they weren't busy at all, but it still seemed to take them a while to get our food. \n\nMy sister and I have both worked food service jobs before. We know how it is, and we don't tend to complain about anything when we go out to eat. In fact, I was telling my sister about the things I was noticing. Our waitress was in charge of a fairly large section of the restaurant, plus the bar, plus the car side pickup. Despite this, our waitress was incredibly attentive.\n\nAt one point, near the end of the meal, I see our waitress's boss telling her something that seemed to make her upset. I heard her say, \"So what do I do?\" and the boss just shrugged and said \"We'll take care of it.\"\n\nApparently, their entire computer system went down, and they had no way of tallying up our meal, printing our receipts, etc. So our meal was free. My sister and I had already discussed leaving the waitress a higher than average tip for her hard work and the seemingly stressful environment that was going on that day. At this news, we were both a little shocked, and I was like, \"Oh, well, can we still give you a tip?\"\n\nShe seemed surprised by this, but said that if we wanted to, we could. My sister, who had offered to pay for the whole meal anyway, pulled out a $20 and was like, \"This is what I have.\" The waitress just kind of stared at her and was like, \"Do you want me to go make change?\" and we were like, \"No, we just got a free meal. You've been working hard. That's yours.\"\n\nI hope other customers left tips as well, because seriously- she was one of the best waitresses we've had in a while. And her makeup was on point and flawless too. ",

Many times we've ordered and they've taken 2 hours to deliver cold pizza to our place. Another time, they delivered to the wrong apartment and we waited 3 hours for pizza. \n\nAnyway, I complained online and got 2 free pizza coupons. It took weeks for them to send them because they kept writing the address down wrong. We finally get the coupons and go to the store to use them. Our order is simple, large cheese and a large pepperoni. We are told it will be 15 minutes. Awesome! 15 minutes pass, and I ask for my pizzas. They ignore me and go make more pizzas. \n\nMeanwhile, these guys waiting for 5 pizzas go out to their truck, bring in cans of beer, and start drinking (which is illegal in my state). Employees see this and do nothing. \n\nI keep asking for my pizzas, and keep getting ignored. At this point, I have been standing and asking for my pizzas for an hour. \n\nFinally, I walk behind the counter and start asking loudly, \"Can I PLEASE have my two pizzas?!\" Finally someone opens up the to go pizza holder and hands me my two pizzas, rolling her eyes.\n\nThey were not that warm, either.\n\n\nNever going to that location again.",

        "text": "A few months back my partner and I needed to make a journey to her parents. Neither of us can drive for medical reasons and so we are reliant on the train because buses only run every so often through our village to the place we need to go.\n\nWe had a look online and notice that the trains aren’t running due to engineering work but they have arranged for a replacement bus service. We get to the station and buy our train ticket as normal and stand waiting for the bus outside the station where the sign says ‘Bus replacement from here’. The time the bus is due to arrive comes and goes and we stand waiting for a little longer in case it is delayed. Eventually I decided we should call the train company.\n\n‘It snowed last night and the roads are so bad that we can’t run any buses, so we’ve cancelled them’ was their response. Granted, it had snowed the night before but was so light that there was absolutely no remaining snow in sight and the roads weren’t even icy. I told them that the site hadn’t been updated and they told me they hadn’t got round to it yet. Not acceptable, as I’d paid for my ticket already but ok, I’ll claim my money back.\n\nWe head home, I put through my request for a refund and put in all of the scheduled times and reason for cancellation as normal. My partner does the same and we both submit a photo of our tickets for proof as the site requests.\n\nTwo days later and I have an approved refund but she has hers declined. I double and triple check the details we put in and they are exactly the same as the ones I put in. Their excuse? ‘The journey you claimed for was not delayed for more than 15 minutes and therefore doesn’t qualify for any refund’.\n\nWe call them, tell them that the request has been declined but mine was accepted so how can they give one person a refund and not the other? If the journey wasn’t delayed, you wouldn’t have given me my full refund and it ended up with no journey at all, so it was definitely more than 15 minutes. The advisor on the other end of the line tells us that it was declined because it was made clear that there was no service and so we should not have bought a ticket. I explained that the original advisor had told me they hadn’t updated the site by the time we’d bought our ticket so we weren’t to know but no, this new advisor is adamant it is our fault. \n\nI arrange to send him a screenshot of the page that I happened to have because I am so used to being screwed over by this train company. It clearly says that there is a bus service running and the time at the top of the screen is about 10 minutes after the bus was due, so it definitely hadn’t been updated before the ticket purchase. My partner gets an email response telling us they would not be issuing a refund as there wasn’t a delay of more than 15 minutes.\n\nSo we go back and forth over the next week or so, speaking with various managers and telling them that by giving me a refund, they are acknowledging fault and so have to refund my partner for the same issue. They tell us they will investigate but it will take up to 21 days. Great. I the mean time, we get an email from a manager saying they admit fault because they didn’t run the bus service advertised online and will send a letter to us to that effect.\n\nThe entire 21 days after the investigation began, we get a letter telling us we wouldn’t get a refund because of no delay. Back on the phone we go, to be told that there were never any buses planned. We tell them we had an email from a manager saying that the company admits fault and buses were arranged. After a long argument, they tell me they’ll accept the claim as a goodwill gesture. Whilst I’m happy to be getting the money back, I remind him that this isn’t a goodwill gesture - you’ve attempted to keep money for a wrongly advertised service and I’d be taking it further once we have our money back.\n\n5 days later, a letter comes saying that a refund can’t be issued as too much time has passed but here is a voucher in my partners name for the cost of the journey, to be used on the train service. \n\nShe’s now on maternity leave and won’t have a need for the voucher for 9 months. They are invalid after 6 months.\n\nWaiting on a response from corporate now!\n\nTL:dr - train company advertised a service. Didn’t run, tried to say they never advertised it but I had proof. Still denied it, until a manager fessed up to their mistake. Even then, still tried to deny it and refused a refund. Eventually, they agreed to a refund but took so long that they couldn’t process it so sent vouchers that can only be used by my partner and within 6 months. She has no need to use the train for 9 months because she is off on maternity leave.",

        "text": "I was reminded of this story by another post in this thread, made a comment there but figured I would make a post in more detail. \n\nYears ago, as an almost-broke student with a toddler, I frequently ordered from the local pizza chain to save myself some time that could then be spent either doing homework or with my kid. Sometimes lunch, other times dinner. \n\nLunch was never a problem, but when I would order later in the day for dinner there would always be a charge to my card for $10 more than what I had signed for. \n\nI feel it is important to note that nothing else was really ever wrong with my order, in respect to the food itself. \n\nSo, each time that this overcharge happened, I would go in, explain the situation, and the day manager would always just refund my entire purchase in cash, including the $10 overcharge. Ok, that's cool. The charge stayed on my card, but I got the full amount back. I like to believe that it helped my case that, each time, I approached the situation calmly and only asked for the $10 back. \n\nBut cool, free food. \n\nA few weeks later, I sat down with the GM of the location, at my request, because this has now happened 4 times. Basically just wanted to be sure that he was aware that a pattern had formed, and if it is happening to me it is happening to others who may or may not notice, and who almost definitely will not be as patient as I have been. \n\nI get a call about a week later. GM did some research and some surveillance (including a dummy purchase under a fake name with a prepaid card) and had found the culprit. \n\nThe evening shift lead was adding a \"1\" in front of the tip amount, on *every credit reciept*. She would then pocket the surplus. Hundreds of dollars per week. How in the world more people didn't complain, I will never know. I wish I had the cash to not worry about 10 bucks. \n\nHow did he know that it was on every receipt? She didn't even put the effort in to use the same color ink. She carried a purple pen, for her own use when taking orders and stuff. So, the 1 was in purple on every receipt. Rookie mistake, LOL. \n\nShe was fired, and escorted out by the police when she went ballistic. The boss man wasn't going to follow up with any charges, but the local PD strongly encouraged him to.\n\nI don't know if she was ever charged, but that location is closed now. I miss their pizza. ",

        "text": "A couple weeks ago I ordered a couple pizzas online from a popular pizza franchise, one for me and one for my parents. Didn't see the option to cut it into squares online, so I called the store as soon as I placed the order to get it changed. The man said it would be no problem and my carryout would be ready in 15 or 20 minutes. Online, I selected that I wanted to pay with cash, but I actually wanted to pay half cash half card. The cashier told me I couldn't do that and because I selected cash online, that is what I have to pay with. I don't keep much cash on me because I always lose it, which it why I wanted to pay half cash half card, so I could get rid of the cash I currently had. I had to go rummage through my car for the other half and came back. She gives the pizzas to me and I open the box just to check for accuracy, and both pizzas are cut in triangles. I informed her that I wanted one of them cut in squares, and she says \"well that's not a guarantee when we're busy\" and didn't offer to remake it or anything. I say whatever and leave. I get home and write a complaint online because I thought it was completely unprofessional. A couple weeks later, corporate sends me 2 free pizza coupons in the mail. This isn't the first time I've had to complain about this restaurant, so I've gotten these coupons before and I know how they work. I call them and tell them what I want and they say \"I can't do that for you but I can give you a one-topping pizza with regular crust\" I tell her that's not how it works, that they're from corporate, and it says ANY free pizza. She insists on the deal. I explain the whole story to her, and she says \"well why are you trying to get that kind of pizza when you got the coupons on a messed up order for thin crust\" I tell her because they're my coupons and it again says ANY pizza. She still tells me she can only do one topping, regular crust. I'm not having it, I've used these coupons before and ordered this exact order that I'm trying to place now. I hang up and call corporate, wait for 15 minutes, then explain the rundown to this lady on the phone. She tells me that indeed, I'm in the right, these coupons are good up to three toppings, any crust. I stay on the line with her and call the pizza place back on another phone and tell them what's up. She says \"I'm just going off of what my GM told me, I can't do that for you.\" I tell her I'm on the phone with corporate, and that corporate's policy trumps her store policy. I tell her to let me talk to her GM. He isn't there. \"I can text him, if you'd like.\" So I wait. She comes back 5 minutes later and says deal. I tell her I want it cut in squares. She again says it's not a guarantee when we're busy. I tell her I want it cut in squares, and if it's not cut in squares, I'm going to make them remake it when I get there. Low and behold, when I get there, it was cut in squares. She says they aren't allowed remake pizzas due to cutting errors or to take coupons like that because they make them lose money. Well maybe if you didn't mess it up in the first place you wouldn't have such a big issue.\ntldr: popular pizza chain under really bad management refuses to take my free coupon for pizza that came from corporate themselves. \nalso: on mobile, sorry if formatting is ugly.",

Well, he'll head back to the store and bring it to me. Sure, it sucks that he's going to waste his time, but accuracy is a major part of delivery.\n\nHere's where things go downhill quickly. He hands me all of the receipts, and turns back to his car, saying \"I'll be back with your drink\". Okay. There was a tacit understanding on my part that he'd collect the signed and tipped receipt upon return.\n\nHe never comes back. In fact, the manager sent her son to bring me the drink, about an hour later.\n\nWell, the total for the entire order was $18.73 - including delivery fee and tax. Today, I'm checking my statements, and notice that I was charged $23.73, a $5 difference. \n\nI have both the customer and merchant copies of the receipt. The delivery guy never returned for a signed copy. He fraudulently gave himself a rather generous tip. \n\nNaturally, I got pretty angry about this obvious breach of trust between customer and business (well, also a criminal action - La. RS 14:67.3), but my interaction with the manager today made it slightly worse. \n\nShe says \"stop by and I'll give you the $5 cash\", and upon my disapproval of the solution, informs me that the GM is busy and can't take my call - for the entire day, for some reason. \n\n$5 isn't a big deal, but this entire exchange has been bungled over and over again.",

This isn't really a nightmare story, more of a funny and peculiar one. \n\nBackstory: in Indonesia we use denominations of Rupiah (IDR) in 2k (as in 2000), 10k, 20k, 50k, and 100k as paper notes. Coins come in 100, 200, 500, and 1k. To give you a rough idea 1 USD is roughly 14k IDR. For some reason people here hate giving back change in coins, so workers would usually ask the customer to give them extra on top of what they had given the worker so they could round up the change to a 2k note. \n\nI had bought two drinks at a tea shop which amounted to 47k. I gave the guy 50k, and he asked me if I had an extra 2k so he could give me back a 5k note, instead of a 2k note and 1k coin. Fair enough, but I didn't have 2k so I told him no. \n\nAt this time, my bf luckily showed up and rummaged through his pockets for 2k. A minute later, bf found 2k, gave it to him, and the worker gave us back 5k. Instead of him giving us a 5k note like we expected, he gave us the change as two 2k notes and one 1k coin.\n\nMy bf and I laughed. Why in the world would he ask us for a 2k note when he was just going to give it back to us???",

We’re always getting odds and ends there, and on this occasion it was a week day after work and we needed painting supplies and a copy of our house key. It was six thirty and we had half an hour until this store closed.\n\nWe joined the line at the service counter where you have to go to get keys cut. The employee on the door was trying to get us to go to another register, and I realised why.\n\nThere were about five people in line and the woman on the counter was well... she reminded me of that character, Roz, from Monsters Inc. She was grouchy and slow. No worries. It’s pretty late and she’s probably close to retiring. I’d hate to be working customer service at sixty years.\n\nNow, there were a few other registers open and it was irritating, because the people in front and behind us had odds and ends that could be purchased anywhere and yet they were at the special counter slowing us down. And they weren’t listening to old mate on the door either. By the time we were served we had twenty minutes and four people behind us. My SO said, “we’ll have these, please, and a key cut. Thanks.” And ‘Roz’ just stopped. And stared.\n\n“We have twenty minutes to close. It’ll take me fifteen minutes to cut these. And there are customers. So...” and she just held out her hand for the money, already looking past us. Urgh. We wanted to point out that a key getting cut only takes like five minutes (maximum, we’ve had it done there) and that the customers behind us very easily could be served by any of the three staff members currently tasked with serving. But we just left because of her tone and look.\n\nShe looked and sounded like my “favourite” retail employee: the one who can’t be bothered doing their job. It really gets my goat, because I work retail and run myself ragged because I’m grateful to have work. We weren’t asking her to move mountains! *Shakes head*",

This contracted company ruined our walls, damaged the washer and dryer (visible scuffs all over, latch was smashed into the unit, etc). I went to the store to request that they fix it. They sent someone to fix the latch but told me it was my responsibility to get my walls fixed (or get the 3rd party to pay for fixes). I ate the damage and just took care of it myself.\n\nSince then, the washer has been shaking progressively worse to the point that I fear it will damage the mounting bracket, the appliances, or kick the dryer off the washer and cause damage to my home.\n\nI went to the store with video evidence, and they told me the would reach out to a local appliance repair center. The tech determined that the dryer would need to be removed from the washer for diagnostics. This is a multi\\-person job, and they would have to charge for the service. CompanyName said they would not pay for the service, so they told me I need to contact WasherBrand for the repair. I have dealt with appliance repair with large companies, and I am still trying to get a refrigerator repaired (broken since March). I don’t want to call WasherBrand to get a service when I bought a 5 year agreement with CompanyName .\n\nI called CompanyName elite member phone line, and the person on the phone sounded shocked with what I was told so far. They agreed to get someone out ASAP, and placed me on a brief hold. Then, they came back on the line and told me that I live in an area that isn’t covered by CompanyName\\_RepairServices, so I would need to contact WasherBrand. I requested a refund for the CompanyName\\_RepairServices service for the year that WasherBrand would have to service my machine, but they said it was all or nothing, and no credits would be issued. I remained polite and asked what my options are, and they restated the policy that it is up to me to work it out with WasherBrand.\n\nI said I wanted to return the product, but I am now outside the return window. I am furious that I purchased a service agreement that isn’t being honored, stuck with a broken washer/dryer, and nobody will support me unless I call the manufacturer. I cannot wait a month\\+ to get this diagnosed, and months to get it fixed. I work 45 minutes away from where I live, so scheduling repair is a nightmare. Where can I turn for help? Would I stand a chance in small claims?\n\nHopefully this post was anonymized enough :)",

I had been on a 24h party cruise (fun times) and was starving, sleep-deprived and super cranky. So I walk in to the local pizza place to get some food. \n\nShuffling back and forth with what to order I finally decided on a pizza and ask for it with EXTRA LOVE. The dude looked at me like I was crazy (im sure I looked the part) so I told him \"I'm starving so gimme it with extra good stuff. I'll pay extra of course, just make it full of goodness and love\" \n\nI pay. Get the pizza to go and get home . That's when I notice that the dude wrote \"kebab pizza with extra love &lt;3\" on it. \n\nSuch a sweet detail that was completely unexpected and the pizza was tasty as hell! \n\n\n\n\n\n",

My hamburger coming out basically still mooing and a long wait time for food. But this dinner is so close to work that I decided to give it a third chance today. I was hungry and tired after caring for 9 2-year-olds all morning. So the food was great but when I gave the waitress my check it was taking longer then normal to get it back. I asked her where my debit card was and why it was taking so long. She responded, “oh it’s up front I’ll bring it back to you.” So I waited. And waited. And waited. It’s been about 15 minutes since i have her my card. She has not only cleared my table but has wiped it down while I’m sitting there. I decide enough is enough so I go up front to see what’s going on. Apparently their credit card machine was down and instead of telling me this information they decided to just make me wait with no intention of communicating to me the issue. Now, if this was just a technical issue, fine. But now I’ve been waiting for so much longer then I needed to be. Now I’ve moved up to the front and the manager is cursing at the waitress for some other reason and it took me 45 minutes to pay the $13 check. ",

Now, most of you probably know, when you live in the suburbs, shaded parking spots at your average shopping center are at a premium since almost all vegetation was cut down and parking decks are too expensive to build. But, lo and behold, I spotted what I thought was a shaded parking spot!\n\nMy hopes were dashed, though, when I saw an empty flatbed trailer parked in the spot. Honestly, I figure only the store would be able to get away with leaving an empty trailer in that spot for days on end. But why there? *There?!? In one of the only shaded spots in acres upon acres of parking?!?!?*",

        "text": "Saw some other medical stories so hope this allowed. \n\nAlso I am not looking for a debate. This was 13 years ago, I was an adult, I am completely comfortable and secure in my choice, am the mother to a fantastic 7 year old boy, and am still very pro choice. Now that the disclaimer is out of the way. \n\nWhen I was 19 my birth control failed and I got pregnant. Due to a whole host of reasons I knew I was not ready to be a parent nor did I want to be yet. Deciding to get an abortion was the option in my mind so I called my OBGYN for a referral. \n\nI know now that this doctor (Dr. Ass or DA from now  on) is not only well known in my state for being one of the first to perform abortions but is well known in the medical community for being a complete and total ass to his patients. At the time I had no idea and was completely unprepared for what was about to happen. \n\nI arrive the day of the procedure with my mom and after signing forms I’m taken back to an examine room to have an ultrasound and pelvic exam. Due to a medical condition pelvic exams have always been painful for me and I usually cry a bit. So after the uneventful ultrasound I warn DA that I might cry during the exam, that it’s normal for me, pain etc. \n\nLo and behold I start crying and DA comes up to my head and hits me three times rapidly on the shoulder and tells me to “stop that right now young lady!”\n\nIt was here that I noped out. There was no way I was letting this man perform an intimate procedure on me. \n\nAfter the exam I asked the nurse if she could bring my mom back and I could talk with both of them. When I relayed the incident my mom looked ready to go nuclear and the nurse had that resigned look of someone who is 0% surprised about something. This was apparently typical for Dr. Ass. I said I wanted to leave and the nurse understood. \n\nBefore I could sign the required paperwork Dr. Ass came into the room and had the gall to tell me that I clearly hadn’t thought my decision through due to my “hysterics.” My mom, ever the second wave feminist she is, started on a tirade about trusting women and I had to drag her out of there. \n\nTwo weeks later I had the procedure done at planned parenthood for half the price, with a kind doctor, and discovered Dr. Ass hadn’t even read the ultrasound correctly. He claimed I was 7-8 weeks when in reality it was closer to 10-11 so by the time I got to PP I was past the pill option and only had the much more lengthy surgical option available.\n\nSince then I have supported numerous friends through abortions for one reason or another and I’ve done my best to praise PP and bad mouth Dr Ass every time. I’ll never report him because abortion providers are scarce in this country and very much needed, but seriously... F that guy.",

The manager is trying to sort this out while the cashier continues to take customers and argue with Pump 4 and Pump 6 man that nothing is wrong here and they're freaking out over nothing.\n\nIt's sorted nearly 15 minutes later as the manager finally gets Pump 6 man to understand what happened and that he'll open up the pump for another $10, he's already pumped $10 so they don't owe him $20, they owe him $10, she put Pump 4's gas on the wrong pump. He storms out after demanding the district manager's name and phone number.

Pump 6 guy was really upset and screaming about it but it's all a big misunderstanding.\n\nPump 4 guy: Yeah that you caused! Even if it's a mistake, the least you can do is apologize for wasting 15 minutes of everyone's time. *leaves*\n\nShe did not take kindly to this and ranted at me, the poor guy standing there working that this was bullshit, all a misunderstanding and not at all her fault. We're forbidden from getting involved in things like this but I couldn't believe how she reacted to a situation that was entirely her creation. On top of that, she continued to argue with both pump guys while ignoring people trying to buy cigarettes and other behind the counter things and even once the manager fixed the thing that she screwed up in the first place she couldn't even apologize or give a \"my bad\" non-apology. \n\nI'm not due back for a little while but something tells me that I won't be seeing her there when I do.",

        "text": "A recent conversation with my sister reminded me of this event and I feel I should share it with you good people. There’s a bit of backstory so please bear with me.\n\nI’m not sure how it is in other places, but here in the UK there are manual car washes located in the car parks of our larger supermarkets. You park up by the car wash bays, give them your keys and go do your shopping while they wash it. Then, when you come out with your shopping, you pay the car wash guys and drive away in your sparkling clean motor. \n\nUnfortunately, when my sister and I (decidedly not male, which is important later) visited the local supermarket, that isn’t quite how it went down. \n\nSister drove us in her fully refurbished, mk1 1.8 Eunos Roadster. People here call it a “hairdresser’s car” but it was her pride and joy. Immaculate condition and great fun to drive. We dropped the car at the car wash (so no need to move it more than two spaces), handed over the keys and went to shop. \n\nWe’re both bosses when it comes to food shopping so we were sorted and out the door in no time. I guess the car wash guys didn’t count on this as when we stepped out into the car park, we see two of them in Sister’s car, absolutely ragging it down the length of the car park. Low gear, high revs and an awful ‘scrunch’ sound as they went over the speed bump before parking up back at one of the car wash bays. \n\nUnfortunately, my sister is not one for confrontation and didn’t want to cause a scene so when we got to the car wash, she paid them and we left. When we got home, we realised that, to add insult to injury,  they had missed a lot of dirt and overall did a terrible job of cleaning the car. \n\nAbout a year later, someone on our town’s Facebook page asked for car wash recommendations. My sister, not thinking much of it, posted an account of the above. A few hours later, she received [this vaguely threatening message. ](https://imgur.com/a/qleu4Fo) which reads:\n\n&gt; Hello (Sister’s name), I’m the person in charge of the car wash in (Supermarket name).. I would appreciate it if you would stop talking bullshit about my business because the stuff you’re saying ain’t true.. I remember u verry well and ur boyfriend and it wasn’t so long ago that iv washed your car.. Ok cool if we didn’t do a great job but talking that shit is unacceptable.. So mind how you talk.. Thanks 😉\n\nSo she screenshot the message and posted it on the town Facebook page in reply to her earlier comment. Sadly, the account the message came from has since been deleted. \n\nAnd that is the story of how “mind how you talk” and “I remember your boyfriend” have become running jokes between us whenever one of us speaks negatively about something. \n\n\n**TL;DR** Car wash owner sends my sister a vaguely threatening message saying he remembers her and her non-existent boyfriend after she writes a negative but fair review of his business.

        "text": "Background-\nWhen I was very young, my family and I used to go to a family owned reataurant in our small town fairly often. My parents both worked 12-16 hours a day running their business and my mom didn't really like to cook so I considered this place to be a source of \"home cooked\" meals. My parents started going there together when they first got married and it was the first restaurant I ever went to at 2 weeks old. We knew the staff well and were friendly with all the waitresses especially. \n\nStory-\nThis takes place on a Sunday at lunch. For those who have never waited tables, the Sunday after church crowd is the absolute worst. When I waited tables years later, I would look at people I had been sitting next to at church less than an hour before and think \"Did we not hear the same message? I remember something about 'love thy neighbor' but maybe you heard it as 'be a huge dick hole to thy waitstaff'.\" \n\nAt this particular restaurant, they had a pretty large dining room (about 15-20 tables) that would only have two (or sometimes one) waitress(es) working in it. On the day of this story, there was only one. She was running around like crazy to try to serve everyone. At one point, a table of 8 or so asked for refills on coffee. She brought the pot over but got called to something else. She set the pot down on the table, apologized, and promised to be right back. One of the men  at the table got up, took the pot, and refilled everyone's cups. I remember thinking how nice that was that he was helping out. I was... very wrong. \n\nThe waitress will be W, asshole guy will be AG, and my dad will be D. \n\nAG- You didn't fill up our coffee. I had to do it myself. \n\nW- I'm sorry. I just got a little tied up. \n\nAG- (yelling now) I could have burned myself or someone else! I shouldn't have to do that! This place is terrible and you're a terrible waitress!\n\nW- (almost in tears) I'm so sorry. Please let me know what I can do to make it up to you. \n\nAG was about to continue yelling, but at that point, my dad slammed his fists on our table causing the whole thing to jump as he stood up. My dad is 6\"2\" and around 220. The whole restaurant was staring now. He pointed right at AG and started in on him. \n\nD- Enough! W is obviously really busy and trying her best to serve everyone here at a busy time. I think she's doing a great job and you need to lay off. \n\nAG- *stutters*\n\nD- I don't want to hear it. You're the one who picked up the coffee and you're the one who started berating W. Now you need to sit down and shut your mouth before I come over and do it for you!\n\nAG was clearly embarrassed. He looked around at his table for help but everyone else there seemed really interested in their shoes or the wall. The owner, who was a friend of ours, came out and told us not to worry about lunch. It was on him that day. My dad left what the meal would have cost as a tip for the waitress. On the way home, he said something I will never forget. \n\nD- Son. I shouldn't have made a scene like that back there. It's not right to lose your temper all the time, but sometimes enough is enough and you have to say something. Never ever let me catch you treating someone who is doing any kind of service for you like that guy was. People that work for us should never be treated like they're less than us. It's so important that we show them gratitude and take care of them like they take care of us. \n\nIn the time I waited tables, no one ever stood up for me like that, but any time I've ever been sitting with someone who is rude to the wait staff or see it happen otherwise, I make it a point to embarrass that person as much as I possibly can. Be kind to your servers, folks. It's just the right thing to do. \n\nTL;DR-\nA real human turd is mean to a waitress who also happened to be a friend of my family's. My dad embarrasses him big time and teaches me a lesson about kindness and humanity in the process. ",

Cute li'l thing, I'd picked up a different one at $BigBoxHardwareStore a year or so ago for a project and wondered whether I ought to pick this up in case I needed a spare.\n\nThen I looked at the specs.  ... ... ............ Wow.\n\nThis wasn't a little under-counter heater for hot water at the sink.  It was a whole-house almost-tankless instant water heater.  Electric, not gas.  It required twenty-four kilowatts of power.\n\nLet me say it again.  **24,000 watts.**\n\nThat's 100 amps at 240 volts.  Digging deeper into the specs it required three separate 240 volt 40 amp circuits for wiring.\n\nNote that, in this city, most houses have 100 amp services.  This device would pull it *all* with nothing left even for lighting.\n\nPeople would be buying this thing, expecting it to be just a regular small electric water heater, and discover it required a whole lot of power.  Many would open the package before they realized the problem.  Plenty would try to wire it in somehow and blow breakers.  All of them would be annoyed and most would try to return it.\n\nI decided to give management a heads-up on the problem, and headed for the customer service desk.  I got hold of a manager, explained the problem, and suggested they at least put a sign up saying the heater required multiple 240 volt connections and needed an electrician for installation.\n\nSo of course I was blown off.

        "text": "I'm not even sure if this applies to this subreddit, I'm new to this, so bear with me please.\n\nSo we're on vacation, and we just had dinner at this Italian place, or at least I think it was supposed to be Italian.   Not important, anywho.   This literally JUST happened, as I began typing this while we were waiting for the SECOND check, and you'll understand why I said second in a....well, second.\n\nSo, on the menu of this restaurant, there is a prefixed menu, you know how some places do, where you get a meal and a dessert, only usually the prices line up so you get some sort of discount, or the items are different on the prefix menu.   Only it's not here, for some reason.   You can get the same two items, an entree and a dessert, for $4.05 less on the a la cart menu than on the prefix menu.   So basically, they can charge you extra just for getting it prefix.   Example prices: 19.95 for given meal, 8.95 for given dessert, regular menu.   32.95 for same two menu items together, prefix menu.\n\nWe end up eating, food was good, but then we get to the heart of the story, the reason why I'm making this confusing post in the first place.   The waitress brings the dessert menu, and we notice things are a bit sketchy when she tries to force the prefix menu desserts on us.   We say we don't want the prefix menu, and just want to order a la cart.   She says it's fine, and we end up ordering our dessert, and she brings it to us.   We eat, and the dessert was equally tasty as the actual meal, so no problems there.\n\nThen we get the check, and find out that they ended up listing our order as the prefix menu, despite our request to order a la cart.   Not only that, but 2 people at the table, who were charged for the prefix menu prices, ordered desserts that were NOT on the prefix menu, yet they got charged the extra $4.05 anyway.   In the end, our bill was $12.15 cents more than normal.   Not a staggering amount, I know, but if they do this to EVERY table that comes into the restaurant, and there were tables far larger than ours, the restaurant could turn quite a nice profit.\n\nWe were fuming when we learned they tried to charge us extra, and after complaining, they apologized for the \"confusion\" and gave us the corrected bill.   I'm not sure if we're out of line for complaining about this, but I feel they should make customers aware that they will charge an extra four bucks without saying so.   Out of principle, I try to avoid causing commotions at restaurants, but this, to me, was inexcusable.   Were we wrong?\n\ntl;dr, restaurant tries to charge us extra for prefix menu, which had same items as the regular menu.   we got mad and complained",

TL:DR at end-if you can think of a better one, go ahead and say.\n\nThis story is from a few hours ago:\n\nEvery week, after the local nerdy sports group I am in plays their games (ends roughly 8:30pm), a trip to a Fast Food joint usually follows after everyone has packed up the gear (lights, foam weapons, chairs etc).\n\nUntil two weeks ago, it was to \"Big -M-\" signed place, but had changed to a \"Burger place\" (not real names) for a change of pace, but after what happened, we may go back to the last place. Anyway, everyone slowly orders, gets their food and sits down at 3 different tables.\n\nAfter everyone had eaten, there was some discussion as to some future events for the group, different gear (massive tent), photo-shoot photos and other topics. We weren't being loud, made sure the rubbish was put away and tried to be respectful, but at 9:30pm a member of staff turned off the lights as if to tell us \"GTFO\" so we did.\n\nThis may not seem like such a major deal, and they were actually closing soon (10pm) so it is understood that they would want everyone out so they can clean, but it was the way they told us to \"get out\" which irked people. Is that really how they should kick people out?\n\nTL:DR-local nerdy sports group changed dinner spot two weeks ago but after having the lights turned off on us 30min before close, we way go back to old spot ",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/8onsk3/a_requested_prequel_to_yesterdays_sandwich_shop/",
        "text": "Previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/8ofz0s/i_made_a_delivery_sandwich_shop_make_and_bring_my/?utm_source=reddit-android\n\nHopefully this story makes me seem like a bit less of a bitch and serves to explain why I truly feel justified in being rude to them yesterday. Having worked in food service before, I'm pretty forgiving... to a point. But as I mentioned in my last post, they get things right maybe four out of five times with me. That's a pretty bad track record. \n\nSo, this one was years ago. Same franchise, same town but a different location. This was so bad I remember like it was yesterday.\n\nSo I'm moving, and since the new place is only ~150ft away from the old one and most of my furniture is light, I hire my neighbors to help with the promise of sandwiches for lunch and beer when we're done. I write down everyone's order, call it in and give them my card number.\n\nThe forecast is calling for 104° that day. None of us have eaten yet so we're starving, but we start moving my things, figuring we will stop for lunch when the sandwiches get there. Shouldn't take long, right? But we want to get things done as early as possible to avoid heatstroke. Also, its another situation in which my bad back has flared up. \n\nIn the misery of us moving my things, we lose track of time and pretty much completely forget about the sandwiches. Some time later, we're done. We're sitting there, resting, feeling like we're dying. And suddenly we all realize it's been way longer than it should have been. I check my phone for how long it's been: two and a half hours! Obviously something's not right.\n\nSo I call the sandwich place and ask where my food is. Explain that I ordered 2.5 hours ago and nothing came. \n\nThey insist my food was delivered. They kind of act like \"so, that's that...\" And hang up. \n\nI'm sweaty, exhausted, starving and looking at a moving party who feels the same, and I have no idea what to say. It's obvious to me the food never came, but I'm being called a liar on the phone. Being the shy girl I was back then, I hang up to try and gather my thoughts. Did one of my guys sign for the food, set it down somewhere and forget or something? Am I hallucinating from the heat? I look at the moving party and explain what I was just told. They all confirm they never saw a delivery driver. \n\nSo I call back and insist my food never came. Tell them I have three guys sitting here with me who can back me up. I get told the same thing. \"The food was delivered a long time ago. And the driver has gone home for the day.\" \n\nI press harder this time. \"Well, it wasn't delivered here. You think the driver has a cell phone? I think my $40 is worth calling them.\"\n\nShe sighs heavily enough that it's clear she's not trying to hide that she's annoyed, takes my number down, says she'll call him and call me back.\n\nTwenty minutes later I haven't been called back. I give it another ten, feeling like maybe she's having to call him multiple times. I'm annoyed but I get it. When you're off the clock, you're off the clock, right?\n\nI call back, get someone different and explain the situation saying I'd like to speak to the girl I was on the phone with before. I get put on hold and left there. I hang up and call back again. I get the girl.\n\nGIRL: \"He said he delivered the food around 12:30. He was paid cash, and then went home for the day saying he wasn't feeling well.\"\n\nME: \"Wait... what? He was paid cash?!\n\nGIRL: \"Yes, cash.\"\n\nME: \"I PAID WITH A CARD.\"\n\nGIRL: \"Ugh... let me look at the order.\n\n...\n\n\"Oh, yeah, you did... Let me call you back.\"\n\nME: \"I want my money back.\"\n\nAgain, I wait 30 minutes thinking they're over there trying to figure out how everything went so wrong. I might have even waited 45 minutes  sitting there wondering how in the world this happened, my moving party and I going back and forth between laughing at the absurdity and being hangry.\n\nI call back again.\n\nGIRL: \"You're going to have to wait until the manager comes in. He'll be here in an hour and a half. And the manager said that since you paid with a card, you have to come down to the store to get your money back.\" \n\nME: \"What? Why? Why do I have to come down to the store to get my money back?\"\n\nClick. She hung up on me.\n\nUnbelievable. Despite there being a major malfunction on their part, that girl clearly doesn't get paid enough for this shit. \n\nSo I'm nearing the end of all the money I had left. I'm a broke college student and the move took everything I had except what was left for sandwiches and beer. I ask one of my neighbors if they'll order some pizza and I'll pay him back later. While they wait for the food to arrive, I go get two cases of beer so we can drink the day away. I owe these guys for real at this point, but I don't want to start drinking and then have to go straighten things out with a sandwich shop manager. I make a sandwich for myself, as I can't eat pizza and ask the guys to leave me some beer for later.\n\nThe time comes, and I head down to the sandwich shop. I'm literally limping and waddling like a pregnant lady in pain from what moving has done to my inflamed herniated disc at this point. \n\nI ask for the manager immediately. I felt like a 26 year old Grandma determined to use my expired coupons at the grocery store walking in there like that, but I'm not telling the story again. All I want is my money, some beer and my bed. Manager comes out. White guy with dreads. Bloodshot eyes. Looks like Cheech and Pauley Shore's love child. I look around and see all of the employees have the same look. I realize every single one of them is stoned as fuck, and start to understand what I'm dealing with.\n\nPlease read the manager's parts sounding like Cheech because that's *exactly* how he spoke.\n\nMANAGER: \"So... here's what I figured out happened, man. Today was the Pride parade and our driver couldn't get past the parade to deliver your food, right?  So, apparently...\" And he's laughing at this point... \"he delivered your food to someone walking down the street. The guy signed your receipt. Didn't even leave the driver a tip, man. Poor guy went home sick.\"\n\nME: \"Dude... the parade was like a mile and a half long. Could he not have found another route to my house?! Or maybe called me to explain the problem?!\"\n\nMANAGER: \"Right on, man, yeah ... kids these days, right? Haha. So. If you'll sign this receipt for your refund, you'll have the money back in your account in a few days.\"\n\nME: \"Well, considering I'm about as broke as one of those kids these days, and you guys got paid both by card AND cash just give me the extra cash in your drawer and we'll call it even.\"\n\nMANAGER: \"What cash...\"\n\nME: \"Girl I spoke to on the phone said dude told her on the phone that the guy who got my food paid in cash. You all got paid double.\"\n\nMANAGER: \"Well, we've counted the drawer for that shift and there was no extra cash. I'm not sure what you're talking about, man.\"\n\nAt this point... I realize what's happened. It sounds exactly like the scam the sister of my best friend in high school use to pull when she wanted some extra money for the weekend. Dude pocketed the cash, and faked feeling bad to go home early, having made his tips for the day. I'm sweaty, tired, in pain, and fully defeated. I left crying from exhaustion, and anger, and scared my neighbor who'd helped me move and paid for the pizza might be mad at me.\n\nHe was. He was sweet and tried to hide it, but he wasn't exactly rolling in cash either. We were all broke college students on that street.\n\nAnd that's the story of how both me and my kind neighbor got fucked over by the delivery driver of a well-known sandwich franchise with an apparent chronic case of the DGAFs who wanted to dip out early and get a free quarter bag, and I spent a week cooking for my neighbor so he didn't have to live on Ramen and peanut butter crackers. \n\nOther notable screw ups from the same company:\n\nDropped my co-worker's order off at my desk because it was the first one he saw, said \"I already got my tip, and since you'd just be showing me to them anyway, byeeee!\" Reeked of really good weed so bad then when my co-worker came to get his food, he asked if I was getting high in my office. He was joking, I think... I hope. \n\nI watched them put tomato slices on my sandwich directly after I had told them I'm allergic. When I reminded him of it from four feet away in an empty, quiet store he first didn't hear me. When I repeated myself, he said \"oh shit,\" pulled them back off and continued to wrap my sandwich like that was fine. It's not fine. So stoned, he couldn't hear me speaking to him in a silent room. Yeah, I've been there, done that. I know how it goes. But never at work, and this is why.\n\nForgot my soda and cookie. Only brought my sandwich. Took over an hour to bring them. The ice in my soda had melted. Also reeked of loud. At least my sandwich was right. ",

        "text": "TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nI’m on my cell so sorry for the formatting.\n\nBackground, I went to a big chain grocery store for some diapers that I forgot to get earlier that day, and I was kinda in a rush since I needed to pick up my child from the sitters.  I only had the big box of diapers so I went through the self checkout lane and I made sure to grab the receipt. I even spoke to the customer service manager that’s always around and adores my child, we had a little chat and I headed for the exit. When I walked out the exit I saw an employee but didn’t think anything about it and went for the trash can on the far side of her to throw away my receipt. As soon as I threw it away, this was the conversation. I will be “me” and she will be inexperienced employee “IE” for short. \n\nIE “ ma’am I need to see your receipt” (snatched my box of diapers out of my hand) \n\nMe “ ma’am you just saw me throw it in the trash” \n\nIE “I wasn’t paying attention, I need to see your receipt or I’m going to take these back.”  (Rolling her eyes while expressing attitude) \n\nME (getting aggravated I grabbed the receipt from the trash, which was not even 2 feet from her) “ Here.” \n\nIE (takes 3 minutes to examine the one item receipt) Okay I just need to match up the numbers on your receipt to your card number”\n\nME “ I’m sorry what? No, I just threw it in the trash, you made me dig it back out and it clearly has the product I purchased on there”\n\nIE “ Well I believe you are trying to steal these so I need to see you’re card now” (in an ugly tone) \n\nNow I was a front end manager for a huge toy store for 3 years so I know customer service and I know you can’t treat a customer like this, especially outside the exit door. Not even inside the store. I was extremely aggravated and was not getting my wallet out in the high traffic area to prove that was my receipt. I also happened to know the customer service manager at this location so I put on my manger face. \n\nME “excuse me? No I don’t have to prove that to you, I don’t have to prove anything to you. You’re cameras will do that for me, the manager even spoke to me after I checked out. (I took the box out of her hands) I suggest you go talk to him and get a lesson on how to communicate with customers, because with the way you spoke to me you won’t last long here. You can’t accuse a customer of anything even if they have done something, you have to prove it first. And since I’m an honest customer you can’t prove it because I paid for it! Have a nice day ma’am!” \n\nI walked away feeling kinda shitty but kinda happy about it, I hate that store, but it’s the only grocery store in our area. \n\nTL;DR\n \nEmployee accused me of theft, I shot back at her with my management knowledge ",

        "text": "Edit:  Putting this at the top, as this was the original post, I crossposted it with more info, so now I'm updating this one with the more info, as well as a few additions for clarity.  \n\nSo some friends of mine make custom leather goods and asked for my help running a booth out of state. Sure! So, they book a suite, 3 beds, 6 adults, and we get... 4 towels.  \n\nNow, hotel towels are tiny, and I use one towel for my hair, so, that usually requires a polite request, but... seriously, we book for 6 adults and get 4 towels? So far, every day has been a fight to get fresh towels, with the front desk staff getting progressively ruder.  We are also completely unable to request a few new towels and reuse our old ones, as both the front desk and housekeeping insisted that we return the used towels before we could obtain new ones.  \n\nAs one of the people asking for two extra towels, I can confirm my conversation went like this.  \nMe:  \"Hi, I'm so sorry to bother you, but we are out of towels and need more towels.\"  \nNA: \"What room are you in?\"  \nMe: *gave him the room number*  \nNA: \"You can only have four towels per room. You have to return the other towels.\"  \n\nI then left, returned the 4 wet towels, and he proceeded to tell me that he had no clean towels so he couldn't give me any towels and I would have to contact housekeeping. I pointed out that it was midnight, we has been working from 9:30am until midnight that day, and several of us wanted to wash off the dirt and sunscreen before we got into bed. He then told me there was nothing he could do and we could wait for housekeeping tomorrow morning.  \n\nMonday morning, our checkout day? The owner of the leather business gathered up last nights towels to trade so she could shower. The front desk guy told the owner that she \"doesn't even pay for her room, her company does, so she needs to quit complaining.\"  \n\n... seriously, dude???  \n\nAfter this, it's time to check out. Obviously, we wanted to contact the manager. So... the business manager decided to take care of it this time and did contact the manager. The manager informed him that we were harassing his associates, that we were rude, and that we were clearly destroying the room.  \n\nThe hotel manager, after informing our manager that our group had been rude, proceeded to contact the police and had them do a drive by as we were packing our things. He also refused to check us out until he inspected the room for damage, so we couldn't leave when we wanted to.  \n\nOur manager called the non-emergency police line and informed them that he was essentially being held hostage, as we were being refused check out by the hotel manager and we couldn't leave the property. The manager then gave him a receipt and we left. About 30 minutes on the highway later, and I looked at the receipt and realized he never actually checked us out, as it showed no check out time, and no name of the person who checked us out.  ",

I like this company's  sandwiches, but I'm positive every single location is purely staffed by stoners. \n\nAs an aside, I have nothing against weed. I love weed. I used to smoke every day and I still would if I weren't looking for a job. But we stoners tend to recognize each other and this sandwich franchise is run by them.\n\nThey make food mistakes like I have never seen... but I agree to it anyway. Four out of five times they get it right. \n\nAnyway, Boyfriend puts our order in online. I get my usually: #14, no tomato (allergic), no mayo (nasty), add cheese and oregano. Not long after, our sandwiches arrive. I open mine... there's mayo all over the place. Both sides of the bread. There's no saving this sandwich. I know I can't eat it.\n\nSo first, Boyfriend calls. He's put on hold and left there. I take the phone so he can eat, see the timer on his phone is at 3.5 minutes of being on hold and pretty much immediately hang up and call right back. I get the manager.\n\nI'm annoyed, but not rude. I explain the situation, give him the order number, he offers store credit and I refuse saying I want a sandwich. He wasn't rude, but he wasn't sorry either. Whatever... I repeat my order and he says they'll get it right out. \n\nNot long after that, the new sandwich is delivered. I open it. \n\nIt's. Wrong. Again. They made a mishmash sandwich from what Boyfriend ordered but with my specifications. Ham (meh), mustard (NO). \n\nAt this point... I'm pretty angry. I just sit and stare at the wall for a minute deciding what to do. I would normally have gotten in my car with both sandwiches and the order receipt and gone to the store to be a jerk but my back has been in bad shape today. I'm not climbing in and out of a car more than absolutely necessary. So I call again.\n\nME: \"Manager. Now.\"\n\nEMPLOYEE: \"Hold on I'll get him.\"\n\n...\n\nMANAGER: \"Hello.\"\n\nME: \"Yeah it's me again. You all screwed up my sandwich again.\" I repeat my order again.\n\nMANAGER: \"Ok, I'll make it myself this time.\"\n\nME: \"Pick someone to make it who isn't stoned.\"\n\nA full ten seconds of silence.\n\nMANAGER: \"I said I'd make it myself.\"\n\nME: \"Uh, huh... well pay attention.\" I repeat my order one more time for those of us in a state of short-term memory loss. \n\nMy sandwich arrives correct this time, although it's a little sad looking. Very light on the sandwich meat. Whatever. I ate it. But considering what else they have put me through, I think I've had enough. I'll probably never risk doing this to myself again. \n\nEdit: An all-emcompassing response to the comments here. I think screwing up an $8 sandwich *twice* warrants some rudeness. Also, I think you guys have seen Waiting too many times. ",

They're always surprisingly busy, even late in the evening, so I was not surprised there was a line.\n\nI was stuck behind another car halfway to the microphone when the person taking orders asked for my order. I was hesitant to try ordering at first, but she kept repeating can I take your order. So I called out.\n\n&gt;I'm not quite to the microphone, can you hear me?\n\n&gt;Yes\n\n&gt;Okay, can I get a large coke with no ice, a small fry and two plain cheeseburgers?\n\nI said it slowly, I used to work fast food and I know better than to order too quickly.\n\n&gt;That was a large coke and what else?\n\nOh, I thought you could hear me.\n\n&gt;Large coke with no ice, a small fry and two plain cheeseburgers.\n\nSo then I sit in the drive thru for another ten minutes waiting to get to the window.\n\n&gt;You had a large coke?\n\nThe lady asks. \n\n&gt;I had a large coke no ice, a small fry and two plain cheeseburgers.\n\n&gt;Okay, yeah\n\nShe says handing me a coke that has ice in it. Whatever, at this point though I had given myself ample time, I need to get moving. I get to work, sit down at the desk and open the bag. There are no grill tickets on the burgers...\n\nAnd naturally the cheeseburgers are not plain. Luckily they only have ketchup and mustard on them though, they left off the pickles and onions which are my main issue with the burger toppings. I usually just order plain because I don't like the mess.\n\nBut seriously. You said you heard me. I repeated my order three times. I literally asked you to do fewer steps. LESS WORK. ",

Afterwards, around 1 a.m., I was wandering back to my accommodation when I saw a 24-hour shop.\n\nI was a bit hungry so went inside to see what they had. I noticed straight away that the security guard was looking at me, but I put it down to me being some decades older than the other customers who looked like students.\n\nI wandered round the shop, with the security guard still watching me, and decided on a packet of biscuits. I went up to counter, paid for  it and left.\n\nWalking up the street, I heard someone saying \"Excuse me! Excuse me!\", and I turned round to see the security guard right behind me. He said \"Did you pay for that\"?, and I said \"Yes\". Then he said \"Would you like to come back to the shop? I don't think you paid for that.\"\n\nI was tempted to just say \"I did pay for it, goodbye\" and to turn round and keep walking. I felt he almost certainly didn't have any right to pursue me but I wasn't completely sure, so I decided to go back to the shop with him. Also, I was finding the situation so bizarre I was perversely curious to see what might happen.\n\nBack at the shop counter I remembered which shop assistant I'd bought the biscuits from, so I asked \"Did I buy this from you about five minutes ago?\", and he said \"Yes\", looking at me, the biscuits and the security guard. The security guard said \"Oh, okay then\", and that was that. ",

        "text": "A few days before christmas I met up with a couple of old school friends for a night out. As we left school 30 years ago, there was plenty of catching up and reminiscing to be done. So we started early.\n\nWe visited several fine public house establishments before deciding to be somewhat sensible and eat some food. We walked to a well known and reputable basement bar which serves fairly good mexican food and tapas. By this time everywhere in the city is crowded, but we managed to snag some bar stools at a high table / counter. We ordered some truly excellent Margaritas, some sharing dishes and after our food arrived we became engrossed again in conversation.\n\nI was sitting with my back to the rest of the bar, so the first sign of trouble I saw was writ large on my friends face. Then in a feat of gazelle like elegance, she lept over the top of the table to the other side. I turned to see what could have prompted such behaviour on her part, and realised a full scale, 10 person brawl had broken out at the tables next to us.\n\nOur food was half eaten, but in that moment we looked at each other and wordlessly agreed that the usual customer service for payment contract had been well and truly broken. This was an unordered side of fisticuffs. First and only time I have done a runner without paying the bill.\n\nI think it was justified.....\n\nEdit:  Perhaps I should have mentioned that the other old school friend we were with, messaged us to say that he popped back and sorted it the next day out as he knew the bar staff.

It was amazing but got out late so we decided to grab \"fast food.\" We make our order at the drive thru at about midnight, fries, two bacon, one sausage breakfast sandwiches. They ask us to wait, which is normal, the sausage usually takes a bit longer so we expected it. However, we were waiting over 20 minutes for our food. \n\nWe got it, I checked the bag to make sure we had everything and we started back home. \n\nThis chain is known for bad but salty fries. For some reason there was no salt on the fries and they were pretty awful. It happens, it's too bad but whatever.\n\nWe get home about 15 minutes later, and go to eat our sandwiches, my SO has the two bacon, I had the single sausage.\n\nI open it up, and...there's no sausage. It's just egg and cheese on a biscuit. Now, I love this sausage, I'll order it by itself sometimes if I don't want the whole sandwich. I bought this sandwich for the sausage, and it was the only thing I was going to eat for dinner that night so I insisted we go back and fix it.\n\nThey're supposed to be closed, but my SO decided to try walking in anyways, turns out their locks are broken on the door, which sucks for them. It takes them maybe 5 minutes to fix the order and I got to finally eat my sandwich like nearly an hour after ordering it.\n\nI ate the egg one first. It was blander than the saltless fries xD",

        "text": "I was reminded of this story after reading a recent post concerning frustrating delivery experiences with large freight companies. I decided not to hijack their post and create my own instead:\n\nI had a new phone coming that I knew I had to sign for, and of course it gets delivered the second I step in the shower after spending 3+ hours outside doing yard work. \n\nI look at the door tag and see that it states I can pick up the phone from their distribution center after 7pm that same day. The center was over 30 the away, but I desperately needed the phone, so I decided to drive out there. \n\nUpon arrival, I have the employee scanned the door tag and told me that the phone had already been delivered. I stared at her with what I'm sure was a dumb look. \n\n\"How is that possible if I wasn't home to sign it, and if I have this door tag that indicates the exact opposite of that?\" I asked. \n\n\"Ummmm it states here that (my sister's name, who was staying for the weekend) signed for it at 645 pm.\"\n\nI accept this information, but was still upset. \"Is it typical of your drivers to make second attempts at deliveries within the same day? Even after leaving tags indicating no such efforts will be made?\" \n\nShe tells me she isn't sure and I realize that she isn't the one I need to be talking to. I decide to return home, another 30 minute drive, and call corporate on my way home to get some clarification. \n\nBasically, the customer service representative told me that drivers sometimes do it, sometimes they don't, but there exists no corporate policy against it. She apologizes for my inconvenience and offers to send my complaint down to the manager of my local distribution center. I determine that it's not worth it at this point. \n\nI understand that in theory, what the driver did was actually really nice. And I can appreciate that. Unfortunately, it cost me a significant amount of time, gas, and frustration because this effort wasn't expected. I know this is a super \"first world problem\", but I feel like if they implemented a blanket policy regarding this action (which probably exists for all I know) then I would've at least been able to act accordingly.

        "text": "Long story short....\n\nI ordered a $2000 pc  that requires a signature. I was home Thursday, the first day of delivery. I saw a truck pull up about 5pm in front of the building before mine. I went outside and watched it pull up to the building after mine and drive off. Right after, got an email that a delivery was attempted at 5:15. Nope. Called, they transferred me from one agent to another and finally spoke to a manager who promised he would call me back. He did not. Fine. Friday I was also home and called around 5 to check up, afraid it would happen again and was told the driver was here at 11:30!  No way!!! Another hour on the phone and another manager said he would make sure the package would get to me by the end of the evening and he would call back. Neither happened. Come Saturday, stayed home all day waiting and the same thing happened! Unbelievable. Not even a door tag left any of these days. \n\nI have spent close to 4 hours total on the phone with customer service. I feel as if they don't believe what I say, or just don't care, even though their driver lied about coming here three times.  I was even transferred to a local person and this guy would not transfer me to a manager and hung up on me. Actually, the second person to hang up on me during this whole ordeal. I have not been difficult or angry on the phone, and feel that they should try to accommodate me at this point and they have not at all. I was told multiple times that I can pick up the package myself at the customer service center 15 miles away, and I even explained that I use a wheelchair and only take public transportation. It is really not possible for me to do. And still, nobody tried to help. \n\nNow its rescheduled for delivery on Monday. Great, I'll be at work. I'm not sure what to do at this point but I don't want to let this go. Can they really get away with this?  Nobody will help. What can I do?",

If it is, I'll head over to the customer service booth.\" She looked relieved and nodded.\n\nWe pay and head over to the toy wall and in the spot of the Kitchen Creations it did say 9.99 but underneath it, it said \"Play-doh Minions\".
