I work as a taxi driver and will be leaving school this year to pursue other interests.  On Monday my parents found out I was an atheist.  I mean, it's not like I did a terribly good job of hiding it: I was already engaged in philosophical and moral debates which my father when I was a Christian, and when I realized I could either be Christian and adopt views I don't believe in or atheist and keep the ones I do, I abandoned religion entirely.  The debates/discussions continued and came to a head on Monday, when my dad basically flat out asked me if I was an atheist.  His tone suggested a lack of anger, so I admitted to him that, yes I am an atheist.  That night he told my mother, and of course tears were shed (as mothers tend to do) but they both wanted to make sure that even though we disagree, they still love me and care for me and will be praying for me (Which I appreciate. It shows they care).  So, yeah.  Everything went better than expected.\n\nHere comes the kicker: My dad wants to know why.  He says he doesn't understand the atheistic point of view.  \"If everything is can be simplified down to an equation,\" he posits, \"there must be an intelligent designer there to make it so.\"  I couldn't come back to it.  I've seen all the evidence on my own, but can't remember sources... not that they'd do much good:  Later we were discussing government defense spending.  He said there's no way we spend more on defense than China.  I said the U.S. spends more than the next 20 countries combined and directed him to [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures) source, which is researched by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.  He said those numbers are fraudulent, because there's no way to actually determine China or Russia's real budget.  I told him that if he was going to simply disregard research because he doesn't believe the answers, there's no way we would ever have a meaningful discussion.  He just dropped it.\n\nSo there's that, but I have to at least try.  I recommended he look at Cosmos with NDT and the Skeptic's Annotated Bible (as a sort of intro), but I need to know where to go from here.  Any sort of research that straight-up proves the things in the Bible didn't happen would be best.  I have to leave as little open to interpretation as possible.  Thank you for letting me share.",

        "text": "My interest in the question of whether or not Jesus was originally a fictional character was spawned by reading the [Jesus Puzzle website](http://jesuspuzzle.humanists.net/home.htm) (I'm sure that you have heard about it before). I always considered the question to be kind of irrelevant. After all what does it matter if there was some radical rabbi running around in Israel around 30 c.e. who happened to gather a great following and become the inspiration for the stories in the bible? (In fact, we know that there were several people claiming to be the messiah at that time period). There's also the issue of what you mean by mythical Jesus. Is it enough if he simply isn't very much like what the bible describes? What if the Jesus of the bible is really an amalgamation of several figures that existed in Israel at that time?\n\nThe website made (in my opinion) a pretty good case that the early Christians believed in an entirely mythical Jesus. However, it didn't really convince me that Jesus wasn't in some fashion a historical person. Only that it's not entirely implausible that he wasn't. After all, the consensus in the field remains that he probably existed in some shape or form as an actual historical person. And Earl Doherty isn't an expert on Bible study.\n\nBut I recently watched a [presentation by Richard Carrier](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HMyudP5z2Xw), a bible scholar who was apparently convinced by Doherty's arguments to study the question seriously and eventually came to the conclusion that in fact a mythical Jesus is the best explanation for the origins of Christianity. So my question(s) is; what do you think about Richards argument? How do you think that it would affect the Christian faith if this were to become the accepted consensus view among secular bible scholars? Obviously the more literalist Churches wouldn't really care what academia had to say about the issue (I would assume). But more academic branches, such as Catholicism, might have to come up with a more intellectual response.\n\nHow would it affect more (radically) liberal Churches, such as the Church of Sweden who's archbishop once said that you don't even have to believe in God to be a member of the Church and that he personally didn't believe in the miracles of Jesus Christ?\n\nHow would it affect ordinary Christians (as opposed to professional Christians such as nuns, priest, monks, and theologians) world wide?\n\n Do you believe that the bible stories were originally inspired by a living historical person or do you think that Richard's theory is more plausible?\n\nIf you watch [Richards presentation](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HMyudP5z2Xw) (I recommend it) it starts 24 minutes into the video.\n\nEdit: some formatting \n\nEdit2: [another good talk on the same topic by the same person](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mwUZOZN-9dc)\n\nEdit3: actually the video in the second edit is pretty much the same as the first one. I remembered it as being more different.",

        "text": "155 years ago today, Charles Darwin published \"On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection,\" a book that has generated more controversy and propelled a larger shift in the zeitgeist of the world than almost any other secular work.\n\nFor those that haven't read it, haven't seen Darwin's thoughts in their original form back when this was the cutting edge of science rather than taken for granted, it's hard to appreciate just how important this book was. Ironically enough, atheists and agnostics especially underestimate the importance of it, thinking it simply the root of evolution. Most don't realize that if it hadn't been written, they may not be irreligious at all.\n\nBecause skepticism doesn't come easy to people, and our brains are pattern-matching machines. Before Darwin, the vast majority of the irreligious were, at the very least, deistic or spiritualists. Great thinkers, rationalists, and philosophers may have recognized the absurdities and contradictions of the theistic religions, but surely, they thought, *something* supernatural existed. How else to account for the origin of the universe and the miracle of life's variety?\n\nEdwin Hubble began the answer to the first, and Charles Darwin the second. They gave us something precious: the ability to rationally justify belief in a world, a universe, a cosmos, as *just what it is.* A reality that explains itself, to those willing to put in the hard work of studying it, without something supernatural behind the curtain. So that even in our immense ignorance, we are still capable of distinguishing that ignorance, and accepting it, rather than filling in the gaps with our desires or traditions. So that even in our immense ignorance, we are still capable of distinguishing that ignorance, and accepting it, rather than filling in the gaps with our desires or traditions.\n\nAnd in accepting our ignorance, strive ever further to banish it, and fill those gaps with the best approximations of truth we can find.\n\nCharles Darwin's work was some of the most important in human history. Like all scientific findings, his discoveries would have been made eventually by someone else if he hadn't (and very nearly were), but he had not just the intelligence to discover the true mechanism of evolution, but also the courage to take what he saw as truth, and put his name on it, and weather the ridicule, scorn, and disbelief that it received. Much of modern medicine, our understanding of life's diversity and origins, and the fundamental unity of our species and connection to the rest of the planet's life, comes from his discoveries.\n\nFor that, I thank him, and I invite you all to as well.\n\nEdit:\n\nPeople bringing up Wallace should be aware of a few things, [despite his great contributions](http://darwin200.christs.cam.ac.uk/pages/index.php?page_id=d8):\n\n&gt;Darwin always put the emphasis on selection acting on individuals whereas Wallace apparently thought selection acted on groups or species. That selection acts on the individual, due to competition between individuals of the same species, is one of the key points in Darwin’s theory. Whether selection acted for “the good of the group” or on individuals was debated for a long time. **Now, however, it is generally accepted that Darwin was right and that selection acts primarily on individuals.**\n\n&gt;Another apparent difference is that Darwin emphasised competition within populations as the driving force for evolution, whereas Wallace put more emphasis on the species meeting the demands of a change in their environment. Wallace also seemingly disagreed with many of the terms Darwin coined. For example Wallace never appreciated the analogy between evolution and artificial selection which was one of Darwin’s key insights and the source of the term Natural Selection. **Wallace even scored out natural selection from his copy of On the Origin of Species and wrote ‘survival of the fittest’ in its place.**\n\n&gt;In later years the two men differed on other points, for example Darwin invoked other processes than natural selection to explain the evolution of particular characteristics. One of Darwin’s other key theories is sexual selection, which he viewed as an incredibly important process. Wallace however thought its effects were negligible and put more emphasis on natural selection. In his book Darwinism Wallace proposed alternative explanations to many of Darwin’s examples of sexual selection. In the 1970s sexual selection received increased attention from biologists after a long period of being largely forgotten. **Work since then has shown that Darwin was right; sexual selection is a key factor in the evolution of many traits.**\n\n&gt;Darwin and Wallace also disagreed on human evolution. For Darwin, all aspects of humans, including the emotions, conscious mind and intelligence could be explained by natural or sexual selection. **By the late 1860s Wallace had become a Spiritualist, and perhaps linked to this, began to reject evolutionary explanations of human intelligence and abilities invoking ‘the unseen universe of Spirit’.** This, he claimed, had intervened in the normal run of natural selection three times; at the creation of life, the introduction of consciousness, and the generation of man’s mental capacities. Later in his life Wallace also believed in teleology; the idea that the development of the universe has had a direction and that direction is towards the perfection of man. There are suggestions that Wallace also applied his teleology to evolution. Darwin was clearly a bit perplexed by his former ally’s new views and at one point wrote to Wallace pleading with him not to kill ‘our baby’.\n\nWallace formed a similar theory, but he was far less accurate in his specifics, and had far less data to prove his assertions, and was just flat out wrong in many of them.  It's not enough in science to be right but for the wrong reasons, and we should not lightly dismiss the spiritualist and supernatural insistence Wallace held onto when comparing which of the two great scientists was able to find a better approximation of truth.",

One of her arguments which I want to discuss is this:\n\nAtheism has been infected by people who joined the movement not because they find its rationality appealing, but to escape religion. This is largely because they were invited by many atheists, who promote atheism by criticising religion rather than by promoting the arguments against the existence of God. \n\nIn other words, religion-bashing broadened the movement but many of the newcomers only joined atheism to escape religion, not to actually embrace the atheist raison d'être. The argument is better explained at length by her so do watch the video, as /r/trueatheism members you will find it stimulating.\n\nI personally agree with her argument because I was shocked at the Francis-o-philia which followed the appointment of Francis as the new Catholic pope. This obsession with the new pope went beyond the wider society (just recall the media obsession with this) and remains very popular on reddit and other sites. The \"I'm an atheist but I love this pope\" became the phrase of the age. As someone who adheres to atheism because I think its silly to believe in a theistic god, I find it sad and disappointing that so many atheists would turn their convictions around only because the theists were now being nice.\n\nWhat do you guys think?

Lewis's [_Mere Christianity_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mere_Christianity), and by extension (and as described in his own book, [The Language of God](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Language_of_God:_A_Scientist_Presents_Evidence_for_Belief)) hinges on the universality of Moral Law.

        "text": "Hey there. I don't post here as much as I used to, but... for those who don't know me, I'm /u/koine_lingua. I'm a scholar of early Judaism and Christianity; and, here on Reddit, I'm the creator of /r/AcademicBiblical, and a frequent contributor to /r/AskHistorians (see my AskHistorians [profile](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/profiles/koine_lingua), which has links to many of the questions I've answered).\n\n________\n\nAlthough I'm an atheist, and my main interest is in early Judaism and Christianity, I had never really looked at Skeptic's Annotated Bible—until a couple of weeks ago. \n\nMy original impression was that this was a nice idea—and surely required a lot of work—but that it was, in short, fatally flawed. That is, its author may be *skeptical*, but not really *critical*: they were often working merely from a face-value interpretation, and were unfamiliar with (or at least didn't incorporate) the underlying socio-historical aspects of a verse or section, as well as the other finer points of academic interpretation—including knowledge of the original languages, etc.\n\nThis is why I've taken it upon myself to produce a new (digital) \"skeptical\" annotated Bible, with vastly expanded notes utilizing the best insights that academia has to offer. I'm tentatively titling my version *The Bible without God: A Critical Companion*; or CCB for short. \n\n_____\n\n\nOf course, the cry of \"context!\" is often something you hear *apologists* also say, who then try to twist this into a *defense* of some Biblical episode or doctrine.\n\nI'm convinced, however, that no truly critical examination of something in the Bible will do anything other than highlight its  *human* dimension: that religion emerges (solely) from human minds, human language, human culture, and nothing else. \n\nFunny enough, in a way, this is precisely what academic Biblical studies does in the first place—though largely on case-by-case basis. \n\nWhat, then, distinguishes this commentary from a normal academic one?\n\nI think there's something about the piecemeal, hyper-specialized/compartmentalized way that Biblical scholarship is done that makes it hard to see the \"big picture.\" I think this is confirmed in the fact that, even though this research does only serve to elucidate the (solely) human dimension of the Bible, it remains the case that a large number of Biblical scholars are still practicing Jews and Christians\n\n*This* is why we need a new skeptical/critical companion to the Bible. If literally *everything* that appears in the Bible—every verse, every claim—can be plausibly understood as the product human minds, human language, human culture, this can truly be understood as a Bible for which no (actual) God is needed. \n\n_____\n\n\nYet the claim of theists is not—*cannot* be—that the divine inspiration extends to the Biblical texts alone. Rather, the contention of most major denominations—born, really, out of logical necessity—is not just the inspiration of the texts, but that the Spirit dwells in the Church(es), creating a bridge between the texts and the minds of those who would interpret them. \n\nA Bible without the ability of humans to properly interpret it would be spiritually worthless.\n\nYet the irony is that it has only been the advent of modernity, where secular research is done highlighting the solely human dimension of the Bible (and undermining many traditional theological doctrines), that has allowed us to understood the Bible properly for the first time in history. Before the secular academic renaissance, even the best theological minds of yore couldn't compare the different religions and traditions from every corner of the world, from South America to Australia, and know their histories. They had no archaeology to speak of. They didn't excavate Mesopotamian cities; they couldn't decipher Akkadian, or Ugaritic, or Hittite (and in many ways, we know even more than the ancients did about the Hebrew and Greek of the Bible). They had no library where they could access, all in the same place, the *Iliad* and the *Bacchae*; the Dead Sea Scrolls; the entire Mishnah and Talmud. They had a primitive notion of the way that different Biblical texts were related to each other, and a narrow notion of authorial intent (always either too literal or too figurative). They had no real concept of source and redaction criticism like we do today, or stylometry, or a plethora of different Biblical manuscripts to compare.\n\n_____\n\n\nThis new critical companion will analyze Biblical texts in the context of ancient myth-making and propaganda. It will reveal the cognitive biases and narrow epistemological limits from which many Biblical theological claims/doctrines emerged. It will uncover intra-Biblical polemics and tensions, and illustrate the sources that the Biblical authors relied on, and how their own writings were reshaped (and abused) by other Biblical authors. \nFurther, it will highlight the history of the failure of traditional theological interpretation to produce useful and incisive Biblical insights and interpretations (with some erroneous interpretations having yielded important doctrines): insights that theologians are now dependent on secular research for.\n\nBut even beyond the failure of pre-modern interpretation, many problems remain today—including with the major Biblical translations themselves. Even the best of these lag behind the critical times: large committees forcing compromises, some beholden to theological interests, and overlooking numerous academic studies that have pointed out deficiencies in these translations, and have put forth unassailable solutions to some of the classic vexing translational issues.\n\nThis is why, in addition to detailed commentary on every verse, I'll also be producing my own translation, from the original Hebrew (and Aramaic) and Greek. These translations will certainly take academic consensuses into account, but will also diverge from major translations in places where they have neglected incisive linguistic/scholarly insights. \n\nI'll be consulting with colleagues in many places; so it won't be a one-man effort. In fact, I'm hoping that I can find someone like-minded who I can collaborate with, relieving some of the work load.\n\nFurther, the digital publication of the critical companion will allow for continual update, as further advances in scholarship are made, shifting the way we think about things.\n\n____\n\n\nI'm really not sure about the time-frame with which this project will proceed. I'll probably be releasing one Biblical book at a time (with some things having lower priorities, e.g. the Psalms).\n\nI welcome your advice / comments; and I definitely welcome people staying on top of me, to make sure I'm constantly working on this, to get it released as soon as possible.",

I made the argument based off of quantum mechanics, to which he literally responded with \"No, this is wrong, it is correct in terms of physics, but it is wrong in reality\". \n\nI was taken aback, literally. The argument then descended into my defense of physics and mathematics, with his argument being that mathematics is static while the world is not. He argued that the future does not exist, nor does the past, only the present moment. \n\nI brought up the multiverse, and he literally told me it is wrong with no support. Okay bro. \n\nBasically the conversation divelved into me defending science, while he attacked it. It was almost surreal, defending against claims such as: scientists do not know how to do their jobs and he knows it better than them, scientists need to stop being arrogant and trying to be philosophical, and science does not actually rely on empirical evidence (go figure). \n\nAnyways, it finished with him claiming that the mere existence of the earth and other things implies they have meaning. He mentioned that beavers produce these amazing structures, and there is no way they could know how to do that (yeah because evolution would not explain that right?). I finished by giving the example of the enzyme RuB3, in plants. This enzyme fixes carbon, and is arguably on of the most important pathways in the world - but this enzyme is HORRIBLY inefficient. This would not line up with the idea that God designed all these incredibly efficient and amazing organisms. \n\nAnyways, the only take away was the incredible arrogance of this man. A lawyer and philosopher, saying he knows more about science than scientists? It was disconcerting. Then I realized, all religion has an inherit arrogance. \n\nWhy is this? This is because you start with a preheld notion, a notion that you already have all the knowledge and understanding you need. That no matter what evidence is placed before you, you cannot be wrong, only the evidence can be. You simply work backwards to support your pre-held notions, disregarding or discrediting all evidence that may disagree with you. \n\nThis my friends, is quite dangerous. \n\nYes atheists can do it as well, but I think atheists and agnostics are much more \"honest\" truth seekers. \n\nNote: Excuse the poor grammar, writing from a mobile device and in a hurry. Also, I did not necessarily \"win\", it is one thing to sit down and take your time to make arguments, but in the moment it is much harder and there are a lot of points I simply could not argue against due to lack of knowledge or not having thought of them before. Also, a 20 year old student versus a 50 year old Philosophy Professor and Lawyer isn't exactly fair. \n\nEdit: Downvotes? And all the comments are about my agnosticism, not even the post. Nice. \n\n",

So suffice to say I have always felt ready to discuss the matter and explore atheism and religion conversationally.\n\n\nSo it came to me as a surprise when my five-year-old son, who just started kindergarten, came home and asked me what God and Jesus was. I asked him where he heard this, and he said at school. They were going around the classroom asking what they have to be thankful for this season, and a couple of kids invariably said God and or Jesus. So naturally, he asked me what God and Jesus were.\n\n\nAnd despite my years of atheistic exposure, I find myself somewhat at a loss as to how to explain this to a literal five-year-old in a simple and fair manner. Part of the issue is that with his age, he simply doesn't understand certain large concepts. \n\n\nNo doubt some of his new friends in kindergarden are religious, which is fine. And while I am not interested in him joining a religion personally, I want him to come to that conclusion on his own using his own critical thinking skills to which I am attempting to impart.\n\n\nSo my question is, how would you explain God or Jesus or maybe even religion in general to a five-year-old?",

Don't get me wrong, I'd love to see her leave her faith in the dust, but if anything I just want to provide some insight into why I feel the way I do, and leave it at that. If she wants to continue the discussion, awesome.\n\nFor anyone who's been in similar situations with younger teens / children, how did you handle it?\n\nMy email reply, as requested (thanks to those Redditors who helped me formulate a response!):\n\n&gt;Hi cousin,\n\n&gt;First of all, I wanted to say thank you for reaching out to me like this. I'm sorry I didn't answer your questions when you were asking me about this years ago, but at the time I didn't feel like it was an appropriate discussion to have. But, I'm happy we are talking about this today.\n\n&gt;I'd like to start off by stating my exact position. Atheism means a lack of belief in any gods. I am an agnostic atheist. This means that I don't believe in a god, but I also acknowledge that I cannot be 100% certain that a god does not exist, in the same way that I can't be 100% certain that Big Foot doesn't exist.\n\n&gt;I am a strong supporter of skepticism and critical thinking. Skepticism means not believing in something until you have been presented with good evidence to justify believing it. One of my primary goals in life is to believe as many true things and as few false things as possible, and I especially don't want to believe in anything for bad reasons, even if the thing I believe in happens to be true.\n\n&gt;I think that everyone should examine everything that they believe in order to make sure that the available evidence supports their conclusions. Many beliefs have held up to the test, but so far we haven't found any evidence that a god exists. However, I am always open to having my mind changed about anything if I am presented with logical arguments and solid evidence to support it.\n\n&gt;I have a slew of other reasons, but I won't bore you with all of the details unless you want to talk about it more. If you wish to share with me what you believe and why you believe it, please feel free. And if you would rather talk about this in person, I would be happy to listen to you over some coffee and muffins at Starbucks when I see you next month :)\n\n&gt;In the meantime, if you want some reading material to keep you busy, consider checking out the Iron Chariots wiki. There's a lot more information there pertaining to this topic than I could ever hope to cover in an email ---&gt; http://wiki.ironchariots.org\n\n&gt;Hope to hear back from you soon.\n\n&gt;Love,\n\n&gt;PGH_Snake\n\n**UPDATE:** Replied to her by email.  She thanked me and then asked if I would be interested in talking to her in person.  Then she sent me another text telling me that she showed my email to a friend of her's at school who is supposedly pretty knowledgeable of the Bible, and asked if I would be okay with him emailing me a response.  I told her I would prefer something of a group chat session where she can be involved or sit on the sidelines and watch.\n\n**TL;DR** having a theological debate over Google hangouts with a 10th grader at 6:00.\n\n**UPDATE 2:** Since it's becoming clearer that she might just be interested in trying to \"save\" me, I made sure she asked her parents if it was okay to talk with me and they were fine with it.  They'll probably be hovering or wanting to read the chat afterwards, so I'll be sure to be on extra good behavior :U\n\n**UPDATE 3:** Got a text reply from her dad.  \"...don't feel obligated and if you are uncomfortable with what she asks you can just let her.  She loves you PGH_Snake, we all do.  I think she is just curious.  Thank you for your kindness toward her.

Her friend can't hop on tonight due to soccer practice or something, and I'll be busy today through Saturday. =\\ \n\n**UPDATE 5:** Sunday after church won't work for either of them so we're going to shoot for next week.

        "text": "I was listening to the Thinking Atheist's recent cast (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZWUtBteorA) in which he mentions this survey about what people think are the most valuable or influential books in history (http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/13/folio-society-survey-bible-edges-out-darwin). \n\nI was rather surprised by the results. We of course get the Bible at the top and the Koran somewhere in there too and we also get important science books like Newton's Principia and Einstein's Relativity but there was a conspicuous absence of influential historical philosophy authors that I would have expected like Plato, Aristotle, Lucretius, John Stuart Mill, Kant, etc. Do people underestimate the role of philosophy and politics in the history of humanity, civilizations and beliefs? Are they simply ignorant of these texts. \n\nThe religious texts have been influential obviously but it wasn't just religious texts that caused the Magna Carta or the advent of enlightenment principles like the *secular* rule of law. \n\nAlso the scientific texts seem overrepresented as the alternative to the religious ones when the development of human cultures and civilizations are at least as influenced by more abstract ideological notions and may actually have been isolated from the advancements in scientific academia.\n\nAnyone else have thoughts on any of this?",

        "text": "I've been in a conversation about morals. The other person insists that there can be no absolute moral foundation without god (specifically the Christian God). I think this is a foolish idea in general, but I'm not altogether certain about morality. I recently read Alex Rosenberg's *An Atheist's Guide to Reality* and he is basically promoting nihilism; specifically what he refers to as nice nihilism. This idea makes a lot of sense, because I find it difficult (perhaps impossible) to establish bedrock for moral ideas like Sam Harris's that morality is intrinsically linked to the well-being of conscious creatures. I've also watch the [debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rm2wShHJ2iA&amp;spfreload=10) between Shelly Kagan and William Lane Craig, and I really like what Kagan is promoting. It is essentially John Rawls's Theory of Justice using the veil of ignorance. So, basically I have formulated a thought about morals using an analogy with mathematics.\n\nCould morals be like mathematics? I first heard this idea from Tim Maudlin when he was [speaking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaEcylMvR5Q&amp;list=TLwhWVWhvj9uU) (go to ~27:00) at the Greer-Heard Forum. The idea is that morals are on a similar abstract plane as mathematics, in that, with thought, we can discover and further understand morality. Just as mathematics are absolute (in our universe at least), so is morality. However, just as in mathematics, we are forced to establish fundamental truth as axioms. Consider that starting with different axioms can lead to the development of different mathematical theorems, such as Riemann versus Euclidean geometry. So, for morals, we start with an axiom, perhaps something like the original position and the veil of ignorance, or perhaps even simpler \"Don't harm; do help.\" From this axiom (or axioms), we can build our moral framework, and it is absolute, at least in a similar sense that math is absolute. Hence, if we look at the moral progress made on slavery, we can draw a comparison. In viewing slavery as wrong, we gained deeper understanding of morals in the same way that when Newton (or Liebniz) discovered calculus, we gained a deeper understanding of mathematics.\n\nDo this make sense? Please critique this idea; I am interested in getting as much feedback as possible.",

For the majority of my life, I've identified as a christian; but, after much education and deep reflection, it was only inevitable that I came to the conclusion that atheists were right. At the close of this year I will have been an agonistic-atheist for 3 years. Now that I am a fully grown adult, I am troubled that most of my life will be spent in my cube, at my computer, writing, developing, and correcting stack trace errors. The money is more than enough compensation, but I fear that it won't be a life worth lived. We all have to submit to the daily grind in one way or another, but with the atheist perspective things have changed. So what do I do? This doesn't necessarily have to be a \"bucket list\", but what have you decided to do with your one precious shot at life?\n\n\n**Edit 1 day Later:** Thank you guys for all the different responses and perspectives.

Under the assumption that God doesn't exist, any phenomena claimed to have been observed that would require God as an explanation *has* to be a hallucination. Since it didn't really happen, it must have been imagined. \n2. Would religion still exist without hallucinations. I feel like this is the actual problem with this particular argument.\n\nPeople seemed to only be arguing about point 1, but it seems to be quite evident that people (Even if they aren't crazy) will sometimes hallucinate under the right conditions. If these people didn't realize that they were hallucinating, it could very well enforce the belief in a deity. \n\nIt seems to me though, that many people would still believe in religion because of simple indoctrination and wishful thinking. One doesn't have to claim that they have experienced something supernatural to be religious. Maybe it helps keep people religious? \n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

It's the equivalent of saying \"If we came from monkeys, why are there still monkeys?\" It's not an argument against god, it's simply a question that has nuanced answers.\n\nJust like how exploring the monkey question gives a better understanding of evolution, exploring the \"Bad things to good people\" question gives a better understanding of theology.\n\nOne reason god could allow bad things to happen is the same reason you wouldn't protect your child from every single scrape and bruise. And just like how when you're a kid scraping your knee feels like the worst thing in the world, but really isn't a big deal, the same might be said of war and torture from the celestial point of view.\n\nThink about how much growth we've made in the last 200,000 years. If there were no winter, no death, no predators, no malice, no disease, no hunger, no *Bad Things*, do you think we would have made any advancement? No, we would have been content with paradise, had sex all day, and hung out with talking snakes.\n\nThe reason I can talk to you through a network of connected artificial brains is because we've made advancements through strife. I once asked my hydraulic engineering professor over a beer if he thought war was worth it, due to all the scientific advancements to come from humans killing other humans. He couldn't say 'no', and he is one of the biggest peace loving hippies I've ever met.\n\nIs this an argument for the existance of god? Fuck no, but it certainly isn't an argument against it.",

        "text": "Something I don't quite understand is a common Christian view that free will is a necessity, but it also comes with the ability to sin, and that the two cannot be separate. The reason for this allegedly being that the Christian god wanted us to freely choose to obey and exalt him and that he didn't want us to be automatons that simply did as he asked, thus free will to make the choice to do so, but also the choice to do evil instead.\n\nSo, is there free will in heaven? Because, if so, what happens to our capacity to sin? Is it gone? Why didn't we just start out that way? If there's *no* free will in heaven, then we end up being the obedient automatons that this god allegeldy didn't want us to be in the first place, except now for all eternity. Is there a good apologetic/counter-argument to this?",

        "text": "**Verificationism's Key Principle:** that only statements about the world that are logically necessary are *cognitively meaningful* - making theology, metaphysics, and evaluative judgements, such as ethics and aesthetics, as *cognitively meaningless* “pseudostatements”.\n\nA claim is **cognitively meaningful** if and only if it's either *analytic* (true because of logical connections and the meaning of the terms) or *empirically verifiable* (some conceivable set of experiences could test whether it was true or false).\n\nEthical, metaphysical, aesthetic, theological truths or knowledge are, according to verificationism, impossible or factually unknowable. They are \"cognitively meaningless\". To reason with others on these topics, eventually you have to appeal to emotional means and can no longer use reason.\n\nSome simple questions to test whether or not you'd agree with verificationism:\n\n1. Do you think statements that are neither *analytic* nor *empirically verifiable* are worth less consideration than statements which are? (These would be synthetic statements that are qualitative and not quantitative).\n\n2. Do you disagree with the idea that even direct observations must be collected, sorted, and reported with guidance and are constrained by theory (like \"cognitively meaningless\" statements are), which sets a horizon of expectation and interpretation, how observational reports, never neutral, are laden with theory?\n\n3. Do you disagree with the idea that metaphysical, ethical, and aesthetic statements are often rich with meaning while also underpinning or fueling the origin of scientific theories?\n\n\nI ask because the concepts discussed within verificationist principles often relate to the ways by which atheists think about and discuss the accepted formulas for reason and logic, especially as they relate to what can and can't be known about the creation of the universe, God, and the supernatural.",

I believe everyone from Christians to Muslims to Scientologists to Satanists should be allowed to practice their religions despite the fact that I don't agree with them. These religions should be protected from persecution (not criticism). Also, I understand that Last Week Tonight is a comedy news network, but that doesn't change the impact it has on viewers ideas and also the social climate that we exist in, which I suppose is what I'm commenting on today.\n\nBut for whatever reason this quick little blurb really resonated with me. **\"The phrase Islam is a cancer isn't held by people who are willing or open to new ideas\"**, mainly because I don't particularly agree with it. I mean sure, the term \"cancer\" is definitely on the harsh side, but I'd argue a similar stand point that Sam Harris made a few weeks ago on television (which I'm sure you have all seen by now). In addition to his points, I think it's worth noting that Islam as a religion spreads both geographically and in population relatively quickly, as does Christianity. I don't believe that makes me close minded. Now, I guess that's what close minded people tend to say, but I think I'm \"willing or open to new ideas\". To me, quite a few of these shows have a liberal bias to them, and it almost outlines how we as liberals (for those of you who aren't liberal, the point still stands) tip toe around a lot of religious criticism in order to remain politically correct. I feel like that's problematic, and while this was an *incredibly* small portion of this episode, I feel like it's a quality example of this phenomenon. \n\nWhat are your thoughts? Also, if you all think I'm being blunt or completely insensitive, I totally get that. My views are pretty dynamic in that regard, and are certainly open to reformatting. Thanks!\n",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/2ly5ql/finding_our_own_meaning_in_life_is_delusional/",
        "text": "If materialism, naturalism, and scientism are true, then you would be delusional to find meaning in your life (as stated by materialism, naturalism, and scientism which state that life is just a bunch of meaningless atoms and particles).  There are things in science that do have objective meaning. For example, the fact that the Earth revolves around the sun is a scientific fact and you would, therefore, be delusional to think otherwise. Same thing with creating our own meanings in life since life really has no meaning in terms of science.  You would, therefore, be delusional in finding your own personal meanings in life since life has no meaning.  If you are going to say something here such as that this is a logical fallacy I am presenting here, then what I would have to say in return is that your own personal viewpoints in that people would not be delusional in creating their own meanings in life, this would also be a logical fallacy since finding your own personal meanings in life when life has no meaning is a contradiction.  I don't even care if it's in our evolutionary design to find meaning in life in order to survive and benefit our survival.  You would still be delusional in finding your own meanings in life anyway.\n\nNow you might also be thinking that, since it is in our evolutionary design to find meaning in life in order to survive and benefit our survival, that to even perceive this as delusional would contradict our evolutionary design and would be a delusional viewpoint in of itself in terms of evolution as a result.  But this would be false because the only way for it to contradict our evolutionary design is if we were to tell ourselves the message that \"We are not designed by evolution to find meaning in our lives.\"  That would be the only message that would contradict our evolutionary design.  Telling ourselves that \"We are delusional in finding meaning in our lives\" does not contradict our evolutionary design.\n\nTo say that something IS when, in reality, it is not, would be delusional regardless of what you think otherwise.  So any personal meanings you create in life are your brain's way of telling you that these meanings ARE.  Even if you tell yourself something such as that these meanings you create are not objective (definite) meanings, the fact is, for you to view these personal meanings as true for yourself and for your personal life is your mind's way of telling you that these meanings are definite meanings which would be false since they are not.  It would be saying that since even you as a person are a bunch of meaningless atoms and particles, that any personal meanings you create hold true for you which would be false because you would be saying that you and this life both have meaning while at the same time they both don't have meaning which is contradictory.\n\nSo for you to believe that any personal meaning you create in life holds true for you and holds true for your own personal life would be no different than saying that \"I know that it's a scientific fact that the Earth revolves around the sun.  But I don't have to believe that it holds true for me as a person nor that it holds true for me in my own personal life and that I can create any personal meaning I want and instead believe that meaning holds true for me and holds true for my own personal life.  I can believe anything I want such as that the Earth is flat and is the center of the universe and that words don't have to mean what they mean or that scientific facts have to be what they are.  I can say that the color blue is actually the color black, that hot is cold, etc. and this will hold true for me and my own personal life while in actual reality itself it doesn't hold true at all.  And even if these personal meanings don't hold true at all for me and in my own personal life, I can still have them anyway in my life and live by them anyway.\"\n\nSo as you can see here, this would be nonsense since it is a scientific fact that life has no meaning and that we are also a bunch of meaningless atoms and particles.  This is no different than the mindset of a religious person who has a delusional belief in a God and the supernatural.  Therefore, it's not just religious people and delusional people who are the only ones delusional.  Even atheists, highly intelligent people, and scientists themselves can be delusional here.  Sure, you can still live by those personal meanings you have created in life despite knowing that they are not true since this universe does not tell us how we should think, but it would all still be nonsense anyway.  I don't even care about the fact that if we didn't have any created personal meanings in life, that we would all be dead since we would all just be sitting there and not finding any reason to get up and eat, socialize, or do any other activities.  We would all still be living nonsensical and delusional lives anyway for being human and living our personal lives and making the best of this life regardless of the fact that this is in our evolutionary design to do so and that this is how evolution designed us.  It's only if this life had an objective meaning through there being a God and an afterlife of eternal joy would we find reason to live our lives and find that meaning in our lives.\n\nNow if you are going to ask something such as that \"To be is not to be? To be is not the way to be?\" what I would have to say to that would be that there is no \"way\" in the first place since even that quoted word is a personal meaning.  Also, to say that concepts such as value, worth, and beauty do exist in this universe, but are not things that are scientific and can't be defined by science and, therefore, you are free to live by them and not view them as being delusional since they are separate from this universe and are not a part of this meaningless universe and can't be defined by this meaningless universe, this would be false. These concepts are created by the meaningless atoms and particles in our brains that come up with these concepts in the first place (so these might be measurable concepts in the future through advanced neurological technology that can measure the amount of value, worth, and beauty in this person's mind by measuring the amount of activity of those atoms and particles that have created these concepts in this person's mind). Therefore, these concepts ARE the functioning of those atoms and particles that have created them in our brains and are, therefore, meaningless as well and to view them as being true for yourself and true for your personal life would be delusional nonsense.\n\nHow we come to the conclusion (the scientific fact) that this universe is meaningless is through scientific evidence.  Therefore, you might be thinking that since there is also scientific evidence for created personal meanings being accomplished as something meaningful in life, in helping ourselves and others, doing great things in life, keeping us alive, etc. that this would somehow mean that these created meanings are not delusional nonsense.  But this would be false.  This entire universe and everything in it is all meaningless and the meaningless of all these things is what defines even our own personal created meanings in life.  The scientific fact of this universe being meaningless tells us that our created meanings are false just like how the scientific fact of the Earth revolving around the sun tells us that we would be false to have created personal meanings that say things such as that the Earth is the center of the universe and that the sun revolves around the Earth instead.\n\nIf you are going to say something such as that \"Of course it doesn't. You might as well say that Newton's law of gravitation explains why I don't like garlic.\"  \n\nWhat I would have to say to that would be that other scientific properties besides gravity does explain why we come up with personal meanings.  Since it is just the functioning of the atoms and particles in our brains that create meaning, then it is the scientific properties that define these atoms and particles in our brains and how they function which is what explains why we come up with meanings and why we perceive things the way we do (such as why we like something or don't like it or any other created meaning for that matter).  It would be the wiring of our brains and other scientific properties that explain how and why we have personal meanings in life.\n\nNow if you are going to ask me something such as for me to define \"meaning,\" what I would have to say to that would be that there is no meaning. It is just a bunch of atoms and particles and that is it. But this would only hold true for things besides scientific facts such as the Earth revolving around the sun and also the scientific fact that this life has no meaning.\n\nFinally, even Stephen Hawking himself has stated that philosophy is dead and that science is all there is.  The viewpoints that others have regarding that you can find your own personal meanings in life and that this would not be delusional, these are philosophical viewpoints which would actually be \"dead\" (false).",

Everyone kind of laughed except one guy who said \"Well that's just specialization - not evolution.\" and I asked him for more info. He says \"We haven't ever seen one species change into another - DNA doesn't ever change so much that it changes species\" and went on to rattle off a bunch of stuff about how species adapt specializations but never change their actual species. I realized what I had done and wasn't going to argue (because I love my job) so I just told him \"Listen, this is something I feel very strongly about and would normally debate this with you all day but I would rather not do this because someone will end up upset. I'm no longer interested in this conversation.\" \n\nMy point for this post is - some of that is *technically* correct about a species specializing for various tasks but only loosely. How does one argue this? And furthermore, my google-fu is failing me when I'm trying to search for examples of something changing enough for a species reclassification - has this happened? I know the big problem with something like this is the timeframe - humans don't live NEARLY long enough to witness long term evolution but I know we can demonstrate evolution in how bacteria have changed over time but have those changes ever been enough that they've been reclassified? Or have we changed any species of animals based on short term evolution? And lastly, at what point is DNA so different from the original animal that we reclassify it?\n\nI know /r/trueatheism is probably the wrong place for this, but I think you'll understand why I posted here.",

It bases its stance on the presumption that one should have a belief regarding the existence of god. However, this is very religious-centric. I don't consider atheism to require any faith because I have no inherent obligation to believe in the existence of a god. The \"faith\" that is being argued is the faith that the world as I know it and has been consistently demonstrated to be so is, in fact, a lie. The possibility of an omnipotent omnipresent deity does not fit into the world as I have observed it, and therefore it takes no faith to disregard theories with no basis in evidence or logical theory. It's an invisible pink unicorn situation. It takes no faith to disavow that which demonstrably should not exist.",

        "text": "To give some context, I grew up in a family made up on one side of Two-by-Twoers (sometimes called Workers) and on the other, staunchly conservative Lutherans. I live in Eastern Montana which is home to a few mega-churches and plenty of nose in the air \"Christians.\" I attended a private K-12 Lutheran school and (begrudgingly) went to church every Sunday.\n\nI have had a couple distinct moments of what the religious might call \"spiritual awakenings.\" The funny thing is, both of these moments came from anti-theists. \n\nThe first was when I read the God Delusion in my first years of college. It felt like Dawkins cracked an egg on my head. All the past guilt and worry I had been harboring from years of indoctrination just washed away and I was able to revel in the beauty of a self-propelled existence and the joy of personal empirical observation.\n\nUnfortunately, I made the mistake many new atheists made and flew strongly in the face the of my family and burned some bridges I may never be able to repair. I made the mistake of making my catch-phrase a flippant \"I doubt it,\" regarding any religious quandaries or concerns.\n\nA year later after receiving a diagnosis of manic depression I found myself reeling from a crippling psychosis. I had grandiose delusions of perceiving myself to be a reincarnated disciple, Jesus Christ, the Antichrist and John the Baptist. These moods swung violently between psychotic mania and depression as my psyche tried to make sense of the condition with the aid of years of religious fervor and brainwashing. The nursing staff was either religious or didn't want to offend my parents so I was never outright dissuaded from religiosity or delusion through rationale.\n\nFortunately, there was a social worker who (from my assumption) was not a religious person in a sea of bible thumping nurses. My talks with him came as nothing short of a small and intense personal experience of enlightenment. He taught me about mindfulness using DBT (dialectic behavior therapy) and was able to give my logical mind something empirical to grasp onto.\n\nI am confident if not for this person, this ungodly saint, I would have been institutionalized in a mental hospital where I may never have recovered. I feel immensely for those that go through mental illness with only the guide of religion to help them and it pains me that they are victims of a society that promotes conversions over understanding.\n\nThis mindfulness led me to meditation and Buddhist practice. My rejection of \"taking things on faith\" led to my acceptance of medication and therapy. I am healthier and more clear-headed thank I have ever been in my life under the thumb of other peoples' gods.\n\nFinally, this subreddit has helped me stay the course when the delusions start to creep in (Zyprexa helps too). I felt I had to come out of lurking to thank all of you. Keep doing what you're doing because it can have an immense effect on a person. For the better. \n\nI am eternally grateful for what goes on here. Thanks, guys.\n\n\n**tl;dr:** religion nearly helped put me in the looney bin forever. genuine non-religious people are the ones that truly helped me manage mental illness.\n\n\n",

There is a downside to that though: there's also no one to take care of assholes. As a Christian it's easy to just say \"meh, god'll punish them somehow\" but I can't do that as an atheist which means I have to either do the punishing myself and might get I trouble for it or let it go.\n\nAny thoughts on the matter?",

Big thanks to /u/bionikspoon for figuring it out and posting a link!** \n\nWithin the last six months I encountered a link to a debate on here that I've since lost. I'm looking to review it and share it. \n\nIt was a full length debate, about 3 hours, and available on YouTube.  It was between two very educated people, one was an atheist (astrophysicist?) who had invented an eternal model of the universe, where matter and time were interconnected.  The other was also a ~~scientist~~ Christian theologian, but accepted a prime mover.\n\nThey did not discuss the validity of the Bible, but just whether or not a prime mover was necessary for the existence of the universe.  \n\nThe debate really came down to a split hair.  The atheist accepted a view of time where past, present, and future exist simultaneously.  He used the phrase \"There was no beginning of time, just a first moment in time.\" The theist/deist accepted a linear view of time, where the future was not valid until human consciousness experienced it.  \n\nBoth parties accepted the age of the universe, evolution, human biases of religion.  The argument was almost entirely about Deism.  \n\nThere was a Q&amp;A after the debate, where the audience alternated between who was asked a question.  The person the question was directed to got 2 minutes to answer, and the other got a 1 minute response.  \n\nI remember that during the atheist's first response, he very clearly broke down every single point the deist made and responded to it. The deist's response was to repeat his first points.  During the atheist's next response, he pretty much reiterated that he has already discussed every point the other person had made, and used the time to discuss his model of the universe.  \n\nThey pretty much agreed at the end that their perception of time influenced their individual philosophical need for a prime mover, and were very civil about this being a somewhat legitimate reason to disagree.  \n\nI will note that the Deist was visibly shaken up towards the end, and stopped refuting certain points when he realized he had made a logical leap or error.  \n\nI think the person arguing that the God hypothesis was *not* viable's name was Mark, but I can't remember for sure.  \n\nthanks in advance!",

Or at least that is the way I understand it.  But why is moral epistemology - the study of how we know what is moral or not - a bigger problem for him?\n\nAs a secondary question - why does anyone find the argument that goodness is god's nature compelling?  In that model how would you discern god from satan?  How would you know which one is 'good' as you're defining good by the nature of the deity not by the actions themselves.\n\nFinally - as I mentioned - I have a limited knowledge of philosophy so please - maybe not ELI5 but perhaps ELI first year college.",

It would appear to me that Epicureanism or or Personal/Individual Egoism would be the most easily defended consequentialist perspective while deontologically no action seems to be unequivocally good or bad. So any discussion of Natural Rights necessarily fails before it starts because of its necessity for a foundation from which to construct the notion.\n\nOn the other hand, Meta-Ethics usually leads down the road of moral nihilism, at least in my estimation, and any attempt to argue for moral realism has no real endpoint except failure.\n\nThis then leads to the problem of an atheist criticizing injustice in various religions or the moral depravity of the deity in question. If there is no foundation for objective moral knowledge than why should one not simply ignore an atheist critique of the moral attributes of a God or gods.\n\nAgain, I appreciate all discussion on the topic and I would like to be corrected on many of these matters because at the moment I'm having a hard time providing the perspective.",

But I won't back down either. I want to discuss science and end up with this BS. I always thought those were fairytales for kids, and I was shocked when I realized that grown ups truly believe in them and I was 6 years old back then. If a kid has enough brains to figure out that religion is BS to the power of BS, then how come adults have problems getting it. So I never thought that there was any reason to discuss these kinda things. Man was I wrong. The more I talk to people the more I realize that most of them hold questionable believes in higher powers. How can people be so simple-minded and gullible to believe in such things. Is it so hard to open up a science textbook and read a little. It might even help, if they at least read the book they believe in. But even that is too much. Blind faith is always in. \n\n\n\n\nI don't care if someone is moderately religious or a crazy level fundamentalist. They are both crazy. Most people I know could be classified as moderately religious. And I find the moderates worse, because they are the cherry-pickers. In fact many of them seem to be at least agnostic without realizing it. Yet they call themselves Christian, Muslim or whatever, which bothers me to no end. How can people, who are smart enough to see that many things in the bible and other scriptures are not true, still call themselves Christian or whatever, even though they don't follow said scripture. At least call yourself an agnostic if you are unsure, but don't start defending religion if you barely believe in it. How is it possible that they can't come to the logical conclusion that if many things in the bible are wrong, that the whole thing is wrong. Why start argueing that most of it is meant metaphorically, when it is obviously not. For centuries everybody thought it was literal and now they tell me that it was meant to be metaphorical. Are they kidding themselves. Why does every religious person believe that he has the one and only right interpretaion?\n\n\n\n\nWe live in a time with free access to knowledge and school education for everyone (At least in the western world). Why do so many people consciously avoid learning. Am I expecting too much of my fellow humans? It can't be that hard, or can it? \n\nI'm also including esoterics, conspiracy theorists, and any modern age myths which start spreading all the time. \n ",
