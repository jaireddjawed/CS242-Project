        "text": "My employer recently held a sale of six company vehicles via a blind auction.  Six boxes, one for each vehicle, were placed in the break room for employees to submit sealed envelopes with written bids.  One rule in particular caught my attention:\n\n\"... in years past we have had employees bid on and win multiple vehicles but then only desire to pay for one of them.  If you win multiple vehicles you will be expected to purchase all or get none.\"\n\nThis prohibition on conditional, multi vehicle bidding made me wonder if my employer wasn't leaving potential auction revenue on the table.  How would someone willing to outspend all other bidders to buy any single vehicle (but who was unwilling to buy more than one) register their intent?  What about someone who wanted either vehicle A or vehicle B, but not C-F?  They should be able to submit a \"Exclusive Or\" bid for A/B.\n\nHow would you efficiently process conditional multi lot bidding in a blind auction (i.e. \"I'm willing to spend x on any one of these multiple items, but I don't want to buy two\").  How could a seller maximize their potential profit when selling multiple items while allowing any combination of bids?",

        "text": "Consider the Laplace operator ∆=-D\\^2+I. Using Fourier transforms, we can transform ∆ into ξ\\^2+1, and invert the operator as 1/(ξ\\^2+1). Therefore, if we have a differential equation of form ∆f = g it can be solved (up to constants and such) as f = ∆^(-1)g = ∫∫ e^(i(x-y)ξ) u(y)/(ξ\\^2+1)dydξ. A double integral is very inconvenient to compute. Thus, if we decide to switch the order of integration, we obtain something like ∫u(y) e^(-|x-y|)dy, and changing the order of integration is valid because 1/(ξ\\^2+1) decays fast enough. \n\nHowever, suppose we similarly wish only to have to deal with a single integral to compute ∆. In that case, it is no longer valid in a classical sense to switch the order of integration, as the real part of the inner integral becomes ∫cos((x-y)ξ)(ξ\\^2+1) which of course very badly diverges. \n\nNonetheless, I reasoned in the following, *highly* informal manner. Notice that ∫cos((x-y)ξ)(ξ\\^2)e^(-a|ξ|) converges for a&gt;0. In fact, we have the value is equal to 4a\\*(a^(2)\\-3(x-y)^(2))/(a^(2)\\+(x-y)^(2))^(3). Now, here's where it gets bad. If we plug in a=0, this becomes 0 *unless* (x-y) = 0. Thus, the inner integral should be zero everywhere except as y=x. In that case, we plug in 0 for a and 0 in for (x-y) to obtain 4\\*(0)\\*((0)^(2)\\-3\\*(0)^(2))/((0)^(2)\\+(0)^(2))^(3)=4\\*(-2\\*(0)\\^3)/(8\\*(0)\\^6) = -1/0\\^3. \n\nNow, how do we compute u(0)\\*(-1/0\\^3). Well, we have that u(0)/0\\^3 is like u(z)/z\\^3 at z=0, and if we integrate ∮u(z)/z\\^3 we obtain exactly -u''(0). Doing something nearly identical for  ∫cos((x-y)ξ)(1)e^(-a|ξ|) and treating the 1/0 as ∮u(z)/z again gives us u(y). Thus, we obtain the expected result that  ∫∫ e^(i(x-y)ξ) u(y)(ξ\\^2+1)dydξ  = -u'' + u.\n\nThere isn't anything special about (ξ\\^2+1), doing this with other polynomials similarly yields the correct result. I am curious if there is some underlying and rigorous theory behind why this happens to work. I'm already aware that the switching of integration can be supported in a distributional sense, and the inner integral becomes derivative of the delta function. However, I'm interested in such distributional facts can be recovered through some sort of complex analysis perspective. \n\nAnd more generally, I'm curious if there is some sort of connection between distributions and complex analytic approaches. My original interest in a question was spurred by the observation that ∑cos(2πnx)+1/2 converges to the Dirac comb in the distributional sense, and this is important for solutions of the heat equation. However, one also has that 1/(e^(2πiz)\\-1)+1/2 is an important function in complex analysis since it has a residue of 1 at integer. Moreover, its real part is formally exactly ∑cos(2πnx)+1/2 and thus there seems to be an interesting connection between the integrating over distributions and integrating around the complex plane. I am curious if such a connection actually exists, or is only a coincidence brought about by these examples.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/10lcgb3/here_are_all_4d_hypertoruses_including_the_tiger/",
        "text": "This is a long post so you can look at which ever specific shape you are interested in.\n\nHere's some nice ways to visualise and understand all 4D hypertoruses. There are in total 4 of them and I will order them in terms of difficulty/complexity.\n\nCredit to [**http://hi.gher.space/**](http://hi.gher.space/) for the amazing visuals.\n\n(Just remember that the following pictures show each slice of the shape along the fourth dimension, where left and right correspond to the fourth direction)\n\nNumber 1: the Spheritorus. This is the easiest one because it is literally identical to a 3D torus, except for the fact that it has 4D thickness. It is basically a circle with 4D thickness.\n\n[This is one angle of a spheritorus \\(the right and left directions are represented as the fourth direction, w\\). As you can see, it just looks like a circle. It can be constructed by rotating a sphere about a point outside of the sphere \\(offset\\).](https://preview.redd.it/atx7b5now7ea1.jpg?width=444&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ea36b66d0847e31c894eea1d78cec5ead7338f4a)\n\n[This is another angle of the same shape. The torus at the center is the main shape, and the other toruses around it are basically just the added 4D thickness.](https://preview.redd.it/5v0zwf3yx7ea1.jpg?width=447&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=cf518f9d3438540a2555b1b230d2b1b65f6435ec)\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/br75xx5p99ea1.gif\n\nNumber 2: the Ditorus/3-torus. The ditorus is very similar to a spheritorus, except it has a cut out hole all through the round \"tube\" part of the torus. The hole takes the shape of a smaller spheritorus-hyperbola. I realise that may be confusing to understand, bear with me. The 3D analogue of a ditorus would be a torus with cut out hole all through the round \"tube\" part of the torus, essentially making it a hollow torus. It is basically a hollow torus with 4D thickness.\n\n[As you can see, this looks similar to the spheritorus, but it has a hyperhole running all around the torus. A ditorus can be constructed by rotating a 3D torus about a point outside of the torus.](https://preview.redd.it/pzsxdgllv8ea1.jpg?width=411&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4b6ccd18ec81080bc203511e0c85975f589f35f1)\n\n[This is another angle of the same shape. Again, it looks similar to the spheritorus, but as you can see there is a hyperhole cut around the torus. The toruses get thicker and then thinner and then vanishes. The torus at the center is the main shape, and the other toruses around it are basically just the added 4D thickness.](https://preview.redd.it/njfnlmb6w8ea1.jpg?width=424&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=de1f0852e5ab584e0d05f53015d4d87fc5c9bb79)\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/wnvpbady99ea1.gif\n\nNumber 3: the Torisphere. The torisphere is like a real 4D torus in the way that every aspect about it is one dimension higher than a normal torus, unlike the spheritorus which is very similar to a torus. The torisphere can be thought of as a hypersphere with a \"hypertube\" (4D hyperbola) cut out all the way through the hypersphere. This is analogous to how a 3D torus can be thought of as a sphere with a tube cut out all the way through the sphere making a hole and thus creating a torus shape. The torisphere is basically a sphere with 4D thickness, but remember a sphere in 4D has a hole in the middle so that's what makes it a torus.\n\n[So as you can see this looks almost like a hypersphere but there is a hole in the shape of a tube basically which is why the slices look like donuts, not spheres. It is important to understand that the hole in the middle is not a hyperspherical hole, but a hypertube hole. It passes all the way through the shape. If it were a hyperspherical hole, the cross-sections would look like half hollow spheres, instead of toruses.](https://preview.redd.it/4lbesa5k19ea1.png?width=676&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7eadfa8a15fb21b66de7828d63bce3274e122bbe)\n\n[This is another angle of the same shape. Maybe it is easier to see the hole in this picture. This again looks like a hypersphere except for the hole. So where is the hole? Imagine a line that passes through the very left side of the screen to the very right side of the screen. The line would be moving in the fourth dimension. This line would pass through each sphere with nothing blocking the way, that is the tube that makes this a 4D torus. The sphere in the center is the main shape, and the other spheres around it are basically just added 4D thickness.](https://preview.redd.it/cewetlwa29ea1.png?width=676&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f06eab988f4ce50598c440b94e43ec8429105e00)\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/9mk7v9u0a9ea1.gif\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[This is not the best visualisation but I made for another person I was talking to u\\/Rhonnosaurus.](https://preview.redd.it/34rw2s6aj9ea1.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ae73af342be6b8c6445ffdaa23af4e4ed2a37b50)\n\nFinally, number 4: the Tiger. Cool name. This one is the hardest to understand. The tiger is actually quite similar to the ditorus because it's cross sections look like two toruses. A ditorus can be constructed by rotating a torus about a point outside and PARALLEL to it and tracing its path, and a tiger can be constructed by moving a torus in a circle about a point that is PERPENDICULAR to it (without rotating it) and tracing its path. So just imagine in your head moving a horizontal torus around in a circle going up, left, down, then right (NOT rotating). If you trace the torus on this path, you get a tiger, well of course the circle will have to be in a perpendicular direction, namely the fourth direction.\n\n[The tiger is basically what you get if you moved a torus around in a circle \\(in 4D\\) without rotating it and traced it's path. It is a very \\\\\"open\\\\\" shape.](https://preview.redd.it/y0bliqwu79ea1.png?width=676&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2ae3c06214390214858bf265d66bc9a37f1f9f24)\n\n[This may seem a little complicated, but you can see that the toruses \\(the solid ones\\) are revolved around a point perpendicular to it in a circle in the fourth dimension \\(red and blue lines\\). The solid toruses correspond to the toruses at the center of the picture above this one.](https://preview.redd.it/y0gmmdv7a9ea1.png?width=769&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7ca1abaf90527e35f52027f221b458ed9f8bd8e7)\n\n[Love it](https://i.redd.it/uk7pni7k99ea1.gif)\n\nI hope you found my guide to 4D toruses helpful, any feedback would be appreciated. Of course, there is so much more to be said than can be put in one post. See ya'll.",

I've noticed how important functional analysis is for mathematical physics and so I would like to learn it in detail on my own. \n\nThe two books I am thinking of using is Lax and Reed/Simon Vol I. The latter seems to be exactly what I want since it focuses on mathematical physics, but a few friends of mine have told me that Lax is as easier read with better exposition (and easier to understand proofs), covers more, and is more modern. What do you all think of these two books? Can anyone vouch for one book over another?",

There are lots of methods to produce \"random numbers\" and \"random distributions\".  \n\nBut that really got me thinking, is it even possible to actually randomly choose a number?  I can't think of a method or model that is truly random.  That is to say, with the same set of inputs (seed) you will always get the same number out.  Even if you asked a human to pick a random number out of a hat, most of them have some cognitive bias.  You might also argue that if you went back in time, and asked them to pick a number, the same neurons would fire they would pick the same number.\n\nSo if it is argued that prime numbers are not random, because they are determined by some deterministic rule/formula, what IS an example of a random number?\n\nIf you argue that say you choose a random number from a distribution, HOW could it be possible to randomly choose that number?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/10l2l0z/selfstudying_abstract_algebra_after_not_studying/",
        "text": "So I've recently gotten interested in learning some math again after a long hiatus from the courses I took in school. The subject of abstract algebra in particular fascinates me, and I've read about how things like groups, rings and fields are elegant objects that generalize a lot of concepts and form the foundation for a lot of higher mathematics. \n\nMy long-term goal is to be able to gain a solid and thorough understanding of the concepts covered in a book such as the one by Dummit and Foote (which I've heard seems to be the classical text on abstract algebra). I'm not taking a class and I don't have an instructor, so all of my help will have to be from textbooks and online resources.\n\nI know that I won't be able to start a book as advanced as the one above anytime soon, and will have to progress up to it. I started reading the fourth edition of \"Mathematical Proofs: A Transition to Advanced Mathematics\" by Chartrand, Polimeni and Zhang so I can first get comfortable writing proofs. I'm still only on the chapter about sets, but I'm finding that it's progressing at the perfect pace and right difficulty level for me so far. I've done the exercises in the first few sections and have gotten most of the answers correct.  \n\nHowever, since it's been so long since I've taken a math course, I'm worried that I may have forgotten some of my previous math knowledge and may eventually hit a barrier the further I go. I took courses in Calculus I and Linear Algebra, and did well in both of them, but they were many years ago. The Calculus course covered differentiation and its applications, but not integration or functions with several variables. The Linear Algebra course was mainly about matrices and vector spaces. It's been a while since I've seen the concepts from these courses. Even in Pre-Calculus, I'm finding that I can't remember off hand how to simplify a rational expression or find a trigonometric function. Hopefully, when I get reacquainted with these things, they should quickly come back to me.\n\nSo I ask: Do you think it's a good idea that I continue with the book that I'm reading about proofs, and just refer back to notes in Calculus and Linear Algebra once I stumble upon them as I go? Or do you think I should start back at the beginning and relearn everything? How well do I have to be in these two subjects to be able to get a good grasp of Abstract Algebra? Would learning the concepts in Calculus II and III and in more advanced Linear Algebra be necessary? \n\nAfter the book I'm reading (which, by the way, has two chapters introducing groups and rings) I thought I might be able to progress into a proper text about Abstract Algebra, like the one by Fraleigh (I've quickly skimmed through it and it seems to have a much more gentle introduction than the one by Dummit and Foote). Do you think this is a good choice? Any other books, resources or tips do you think I should be made aware of?\n\nThanks so much.",
