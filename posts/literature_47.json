        "text": "Has anyone here read William Shakespeare's late romance *The Winter's Tale*? I've been reading it and for me it's one of the most beautiful plays, one of the most difficult works of art that Shakespeare has created. I see Shakespeare doing a lot of new things, mixing tragedy and romance, showing us an almost causeless sexual jealousy in the character of Leontes (Harold Bloom calls him an Othello who is his own Iago), who seems to me one of the most psychologically fascinating of Shakespeare's characters.\n\nHere's a great passage spoken by Leontes:\n\n&gt;Is whispering nothing?        \n&gt;Is leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses?   \n&gt;Kissing with inside lip? stopping the career   \n&gt;Of laughing with a sigh?—a note infallible   \n&gt;Of breaking honesty—horsing foot on foot?   \n&gt;Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?   \n&gt;Hours, minutes? noon, midnight? and all eyes   \n&gt;Blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,   \n&gt;That would unseen be wicked? is this nothing?    \n&gt;Why, then the world and all that's in't is nothing;   \n&gt;The covering sky is nothing; Bohemia nothing;   \n&gt;My wife is nothing; nor nothing have these nothings,   \n&gt;If this be nothing.   \n\nAnd of course one of my favorite, one of the most shocking images ever created by Shakespeare:\n\n&gt;There may be in the cup           \n&gt;A spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart,   \n&gt;And yet partake no venom, for his knowledge     \n&gt;Is not infected: but if one present   \n&gt;The abhorr'd ingredient to his eye, make known   \n&gt;How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,   \n&gt;With violent hefts. I have drunk, and seen the spider.      \n ",

Additionally, Portia and Nerissa are virtually heroines. \n\nAnd on the issue of cross dressing, none of the men are able to distinguish that the \"men\" are actually women, which seems to indicate that Shakespeare is enforcing the notion that only biology seperate's a man and woman.\n\nJessica seems to be a spanner in the works, with how she treats her father however. But I think this can be reconciled when we view her under a more favourable light. A.) She isn't permitted to marry the man she loves, a grave violation of her autonomy. And B.) Although she does steal from her father, she describes life with him as \"hell\", perhaps we can her thievery as a form of reimbursment. Although, I feel I might be going a bit too far here, and could just be trying to accomodate a feminist reading. \n\nWhat're your thoughts? ",

They both admire and envy each other, to point of mental illness in Andreas' case. Andreas is an supreme egotist masquerading as an activist who then kills himself. Then, meandering in the void of 'why?', Pip picks up tennis. \n\nJonathan is Tom. David is Andreas. This sound so much to me like Franzen and Wallace's relationship. It's well documented how insecure DFW was--it's easy to picture him approaching their friendship like Andreas does. And then Franzen wrote that piece in the New Yorker following DFW's suicide, essentially calling it selfish. Although, Purity, to me, seems like a maturation of that view point. Franzen seems to accept now that there is no good reason--it's just an act that can never be fully understood. Lastly, DFW wrote often about tennis (if you had to summarize IJ in one word, tell me it wouldn't be 'tennis') and he played tennis competitively--so after everything that transpired for Pip to play tennis, of all things, I really felt like I was being hit on the head with this.\n\nJonny, baby, if you're reading this, and I'm right shoot me a DM plz\n\nedit: I'm going to crosspost to r/birding so he sees it",

        "text": "Wow, what a book! Krasznahorkai goes from strength to strength or, rather, finds his best form again after what I thought was a dip with *The Last Wolf*. Like *Seiobo There Below*, his new book consists of short chapters connected by common themes. Unlike the earlier book, which had a strong sense of being an episodic novel with narrative drive and development throughout (albeit spiralling in on itself rather than moving forward in a linear way), *TWGO* seems to me on first reading like a collection of stories, although the connecting themes are as strong as before. This might be because some chapters aren't really narratives at all but short abstract pieces drawing us into his nihilistic philosophy and his irresistible view of the precarious tragedy of the human condition (the most gripping articulation of this is in his little collaborative book *Animalinside*). Then in the next chapter he'll be back to storytelling and the familiar self-deprecating dry humour  -- he's once again as funny and heart breaking as Buster Keaton in a play by Beckett. The chapter form makes it a less forbidding prospect than the single sentence \"rivers of black ink\" of his earlier books at any rate.\n\nSeveral chapters reflect on things he has written before, such as when he returns to Nietszche's final revelation and the beaten horse, subject of his screenplay for Tarr's film *The Turin Horse*. It's also true of the centrepiece ~~title~~ story *The Universal Theseus*, which must be one of the best things he has written -- a (properly) Kafkaesque tale told in the first person present in which a man has been summoned, out of the blue, to give a series of lectures. He has no idea why he has been asked to do it, what the audience want from him, or on what subject he should speak. A good half of each lecture is given over to explaining why he's not the man for the job, the least suitable person imaginable in fact. This is K. speaking drily about his vocation as a writer of difficult, futile books that are lost on their audience (they certainly connect with me but you can't help believing he sincerely thinks that, at this stage). What with his preoccupation with Nietszche's \"Mutter, Ich bin dumm\" and his mate Tarr's retirement from film, this story has me seriously worried that he might stop writing. When Tarr announced his retirement I was really disappointed but then I saw the film and thought \"well, you've said the lot there. If you really feel that way, and you clearly do, then I don't blame you for not making any more.\" This story has the same valedictory feel, but who knows. Maybe making so much of the futility of speaking is more of his ironic, paradoxical philosophy.   (EDIT apparently this story was written decades ago, so I'd say it's panic over :))\n\nIn the thread about this book coming out someone mentioned the quote from Sontag comparing him to Gogol and Melville that his publishers never leave off the jacket, questioning how meaningful it is -- I think both comparisons shed some light on his strengths. ~~Maybe the comparison with Gogol is based on the similarities between *Satantango* (it must have been that book Sontag was talking about) and *Dead Souls*, both pessimistic and resigned farces set amongst the serfs.~~(Corrected on this by u/Apfelwurmloch, see below!) A stylistic comparison with Melville is in order too, in the relentless OCD *Grosse Fuge* pursuit of ideas where you don't know if he's determined to weave them into new sense or unravel them til no sense is left. \n\nLooking forward to hearing what you think.\n\n[I've made this a spoiler because I was so surprised and delighted when it dawned on me that the lectures in the title story revisit crucial moments in *The Melancholy of Resistance*, *War and War* and (I think, I need to read it again, but I think the incident in the Post Office comes from there) *Satantango* in the three lectures on Melancholy, Revolt and Possessions. He explains why he told them inadequately first time round, failing to focus on the essence of the matter. After the second lecture he is held in (comfortable) captivity by the men who summoned him, and after the third taken back there presumably never to be heard from again. It really has the feeling of Three Last Words](/spoiler).",

        "text": "I am not sure if this is the correct forum for my question, so I deeply apologize if this is irregular.   In regards to this written verse:\n\n**.*I want to unfold.*.**\n\n**.*I don’t want to be folded anywhere*,**\n\n**.*because where I am folded*,**\n\n**.*there I am a lie.*.**\n\n-R.M.Rilke\n\nLately, I keep going back to this poem because when seeing the word ‘fold’ I see its Spanish equivalent, *doblar*.  And this literally translates to ‘double’.   \n\nSo, I’m wondering if this verse has anything to do with a confrontation of sorts. Specifically between our own dual nature.  Being ‘folded’ to me sounds like being enslaved or trapped within a self-imposed prison. Like being forced to live a lie, but because of fear. \n\n**Does  anyone have any insight on this author’s intended meaning?**\n\nThe thing that comes to mind (for me) is the traditional dance named *El Paso Doble* or in the ballet (French language), *pas de deux*.  This well known piece of choreography depicts two dueling personas that climax by finally forming *something new*.  A transformation of sorts.  The uniting of opposites creates a new pose or style but only after intense passionate struggle, then finally submission.  \n\nMy thoughts are that it is about facing our ‘darkside’, rather a side to our soul that must be confronted, forgiven and accepted. **First there is a fight, then a reconciliation, and finally complete and total surrender (unfolding)**. A way I suppose of accepting change. Only first we have to actually ‘let go’ of our tightly held beliefs?   Or rigid ‘position’?\n\nRilke’s words echo my own profound longing towards a way for Divine Union. \n\n\nMakes me wonder  if this DREAM/DESIRE  of what the mystics refer to as *differentiated union* is even possible.  The type of union that wouldn’t  necessarily eliminate one side or the other - but could maintain both natures intact.   *Creating* a completely new expression of existence with a simple act of trust or blind faith. \n\nDo you think this is what the words mean?    Thank you for any insight. ",
