I've seen athletes faces after they win and lose- it legitimately effects their happiness whether or not they go through the whole season losing or winning.\n\nPoliticians trade principles they claim to care about and potentially endanger their own re-election chances for trivial amounts of money compared to their current net worth.\n\nHell, Scaramucci missed the birth of his own daughter (and eventually cost him his marriage though he didn't know it at the time) so he could put in longer hours for someone he didn't even like or believe in because it was a good opportunity for his career and his name.\n\nAll of done when they're already millionaires many times over.   What's the point?  They're not even gonna get a chance to spend all the money; so many (even modestly) wealthy people die with  large bequests that they never spent or enjoyed.  They just go through all the pain, stress, energy and lost time of earning it.  And at the end of the day they basically did most of that work for free cause they only got to spend 20%.  It seems like such an idiotic way to live your life.\n\nI get that some people enjoy their jobs.  I enjoy mine.  I don't enjoy it at the expense of all other values and aspects of life though.  \n\nWhy do people do this?",

        "text": "A simple example is in renting cars.  I discovered this just recently.  If they want, it seems the companies can and do come up with SOME REASON to charge extra money, even if the car is returned with no troubles.  Moreover, the baseline idea of charging for scratches itself is a junk fee, because a) they clearly don't fix the scratches (judging from the high number on the rented cars), and b) respraying quarter panels doesn't cost what they charge (and much less if you're getting it done wholesale).\n\nOr, of course, banks.  These are the businesses that practically invented the concept of junk fees.  Where the government doesn't twist their arm, they find some way to extract every bit they can through any avenue possible, often deceptively.\n\nAnother good example is people using shame (often adjunct to virtue signaling) as a method of socially acceptable bullying.  I've seen it a lot in the circles I hang out in.  Because my liberal values coincide with most of the shame-mongerer's, I am seldom the target, but I still find it to be really backhanded.\n\nALL of these type of examples are the kind of thing that in less litigious places could easily incur someone getting punched in the face, or worse.  And in these cases, I think the actors usually know they are doing something manipulative, abusive, or duplicitous, but they also know they can \"get away with it.\"  The prospect of a well-deserved broken nose would likely make these bad actors a bit more reticent to ply their scams and play their games.\n\nBut, our system protects socially acceptable bullies and thieves, and leaves little recourse for the law-abiding in these cases.  It seems like a haven for clever sociopaths and narcissists.\n\nWhat's the correct response to this problem?",

As well as with the greeks. \n\nI do know that morals are all relative to culture, and the fact that we find this abhorrent is due to the fact that our cultural morals find this abhorrent, but there is no absoluteness in morality. However, how come that the (ab)usage of young boys have actually been this prevalent;\n\n- Is pedophilia actually so much more prevalent where it is normal to have a young boy in these societies? Where in the west a pedophile is a statistical outlier, it seems weirdly normal that it was known as a word; \"bacha\", \"puellus\". And something perpetrated by seemingly all notable afghan ranks. \n\n- Why specifically always boys? These cultures seem to leave girls (relatively) unharmed. The concept of \"pretty boy\" is especially effeminate, insofar that female words are used like \"beautiful\" and even makekup applied (kohl). And in latin it was the male-ification of the word \"puella\" for girl. The word for boy without sexual pretty connotations would be \"puer\".  \nIf one would actually be looking for  \"girliness\", then why are boys used?",

Talking about people that just want to do evil or torture people because they enjoy it, most of the people that are like this has some mental illness but when that is not the case, should they really be in jail or prison with people that want to do the same or worse than them? These kind of people on my opinion should be isolated from society and any kind of human contact whatsoever. If these kind of people are in prison they live isolated from a normal society, however, they live within a sub-society, a community that accepts what they had done.\n\nThen, people that feel guilt after doing something evil or commiting a crime, people that regret what they had done. Shouldn't those be forgiven? Those who truly regret what they had done; or should they be thrown in prison?  Of course, people are judged and decided then how many years they will spend outside a normal society, which is how society handles any crime that indicates they should go to prison. However, people that do evil just because they want to should be isolated from society so they cant freely inflict pain on others. While those that still want to enjoy freedom and live a normal life should be in prison with other people just like them.\n\nAs I said above, this is just my opinion, meaning, that someone already though of this, someone may be thinking about this and someone will think about this. This indicates that my opinion, may be right or can be alligned to people but also be neglected, which is the whole purpose of the post: know what people think about this particular subject.",

That does NOT mean that I'm interested in these examples, I'm just curious about how this can be generally reflected for future debates and conversations.      \n   \n**Are these examples, 1) Calling out hypocrisy, or 2) Whataboutism?**\n\nex) 1) Israeli Jews push forward to recognize of their struggles against Nazi Germany during World War II, the Muslims react by pointing to the systematic oppression and Ghettos of Palestine.      \n\n2) Americans criticize China for their annexation and systematic oppression of Tibet and its culture. The Chinese react by pointing to the imperialistic and systematic oppression of Hawaii, the people and its history.       \n\n3) Westerners, and animal activists criticize Koreans for eating dog meat. Koreans react that the criticism itself is cultural imperialism, and since Westerners eat pigs (that are more intelligent than dogs) without remorse, they are the ones that are hypocritical.       \n\n4) Liverpool fans (soccer) unite and vehemently support and comemmorate the countless victims who lost their lives in the 1989 Hillsborough stadium. Juventus fans (and several other English club fans) point out that Liverpool, the club and its fans do not acknowledge enough about the crime in Heysel.        \n\n5) Koreans, the society and its people, frequently discuss and criticize the war crimes and the comfort women issue related to Japan, and criticize Japan for its constant \"empty apologies\" and lack of awareness. Japan and its people point out to the Koreans about the war crimes of Koreans in the Vietnam war, and points out the Koreans' hypocrisy of not acknowledging their war crimes enough.        \n\n6) Americans (and other westerners) criticize China for its totalitarian society, lack of human rights and lack of democracy. The Chinese point out that Donald Trump being elected, and brexit, shows that democracy is an unstable system that is not mandatory for all nations. They also point out about America's NSA, and Edward Snowden.        \n\n7) Muslims living in the West, suffering from extreme forms of racism and hate speech, calls for the government to regulate (or prohibit) hate speech towards them, and promote a more tolerant atmosphere. Other Westerners (mainly Christians and Jews) point out to how the Islamic countries in the Middle East treat the religious minorities, and says that the Muslims should be thankful for living in a more tolerant society without calling out racism all the time.          \n\n8) Citizens living in cities suffering from sky high housing prices (Vancouver and Sydney comes to mind) blame the greedy Chinese for inflating their housing market. Some use this as justification for being racist against East Asians in general. The Chinese (mainly immigrants) react by pointing out that the local westerners had no qualms with Europeans buying their houses, the British buying and inflating houses in Spain, or Americans buying houses en large in Mexico and Brazil, inflating the local housing and driving out the locals systematically. They also argue that the housing issue is another excuse to express their \"Yellow Scare\".      \n\n9) Right leaning Redditors who are against political correctness in general, or have a problem against the \"social justice warriors\", mock the socially aware left-leaning people by saying they are easily offended, \"snowflakes\" and \"being triggered\". Left leaning people point out that the right leaning people are the ones who are truly being offended all the time and \"triggered\", by pointing out right leaning people being \"snowflakes\" every time criticism against right-wing issues come up (these days mainly related to Donald Trump), or liberal values come up, such as multiculturalism, actions against hate speech, calling out racist incidents etc.     \n\n\n**My opinions are: 1) Calling out hypocrisy 2) Whataboutism 3) Calling out hypocrisy 4) Whataboutism 5) Whataboutism 6) Whataboutism 7) Whataboutism 8) Calling out hypocrisy, 9) Calling out hypocrisy.**         \n\nThe only issue that I have now....is *that I'm not confident in defending these answers.* Opinions generally differ so much from people to people, the interpretations of a social issue are so different. And many boil down to whether a side is using hypocrisy, or whataboutism. Where do you draw the line? Not only just those question examples above, but how can I learn from it for future debates and conversations?",

Seeing him trying to do everything as quickly as possible is a bit ridicilous, but it got me wondering; what scientifically backed ways are there to increase your lifespan?\n\n* What should your diet look like?\n\n* What supplements, if any, should you take?\n\n* What lifestyle habits should you form and which ones should you stay away from?\n\nI'm not talking about habits that indirectly cause longer lives either. E.g. married people are happier on average, thus marriage causes you to live longer. ",

If we are required to participate in the ACA, so should there be requirements for the Insurance companies.  \n\nInsurers that offer nothing on the ACA exchange pay a stated fine for every month that year they have no plans. (This could be written as just an annual, not monthly fine too, I suppose)\n\nInsurers that offer the bare minimum are neutral, no fines -- no gains.\n\nThe better your plan offered, in terms of coverage, price, availability, the better the service you are doing for the US citizen and the government in terms of financial assistance.  For this effort you get tax credits.\n\nOffer multiple, amazing plans that save everybody money?   Ring up your credits!\n\nAny money paid in fines helps the poorest cover coverage and services.\n\nAside from the fact that our government would never fine Pharma or Medical, is there any other flaws with this idea?\n",
