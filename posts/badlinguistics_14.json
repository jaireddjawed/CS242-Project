Report it.\n\n2) Am I upset about the mystical SJWs or 'tumblr' or some other sort of progressive movement that violates my ~right to be an asshole~? DON'T REPORT IT.\n\n***and don't use slurs in the reports come on people what the hell is wrong with you***\n\nedit:\n\n[i, naturally, turned on 'ignore reports' for this post](http://i.imgur.com/hmDlTmX.png). y'all scrubs, GIT GUD.",

This post is quite /r/badhistory as well.\n\nAnyway, my teacher would always tell us about the English language having difficult and confusing spelling, and I agree it can be confusing at times, but she had an explanation; Charlemagne. Apparently, the English king Charlemagne was illiterate until he was an adult, and after he learned to read, he wanted to make sure he was the only one that could read and write, so he single-handedly changed the spelling of English to make it purposely more difficult for people to learn.\n\nShe was my teacher for 2 years, and would frequently have tirades cursing Charlemagne for ruining English. \n\nR4 in comments.",

I'm getting an MA in applied linguistics and we had a discussion that was originally about some PhD philosophy dissertation one of us found.  \n\nIt basically devolved into me defending linguistics as a science, Psy's case for why it wasn't a science seemed to be rooted in that I was getting an MA and not an MS while Anthro didn't like that we used qualitative data as well as quantitative, depending on the study.  Called qualitative data \"spin\".  Nevermind that antrhopology uses qualitative data now and then.\n\nI tried to explain a psycholinguistics study in which I was a participant.  I sat in a room with a computer and the computer showed me two images (like a boy pushing a girl on one side and a girl pushing a boy on the other, similar but not quite the same).  I would hear an audio of a sentence and I had to mouse over the image I *thought* the sentence was gonna be before the sentence finished.  The study used NES and NNES participants to see if there was a difference in reaction time, and it focused mainly on active vs passive sentences.  \n\nBoth, particularly Psy, thought that the study was \"more of a cultural study rather than anything psychological\" because (this is approximately Psy's words) \"you process your schema through your first language, which is very cultural\".  I kind of knew what he meant but I found it very frustrating.  I tried to explain that a Spanish speaker might process a sentence more closely to a NES than a Korean speaker because the grammars are much more similar than the latter, but that has practically nothing to do with culture.  Not to mention, when an NNES began learning English might have an impact and this study was trying to find that out.  \n\nAnthro meanwhile just focused on the use of qualitative data and saw no value in it at all, only quantitative was worth anything publishable in his eyes.  Nevermind the study I just used as an example was *entirely* quantitative. \n\nI gave up after a while because after about 40 minutes it was apparent that the two were not about to change their minds.  Maybe I didn't explain my case well, but it's been bugging me every since and I had to get it off my chest.  \n\n",

        "text": "Bad linguistics from [His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales](http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/media/speeches/speech-hrh-the-prince-of-wales-the-royal-mail-500th-anniversary-reception), no less:\n\n&gt; In these days of texting and various social media \"apps\", the well-constructed sentence is under mortal threat!  As someone who relies on the well-aimed letter - and relishes the ones in return! -  I can only say how strongly I feel that the logical ordering of thoughts in proper, grammatically correct prose is in fact rather important at the end of the day.\n\nReason this is bad linguistics:  there is no evidence that \"the well-constructed sentence\" is under mortal threat from texting and social media.  Furthermore, it is not hard to find dubiously-constructed sentences in the text of the technophobic Prince's speech itself.",
