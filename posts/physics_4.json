If light has a speed limit what is is relative to? If I was in a car going 670,615,029 mph (speed of light - slightly less than normal bullet speed) in a perfect vacuum and used a gun in the same direction the car was going why can’t the bullet go faster than light because it would be a normal speed relative to the car?

        "text": "First off, I apologize if this is the wrong place to pose this question. If so, I will take recommendations on where else to post, and kindly delete this and post elsewhere. \n\nWhile the magic system in my world does break some laws of physics, this is quite rare. The basis of most “magic” lies within the laws of thermodynamics. \n\nThe magical art itself is called the Transfer. It generally states that a being can pull energy into their body from an external source, and transform it into another type. For instance, someone who uses the Transfer may pull solar energy or sound energy from their environment and convert it to something else to give them the edge in battle, such as heat, electromagnetic, or kinetic energy. The practical uses for this are entirely wide ranging. \n\nThe are two main areas where I am struggling to make this system make sense:\n\n1. I believe energy varies in potency in its various forms, no? For instance, it might take a large amount of solar energy to Transfer a desired amount of sound energy, whereas electromagnetic energy may take far less to get the same outcome. Am I correct in this assumption? If so, what are some resources I can look into to learn about this in more detail?\n\n2. While everyone can use the Transfer, no two users are created equally. When energy is Transferred, a certain percentage is lost (not destroyed) into both unintended forms (called the Lesser Bleed) and a fictional energy vacuum (called the Greater Bleed). One user might be able to Transfer energy while keeping 80% of it for the desired outcome, losing the remaining 20% in either lesser or greater Bleed. A more unfortunate individual may only be able to Transfer at a rate of 50%. This has additional impacts on the world as in this universe, energy may be converted into a fictional “life energy”, healing the user and reversing the effects of age. There are a very rare few who Transfer at a rate of over 100%, breaking the laws of thermodynamics and “creating energy”. They are known as Hallowed. \nAre there any possible holes I could dig myself with the concepts of the Bleed and the Hallowed? I’m guessing I could run into a lot of plot related problems without a clear understanding of the implications here. \n\nFor those of you who took the time to read this, thank you. I do light reading on the sciences for fun, but if I’m honest, I really don’t know much at all about physics. Anyone who helps me in this journey is greatly appreciated",

        "text": "Hello all,\n\nCurrently working on springs and spring energy. We just did a lab graphing springs to find that energy is area under the curve. The springs were \"tightly wound\", so that it needed some initial amount of mass before stretching, such as shown [here](https://imgur.com/a/U3iqxqg).\n\nOne of the parts had students trying to calculate the work from the spring constant they found on the graph using (.5)kx^2. This didn't match up on their graph, since there was the extra part on the bottom. I'll just make them \"0\" the graph at the initial force next year.\n\nHowever, I'm interested in how I would solve this without a graph. So, like, in the attached problem ([here again)](https://imgur.com/a/U3iqxqg), if one was told that the spring (k=200N/m) didn't start stretching until 10 N, how one would find the energy of the spring after stretching it 5 cm. I feel like it has to do something with the force and the distance (like shown in the graph, but I don't know how I'd justify that without the graph. Maybe I'm just having a lapse in thinking though.\n\nThanks for any help!",

        "text": "So for the most part whenever I look into criticism of the model, I see more criticism of his character rather than the work itself, but I came across this comment regarding the model in an earlier Reddit post and I’d like to know what physicists think of it:\n\nMany folks (especially here) don't understand the wolfram physics model and as you can tell many people here are more interested in attacking his character or saying \"it doesn't make experiments or predictions\" which is flat out false.\n\nNKS starts out by literally doing experiments... experiments that are strong in terms of proof of the following type: running possible scenarios. You can imagine that if you had a question such as \"what is the shortest path to get to school?\" Wolframs style of experiment was just posing \"what if you just calculated all possible paths you could take to school.\"\n\nThese kinds of experiments therefor generate hard proofs about the behavior of these systems. He analyzed there behavior, and that analysis led to statements about the nature of the rule class itself, and then more broadly to behavior of rules in general as he analyzed more of them.\n\nThe conclusions that came from those experiments is that there is a pervasive universality to these classes of rules. In some rules of the same class you get homogenous, or rather boring behavior, in other rules of the same class you get maximally complex and Turing universal behavior. He also found that these rules can all emulate each other when fed the right initial conditions...\n\nTo actually explain how that is even possible is the purpose of his principle: the principle of computational equivalence made at the end of his book, which is the notion that mostly all systems are Turing universal and are therefor equivalent in sophistication.\n\nThe above statement has incredible impact on well...just about everything…..the most important impact this statement has is that it implies some kind of isomorphism symmetry to the space of all systems that exist. That symmetry is actually the not so obvious statement that the universe is computationally equivalent to a Turing machine, and that Turing machines are equivalent to one another…meaning that practically all systems are capable of computing all computable functions and that includes the universe itself.\n\nThe cherry on top in addition to the above implications, is that you can get a Turing universal system (a system that's arbitrarily complicated) with both a simple initial condition AND simple rules... meaning that for practically nothing at all...you can compute anything.\n\nTherefor it becomes plausible to state that you can create a universe running practically any rule... and then you could ask why would it be running just one rule and not all possible rules? And this is where his ideas about the Ruliad construct comes from.\n\nFrom this information you can further device a proof that it must be true: if you can run rule 30 in our universe then the universe isn't only running \"the fundamental rule\" it's running both this rule 30 and that fundamental rule...so for any rule that you can run, you can further conclude that the universe is running all possible rules and must take the form of this Ruliad object.\n\nThe above proof is intuitive if people just understood how emergence works... if you are running some simple program and it's performing\nTuring universal computation, then it has the capacity at any scale of this system to produce some other arbitrary system of rules.\n\nThe above is the precursor information needed in order to understand why the physics model is made in the way that it is...it is simple atoms of space undergoing rewrite operations and from that emerges the laws of physics as we observe them.\n\nWhy these laws of physics and not something else?\nEvolutionary Selection..\n\nGo and run a conways game of life and coarse grain it. The simple rule you could be running down at the first level coarse grains into some generic physics at the coarse grained level. The automatons that\n\"survived\" or continues to move on the fine grained level is the emergent physics you get to see on the coarse grained level…. where the automatons that don't move down there are the ones that died and don't get to be seen on the coarse grained level.\n\nIn other words the universe Is running all possible physics...most of it disappears as soon as it arrives, and settles into statistically average behavior, and this is what we get to see...and this process of what stays and what doesn't continues all the way up to our scale.\n\nWolframs physics model is therefor consistent with evolution…try and get any current physics theory to be consistent with evolution... (fine tuning and naturalness problem says hello) the only way they can is through anthropic principle and multiverse theories.\n\nAnyway, hope this was enough background on why the physics model is true...if that's not enough though his science actually has applicability in the world (you can model things with the wolfram model) which I've done and I do it for my own purposes. They've been rather successful in that regard and that itself is enough proof for me in what 1 need to believe in and who's side to take. Don't care about his character.",

        "text": "Hello! Sorry if this is long or silly.\n\nThis is a question which I often wonder about. A bit of background before I go into the question. I am a 1st Year Master’s Student in Physics and I have done well in Academics throughout my Bachelors and before that as well. Moved to a new country last year to study Physics at a good university as well.\n\nSo to my situation now. There are times when I feel, I have mostly only done what I needed to do for my course/to get decent grades. Since the last 2 years, I have not read any Physics books the traditional way. All my reading/learning were done using the internet/lecture notes and a few book chapters/research papers here and there. I am not happy about this. I feel that if I start reading a book, I will get too engrossed in it and stray away from my coursework and my grades will be affected. \n\nSo this is the recurring question to myself and now to you, fellow physicists and/or physics enthusiasts. Have I “done” Physics the right way? Or have I wasted the last 1-2 years of my life by not reading any books. I want to be a good physicist and do justice to it. Am I just overthinking ?\n\nPS : I have already decided that I want to read more books, so please drop your book suggestions. I still want to hear a neutral opinion about my situation here though :)",
