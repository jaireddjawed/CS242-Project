I read the rules and it doesnt seem to violate them. \n\nIn anycase, as the title suggests, I am looking for suggestions on physics related topics to simulate and or analyze using Python. For context, I have had a NVIDIA 3060 graphics card for a while and would like to put to use analyzing simulation data or producing them to gain a better understanding of physics.\n\nI know physocs is a vast field, and so would like suggestions or tips for doing this. I would preferably like to do this in Python, as I have been reading into PySINDY, but I am willing to learn other languages.\n\nI suppose this could also serve as a post where people share ideas or papers on the subject. Thanks.",

Think about Newton, Pascal, Joule, Einstein, Coulomb, Rutherford, ... all the famous ones. (Faraday is sadly missing)  \nHowever, there is still room for more, and right now there is not a single poster about a woman. Of course. I'm going to give Marie Curie the honour she deserves, but I'm looking for more ideas about who I could hang up on the wall.   \n\n\nThe sole criterium is that it has to be about something somewhat tangible for high school students (so no stuff like gluon interactions or christoffel symbols, if you get what I mean)  \n\n\nThanks for the help and suggestions!",

When I was a jonior in highschool I had a personal family emergency that resulted in my missing about a month of school. This was 2017, so my math class was Pre-Calc. I missed the introduction of Trigonometry, and by the time I rejoined the class they were using Œ∏ and I, of course, didn't even know where to begin catching up. \nFor reasons relating to that family emergency, I dropped out of highschool early the following year after failing that Pre-Calc and, being told I could catch up by doing another year at that school. \nI now find myself deeply interested in physics, I want to soon go to college, but that isn't something that is accessible to me in my current life position. (context: basically living on my own, and without support. Making just barely enough to cover rent and food.) \nI really appreciate the person who leaves their Google drive in each weekly textbook prompt. Unfortunately I lack the foundation to make any real headway with anything in it. \n\nDoes anybody have textbooks in PDF. that could help me take myself from Trigonometry through to Differential Equations? \nI keep thinking to myself that if I can get a mental grasp on Calc, then I will be able to better digest the books I'm really interested in studying. \n\n\nI know that was a lot, thank you!! \n\n\nTL;DR:  Any Highschool level math textbook PDF.s and also Freshman level?",

        "text": "Recently found an essay ([\"The Anomaly of a Woman in Physics\"](https://stsinfrastructures.org/sites/default/files/artifacts/media/pdf/keller_anomaly_1977.pdf)) by Evelyn Fox Keller on her experience in the Harvard Physics department in the late 1950s. Keller is typically seen as a sociologist or historian of science (she wrote *A Feeling for the Organism,* a biography on Barbara McClintock the discoverer of transposons), but she had science experiences of her own. \n\nQuote from essay on how foundational questions were undervalued in comparison to more calculation-oriented investigated\n\n&gt;I went to graduate school with a vision of theoretical physics as a vehicle for the deepest inquiry into nature‚Äîa vision perhaps best personified, in recent times, by Einstein. The use of mathematics to further one‚Äôs understanding of the nature of space, time, and matter represented a pinnacle of human endeavor. I went to graduate school to learn about foundations. I was taught, instead, how to do physics. In place of wisdom, I was offered skills. Furthermore, this substitution was made with moralistic fervor. It was wrong, foolhardy, indeed foolish, to squander precious time asking why. Proper humility was to bend to the grindstone and learn techniques. Contemporary physics, under the sway of operationalism, had, it seemed, dispensed with the tradition of Einstein‚Äîalmost, indeed, with Einstein himself. General relativity, the most intellectually ambitious venture of the century, seemed then (wrongly) a dead subject. Philosophical considerations of any sort in the physical sciences were at an all-time low. Instead, techniques designed to calculate nth-order corrections to a theory grievously flawed at its base were the order of the day.\n\nand on calculation mistakes, deeper questions, and humility\n\n&gt;I needed to be humbled. Though I writhed over the banality of the assignments I was given, I did them, acknowledging that I needed in any case to learn the skills. I made frequent arithmetic errors‚Äîreflecting a tension that endures within me even today between the expansiveness of conception and the precision of execution, my personal variation perhaps of the more general polar tension in physics as a whole. When my papers were returned with the accuracy of the conception ignored and the arithmetic errors streaked with red‚Äîas if with a vengeance‚ÄîI wondered whether I was studying physics or plumbing. Who has not experienced such a wrenching conflict between idealism and reality? Yet my fellow students seemed oddly untroubled. From the nature of their responses when I tried to press them for deeper understanding of the subject, I thought perhaps I had come from Mars. Why, they wondered, did I want to know? That they were evidently content with the operational success of the formulas mystified me. Even more mystifying was the absence of any appearance of the humility of demeanor that one would expect to accompany the acceptance of more limited goals. I didn‚Äôt fully understand then that in addition to the techniques of physics, they were also studying the techniques of arrogance. This peculiar inversion in the meaning of humility was simply part of the process of learning how to be a physicist. It was intrinsic to the professionalization, and what I might even call the masculinization, of an intellectual discipline.\n\nEntire essay is quite interesting and would likely resonate with many who have studied theoretical physics.",

Would it look roughly the same, thus making sort of a mound of strength &lt; 100V around the object or would all these layers kind of take shape of an object*? Also would object protrude distortion far upwards, (almost not changing distance between 100V and 200V layers) or would it cramp layers, thus making rapid growth in charge a small distance from the top of that object? Or first image is wrong, and field remains mostly unchanged except for a very tiny gap around the object? Is there a formula describing how actually this happends?\n\nI've already asked it on PhysicsStackExchange (no answer yet), so don't be surprised if you see it there.\n\n*I know these aren't layers, but a gradual growth, I use word \"layer\" for simplicity.",

If you fired a 44 caliber handgun at someone it would blow a hole in them just like here on earth.  The inertia of the slug would do the damage in this gravity free situation.  For that matter when you fire a bullet on earth at a target gravity has little to do with it-in close range of course.  I realize the bullet would fall to earth eventually due to earth's gravity.

        "text": "Hello all! I hope this is the right place to post this.\n\nI'm trying to understand the intuitions behind FFT, in such a way that I should be able to derive it's formula from scratch.\n\nCurrently, I've made great progress on understanding it. The points that I understood pretty well are:\n\n* why are we multiplying `sin(x)` and `f(x)`\n* why are we taking the integral of that product `sin(x) * f(x)`\n\n**A quick summary of those:** FFT can be used in decomposing waves to find its basic components. If two waves correlated, their signs are matching on average (think of them in coordinate system). So we have to find a mathematical way of finding two different function's (wave's) signs are same on average.\n\nBy multiplying two functions, we got their signs multiplied as well. And if the integral of that product is positive, that means, the wave's signs were matching on average. Thus, one of them can be a component of the other.\n\n**My question starts here:**\n\nIn FFT's actual formula, we are not only multiplying `sin(x)` with the wave at hand (`f(x)`). We are multiplying `cos(x) + isin(x)` with `f(x)`.\n\n***Question 1:***\n\nWhy have we added `cos(x)` to `sin(x)`? Why do we need `cos(x)` when decomposing a wave? ChatGPT explained something about it is related to odd/even functions and detecting odd/even frequencies. But the explanations were shallow. I wasn't able to get a satisfying answer.\n\n***Question 2:***\n\nWhy we multiplied `sin(x)` by `i`? I've heard in a video that it is about the phase of the `sin(x)`, and ChatGPT provided a similar answer. But still, I don't get the full intuition behind it.\n\nFinal note: I don't want proofs. There are plenty of them on the internet. I know the formula works, I know `cos(x) + isin(x)` is related to Euler's theorem. I know it's about circles. I've seen the proofs.\n\n***What I want is:*** a logical explanation on the question `why` rather that `how`. I'd appreciate it greatly if someone can provide this :) Spent almost 2 months on this with a friend :')",

        "text": "I have some very rusty high school math and physics knowledge, but have been trying to wrap my head around entropy and energy transfer and how this plays out on the scale of the universe. I understand that sounds a bit overly ambitious and naive ‚Äî but stay with me. \n\nI‚Äôve been trying to visualise a simple model of the universe from a very dense, ordered atomic system to one of maximum entropy. I wanted to account for both the transfer of energy and the expansion of space (which I may be misunderstanding) with the result being an increase to a system of maximum entropy. My question is twofold: does the model below make sense in the most basic conceptual way, and is my intuitive analysis of the probability correct.\n\nI‚Äôd also be open to another visualisation that is equally easy to grasp for someone without much physics or math ‚Äî just a sort of conceptual anchor to visualise the tendency of the universe. Perhaps that‚Äôs a crazy thing to try to do in an afternoon, but surely this has been attempted before by someone more competent. \n\nAnyway. My model:\n\nLet‚Äôs say I define a starting macro-state where a large amount of dots are densely packed together in a 2D grid such that one dot is always in contact with at least two other dots. At the start there is no empty space around this structure ‚Äî just a rigid edge. For simplicity the structure is rectangular ‚Äî a grid of discrete positions with every position occupied. Once the simulation starts, some of the dots will have the ‚Äúenergy‚Äù to move randomly into any available empty space if an empty space exists. If a dot moves adjacent to a dot that can also move, nothing changes. If a dot moves adjacent to a dot that is static, the static dot gains the ability to move and the previously kinetic dot becomes static. Where multiple dots become adjacent the energy transfer is the same ‚Äî only one amount of energy can be transferred an only between two dots at a time. For instance, if two kinetic dots simultaneously become adjacent to a single static dot, one of the kinetic dots gives its energy to the static dot and the another kinetic dot keeps its energy. \n\nI start the simulation and begin to move back the rigid walls on all sides discretely ‚Äî creating a new level of spaces around the original rectangle and thus a larger rectangle. This then triggers the random movement of the initial group of kinetic dots. As the dots move and interact, the walls continue to expand, creating ever more space in which the dots can move and transfer energy.\n\nLet‚Äôs assume this continues for quite a long time ‚Äî say the entire span of the universe from the Big Bang to the end (heat death) Let‚Äôs also assume we have as many dots as atoms. Would the macro-state of this system made of the highest number of micro-states (maximum entropy) ultimately tend to one where any combination of dot position, adjacency and kinetic energy is equally likely? Is this basically modelling heat death?",

        "text": "Here is a thought that comes from the analogy between thermodynamic system and brain, both consisting of many individuals. A thermo system, in the quantum language, has tremendous \"microstates\", and, when in stable condition, the microstates have stable probability distribution. A brain, or a nervous system in general, can have microstates, because each neuron has its most prominent state, firing or not firing, which is binary of course. Then, for example, a tiny brain with three neurons A, B and C, can generate 2X2X2=8 microstates. We can imagine that a brain in the perfectly stable environment can sustain stable firing, and hence keep microstates in stable probability distribution.\n\nNow let's see how neural connections affect the microstates' probability distribution, and how the information concept comes in. Back to the tiny brain above, at first suppose that the brain has all three neurons disconnected without any neural connections. Then we add a neural connection from neuron B to C, and suppose the connection transmits the signal from B to C with probability 0.4. The added neural connection changes the microstates probability distribution, because microstate B, where only neuron B fires, transits to microstate BC, where neuron B and C fires together, with probability 0.4, and likewise microstate AB transits to microstate ABC with probability 0.4. The following diagram depicts the microstate transitions, where transition probabilities are labeled.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n4k0tk2nnwda1.png?width=273&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4c790d25ad05a821254d1db74b6634ec56cfed7a\n\nThe transitions allow us to picture the neural connection as a noisy channel between information source X and destination Y, sending and receiving symbols (i.e. microstates) respectively. Here X represents the brain before adding the neural connection, and Y represents the brain after. We can say, the noisy channel perturbs the original microstates generated by X, and then Y \"receives\" the perturbed ones by actually firing neurons. Therefore, X, neural connection and Y together make the very communication system in the classic information theory, as follows.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9pu0kryonwda1.png?width=845&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8b562d2ff6f6a6439d1a25c4e2b929439b6204c4\n\nWith this communication system, we can talk about entropy, order and chaos, channel capacity, transmission rate, etc., anything we know about information theory. And we can see, any change of neural connections, on one or many, weakened or strengthened, adding or removing ones, only modifies the channel and specifically the microstates transitions. And the channel can go to a stable state under the long-term influence of neurons' firing; this stable state of channel could be a \"memory\" of the stable environment.\n\nWild idea isn't it? It is just irresistible to see all those otherwise remote concepts fit in so nicely (to my knowledge). Anyway, comments are welcome.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/10ju79p/what_is_the_if_any_consensus_of_physicists_in/",
        "text": "This is a summary of what (from my amateur level) looks like bad news for the standard Big Bang model but good news for a Cyclic model ultimately replacing it:\n\n&gt;In the 1920s, theoretical physicists, most notably Albert Einstein, considered the possibility of a cyclic model for the universe as an (everlasting) alternative to the model of an expanding universe. However, work by Richard C. Tolman in 1934 showed that these early attempts failed because of the cyclic problem: according to the Second Law of Thermodynamics, entropy can only increase.\\[1\\] This implies that successive cycles grow longer and larger. Extrapolating back in time, cycles before the present one become shorter and smaller culminating again in a Big Bang and thus not replacing it. This puzzling situation remained for many decades until the early 21st century when the recently discovered dark energy component provided new hope for a consistent cyclic cosmology.\\[2\\] In 2011, a five-year survey of 200,000 galaxies and spanning 7 billion years of cosmic time confirmed that \"dark energy is driving our universe apart at accelerating speeds.\"\\[3\\]\\[4\\]  \n&gt;  \n&gt;One new cyclic model is the brane cosmology model of the creation of the universe, derived from the earlier ekpyrotic model. It was proposed in 2001 by Paul Steinhardt of Princeton University and Neil Turok of Cambridge University. The theory describes a universe exploding into existence not just once, but repeatedly over time.\\[5\\]\\[6\\]  **The theory could potentially explain why a repulsive form of energy known as the cosmological constant, which is accelerating the expansion of the universe, is several orders of magnitude smaller than predicted by the standard Big Bang model.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A different cyclic model relying on the notion of phantom energy was proposed in 2007 by Lauris Baum and Paul Frampton of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\\[7\\]  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Other cyclic models include conformal cyclic cosmology and loop quantum cosmology.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic\\_model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_model)\n\nIs this the antiquation of the standard Big Bang model?",
