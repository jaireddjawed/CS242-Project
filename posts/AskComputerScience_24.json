This user was suggested to get T A I L S or Ubunt, and this user looked up a YT guide how to put T A I L S on a USB and another USB stick and to use that as the harddrive for the laptop and do sensitive browsing on that with T O R built-in, which is cool because that's one less thing to download. This user is a newb at such things aside from going to a frend's house years ago and seeing what DNMarkets and torenting looked like (didn't buy anything just marveled at a world unknown to this user at the time) and never ran anything like that on computers this user owned.

        "text": "Hi people,\n\nI'm a graduate student and soon have to determine in what area I want to do my master thesis in. I've always thought that this would be clear to me when I reached this point in time, but for whatever reason, I have no idea. At my university, the master thesis is a 1 year project, and I really want to be sure to find an area that I will find interesting for the whole year, and not starting to hate it after the first month.\n\nI've talked to different professors at my university, but they were unable to help me with anything but questions directly related to their own research area, and their all told me that if I wanted to do my master thesis in their research area, I could come see them, and we could find a more specific topic.\n\nHence, I'm writing here, because I don't know where else to go, and I hope that someone will be able to give me some inspiration.\n\n**Subjects I like:**\n\nI'm definitely in the pratical/applied part of computer science. I'm looking for an area where I can focus on the code, and less on theory. I don't mind diving deep into low-level code and system architectures, algorithms, data structures and their optimizations is really some of the core subjects I find interesting. Also, I find it quite important that the things I spend my time on have a deeper meaning, and that I'm not just doing it for my own good. It's way more inspirational if someone is actually in need of what you're making.\n\n**Been there, done that**\n\nBecause of that last statement, I've been looking alot at topics like data mining/machine learning and bioinformatics, because that's quite a popular thing at my university. However, at least for bioinformatics, I discovered that the results and the biology was way more important than the tools, and it is perhaps the tools, namely the machine learning algorithmics, I found most interesting.\n\nRecently I completed a course in computer game programming, which was actually not an area I found particularly interesting when I signed up, but looking back, it contained some very interesting parts, especially with regards to game AI. Unfortunately I'm not sure I will be able to find a supervisor for this area, and topics might also be difficult to find.\n\nThere's alot of focus at the _science_ areas at my university's computer science department, i.e. bioinformatics and cheminformatics, however I'm not really sure if that's a direction I want to head in.\n\nAt this point I'm pretty close to just go with something, but I know that I'll have to think more about it if I want to keep myself motivated for a whole year.\n\n**TL;DR:** _I'm not looking for a specific topic_. I'm looking for a _research area_ or _subject_ in computer science, in which I could find a topic. Basically I just want something where I can do a lot of programming, preferably one large project from scratch in a compiled language, with lots of design choices, algorithms, data structures, etc.\n\nI might be putting too much thought into this, but I would really appreciate to hear others opinion, in case there's an area I've missed, or general recommendations with regard to the above.\n\nThanks a lot!",

It didn't work that well though.\n\n\nAnyways, next time, I think I'll do a screen recording of the session.\n\n\nSo here's the question:  Is there a software or app that I could use to restrict remote access? or possibly have it run in the background, where they couldn't see, so that I could quit the session immediately with a shortcut if something came up I didn't want out there, like passwords?\n\n\nThanks a bunch",

I'm not really a comp arch student anymore but I'm still pretty curious. \n\n\nWe were also taught speculative execution right after OOO and tomasulo's in Comp Arch. Then using run ahead execution or SMT for further processing to combat the memory wall. \n\nI feel like this shits on the face of the IPC performance craze of the 1990s, which still is in effect today. All processors these days employ speculative OOO w/ SMT (x86 I mean), and even ARM processors since what the A8 arch from 2008ish have employed SS + OOO + Speculative execution. \n\nWill future designs have to change now? Do processor designers have to change fundamental micro-architecture details? Are there are forms of instruction level parallelism still left to exploit beyond branch prediction or increasing parallelism through wider SS stages or instruction windows since Deep Pipelines already went bust from Pentium IV? Do we increase the number of replay registers for SMT and widen the number of simultaneous threads per physical core instead of the 2 thread implementation both Intel and AMD have done since the Pent IV? \n\nI guess I'm asking how big of an impact does this bug have on instruction level parallelism and will both processor designers, and software developers be forced to rethink their programs to exploit other types of parallelism to gain performance benefits now that not only IPC has stagnated but might regress? Since multicore is difficult, and many core/HPC is its on specialty. I'm guessing Intel and AMD will start marketing their NoC implementations since just saying IPC and cache increases won't fly anymore as improvements, and no one has given a hoot about GHz since 45 stage pipeline days. \n\nOr will it no have any effect at all? Or do we just wait until we have like a bazillion levels of cache, like the L4 cache used in some Haswell processors for non iGPU processors using eDRAM? Do we just wait on memory now? More on die memory dedicated to a more complicated cache hierarchy like 4T on die DRAM? or HBM or a nonvolatile memory accelerator cache disk on the PCIe bus like Optane? ",

        "text": "Hey guys.\n\nI'm in the process of understanding exactly what Martin Fowler's Remote Facade Pattern actually is and how it's used in practice.\n\nLink to Martin Fowler's definition and the address example I'll be using: https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/remoteFacade.html\n\nI understand that the intention of the Remote Facade Pattern is to limit the traffic and the amount of calls made over the network, so instead of calling 3 methods separately over the network to set the address, you should make a Remote Facade that includes a single method to set all the data for the address.\n\nThe problem is that my teacher has given me the impression that a Remote Facade needs to be made on the client and not the server, but if the server only makes available 3 separate methods for setting all the address data and doesn't have a single method that combines the job, then I can make a single method on my client that calls all 3 methods on the server, but that won't result in any less traffic being sent, because 3 methods still have to be invoked over the network.\n\nIs it wrong that the Remote Facade needs to be on the client and not the server or am I missing something?\n\nIn case it makes any difference, in terms of client/server I'm thinking about applications that would require a client and a server to communicate over the network like Socket and Web API.\n\nI would really appreciate if you guys could help me out! Thanks in advance!",

        "text": "I understand most of it I think, but theres a few things Im not getting.\n\n    10\n    (+ 5 3 4)\n    (- 9 1)\n    (/ 6 2)\n    (+ (* 2 4) (- 4 6))\n    (define a 3)\n    (define b (+ a 1))\n    (+ a b (* a b))\n\nThis all makes sense, although I dont understand why it just starts with \"10\", seems to just be an irrelevant piece of code since its not defined or told to do anything and isnt used in any way as far as I can tell. Might as well have written \"Purplemonkeydishwasher\" here!\n\na is defined as 3, b as a+1 and so 4 however then there is:\n\n    (= a b)\n\nThe answer key gives this as #f, but I dont think this has been defined in the book yet. What does #f mean here and how does it relate to the define function?\n\nThe meaning seems to be that a = b and thats what I treated it as, so basically although we just defined a and b, now its saying that a IS b, and so both have a value of 4. This is where I got confused and began getting wrong answers, only continuing to treat a as 3 and b as 4 yielded the right answers. So what is the meaning of this piece of code and what is it doing?\n\n    (if (and (&gt; b a) (&lt; b (* a b)))\n      b\n      a)\n\nI understand most of this. It basically is saying is b &gt; a? The answer is no, and since it is an and statement and the first part of this returns a false value, the rest of the code isnt read. However, I dont understand why both b and a are listed at the bottom? It returns the value 4, but why are both b and a used and not just one or the other? How come if both are used it isn't equal to 8, or 4 and 4? What would happen if this same line of code was written but only with a or b? Would it still return 4? It happens again further down.\n\n    (cond ((= a 4) 6)\n      ((= b 4) (+ 6 7 a))\n      (else 25))\n\nHere is where Im really stuck. I keep getting a value of 17 and not 16. I think where Ive gone wrong is not understanding the (= a b) statement above. Instead of it meaning that a, which is 3, is equal to 4, making a and b both give a value of 4, instead it seems that maybe a still = 3. If it did then that would solve this part of the code because if 3 is = 4 the value 6 is returned, but its not. So the next step is if b = 4, which it is, then the value (+ 6 7 a) is returned, which does indeed equal 16 where a = 3.\n\nDoes this make sense and is this correct that a still = 3? If so, I dont understand where the #f came from or what the actual meaning of the (= a b) statement above is or what this did to the code since I dont think # was discussed anywhere above in the text.\n\n    (+ 2 (if (&gt; b a) b a))\n\nThis almost makes sense, I see where the answer 6 comes from, but again I am confused as to why there is both an b and a at the end and why not just one or the other. To me this is saying if b is &gt; a, return the value 2 + b a. Is it only reading the b first and ignoring the a, and thus its reading out as 2 + 4 = 6?\n\n\n    (* (cond ((&gt; a b) a)\n      ((&lt; a b) b)\n      (else -1))\n      (+ a 1))\n\nThis seems to be saying if a is greater than b, return a. Its not if a = 3 and b = 4, so then if a is &lt; b, return b. This is true, and if b = 4 then b * 4 = 12 (+ a 1) or to put it another way 12 + 3 + 1 = 16. So I think I understand this part.\n\nAny help is much appreciated. If formatting sucks Ill try to change it, Im still learning a lot of things atm and proper online/Reddit formatting is one of them!\n\nEdit: Formatting and clarity of questions and my problem.",

I like math, programming, algorithm and data structures classes and plan a career as a software engineer in the future.\n\nOne thing that i struggle with is practical knowledge about hardware. I can add RAM to my laptop, but that's all. I'm intimidated with doing anything with the hardware parts of my computer, couldn't probably assemble a computer or clean a laptop, I always hand my stuff to the closest computer repair. I am afraid i will screw up something badly.\n\nMy theoretical knowledge is spot on tho, i had a class on computer architecture, read a few books about it, can name all the parts and know how to pick the right components performance/cost balance wise.\n\nThis is certainly not an ideal situation and i want to improve my knowledge. I see many people on my faculty going as far as doing all the small computer repairs by themselves, being proficient with a soldering iron etc. And they look down on other students who are being inferior in the hardware department.\n\nDear computer science enthusiasts, how proficient are you with dealing with your own hardware? What do you think i should pick up before graduation to not feel so embarassed? What's a sufficient level of understanding?\n\nWhat are some other practical computer skills not taught in university, but generally usefull and known by compsci students?\n\nI have recently learnt how to touch type. This one has been a totall gamechanger for me. Any other skills to learn?\n",

But because I know I want to get into game dev, I also want to also focus on C++. I dont want to learn any other languages first, although Im starting by reading SICP I dont plan on learning LISP. So Im happy to explore any good resources, but when it comes to actually learning a development environment and language I want to just focus on the one that will help me reach my goal of making games.\n\nIm also learning math, Im using Khan Academy for math, but am open to suggestions for better options too. My math skills suck at the moment so I am starting pretty basic with algebra and going from there. My goal is to get up to a calculus level understanding because I think thats what Ill need to be able to make games. Any advice here is also welcome in regards to better/other resources, or which maths I should focus on specifically. Right Now I am looking at learning most if not all of the \"high school\" material on Khan, then moving onto the college level pre-calc &amp; calc, and seeing where Im at when I finish that.\n\nSince Im self teaching Im trying to plot out a realistic learning curve. In the past I tried to just jump into making a game and it just didnt work between not being able to write basic algorithms and not knowing anything about CS... If it helps my specific goals are:\n\nLearn math adequate to program VR games\n\nWithin 2 years be capable of making/having already made my first game in the form of an android phone app written in C++\n\nWithin 2-5 years begin working on non-VR or even a VR game using C++ depending on how quickly I can learn all this",

One solution that comes to mind is routers would perform forwarding based on source IP as well as destination IP (I know that IPv4 has other fields by which pkt sorting may take place, and IPv6 has even more fields dedicated to pkt sorting). Hence, routers would need to have a record of IP address of all users (destination IPs) that payed for the add-on.\n\nAre any other ways this can be implemented by the ISPs?\n\nThank you!",

I was hoping to push forward in getting my bachelor's as soon as possible while living at home and making a bit of money house/pet-sitting for people, but this scenario is no longer feasible. \n\nTo get to the point, I need a job now, and I wonder if there are any Computer Science jobs available to someone who only has an associate's degree. Despite my current lack of qualifications, I feel like a job in my field would be best for me. I have Asperger's/ASD, and would not fair well in the typical college student jobs such as cashier, waitress, etc., which are primarily focused on customer service and tasks involving good short-term memory. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.",

        "text": "I'm an adult CS student currently living in what is pretty much a jobs desert for computer science in general, much less for my intended specialization. I'm obviously hoping to move to a more tech dense-area after I graduate, but that's where I'm based for now.\n\nUnfortunately for my college career, I'm an adult student with adult responsibilities. I own my own house, and so can't just find an apartment to relocate to another area over the summer, like a typical college-aged student might in the same situation. \n\nI'm at an absolute loss for what to do next. Is there such a thing as a remote internship? I'm willing to make almost any other compromise I have to to make an internship feasible. I want one desperately. I just don't know how to make it work.",

However, I just don't understand the explanations given online of why foldr can work with infinite lists but foldl cannot. This link here seems to explain it:\n\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/3082324/foldl-versus-foldr-behavior-with-infinite-lists?rq=1\n\nbut I can't understand his explanation at all, in particular when he makes these statements: \n\n\"Because foldl is backwards each application of f is added to the outside of the result ... This means that to compute any part of the result, Haskell first iterates through the entire list constructing an expression of nested function applications, then evaluates the outermost function\" \n\n(Doesn't foldr have to iterate through the whole list to generate the result expression also?) \n\nand \"foldr can transform one lazy recursive data structure into another.\"\n\n Anyone have a clearer and easier explanation?",
