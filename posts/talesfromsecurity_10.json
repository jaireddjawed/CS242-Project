        "text": "Just thought I would share a story from my first shifts working as a security guard. Being in a city where police and military presence is a huge factor, not a lot of things happen, but occasionally I get an odd story I'm proud to share.\n\nSo I had just gotted my license and I started working for a smaller company; not the best in our city, and has a reputation as a place that just hires anyone, but it gave me somewhere to start (I now work for one of the largest security company in Canada).\n\nIt was midway through winter, and the annual winter festival was just about to begin. I had just been given a months worth of overnight work as a roaming guard at a park in the centre of downtown, that is being used as ice scuplture contest, as well as a sort of hub for ice skaters to stop by and get some winter treats or souviners. With another few days to go, they had blocked off all the enterances to the park with simple iron barricades, to avoid random people coming in and messing about; their main concern was drunkards entering the park, and peeing on the unfinished sculptures. \n\nOn the Friday night before the festival started; around 3am, the bars had closed and me and my fellow guards were expecting the usual groups of people trying to take a shortcut or whatnot, and I was on my rounds around the park. I was nearing close to one of the entrances, and I begun to hear rustling in the bush, I pull out my flashlight and instantly, a obviously drunk teen jumps out of the bush and takes off to the street. Since the exit is blocked with the barricade, he was essentially 'trapped', however he could have simply went around it and be gone forever. \n\nNope. Apparently in his intoxicated state of mind, he thought the best course of action would have been to leap OVER the barricade, and continue on. So he jumps up, and like an Olympic hurdle jumper, he nearly made it swiftly over the bar. Nearly.\n\nHis back foot caught onto the top of the barricade, and he went tumbling face first into the ice covered sidewalk. It didn't seem to stop him though, as he quickly got back up, and continued walking at a brisk pace like nothing even happened. However as soon as I get to the barricade, I laughed as I discovered he dropped his cell phone during his escape. Feeling bad for the poor guy, I didnt want him to get home and realize his phone gone, but seeing as he was now 100 meters down the street (yeah thats right, Im Canadian, deal with it) I had no choice but to yell \"HEY DUDE! YOU FORGOT YOUR PHONE!\"\n\nNow this poor young drunk has to walk ALL the way back to me, look me in the eye, and sheepishly mutter \"thanks\" as he collects his phone.\n\n\nWhile this isn't the most spectacular of events, it really stood out for me as one of the first real 'incidents' that I've dealt with as a guard, and I am more than happy to have witnessed what I did. Just tought I'd like to share it.",

        "text": "I figured I'd share last night with you guys, some of you might laugh, so hey, enjoy!\n\nAs i stated in my first post here, I'm a pretty laid back, calm doorman.  I do my best to defuse situations unless there really is no option.  This was one of those times.  For those who didn't see my previous post I work as a doorman at a New Zealand bar/nightclub.\n\nSo a normal saturday night like any other, few intoxicated people who leave peacefully (relatively), until we get to the star of the story.\n\nThe Security/Duty Manager removes a guy physically, not too sure about the back story other than he was scamming on girls and then refused to leave after they complained to security.  Gets him to my door, where i proceeded to separate them, and walk the guy back a few metres.  Now my manager has a fiery temper when you stoke it, but he doesn't get agro easily so i knew something was up.  Being that the guys first language wasn't English it really didn't help the situation either.\n\nSo I've separated the guy and his mates are trying to pull him away, all the while I'm saying \"Walk away, have a good night somewhere else mate\", \"Guys take him away before the police get involved\" and \"Have a good night mate, but not here.\"  As i finish talking, he calms down, shakes his friends off and smiles and nods at me.\n\nThen he steps back and nails me right in the crotch with his foot.\n\nIt takes a lot to get me really going, but cheap shots do, and that was the cheapest shot in about four years of working on the door.  Before the pain even hit me, we'd both reacted; I pulled him into a bear hug and waited for my backup from the manager before we both put him to ground.  We finally (ten seconds maybe?) got him down, and i quickly took him into an ankle lock while my manager put him in an arm bar.\n\nLuckily for us, his friends were only half heartedly trying to pull us off as opposed to fighting us as well, because we really would have been in trouble, but they were more interested in getting him away from us and the police who would hopefully be showing up any minute, maybe out of fear for their Visas being revoked and deported.\n\nTen minutes goes by and the cops still haven't shown up, so we make a deal with his girlfriend and mates that we will let go and they can take him out of town immediately, but if he fights us again we will put him down a lot harder and he wont be getting up until the police arrive.  They agreed, and finally he wanders off a little bit worse for wear (he bit my managers finger on the ground and copped some flak for it) and left me nursing some seriously sore balls and my manager bleeding.\n\nNot one of our more enjoyable nights, but hey, we didn't get stabbed.",

        "text": "So I'm working another late night at a seedy motel; Previously mentioned in http://redd.it/1m6gaz\n\nAnywho, I'm hanging out in the locked lobby drinking coffee when a newer black Chrysler pulls up. A woman, maybe mid-20s gets out and she's wearing her nice vagina length clubbing dress and high heels. She's a slightly thick hispanic female though, and not anything close to my type so I wasn't really checking her out... at first.\n\nShe gets a room, and she's hammered. I mean, she can barely stand (its 0300, by the way). She's slurring words and holding on to the wall to keep from swaying. I'm still not paying much attention; drunk guests are at least half this motels business and since the desk clerk is behind a bullet proof glass window, I really don't have to worry about much. \n\nShe finishes paying and heads back to her car (and yes, she was driving). But she stops by the passengers side door which is facing the lobby. She puts her purse on the seat, and places one leg on the car and proceeds to pull her underwear off. What the fuck. And yes, I saw it all. Didn't really want to either.\n\nShe then takes here underwear and places them in the trunk of her car before driving off with no further issue. \n\nSo yeah. That was a weird night.",

        "text": "Greetings. New to this sub so it's only appropriate that I contribute. When I first started doing security, I was assigned to the downtown location of a well known grocery store. I quickly learned that this place had a constant stream of police cruisers coming by to pick up shoplifters, solicitors, and loiterers (lots of homeless people in the area). That store became what was the worst post I've been assigned to, yet the most fun one as well. I have many stories from that post but I'll just share a few today.  \n\nWhen I first got the post it was just me there. Shoplifting got so bad that they hired off duty police to be there as well. One day we had a man enter the store wearing a motorcycle helmet. He kept it on as he walked through the aisles. While he was browsing, some paramedics stopped by to grab lunch, and it was one of them that noticed motorcycle guy was bleeding down his neck. For the next couple minutes, the paramedics tried convincing the man to take off the helmet in order for them to ensure he was alright. Finally the off duty officer stepped in and ordered the man to remove his helmet. He did and we all just stared. The man had tried to steal four steaks by piling them on top of his head and putting his helmet back on.  \n\nFor another story, our store had a major problem with the homeless people stealing carts. It wasnt uncommon to open the store in the morning with less than 10 carts in the store. So they finally got those carts that lock the wheels if you take them past a certain point. Well, the off duty officer and I watched as a woman tried to walk off the lot with a cart, only to nearly fold over the cart when the wheels lock. Then as we watch, she and another person PICK UP THE CART and start to carry it across the street. Mr. Off Duty had to stifle his laughter and regain control of himself before heading over to retrieve the cart.  \n\nLastly, I had a man come up to me and report that someone had left a 6-pack of beer in the men's room with a few cans emptied. I suspected he was the ont that drank them but had no proof, so I thanked him for the information. After he left, the off duty officer was getting ready to end his shift and had changed out of his uniform. He was talking to the manager when Mr. Informant walked back into the store and plainly asked me \"Is that 6-pack still in the bathroom? I'd like to finish drinking it.\" After a bit of staring, I directed him to the off duty officer (who knew the situation) and tried as hard as I could not to laugh until the man realized what was happening. We ended up checking the tapes to find he had snuck the beer into the bathroom and with that he was arrested.  \n\nI've got many more stories from that post, but I think I'll end my introduction here. Hope you enjoy.    ",

        "text": "The door I work on weekends is an extremely up-market Cocktail lounge. As such, due to me running the door as tight as possible with a strict dress code and rigorous checklist for inappropriate patrons, we have only had two altercations in the space of a year, with the one I'm about to tell you being the second. Both times had been the result from people sneaking in through a side door as the Bussy usually occupies the other side cleaning trays. \n\nAnyway, after the [Princess](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromsecurity/comments/1mip98/princess_and_co/) debacle it was a smooth run for the rest of the night. I had just knocked off, as I do when the crowd is mostly leaving then arriving, with my 2iC on the door and My third Guard up on post. Ordering 2 fingers of Lagavulin, I get changed out the back. \n\nAt this venue it's required of the guards to wear a suit. Since I love my suits, I go all out; Vest, tie and pin, arm garters, you name it. Naturally the tie is on a release clip so no-one can choke me if they grab it. As I'm the only drinker on the security team, I often stay back for a knock off. The Directors love me here, and always make sure I get the good stuff. The only stipulation being that I don't drink in my suit. \n\nSo I yank the jacket, lose the garters, untuck my shirt and throw on my vambrace. Y'know the type that you see metal-heads wear to gigs? Yeah, one of those. What can I say? It ain't what I wear while I'm working. And I love my metal too.\n\nAnyway, I'm watching my SO enjoying a rare night out with her friends. [We have both had a rough time recently,](http://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1fvfmi/oh_really_well_allow_me_to_retort/) but she's getting better, finally out of the sling and back at work. I see the bar's photographer, out of the corner of my eye and flag him and my SO over, introducing them to each other. He's a good kid that one. So they wander off to the bar, and I'm just habitually scanning the crowd. \n\nWhen I saw the Ed Hardy T-shirt, warning bells rang. \n\nIf you're unfamiliar with Ed Hardy T's, they are generally worn by 25yo shaved head stereotypical Alpha's, tribal tattoo down one arm etc etc. *Most definitely*\n**NOT** our usual crowd, matter of fact it's top of the aforementioned I/V checklist for R/E's. \n\nI look around, can't see my floor guard. Hit the radio, find out they are sorting out a regular, well into his cups, with assisted exit and a cab. Tell him to come see me, tracking this guy the whole time. Naturally he wanders up to a group of well dressed ladies, starts making the moves. The are clearly not interested, but he doesn't take the hint. \n\nThen a man in an expensive suit starts walking towards the group from the bar with a tray of obviously girly cocktails. He stops, seeing the Alpha, sets his jaw, keeps walking. The Alpha notices him, squares his shoulders. Everything slowed, and I knew what was coming. I stopped toying with my Vambrace, jumped off my stool and started hurriedly towards the group, tapping the radio's send signal button rapidly, our signal for immediate backup. \n\nI arrive *in situ* just as the Suit plops the tray on the table and asks the Alpha if he knew the ladies. Naturally he doesn't and tells the suit as much, squaring up for a fight. I slide sideways between them, eye to eye with the Alpha, asking him to back off and come over here for a chat. Without a word, he chests up and shoves me into the Suit. *Damn,* I remember thinking, *I haven't  got my tag on.* Not that it would have made much difference to a guy like this. \n\nFar to the right, I can see my 2iC carving through the crowd. 5 seconds minimum. Alpha will go me again in 1 second. Suit to my back, crowd to the right, table to my left. Wall behind Alpha. Damn, that'll have to do. \n\nHaving weighed my options and seeing the Alpha stepping forward with cocked arm, I pull out the power play. All my strength these days is in my legs. Don't know why, but my legs never lost the muscle I had in my youth.  I wait for the punch (it was a right straight jab, fairly telegraphed as he was pissed), ducked down below it, and propel myself up with all my might. Connected with his nose slightly off center with the top of my skull, resonating as a meaty *thwack* vibrated down my spine. Man, my neck is *still* sore. This hasn't knocked him out as I hoped, just staggered him. I sink a left into the bloody mess to reiterate my point - [mashing my knuckles](http://i.imgur.com/sgK1lur.jpg) (pic after cleanup, blood was mine there) doing so, haven't thrown a punch in *ages* - jam my Vambrace into his throat, rotating my hips so he couldn't knee me in the cods, and held him against the wall. My 2iC had one arm by this point, other guard swiftly had his right. \n\nAs the boys are physically stronger than me, they frogmarched him outside, with me parting the crowd. Wasn't that hard, most people moved of their own accord. We get him outside and sit him down, he's still a bit woozy at this point. 2iC is grabbing the FA kit, manager is on door, and I'm alternating ice between my knuckles and my head. So *naturally* the police walk around the corner. The local Sarge, whom I deal with frequently at other venues, was visibly surprised, as this is the first time we had had this situation at the venue. (*The other altercation I mentioned was quite less dramatic than this and sorted quickly and quietly*)\n\nI gave him a quick synopsis, to which he asked for the CCTV footage. So the manager and I walk him up, leaving the other 2 cops downstairs with the Alpha and my 2ic, who was still cleaning the Alpha up. Watching the footage, I felt sick to my stomach when I saw myself connecting with the rising headbutt. As I have mentioned before, I'm primarily a talker in this job, and only get to violence as the **ABSOLUTE** last resort, I abhor doing so. To my surprise, the Sarge didn't comment on it at all, only asking to see the Suit that I got pushed into. I take him back out of the office, re-enter the bar and point him out. No sooner had the Sarge opened his notepad, I hear the Rapid Response clicking on the radio. I tap the Sarge's shoulder as I ran past to get back outside. \n\nSure enough, Alpha's coherent, and he is *pissed.* the other two cops had dropped him to the 'Shut Down' position, with my Guard on his legs. Sarge see's this as he comes out, and directs everyone towards the Divi Van. Got everyone's details that were involved, put the Alpha in the back, and continued on his way. \n\nWhich brings me to the title. \n\nA few hours ago, the photographer sent me a text asking for my email. We go out a bit after work, as I said, good kid, so I trusted him with it. He has sent me a photo he took moments before I jumped off my stool. It's title?\n\n[Like. A. Motherfucking. Boss.](http://i.imgur.com/5NeSazh.jpg)\n\nI'm hanging this one in the Pool Room. \n\nGentlemen, Ladies.\n\nEdit; I showed the Photographer the responses here, so he sent me a [photo from his trip to Lebanon](http://i.imgur.com/UxAtLO6.jpg) as thanks to all. I think he out- badassed me.\n\nSecond edit for spelling.",

        "text": "Sorry all, had to re-submit as I forgot the no Reaction gif rule. \n\nOriginally titled 'MRW a tiny Princess threatens me and my job for kicking them out.' Gif is [here.](http://i.imgur.com/wp390.jpg)\n\nAnd this was the story;    \nExcerpt straight from my report, name's changed and Italics for extra info. This is *exactly* how my emails go with the Directors, we got a good working relationship;    \nNow, Princess' Hens. Long story Short, they were approached but NOT REMOVED (as they left of their own accord) for failure to comply with instruction of staff and Security, Unacceptable and Quarrelsome Behaviour and possible Prevention of an Indictable Offense (Drugs) and they were explicitly NOT happy about events. You are probably looking at their complaint email before or after this one, and be prepared for us to be shown as nothing short of baby kicking Hitler-esque puppy stabbers. The following is a play by play of what happened between them, Tony  and myself, I believe that Manager is writing his separately so I have only included him in peripheral:\n \n* About 2205 5 Females walk down the stairs to the food court, lead girl (Blue floral dress, Irish, from here on referred to as I.F) appeared to tap her nose before trying to enter the disabled toilets with the other 4 females. circumstantial at best, hence the possible prevention i mentioned. but 5 people in one cubicle after a nose-tap? C'mon.    \n* Tony, who was re-briefing Mick on a few things, directed them to the Food court toilets. I.F told him 'I work here\" dropped The managers name. Tony, seeing through the obvious bluff, reiterated toilets are out the back. \n* I.F started mouthing off, (\"Whats the big Fucking deal?\") while 2 of the females headed to the back toilets, saying to Tony \"Don't worry about her\" in an dismissive way whilst the other two went into the disabled toilet.    \n* I.F asked if she could stand there to wait for her friends, Tony said that was ok. I.F then proceeded to shepherd other patrons away from the Disabled toilets, with lines like \"No, Dont go in there, staff only!\" with heavy sarcasm and blatant disrespect of all.    \n* Tony asked her to stop doing so, she replied \"But you said I could Stand here!\" (Facepalm)    \n* The 2 females exited the Disabled Toilets at this point, and were arguing about its use with Tony. He reiterated a third time that it was not for their use, pointing to the Out Of Order sign for the third time and returned upstairs, with the women following behind.    \n* Tony informed me of what had happened and took over door, I went upstairs to get a visual on the group plus I.F and informed bar and Manager that I.F was not to be served any more alcohol due to her U/B.    \n* Minutes later, one of the other girls had bought a drink and immediately gave it to I.F. Tony intervened and reiterated no more alcohol to the I.F. At this point one of the group (light/white dress, blonde/light brown hair, from here on referred to as MP *for MouthPiece*) Started arguing with Tony, refusing to acknowledge why, nitpicking every minute detail. Essentially trying to 'Lawyer' him. steadily became more aggressive to the point that Tony actually thought she was going to slap him. *Really.*    \n* Quick side note: She allegedly runs 150 staff in hospitality venues, as manager, with I.F being on her HR team.    \n* After a few minutes of this, Tony reached an impasse, and asked if i could take over. (*Im quicker on my feet with arguments and usually play bad cop in these situations*)    \n* MP pulled the same thing with me from the start: quick transcript of the first minute or so to give you an idea of what I'm talking about. This is almost Verbatim, as I was quite frustrated after it and wrote down the instant I could for this report:    \nMe: Ladies: I believe there has been a mis-communication here?    \nMP: Yes there has.    \nMe: Very well, I'll clarify; the lady over there in the floral dress (Pointing towards I.F) will not be served alcohol again tonight due to her Unacceptable behaviour shown downstairs earlier. Furthermore, the lady over there (pointing towards the one that bought her a drink) will also be refused service for buying alcohol for her in knowledge of this. I can't be clearer than that ma'am.    \nMP: You really need to be less aggressive!    \nMe: I'm not being aggressive, I'm just not smiling ma'am.    \nMP: Don't call me Ma'am, and you should be smiling.    \nMe: I don't find anything funny here, hence why I am not smiling. Now if there is nothing further? \n(I turn to walk back through the curtain, but MP grabs my right arm at the elbow and pulls me back. Check the camera around 2225 or so to confirm)    \nMP: Hang on, I wasn't finished talking to you.    \nMe: With respect 'I' was, I have nothing else to say about the matter and I have to return to my post. If you don't mind?  \nMP: I DO MIND! Which one is supposed to be intoxicated?    \nMe, pointing towards I.F: I didn't say Intoxicated, i said she had displayed Unacceptable Behaviour. The lady over there.    \nMP: You really should calm down.    \nMe: I am calm...(pause whilst a few other patrons enter past us)    \nMP: No you're not, and she is not drunk, because that was the wrong person you pointed to. (Big Grin, thinking she caught me out)   \nMe: The description i got from Tony was early twenties, blue floral dress, irish accent. 3 girls in your group with a floral dress, only one with irish accent, which I confirmed earlier.    \nMP: Oh, so you didn't even SEE which one it was?     \nMe: Personally? No. But I trust the other guard and his judgement.    \nMP: Aren't you head of security?    \nMe: No, I am not.    \nMP: Well, who IS then?    \nMe: The original Guard you spoke to.    \nMP: Its because she has an irish accent, isn't it?\n \nThis went on for another frustrating 5 minutes, possibly longer. Felt like longer. MP dissected every sentence I spoke, questioning every single choice of words, changing angles when they weren't going her way etc. as a second female *(Princess)* started chiming in when she could, nothing constructive of course, just all back handed insults towards us (Tony and I). \n\nThe entire time I was trying to end the argument and disengage, as it was clear they would not listen to anything we said, also Tony wasn't wrong: MP did look like she was ready to hook me one.    \n\n* From what I gathered from their end of the conversation, MP and co believed that we had discriminated against I.F due to her being Irish, and \"misunderstood her intentions because of her Accent.\" - quote from MP.    \n* The Female next to MP finally let slip that they had been to 3 wineries since 10am. MP had walked away at this point to (I believe) argue with Manager near the bar. Not 100% there, as i was focused on the lady in front of me. \n* She finally said to me 'Thanks to your power struggle ( I believe she meant to say Power TRIP by the way, that's the usual implied insult) we are leaving, as you can see.' In an attempt to make me feel guilty or reconsider (I think?). I look over my shoulder and sure enough they are getting all their gear ready.    \n* I sidestepped, parted the curtain and said \"I can see that ma'am, sorry you feel that way. Door is this way when you are ready.\" She didn't leave, and returned to her table instead to collect her belongings.     \n* I took this opportunity to get back out the front. Asked Fred to take over door from Tony, as I believed Tony and myself at door would have exacerbated them. I stood over near the car park ramp and lit a smoke as i was bloody frustrated by this point from pointless arguments and keeping a calm facade throughout, naturally. Tony went upstairs to cover the floor.    \n* Important to note here, that not only did the I.F leave in tears, saying \"Sorry, it's all my fault!\" but when they all were outside MP shouted and i quote \" FUCK THIS PLACE THEY ARE ALL RACIST CUNTS!\" as the whole group laughed.    \n* Might just mention here that this group of 20 women were refused entry at every other venue in line of sight by other security through their own actions. *Sister venue* knocked them back too, found that out after work when i was chatting with one of the boys down there.\n \nAll in all, I don't think they will write me a love letter anytime soon.\n",

I went on a brief vacation (first one in 14 months) and just got a new job working armed security for another company  (it’s one of the big US firms)\nThe background: Same security firm as the last story, http://redd.it/1kocv3 but a different post. This occurred at a rather seedy motel (it’s not too bad, we cover much worse places) that borders a convenience store, a McDonalds and a Jiffylube impersonator. The motel is two long parallel, 2 story buildings. The area the story takes place in occurs at the far left corner room. I’m the only security officer, and the client employee is a night auditor who I will refer to as NA.\n\nThe story: Around 0130, NA calls me over the radio to come to the front office so she can explain something that’s going on. That’s fairly common as the radio clipped to my belt is a cheap Motorola that’s probably 15 years old (minimum). I hustle over to the front office and she lets me inside as we keep it locked from 2300-0600. I make some coffee while she explains what’s going on. \n \nWhenever a guest calls 911 from a room phone, an alarm is triggered allowing the employee to listen to the call. So room 217 calls 911; It’s a female calling, requesting the police take her male roommate to the crisis intervention unit (its like an ER for psych issues) at the hospital a few miles down the road. So they send someone out to check it out. Meanwhile, I go make a presence near the room, just to check out what’s going on. A female, early 20’s maybe, is loading baggage into her vehicle. She tells me the police are going to take her friend to the hospital as he’s having some severe mental issues. Eventually she goes back into the room and a police car arrives. So I do a patrol of the motel and head back to the office. \n\nOver the next hour and a half, I spend most of my time on the opposite end of the motel, dealing with some unruly guests. That’s when I get a call from NA about a report of shattering glass near 217. So I run over there. Yep, glass is covering the vehicles parked below 217. 217 window is shattered and I hear someone shouting for help. I radio NA to call the police. Inside the room, a male is inside lying on the floor, shouting for help. He has ripped a lamp off the wall and strewn trash about the room. I shout to him through the window asking what wrong, what can I do to help. And he just keeps shouting for help. Apparently, that cop didn’t take him after all. And, there is no sign of his female friend or her vehicle. Well damn; its my fault for not following up, I just assumed the police would handle it (I have a good rapport with the cops in this area) \nWell, there’s no way I’m going in there. This guy is clearly nuts. So I just wait around until the cops show up and hand them a room key when they arrive. Eventually around 8 cops arrive and enter the room through the broken window (the door was dead bolted so the keycard still wouldn’t open the door) with weapons drawn and eventually coax the man out of the room. I never get an explanation for what occurred. \n\nBut, while I’m filling out an incident report as the police are finishing up, a middle aged Hispanic male (he had a heavy accent that I had some trouble understanding at first. But this is Texas) comes out of 117.\n\n117 “Yeah this guy’s been yelling for 2 hours. And look; now my car is covered with glass. What are you guys going to do about that?”\n\nMe “so let me get this straight. You heard this guy yelling for help for 2 hours and you just ignored it. Because, hey, he can still breathe so I guess he isn’t in that much distress right?”\n\n117 “well, ugh I….\n\nMe “and all your worried about now is what I’m going to do about the fact that your 15 year old Toyota Camry is covered in glass. Well, that’s not my problem. Talk with the motel in the morning. Otherwise, there is a carwash right over there” and I point to the gas station that has an automatic car wash.  \n\nApparently 117 didn’t say anything that morning, and all was right with the world once more.  \n",

Obligatory back story: I've been in security for 3 years, generally doing events from football matches to gigs to royal events, and everything in between.\n\nSo I was working at a major gig venue in a major city, some awful band was playing but I was working with another guy on the stage door/guest list. Shortly before the afterparty started, we got the usual rush of people from the main auditorium to our door. One guy said his name to my colleague, not on the list. He goes absolutely nuts, screaming \"DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHO I AM I'VE PLAYED HERE A HUNDRED TIMES YOU SECURITY ARE ALL THICK YOU JOBSWORTH WANKERS\" (not exact but you get the idea). He's screaming this at two security guards, one of whom is a former serviceman and the other (myself) whose hobby is kickboxing. Eventually we get him away from our door (it wasn't pretty) and get back to the list. We sort out the next guy pretty quickly, apologize for the wait and the guy in front of him, blah blah, without really looking at him. \"What a knob, mate. You shouldn't have to deal with dicks like that.\" I hear. I look up, and none other than Johnny Vaughan is stood in front of me calling some randomer a knob. Had a chuckle, let him in, and suddenly the night seemed a little better.\n\nTL;DR: Some guy pulls the celeb card, doesn't work. Actual celebrity of sorts calls him out on it.

        "text": "This just happened about two hours ago and it's eating away at me. \n\nI currently do the security for a campground, divided by a river, in the middle of a university town. This year has been pretty quiet so far (except for a group of twenty people in bathing suits trying to break into the pool at the beginning of the season, but that's another story entirely), and now that school is about to start I've been getting people trying to cut through the campground to cut off a few minutes when trying to get home, which I'm supposed to prevent. However, since I'm done working security Saturday night, I've been a bit more lenient with it if the people behave.\n\nTonight I saw a group of students approaching my post at the main gate to the campground. Feeling in a pretty good mood, as there had been heavy rain all day and it had just stopped a few minutes ago, I figured I'd let the group cut through if they behaved. Of course, I'd have to escort them to get out the back, as the rear gate was locked and I had to make sure they weren't looking to steal or damage property. I explained all of this to them, and they were fine with it, so I let them in. \n\nThe first thing they did was head towards the pool. The pool, of course, is fenced in and is locked at night - I'm not even certain I have a key to the gate, honestly. One guy decides to start fiddling with the lock before I warn him that the pool is off-limits. Now, in this group there were six very attractive women, all of them certainly less than sober. The women plead with me, telling me that they just want to strip off their clothes and slip into the pool. One of the women even insists that it's been a lifelong dream of hers to go skinny-dipping. The guys, hearing this, start pleading as well for a chance to see the women naked. Some of the guys start trying to bribe me, then questioning my sexuality as I continue to decline them. While I certainly wanted to just let them into the pool and watch those women slip out of their clothes, I also didn't want to risk losing my job before Saturday. \n\nThey finally relented after realizing I wasn't willing to budge, and I escorted the group across the campground without further incident, aside from having to listen to them complain about not being allowed in the pool and just how much the women wanted to just strip naked then and there, if only there was a body on water nearby. I offered to let them swim in the river, but due to the heavy rain the current was much fiercer than usual. \n\nAs they left, I was stuck wondering if I should have just let them into the pool or played it safe as I had. I've been dwelling on what I could have done differently for the last two hours. Would it have been worth losing my job? Was there any real risk of being discovered, as the campground is nearly empty now that Labour Day is over? \n\nI'm rather regretting not just letting them into the pool, but I can't go back on it now. My mind knows it was the right choice in the long run, but my body's still lusting over what could have been.\n\nTL;DR - Some new university students wanted to go skinny-dipping in a pool I wad guarding and I wouldn't let them. Now I'm regretting it.\n\nSorry, I just wanted to vent, as it's still pretty fresh in my mind.",

        "text": "First reddit post!! Kind of a long read.\n\nOK, quick background information on me. Just recently got this security gig through the help of my father. Previous job was retail, hated it. I have no security experience but neither did any of the other applicants. Regardless, I've been told that I was the best candidate of my group (idk if true or not but it made me feel great!). Been here for about 2 months and I'm liking it so far. My father and I do work together, but in separate shifts so we don't see much of each other.\nMy job is relatively easy so far. We have numerous posts, which usually involves specific duties for each one. The post I've been assigned to for the meantime is fairly simple. Walk around once every hour, call in any \"security hazards\" (broken window, broken door, etc.) or repairs, occasionally escort a female to her vehicle. Like I said easy stuff. The joke about my post is that its kind of like a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. From the hours of 8am-5pm, its a public building. From 5pm to 11pm, its private property for University use ONLY. Emphasis on the \"only\" because I have the authority to kick anyone out who isn't involved with the school.\n\nStory time. Anyways, I work the second shift (3pm-11pm) so I usually get the easy end of the public crowd. The reason its public is because theres an unemployment office within the building. Not just employment either, they help out with benefits and other government assistance programs. As you guys can imagine, unemployed people/people on benefits are usually not the kindest. I've seen so many people curse out their case worker over things they have no control over. The public crowd, as I refer to them as, is usually the one you have to be wary of. So many thefts occur in the 1st shift and there isn't anything we can do about it. One guard having to look over about 100 pedestrians and our occasional rounds through the building + parking lot, we're going to miss out on something. \n\nSo today, it started out pretty normal. The guard I was relieving tells me there was a cellphone theft this morning, nothing new. He leaves, I do my walk around and chat with a few workers to see if there was anything they thought I should be aware of. One of the workers tells me that she wants to cite a Trespassing Warrant on an individual. As a guard, we can't issue one ourselves but we work hand in hand with the officers so they respond right away when we call. I call one of the officers and he arrives shortly. Normally the entire process can be done by just the officer but today, since it was slow, another officer responded just to help things go by smoother. Seeing as how I'm new, I wanted to see first hand how this situation gets handled. 3 law enforcement employees + 1 confused gentleman = not a good idea. \n\nThings were going smooth, one of the officers took the gentleman's ID and stepped away so he could check for warrants, etc. The other officer was questioning the individual about several claims of harassment while issuing the warrant and I was by his side kind of just observing. We didn't want to block any hallways so the entire ordeal was happening right beside an employee side exit. When it was just one officer, the guy was cool. Once he saw all 3 of us I guess he got scared. In what seemed like a split second, an unknowing employee taking a lunch break opens the side door....yeah, he ran. Bastard was kind of quick, but luckily the original responding officer parked his vehicle right in front of the guys car (pure coincidence). We catch up to him and put him in this \"escort\" position. Basically, one person on each side of the individual incapacitates each arm. He's scuffling about trying to break free but it wasn't gonna do him any good. We call the third officer back, who had no idea of what just happened, to arrest the individual while we have him down. Turns out the guy had a completely clean record, he could've gone home that day but decided to be an idiot. That quick little chase though, talk about a spike in adrenaline lol.\n\nCliffs:\n- Fairly new to security job, don't get to see much action\n- Worker tells me she wants to file a TW on someone\n- Officers show up, question individual.\n- He gets scared and makes a run for it.\n- He didn't succeed.\n\nFeel free to ask me any questions about the job, benefits or myself. Haven't worked here long but I practically know a lot more than I should thanks to my dad.",

        "text": "Background; I work at a bar, we get a mix of 18-19 year olds, yuppies, and LOTS of cougars.  Basically a pretty diverse crowd.  I've been a doorman for about three years on my weekends, I'm not a trained fighter, I'm a brawler if needs be (luckily not that often).\n\nSo I work in NZ, my bar on saturday night is pretty packed out to capacity, more so when the National or Provincial Rugby games are being played, and last night just happened to be one of those nights.\n\nNow our local council have made it part of the liquor licence for every bar and restaurant (who choose to stay open) that at 2.45am, it is a one way door policy for the final 15 minutes until we officially shut our doors at 3am.  For any who don't know, this means for the last 15 minutes people cannot enter the bar, only leave.\n\nSo at 2.58am on the dot this drunk, probably 18/19 year old, heavily intoxicated stumbled up to the door and tried to walk past me and my door mate.  I stopped him before he got in and explained to him the bar was closed to which i got the response \"Oh ok Bro...I just need to come in and find my friends.\"  he then tried to push past me and again i stopped him and gently moved him back outside our door line to the street, and again explained that it was illegal and he was more than welcome to stand outside and wait for what was now less than a minute.  For the next 5 minutes (we ended up taking a little longer than usual to disperse everyone) he kept asking me the same thing and trying harder and harder to push past getting more and more physical each time, and i kept explaining and pushing him out.  I'm a pretty tolerant guy, it's why my boss has me on the door (I'm only 5.11, most of the doorteams around the city are over 6 foot) but the second he put his finger on my lips and told me to 'Shush' it crossed a line.  I've been hit too many times to tolerate physical contact of any kind and i immediately slapped his hand down and warned him not to put hands on either of us again.  \n\nThe second i finished talking he swung at me, and being drunk and obviously slow therefore, i locked him up in a crossarm and radioed the manager for the policing unit who deal with all the trouble in town.  As i was holding him up against the wall outside our bar controlling his struggling with extra pressure every now and then, a guy who we had denied entry to (convicted sex offender) comes out of nowhere and blindsides me in the back of the head.  I turned round pretty much ready to throw down if i needed to only to see the cops come sprinting around the corner and just bodyslam the guy straight into one of the garden areas alongside the road, along with the guy i'd already locked up.  There is nothing more satisfying than watching dickheads resist arrest, everyone should get the privilege at some stage of life.\n\nTL;DR Stupid drunk guy doesn't listen, puts hands on security, gets arrested along with another criminal for assault.\n\nEdit: 5'11, not 5.11...",

I'll make this one a super quick story. \n\nBackground: I work security for one of the big security companies (hint, we wear a lot of gray), in a large Texas city. This post is a fastfood establishment located in the downtown area, near a homeless shelter. Time is roughly 2130. And just so you know, I'm an in shape 22 year old male who keeps his uniform Ironed and wears black boots; So I don't look like a pushover.\n\nStory: Basically I'm standing around just trying to kill the last thirty minutes of my shift. Its gotten pretty busy at this very small establishment (that shares a parking area with the motel next door, which also is guarded by our company) and I just got done dealing with broken down vehicle in the drive through (had to force a guy to get towed which is another story). \n     I'm staring at some a small group of teenagers who look stoned; but they're at the Motel so they're not my problem (the guard next door may work for the same company, but we have no actual way to communicate).\n     Suddenly, I have a relatively thin white guy stumble right in front of me and proceed to yell about an inch from my face, \"Give me some Fries Mother Fucker!\" and as he says that, a shower of alcohol tinged spit showers onto my face and even into my eyes. \n     At this point, I'm basically stunned into inaction. He manages to stagger off property (again, very small site) in about 5 seconds. I basically can't do anything at this point. If I call the cops they won't show for at least 30 minutes (I can say this from experience) so I just let him stagger off. \n    Surprisingly, I'm not even very angry. I just go inside and wash my face off real quick and finish off the night. I never did see that individual again.  \n    And don't worry guys, I have more stories to post; and in a lot of them, I actually appear to be good at my job.",

Our company does mostly gate control, checking on outdoor inventory, and traffic control.\n\nI work with two other gaurds, and we have my boss. The two guys I work with are fairly timid to the other workers and truck drivers that come on site. I find this a little annoying (As does my boss, honestly), since this pretty much lets those who come on site (Drivers) and workers try to walk all over us and give us an attitude when we need them to follow our direction. This has relevance, trust me. \n\nSo about a few months ago, we have a driver come in to grab a load. While we're figuring out which company he was with (He wasn't marked well, and the driver had absolutely no clue. You think you'd know who signs your paycheck, yeah?), I spot him go out from his cab, and *proceeds to open one of our gate arms to let a person from management out of the plant.*\n\nMy initial thought was \"He...didn't just...\" and before I knew it, I'm outside stating **VERY** firmly and with a direct tone \"DROP THAT **NOW**.\" Driver meekly drops the arm and backs away. I'm already up to the management person (we have to sign them out of the plant), I in my most polite voice apologize for my outburst, and explain to them why I did what I did, she smiled at me, I signed her out, and let her out on her merry way. \n\nI looked back at the driver, who was *still* out of his cab (Despite being told once already before we let him on to the lot that he MUST stay in his cab while we figure out his situation) and said \"Get **BACK** in your truck, **NOW**\" to which he meekly walked back to his cab, and waited like a good little driver. \n\nI returned to our guard shack, to having both of my fellow guards just staring at me in fear. I asked them if they thought I over did it, to which Jake [not his real name] (Who is a renown whiner in our little group) responds with \"Yeah dude, you sounded like you were going to rip his head off.

I have encountered many security \"professionals\" that I would consider quite the opposite. From ESL people to extremely afraid nympho females and everything in between. People I have worked with have admitted to me that they have used cocaine. Steroids are also quite obvious when they're in use. I have acquired this knowledge because I am quite libertarian and have admitted my marijuana usage, however I don't think drugs should be used on shift and especially not in work of this nature. My management is terrible, though I am sure most security companies work this way. E.g. pay discrepancies, no relief, arrogant attitudes etc. I make [basically] minimum wage. \n\nI digress, to my stories:\n\nOne time a security guard arrived on my site 10 minutes after the start of his extra coverage shift [late]. Clearly he was stoned, but I was oblivious at the time being that I had assumed he must have been tired or something else. 30 minutes later he is seen on camera entering a bathroom, this is a very secluded part of the site that has little traffic. We get a complaint that said area smells like marijuana, I and my partner investigate to find him stoned out of his mind watching T.V. on his phone in a nearby room [away from post]. We questioned him in turn, first my partner and then me. He told my partner he had not seen anyone in the area, he then told me that it must have been \"the old man.. 20 minutes ago\". We reviewed the cameras and discovered that he was the only one in the area since the beginning of his shift when I first escorted him to his post.. We write a formal report, did not inform the client, and notified our superiors immediately. A management guy showed up 4 hours later when the smell had dissipated and the guy had time to burn out. This management personnel stated, \"it must be his middle eastern food and the fact that he is a slow speaker so he seemed impaired\". This management smelled of alcohol. A few days pass and I decide to follow up with my direct manager to inquire about disciplinary action and express my distaste for the event. I was officially informed that I could not talk about the event and unofficially informed that I was lucky that the client did not hear about it. I was warned to dropped it otherwise I might face a defamation of character lawsuit from the person in question. I later found out that this employee makes more money than me, was on overtime pay, and later got a $250 award for taking the most extra shifts in a period to help out the company.. He still works for the company.\n\nAnother time, currently even, there was a new full-time employee for the swing shift. This guy is the epitome of corruption. He's an only child, struts around like he owns the place. Smokes cigarette wherever he pleases (against policy). Talks about his car. Total douche-bag. I could write for hours about how much I dislike him and that he shouldn't be a cop ever but I wrote enough already.. Long story short: he has sex with females while on shift and on site and then brags about it to our 40 year old mother client liaisons.. he is still employed. After getting away with that, he was \"reprimanded\" (4 days off with pay), he now struts around proclaiming to people that he too also smokes marijuana while on shift.. The worst part of all this is that the site is a mental health facility. This douche-bag even said to me one day, \"I am so much better than these people [the patients]\" ..\n\nTL;DR: Security guards doing drugs and having sex while getting paid to do it are higher up on lists than me to be hired as Police/Corrections/BorderServices/etc.. \n\nWhat do?",

Here's the number to the facilities manager, he's on-site right now and will likely tell you the same thing I just did, but you're welcome to try.\" I handed her his business card and slid the desk windows shut. \n\nI am a security guard, who is paid well to follow the rules that the clients set - NOT paid to break rules for you. I can't tell you guys how happy I am to have a permanent site placement after today. I'm sure there will still be issues, but nothing like this. \n\nPS: I had permission to direct folks to the facilities manager, don't worry, he was ok with handling troublesome tenants.",

        "text": "Hi! I just subscribed. Been a uniformed guard for about 5 years, figured I'd share one of my more humorous stories.\n\nThe site: a high end apartment complex near several nightclubs. A public parkade was attached to the building with a separate entrance. Residents had a key access door to the parkade, but non-residents had to go around to the main parkade entrance, no public entry from the apartment lobby.\n\nA guy in his 20's walks into the front entrance, tries to open the locked door, and when that fails, tries harder. I come out of my office and ask him if he's looking for the parkade, to which he says yes. I tell him to leave the lobby and go around. I don't think I said this aggressively, I wasn't in a bad mood and there was no reason at this point to consider him a problem.\n\nInstead of thanking me and moving on, he says \"am I being detained?\"\n\nIm a little confused for a second, and ask him to repeat himself. He simply says again \"am I being detained?\"\n\nOf course I tell him no, he's not in any trouble and explain again. He just keeps repeating \"am I being detained?\"\n\nIm getting fed up, so at this point I tell him to get out, he responds the same way again, i tell him that he is now trespassing and does face arrest if he continues to stay. he again keeps repeating \"am I being detained?\"\n\nSo now I'm irritated, we've been at this for about 10 minutes and I've told him a few times that he's trespassing, and so I escalated and said \"Yes. You are now under arrest for trespassing.\" and he is dumbfounded, but nonetheless complies until police arrived to take him. Explained what happened to them and they were just as confused as I was.",

        "text": "Ah, the joys of being a young female security officer. This is a recent tale from just a few months ago. I was called in to cover a short shift in a sketchy part of town, a little strip mall with a grocery store and gym. They'd been having a lot of car break-ins. My job was to walk around the complex constantly, looking for any prowlers. Unfortunately for me, I found a different kind of person. \n\nAs I cross in front of the grocery store for the fifth or sixth time, an older (60s, at least) man steps in front of me. As I step back, he exclaims \"Shit, girl, what's a fine young thing doing this job for? Ain't you got a man to bring home the checks? Or uh, maybe a wife?\" He winks. \n\n\"Sir, I'm doing a job that I worked hard to get, in order to pay for a degree I'm passionate in, and I don't at all appreciate your idea that I need someone else to provide for me because of my gender. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm here to prevent break-ins, and that's what I'll continue to do.\" \n\nHe stares at me. I thought I was free, but as I stepped past he grabbed my arm and said \"Girl, that was mighty disrespectful, you saying them things.\" I've yanked my arm away and have set it on my hefty flashlight (the only \"defense\" I have), but he just continues on about his many granddaughters and how he'd teach them a lesson if the ever talked to him like that. I didn't feel threatened, but at this point I'm wondering if I should call a supervisor. \n\nDuring my internal debate and his talk about his granddaughters, a middle-aged woman with a toddler come over and ask him what in the world he's doing, chatting with an officer who needs to do her job? He grumbled and went off with them. \n\nPhew! Later, when discussing this with a family member who is also a security guard, he said I should have said something less combative. I accept that, and won't respond in such a way if I get those kinds of comments again. ",

        "text": "Well howdy Do security guys, UK reporting in.\n\nFirst a personal intro: I worked for 4 years in an Students Union Bar/Venue/Nightclub. The first year I was just on the bar, in my second year I was supervisor. Then for my 3rd and 4th years, I got my personal license to sell alcohol and my SIA (Doorman) License. This was after 2 years of nagging from other Security Guys, as at 6\"6 and 23 stone (Rugby Player and American Footballer) they wanted me on the team as \"deterrent\" (like that works right?)\n\nNaturally this meant I worked when I wanted, and I have sure picked up some tales from this job.\n\nI will give some of the best small nuggets now, and more if approval is good :)\n\n1) Wee Pete and the Moshpit.\n\nWee Pete was a nice guy (5\"7 rake thin), recently badged (security licensed) and was rather keen to work for the SU. Unfortunately for Wee Pete, he was not familiar with Rock n roll or Heavy Metal. So then Skindred came to town (Reggae Metal band). Wee Pete has his first Barrier Posting, it's like he's Real security now. Then as expected a moshpit occurs. Now, I'm on the other corner of the barrier, enjoying the speaker stack behind me, handing out water, and looking out for any prats. Wee Pete sees the Pit occur and Radios in \"Fight, fight, Fight, Main Dance Floor, Main Dance Floor\" and dives in to try and stop it.\n\nOh Wee Pete, you poor bugger. The crowd thought he was joining in and pushed him about with a ragdoll, he tried to radio again but to no avail. He eventually staggers out a minute later as the song ends just as the 3 other Door lads get there. Wee Pete Gasps:\n\n\"I couldn't break it up lads, can I get a hand?\"\n\nNeedless to say, we stuck Wee Pete on the door and Bearard Butler took over on the other Barrier corner.\n\n\n2) Bearard Butler and the Shaggers.\n\nBearard Butler is a giant of a man, I thought I was big until I met Bearard. He is 6\"9 and about 28 stone. But he's solid. In the week he works on a farm, basically I think he's employed as a tractor. He also looks like a cross of Gerrard Butler, a small bear, and Brian Blessed.\n\nWe had a particularly chavvy Music night, and as expected they were off their faces from the go. Everything is going well, only 2 drug problems, and 3 evictions for being pissheads. Standard. Then we get the call from the bar radio:\n\n\"Security, Security, Main Bar. 2 People are, erm, I think theyre fucking\".\n\nWhat. the. actual.\n\nBearard takes the response and I follow up (due to the night security were paired up for responses).\n\nJust as I get there I see it, one guy sat on the sofa opposite the bar (10 feet away) while a girl in a short skirt is riding him like a pony. a classy act.\n\nNow Bearard sees me coming and says \"I got this\". And he puts on his leather gloves. \n\nHe deftly lifts the girl off the guy, putting her to one side, grabs the guys dick, snaps it back into his trousers. then with the other hand hes lifted the guy up by the belt to a standing position. He than turns around, and reverses 8 feet to the fire exit bumps it open with his arse, turns again, dumps the guy outside, turns back closing the door behind him clicked shut.\n\nThis all took 5 seconds. \n\nIt was truly awesome to see Bearard at work sometimes. He then walks over the the bar, removes his gloves, chucks them into the bin and ambles off to the door.",

I think they're waiting for people to leave their vehicles so they can break into them.\" I tell the tenant that I'll go check the vehicle and the suspicious individuals. When I get there, I find the custodian (in uniform) who was training a new guy (also in uniform). I've worked with the custodian for half a year now and he is an extremely diligent worker, but because he's Hispanic he gets profiled quite a bit. I tell him about the phone call and we have a good laugh about it. Now don't get me wrong, I appreciate any lead I can get from a tenant since I don't have CCTV and can't be everywhere all the time, but it sucks to be stereotyped.",

        "text": "Hello, I have many stories to tell so maybe these posts will become more frequent. \n\nBackground: I work the parking lot at a private beach in the summer in a town that is a popular vacation spot.  Often in my days working the lot I see a lot of people be it funny looking joggers, families on bicycles, or the occasional turn around.\n\nIt's a hot day, hottest it had been in a while, 95F and humid, there was also a poor air quality warning in effect. Me being asthmatic I brought my inhaler with me to work that day. \n\nSo it's around One in the afternoon, temperatures at its highest, Im just sitting there under my umbrella and I'm sweating. In comes a family of 5 riding bicycles towards downtown to get lunch. The youngest, about 8 or 9 years old, is starting to cry.. The family stops at the entrance to my lot to see whats wrong. He tells them he can't breathe.\n\nThis angers the father because they had to stop.The father had gotten off his bike and had the boy do the same. He yanked the kid by his arm and sat him on the rock by the entrance. The son still in tears and the father yelling at him to \" stop crying and QUIT BEING A FUCKING PUSSY\" (direct quote from the father).  The mother, who had fallen behind, finally caught up. The boy tells her he cant breathe. The mother says \"It must be his asthma acting up, and I forgot his inhaler\"  I'm hoping she would at least pull out a bottle of water or something for the boy to drink but no apparently she just liked carrying an empty backpack.  It was at this point the father getting angrier because the boy wouldn't stop crying. This was also at the point where I made the decision to jump into the situation having heard everything. I asked the mother if she knew what kind of inhaler the boy had, Which at this point I was expecting her not to know, She told me albuterol, the same as mine. So I got mine out of my bag and also a water from my cooler and gave them to the boy. The water made him stop crying and then I had him use the inhaler.\n\nThe mother thanked me for helping and gave me $20 for helping which I declined and refused to take no matter how badly she wanted to give it to me. I looked at the boy and asked if he was alright. he told me he was and hugged me for cheering him up.  I turned to the father looked him in the eyes and said, your son is in no way a \"Fucking pussy\". I turned and walked away and noticed the look on the mothers face wondering why I had said this to her husband. ",

        "text": "Several years ago I worked at a post that wanted very tight security. Nobody, including employees, were allowed to have cameras, camera phones, recording devices, or any type of weapons on the property. All deliveries had to come through the same gate and had to consent to a search of their vehicles. If they didn't consent, we would tell them to turn around and figure out themselves as to how they're going to make their delivery. Guns were found in vehicles the most. Being Texas, that was really no suprise. \n\nOne day my coworker was conducting a search and she finds a pipe and a tiny baggy of weed. She brings the stuff and the dude into the gate house and calls our boss. He arrives, inspects the goods, and tells the guy he obviously won't be allowed to make the delivery, he isn't allowed back on the property, and the police will be called. About ten minutes pass and I guess the guy comes to a realization. He says \"I can leave whenever I want to can't I?\". My boss tells him we're not holding him. So he says \"I'm going to go ahead and leave\". He walks to his car and it doesn't start. He ends up having to tow the car and the cops show up just as the tow truck arrived. He ended up just getting a ticket but what a bad day for him. He gets a ticket, car towed, and probably lost his job. I felt bad because he was not a douche about anything. He was just really embarrassed.\n\nA similar event happened a few months later. My buddy was searching a vehicle and pulls out what appeared to be about half a pound of weed. This guy didn't mess around. He snatched it from my buddys hand, jumped in his car and took off. I don't know whatever happened with him. I turned over all his info to my boss. I forgot to mention, I took down names and license plates when vehicles enter the property. Also, new visitors filled out questionnaires that included social security numbers. So yeah, probably wasn't a good day for him either.",

I work as a security guard in a big retail store. Part of being a security guard in this store is being very knowledgeable about the store and it's products because in the event that someone needs help then we must assist. Also if someone attempts to steal, we need to know what exactly is our product and with that I digress. \n\nSo I was standing on the front doors when one of my coworkers approached me and informed me of a possible theft. He stated that some customers were currently on register paying for a $250 bicycle but they had a gel seat on the bike and it was missing the tag that has the price. My coworker also noticed that the customer was not going to make any attempt to pay for the gel seat. \n\nI alerted the other security guard of what was going on and told him to scrutinize the receipt for that customer. If he noticed that the gel seat was in fact on the bike but not purchased on the receipt then to please ask the customer if they have another receipt. \n\nAlright so the customer approaches the exit door and the other security guard asks for the receipt for the bicycle. He notices the gel seat cover on the bicycle and it wasn't purchased. He points it out to the customer, at this point I get closer to them in the event that the situation escalates. My buddy let's them know that the bike does not come with the gel seat and asks if they would like to purchase it. They continue to state that the bike seat does in fact come with the bike and they grabbed it from the area it was in as such. I then step in and asks what's the problem. The customer explains how my buddy is trying to accuse them of stealing. I explain everything again and tell them that if they want the cover then they have to purchase it and I would be happy to get them another cover which does have the tag on it. They agree to this after realizing their defeat. At this point, one of the customers gets very red in the face because he knows we're on to him. And his wife continues to act as if she doesn't know any better. \n\nI head over to the section where the seat cover is usually located and I look around the immediate area. Within a minute I was able to find the broken tag/package that encases the seat cover. I head back to the exit doors whilst holding the package behind my back. I get to the door and show them the package. The husband turns so red with embarrassment I swear he almost went purple. The wife's eyes bulges out so far in the most Wtf state. They agree to pay for the seat cover and they go on their merry way. \n\n\nTL;DR Customer attempts to walk out with a bike that they purchased with something they didn't purchase attached. I embarrassed them.",

I didn't know it when I got hired (as a Cigarette-Butt-Picker-Upper 3rd class) but the entire company was a front for some very shady Irish people (as in Irish-in-Ireland). They also owned the cleaning company that serviced the mall, and the security firm who provided those services. \n\nTax-scam much? Anyway they never really gave a crap about any of the businesses that rented their units, most were also elaborate scams but they wouldn't turn their noses up at actual cash money being waved in front of them if it came from a non-scammy, outside source. \nSo it came to pass, that one day an entrepreneur decided he would locate an American Style Sports Bar, in this scammy mall, in an area of Dublin for which the description \"ravaged by heroin and street crime\" would have been a euphemism. \n\nI met the guy a few times and I have to say, he was a total prick but in my role versus his, our interactions were more of the [to me] \"fetch me this\" variety. Maybe he is nice to his kids, I dunno. \nSo they get the unit outfitted, prior to launch and I have to say it looks quite nice, looking from the outside in. Diner-style banquettes, nice big windows, decent oval bar and about a million cable points for all the televisions that are going to festoon the place. \n\nThen he makes the mistake at baulking at the security bill he's getting while the place is being fitted. In fact, he didn't \"baulk\" at it, he had a standup screaming match with the Head of Security (1. a former Irish national power-lifting champion 2. A man I'd seen personally CARRY a budgie the helicopter kids-ride down a flight of stairs. 3. Thick as thieves with the incredibly dodgy owners of the mall and 4. Not a terrible sort really, quite a nice bloke you stayed on the right side of him). \n\nThe HoS, says nothing. The guy is screaming at him about being ripped off, finger jabbing, spittle flying. The SON of the HoS (a security supervisor there) wants to murder Sports Bar-guy naturally but is held off by an up-raised finger from his father. The HoS waits for the guy to finish says - I was there - \"I'm sorry you feel that way, Mr._____\", and walks off. \n\n\nAbout a week later. Sports-bar-guy has the first lorry load of TVs delivered. Nice flat screen jobs when flat screens cost a bomb. Where can I put them says delivery guy to me (I'm outside having a smoke). Ring the bell for security and they'll open the loading bay I say. Which he does. I don't know why, but he puts the whole truck there and no-one unloads it there and then. It stays overnight (but you know, exterior shutter down, controlled access, cctv etc. \nNext day I arrive to work and Sports Bar Guy is going fucking MENTAL. Seems that at some undefined point when the place shut down @10pm and this morning, someone has somehow stolen every single flat screen TV from the loading bay. Guards (Irish Police) are there and all, while I'm watching they ask HoS to review the CCTV. \n\nHoS says calmly as you like: \"Sure, no problem, but we've already had a look and there was a problem on that camera last night - the tape is blank\". \n\nThe next day, from my station in the arcade, I can see the HoS and the bosses of the company that owned the mall, having a tasty drink or twelve (in the restaurant they owned) and laughing like mad over something. \n",

He then had his wife drive him there and took the truck back to the site, stranding the guy. \n\n**Side note:  One day I was doing a shift with this new girl. We were bsing and I whined I had to drive all the way to \"Hometown\" (about an hour drive) the next day to visit my brother. She said \"you're from Hometown? Me too.\" Turns out we graduated high school together. Neither of us knew one another out of a graduating class of 150. How is that even possible in a small town?\n\nWhat are some of your horrible coworker stories? I unfortunately have many more.",

        "text": "Working the quiet gaming room again tonight from my [last](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromsecurity/comments/1hxfqg/quiet_night_antics/) post. \n\nI honestly can't remember if I stated this in the former post, so I shall mention it here. The Gaming venue I'm working in is a part of my city's Chinatown district, and as such out clientele is predominately older Asian's.\n\nSo.\n\nTonight, I have heard an intermittent *thump* every now and again, with my experienced ear telling me someone is hitting a pokie machine, specifically the side of it. As the floor in the section which the noise was emanating from is a crowded one, I haven't been quick enough to actually locate the person doing so until around the fifth time.\n\nNow the Manager here actually spotted who was doing this at first and I was side by side with him on the approach.\n\nThe culprit was a regular, and quite the high roller. Usually plays through between 2-3k a sitting. And this particular night, he was getting pretty drunk. Not falling off the floor drunk, but enough that it was noticeable.\nHe had been at the venue for at least 6 hours, and had been drinking (unusual for him) with around 7 considerably younger Chinese lads, only stopping a few hours previous.\n\nAnyway, I tap the manager on the shoulder, signalling I'll approach first. Standing off to his side, I started the usual dialogue;\n\n\"Sir, may I ask that you please not strike the machines?'\n\n*mumblemumblemumble*\n\n\"I'm sorry sir, I didn't catch that.\"\n\n(Thick Chinese accent)    \n*I break, I pay. Go away!*\n\n\"Sir, perhaps I'm not being clear. I asked you not to hit the machines. Now I'm **telling** you not to do so.\"\n\n(Louder)\n*I break I pay! Fuck off!*\n\nI look over at the Manager, eyebrow raised. He starts his spiel;\n\n\"Look Zhou (not his real name), we know you come here often, but you can't hit the machines, they cost too much to repair.\"\n\nWell Zhou turns around and launches a half-drunken tirade at the Manager, how said manager always victimises him (apparently this has happened before), threatening to take his business elsewhere, that he wasn't drunk etc etc. \n\nI step back up to the plate, as I had noticed that the rest of his clique were already making their way out with the exception of one, who was trying to get Zhou's attention. \n\n\"Again sir, the points you make are irrelevant to this conversation. What is relevant is the fact you have shown blatant disrespect to the Manager and myself, and therefore the venue. And since you have decided to be belligerent about it, you can leave. Door is this way sir, your friends are already outside.\" \n\nHe rounds at the Manager again, completely ignoring what I just said.\nThe younger male gets my attention and has a quiet word in my ear. Apparently Zhou is pissed off because he was treating the young guy (lets call him Chi) and his friends to drinks as it was Chi's birthday. Then Zhou got a phone call, finding out he has no other choice but to work the kitchen at his late night Chinese restaurant, as his chef pulled out sick and no-one else answered the call. He hates doing this apparently, as at this time of night its nothing but drunken idiots eating there and running amok. \n\nA moment of recognition happens; Chi always sorts me out with super hot chillies when I eat there, which is at least once a week. Its well known in my city for its good food and quick service, and is open extremely late so it gets a substantial amount of business on weekends when clubs close down around here. Great Mongolian Beef by the way. \n\nZhou is calming down a bit and starting to make his way out, so I thank the guy and walk in front of Zhou to open the door. When he is outside, he turns on me with the same thing he has been saying to the Manager;\n\n*I come here all time! 8 year! I no come back! I speak to boss! I can pay if break!*\n\nPatiently I reply;\n\n\"Sir, if I came to your house and tried to use your TV, but it did not show a clear picture, I wouldn't kick it. So if the machine isn't paying you, I expect that you would not kick it. Please understand that I am simply doing my job, nothing more. Have a pleasant night sir.\"\n\n*Not good night! I not drunk! I own Zhou's place! Have money to play! Fuck you! Go away!* \n\nHe wanders off, muttering to himself in the direction of Zhou's Place. Chi and friends apologise and go the other way.  As I'm tracking Zhou, I notice the yelling has got big Dev's attention down the road. He gives me a thumbs up, which I return. Zhou walks straight past him. Dev pulls out his phone, and calls me.\n\n'Hey Dev. You saw all that yeh?'\n\n*Yeh, fucking tool. What happened? Standard?*\n\n\"Pretty much, smacked the machine so P/E for U/B. (Passive Eviction for Unacceptable Behaviour)\"\n\n*Fair enough. You know he runs Zhou's, yeh?*\n\n\"No shit? I thought he was bluffing. Young fella told me the same thing.\"\n\nWe chat for a few minutes, talking about what had happened and confirming our traditional after work heads-up poker game at his venue.\n\nFast forward to about 20 minutes ago. I'm standing on the door having a cigarette (Yes, previous readers will note I had given them up, but I have had a rough week and bought a deck of smokes almost automatically) when a HUGE group of blokes stumble into view, roughly 30 or so, *blind drunk*. Carried on all the way down the street, kicking bins and hollering, as the young bucks often do. One of them pipes up and slurs a question at me. \n\n\"Oi security? Where's the nearest Macca's?\" (McDonalds)\n\n\"Keep heading down the street sir, 2 blocks on the left.\"\n\nLightbulb.\n\n\"Tell you what though sir, there is a great little Chinese joint around the corner here. Cheap quick and tasty as hell.\"\n\n\"Aw yeh, sounds alright! Whereabouts?\"\n\nI give him directions to Zhou's, to which they stumble off in the direction thereof. I'm human enough to admit I fist pumped when they turned the corner, obviously going to Zhou's.\n\nGuess I'm ordering take-out there for a while anyway.\n\nDedicated to Azza and his Father. \n\n**One of the greatest victories you can gain over someone is to beat him at politeness.**\n\n*Josh Billings*\n",

I work in an awful part of the city. There are two kids down at the corner that sell crack and the majority of my time outside is spent shooing homeless people from patrons. Anywho, it was the seventeenth of the month and everyone had gotten their welfare checks, thats when the crack traffic is highest. \n\nWhat happened was, on the corner near the bus stop there was a commotion. Then suddenly pops which I initially attributed to fireworks.  Two guys were not so lucky that night and I saw one drop near the bus stop, the other walked two steps and dropped. I radio it in, my managers come out and luckily mostly stayed outside with me dealing with the police.\n\nAs i was radioing in the incident, a woman pushes past me screaming at me\n\n\"I don't know what you guys are doing, you need to do something\"\n\nWe have it under control, ma'mn\n\n\"I don't know if you know but someone just got shot out there\"\n\nI know ma'mn, I was outside\n\nThe crowd was the absolute worst. They came outside and took pictures of the bodies and police tape to put on Facebook and Instagram. They were posing with the police tape. \n\nWe had to close right after the show and decided to close reentry right away. This woman left and was told to go across the street or walk down the sidewalk. Mind you, half the police force is hanging out right outfront. She tries to bum rush my coworker and I to get back in because she was waiting for her boyfriend. \n\n\"After everything that has happened tonight, I do NOT want to be alone outside\"\n\nDumb.\n\nTL;DR: I hate rich people.",

        "text": "I first posted this story, which contains what I consider to be a hambeast with a severe entitlement complex, to /r/fatpeoplestories. Sadly, even though a lot of people liked it there, it was only a matter of time before the \"There isn't enough fat logic!\" brigade came out in force and got it taken down. So this story is now seeking a new home here at /r/TalesFromSecurity.\n\nI'm a security guard at a major hospital in a major city. Some people are surprised by the high level of security in place at a seemingly normal hospital. Without giving away too many hints about which hospital this might be, lets just say that there are a lot of reasons for the higher than average level of security for a hospital, primarily the fact that this hospital is quite new, and it is set up for mass casualty events. I won't bother with a lot of backstory, since I'm sure everyone else here knows how a general security job goes.\n\nWhat this means for the purpose of this story is that when you visit my hospital, I search your bags before you come in. Deal with it.\n\nMost people don't have a major problem with this. In fact, thanks to the psychological conditioning of the TSA at the airports, some folks see a guy in a uniform standing next to a metal detector and they instantly start stripping off their clothes. I have to tell people fairly often to stop that, we aren't the TSA and nobody wants to see naked people in the lobby of the hospital. Not cool.\n\nHowever, some folks are always still shocked and offended to see security in a hospital. They may ask why the hospital has so much security, or they may even take some of their stuff back to their car in order to avoid having their bags searched. It can often be highly entertaining to see people stop when they see security, get an odd look on their face, reach into their pocket, realize they have something they don't want me to see, and they promptly run out of the building. Hilarious.\n\nToday is the story of the fat woman who didn't want to be searched, and later stormed out of the hospital.\n\nIt is a busy night, thanks to a concert at a nearby venue and a high influx of drunk people coming in from said concert. I'm standing at the triage desk, which is where people are searched before entering the emergency room, and on the security monitors I see that *A HAMPLANET APPROACHES!*\n\nHamplanet is a middle aged (40-50) woman, maybe about 250-300 pounds. Her skin sags everywhere, covered in wrinkles and stretch marks, suggesting she may have weighed much more at one point. Her flabby body is made extra visible by the fact that she is wearing nothing but a pair of extremely small womens athletic shorts and a badly stained white tank top. She \"walks\" with a cane in one hand, which is much more like a combination of a fat person waddling and a drunken sailor with scurvy hobbling bow legged. The fact that she is using her other hand to haul a giant purse which may be as large as she herself is probably doesn't help her mobility issues.\n\nGradually, hamplanet makes her way through the automated doors and into the building. Upon seeing me she makes a motion to hand me her purse, but as soon as I reach out to take it, she suddenly changes her mind and snatches it away.\n\n&gt;\"You know what? NO! I've been in here four times before and I don't want to do this again!\"\n\nWith that declaration, Hamplanet turns around and hobbles/waddles back out the doors. I show no signs of surprise at the fact that such an obviously unhealthy woman has visited the hospital so often.\n\nBack in the parking lot, she screams \"*RICHARD!*\" at the top of her lungs. Her screaming can be heard *inside* the building...\n\nA scared man comes running out of the parking lot with a look on his face that suggests he has heard this screaming before, and it is never the herald of good news. He accepts the purse and retreats back into the parking lot...\n\nHamplanet returns to the desk. Sensing some tension here, I make little conversation and simply instruct her to empty her pockets of any metal items and step through the metal detector. She complies and the scared man follows her into the building a few minutes later. Presumably the nursing staff ushered the woman into the emergency department after that. I had other people to deal with, so I didn't give it much more thought...\n\nUntil about 15 minutes later... Hamplanet comes storming out of the back of the emergency department into the Triage area/waiting room.\n\n&gt;\"RICHARD! They put me in the hall!!\"\n\nAs I said, it was a busy night at the hospital, thanks to a concert going on nearby with a lot of underage drinking. This causes us a lot of trouble on nights when it happens and we spend most of the night dealing with a massive influx of drunk people, drug addicts and general-purpose crazy people. Often, this means we run out of rooms and have to start putting people on \"surge beds\" in the hallways (as we try to confine the worst trouble makers into rooms where we can keep an easier eye on them, and strap them down to the bed if necessary).\n\n&gt;\"If they was gonna run outta rooms, they shoulda told me!\"\n\n\"Richard\" comes running out of the waiting room, with that same terrified look on his face...\n\n&gt;\"Couldn't they just write you a prescription?\" Asks Richard...\n\n&gt;\"No! I ain't waitin' in the hall for that! We're leaving!\"\n\nAnd with that, the Hamplanet stormed out, her minion \"Richard\" in tow not far behind.",

        "text": "(I originally posted this story over at Tales from Retail, but I was told that this subreddit would appreciate this story as well.)\n\nWorking in big box retail has yielded me some amazing stories.  Some involve unruly customers, most involve Black Friday, and a few result in some hilarious attempts to steal shit in the store.\n\nYou've all been in big box stores, so I'll describe this one's layout.  (Remember = Don't guess!  Youbanistan is not a fun place to visit...they don't have cookies or milk at all!)\n\nThe layout at the time was that your PCs, Televisions, Appliances, and all the big ticket items were on the outside of the main floor.  We had a white and black walkway that was a gigantic square which wrapped around the store and separated the big ticket stuff from the smaller items in the center.  Inside the center were cameras, cell phones, and most importantly, shelves upon shelves of CDs, DVDs, video games, etc.\n\nMiddle of the week in this store was boring as hell.  Most of us kept ourselves entertained on our earpiece radios by playing guessing games and commenting on the mullets that came into the store and even giving a rating by referring to them as \"Code M\" which would prompt about ten employees to start looking at the department.  Our LP guy was a good friend of mine, and at 6'7\" with a hilarious sense of humor, the store tended to be more fun when he was watching the cameras up front.\n\nOn this day, however, we got our entertainment from a short woman who decided she was going to try and rob us blind.\n\nIt was a little cool outside, but nothing overbearing as it was early Spring.  This woman, however, had come in wearing extremely heavy and somewhat baggy pants, a winter jacket, sunglasses (kept them on indoors), and a heavy sweater underneath.  It wasn't a minute before she was in the DVDs and already frantically looking around and just acting sketchy.  My friend at LP, we'll call him Alex, hits me up on the earpiece.\n\n**Alex:  Hey man, can you wander over by this woman in DVDs and see what the hell she is doing?**\n\n**Me:  Yeah...why?  Is she acting strange?**\n\n**Alex:  Oh yeah.  She did a triple take at one of the cameras I have locked on to her.**\n\n**Me:  Wow.  Why is she bundled up like it's 20 below outside?**\n\n**Alex:  That's why I want you to watch her.**\n\nI set up camp about three aisles diagonally from her and actually had a good view.  Sure enough, this woman grabs a bunch of the cheap DVDs that weren't in security cases, looks around, and stuffs them down her pants.\n\n**Me:  You catch that on camera?**\n\n**Alex:  Yep, already calling the police now.  Just keep locked onto her.**\n\nShe wasn't content there.  She made a few stops along the way, stopping at the Xbox 360 section, the Blu-Rays, and the PS3 games.  Hey, at least she wasn't a fanboy of one system or the other!  Thieves apparently don't discriminate!\n\nShe spent the next ten minutes or so walking around to make it seem like she was just browsing.  At this point, there are four of us basically watching her from a distance while we wait for the police, who showed up in the form of two cruisers outside.  One was set up in the parking lot, the other pulled up alongside the front of the building just away from the entrance.  Alex went out to greet him, where the officer was outside stretching and limbering up.\n\n**Alex:  Why are you stretching, sir?**\n\n**Officer:  I hope she runs.  I need a workout!**\n\nMeanwhile, back in the store, our little thief had caught on to the fact that she was being watched the entire time and was putting the cheap DVDs back in a different spot than the belonged.  Once she did that, even though she still had plenty of other things, she loudly announced to everyone as she made for the exit \"I PUT EVERYTHING BACK DON'T YOU ALL DARE TOUCH ME YOU FUCKING PRICKS!\"\n\nOye.  Some people just don't get it, do they?\n\nOf course, the alarm goes off when she hits the exit and bolts right past Alex as he's coming back into the building.  Now, store rules for us meant that once she was outside the store, we couldn't chase her.  However, Officer Workout was ready and, sure as shit, she took off the moment she saw the cruiser.  We would find out later that the officer used to play safety for a Division Three college nearby, which wasn't a shock as he performed a beautiful form-fitting tackle on her in the middle of the parking lot.  You know the type I'm talking about:  Getting her from behind, lifting her completely off her feet, but making sure that he set her back down on the feet like you would in football warmups when practicing tackling form.\n\nNo injuries, no blood, just getting the thief.\n\nThe best line of the day, though, came from the officer after he brought her back in for us to show her the security tape and to fill out our official paperwork on her.  He heads out of the office and comes over to us, giving us his direct phone number.\n\n**Officer:  Seriously, guys, just call me next time and not dispatch.  I love this shit.**\n\n\n**TL;DR - Woman decides to steal shit from store, finds out that officer was ex-football player and knows how to tackle!**",

        "text": "Not all clients have the same needs, and your responsibilities as security isn't always standard. Our security company had a select group of trusted personnel that handled problematic, high risk, and new clients/venues. \n\nI very quickly worked my way into 'trusted' status, by my ability to solve problems efficiently, my ability to keep a cool head, and also a fair bit of charm and good social skills. \n\nWe got a new venue, and I was pulled into our office and consulted on the account. It was on a trial basis, and the customer owned several bars in the area. He started us off on the first bar he ever owned, and it was styled and catered towards an older, more sophisticated crowd. In short, I was a glorified ID checker there to keep out the riff raff. I usually didn't need to ask for ID as most of the customers were 40+, and my job was pretty boring most of the time. A few drunk arguments filled with passive-aggressive bravado. Sitting on my stool waiting for people to show up. Listening to local tribute bands butcher classic rock. The highlight of my nights usually consisted of making some middle aged women smile by asking for ID. It's definitely a skill to assess which women will be flattered by it and which ones would be offended or feel put off by it. I had a pretty high success rate, and it brought satisfaction to me that I could bring some joy in their life. Or at least levity! \n\nMost evenings started out pretty mellow, and as patrons got more and more intoxicated my job became more entertaining. I set my stool just inside the inner doors, and had a good line of sight of the bar, dance floor, stage and restroom doors. The dance floor was just inside the doors in an empty area, with a raised area against one wall that was considered the stage. The place was known for live local bands, and the drunk women loved to dance with each other (poorly!). \n\nI would constantly have older women dance for me or on me, and it was flattering even though I was rarely interested. On one occassion, this gorgeous woman wanted me as a plaything. After dancing and showing off her moves, she started pushing up on me. Started by whispering in my ear while covertly brushing her hand against my chest and abs, then started kissing my ear... She whispered her name in my ear, *Cindy*, and walked away biting her lip at me. Danced with her girlfriends some more while making bedroom eyes at me. I got called over by the manager, who told me that she was a regular and I was in no way to displease her. It was implied the account depended on it. \n\nFast forward to the end of the night, she's trashed and unable to drive. Her friends smile at me as they leave her behind, and she hands me her keys and goes to talk to the manager. He comes over and tells me I'm done for the night and all the bartenders are leering at me over his shoulder. \n\nI walk out with her, help her get into her Mercedes and walk around the back of the car to the driver's side. It was then I knew she was money, because she was driving a 2009 C63 AMG that still smelled factory new (This was in late 2008, btw). Opened the sunroof and put it in gear, pulling out of the parking lot slow. As soon as I got mostly straight on the road, I looked over at her and gunned it. I got way too much satisfaction watching her breath hitch as we were pressed back in the seat. We had that carefree laughter of revelling in the moment. I ask her where she lived, and she pressed Home on the Navigation. \n\nWe pull up and straight into the garage, and she's all over me before I even put the car in park. Her hands start searching my groin and I move my leg to give her better (less awkward) access. In the process, my foot comes off the brake and we jerk forward, ruining the moment. We burst out laughing anyway, and I put the car in park while she presses the button to close the garage door. \n\nWe head inside, and she throws down her purse, kicks off her shoes and puts on some music. We open a bottle of wine and start drinking and dancing. I have no head for wine, and dancing soon turns to heavy petting in her living room. We make our way to the couch and she trips us up. We end up on the floor, spilling the wine. She starts drunkenly cursing, and I start cleaning up the spill. She goes to change into some dry clothes. I mop it up and seek out her bedroom. She managed to strip off her clothes, but failed to get redressed. She's laid out on the bed, passed out. I put some water by her bedside table and crash on the couch. I wake in the morning to her squeezing between me and the back of the sofa to cuddle. We talked for a few hours, and she finally questioned why I slept on the couch. She actually laughed at my '*White Knight*' answer of her being passed out! She said it was \"sweet\". Her response to my exaggerated affront was to kiss me and lay her head on my chest. After she kissed my neck for the third time I kissed her long and hard. It turned to heavy petting, and heavy petting turned into amazing wake-up sex. \n\nI went home later that day. I had already missed my morning classes (I was going to community college at the time), so I just called the school day a bust and went to bed. I got up and got ready for work that night, and was let down because she didn't show up. I was hoping for a repeat, but didn't get one for several nights. \n\nOn one of my nights off, I got a call from a fellow trustee. He was working that bar and had been approached by the manager asking where I was. We had only had the contract for a week, and it was my first night off. I figured the manager was pissed bc he thought I would be there every night, so I told him to give the manager my number. Lo and behold, *Cindy* calls me wondering where I am. She convinces me to head out to see her there, and I get teased by the bartenders and staff behind Cindy's back the whole while. Apparently, I wasn't her first boy toy. I did find out that her husband had been a doctor many years her senior and she was his trophy wife. When he died, all their fortune was hers. \n\nI went home with her that night and she really put it on me. I felt like I was a stallion before her, but she really put me through my paces that night and many nights after. All in all, I was her boy toy for two months and I had no delusions I was the only man she slept with. But she was attractive, wild, and rich. The allure was too much to resist. When my car broke down, she let me drive her late husband's vintage Jaguar (and I got ridden all night by the staff at the bar after they saw me pull in driving it, and later by Cindy in a night of drunken passion). We even went out to Myrtle Beach for a weekend. It was odd for me, the role reversal. I was so used to paying for dates and being in control, but it was flattering to be wanted for nothing but my company (even if a majority of the reason for my company was sex). She bought me things, showered me with gifts, and routinely opened my eyes to how the world didn't have to be how I always perceived it to be... \n\nIn the end, she dropped me abruptly and without seemingly caring how I felt about it. She was like a child that got bored with a play-thing. She sat me down and walked away to what caught her eye next. I was surprised at myself, because I knew the ride wouldn't last forever. I was still hurt at how easy it seemed for her, but I just went back to living my own life. \n\nI ended up working that bar for another month before the first black couple happened to come in. I had turned away other black people (and people of all nationalities. All in all I turned away more white people who looked trashy than anyone else), but it was based solely on dress code. No boots, no sandals, no low hanging chains, no undershirts (aka \"wife beaters\", but I HATE that name!), no sideways hats. Had to have a collared shirt. I knew the rules were structured mainly to keep \"thugs\" out, but they come in all colors. Like I said, I was there to keep the riff raff out. But when this respectable looking black couple came up, I didn't hesitate to let them in. I held the door for them like I would anyone else, and even gave the man a food recommendation that he asked me for. \n\nNot five minutes later, the manager approaches me visibly upset. He questions why I let in the black couple. While trying to make sense of this change in his demeanor and obvious racism, I look over to see many of the caucasian patrons by the bar making disgusted faces. It was then that it set in these people were elitist snobs. Before they welcomed me in as one of their own and never let any of that hate creep into sight. But the disdain they had for that older black couple was evident. It was the \"you don't belong here\" look. The manager told me I had to ask them to leave, to which I refused. Honestly, part of me wanted to keep him happy, but I couldn't lower myself to do something so vile. He gave me a ultimatum, ask them to leave or he would have my boss send out someone who would. Again, it was implied the account depended on it. I stuck to my guns and refused. The manager storms off and minutes later I get a call from my boss. He's FURIOUS that we are about to lose this customer. He tells me to sit tight, a replacement for me is on my way and that my job is now in question. I kept a cool head and told him that I welcomed a replacement, but that he should make sure it was a caucasian. He was confused, so I explained the situation in full. He asked me to put the manager on, so I walk over and hand my cell phone to him. He has a brief conversation with him, and then the manager slides my phone across the bar and it falls to the floor at my feet. I was pissed, but I bent down to check and see if my phone was OK. I wanted to ask him what my boss said, but he had called me right back and said, \"*Fuck that guy, we don't want contracts like that. You're done there. WE'RE done there. Do you want me to find somewhere for you to finish the night? We had a couple guys call out*\" \n\nIn the end, no one was needed. Other guys had been called in, so after waiting around a few minutes to hear back from him, I ended up driving home. We never worked for that bar or any bar that guy owned to the best of my knowledge. I did get commended for standing up for what's right and not tarnishing the image of the company, and 'retrained' on how to handle those situations more effectively in the future. Luckily, they were few and far between. ",

        "text": "TL/DR: Not very interesting. No crazy story, but it took me prowling a majority of the posts here to even realize I *had* a story. Seizing on the memory, I figured I'd submit it.\n\n***\n\nA few years back, a friend of mine, J, was heavily into working security, for all kinds of events. We were in our early twenties. He had his unarmed and armed certifications, concealed carry license, and spent a lot of time studying weapon and security jurisdiction laws, doing firearm training, the works. He had some crazy stories. Sadly, our friendship deteriorated and he's hardly an available resource to share some of his tales, but if you peruse the other threads in this subreddit, you'll get the idea of the kind of anecdotes he'd share.\n\nOne weekend night, while I was in college (he wasn't), there was a huge rave out in the Arizona desert. We were pretty close at the time, and J invited me to come hang out with him while he worked the front. We got there early and did some donuts in the dirt beyond the parking lot, horsing around and enjoying ourselves. Time came for the shift to start, so we moseyed up to the front, and he checked in. His duties were probably \"bitch\" duties, but it was a light event and nothing serious was really needed. Checking arriving ravers for weapons, illegal substances, that sort of thing. Given that the typical female attire was bikinis or less and the male dress code consisted of bro shorts and maybe a tank top, it was a pretty light pat-down and visual inspection. \n\nEarly in the shift, I sat with him for a while, just shooting the breeze. He had his security gear on (unarmed), I was wearing jeans, probably without a shirt. More people started showing up. I left for a bit while he worked, since I didn't want to be a distraction, and prowled the rave for half an hour, looking on bemusedly at all the kids partying and tripping on stuff they managed to sneak in. (There's always a way, huh?)\n\nI headed back to J and stood next to him while he processed the arrivals. Despite my obvious lack of any security markings or equipment, some kids split from the line in front of J and approached me, queuing up with their little handbags out and the foremost with their arms akimbo, awaiting inspection. Looking back on it now, picking up his checkup duties next to him was clearly a bad idea, for more reasons than just liability on the security contracting company. But I did. I patted down the guys, checked their pockets and hats, patted down the girls, and checked their purses. For a warm-blooded twenty-year-old male, it was a pleasurable experience. All the while, I had no freaking clue what I was looking for or what I expected to find. Or what to do about it if I found anything (besides call J for help). I didn't do it for very long, since when that crowd of ravers cleared out, I boogied it out of the way so that any more incoming kids would not mistake me for a checkpoint.\n\nAfter that, the night carried on; I browsed the inside of the rave fence a few times, listening to the music, and J and I did some more donuts on the way home. I think the most fun part of the night was stomping glass bottles into the sand and shattering them on our way out.\n\n***\n\nI'm sorry that my tale wasn't more gripping, but just in case, thanks for reading nonetheless. I'm enjoying the stories in this subreddit, and will keep hoping for new submissions! Because damned if J didn't see some wacky shit, and I always liked hearing about whatever nutty event went down during a work shift.",

It's a /r/casualIamA I composed last week. \n\nThe following tale is a condensed version of one of my favourites, and is also in the link up there. \n\nIn this instance, I was asked by /u/bigmommykane; 'Tell me about the craziest female You have ever thrown out of a bar.'\n\nHo-Hoo, one sprang immediately to mind. Princess type, complete with blonde hair, frilly pink dress and tiara hair thing, had her 21st In the private bar/function area above the club I ran about 8 years ago. Eventually got removed from the venue for Unacceptable Behaviour ( catch all term over here, predominately used instead of the word Intoxicated) and tried to barge through us to get back to the party. \n\nNow, normally we give birthdays a bit of leeway, because they usually pay for the bar and have a few minders to look out for them and reign them in if needs be. Not this one.    \nHad Spoilt brat practically stamped on her forehead. \n\nDecides when she can't get back in, she would pick a fight with a woman in the line who was laughing at her. Gets promptly pushed on her arse for it. Goes for another round, where I physically (but lightly, I outweighed her by a good 60kgs) steered her away from the line and towards a few of her friends. \n\nSo she rounds on *me* and pegs me one right in the nuts. Hard enough to make the male onlookers cringe, but I take it like a boss, admittedly crying on the inside a little. \n\nShe lines up the second kick, to which I stoop over a bit and catch her ankle. She hops on the one foot a few times, inevitably falling on her arse again, albeit gentler as I'm still holding her leg and an able to lower her slower than the initial fall. Let go of her ankle, help her friends get her up, so what does she do?\n\n*She does it again, with the same result.*\n\nEventually her friends walk her around the corner to a waiting car. And I could get some ice for my nads. Fast forward an hour or so, a a black customised Skyline pulls up out the front of the club, and the front passenger calls me over. I glimpsed pink in the backseat through the illegally dark window tinting, figured it was the boyfriend looking for payback. My two Doormen staunch up, having come to similar conclusions. \n\n'So you like hitting chicks, C#nt?' \n\n*'Wouldn't know sir, I've never hit a chick in my life.'*\n\n*Bullsh#t* the chick screams from the back seat. \n\nCalling my 2IC over, I asked him to walk the gentleman to the camera room to view the footage (we were pretty relaxed about as we knew the local police fairly well if things hit the shit). I noted the guys licence plate and posted on door.\n\n The guy walked out, pissed off after seeing his girl (I presume) act like the drunken Twat she was, 10 minutes later. I calmly told him to make sure that it is known to all in the car, including Princess, that if any damage occurred to the venue overnight that her credit card from the booking would be charged for it, and if the car or any inside were seen in the area again that weekend the tint and lowering job would be reported to Police.\n\nNeedless to say, didn't see either of em again.\n\nGentlemen, Ladies.\n*bows* *^tips ^hat*",

        "text": "Was directed over here from another sub, posted this a week or so ago and thought y'all might enjoy this. It's a bit long, though worth the read for any security personnel.\n\nWorking as a bouncer in a quiet gaming room tonight whilst struggling with my fifth day of being off cigarettes so I'm pretty edgy. A young hipster chick comes up to the bar and asks me; \n\n'*what goes with a Liquorice liqueur?*' \n\nI'm a Single Malt Scotch man, so I'm not too sure. I reply with, \n\n'Not sure, when in doubt try soda water I suppose.'\n\nShe then turns around and orders a pint of the cheapest beer for her equally cheap looking friend, and a *soda water.* at this point I'm thinking to myself, *nah, she can't be THAT stupid!* Well sure enough, her friend with the beer goes to the table whilst Soda Hipster *(Man, I gotta trade mark that, good indie band name)* goes directly to the toilets, returning a minute later with that murky blue Soda Water / Black Sambuca combo. \n\nHow stupid do you think I am girl, really? \n\nSo, I hover close enough to glean snippets of the conversation they were having; plans of where to go from there, involving going to get refills at the bottle shop and hitting a club, both of which are nearby, and happen to be guarded by good friends of mine in the Security Industry. I duck into the adjacent smoking room and snap a pic of them, plan forming. \n\nI then 'clean up' around their table, when I accidentally (air quotes) bump her drink, sending it flying over her white cloth bag and phone. I immediately apologise, and offer a replacement. Part one in action.\n\nGoing to the bar, I pour another Soda Water. When I put it down in front of her, she genuinely looks puzzled, telling me she ordered a Sambuca and Soda. To which I reply that she had in fact ordered a soda water, self served her own alcohol into said drink (illegal here to clarify), and that once she finished her Soda she could leave the venue as she wouldn't be served anymore. She informed me that she didn't know it was illegal to do that, to which I replied if you didn't think it was, why do it in the toilets so no one could see you? No response, so I walk away, telling the staff what happened. \n\nPart two involved me sending that pic to the venues the two hipsters (who had been joined by equally hipster BF's) were going to after here with a request to refuse Service / entry to Soda Hipster^TM. \n\nAround 10 minutes later, she goes to the bar and asks for another soda water. I calmly reiterate that she can't be served anymore, to which she says with a smile 'Thanks, you 'Ranga cunt!' (Non Aussies: 'Rang-a' = 'Ginger') And walks away, obviously happy with this insult. Pfft, I get called that and *worse* daily. Anyway, I send a follow up text to the venue bouncers asking that when they knock her back, tell her 'Courtesy of the Ranga Cunt.' \n\nWhen her friends try to buy more drinks, I have informed the staff to refuse them, and to say 'Courtesy of the Ranga Cunt' as well, just for a laugh. \n\nAfter a few attempts, Soda Hipster^TM storms out with her obviously embarrassed friends. As the bottle shop and club are literally on the same block as I with the bottle shop a few stores from the entrance to my venue, I walk outside, texting a third time that the group are leaving my place. I can see the doorman, Big Dev, down the road at the bottle shop check his phone, then stick his thumb up in the air without looking at the group.\n\nThe group arrive at the bottle shop and Soda Hipster^TM is refused service. I can tell when Dev said the punch line as he bowed slightly before she spun and stared back in my direction, to see me giving a casual wave. At least her boyfriend found it funny by the look of him. So they disappear around the corner to their second destination, only to return around 5 minutes later, heading towards me, whilst the venue Manager and myself are pissing ourselves laughing at Soda Hipster^TM storming ahead of the pack.\n\nShe pulls up at my door and angrily demands my name. I inform her that by law I can only give her my Security Tag number. So she wants to talk to the manager. The VM steps in and says that I had done everything in accordance to the law and that if I said anything to other bouncers to help them in their duties that I was able to do so as its my choice, not his. Frustrated, she now wants the manager to get my boss down here. I feign surprised horror at the suggestion, then defeat, telling the VM to grab the company business card from the security register. \n\nAs he is doing so, Soda Hipster^TM is standing there with a smug grin and crossed arms, saying things like *you're fucked now, there goes your job* etc while I try my best to look ashamed. The boyfriend is clearly amused by the situation, but also torn between being on his GF's side of the matter as well. Been there, done that buddy. \n\nThe VM returns and gives Soda Hipster^TM the company business card, to which she pulls out her phone and starts dialing the after hours number. Idly, I turn to her boyfriend and ask him if he likes magic tricks. He looks confused.\n\nThe intro to *Murmaider* by Dethklok emanates from my pocket. I whip out my phone and theatrically ask the BF;\n\n'Is ***THIS*** her number sir?!?'\n\nGuess Soda Hipster^TM didn't realise it was my company, but at least he saw the humour in it.\n\n**UPDATE:** so now she is sending abusive texts, I'm replying to each one with [this.](http://i.imgur.com/V3B0iVV.jpg)",

        "text": "One of my favorite gigs to work was a bar called OC17, at the Oceanfront on 17th street. Clever, right?\n\nThe bar was owned by two friends that grew up together. They came from families that rented small houses one street apart a few blocks from the oceanfront, and hence had always been a part of beach culture. They were very mellow men until they got to drinking.\n\nThey started off with a landscaping business that allowed them to surf full time and work part time. They started with two push mowers, a riding mower, a crappy weed whacker (or trimmer, depending on your locale) that they hauled around on a tiny open-top trailer pulled by a 4Runner. From there, they grew their business, made investments together, and lived the life they dreamed of living. One of their heavy investments was RedHat, and they chose it because they favored Linux (an open-source OS) over Windows products. I guess they just liked the idea of free enterprise. Ironic that they invested into a *company* for that, but it worked out well for them. They did a short sale on their stock after it took off and used that money to buy the place they turned into OC17.\n\nThis bar was great. Just off the main strip, lots of good food places around, and a hop skip and a jump from warm sand and salty waves. \n\nThey liked to hire relaxed, gorgeous women who were intelligent, collected and had that *je ne sais quoi*. They had this really smooth way of bringing in the right clientelle to breed a laid back atmosphere. There were rarely ever fights there. The main reason we were contracted was to create a 'presence' and check ID's. Places were really getting popped for 'accidental' underage drinking. \n\nMy buddy from the previous story ('Billiam', AKA Billy) had worked there a few times and spoke well of it, so on nights he worked and I didn't I would visit and have a drink or two. I didn't know the owners frequented their own bar, and when I got there early one night there were two guys drunk off their asses and causing problems. I could tell the bartenders, both very sweet and laid back women, were uncomfortable but didn't want to say anything so I approached the two guys. This was in my White Knight days, so I felt *obligated* to help because I could. I calmly but firmly asked them to quiet down and quit causing a ruckus because they were making the staff and patrons uncomfortable. The glassy-eyed man on the left coyly asked if I felt I could make him. I told him that I could but wouldn't, and preferred to talk him out the door rather than throw him out. He seemed surprised by this and soon enough we were laughing and joking together. I was stunned by how cool they were despite being an unwelcome distraction. \n\nBilly walks in wearing his security shirt and says hello to 'Heather', a bartender he was sweet on. He looks over at me and his smile fades. He approaches and says, \"I see you met *this* dickhead\" gesturing to me. It's at this point they reveal that *they* are the owners. We three started laughing and had to explain the situation to Billy, who made jokes about me \"headhunting\" his job. \n\nOne one particular night, Billy lost his post there because the owners were upset on how he treated a customer. He had anger issues at times, and I had learned to calm him down over our tenure as friends. Unfortunately, I wasn't there. When he denied a guy access because he didn't have ID, the guy claimed racism and made a scene before he walked into the alley. The alley is a shortcut not often used by most people who prefer to stay on the well-lit main streets. This alley had the side entrances (typically for employees or food/alcohol deliveries), and so the guy snuck in the side entrance. One of the bartenders brought it to his attention, and instead of handling it calmly he walks up behind the guy and slams his head into the table of the booth he was sitting at. The guy had made a huge scene and tried to provoke Billy into a fight when he was refused entry, but he had no cause to slam the man's head like that. He then 'helped' the man out the door and the police picked him up soon after. \n\nThe owners heard about the incident, called our boss and almost dropped our company as security. After sending Munn out for two weeks, they had to put him back at Fahrenheit because they were a huge client for us (they employed Munn and 4 other guys, 4 nights a week and 3 guys the other 3 nights). They said they would keep us if I could handle their security. I had impressed them and we had a few nights of drinking together on the nights we both showed up to OC17. \n\nA lot of places had dress codes, like no undershirts or you had to have a collared shirt, etc etc. Well, these guys didn't care as long as no one drove other customers away. One girl tried to get me in trouble because I was letting in a lot of people from the 'urban' club across the street. Her whole reason was because they failed to tip. While it sucks you're not making much off them, the business was and that's why I was there. I don't like discrimination, and had refused to work at a previous venue because of it. So the owners sat me down and talked to me about it and I explained my side of it. *They fired the racist bartender*. I was fucking ecstatic at how down to earth these guys were! They didn't want anyone racist working for them, and felt like if she wasn't racist she would have asked me to keep out the local regulars that didn't tip who were mostly of the caucasion persuasion.\n\nThey hired another bartender, and she was amazingly sexy. She was a firecracker who grew up with three brothers, and could drink, swear and fight toe-to-toe with the best of them yet still be ladylike. She also liked to drink and cut up, and one night she came in on her night off and got plastered. I offered to call a cab so she didn't have to drive and she got pretty shitty with me, which was a surprise to everyone in attendance. Three steps out the door, she trips and hits the curb. She's facing away and yells out at my approach to leave her be. I ignore her threatening plea and approach to see her two front teeth laying on the sidewalk. *She had knocked out her two fron teeth*! I collected them for her, went inside and quietly got her friends, and they drove her to the hospital. She had to get stitches on the inside of her lips, and she took a week off. She came back with a bridge with two super-white fake teeth, and had to wait two months to save up enough to get permanents done. She had a pretty good sense of humor about it though, and would charge people $20 who wanted to see her without her fake teeth in. She was pretty hilarious and open about it. \n\nOne night a week, we had a radio station come in and host a party live. It was a 'College Night' on a weeknight, and sometimes we had very few people. The DJs were cool, and had been friends for a few years. She was a badass cutie named Elena that was thick and very confident. She would have been sexy without the confidence, but that just made her next-level sexy and I loved to flirt with her. The other DJ was a funny ass dude named Chris, and he loved to flirt with me as much as I loved to flirt with her. He kept trying to make me uncomfortable, but it never worked because he had boundaries. On a particularly slow night, we had a guy come in and was making fun of 'Chris' because the guy said \"*he talks funny*\". Chris was just very eloquent and his voice was a little high pitched for a male. The guy thinks I will take his side in persecuting Chris because of some imagined 'Bro Code' that's pro-gay-bashing. I looked him straight in the face and asked him if he was gay. He disgustedly said no, so I asked him if he'd ever had sex with a man. He responds with an aggressive \"HELL NO!\" and sizes me up. I smiled at him and said, \"*How do you know you're not gay if you've never tried it? I had to fuck a guy twice before I realized I didn't like it.*\" This guy was floored and made silly, disjointed comments while he paid his tab and left. Chris needed to relax and mention smoking a bowl. I smoked a little bit, and had some in my car so I invited him out. He invited Elena, and so I took my break when they had a long run of songs in between their hosting duties and we smoked a bowl in my car. I hit it once and let them smoke the rest so I could keep my head clear. I used to only like catching a little buzz anyway, never getting super stoned. We start talking about the incident with the ignorant asshole, with Elena expressing how cool it was of me. We're laughing, cracking jokes on the guy and Elena and I are flirting heavily. What followed was kind of strange at first, but after she started sucking my dick the worry that Chris was in the backseat dissolved. I almost went soft because he was watching us, but then I just closed my eyes and let it happen. She swallowed, I zipped back up and made sure I was decently flaccid, and we headed back in to finish up the night. Elena and I had a short fling after that, but I think she considered herself a '*Rolling Stone*' and didn't want a boyfriend. We kept it casual and another man soon had her attention. I wasn't even mad. Chris would text me for months after and come have a drink or two wherever I was working. It never failed that he had one or two beautiful women in tow, but I never tried to hook up with any of them and he soon thanked me for that. He said most straight guys try to abuse his friendship to exploit his female friends. Not my bag.\n\nAs things often do in the winter, business at the oceanfront slowed down. Locals kept the doors open, but barely. The owners had been undercut by other landscapers on some of their contracts, and running two businesses was taking it's toll on them physically, mentally and financially. They were looking at having to close the bar if things didn't turn around, and one night they decided to really party it up. They were always loud and mildly obnoxious when they got drunk, but that night they were in rare form. Shots and shooters flowed, and after we closed they wanted us to drink with them. One of the bartenders (Ms Fake Teeth) had plans at an after-hours club with friends, but the other bartender ('Heather') and our waitresses stayed and we all got pretty drunk. I quit after I got a buzz because I had a 25 minute ride home and I don't like drunk driving. I knew I had time to sober up, and I felt like the owners were getting out of control. First, it started small. Accidentally tip a chair over, and so they flipped a few chairs over, \"*Fuck this chair! Whoo!*\". One owner had Heather make a bunch of Soco&amp;Limes, and threw his glass against the wall after taking it, prompting the other owner to do the same. They threw ours and that was that. They high fived each other like what they did was awesome, and start playing darts. They are sloppy drunk and suck hobo ball sack, so the one that instigated the glass breaking implies the dart board is to blame, so the other owner rips it off the wall and flings it discuss style into another wall, denting the drywall. Things keep winding up and they start arguing and are all on each other, but things haven't become aggressive yet. I step in and diffuse them by redirecting them to talking about surfing and they start teasing each other about who is the better surfer. One owner goes to the bathroom and on his way out doesn't turn the handle far enough, so he slams into the door he expected to open. He kicks it open, loosening the hinges. At this point I break out my cell phone and take a crappy video on it as they kick the door closed and keep kicking it to try to straighten it back. This turns into 'destroy the door'-fest as they kick it, punch it, slam it closed and open it all the way. The video isn't that great, it's only 15 seconds long (the limit for my flip phone at the time) more or less just proof they did it. Then they entice me to do it because I'm \"*a big motherfucker*\". So I break the door up a bit and we laugh a little harder. I figured why not, the door had to be replaced at that point anyway. I left it alone after a few hits and let them destroy it and hurt themselves. The waitresses leave, and Heather and I try to clean it up but the owners knock some pieces I'm picking up out of my hand and tell me to leave it for them tomorrow. So we do. I get a text from them the next day asking about the condition of the bar, so I send over the video of them destroying the door. That jogs their memory and they replace the door themselves and put up a picture over the dent in the drywall that same day. They send the video to a few of their friends, and by that night it had gone viral locally. People had sent it and resent it to all their friends, which brought a lot of people in. Some people were rowdy, but I kept decent order without being shitty. I just had to explain that if someone owned something, they could destroy it but others couldn't. They drank, they laughed, the owners pulled aside the painting and told the story about the dart board. Business picked up for a while, and surprisingly turned the bar around. People wanted to be at a place where shit happened, you know? So they made it through that season and stayed open till summer came around and money really started rolling in. \n\n***I think they ended up selling the bar after they almost closed again, and I have seen a big truck pulling an enclosed trailer with their logo on it since, so I think they cashed out of the bar business and focused on landscaping. If you do it right, both can be lucrative. But I think it's too much to keep up with both.***",

        "text": "I used to work at this huge outdoor pool in my hometown as an overnight guard. I had to maintain the chemicals, water level, clean, etc., but the biggest job was guarding the pool overnight against fence hoppers after hours.  I was alone the entire time, without backup, but it was usually just stupid kids most of the time.  This is the only noteworthy story I have (aside from a frog jumping into the pool, causing me to chase it for 3 hours with a skimmer) since I only worked there for one summer, so enjoy!\n\nOne night I was in the office around 3AM when I heard a splash. I look outside and see nothing. Soon I heard more splashes and went out to investigate. Turns out there was a couple of 13-15 year old black kids skinny dipping in the pool I couldn't see under the veil of night (not racist, just how eyesight works). So, I went to the edge of the pool without them seeing me as they approached the edge, looked down, and said, \"Boo!\" They screamed like a shark bit their prepubescent dicks off and ran out and hopped the fence screaming, \"Fuck the pool nigga let's go!\"\n\nOnly thing is, they forgot their clothes on the ground. So I got a good laugh that night thinking of the two naked black kids running all the way home. I then threw out their clothes.\n\n**tl;dr** I caught 2 kids skinny dipping in the town pool, and scared them so much they ran home and forgot their clothes.\n\nQuick extra story for shits and giggles: My friends thought it would be funny to light fireworks outside the pool one night, which sucked since I had to clean them all up. I doused some with water to prevent them from exploding, but some got into the pool. Silver lining: on the way home my friend got his first speeding ticket. The end.",

        "text": "So I'm not a security guard, but this run in involved a security guard.\nI was in graduate school and as such stayed in my office many late nights grading/researching/etc.  The security guards (may have technically been cops, but overall functioned much more like security guards) were based out of the basement of the building I was in and so coming and going I'd see them pretty regularly and knew most of them by sight.  At night there'd usually be one or two in the office and two of them would patrol campus (small school) pretty much just walking the halls to make sure there were no disturbances.\n\nOne guy who worked security was from somewhere in the Balkans originally and had a very thick accent.  He was a very friendly guy.  One night I'm working late and had to go to the printing room on the other end of the floor to print stuff out.  As I'm walking, I hear something coming from one of the other rooms, it sounds like music.  It's a room that I had thought was storage.  Someone is singing in a very loud voice along to the music.  I crack the door to see what's up and I'm suddenly hit with:\n\nBENNNNYYYY BENNNNYYYY BENNNYYYYY an de CHETS!\n\nThis security guard was belting his heart out just singing along to \"Benny and the Jets\".  He noticed me, and waved.  After the song was over he told me that his friends (maybe some of the other security guys too) liked to do karaoke and would tease him for not singing so he wanted to pick an American song and learn it so he could sing karaoke.  So he'd been sneaking up there on breaks to practice singing Benny and the Jets so he could surprise them one week.  We sat and chatted a bit and he asked me to critique his performance before he went back to work.\n\nA few weeks later he stopped in the office to show me a video of him doing karaoke, and it actually sounded pretty good.  I could never say this guy's name correctly and after this his name, in my head, became Benny.",

        "text": "So this happened on a particularly crazy night, and is a violent story. If you don't want to read violence, please move on. This is the only disclaimer you'll get. Honestly though, it's not THAT bad. \n\nI am working at Fahrenheit again, and my long-time buddy \"Billiam\" is working with me. We're both big guys, and we've worked out together since we became teenagers. We both like to laugh and cut up, but we both have tempers that are slow to start but burn white hot once they're stoked. I always did more cardio than Billy and I have a background in martial arts, whereas he learned his skills from a rough neighborhood. \n\nAnyway, on to the story.\n\nIt has been a rough night. Billy is working with me, along with a guy we'll call Paul. Paul is there for the 'respect' (ha!) and the girls. He has no interest in diffusing situations and is pretty inattentive aside from oggling women. Most women saw through his charade and he was a bit of a joke to them. Not all, just a majority. We had a few incidents that night already, and Paul had been nowhere around. He was either in the back, or on the other side of the bar. We had no problem with it, nor did it stand out that he was avoiding issues. Besides, Billy and I were more than happy to do our jobs at that time in our lives.\n\nAn incident arises at the bar where two guys are in each others' faces and people have backed up. No big deal, we usually have two or three scuffles a night. Nothing major, and it is pretty easily resolved by either talking to the potential combatants or simply tossing them out, literally or figuratively. Billy gets there first and I am there right after, and we each choose one guy to focus on to distract them from each other. Unbeknownst to us, they knew each other very well and came together along with three of their friends. They're at the stage of intoxication where they're still cognizant and just starting to feel a little bit like Superman (Supermen?). I can hear the guy behind me raising his voice at Billy and getting confrontational. I see the guy in front of me widen his eyes and try to rush past me. I stick out my arm, but he keeps going and reaches out for Billy, who is tussling with his buddy. I twist his arm behind his back, bring him up on the balls of his feet and hold him there. His buddy swings at Billy and connects.\n\n**Billy has always had a trigger**. If you hit him in the face, he kind of blacks out. Or loses control and has selective memory of his actions... However you want to look at it. Billy pushes his guy backward against the bar and another guy comes up behind him and I see two more coming at me. At the same time my guy grabs *my freaking ear* and starts pulling hard. He was on the balls of his feet leaning back towards me with one arm behind his back, so I accepted this was going to hurt and slammed him on the ground. He let go on impact as the air rushed out of him, and I stood to face the two rushing me. I hear Billy mixing it up just out of my peripheral vision, but my focus is on the two in front of me. They move in like they're going to try to grab me and subdue me, but my martial arts background kicked in, quite literally. I chambered my knee and kicked the closest guy in the solar plexus and he trips up on the guy on the ground and goes down beside him. His other buddy had to go around them, so as the guy I kicked went down I focused on combatant number three. He came around his prone buddies at an odd angle for him, so the first few blows in the exchange were mine. He backed up and his eyes flickered over to his buddy getting up off the ground. I can tell the prone guy getting up is going to go for my legs, so I turn and kick him in his head. In return, I take a few hits from the guy standing before I get my guard back in place. I hit him twice then get my arms in his armpits and drive him backward until he falls into a booth, effectively out of the fight for the moment. I use my quick breather to scan around, and good ol' Paul is standing at the edge of the crowd, being just another spectator. I yell at him to get involved, but he is just staring at Billy. Billy has one guy down and is making the mistake of boxing the other guy. I can see Mr. Solar Plexus is going to charge Billy from behind and blindside him, so I charge in to intercept and we slam into the bar with him taking most of the blow. Being that I was ~260lbs and solid, he slumps to the floor out of the fight. The guy on the ground is just coming around and is scrambling to get a footing. He reaches for a stool and swings it wildly at me. I managed to catch it, but sprained two fingers in the process. I snatch it out of his hands and crack the seat of the stool down on his foot. He lifts the foot and I slam him again in a judo-esque throw. He hits hard and I can tell I knocked the wind out of him again. I turn just in time to see Billy slam the guy's head whom he was boxing into the bar. He crumples to the floor as I'm walking over, and just as I get there the crowd parts and Munn walks up. In case you didn't read Pt 1, Munn is a huge redheaded Irish weightlifter. He is a few inches shorter than I am (I'm 6'1\"), but he is like two of me in size. At least in terms of muscle. Munn, Billy and I each grab a guy and start escorting them out. I grabbed the guy who I knocked the wind out of, Billy grabbed the first guy he tussled with, and Munn simply grabbed the guy who got his head slammed in the bar by his leg and unceremoniously dragged him out onto the sidewalk. We come back and the guy who I plastered into the booth is being helped out by his friend, and they assist each other out. Escorted by us, of course. \n\nWe walk back in to applause and praise for the 'good show'. One girl came up and kissed Billy. I don't mean a kiss on the cheek, either. She grabbed him and put a hurting on his lips. We make sure that everything is smoothed over, and we rebuff Paul's attention and walk back out front with Munn. We tell him what happened and asked him if he could look after the bar for a minute, we had something to do.\n\nFor those not aware, in any type of security detail you watch your co-workers' backs. Yeah, you may all get beat up, but you have to have that camaraderie and trust. You have to know that you're all willing to go to bat for each other, or the dynamic doesn't work. \n\nBilly walks through the back door and leaves it open. It leads to a mostly private alley. There are offices on the 2nd and 3rd stories of these old buildings, but they close around 5 or 6. So the alley belongs to us at night. I ask Paul to accompany me so we can talk, and I lead him out there. We initially were just going to talk to him, let him know the deal and of his betrayal by not stepping in. He infuriated me with his bumbling answers and excuses. I told him flat out if he was just here for some easy pussy (a crass way of putting it, I know, but I was angry and my wording was mean to devalue him, not women), then he should turn in his shirt and start buying women drinks instead. He realizes he fucked up and instead of apologizing and correcting the behavior, he tells us to go fuck ourselves and pushes Billy to get past him. Billy pushes him hard, and Paul flies into me. I stabilize us, and just as we get our balance back Paul knees me in the nuts. At this point, Billy and I gave up on words. We whooped Paul's ass up and down that alley, then told him he was going to go back inside and finish his shift. AND if anything else went down, he was going to be in the forefront handling it. He threatened to call the cops on us, so we told him to go ahead. We knew all the cops that worked that beat, and they would take our word over his. Which is the truth, and he knew it. So he went back inside and we left him at bathroom duty in the back the rest of the night. He had to sit on a stool and make sure no one took drinks into the restroom or opened the door to let their friends in the back (the alley where he got his ass whooped). \n\nThe next day, Angel, the owner of the company we worked for, called Billy and I to meet with him before our shifts. We explained to him what happened, and were truthful about how it went down. Angel shook his head and we talked a little shit about Paul. He called in two guys to cover our shift so we didn't work around Paul that night, and then he transferred Paul to a hole in the wall bar by himself as a glorified ID checker since he couldn't work well with others.\n\nPaul lasted two weeks after that before he quit because he wasn't being 'used to his potential'. Which means he wanted to have it easy in a place where he could hit on beautiful and/or drunk women. The owner of the biker bar he worked at told Angel not to send him \"some punk ass puke still suckling at his mommy's titties\".\n\nWe didn't see Paul any more after that.",

        "text": "I used to work security at the two main places we have clubs, downtown and the oceanfront. I loved working security because I have always been a night owl, and the extra money was great. An added perk is that a lot of women love to hit on or tease security/bouncers. \n\nI was working one night at a club called Fahrenheit. It was a nice place in an upscale part of downtown, and was a long and narrow club that had been converted. The bar was on the right, the kitchen towards the back, but you had to walk in a hallway past the kitchens to get to the restrooms located in the back. We had a policy that men could not lock or close the door. It was set up to where that wasn't a problem because no one was visible without entering. There was also a rule that no drinks were allowed in the bathroom. To ensure these rules were followed, there was a stool and a small table by the restrooms for security to use. Sit on the stool, make sure people don't take their drinks in, etc etc.\n\nOne night, I am taking my turn in the back watching the people going to the restroom. We're at capacity, as usual, and everyone is getting pretty intoxicated. Two people had already been thrown out. There's a line into the hallway for the men's restroom, which is abnormal. A tall husky man walks past the line, and many men gesture at him to me as if he's cutting. I put my hand out and tell him there's a line, but he says he just needs to talk to his friend. He yells into the bathroom, \"Yo, we need to go dawg. Shiz abat to git rull!\" He flashes me a dirty look and turns back down the hallway. A co-worker, we'll call him Andy, is right there and he's pissed.\n\nAndy: \"Hey man, I just got done talking to the girl you threw your drink on. That's a dick move.\" The guy starts denying it until Andy tells him he *saw* it, and he just talked to the girl first. We always had a policy that our guests had to treat the ladies with respect, and any lady that was not being ladylike was promptly escorted out. Well this guy bought her a drink and was trying to get her number. When she accepted the drink but would not give her number he flipped out, grabbed her drink and threw it in her face. Andy continues laying into the dude, \"What kind of piece of shit does that? So she isn't interested. So what? No one, not even you, would turn down a free drink. What the fuck man? Are you even a man?\"\n\nThe guy is obvious getting more and more riled up. They both are. Andy was being a little presumptuous and cocky, thinking that the guy who was at least half a foot taller than us wouldn't cause a problem. This guy's about 6'6\", and husky... So I'm going to be ready for anything. I am perched on the stool with my feet on the rungs, ready to pounce. This guy stares Andy down and is muttering about this and that while rubbing his face. I knew he was baiting Andy in and trying to decide how he was going to fuck Andy up. I see it an *instant* before he acts. I launch off the stool as he rears back with his left hand to punch Andy. Andy ducks back as I come crashing into this guy and pin his fist against his back, with his elbow going over my shoulder. My weight (a very solid 260 at the time) pulls the guy backward and off balance, and I clamp down on his arm and neck to the point where I know he will pass out if he struggles much. I kick the back of his leg for good measure, and keep my knee close to his ass to brace him so he doesn't take the struggle to the ground. Andy hits him in the stomach once, and I tell him if he does it again, I'll release the guy. Even though Andy is technically the head of security, I had control of the situation and told him to clear the path out front. I tell the guy he can either walk out or be 'softened up' and thrown out, then summarily arrested by the many officers that patrol the street. They're usually off duty but in uniform, paid by all the clubs in case shit really goes down. \n\nAnyway, he's leaned back and I'm walking him out. I can tell his adrenaline is pumping, but the grip I had on him made him my bitch and it didn't help that blood flow was partially restricted. About halfway through the crowd, through anger and embarassment, he manages a wild, glancing strike at my face with his free hand. I was mad that he'd try that crap and he was very close to catching my eye with a fingernail. So I roughly force him the rest of the way out and just before we get to the door, I kick his leg to drop him to the floor and throw him face first into the door. ***BLAM*** Shit goes quiet. I open the door and loudly exclaim \"Oops!\" in the false-innocence voice that clearly stated to all that were paying attention that it was, in fact, intentional. Now we get to Munn.\n\nMunn was an independent security guy that knew the owner of Fahrenheit. He's a wide Irish bodybuilder that is like TWO of me. My height, but *much* more muscled. He turns around from talking with Andy to see the guy I'm essentially dragging through the doorway. The guy probably had about 40 lbs on me, and was groggy from meeting the door so abruptly. Munn laughs, and grabs the guy like a sack of potatoes and starts carrying him off. The guy tries a few aborted slaps and wrestles with Munn a bit, so Munn just twists his massive trunk of a torso and throws the guy into the gutter. \n\nI shake Munn's hand and we watch as police come over and question the guy. At this point, a hot young lady with a wet dress comes out of Fahrenheit and is visibly angry. There was a blood red aura around her or something, it was intimidating even for us. She explains what happened to the police and we corroborated her story. We talk her out of pressing charges, but then he gets cocky and beligerent so the cops decide to take him in for public intoxication. \n\nI walk back in and we ask the guy's friends if they plan on being any trouble, and they say no. I resume my seat, and got talked up by anyone and everyone who came to use the restroom until I got moved out to the post by the dance floor. I was still pumped and ignored a few women who came up and were dancing on me. I think it spurred them on to try harder to distract me. A girl asked me if I was always so aggressive as she bit her lip, and I got her number so we could 'discuss it over dinner'. \n\nThis was just one night, and I have many more stories if anyone is interested.",

        "text": "Over the years I have been fairly lucky in this department with one glaring exception.\n\nBack in high school I dislocated my left kneecap pretty badly.  It was so swollen that the MRI was returning questionable results.  At first they thought it was my ACL or meniscus.  It was extraordinarily painful and recovery was slower than I expected.  I didn't really complete the physical therapy I should have and ever since that knee has been troublesome.  Since the initial incident, I have had minor blowouts about once every 18 months.  The most recent one was last month and I am still experiencing some pain.\n\nThe worst one, though, had to be during what should have been a routine arrest.  One of our anchor stores was known for having a particularly odd LP department.  The boss was a complete douche waffle and the majority of the staff was strange.  \n\nOne of their stranger employees was let go right about the time I was hired.  I may have interacted with him twice, tops.  This LP department in particular had a serious pride/elitism issue with mall security.  I have no idea why since they were a \"hands off\" store and constantly were having us get involved in some of their more violent stops so they could say that we touched the suspect, not them.  I tried to minimize my exposure to their company, but they also had an agent who I swear is the only 10 I have ever seen in the wild.\n\nSo, a few months after the guy was canned, we are alerted to some kind of disturbance with an intoxicate person.  Lo and behold, it is the former LP agent.  Drunk as fuck.  Harassing customers and the like.  We go down and issue him a ban and tell him to bounce.  He complies with minimal complaint and we return to not working.\n\nSoon after that happened (same week, day maybe?) we run into him.  Usually we are pretty reasonable with our trespass policy since non-serious offenders take people off the floor and waste time.  Unfortunately he wasn't too happy and still drunk.  It was time for him to go in a less temporary fashion.\n\nHe starts mouthing off to my supervisor who still isn't 100% on board for the arrest.  The sup just keeps repeating himself, \"you need to leave, you need to leave,\" while I stand behind the guy to his left.  The drunk LP idiot keeps saying that he worked here and knows his rights and knows so-and-so and all the typical bullshit.  \n\nAt some point, he had removed a backpack from his back and set it in front of him at his feet.  It appeared as though he was getting ready for a fight, so I finally convinced my sup that he needed to be handled.  Surprisingly, the idiot was relatively accepting of this at first.  He put his hands on his head when instructed, and I went to cuff him.\n\nWe cuffed everyone the same way: palms out, thumbs up.  This made it difficult for them to fish something out of their pants, and allowed us to grip their fingers and squeeze if they got squirrely.  I had the guys hands just like that and went to reach for my cuffs.  But then he grabbed my thumb.  He had one hell of a grip.  I was unable to free my thumb, couldn't squeeze his hand, and he was holding on tighter and tighter.  It was really starting to hurt.\n\nHe ignored my demands to release it, and kept getting tighter, and returned to yelling at my sup.  Finally I just look at my sup and tell him that they guy needs to go to the ground.  My sup comes over to the guy's right to assist as I pull his hand up his back and try to force him on his knees.  Instead, the guy steps forward.  This makes me step forward.  I see that my step will land on the backpack.  I awkwardly step further.  Go for the throw.  Roll my left knee.  Fall to the ground in an excruciating ball of fail.\n\nEventually another guard shows up to assist as I limp off to the office.  I was immobile for about a week after that.  To make it worse, I signed up for an Easter shift (mall's closed, OT) and on my way in, the two guys I am relieving are on the roof above the entrance with a bucket of water.  I tried to hobble/sprint to miss getting hit, but just tweak my knee again and fall on the concrete. ",

I thought the employees had reached an all time low when people stopped parking in our lot because they had to follow a detour to get here. Today it was topped.\n\nI was told that the lights were out in one of the departments and have been without lights for a week. I thought this was strange since no one had informed security or facilities about an issue. So I went to check it out. I came upon a room with probably 30 or 40 cubes in it and it was completely dark save one or two lights that were on. So I walk around the room for a while looking to see if the bulbs were broken or something and didn't find anything. As I was walking out to do a report I thought to myself \"I'll just check the light switch I'm sure they have tried it but wouldn't hurt to check.\" So I flipped the switch, and like magic the lights came on, problem solved. No one had attempted a light switch for a week a WEEK!\n\nNothing will ever surprise me again. I should probably write a memo explaining how not to swallow your tongue next.",

        "text": "This isn't directly related to a job, but involved the people and tools I worked with while at a couple malls.\n\nA couple of the supervisors and guards became very close.  We had cliques you could say.  Ours was comprised of the people that could do their job with out any misunderstanding that they work with preserving the interest of the company as their main objective.  That might seem like a no-brainer to most of you, but we have all met those who think they are cops or are acting for the benefit of the community.  I, personally, hate those people.  They are a much larger liability than any they prevent.\n\nSo, four of us find ourselves one evening at guard #1's house.  It is me, guard #1, guard #2, and another supervisor.  The first thing we notice about #1's house, is that it is a way down a dirt driveway, up a hill, into the woods.  Very creepy.  The second thing is that his house is hospital sterile.  Model home clean.  For a bachelor in his late 20s, this seemed very bizarre.\n\nWe walk in with our 24 pack and set it down.  Opening bottles was awkward as we didn't know what to do with the caps or empties since we couldn't find a trash can.  #1 just gave us a funny look and told us anywhere was fine.  Strange.  We then point out the state of his apartment and explain our confusion.  #1 laughs and says he just likes it clean and takes us on a tour of the place.\n\nThis is where the marginally creepy escalates.  He has two bedrooms.  One is his master, and the other is his man cave.  In the master, he pulls out a box.  It is his collection of devices.  #1 was a perverted guy, but we weren't expecting the assortment of dildos, vibrators, whips, and batons.  He was very proud of his things, and spoke in great detail about which item he used on which girl.  Creepy.\n\nThe man cave wasn't much better.  On the walls were various beer signs and whatnot, the corner was home to a pretty nice drum set, but over by the window, pointed at some houses about a mile away, was a high powered rifle with a 50mm scope.  His explanation?  He would watch a woman in one of the houses change.  Yeah.\n\nAfter the tour, we sit down with the beer, put a movie on in the background, and talk for a bit.  Pretty soon, #2 gets kinda drunk and wants to pull out the box of toys.  Excitedly enough, #1 obliges.  As we are dicking around with the dildos, #2 progressively gets more drunk.  At one point, he is just sitting on the couch with his legs spread open and his head back.  I see my window of opportunity and act accordingly.\n\nI tomahawk a two or three pound rubber dildo right for his balls with deadly accuracy.  #2 immediately clutches his legs together and rolls backward on the couch howling in pain.  #1, supervisor, and I are all laughing hysterically, until #2 rolls too far and knocks a crystal vase off the end table.  It hits the floor and shatters immediately.  \n\nI have already rearmed myself with a second dildo.  I turn and look at number #1 who is fuming with a can of LEO OC spray in his hand.  #2 has a baton.  We stand staring at each other for a minute or so while supervisor slowly backs into the kitchen.  I know that this could easily turn bad on me since I instigated the breakage, but I was hoping that #1 was more angry at #2.  At the same time, #2 and I would benefit from taking out #1 first since he had the ranged weapon.\n\n#1 acts first and sprays the shit out of #2's eyes.  I make a break for the door saying I had to work early and it was nice to see them, sprinting to my car.  I hear people following me.  I don't stop.  I get into my car, lock the doors and put it in reverse.  #2 approaches the car and motions for me to roll down my window.  \n\nI crack the window maybe a half inch or inch and ask \"what\".  #2 produces the OC from his back pocket and before I can get the window up, shoots a stream through the crack and catches me in the eyes.\n\nI love spicy food.  I am currently eating pizza drowned in the extra hot Crystal's.  But this was different.  It was painful on a different level.  And garlicky.  The only thing I have ever experienced this bad was some wings I had a few weeks ago made with the [Trinidad Moruga Scorpion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoville_scale#Scoville_ratings_of_peppers) chili.  It was awful.\n\nBut I had to leave.  I forced my eyes open and fought back tears as I navigated down the long dirt driveway.  Right at the end was a convenience store.  I knew these stores didn't have public restrooms, but I though the clerk would make an exception given the circumstances.  \n\nAfter much difficulty explaining my situation across the language barrier, and the clerk threatening to call the police multiple times since he thought I escaped from them, I managed to get to his bathroom.  I washed my eyes out, bought a Gatorade, and drove home.  \n\nThree showers later the acid burn had dulled to a warm feeling.  I slept alright, but the effects were still noticeable in the morning.  Never, ever, again.",

        "text": "Thanks for the [positive feedback](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromsecurity/comments/1flgdw/yay_suicide_watch/ )! On to another insane security story. During my lengthy stint as a security guard I was living with my parents in my home town. Near my house there was a huge residential construction project going on with several dozen new homes in various stages of completion. I was hired to patrol that area over a summer around eight years ago, out of my (parents) vehicle (1994 dodge caravan) from early evening until the construction crews arrived in the morning. Most houses had multiple entry points, and there was very minimal lighting on the street- not to mention it was in a part of town near some very extensive trail networks enjoyed by travelers of all sorts.\n\nOf course, being the (18 y/o) professional that I was, I bought a 13\" color tv, inverter, and ps2 to enjoy in my van. Quite a few people were confused at the sight and sounds of me playing vidja games in the middle of a construction site in my van. Especially in the middle of the night when my interior was glowing like a glow-bug.\n\nSo anyways, I had keys for all the houses, and had to do a walkthrough of each one every night. It was incredilby dangerous, and I was usually walking on plywood wedged between 2x4s between floors- the drop from the main floor to the basement was probably the worst, as the basements were the last to finish, so it was just bare concrete at the foundation level.\n\nOne Sunday night I was playing gran turismo until about 3 a.m., and decided that I should probably stretch my legs, so went for a walkabout. I was on 12 hour shifts for the weekend and had been especially lazy over the preceeding couple weeks, and had really been slacking on doing regular patrols. \n\nWalking around I noticed tool marks on some of the unit doors. Although I was definitely noping the fuck out, I had my flashlight and cell, and wasn't worried about people sleeping inside as I couldn't hear anything, and it was a nice night out. Decided to do a walkthrough and determine if it was a recent entry. Pushed open the door, as the knob lock had been disabled- concerned with encountering squatters, before I entered I was sweeping my light across the room into the dark corners and interior doorways when I opened the front door. As soon as I stepped in I felt myself tip forward and start falling headlong into the basement. \n\nWoke up ten minutes later in the basement covered in blood. Someone had moved the temporary flooring immediately behind the front door. Had to crawl up through the 1/2 security windows at the rear of the building. Called the cops, and an ambulance. Someone had ripped the copper wiring out of half the houses in the development. Needed 20 stiches to my face and was in a cast for a broken wrist that I didn't know I had when I came to- crawled out with it busted. Luckily didn't get it worse that night. Still, got to work in a booth for the rest of the summer because of my injury. Booth story forthcoming, although it involves me getting fired for hotboxing the booth.",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromsecurity/comments/1flkoc/the_bear_mace_was_for_the_strippers_xpost_from/",
        "text": "I wasn't aware this subreddit existed, so I'm cross posting a story I originally placed in /r/TalesFromRetail\n***\n\nI was working for a strip club in downtown that was located by a set of train tracks that carried lumber throughout all hours. As you can imagine, this club was not \"high end.\" However, the club was known to be the place that for $167, the girls would do things that disproved Chris Rock's ode to the Champagne room.\n\nI had got a job at the club because my ex became a dancer here and ended up marrying the DJ, who was also the strongest guy I've ever met in my life. However, the years injecting steroids into his body took a toll and when he stopped working out, he blossomed into a massive individual who could only move because underneath 300lbs of fat, he was once 300lbs of pure license plate ripping muscle. Guy had a heart of gold, but my psycho ex got her claws into him for his money. I'm digressing.\n\nThe DJ this night was a big-for-nothing guy named Nachos, named as such because my aforementioned ex opened a food delivery joint (with her new husband's money) and named a heart stopping pile of nachos after him. It was me and one other bouncer, plus this mongoloid penguin of a man.\n\nOne of the strippers there was the product of the unique alchemy of a lifetime of daddy dick and CK1. A group of blinged out gangstas from The Drive came in, which was the weakness for said stripper. She let them touch her all over as they handed her singles, pretty much disregarding every rule in the book.\n\nNow, at this point you may be saying I should have pointed out they should have stopped, talked to them, etc. To you, I say go ahead and get in between a stripper riding a cocaine and ketamine high that I saw give a man over 20 stitches with a fishbowl margarita glass after he said he didn't like her cotton candy body spray (no, this was not at the bar she was working at). The night had been slow anyway and the way these guys were going through their stacks, I figured it would last a hour at the longest.\n\nWell, CK1 stripper takes one of the brothers in the back for a $25 lap dance (which came with a three minute hand job- who says chivalry is dead in the South?). I go to the bathroom real quick while another dancer came to the stage (who I kinda adored outside of work). Soon as she got within tipping range, she was immediately accosted by one of the two gangstas still at the stage area. She panics and steps back, waving over the other bouncer who we will call \"Harley.\" \n\nWell, Harley walks over and tells them to calm down right as I'm returning from the lavatory, to which they tell him \"fuck you.\" Mag light flashlights had become illegal at this point after a patron got killed by one in Georgia, so Harley motions over to me and I move up, telling them, \"Gentlemen, I apologize, but policy is that you cannot touch the girls. Let me get you a beer for your troubles if a dancer gave you a wrong impression.\"\n\nWell, honestly I got about halfway through that before one swung at me. \n\nNow, despite being a bouncer, I'm not the one that looks for a fight. I prided myself on talking people out of them and keeping them spending money in the bar. With that being said, I had been in enough scraps growing up being neither black nor white in South Carolina. Folks aren't good with fractions in the South. When you're darker than eggshell and lighter than sandalwood, both sides beat the shit out of you and try to punk you as often as possible. \n\nThe punch catches me in the forehead as apposed to my jaw or nose thankfully, merely giving me pause for a moment when Harley grabs the guy that's boxed me. I see his friend and honestly can't tell you if he was going to join in, but in this line of work, you protect your fellow bouncer or you don't have a job. I slapped on a naked lock (that's how I always knew it, someone has said it was similar to a hadaka or some sort of judo choke but I locked it in by grabbing the inside of my left elbow and grabbed the inside of his nostrils with my first two fingers on my left hand). Needless to say, we were now dragging both of these guys towards the door (which sucked ass because it was like a mini rat maze. [I drew this in paint to give you an idea.] (http://i.imgur.com/CctzF8h.png)\n\nWell, we weave our way outside when the guy who was getting his lap dance on finally joins us outside...along with CK1 stripper. Harley practically tosses the guy into the parking lot where I've also released my guy back into the wild after unhooking his nose like a bicornuated bass mouth. They begin popping off about how they are going to go \"beastmode\" on me (which I still say to this day). Lap dance gangsta goes over and begins yelling at his friends much to my surprise. I think to myself *Oh, this turned out better than I thought.*\n\nThat's when I hear Harley's motorcycle hit the pavement.\n\nEveryone jumps at the sound, I turn and see that CK1 is enraged that the gravy train was just thrown out and kicked over Harley's bike in fucking heels. HEELS. Harley's attempting to handle her and stop her from kicking his bike to pieces when the three gangstas apparently decided to start fist fighting in the parking lot. I guess they thought someone threw a chair? OK, not funny, moving on...\n\nSo now customers are outside watching the fight. People that are driving up are either turning around or stopping just outside the lot to watch this three-for-all. Here I am, knowing I need to bust up this fight before everyone leaves and the girls murder my ass for letting this go on and keeping the marks outside watching a fight. However, I'm not jumping in the middle of this and turning it into a three on one.\n\nI say *fuck it* under my breath and walk over to my car.\n\nLet's turn back to the beginning of this story. The ex of mine that was a dancer here had a brother I was good friends with. Being the funny man that he is, he bought me some $50 bear mace from a local camo bunker to \"fend off the strippers.\" I happened to have it left in my car. \n\nI open up the packaging and start reading the instructions while walking towards the melee. I finally remove all the safety plastic shit and line it up and press down on the release button. Now, I was expecting a stream or something. However, bear mace doesn't do that.\n\nIt comes out like a **fucking fire extinguisher.** \n\nI do a double take as I blast out this incendiary cloud, but the three gangstas practically seize up and hit the ground. They stopped mid swing, mid pants grabbing, everything and just hit the parking lot, emitting this pained mewling like water boarded kitty (the cat is a terrorist in this analogy, don't worry). They begin crawling away on the ground, sucking asphalt and yelling idiolect while I am dialing the police. As they are crawling, I slowly walk behind them and keep blasting it out in short controlled bursts. I finally got an answer.\n\n\"Hey Downtown, this is jbrake at [strip club]. I got three guys that were fighting in our parking lot needing pick-up. *pause* No they'r-- *sputter sputter* One second *shakes bear mace canister, begins spraying again* No they're pretty calm now but mostly because they can't see. *pause* Bear mace. *pause* Yeah, they aren't going anywhere.\"\n\nAnd now it's time for tragedy. \n\nI finally stop spraying because it touched my skin and set my hand on fire. I walk back towards the bar and see this massive crowd of customers that had just joined us or come from inside, some dancers included when I hear **CHOOO CHOOO** It never occurred to me what was going to happen at that moment, nor did it to the crowd or they would have been facing the direction I was.\n\nAs the lumber train passed by, the force of it's passing blew the lingering haze of bear mace death directly into the crowd. It was as though everyone was just disconnected from the Matrix, by being set on fire. I freeze for a moment then lower my head and walk inside to wash my hands midst screams of 'LAWSUIT, JBRAKE I'M GOING TO FUCKING MURDER YOU, MY TITS ARE BURNING!' It was the sort of agonized chorus saved for Lovecraft or a Fetlife meet-up. \n\nPolice showed up and took my statement. They asked if I had brought the bear mace to the club as a means to handle customers, to which I responded, \"No sir. The bear mace was actually for the strippers.\" I hoped you laughed at that, because he didn't. In fact, I am lucky that this occurred in an unrestricted pepper spray state or else I could have been in deep dookie.\n\nI never saw a lawsuit thankfully and the stripper who's tits had caught on fire was one of the few sane ones, so we ended up laughing about it while pouring milk all over her chest since that pretty much killed the bar for the rest of the night. She did a supreme pout face to guilt trip me though, so I paid for a lap dance as a way to say sorry. However, she decided to grab the back of my head and bury my face into her inferno tits for revenge, making me want to claw off my face. \n\nOh, CK1 was in the back the whole time getting high and stealing from the girls after Harley pulled her away from the bike. She still worked there when I left. Harley ended up dying on that bike a while later. My ex and the DJ broke up (thankfully, such a nice guy). Beyond that, not much more to this epilogue. \n\n***\n\nThanks for reading.",

        "text": "So, I was a guard for about four years for several different companies. My favorite postings were at shopping malls (overnights reading novels ftw!) or gate houses for factories. The absolute worst shifts I've ever had were suicide watch a local hospital, followed closely by ghetto apartment complex patrols.\n\nI'll start with the worst, because that's the best sort of story! I applied for a job as a guard because I was in school for police foundations (2 year college program). So I knew how to conduct arrests, use appropriate force, conduct safe patrols, you know, just enough to be in danger of thinking that I was a professional (at 18 y/o).\n\nGot stuck at a hospital for 12 hour rotating night / night / day / 2 off shifts- for minimum wage. My entire shift was sitting in a room with a person at risk for suicide to make sure that they didn't unplug their respirator, hang themselves, suffocate, or whatever. They basically just begged you to kill them or let them die for the entire shift. No headphones allowed. No reading. No anything, just watching. You weren't even allowed to speak to the patients, as staff didn't want to encourage guards to become attached to the patients (so we could be placed with whomever needed to be watched without wanting to visit our 'friends'). I'm sure you could imagine what 36 hours of listening to people begging to die for 3 straight days would do to you. Needless to say most guards only lasted a week or two at that posting before quitting. Even a deaf guy who we had there for a month or so quit because he could read the agony on their faces and in their body language. It's a good thing that we weren't allowed to befriend the patients, or the turnover would have been even worse- patients who didn't die from their conditions typically killed themselves between shifts, on breaks, or when guards dozed off.\n\nMany more stories coming. To tide you over, [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/mrkbm/im_sorry_james_its_all_my_fault/) is a nosleep that I wrote about a friend of mine murdered during my shift at a mall under construction.",

So I like to refer to my job as \"corralling rednecks\" (No offense to NASCAR fans, just the majority of the fans that are drunk, push the boundaries and get offended easy tend to be of the redneck variety.) I will use some names in my posts, but nobody you wouldn't hear about on ESPN.\n\nI have more than a few stories but this is one of my favorite funny moments. One day I was working near the side entrance to the Sprint Cup garage. During the afternoon we have a \"pre-race pit pass\" in affect that allows fans to walk through pit road and a little of the infield. I'm watching a make shift gate keeping anyone with the pre-race pit pass from coming through. As I'm standing there, two gentlemen approach and I let them know they can't go any further. Then Micheal Waltrip (back when he was still driving) in street clothes walks up behind them, stands around for a few minutes before passing through my gate. The two gentleman don't bat an eye.\nWell, the drivers start walking out of the garage into the driver's meeting tent, behind a barricade but in full view of the two gentlemen I referred to earlier. They start pointing and saying, \"Look, there goes Junior, and there's Greg Biffle!\". And then Micheal Waltrip comes out of the garage in the exact same clothes he was wearing before. One of the guys says, \"It's Micheal Waltrip!\" and then reality sinks in, \"He was just here!\".\nHe sure was guys, he sure was.",

Mirrors all around, direct line of sight down the aisles, centrally located cash wrap.  One or two people would be on at any time, and they would catch up to 14 shoplifters in a week.  Hyper efficient.\n\nWe would get called down there to issue a ban from the property to the offenders.  For the most part, the subjects would be cited out by the clerk using an online system, and be free to go on their merry way.  On occasion, though, the police would have to come down and do it for them.\n\nThis one time, the clerk caught three girls between 13 and 16 or so.  Because the younger ones didn't have ID, the cops had to come down to cite them out.  I went down with a new employee to show him the process and issue a ban.  It was me, another guard, a cop, two clerks, and three sobbing girls in the center of this shoebox of a store waiting for the girls' parents.  \n\nWe all start silently watching a girl in the back corner of the store.  She takes two or three trinkets and slips them into her purse.  Could not fucking believe it.  We watch as she turns around and bee-lines for the door.  Right as she crossed the threshold, the clerk addresses her, \"Are you serious?\"\n\nThe girl freezes, turns, walks back in, and the clerk has her sit down next to the other three.\n\nI guess she just figured everyone was too busy with the other girls that this was a better time than any.\n\n",

        "text": "One of the main malls I worked at was owned by a gigantic commercial property company that most Americans have gotten gift cards from.  For the most part, we were very lenient with some of our policies.  For those of you who do not know, the Bunny Ranch is one of the many legal brothels in the state of Nevada.  Unfortunately, this took place in Nevada's neighbor, California.\n\nSex at the mall was a regular occurrence.  I had had sex in the parking lot before I had worked there, and I had had sex almost everywhere before I had left.  Sex in the parking lot was a pretty normal thing.  Because of budgetary restrictions, we only had cameras in the lots.  When nothing was going on, our dispatchers were to watch those cameras.\n\nAround 16:00 one day, a dispatcher alerted me to an unusually parked vehicle in one of our lots.  It was unusual because it was a slow day, and it was parked far away from the building with many open spots closer.  \n\nI pull up in the small Ford SUV we had, perform a perfect vehicle approach and find that it was, to my initial observations of the heavily tinted windows, empty.  When I was about to return to the security truck, I looked back through the driver's window to the rear to see a... rear.  \n\nThere were naked people back there.  Normally I don't really give a fuck, but they didn't care I was there.  So, I knocked on the back door.  Now I could see through the tint and see a male figure railing out a pretty hot female.  No answer.  Knock again.  No answer.\n\nOn the third knock, the male gets off the female, turns around, and opens the door.  They just look at me waiting for a response.  I look at them thinking the intentions of my coitus interruptus is blatant enough.  We lock eyes for a minute, and then he speaks.\n\n\"What's up?\"\n\n\"Dude, you can't have sex here.\"\n\n\"Sorry.\"\n\nHe shuts the door and goes back to banging his cohort.  What?  I knock again.  He opens the door and looks pissed.\n\n\"What?!\"\n\n\"I don't care if you go to the park, a deserted road, a cheap motel or wherever, you just can't fuck here!\"\n\n\"Ugh... OK!\"\n\nBoth of them put on their clothes mumbling shit about the \"power-tripping rent-a-cop\", climb into the front seat and drive off.\n\nAnother time we were in the office watching a guy get blown in the front seat.  We had sent someone to deal with it, but they were on the other side of property and were taking a while.  We were still watching, and saw him supposedly finish.  When he did, he thrust both fists into the air in some kind of victory dance, and she lifted her head and wiped her lips.  Then they drove off.\n\nThe last one I can remember was similar to the second where an officer was too far away to do anything.  The guy was sitting in the passenger seat, and the girl was sitting on his lap really going to town.  We were dicking around with the cameras to get a better angle, when the dispatcher said she saw something move in the back seat.  We zoomed in as much as possible to see what she was talking about.  It was hard as the whole car was shaking.\n\nSure enough, we see a tiny little hand reach out from a car seat in the back.  WTF.\n\nWe used to keep all these clips in a special hidden folder on the DVR server; I am not sure if they still do.",

        "text": "This happened many, many years ago.  '75 or '76 if my old tired brain is accurate.  It involved a port runner on a bike, a sheriff's deputy, and a drunk pick-up truck driver.\n\nPort runners, for those of you who've never heard the phrase, are individuals who blow past checkpoints and border crossings.  They figure that they'll be long gone by the time law enforcement gets a chase organized.\n\nThis one particular late summer night a call went out on the radio that a bike had charged through the port of San Luis, Arizona.  Last seen heading northbound through Yuma County.  In the area was a deputy out on routine patrol. Our local officer knows the roads like the back of his hand, and surmises what could be the best route out of the area.  So he sets up along Highway 95 near Gadsden and waits.\n\nI need to tell you that back then the road had a VERY sharp right hand turn known locally as Deadman's Curve.  Our deputy was a sitting a few miles south of it.  And sure enough, here comes the bike.\n\nOur hero lights up the perp, who immediately throttles up to warp speed.  The deputy sees the guy's lights diminish in the distance, wink out, then sees a WHOLE lot of sparks and flame.  Deputy immediately calls for EMS, fire, and additional backup.  As he rolls up to the Curve he finds pieces of bike spread for a hundred yards or more.  Shit.  Crap.  Oh my God.  What a mess.\n\nCops are no different than anybody else.  Scraping the remains of a guy into a bucket is definitely not why they signed up for law enforcement.  So our deputy and his backup searched through the weeds and nearby orchard with some trepidation, not knowing what they'd find.\n\nWhat they found was..........nothing.  Spent over an hour combing the countryside and no rider was found.  WTF?  So while the accident investigation was still going on, they'd gotten a last known address from Dispatch according to the plate.  A deputy was sent into town.  He knocked on the door, which was opened by.........(wait for it).....the owner of the bike.  Now this guy was banged up, bruised, and was wearing assorted bandages.  When asked his story was that 'he went to a local bar, had a few drinks, and as he was leaving was confronted by unnamed individuals who proceeded to beat him up and steal his bike'.  He was given a ride home by a friend.  He didn't know where his bike was.\n\nThe interviewing officer wasn't buying this story, but had no direct proof that contradicted the complainant.  So our officer folded up his notepad, stuck it into his pocket and told the rider \"Well, if that is the story you are sticking with, I guess interview is over.\" \n \n\"But, hypothetically speaking, how might a bike rider escape from such a crash and make it safely home?  Any ideas?\"\n\n\"If we are talking hypothetical, here is what MIGHT have happened\" explained the biker. \"Let's say that the rider had left cop in the dust, and was still pulling away. Then let's say that he was looking over his shoulder to see just how far behind the cop had fallen.  An then let's have a guy driving down the road in an old dark pickup with his lights off, because he has been drinking.  Well, the biker MIGHT plow right into the back of the old pickup, and get tossed into the bed.  The drunk driver, feeling the impact and looking in his mirror, would see the pieces of bike flying through the air.\"\n\n\"The drunk MIGHT come to the conclusion that HE had just run down a biker.  In a panic he'd accelerate and get the hell out of there in a hurry.  So as he'd come into the outskirts of town, the biker MIGHT knock on his rear window and ask the drunk to drop him off at his house.  Yea, it could happen like that.\"\n\n\nThere is no postscript to this story.  I don't know if the biker was ever charged with anything.  And, unfortunately, I have no pictures to prove that this ever happened.  It was perhaps 38 years ago.  So I give it to you freely.  Enjoy it or not, as you see fit.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "So as some of you may know, a few years ago I worked at a very upscale private psycho hospital.  There was usually only one guard on duty at a time, unless a patient was known to be extremely violent.  \n\nSo one day I'm doing my patrols. It was a Sunday in December, and I was walking down to the end of one of the hallways, where a sort of open common room was.  Only one patient was in the area, a tall, bald man that had the build of a bear. Just without the fur.  I had never seen him before, and from the look of his bracelet, he had just been admitted within the last 24 hours.  He was sitting in a chair, watching a football game.\n\nI stopped for a moment to take a look at the score.\n\n\"Fucking Cowboys\"  said Ben the Bald Bear.\n\n\"HAR!  What's your team?\"  replied I.\n\n\"Giants.\"\n\n\"Ahh, I'm a Redskins fan\"\n\n\"Im sorry\" said Ben.  We had a laugh, and shot the shit for a little bit.  Talked about our teams and the seasons and such.  After a few minutes of conversation I said I had to complete my patrols, and said goodbye.  Ben said adios and resumed his watching.\n\nNow, a lot of times people were friendly, and it was the drugs.  Sometimes it was becase they simply didn't want to stay any longer. Othertimes, it was because they wanted to be on your good side so they could lure you into a false sense of security.  I made it a policy t be friendly, yet reserved with patients. Nothing too personal, and never shake their hands. Always fist bump.  I hate people who fist bump but it was a good safe way to be friendly.\n\nAnyways, throughout the day I do my patrols, and everytime I swing by Ben we chat about sports, women, cars, etc.  He seem's pretty normal, but that can be decieving in a place like this.  Eventually, he drops a bombshell on me.\n\nBen: You know, I'm only hear because of the government...\"\n\nMe: Yea?\n\nBen: Yea the fluoride in the water make me hear their radio transmission in my fillings.  They are communicating with aliens out of the Bermuda triangle.\n\nNow, the look on my face, must have given me away, because after 5 or so seconds of silence, Ben just starts laughing his ass off.  I'm a little nervous and start to back away.  That's when he holds his hands up and says,\n\nBen: I'm sorry I had to.  I know you get batshit people like that all te time. I'm just here to get away.\n\nThat's when he told me his story, which the nurses later confirmed.  About 10 years ago, he was a patient here.  His wife left him because of his drinking after Thanksgiving, and on Xmas Eve, his mother and sister died in a car accident.  A short time later in January, his brother killed himself.  Ben apparently fell into a severe alcoholic despression, and eventually came to the hospital for help.  That was a decade ago.  So why was he here now?  He had a glass of wine at Thanksgiving (which had just passed), and it reminded him of everything that happened 10 years ago. So he came here to just get away from the world, take a break for a week or two, and make sure he didn't fall into the bottle again.  \n\nBen was a great guy. If it was group time and a code happened, he would lead the patients in activites to disctract them while we handled whoever was acting out of hand. He was friendly and kind with everyone, and a lot of the patients were more eager to trust him than staff, so he could talk down someone easier than we could.  Guy had an excellent taste in movies and dirty humor, and was honestly the best person I knew there.  We talked when we could, and he was very encouraging about my goals of becoming a cop.\n\nI was sad to see Ben leave.  He was smiling and thanking everyone, and even had his brother in law, who picking him up, bring in a bouqet for the nurses and staff.  I stopped to say goodbye to him as he walked out the door, and offered my hand for a shake as I told him I hoped I didn't see him here again.\n\n**TL;DR- A man like a bear. Last name should have been Mormont**",

        "text": "Every once in a while, some idiot we would arrest would try and get out of it by offering various sex acts.  This was exclusively done by girls/women, most of which were extremely attractive.  Another pretty common event was people's shit accidentally getting broken during an altercation.  On this day, both kinda happened, except there was no attractive woman, and there was no accident.\n\nI forget the reason for the arrest, probably trespass, but we had some scrawny little effeminate black kid in handcuffs in the front part of our office.  I think there was another being detained in the back, and we were trying to keep them separated or some shit.  I don't know; many of these days have melded over the years.\n\nAfter this kid finally put his race card back in the deck, he figured being as lewd as possible was his next best approach to getting out.  Or getting it in.  I couldn't tell.  He was absolutely tiny.  5'4\", maybe 110 pounds.  I was about 210 pounds and about 6'2\" in boots.  \n\nHe started off by making trashy passes at me, complimenting my build and eyes.  Then he started asking me if I had ever fucked a black guy before and assured me he could give the best head I would ever experience.  During his blabber, I am trying to get basic information from him for my report.  I am largely ignoring his comments and trying to minimize my time around him as I see it developing into a possible sexual harassment issue.  \n\nI have a really good poker face, but this kid was saying some really funny, perverted things.  I decide that I need a break to get some smiles out, so I go into the back and talk to someone for a second while the dispatcher and another guard watch him.  When I return, he excitedly says something to the effect of, \"Oh, there he is!  Are you finally ready?\"  \n\nWhile sitting in the chair, he manages to spread his legs and lift them up behind his head, \"You like this tight little black ass?  You want to stuff your hard cock in me?\"  Ok, enough is enough.  I tell him he needs to cool it off or some kind of harassment charge will be pressed in addition to whatever else he was getting.  Pouty and reluctantly he returns to a normal position and proceeds to bad mouth me, retracting his previous compliments.  He stops when his phone rings.\n\nIn California, we only can search an arrest for weapons.  We cannot confiscate any other items from their person.  Most people's arms are rendered pretty useless when they are in handcuffs.  So when his phone went off in his front pocket, we didn't think much about it.  That is until we hear, \"Hello?\"\n\nHe was so lanky, he was able to reach around his back with both arms, extract the device from his pocket, and hold it to his ear to talk.  I told him he could not do that, and ask him to put it away.  He complied and placed it on the desk next to his chair.  But whoever he was talking to called back.  So, I asked him to silence it.  He couldn't figure it out.  The phone kept ringing and ringing and ringing.  He picked it up again and answered it, so I fetched the boss to handle the situation.\n\nHe comes in and is a lot more aggressive than I was.  He demands that the phone be shut off.  The kid hands it to him so he can deal with it, the whole time it is ringing, but he can't find the button either.  It was one of those Sidekick things which none of us were particularly familiar with.  The kid then started to get snappy with my boss and called him an idiot.  Boss threw the phone back at him and told him to turn it off.  Instead, he answers again.\n\nBoss man snatches the phone by its lanyard, yells goodbye, and hangs up.  After a few more seconds of trying to find the power button, it rings again.  Boss just takes the thing by the lanyard and whips it down onto the table repeatedly.  The phone explodes into its main components and then some.  The kid stares in shock and disbelief.  I couldn't tell if he was going to scream or cry, but I was having the most difficult time staving laughter.\n\nThe kid finally, and meekly, mumbles that my boss would be paying for that.  Which he did.  On the company card.  The entire second half of that arrest made my day and a few days after that.",

        "text": "This happened several years ago as I haven't worked security for some time, but it's still a prime example of how clients will hire security officers and then try to tell them how to do their jobs.\n\n--------\n\nI was working security at an apartment complex several years ago, covering a shift that lasted from 6:00pm until around 2:00am, at which point a part-timer would replace me from 2:00am until 6:00am, giving the complex security for 12 hours per day.\n\nAnyway, on my first day at this location, the site supervisor explained to me that the client was very, very specific about what route he wanted guards to follow and when he wanted patrols. He had us follow the exact same route, and had us run it every hour on the hour while on duty. The client even had the guards use [Deggy wands](http://www.deggy.com/) to verify we followed the route correctly and at the proper times.\n\nNow, does anyone see a problem with having a guard follow the same exact route at the same exact times every night?\n\nDuring my first three months at this job, we had four cars and two apartments broken into, one motorcycle stolen, and two bicycles stolen, all of which happened either on my shift or on the part-timer's morning shift.\n\nEventually, the client called a meeting between myself, one other guard (the weekend guy), and the site supervisor. That was when both me and the supervisor pointed out that the route and timing of the patrols was too predictable and that anyone with a brain could figure out where the guard would be at any given time. The client was reluctant and refused to change the process, but wouldn't even explain why he was so insistent on the rigid, predictable schedule.\n\nAbout two weeks later, I took over as site supervisor for that site. I ignored the client's request and had the guards start staggering the patrols, an action that surely could have gotten me fired for breaching the contract. However, within one week of implementing the change, I scared off two teenagers that were trying to cut a lock off of a gate into someone's back yard, and a week or so after that, one of my other guards caught a thief that had jacked up a car and was trying to steal the rims off of it.\n\nWe reported this to the client, including the fact that I had staggered the patrols. At first, he acted very distraught that I'd gone against what he'd asked for, but after I pointed out that changing the times and routes had allowed us to stop at least two separate incidents in less than a month, he capitulated and agreed to let me schedule the patrols as long as \"he didn't have to see the schedule.\"\n\nI later found out that the reason he wanted everything to be so painfully rigid was because he was severely OCD and couldn't stand reading patrol schedules unless everything lined up perfectly. According to one of the apartment managers there, he even fired one of the cleaning crew companies because their uniforms weren't symmetrical.",

Technically, only salaried or clocked-in employees could do this, but it was a common after bars activity that was overlooked by management. \n\nTweedledee is 19 years old, 6 foot, 350+ pounds, and married to an illegal immigrant who is 15 years older than himself.  He is arrogant, lacks any said sort of common sense, and is asthmatic.  He has no business in this industry, especially not at a high-profile property like ours.\n\nTweedledum is 24, but has the emotional capacity and intelligence of someone a decade younger.  He is the one that was repeatedly bashing the woman-beater's head into the ground from earlier.  He used to watch my girlfriend and I smoke outside on the CCTV because he had a crush on her in high school.  And the tiniest amount of criticism usually brought him to tears. \n\nOn this particular night, I had gotten off at about 22:00 from being the swing corporal.  I had exciting plans to pick up a movie and make my girlfriend Cornish game hens and drink wine.  I couldn't be so lucky.\n\nAt about 23:30, I get a frantic phone call from Tweedledee.  \n\n\"Uh, Drew?!\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"The [T3s](http://saintjohnshawn.com/wp-images/t3_vehicle.jpg) are missing and the office is trashed!\"\n\n\"So why are you calling me?  You have three sergeants, a lieutenant, and two directors that you should be calling before me.\"\n\n\"I tried!  They aren't answering!  Please help!\"\n\n\"Try them again and if you still can't get them, call me back.\"\n\nI wasn't too excited about fielding that call.  It was above my pay grade and not my problem.  In retrospect, though, taking that call and handling the situation was probably a deciding factor in my next promotion.\n\nMy phone rings a couple minutes later, this time it is Tweedledum.\n\n\"Drew?  No answer from anybody.\"\n\n\"I tried them too, I know.  Do you need me to come down there?\"\n\n\"Uh...-\"\n\n\"Yes or no, Tweedledum?  Do I need to drive across town, in the middle of the night, interrupting my date night to handle this?  Or is it something you guys can figure out?\"\n\n\"Um... Yes, you need to come here.\"\n\nFuck me.\n\nSo, the girlfriend, who isn't very happy, and I load up and head to the mall.  I have my radio, OC, and cuffs on me, walk into the office and yell at them to go look for the missing equipment while I go check doors and trying calling someone again.\n\nThe first of the T3s was found less than 150 feet from the office in plain sight near a lingerie story.  I see it on my way to do doors and blast them over the radio.  Tweedledee starts to stammer something about my language and the FCC to which I respond, \"FUCK THE FCC!\"\n\nI get down to a secluded back hallway where I could call the lieutenant again.  After the third attempt, he answers obviously drunk.  He explains that he and one of the sergeants had done an exterior door check after walking back from the bars and discovered at least three doors unsecured.  They then walked up to the office to find it unsecured as well. \n\nI found the second T3 in a hallway and instructed Tweedledum to go get it and told Tweedledee to finish locking the doors.  I returned to the office to have a smoke, relax, and talk to the girlfriend.  \n\nTweedledum and Tweedledee got back into the office a few minutes later where I laid into them for a solid 10 minutes about the value of what is kept in the office and how it affects both our company, the client, and the client's tenants.  Nothing that attack them, but it wasn't extremely nice.  Both of them were in tears at the end.  \n\nAs I headed out the door, I told them to make sure everything remained secure through the night.  They asked what had happened and I said, \"Grave checks are real; don't get caught with your pants down.\"\n\nBefore I pulled away, I had one more radio transmission that essentially threatened their jobs if I ever had to come down there for some \"petty bullshit\" again.\n\nThe next morning I was woken by my phone ringing off the hook.  Seven missed calls from my boss.  I call him back.\n\n\"Drew!  WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED LAST NIGHT!\"\n\n\"The fuck you mean?  The tard-twins called me up because they had a problem that they couldn't handle and I WAS THE ONLY PERSON TO ANSWER MY PHONE!\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I'll call you back.\"\n\nI needed to get a hold of the LT and Sgt. who did this to make sure that I wasn't going to throw them under the bus.  They said that they haven't heard shit, but they didn't care if I told boss man.  I call him back again.\n\n\"LT and Sgt. did a grave inspection last night.  Tweedledee and Tweedledum had left the entire building and office unsecured.  They decided to move the T3s around to teach them a lesson.\"\n\n\"Did you explain this to them?\"\n\n\"Yes, I bitched at them for a while.\"\n\n\"Well they told the morning supervisor that vandals had broken in, and the supervisor called PD to have a CSI team come down and print the place.\"\n\n\"They are idiots, then.  I told them what happened without dropping names, and if the sup had any issue he should have called me.\"\n\n\"Yeah, well...  I'll see you this afternoon.\"\n\nSo, the moral of the story is that when speaking to idiots, you need to be explicit or they will not get it.  Spell it out.  Use a whiteboard.  PowerPoint.  Just be clear.\n\nStupidity in this industry gets things stolen, companies sued, and people hurt.",

He starts talking, and he has the rhythm and diction that remind me of Dennis Hopper's character in Apocalypse Now.\n\nI talk to him a little more and come to believe he's deep into whatever trip he wanted to go on.  He rants a bit, but non-threatening.  But, I always remember Hunter Thompson's quote: You can turn your back on a man, but never turn your back on a drug.\n\nSo, he asks me if I can help him find paradise.  I tell him, no, but I know some people who can.\n\nSo, again, I radio dispatch and tell them my subject is looking for paradise.  He'd like us to help him get there.  I ask my dispatcher if he knows anyone who can help him get to paradise.\n\nDispatch says \"10-4.  I'll give them a call.\"\n\nA few minutes later the police show up.  I tell the subject they can help him get to paradise.  He's really grateful.  He thanks us all repeatedly, even when being handcuffed and put into the squad car.\n\nI hope he found what he was looking for.\n\n",

She was always studying.\n\nAnd, it wasn't that they were covering it up.  I'd find her and they'd have a dozen books strewn all over the car.  Pre-laptop computer age, they'd have their notebooks out with notes all over them and post it notes on all the texts trying to work out some paper or something.\n\nI remember one time I found her behind the tennis courts.\n\n\"Hey, Mary.  Everything ok tonight?\"\n\n\"Yeah, my roommate is being a bitch so we came out here to have some privacy to study.  We're about to have a snack.

        "text": "As many of you who have worked security know, you will sooner or later see some weird shit.  Some of the shit is gross, some is just bizarre, but a lot of the time there is shit that would send a less desensitized person into a blind rage.  Only once did I approach that threshold. \n\nIt was a relatively slow day and I was standing in line at Starbucks with a friend from management.  I was the swing supervisor for security and was pretty much free to do as I wanted.  Before I could place my order, though, my dispatcher sent some strange radio traffic.\n\n\"Drew, can you come back up here for customer service.\"\n\nNormal words, but the inflection in her voice said there was more to the story.  I figured one of our guards did something mildly annoying like telling someone they can't skateboard inside the mall and now the punk kid is yelling at the dispatcher when she told them that wasn't a valid complaint.  It happened almost daily.\n\n\"Afirm, heading back now.\"\n\nI make my way to the escalators that are about 100 feet from Starbucks.  From the top of the escalators it is probably another 100 feet to the office.  I am walking at a typical hurried pace.  Enough to get me there quicker, but not enough to incite panic.  About 10 feet from the escalator my radio goes off again.  It is the dispatcher, now much more intense.\n\n\"Drew, I need you here now.\"\n\nI jog the rest of the way to the escalator which, for whatever reason, was absolutely slammed.  I am quickly but politely pushing my way past people who just give me dirty looks like there is nothing this mall cop could be doing that is so important he had to jostle their boba tea.  Then at the half way point, the radio goes off again, this time just the primal scream and unintelligible yelling of a woman.\n\nI take the rest of the escalator two steps at a time and sprint to the office.  Surprisingly, I am the first person there.  Although she asked for me, the closest guard should have heard her tone by the second transmission and headed over.  Standing in the doorway, I see two HFAs cowering behind the dispatcher to my right, and an HMA to my left just standing there.  The women are crying, the man seems perfectly calm, and my dispatcher is just giving me a \"where the fuck were you\" glare.  \n\n\"What the fuck is going on in here?\"\n\nI try not to swear in front of customers, but this was obviously different.  At this time the guard that should have beat me to the office runs up behind me.\n\nThe first woman speaks first, \"He HIT me!\"\n\nI look to the dispatcher, \"Yeah?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" she responds with not so subtle annoyance.\n\nI tell the guard to place the man in handcuffs.  The man complies and doesn't say a word.  No issue whatsoever.  By now, the corporal on and another guard come running up.  I have the corporal take the girls into my office so we can separate the parties.  This was suboptimal, as having a man in handcuffs in the lobby is bad PR.  We also had a detention bench back there we could lock him to to prevent what ended up happening from happening.  It was a quick solution in a fast moving volatile situation.  \n\nWe had the man sit in one of our lobby chairs and faced him toward the wall.  Next to him was an end table with a plastic pamphlet holder filled with bullshit information of security and the mall.  While one of the guards was taking the women's statements, I was talking with the corporal and dispatcher about calling the police, the boss, and whoever else needed calling.  \n\nSuddenly we hear a small explosion on the other side of the room.  We turn to see that the man had stood up kicked the end table across the room shattering our bullshit pamphlet holder and was now squaring up against the corporal and myself.  All while still cuffed.  I am not a small guy, the corporal was not a small guy, our newly decided combatant was.  We stopped, stunned at his unwarranted brazenness, then said fuck him.  \n\nI went for the leg sweep, the corporal went for the clothesline.  The guy was on the ground almost as quickly as he stood up.  Upon hearing the fighting, the first guard came into the room and helped us restrain the guy.  The second guard, who was highly emotional and kinda dumb, also came in to assist.  At that point, though, the man was completely under our control aside from a little wiggling.  Guard Two, however insisted on repeatedly slamming his head into the joint of the floor and wall. \n\nVerbally reprimanding an employee in front of an arrest is a terrible idea.  It allows the arrest to notice that perhaps a guard acted in a way that could be used as leverage in their case.  This would not have gotten this man off, but it would have hurt the company in bad PR and lawsuit.  All I could do is rip the guard off the man and push him out the front door telling him to make sure we don't have a crowd.\n\nIt became very apparent that we needed to switch rooms with the women.  My office had two doors: one was directly behind the dispatcher which the women had used, and the other was in the back down a hallway accessible from the opposite side of the lobby where we had our friend sprawled on the floor.  Our only option was to lead him into the hallway and wait for the girls to vacate before moving him to the detention bench in the office.\n\nWhile the man, the first guard, and I waited for the girls to leave, I gave the first guard this grin like \"what a day\".  I looked back at the man who, in turn, spit the biggest fucking lugie onto my face.  In my eye, down my cheek, the side of my mouth.  Saliva and mucous everywhere.  The guard looked at me terrified.  The corporal had also came around and witnessed this.  He had an expression of uncertainty and worry.\n\nI didn't say a thing.  \n\nI calmly wiped the mess from my face, and then bitch slapped the living shit out of the guy.\n\nJust one strike.  The corporal let out a nervous cringe chuckle, then opened the office door.  The man tried spitting again, but just got it on himself.  I slammed his ass down on the detention bench and his head bounced off the wall with a satisfying thud.  I went to the bathroom to clean up properly.\n\nI was pretty conflicted about what had just happened there.  If it had been any of the other supervisors, they probably would have hurt the guy and said it happened in the fight.  I figured the slap was far more demoralizing.  But I had just yelled at guard two for excessive force less than five minutes prior.  Was it different because the man attacked me?  Am I a hypocrite?  I am not supposed to let emotions dictate my actions like that.  I am not supposed to lose my cool.\n\nThe cops eventually got there and \"woke\" the man up from his pretend sleep/meditation session that he started after being moved to the office.  The police officer asked him if hitting a girl made him a big man.  The guy responded in a rather creepy way.\n\n\"I told the bitch she had it coming.  She keeps fucking with my head, man, she had it coming, she had it coming, she had it coming...\"\n\nIt turned out that she had just moved to the Bay Area from Los Angeles partially to get away from him who had been stalking her.  He followed her up here and to the mall.  She came to the office when she realized he was there and that is when things came to a head.  He was charged with two accounts of battery, one on her and one on me, vandalism for the bullshit flyer thing, and I think something else.  I forget.\n\nGuard one who witnessed the slap was kinda a goody two shoes who lacked any real world common sense.  He did his job well so he stuck around, but socially, he just didn't get it sometimes.  He ended up going to another supervisor the next day asking questions like if we are responsible for the wellbeing of our arrests and if it is moral to hit someone in handcuffs.  The supervisor essentially told him to fuck off, but gave me the heads up.  I got a little grief about it from my boss, but only because guard one witnessed it.  This helped with my guilt a little, but I still think about it every once in a while.\n\n**tl;dr What did the five fingers say to the face?**",

        "text": "Hey everyone. So as one user pointed out to me, I promised to tell some stories from my time at the psych hospital.  So here I am to share a few stories that are, if you'll excuse the pun, crazy.\n\nSo I'll start with two quick stories.  Both about some destruction caused by patients.  I'll also, give you some background.\n\nSo I live in a very affluent area.  The hospital was a small complex, owned by a larger hospital. It was a single building on 2-3 acres.  There were 3 Units. 2 for adults, 1 for children.  Normally, 1 unit would be for psych patients, the other unit would be for Detox.  However, do to patients having issues with other patients, or bringing in to many patients, or general ineptitude, we often mixed a lot of these (Adult) patients up.  A lot of the people we got in were very well off.  Some from big families that just threw money at the hospital so their \"loved one\" could get meds and then be sent home when they weren't flipping out.\n\nAnyways, I was on patrol one day, when I heard \"Code Green Unit 2\" over the loud speaker.  Code Green basically meant \"Everyone get your ass here now!\"  The other units would have a minimal staff left while everyone from nurses, doctors, down to janitors went to wherever the code was paged.  So needless to say I wasn't going to enjoy this.  \n\nI ran over, swiped into the unit, and saw one patient smiling ear to ear, being led away to his room by a nurse.  I turned the corner to see one of the giant 3x5 windows had been smashed out.  These windows were supposed to be shatter resistant, and damn near impossible to break. Well apparently this dude just picked up a chair, carried it down the hallway, and threw it through the window... and then just stood there.  I stood guard while the maintanence went to get plywood to board up the window.  Not 2 minutes later, another patient comes bounding down the hallway full sprint, pushes past me, and tries jumping out the window.  Gets extremely cut up and hurt as we are trying to pull him inside.  \n\nSo we get him inside, call an ambulance and send him to the main hospital. We get the window boarded up, and I went to go interview the patient who originally threw the chair through the window.  He was a good patient who never caused any issues.  So I asked him why he broke the window, and he said he wanted to feel the breeze and get some fresh air.  We asked him why he didn't wait 10 minutes for the daily walk outside, and he just smiled and said \"Well, who should have to wait for that kind of thing?\"\n\n\nNow for the main story.  **Did you...did you eat it?\"\n\nSo apparently several months before I was hired, a patient was brought into hospital who caused MASSIVE amount of damage to the property.  The hospital was affiliated with a branch of the catholic church, so did a lot of charity cases.  This guy was one of those cases.  He would never lay a hand on another person, but he would just destroy any object he could.  His acts of \"agression\" would range from something as simple as crumbling up his water cup with an angry scowl, to ripping up books, movies, and board games in the common room.\n\nApparently when he came in, he immediatly started ripping the card readers out of the wall.  Then whent hey put him in his room, he jumped up, pulling down the fire system pipes, and setting off the water in the entire unit.  He caused over $80,000 worth of damage in a single afternoon, and shut down the unit for several weeks.\n\nSo naturally, he was allowed to come back to the hospital. Because logic.  I was informed our newest patient was the infamous Mr. BreakYourShit.  Not 5 minutes later I receive a code call from his unit. Sure enough, he's in his room, raging and yelling.  Apparently he tried to rip the card readers again, but was unable to as they were now recessed in the walls. Then he went into the common room, and fucked with the tv box.  Our boxes had those white plastic cards necessary to make the box work. Never understood the point of those things, but whatever. So he went in, and removed the cards from both tv boxes. Another patient ratted him out, and he ran into his room.  We got him to settle down, and we start asking him where the card was.  We searched the room, and we couldn't find it, there was still piss and shit in the toilet so we know he didn't flush it. \n\n\"You guys are the crazy ones, blaming me for everything I don't do anything!\"  the guys says.  As he was saying the last word, a small piece of white plastic comes shooting out of his mouth and falls to floor.\n\n\"Did you...did you eat it?\"\n\n\"Yes\"\n\n\"Oooook then.\"\n\nUnfortunantly those cards costed like $200 a piece, so we had to wait several days to get approval to pay for new ones.  So all the patients were antsy and bored.  The next day the guy picked up the tv, and dropped it, then tried blaming the president for it.  \n\nHe was finally released and told not to return.  \n",

As she runs in to the bathroom a piece of deuce just drops on to the floor right outside of the bathroom. Nobody witnessed this except for myself and a co-worker watching this go down. A bunch of patrons walk around and look at the mess in disgust. The custodian shows up several minutes later and the poopertrator walks out of the bathroom looking at the mess that the poor guy has to clean up. She makes a facial expression of \"what kind of nasty human being would do that!?\" and walks away.",

        "text": "In the mid '70s I worked for Campus Security as contract labor.  It was, at the time, a small office with only six full time staffers.  Which left nobody to cover sick days, vacations, transfers, etc.  So we (law enforcement degree majors) would be hired to help as needed. \n\nFrankly, it wasn't a bad gig.  Extra spending cash, no supervision, and enough guaranteed weirdness to satisfy the most jaded redittor!  This is about SuperJock, who got just what he deserved.\n\nThe 3 story dorm he resided in was built in the early '60s, which meant it had some outdated features.  One of the most glaring was limited access.  You could either enter through the front or the back, but only the front had an elevator and foyer.  The rear was steps only.  \n\nOur SuperJock thought he was the baddest guy on campus, and absolutely loved his perceived power.  He'd selected his table in the cafeteria, and god forbid that anyone else would sit there, ever.  He'd slide into \"his\" seat and knock any miscreant he found down onto the floor, to be followed by the interlopers food.  People walking through hallways scurried to move out of his way, lest they get trod upon.  I could go on, but this bully was the apple of Coach's eye, and could do no wrong.  An totally arrogant asshole, but could he play ball.  The Administration loved him.\n\nWell, early one morning I get a call to come to SuperJock's dorm.  I take the elevator up to the third floor and am greeted by a most amazing site.  There, in the foyer, is SuperJock's VW Beetle.  It is completely assembled with a key in the ignition.  It starts and runs.  And there is absolutely no way it should be there short of a transporter beam.  There are no windows big enough, the stairs are narrow with multiple landings, and the elevator hold 10 people, tops.\nI told SuperJock, who was foaming at the mouth over this indignation, that I'd look into it at my earliest convenience.\n \nBy the time I got back to the office most everybody was there, and wanted to hear the whole story.  I told them what I'd observed, showed them a few Polaroids I'd snapped of the \"crime\", and left to see what I could turn up. I heard laughter all the way down the sidewalk.\n\nIt didn't take long, actually.  I walked over to the auto shop, and asked some of the guys who I should talk to about this.  They already knew what was up, and pointed out four individuals.  The conversation went something like this......\"You know why I'm here.  You know that I know that you did it.  The only question I have is HOW did you do it?\"\n\nI didn't know that they were guilty.  I had absolutely no evidence, but they didn't know that.  But they were very proud of the outcome and started trying to out-talk each other with the details of the \"crime.\"  And at this point it's hard to call it a crime.  The victims car wasn't stolen, it wasn't damaged, and had not been used for anything illegal.  It was stored in a safe place, out of the weather.  And he could start it up and drive it......drive it 20 feet or so.  I didn't see the downside.\n\nIt seems that the previous week SuperJock had walked into a campus party, looked over the available ladies, and decided that he wanted one girl in particular.  The problem was that she had arrived with one of the aforementioned auto mechanics.  Didn't stop SuperJock, no sireee!  He fancied himself quite the man about town, and was able to get her to leave with him. I don't know the whole story, but the next day he hunted the mechanic down and complimented him on his taste in dates.  Seems that he'd bedded her and wanted to taunt our tech with all the details.  This meant war!\n\nThey'd hit his dorm at about one A.M.  They'd brought all the tools necessary, and the four of them had disassembled, carried the pieces up the elevator, and reassembled it, all before 5:00 a.m.  They told me the hardest thing was the floorpan (chassis) which they'd had to haul up the stairs.  Quite a feat, in my humble opinion.\n\nOK.  Got the story, now what to do with it.  Should I go to my Sargent with the tale?  Naw.  How about the administration?  Double naw.  How about the local newspaper?  Nothing like a little shame for the star quarterback, eh?   Yes!\n\nSo I contacted a friend who worked there, and lo and behold, look what appeared?  It was glorious. He as the laughing stock of the campus for the rest of the semester.  Transferred out to a four year college after that.  Never saw the asshole again.\n\nAs for the auto guys, they came in on Saturday, reversed the process, and had the car back on the ground before the day was out.\nIf they got in trouble I never heard about it.\n\nAll in all, just another week in Campus Security.",

        "text": "Hello, security folks. \n\nMany of you may know me or someone like me from your work. I'm the alarm guy. \n\nDepending on the quality of your own alarm guy, you'll either love me or hate me.\n\nI was working at a large industrial park and was on call 24/7 along with the other techs.\n\nMy ex had already dropped off my son for a holiday weekend when I received the call at home from security dispatch. A warehouse had an intermittent security alarm going off in it and they had a guard posted on the building.\n\nI asked them if they had tried calling any of the other techs. They had and no one was picking up. I needed to fix this or they would have to have an extra guard stationed until it was.\n\nDamn, damn, damn. Everyone I could ask to babysit was out of town for the holiday.\n\nMy aunt, she would work and she lived less than an hour away. I gave dispatch my ETA and took off.\n\nI dropped my young'un off on my aunt and headed out to the facility.  Because my POV was not allowed in the industrial area, I had to grab the utilities vehicle I was assigned.\n\nI drive out to the site and find the guard watching over the area from outside its fenced enclosure. I ask him to let me in but he can't. He doesn't have the keys.\n\nI get on his radio and contact dispatch, they tell me that the guy with that key ring is doing rounds and will be finished soon.\n\nI wait and BS with the guard for a while until the other guard shows up with the keys about a half hour later.\n\nWe finagle the gate open and I enter the area around the warehouse and look at the set of double doors that were giving the alarms. \n\nI asked for the keys to the warehouse. The guard gives m a dumbfounded look. \"Don't you have them?\"\n\nI try not to face palm but fail. \"I'm not allowed to have the keys. I'm the alarm guy. I can get around these security systems.\"\n\n\"But they trust you to work on the alarms.\"\n\n\"And if something comes up missing and I have access to the keys? I don't want them either.\"\n\nThe warehouse is still sending in intermittent alarms and now I find out I don't have access to fix the problem. \n\n\"If I can't get in, I can't work on it.\"\n\n\"Damn, we're having a hard enough time just finding people to take the assigned shifts because of the holiday.\"  \n\nI look at  the doors with the resignation of seeing a nastygram on my desk come Tuesday and notice something. The metal doors are swinging away from the building, only being held closed by the lock. This is just enough to make the proximity switches mounted on the door fail to make and instead send in an alarm when the wind hit them.  \n\nSomeone forgot to pin the one of the double doors closed when they were securing the warehouse.\n\nI try to push the doors all the way closed and fail to do so. I make a running charge at the door and manage to push it all the way closed and the alarm sets up a moment later.\n\nThis is not my problem but I work with the security guys on a regular basis. Maybe I can fix this.\n\nI release the doors and a few seconds later dispatch reports it is in alarm again.\n\nI walk around until I find the biggest rocks around and start piling them against the door until I have a good sized pile of them and the alarm finally sets up.\n\nWe secure the area and I cut out. I grab my POV and head out to pick up my kid. \n\nHe's hungry, I'm hungry, and my aunt is hungry. I take them out for Mexican.\n\nWith time and a half, I figured that I made about 180$ for piling up four rocks against a door.  Bonus: Mexican food.",

I normally did perimeter patrol, but this night I had to stick a little closer to the main campus and be seen in the lounge of the women's dorm.\n\nBut, I still had to periodically make other rounds, and on returning to the dorm, I found a girl and her boyfriend had looked up a VCR (that long ago) to the dorm TV.  The lights were out, 2 AM, and they're well into watching Pink Floyd's \"The Wall.\"\n\nNow, I have indulged in recreational drugs from time to time, and I've watched this movie under the influence.

        "text": "I worked at two different malls in the same town for one contractor.  The properties shared two administrators and usually had their own supervisor manager (lieutenant).  Under the LT was usually two property specific supervisors (sergeant) and then there was a floater who knew both properties and could cover days off.  That was me.\n\nThe two properties were as different as night and day.  One was in the middle of downtown and patronized by all kinds of stupid kids, gang bangers, housewives, and the homeless.  There was never a slow day there.  The other location was in the middle of a remodel, so many of the shops had closed.  The majority of the people who came there were senior citizens and the seriously deranged vagrants.  It was usually boring, but when it got bad, it was strange.\n\nI had just spent the better part of a month working the slow property for some reason or another.  It was great because I could come in late, stay plain clothes until well after lunch while working on paperwork (YouTube) and conducting exterior checks (smoking).  I got pretty comfortable in my position and then they sent me downtown for a while.  \n\nBegrudgingly I showed up for the swing shift still a little hungover and not happy I had to drive farther than I was used to.  I came in to see my least favorite dispatcher was working, I had a new guy to train, and someone had called out when we were already understaffed.  Thankfully, the corporal (keyholder) who was on was my favorite.  Intelligent and competent.  Regardless, three guards, a dispatcher, and myself was not enough people to watch the 5-10,000 people we would get that afternoon.  Especially when I was going to lose the dispatcher two hours before we close because of stupid scheduling.\n\nI sent two guys inside and I took the noob out side in the truck to go over some basic exterior shit.  He was a nice kid, definitely book smart, but he like to whine and was pretty lazy.  I was concerned that he wasn't picking up everything I was putting down.  Not because he couldn't, but he wasn't paying attention.  \n\nAfter being with him the majority of the night, and with the night being uncharacteristically slow, I decide that I will hole up in the office for a bit answering the phones after the dispatcher leaves.  Everything was going swimmingly right up until closing.  I get a phone call from an employee at a store who said that when he was taking out the nightly trash to one of the hydraulic compactors (think garbage truck sans truck) a voice from *inside* the compactor requested that he cycle the system.  I.E. compact it.  \n\nWe have had our fair share of suicide attempts at this place, so although rare, it happens.  It is also one of the few things that require an **immediate** corporate notification.  The other ones being murder, rape, car theft, and a press presence.  I started jogging toward the compactor while calling for my corporal to assist me and delegating door locking to the noob and the other guard.  On my way down to the compactor, I see noob running by saying that some lady had just been purse jacked.  Strong-arm felony robbery.  Fuck me.\n\nSo, now, noob and the other guard are chasing some guy through the parking lot and the two supervisors are going to make sure we don't have human spam in the food court compactor.  I would have sent the corporal to the other call, but the suicide easily was more important than a non-injury robbery.  Fortunately, PD was monitoring our channel since it was a slow night for them and they come over saying they will be assisting with that.  \n\nWe get to the compactor and immediately cut the power to it.  We call into it to see if we could get a response, but because the employee waited to report it, there would have been about 10 minutes of garbage on top of them.  We decide to call the fire department and get them to help.  The fire department arrives and says that we need to pull some garbage out so they can use their FLIR to look for a body.  Maintenance refuses to do this as \"it isn't in their job description\", fire won't do it for the same reasons, so in I go.  Balls deep in everything from Panda Express to bathroom garbage.  \n\nIn the mean time, I hear mic clicks over the radio, a sure sign of a fight.  I tell my corporal to handle whatever the hell is going on in the parking lot while I deal with fire.  After about a half an hour of removing garbage, getting the compactor scanned by fire, reloading garbage, finding no body, I haven't heard a single thing about the parking lot robber.  I finally make it back up to the office to change and throw my clothes away.  Soon, the *lieutenant and assistant director* come over the radio bragging about how they \"came to the rescue\" and wanted to know \"what the hell I had been doing\".  \n\nBefore they got to the office, my corporal walks in.\n\n\"What happened?\"\n\n\"The guy ended up getting stopped by PD.\"\n\n\"Ok...\"\n\n\"But then he slipped out of his handcuffs.\"\n\n\"Fuck.\"\n\n\"He started flailing the one wrist with the cuff using the empty cuff as brass knuckles.  When I got there, I just saw one officer wailing on him with a Maglite, the other dry tasing him, LT and AD trying to hold him down, and noob and the other guard watching.\"\n\n\"What the hell?\"\n\n\"Finally they got him recuffed and placed in the car.\"\n\n\"Ok, good.\"\n\nRight as he finishes, a girl walks into the office.\n\n\"Can I help you?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I think one of your guys went chasing after a guy who took some stuff from me.\"\n\n\"Yeah, was it your purse?\"\n\nLaughing, \"No, I work at [name of yuppy clothing store where they don't have uniforms or name tags] and he came in and ran out with some $300 jeans.\"\n\nShoplifting.  Misdemeanor.  Not even something we are supposed to get involved with.\n\nDumbfounded I stare at her.  My corporal turns away trying to suppress laughter.  I have her clarify what she meant, and it was true, PD and my bosses beat and tased a guy over something that was not our problem.  And because I was the supervisor, I was standing at the bottom of the hill all this shit rolls down.  \n\nI have her fill out a short narrative and she leaves right as noob, guard, LD, and AD walk in the door.  I cut off AD from his gloating and ask noob what exactly the girl said to him.\n\n\"She saw me and pointed at the guy and yelled, 'he took my stuff'.\"\n\n\"Just like that?\"\n\n\"Yeah, why?\"\n\n\"Did she work at any store?\"\n\n\"Not that I know of.\"\n\nThank God.  In California a private citizen can make an arrest under two circumstances:  a misdemeanor is committed in their presence, or they have reason to believe a felony has been committed.  If she had told him she was an employee of Yuppy &amp; Bitch, and he (against policy) decided to help, she would have to be the one to \"arrest\" him.  The guard could effect the arrest with handcuffs, but she would be considered the arresting party and would have to be there when it happens.  If not, it would be illegal detention or kidnapping.  Because he thought a felony had been committed, he was in the clear.\n\nI showed him the narrative and explained all of that to him.  He kinda just gave me an \"oh fuck\" look and I told him to finish locking the place up with the other guard.  He leaves, and LT and AD are still there jerking each other off.  They ask what I was doing during all of this and why I smelled so bad.  I blow up asking why, if they had been on property the entire time, they didn't come help at the mention of potential suicide.  They said they had their radios off.  Probably playing online poker.  They turned them on when they were about to leave their office (different part of the building) and caught the part about PD being on property.  I explain where I was, what I was doing, and then bitched at them about the schedule. \n\nKnowing they were there when this all happened, on the clock with their radios off, I could relax about losing my job since they were above me and thus responsible.  \n\nI really don't miss the liability of contracted security.  \n\nI couldn't get the smell out of me for two days. \n\n",

        "text": "So let me start off by fluffling myself up a bit.  I am smart.  Not like Rain Man smart, but pretty damn intelligent.  I tend to absorb information pretty easily, and tested with a high IQ even back in HS.  My friends love me at Pub Trivia nights.\n\nAnyways, the downside to all of this, is I used to REALLY hate feeling stupid for not knowing anything.  This would often lead me to clam up and not ask questions, for fear of appearing unintelligent.  As you can imagine, this was NOT a good trait to have in security work. \n\nAnd this is a short simple tale about how I learned to never assume, and question everything.\n\nSo, back about 6 years ago, I worked for a large amusement park company. Not supposed to hint at which chain of parks it belongs too, but certain details about the parks must be spoken of for the story to make sense. You can all use your keen detective skills to figure it out.\n\nWell like any theme park, we had people walking around in costumes, playing characters.  Some were famous cartoon characters, while some others were superheroes and super villains.  We had a section of the park that was all super hero based, and the performers would often walk around as as a group staging mock battles and scaring children if they were villains. Although one time I did see on performer chase a group of pre teens around after they informed said perfomrer that his aquatic based super hero was, and I quote, \"A scaly legged fag who nobody likes\".  \n\nAnyways, throught my first sumer I would often see this one perfomer walking around other sections of the park.  The superhero performers never left the superhero area except for the shows performed each morning as the park opened.  This performer was always in the same costume, playing the same super villain.  Now, I wasn't a comic book guy, but knew this character was essentially a clone of a really popular super hero. And this villain was the opposite of the hero in everyway.  This perfomer had a jagged face like  the villain, greasy black hair always slicked back, and a black costume with a big read \"S\" on the chest. I would see him dancing with kids, interacting with guest randomly, taking pictures with them, etc.  Nothing out of the ordinary, though sometimes he creeped people out.  But I thought it was all in character.  That's also why I ASSUMED he was never in the super hero area of the park.  Since they were SUPPOSED to stay only in that area, and he always did the opposite of what the hero was doing, he stayed out of that area. Just really committing to the character.  Or so I thought.\n\nAnyways, one day, I am doing my patrols, and see him eating at a table in the guest area.  I walked over and said \"hey man, better go eat in the back stage area with everyone else before you get in trouble.\"\n\nHe looked up at me, and shook his head.  \n\nMe: Cmon man. You know the rules.  \n\nHe went back to eating his burger, and seemed to whimper.\n\nMe: Hey man there are kids here. Can't let them see you breaking character, right?\n\nHe just kept shaking his head, muttering \"Go away go away go away!\" over and over.  I look around, and saw another guard and waved him over.  I explained the situation, and the guard pulled me away.  After we got back stage, he explained the situation to me.\n\nApparently this guy wasn't a performer. He wasn't even employed by the park.  He lived down the street.  He and his brother were both mentally handicapped.  They would get season passes and come to the park every day during the season that the weather wasn't bad, and just hang around.  And apparently he wore a costume EVERY DAY.  Last year, he was Pocohantus.  Full on dress and everything.  Apparently the year before they had an issue where he was going commando under the dress and sometimes when he jumped up and down in excitement, the dress would fly up.... yea.  This year he had chosen to get a black costume of the famous super hero. The greasy hair was just bad hygeine and the face was just bad genetics.\n\nSo that's when I learned that I am an asshole. And to always ask questions. Even dumb ones.  And to be thankful this guy didn't like Wonder Woman.\n\n**TL:DR - Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?**",

        "text": "I have a problem with people who call people who hate homosexuals homophobes.  A phobia is a fear of something, not a hatred of it.\n\nAnd, that brings me to Chuck.  Poor Chuck was a genuine homophobe.  He didn't hate them.  He had an intense fear of them.  If the topic came up, you could see he would be really physically uncomfortable.  Some think he may have been closeted, but I dunno.  I'd seen him on dates, and he could catch him a really cute girl.  He was a clothes model for newspapers, but that didn't pay enough, so he did security, too, but it got him introductions to other models.  Nice gig.\n\nBut, one night the students must have done themselves a big shoplifting spree at the drugstore.  Cause all of a sudden I get a radio call from Chuck.\n\n\"They've... they've.... I can't....  Oh, JESUS.   Oh, JESUS!\"\n\n\"What's wrong.  You ok?\"\n\n\"Yeah, but....\"\n\nHe tells me that someone has taken condoms and placed one on each doorknob on every door in the women's dorm.  They apparently filled each with hand cream first, then spread Vaseline on them after, the wrapped that little tube over the door knob.\n\nThere's three or four of us in the office, and we're rolling on the floor.  \n\n\"Say again, 160?\"\n\nThis brings another round of laughter as Chuck haltingly described what he found.  We calm down a bit, and I key the mic again:\n\n\"Well, 160, you probably need to take one off and put it in an evidence bag and bring it in.\"\n\nAgain, we've lost it in the security office.  If someone had walked by, they'd have thought we had a tank of laughing gas in there.\n\n\"Uh.... say again dispatch?\"\n\nSo, I tell him again he needs to get one as an example for his report.  A while later he comes trodding up to the office with a paper bag at the end of his extended arm, muttering and cussing.\n\nWe left it for the boss to look at when he came in on Monday.\n\n",

        "text": "Oh the convoluted tale that led to multiple 80-hour weeks for a poor college sophomore. Warning - wall of text.\n\nBackground: At the time, and this may still be the case, Arkansas had a law on the books where one could not work for multiple security firms. Fine, dandy, I guess it makes sense, somehow.\n\nMore Background: I worked for what used to be a well-known outfit that is seen in a lot of old-west movies (think bowler hats and handlebar mustaches). At the time I started, it had just been bought out with another old firm, both by a foreign entity. There was a LONG process of consolidating the three entities and this Christmas occurred right in the middle of the multi-year process.\n\nLast bit of background: I worked at a small site, the only one within an hour for our side of the company, and it only required 3 1/2 guards, one on duty at any time. The site supervisor had just transferred to Little Rock and his sergeant was promoted and a replacement officer was hired as well as a part-time guy for the weekend day shift. The full-time replacement was just off... everyone could tell that he was \"touched by the angels\" as the genteel southern women say. The part-timer was an older guy who just wanted to supplement his social security checks. The sergeant that got promoted was a pretty cool guy, but ultimately a little wild (remember this point).\n\nSo here's how my december shook out:\n\nFinals week: I report to work for third shift, training angel-boy. He can't focus but hell, it's not a huge deal. He seems ready enough to do the job, despite some weird vibes. Two days into finals week, I am informed that my new supervisor had a dui wreck and demanded to be brought to our hospital where he showed his ass in multiple ways. He is immediately asked to resign. I, as the senior officer with a whopping six months of experience, am promoted in the interim. This leaves me with one other full-time guard (angel-boy), a part-timer who refuses to pick up more than one extra shift, and a guy who also works as a dispatcher for the campus police and can only work two shifts a week.\n\nI report that week to the main office for instructions on my new responsibilities which include being on call for emergencies and faxing in payroll paperwork and making the schedules. I am instructed that overtime is less than desirable. I inquire as to when a replacement can be obtained for our full-time guard and am told that it is unlikely that anyone can be hired until the first of the year and to do what's necessary to fulfill our contract.\n\nAbout a week later I am pulled aside during my rounds by the switchboard operator and told that my night guard, angelboy, has been telling her about hearing voices telling him to harm himself. I create an incident report and fax it in outlining my concerns. Having family in the mental health system in AR, I am not very hopeful about any outcome. It's the weekend, so there are no supervisors available to me, but I figure it can't get worse in a few days. (Remember being young and stupid?)\n\nThe next night I get a call around three am. Angelboy has went off the deep end and tried to cut off his fingers with the bolt cutters we keep in the office. FUCK! So I rush in to work, calling whoever in the office will pick up the phone, and the head manager finally picks up and agrees to come in in the morning to assess the situation. I am then stuck working out his shift as he is treated by our staff, which gossips like nobodies business, and by the end of the night everyone has expressed concerns about having him as a guard at our site. The head supervisor comes in and agrees and he is removed from our site, and rehired on the other side of the company to work another site in town. Hey, fine, I don't want the guy to lose his job because he has problems. But now I am down to one full-time guard (me), two part-time guards, and the whole holiday season to cover. \n\nThankfully, school is now out of session so I can devote the hours I was putting in there to the job. I somehow cobble together schedules that cover all the shifts and I am only working a few doubles a week and I think I had a day off or two in this stretch. But here comes Christmas. One of my guys is on schedule to work the day shift at the University, the other refuses to work for family obligations. Fuck. Sorry, old dude, but I have to put you on the schedule. Management backs me up on this one. I show him that it's only a four hour shift so I can take a nap. I am working 16, taking off 4, and coming back for 8 until the dispatcher can come in.\n\nYou can guess how this goes down. I work afternoon to morning and start looking for my relief. He's a no-show. He won't answer his phone. My bosses won't answer their phones. After being supposed to get off at 7am, I finally reach the head boss at 9am (18hours in) and she says there's nothing she can do. I try my relief some more and about 11am I am hitting the wall. My nurse admin (person in charge when no office people are around) tells me to go hide in a room and get a nap in. I do this for 30 mins, try my relief and my boss again. Boss says she'll make some calls. I hit the wall again about 1pm and go hide again. I am just waking up and walking out the door when the Head Administrator comes around the corner with the nurse admin (who looks worried). He asks me if I've been sleeping on the job. I lied, told him I was very tired from being there since about 22hours ago. Apparently he then called my boss and made a complaint (I was written up for sleeping on the job, whatever) but she finally sends a guard from the other side of the company to relieve me right at the 24 mark. I still don't remember the drive home, but I called in when the dispatcher arrived for work, and satisfied that I was in the clear, I slept through the night.",

        "text": "Before you start reading please excuse my poor english since its not my first language.\n\nNow, i work for a security company in Iceland and i work the backshift. If you are not familiar with that term it basicly means that i'm always on standby to take a job if somebody gets sick or if somebody calls and asks for security for an odd job, and by an odd job i mean unusual contracts which is usually quite discrete. \n\nNow, im the kind of guy that works alot of overtime and never say no to assignments and that means i get quite the amount of odd jobs here and there. Some are very odd and some just plain dangerous.\nAlot of these jobs revolve around patients on hospitals which have lost their minds either as a side effects from painkillers they are taking or just completely lost it from life experience. The latter was a fact in one of my jobs where the hospital had called in to ask for help immidietely and my employer called me up and said i had ten minutes to show up at the hospital because there seemed to be a situation they could not handle taking place in one of the rooms. \nI showed up 7 minutes after my employer had called me to find a female about 29 years of age who was a drug addict and an alcoholic. For all intent and purposes lets say her name was Eva. She was having a pretty severe liver failiure but as you know not in a good mood not being able to do her usual routine stuff (such as injecting herself and drinking). Now you would think a patient with a severe liver failiure would be pretty docile and want medical assistance, this was definetely not the case. I show up and the first thing that i see is the patient throwing anything she could find at the nurses and threatening them with a needle she had in her bag ( i have no idea why she had it with her in the first place it should have been confiscated ofcourse). So the first thing i do is ask the nurses to leave the room and come back when i have calmed things down. \n\nAfter about 15 minutes of talking and me explaining that the nurses were there to help and so was i she calmed down a bit and gave them permission to come in to try and reason with her. I explained to the nurses that she was suffering from severe pain and asked for painkillers which the nurses aggreed to. Now, the first thing eva said to me after i came in the room was that she was a recovering drug addict and had been clean for 3 months (which ofcourse was a load of horse manure). She pretty soon started going through withdrawal after my arrival maybe even before i arrived i cant really remember but this ment she had even more pain and she definetely was not in a good mood because of this. \n\nNow i was told that she had been visited by her mother and her father (they were seperated and did not come at the same time) her father had been an alcoholic and her mother was a drug addict at this time and had been for years. They both loved their daughter but they had their own ways of showing affection, whereas the father would speak to her take her out to smoke some cigarettes and try to help her get through this. Her mother on the other hand had apparently told her to tell the hospital staff to screw themselves and told her to do things the way she wanted because she was the patient and they were \"serving her\" as she would call it, now i know this for a fact because the nurses listened in on this conversation and told me about it before i entered the room. \n\nNow, she had recieved some treatment and was being co-operative shortly after i arrived because all she really wanted was just somebody to talk to but like i said, she was starting to go through withdrawal and always tried to slip away from me unseen to places like the bathroom or some other room but she ofcourse didnt go very far without me knowing since she was in a wheelchair. These attempts were futile and she started to get very frustrated about me having to follow her around every step (except for the bathroom where the nurses provided her with company). She eventually gave up and just started following the rules she had been set for about six hours, until she decided she just didnt have the patience to wait and decided to go out for a smoke where she fired up a joint. Now the first thing i do is seize the joint since marijuana is illegal and alot more taboo here than in most other country's around the world. She threatened to call her friend and make him come and beat me up and i said she was free to do so it really wasnt my business who the heck she called. About 5 minutes later i hear some tires screeching and alot of engine noise and suddenly this Toyota Corolla appeared and crashed (although not very hard) into a wooden fence around some garden there and out came some guy which was obviously Eva's friend and he was pretty high but on what i couldnt really tell.. and he ran to me yelling and cursing at me and demanded that i let Eva smoke what she wanted but i politely explained that she was a patient and it wasnt in the doctors best interest that she had some drug in her system that they were not aware of. But he did not take any reasoning which i had to offer and in the end he decided to take a swing at me (now.. this guy was not very well built like most drug addicts tend to be, he was maybe around 70 kg/140 lbs and about avarage height but i am considerably taller and heavier or 205 cm/6,7ft and around 95 kg/190 lbs and i'm trained in self defence so except for that first hit he didnt get another chance to throw a swing at me and i threw him to the ground and called the police. they were there in about 4 minutes and took the guy away thankfully. \n\nWhile i was having my confrontation with this man Eva rolled to the bathroom to shoot up with ritalin that her mother had provided her with. After that she was not welcome in the hospital so my shift ended pretty quickly which was very positive because my patience was diminshing at a very fast pace. So Eva called some friends of hers which promised to come and pick her up but they seem to have forgotten her and she didnt have anybody to go to or have anybody to pick her up so she ended up waiting in a wheelchair in with an incredible amount of pain for about six hours at which point she gave up and registered herself back in. So about that time i was called again from my employer and the same routine again, i had to get there a.s.a.p but this time it was  very different. \n\nI showed up shortly after the call only to see that Eva was actually happy and thankful to get a bed in the hospital again (this time they decided to drug her with librium and alot of other drugs to work against her withdrawal) and she had actually become polite and a much nicer person and didnt resist at all, finally.. i remember saying to her \" wow, Eva you are a completely different person you even sem a bit polite!\" she actually got offended by this because she actually got out of her way to be impolite to people that she didnt know not to much surprise on my behalf haha. \n\nAfter her second admission to the hospital she slept 20 hours a day because the hospital staff didnt really want her to be out and about while she was there not to anybodys surprise. i did not stay with her all of the time ofcourse i worked in shifts with another guy who didnt have any problems since he only had experience from her being drugged. Its just really sad how this girl has turned out because my friend was in the same class as she was and she was incredibly pretty and smart at one point and did good in school, now she's just a broken down addict staring death in the face without any true friends.. \n\nthis is one of many stories i have experienced i apologize if it was too long, feel free to ask for more since this was pretty much just a textbook assignment from my employer.. i've had much worse ofcourse ",

        "text": "So, it was a night when a couple of the dorms were having what we called \"dorm wars.\"  Guys from one dorm would go do mild vandalism (shaving cream, confetti, and so on) in the opposing dorm, and then some kind of retaliation took place.  We guards would make a mild effort to stop it, but it was about 200 to 1, so we couldn't really do much.\n\nSo, dorm G had enough and just wanted to go to bed, but they expected dorm M to come knocking.  You may recall from another post that the outside door locks on the dorms were pretty bad.  On the men's dorm they were worse.  The students wouldn't want to have to pause to unlock the doors, so they'd just yank on them until they broke the locks again.  So, although we'd \"lock\" the doors, it didn't matter.  And this presented a problem for the men of dorm G.\n\nTheir solution was simple enough.  Use one of those U shaped bicycle locks on the doors. The obvious problem is this prevents anyone from using the doors to come in or out, and one of the guards discovered this shortly.  I was supervising, so I was called.\n\nI contacted the Resident Assistant.  This is a upper classman or grad student who gets free boarding for managing the dorm.  I asked if he could get the student to locked the door to open it back up, but he didn't know who did it.\n\nI guess I could have just blown it off, but I guess I felt since the students constantly yanking the doors caused the problem, they deserved the inconvenience this would cause.\n\n\"Well, I'm going to have to call the dean.\"\n\nThis was unexpected, and a big deal.  When the RA asked why, I told him we can't have students locked inside a building with the fire exits locked shut.  We were going to have to open the doors or evacuate the building.  Now.  At 3 AM.\n\nI suggested the RA go door to door and ask for the student to unlock the door.  Let them know if the lock disappears, you won't report them, but either the door gets unlocked, or everyone gets to spend the night outside.\n\nI left, and shortly after, we found the door unlocked.\n\nAnd, yes, the men of dorm M made another visit.\n\n",

        "text": "In a similar vein as [Poor Kitty](http://redd.it/1dc1gf), we used to have somewhat of a bat problem.  The problem wasn't so much with the bats themselves, but with this one girl who worked with us.  She was soft spoken, super sweet, and very attractive, but she was a **die hard** animal lover.  We'll call her Soledad.\n\nThe mall we worked at was built in the 60s and had some old tenant spaces that were unused and had succumbed to rot and other neglect.  On occasion these spaces would host various critters, one the most common being bats.\n\nEvery once in a while, we would recover an injured or disoriented bat from the common spaces in the mall.  If Soledad was working on one of these days, you could be assured her productivity would plummet like said bat.  Soledad would keep the thing in a shoe box and try to nurse it back to health while waiting for animal control.\n\nUnfortunately, animal control ranked injured bats at the mall very lowly on the priority list.  Many times they would hint at us \"taking care\" of the bat humanely.  Soledad would have none of it.  We handled a couple of the bats without her hearing, but on occasion she would find out.\n\n\"Hey, uh, Drew?\"\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\"Did animal control come get the bat?\"\n\n\"Uh, well, Soledad,\" as I am saying this, the initial look of pure hope and love slowly melted away through hate, into pity, and then deep sadness, \"They said they weren't going to make it out today, and, uh, asked us to take care of it.\"\n\n\"So, how did you take care of it?\"\n\n\"I broke its neck with a stick,\" tears.  Nothing but silent tears that followed her to the bathroom.\n\nAfter she recovered, Soledad approached me and told me she understood why I handled that situation like I did, but requested that next time we try and do more for the bat.  I agreed to settle her down, hoping that I wouldn't find another bat for a while. \n\nMy luck couldn't have been so good.  The very next week another bat was found on Soledad's shift.  She went to collect it, beaming with a glow akin to a child at an amusement park.  She returned to the office with a small, brown bat in a shoe box.  The bat didn't appear to be severely injured; one of the tenants reported that it had fell onto their counter from about seven feet.  It looked a bit confused, but moved well.\n\nAfter letting Soledad babysit the bat for while, we decided we should let it go.  We took the bat and the box and trekked to the roof where we could \"launch\" the bat.  The section of the roof we were on was about 20 feet lower than the roofs of the anchor stores, but high enough that we could see most of the building. \n\nSoledad reached in the box and handed me the bat.  It clung to my gloves for a few minutes before it tried standing and spreading its wings.  When it got up, I gently would raise my hand to kinda fling it into the air.  The bat flaps its wings and finally takes off into the afternoon sky.  \n\nSoledad watched the animal with a massive smile on her face.  I could see her sense of accomplishment, good, and happiness.  \n\nAnd that all changed in about five seconds.\n\nThe bat made it about 50 feet up and 200 feet out until it was directly over one of the anchor stores.  Then it fell like a stone directly on the roof from about 30 feet.  We never saw it get back up.\n\nI turned to look at Soledad.  She stood there slack-jawed.  Completely devastated.  I had no idea what to say, so I just choked out a, \"can't win them all,\" type thing, and headed down off the roof.  Soledad followed a short while later and was completely silent the rest of the day.",

        "text": "At the school, we had rules regarding students of the opposite sex in the dorm after hours.  I'm not a prude, but the rules did make some sense to me especially in the women's dorm.  Some guy in the hall at 3 AM- is he a visitor or an intruder?  I'll tell the story about one intruder a whole floor of women captured another time.\n\nBut Jack took it to another level.  He was a true believer in his religion and he seemed to relish catching others violating the visitation rules.  Perhaps it was that he  only worked dorm duty, but I thought he was a little overzealous.  In fact, they changed the rules to keep guards out of the women's hall (but not the women's lounge where we'd typically stay) after hours, too.  It was rumored he'd walk the halls listening at the doors to see if there were men there after hours.\n\nBut, he could walk the halls of the men's dorm.\n\nSo, from time to time while I'm on patrol I'd get a call from him to come help him catch some woman in the men's dorm.  They'd be loud in the room and he'd just hear them through the door.  He'd call me and I'd go to the outside to catch them coming through the window when he would knock.\n\nBut, sometimes, in fact more often than not, I'd put my finger to my lips and softly go \"Shhhhhh!\"  Then I'd motion them to come on out and let them go.  The student inside would open the door to let Jack in, but no women would be found.\n\nObviously, I had to let him catch a few.  But I don't know if he ever caught on.\n\nIrony tag?  He got his student girlfriend pregnant.  But, he at least was decent about it and married her.  As far as I know, they're married today.",

We have a lot of undeveloped property, and I'd seen a bobcat on our property out in the boonies, but a panther?\n\nI have him call on the phone, and no, it's a kitten.   A feral kitten.  We had lots of them on campus.  But, he can't catch it or shoo it out of the lounge.  We call animal control, and they show up the next morning and cart it off.\n\nMonth later, I'm talking to one of the residents of the dorm who I know, and she tells me that she put the kitten in the lounge to distract Jack where they could sneak beer in the other end of the dorm.\n\nI ask her, \"When animal control took the kitten, what do you think happened to it?  No one will adopt a feral kitten.  Was that good beer?\"\n\nIt took her a minute, but when she realized the kitten was likely put down for their little buzz, she cried like a little girl.  ",

        "text": "Shortly before I became a supervisor at this mall I worked at, we hired a particularly interesting individual.  He was short with a very high pitched voice which came with a Kentucky accent.  On top of his outward appearance, he was quirky to say the least.  Very conservative Christian, but had a strong interest in Japanese culture and weird anime stuff.  He also was exceptionally annoying when he first came on.  He made for some good jokes.\n\nHe ended up getting put on nights which, at the time, I think was 0:00-8:00.  After I was promoted, I was given the horrible position of morning sup.  I would come in every morning, usually 15 minutes late, hungover, and lock myself in the office to start paperwork.  The very first week I had to deal with two very annoying incidents.  \n\nThe second one was pretty basic.  Right after I had arrived, but before Kentucky got off, the evac alarm started going off.  Some work was being done in a tenant space and they started grinding tile which set off the smoke sensors.  The mall was already pretty full of tenants, and they all were flagging me down as I was frantically running for the fire panel asking, \"is this a real alarm?\"  In the mean time, I instructed Kentucky to go meet the fire department and he couldn't stop asking me if he was going to get overtime for this.\n\nThe previous day was not much better.  I came in and sat down at the computer and Kentucky started making his bullshit small talk.  This was obviously ice breaking for what he was about to tell me.\n\n\"So, uh, last night the Segway broke.\"\n\n\"How did that happen.\"\n\n\"Well the right handle fell off.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"It jerked to the right when I was in back hallway and was sheared off by an exposed I-beam.\"\n\n\"What?!  Why were you riding it in the narrow hallway?\"\n\n\"I had received a call from a woman who said she was in the Sears parking lot being followed by a suspicious subject with a chainsaw.\"\n\n\"Chainsaw?\"\n\n\"Uh, yes, that is what she said.\"\n\n\"Do you feel that you are properly equipped to handle someone with a chainsaw?\"\n\n\"Uh, no.\"\n\n\"At any point did you think that may be a prank call?\"\n\n\"Uh, no.\"\n\n\"And did you not think that either way you should call the police to handle that?\"\n\n\"Uh, no.\"\n\n\"Ok, so you violated policy and common sense and damaged a expensive piece of company property in the process.  I am going to need you to write a narrative about last night while I call the boss.\"\n\n\"Ok, I injured myself in the process, should I take pictures of my bruises and document them for worker's comp?\"\n\n\"Sure, do you need medical assistance?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"So, I shouldn't call an ambulance?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Ok, be sure to document that too.\"\n\nOver the next few months, Kentucky remained on graves and kept fucking up, I was promoted again, and the Segway remained broken.  Christmas was about a week away, and our corporate and the client corporate would soon be coming for an end of the year audit.\n\nOne late night my boss calls me, \"You know what I want for Christmas?\"\n\n\"No, you're Jewish.\"\n\n\"I can still have a Christmas wish.\"\n\n\"What do you want?\"\n\n\"I would love it if some Norteños broke into the office, trashed it, and stole the broken Segway before corporate shows up since I never reported the incident.  And, you know, we would have to fire the grave officer on duty...\"\n\n\"That would be a nice Christmas gift.\"\n\n\"Yeah, have a good night, bye.\"\n\n\"Bye.\"\n\nNow, I do not condone felony theft, vandalism, burglary, or trespassing, but at the time it sounded like a great idea.  I immediately called one of the other supervisors and told him we had work to do.\n\nOver the next week, we analyzed the schedule, developed alibis, and made our plan.  Kentucky was going down.  The other supervisor and I went into a hardware store to buy gloves and red spray paint.  The idea was that we would place a fake call from a pay phone to get Kentucky out of the office, let ourselves in with our keys, trash the office, tag it up, grab the machine, and bounce.\n\nRight before it was going to go down, I sent my boss a vague text telling him it was on.  We were parked a block or so from the property waiting for all the housekeeping people to go home.  Almost immediately, he called to call it off.\n\nApparently the other sup who was with me had written this massive report about damage to a Gem cart that received much praise from all the mucky-mucks.  I looked at him and told him he fucked up.  So, we left.  \n\nIn retrospect, we were both very glad we didn't do this and laughed it off.  It almost got very real for us, and we are happy we didn't pull off the job.\n\nCamaraderie can make you do strange things. ",

        "text": "Hello everyone I just found this subreddit and thought I would share a story of my own. \n\nI used to work for a start up Security Company after I got out of the Military. Now the location I worked at was a … lets say negative 1 star hotel, of the extended stay type. So on this nice night I was making my rounds and checking some of the unnoccupied rooms because well there locks sucked and homeless people would from time to time slip in shower and sleep in the beds. If you caught them you just asked them to leave and give them a trespass. They usually didn’t comeback unless it was cold and they wanted to go to jail to keep warm and eat a good meal. \n\nNow on this stellar night everything was fine no homeless people breaking in, no drug dealing going on (I guess they took the night off) and then in comes a call to the security line the couple in room 144 were arguing. Now this is the call I hated the mostly because you never know what’s going to happen, actually because it usually meant I am going back to this room 5-10 more times (the owners of the property wanted us to give them multiple chances before we asked them to leave). \n\nSo I get to the door and knock the male opens the door and I begin to give him my speech please keep the noise down your neighbors are calling and complaining. He then tells me its her fault she is a c$&amp;# and a wh@$*! She should not be such a S#*@ and he is yelling this the entire time. I ask him to calm down, and I then ask the young lady what happened. She tells me he is over reacting to something that means nothing (I don’t remember what it was) now here is the layout of the room there is a bed in the middle of the room against the far wall. Flaked bye two chairs and I am standing on the threshold. A guy comes down the hall and asked if I could answer a question about after our check in. when I looked back the guy was beating his GF in the head with a telephone. Not a cell phone or a cordless phone but a 1992 style office phone. Now I don’t mean just the had set but the entire phone.\n\nNow when I see this I start to walk toward him to stop him from hitting her and he drops the phone and runs right at me as to run me over. Now I used to play football in High school, and On my UNIT team in the Marines. So he hits me and falls on his behind I tell the guy walking down the street to call the cops. Now this is the crazy part. When the police show up I have the guy calmed down sitting on the sidewalk. The police show up I fill out a report and they cuff him and put him in the back of the car. He starts screaming that she has cocaine in the room. The cops rip apart the room looking for it. And find nothing. Then ask him where it was it he starts telling them the  “it in da smoke thang” …”ummm da smoke alarm” so they open it up and sure enough in the smoke alarm in a baggie wrapped around the in side of the alarm. \n\nThe police arrest her as well because she said it was his and he said it was hers and in my state the can arrest all persons who are in proximity of the drugs if no one steps up to take ownership. Now they both go to jail and I issue a notice of tress pass.\n",
