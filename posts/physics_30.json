The more distant there is between galaxies the faster apart they grow too. So much so that some expand further apart than the speed of light. \n\nI’ve thought that instead of thinking of it as expanded. Could we think of it as space being added between these galaxies? As well put by the nobel prize winner Steven Weinberg. “How is it possible for space, which is utterly empty, to expand? How can `nothing’ expand?\nThe answer is space does not expand. Cosmologist sometimes talk about expanding space - but they should know better.”\n\nWhat if the space between galaxies is have space added to it? Where is this added space coming from? Could it be that excess energy produced my galaxies (their stars and so on) adds to the space between them? I’d really appreciate some answers/corrections to my thinking please!",

But I'm very wary as I do not want to confuse myself. \n\nSo far, all I have studied is classical mechanics. I did the MIT opencourseware, classical mechanics as well as the single variable calculus. However, I have not done multi-variable calculus. I have also read the 1st volume in the feynmann lectures. Which covered a little of both quantum and relativity, but not much. I'm not quite sure if this is enough.\n\nI know from historical context that quantum physics and relativity not as intuitive as classical mechanics, and are fundamentally incompatible. Hence I would not only  need to understand the empirical knowledge we've gathered but also, or try my best to use analytical thinking and mathematics. What prerequisites do you think I need to not only grasp what is going on, but the mathematics behind it as well? \n\nYour insights will be greatly appreciated.",

Black holes seem to follow the same rules as the vacuum decay expansion, I.e everything that reaches the a certain point or proximity to the event will 100% be consumed and turned into the singularity, making said thing, wether it’s a planet an asteroid or a star, also reach its final point of stability.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/zzgxhw/hypothesizing_new_approaches_to_plasma/",
        "text": "I admit that my knowledge of physics this advanced is somewhat limited, so if anyone has any deeper insight into the subject, or questions they'd like me to ask the AI, feel free to tell me.\n\nI will provide the most relevant interaction to the topic of this post in the post body, with a full transcript of the interaction in a Google docs link at the end.\n\n&gt;Q: Go into more detail about your proposed \"photon confinement\" method. Provide explanations for your reasoning, and hypothesize potential methods for achieving it.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A: The photon confinement method is a hypothetical approach to fusion confinement that involves the use of photons, or particles of light, to confine and stabilize the plasma. This approach is based on the idea that photons could be used to exert a force on the plasma, and that this force could be used to confine and stabilize the plasma in a fusion reactor.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;One possible method of achieving photon confinement would be to generate a high-energy photon field using some type of advanced technology, such as a high-energy laser or a particle accelerator. This photon field could then be used to exert a force on the plasma, confining it in a stable and predictable manner.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Another potential method of achieving photon confinement would be to use a resonant cavity or other type of photon trap to confine the photons and create a stable photon field. This could involve the use of mirrors, prisms, or other optical elements to reflect and trap the photons, and to create a stable photon field that is able to exert a force on the plasma.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The reasoning behind the photon confinement method is that photons are highly energetic particles that are able to exert a strong force on other particles, and that they could potentially be used to confine and stabilize the plasma in a fusion reactor. However, it is worth noting that the photon confinement method is purely hypothetical at this point, and it is not known if it is feasible or viable as a method of fusion confinement. In order to determine its feasibility or viability, it would be necessary to conduct further research and experimentation to understand the basic principles of this approach, and to develop the technologies and knowledge needed to implement it.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Q: What are some other things to consider regarding the photon confinement approach that you haven't mentioned yet?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A: There are several other things that might need to be considered when attempting to use the photon confinement approach as a method of fusion confinement. Some of these considerations might include:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Photon intensity and energy: In order for the photon confinement approach to be effective, it will be necessary to generate photons with a high intensity and energy. This could be achieved using high-power lasers, or other sources of high-energy photons such as synchrotron radiation.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Photon trapping and confinement: It will also be necessary to develop methods for trapping and confining the photons, such as using resonant cavities or other types of photon traps. This could involve the use of mirrors, prisms, or other optical elements to reflect and trap the photons, and to create a stable photon field.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Plasma-photon interactions: It will also be necessary to understand and control the interactions between the plasma and the photons, including the transfer of momentum, energy, and other properties between the two. This could involve developing new theories and models to describe these interactions, as well as new experimental techniques to measure and characterize them.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Plasma stability and confinement: Finally, it will be necessary to understand and control the stability and confinement of the plasma itself, in order to achieve the conditions necessary for fusion reactions to occur. This could involve developing new theories and models to describe plasma stability and confinement, as well as new experimental techniques to measure and characterize these phenomena.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Q: Has this approach ever been suggested before by anyone?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A: As far as I am aware, the specific approach of using photons for confinement of a fusion plasma has not been widely studied or suggested by researchers in the field. While the use of lasers or other sources of high-energy photons has been explored for various purposes in fusion research, such as heating or accelerating the plasma, the idea of using photons as a means of confinement itself has not been a focus of research to date.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;However, it is worth noting that this does not necessarily mean that the photon confinement approach is not feasible or potentially useful. As with any new idea in science, the feasibility and potential utility of the approach would need to be carefully evaluated through research and experimentation.\n\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QgQrs-iPlzlEZ6ZbCs3zlrqqrLmkduncCwuiqdG25ws/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QgQrs-iPlzlEZ6ZbCs3zlrqqrLmkduncCwuiqdG25ws/edit?usp=sharing)",

        "text": "Hi all! I'd like to ask a question regarding the visual effects of being in a small, closed universe and how attractive/repulsive forces behave within that environment. I've tried finding papers or discussions on this but I can't seem to find the keywords.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVisual Effects:\n\nSay you find yourself in an empty universe (save yourself) that is closed ([hypersphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-sphere)) and has a small volume (20 meters in diameter). Would you be able to see yourself? Would you see a stretched-out image of your own back/back of your head? Would this result in a massive pair of eyes staring at the back of your head? You wouldn't see multiple images of yourself but when you look up, you don't see your own distorted face and instead you'd see the bottom of your feet. You look down and see the top/back of your head. Everywhere you look you see yourself but the image is more or less distorted/stretched. As you look around, the image  will shift accordingly. Would these visual effects be accurate in this environment? Are there any key words I can use to find a visual representation of this? It'd be super trippy and cool to see!  \n\n\nAttractive forces:\n\nIf you threw a rope at your own back, then you'd feel it hit your back, right? What if you grabbed the end of the rope that you threw to yourself and pulled? I'm thinking you won't go anywhere in the same way that you don't move when you pull a rope between your hands in front of you.\n\nIf this is the case, how would attractive/repulsive forces act? A particle producing a gravitational (or another type) field would essentially \"pull outward\" on itself from all directions resulting in no net force and so no movement. But if gravity has a speed and not necessarily a limit to its distance, would the gravitational field continue on to travel through/past that particle and and loop around? What effects would this \"looping gravity\" have on the space around the particle? And a repulsive force? Would this continual looping even be detectable? If needed I can make drawings to clarify lol.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this and any answers you may provide! All the best!",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/zz2hur/i_managed_to_calculate_the_momentum_and_force_of/",
        "text": "For the toy car, it travelled **1.33m** in **2s**, and weighed around **30g**. Since **v=d/delta t**, its’ Vf was **0,665 m/s.** I next had to calculate the momentum, and p=mv, so I got **p=1,995kg-m/s**. Next, I had to calculate the force I was exerting on it. Since F=ma, I first needed to calculate the acceleration. Since acceleration is **Vf-Vi/delta t**, I got a result of **0,3325m/s2.** So, I needed to calculate F, so I converted the grams in kg, and got a result **of 0,09975 N.**\n\nI did the same for the Bugatti. I know it had a mass of **1838 kg**, and could accelerate to **0-100 km/h**, or around **0-27,75 m/s** in **2,25s**. For p, I got **51004,05kg - m/s,** and for a(acceleration), I got a result of around **12,33ms/s2.** So, for F, I got **22662,54 N.**\n\nThe SLS was a bit more complicated, though. I only had data for the SLS 118s after liftoff, and I had to work my way up to 131 seconds, which was **where the two SRBs jettisoned from the SLS.** I know the SLS had a mass of **2494758kg**, and I calculated v. At 118s after liftoff, the SLS was **16,5 miles** away from LC-39B at the Kennedy Space Center, or around **265km, or 275000m.** So, I did **275000 divided by 118**, and got a speed of **2245,76 m/s.** Based on these results, I calculated a(acceleration), and got an acceleration of **19,03m/s2**. Since I wanted the data at 131s after liftoff, I first calculated the time in seconds between 118s and 131s, and got a result of 13s. So, to find the speed at which the SLS was going 131s after liftoff, or when the two SRBs jettisoned from the SLS, I did **2245,76+19,03 x 13,** and got a **VF of 2493,15 m/s.** I next calculated a, which was the exact same ;**19,03 m/s2.** So, you could say that what I just did was pretty useless, since I got the same acceleration. What was I expecting? Anyways, next, I calculated p (because p=mv), and got a result of **6 219 805 907,7kg - m/s.** Next, I calculated F, and got **47 475 244,74 N.**   \nAnyways, here are the final results:\n\nToy Car: **F=0,09975N ; p= 1,995kg - m/s**\n\nBugatti( Veyron Super Sport): **F= 22662,54N ; p= 51004,5kg - m/s**\n\nSLS(up until 131s after liftoff): **F = 47 475 244,74 N ; p= 6 219 805 907,7kg - m/s**\n\n**By the way,** this is the first time I do something like that, so let me know if I got something wrong. I’m sure I might have. Thanks a lot!",
