When Thai food was served, the thai participants absorbed more iron than the swedish participants, despite the meals being exactly the same. When swedish food was served, the swedish participants absorbed more iron than the thai participants, despite the food having the exact same nutrients as well.\n\nNow there is the assumption that the swedish people absorbed more iron from the swedish meal over the thai meal because they enjoyed the swedish meal and disliked the thai meal and vice versa with the thai participants.\n\nBut I just can't believe that this is the actual reason. Does anyone know what really causes the difference in absorption?\n\nMy guess would be Evolution. That swedish people have evolved to process typical swedish food more efficiently, while Thai people have evolved to process typical Thai food more efficiently.\n\nThe second part of the study just says that people abaorb less iron from overly homogenized (blended) food over non homogenized (not blended) food, which is easily explainable without the factor of taste",

There is storage under my bunk so I could stock up on stuff; obviously I can't have anything refrigerated either. \n\nI'm through using protein shakes for now and want to try new things. \n\nAny ideas of things I could try out?",

However, looking at his website the first picture shows him with a bunch of fruits, honey and cheese. When using the calculator on his website it recommends eating a lot of fruit and honey too. The diets recommended in his book \nwould put you in ketosis, but not the one on his website.\n\nDoes anyone know why there's a difference? Did he change his thinking since writing the book?",
