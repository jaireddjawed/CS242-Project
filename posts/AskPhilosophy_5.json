        "text": "I'm new in this 'academic' sphere of philosophy but I've been interested for a while.  \nAcademic writing seems to always be the rambling-on of a person. Sometimes those ramblings are structured well or the idea is clearly explained, and those are amazing to read. Regardless, a lot of them would probably do fine with (at most) a page or two of dot-point premises, sub-conclusions and conclusions. We as readers have to do that anyway, and maybe I'm just lazy but honestly I feel like this way of writing would help us in many ways. It would allow us to figure out implicit assumptions, we could analyse each dot-point individually and expand upon it or classify it as \"statistically invalid\" or \"controvertial\" or whatever. Why don't we do that?\n\n(you might say because it is sometimes difficult to express your idea in dot points because they are very complex. Perhaps this would be a 'summary' version of the whole argument?)\n\nPut another way, we can think about 'meta-science' as asking the question 'how do we make sure the scientific method explores reality in the best way possible?'. Our conclusion has come with the hypethesis/literature review/method (independent var/dependent var/control)/discussion etc.\n\nWhat has been the advancement in the study of 'meta-philosophy'? How do we make sure that ideas of metaphysical/ethical/aesthetic etc. are explored in the best way possible by scholars?",

If stealing was accepted as a universal accepted practice, society wouldn't function. Therefore one should not steal.\"\n\nIn this example the moral validity of an action is measured by its consequences on a large scale, but Kantian ethics is generally portrayed as opposed to consequentialism. Examples like this are fairly common. I have to add that not the immediate consequences of an action are taken into account, but rather on an abstract level (maybe this is the difference of consequentialism and Kantian ethics).\n\nSo my question is: What marks the clear distinction between Consequentialism and Kantian ethics / duty ethics? \n\nI hope this question isn't dumb :D\n\nThank you.

Im not gonna summerize it but if someone eally wants to help im happy to DM. \nMy argument is he contradicts himself throughout by arguing for moral obligations that he himself says do not map onto practical realities. My reasoning is as follows\n\nSinger says the best outcome wouldn't be achieved from everyone doing what they really ought do, which i understand to mean give everything they possible can until the point of equal moral significance. He is saying practically that would create an overabundance, but one is still morally obligated to do it, which I find contradictory. \n\nSinger is saying that other people's contributions to relieve suffering is a relevant factor to the circumstances of the suffering, and can change how much you are obligated to contribute in order to achieve relief. Singer then says that how many other people are in the position as you in regarding the suffering has no baring on one's moral obligation, and it would be better if people contributed while being unaware of others contributions, which seems to be contradict him saying that the contributions of others is practically relevant.",

Pro-capitalist vs pro-communist and so on. \n\n I probably identify as liberal. But when I watch people like Jordan Peterson and Milton Friedman present their arguments for conservative beliefs it can make a lot of sense.  \n\nFor example I just watched a YouTube interview of Milton Friedman giving an explanation why minimum wage / equal pay for equal work is actually an anti-black and anti-feminist law. \n\nIt takes away Black Americans advantage of being able to work for lower wages in exchange for Experience. So that they can eventually reach the point of having enough experience where they can now apply to jobs and earn a higher wage. \n\nSo the black Americans who are already disadvantaged because of poor education via government schooling end up unemployed not gaining experience or knowledge and therefore only compounding their disadvantages in life.\n\nAnd then for a woman trying to have a career that men naturally have an advantage in (firefighting) you take away their only competitive advantage of being able to offer their services for a lower wage. Which leads to the profession being completely male dominated. \n\nOfc maybe given enough time and reasoning you can come up with arguments why Jordan Peterson or Milton Friedman are wrong or vice versa. And you can have a back and forth potentially forever on a single political point. \n\nTherefore how does one know their political beliefs / ideologies are right? Does that make pretty much all ideologies pretty much meaningless? Because you can infinitely argue for almost any ideology and make it sound or reasonable given enough time?",

This has come up in recent discussions about AI, where it seems most people are absolutely certain that AI isn't conscious, yet people will also state that they are certain that animals are conscious, all without knowing what causes consciousness.\n\nMy view on this is: we don't really know what causes consciousness to exist, but I know that my brain has the mechanisms necessary to make consciousness, since I am conscious. It's also pretty certain that other humans have this mechanism in their brain, so I'm pretty sure they are conscious too. \n\nAs for everything else, I don't think we can determine that with any degree of certainty. For example, are cats conscious? I don't think we can actually know this, and I don't mean that in the kind of \"radical skeptic\" way. There are parts of the human brain which are unique to us, and it's not unlikely that these parts of the brain are what give us consciousness. If that were true, then cats may not be conscious at all. Therefore, it is not unlikely that cats do not have any consciousness. The same argument can apply to any animal, or even an AI. With that in mind, how do people seem to know what is and isn't conscious, despite not knowing the root cause of the phenomenon?",

        "text": " \n\nI hope this is the right sub to post this!\n\nSince  the beginning of this year I have been writing short stories, generated  by playing solo rpgs. I've posted two stories now, one short part every  week. in between these stories I write posts about learning to play  solo rpgs and learning to write short stories.\n\nIn  this weeks post I look at the interplay of different rulesets in  writintg these stories. On one hand, there a the rules of the game,  which in solo rpgs consist of surprising yourself in the world you  design for yourself by rolling on random tables or consulting oracles.  You have an idea, and you change that idea mechanically. On the other  hand, there are heuristics which work in writing: show don't tell,  arrive late leave early, etc. There two 'rulesets influence eachother in  interesting ways.\n\n[Here](https://teigills.substack.com/p/philosophizing-with-the-hammer-playing?sd=pf)  is the post. My question is: do you perhaps know of other sources in  game design, writing or philosophical texts that are about the emergence  of new rules by different rulesets?",

Someone, who hasn't tasted a salty apple, but has previously tasted an apple and also has tasted salt, can imagine what the salty apple might taste like based on his past experiences and thus give rise to a subjective experience. I got this idea from a paper by David Lewis titled \"What experience teaches us.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I'm interested in hearing your thoughts, is this criticism valid given that the person is only imagining the taste?

        "text": "Because when I ask myself what exactly I *thought* free will was, I find that I can't even put it into words. That's quite interesting. Normally when something is disproven, you can still behold and contemplate what it was, but with this, I can't even form the concept in my head properly.\n\nThe closest I can come to is this quote: \"Man can do what he wills, but man cannot will what he wills.\" And that second part, 'cannot will what he wills', seems to touch upon what I thought free will was.\n\nBecause it isn't the ability to decide to decide. When I still \"believed\" in free will, I thought there was a higher level of choice that went even beyond the limits of one's circumstances.\n\nFor example, if someone struggled with procrastination, I thought in some way they were 'choosing' procrastination and that they just had to summon enough 'will' to overcome it, and that it was a moral failing on their part if they couldn't. It was that if you didn't have enough willpower you just had to 'will' that willpower.\n\nAnd I thought that because everyone talked *as if* it were true. \"Stop being lazy,\" or \"Pull yourself up by your bootstraps,\" and \"Just do it.\" \"How do I just do it?\" \"What do you mean 'how', just do it!\"\n\nAnd so I thought that if I failed to 'just do it', it must be because somehow, on some level I couldn't describe, I was *choosing* to not 'just do it'.\n\nIt was only until I realized free will doesn't exist, that I started to question how this thought could even make sense. I started to think of myself as an animal that is pushed and influenced by my environment, rather than an independent soul, whose more merit is determined by the capacity to resist external influence.\n\nNo I *am* the external influence, it *makes* me. What I considered to be my 'will' is just one part of a feedback loop. And now this belief is so utterly well understood that I struggle to even recall what it was that I previously believed in. I mean, how would you even define 'that' thing? How could will or decision exist independently of influence? That would just be pure randomness, and randomness isn't a choice. But yet everyone seems to believe what I used to believe.\n\nIt seems ludicrous that the majority of the human race intuitively believes in a concept so flimsy that it literally evaporates when you try to define it. And why is that? If it's an illusion, what makes it so? Is there a name for phenomena like this, where it can only be understood when you don't think about it too hard (squinting your eyes, so to speak)?",

Even if we agree that no one has free will, that doesn‚Äôt mean their body shouldn‚Äôt be punished for actions that harm others. \n\nEven aside from punishment, the person I was discussing this with took the position that we shouldn‚Äôt feel guilt, shame, remorse or regret for anything since we aren‚Äôt ultimately responsible for our choices. That sounds nice in that we have a way to avoid those bad feelings, but if we accept this position, then we also shouldn‚Äôt feel happy, grateful or content for any choices we make since we can‚Äôt take credit for anything we do.

If one feels empathy, does this mean that one lacks the capacity to discipline oneself from this impulse? The older I get, the greater is the control of the prefrontal cortex of my behavior: effectively, it loses its spontaneity. I am effectively incapable of spontaneously believing anything. Years of reflection have led me to recognize that I do not possess free will, and as I proceeded with this materialistic interpretation of my own subjective experience, certain things became untenable. A recent disillusionment was other people: if I interact with someone, I am incapable of differentiating whether this act itself is pleasurable (as it was before), or if the knowledge thus obtained is simply deemed useful and thus acquired. I don't know whether it's a positive development or not. However, if I'm becoming increasingly evil, then what exactly is wrong with evil? \n\nThat I was gifted was already obvious when I was 7. Eventually, it was possible for me to skip classes, but my father refused to allow this over fear that I'd become asocial. The effect? I rebelled and stopped caring about school (becoming significantly more asocial than I would have otherwise), having never studied for it since, and acquiring great results anyway, such as 9th place nationally in a competition. In 2021 I was diagnosed with dyslexic dysgraphia, and it also happened to mention that my IQ is 3 standard deviations above average. I do not possess any other disorders. I was told at a young age that I'm a direct descendant of Nogai Khan. I used to think that this is my historian uncle's cope, but let me quote from the founder of psychology, Henry James:\n\n&gt;Thus, when a superior intellect and a psychopathic temperament coalesce...in the same individual, we have the best possible conditions for the kind of effective genius that gets into the biographical dictionaries. Such men do not remain mere critics and understanders with their intellect. Their ideas posses them, they inflict them, for better or worse, upon their companions or their age.‚Äù\n\nI can't possibly ignore the continuous evidence for possessing the blood of a person who created the greatest land empire in human history and murdered 40 million while at it. I have become a consistently profitable daytrader with ease and look like a fashion model, my brother's appearance is likewise above-average and his IQ is 2SD above average thus outperforming his peer with ease, whereas my father possesses perfect pitch and possesses extremely good memory regradless of many of his shitty decisions. If Nokhai's name was borne by a country to honor him, what's wrong with me following in his footsteps and engaging in whatever evil actions that he has?",

        "text": "For the following views expressed by several fictional characters, which philosopher's ideas are they embracing? \n\nSaga in a nutshell: \"I don't trust the person in charge to protect us for I believe she is not strong enough to defend us from outside threats therefore I will seize power by force from her to prove my point as I feel I'm the one who is more able to protect you all.\" Context is a theocracy with the character wanting to go against the goddess in charge of the community and turn it into his autocracy.\n\nDeathmask: \"The definitions of Right and Wrong are not very clear since they change with the times. It's obvious if you look back on the History of Mankind. Those who are considered evil shall be looked upon as justs if they claim victory in the end. When the Justs are defeated they automatically become Evil. Do you understand? Even if the current Pope (our current ruler) is considered Evil, he will become what is considered Just soon enough.\"\n\nDohko (in response to Deathmask): \"It is impossible for Evil to become Just. The History of Mankind that you spoke of is the greatest proof of that. Many Empires have tried but no matter how powerful or massive their armies were, they have always met with ruins and long been forgotten. That is the fate of all those that let themselves be corrupted by power. Evil cannot be anything other than Evil. True Justice is eternal and no amount of time will change that, like the great flow of these waterfalls, no man can change the fundamentals of Nature.\"\n\nShaka: \"I stand among the ranks of Athena's most honorable knights. We all have the duty to fight and uphold Justice and we should never fight on behalf of Evil. The only truth in this universe is that nothing is certain. Pure Evil, nor pure Righteousness, actually exists here. No matter who stands before me, I can tell you which side they're aligned with. The current Pope (the current ruler) that I saw is undoubtedly... Righteous. That is why I should not show any kind of hostility towards him.\"\n\nShura in a nutshell: \"Because even those I regarded as honorable and as paragons of virtues were not, I lost faith in honor and virtues as a whole and now accept, by turning a blind eye, to follow directives that would have once appeared to me as dishonorable or unjust.\"      \n\nCamus in a nutshell: \"It is acceptable and commendable for people to feel emotions but not for us soldiers because they are weaknesses holding us back that can get us killed.  \n\nAphrodite: \"Absolute power is what Justice truly is. Might makes right. So long as the Pope continues to wield the immense power required to rule Sanctuary, then he himself is the very symbol of Justice. It's only natural, the only reason the world has enjoyed peace for so long is precisely because the Pope enforced it.\"",

        "text": "David Lewis was one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century. One of his unique contributions to metaphysics was the development of a theory he termed ‚ÄòHumean Supervenience‚Äô. This metaphysical theory claims that there is nothing to reality except the spatio-temporal distribution of local natural properties. According to him, there are identifiable fundamental physical objects at points in spacetime. Lewis famously described this view by saying that ‚Äúall there is to the world is a vast mosaic of local matters of particular fact, just one little thing and another‚Äù. Lewis is seen as the main defender of this neo-Humean metaphysical paradigm. \n\nHowever, this view has come under attack with the advent of the quantum revolution in modern physics. The phenomenon of quantum entanglement (non-locality) implies that there are features of the micro-world that appear to display non-separability and this is in contrast to the neo-Humean metaphysical paradigm as it undermines metaphysical atomism/ontological reductionism and implies a version of ontological holism (the whole is greater than the sum of its parts). Jonathan Schaffer, along with many others, is a philosopher that argues for this position. \n\nHowever, some defenders of the neo-Humean mosaic have attempted to overcome this severe problem by amending their conception of Humean Supervenience. After doing some further reading, it appears that there maybe a possible response a person committed to neo-Humean metaphysics can utilise. This has come to be known as ‚ÄúBohumeanism‚Äù (or ‚ÄúSuper-Humeanism‚Äù). Bohumeanism seeks to defend Humeanism against the non-separability argument (as I explained before many philosophers believe that quantum mechanics implies and motivates ontological holism) derived from entanglement (non-locality). It rejects relational holism (as adding modal relations to the neo-Humean mosaic destroys Humean Separability) and rejects wave function realism (as moving the tiles of the mosaic into a high-dimensional space may destroy the picture). \n\nBohumeanism strategy is to argue that primitive ontology is consistent with Humean Separability (i.e., the ontology is separable) and that POA (primitive ontology approach) laws are consistent with physical statism and Humean Separability (i.e., there is a coherent Humean account of laws). Primitive ontology is a response to the debate over the true ontological nature of the wave function. The primitive ontology approach claims that there is ‚Äòmatter‚Äô (or ‚Äòlocal beables‚Äô) in 3D space (or 4D spacetime). Each separate element has a determinate position. Macroscopic objects are made of matter eg. pointers or measuring devices, which have definite positions. The wave function is a law (or a power). It‚Äôs physical significance derives from its *dynamical role* in the temporal development of the matter. Any law for the evolution of the primitive ontology will be highly non-local. \n\nSo, the first step for Bohumeanism (or Super-Humeanism) is to argue for a separable ontology ‚Äî effective wave functions concerns the relative motion of the primitive ontology. Primitive ontology follows non-local Bohmian law of motion. The second step is to argue for a Humean law. \n\nAccording to powerists, this law of motion manifests one (or more) intrinsic power(s). But according to Humeans:\n\nH1: Physical Statism: All facts about the world, including modal and nomological facts, are determined by (or supervene upon) the total physical state of the world.\n\nH2: Humean Separability: The total physical state of the world is determined by/supervenes upon:\n1: the intrinsic physical state of each spacetime point (or pointlike object)\n2: the spatiotemporal relations between those points\n\nBohumeans appeal to 'Best System Account' of laws: this law is just a systematic summary of the facts that balances theoretical virtues.\n\nSo, is Bohumeanism (or ‚ÄúSuper-Humeanism‚Äù) a successful response from the defenders of Humean metaphysics when it comes to making quantum mechanics compatible with that paradigm? Or is this metaphysical model of the physical world layered with problems? Cheers.",

The rock is also a perfectly ordinary, mindless rock, which isn't important to anyone, which can't experience pain, and isn't capable of suffering, or anything in general. \n\nIs attacking the rock still immoral? If the most immediate reason is because of virtue ethics or moral relativism, what if it were virtuous to attack rocks, and it were considered relatively moral to attack rocks?\n\nAnd, if we suppose the rock is not a crystal or other material which can slowly regenerate itself, is there a version of morality where it's more immoral to gently scratch the rock than it is to harm infinite living beings reversibly but viciously?",

Do they in fact have other value, and how does their valuing differ from our valuing withing the symbolic exchange?",

You could say your life purpose is to fart as much as possible.\n\nThe more I think about it, the more those terms seem meaningless when applied to life or the world as a whole. The only inherent purpose of all beings is to procreate (and to survive). I think there can be no other life purpose/meaning. Everything else is secondary. \n\nHowever in our world we have no need to procreate or survive. Humanity will go on without me or my children and so will the people around me. We have basically reached a point where the individual doesn't really matter anymore.\n\nI hope this makes sense. Just some thoughts I had.",

        "text": " \n\nThe idea that there is a thin line between what is considered ethical and non-ethical has been nagging at me lately, im interested in other people's opinions on this especially with regards to jobs. Ill give some examples:\n\nThe bully that bullied you in school... he taught you some serious lessons in life, he made you mentally tough and resillient, he humbled you enough to understand that there is always a bigger fish, he may have driven you to go to the gym, learn self-defence ect.\n\nThe greedy stock market trader on wall street earning millions of dollars a year that you all hate... he payed a ridiculous amount in taxes - much more than you ever payed, he is responsible for helping open up that new public school indirectly through taxes. Many argue that traders are 'regulating the market', essentially finding 'bubbles' (when the companies stock evaluation is inproportionate to it's 'true' value), allowing for greater economic growth.\n\nSay a paramedic makes $80,000 a year - pays 15k tax. Who is better - the investment banker who gave (unwillingly) 5 million dollars to the government which helped funded 5 MILLION DOLLARS WORTH of hospital equipment which helped saved countless lives, or the paramedic who saved 30 LIVES this year and only gave 15k??? Giving money to a middle-aged homeless man... are you not encouraging his behavior? Sure it won't make any realistic behavioral change by not giving him, but are you not decreasing the probability of him turning his life around by 0.1%? 0.1%, in-large, is significant.\n\nThe online 'nigerian prince' that stole $1000 from you... did that not teach you a lesson? After all, you will likely be extremely less gullible to future scams - I mean if he didn't scam you it would have been someone else anyway... right? What about the social media companies 'connecting the world'... all tiktok does nowerdays is make kids less ambitious, satisfying their boredom and giving them the dopamine hit they crave, not so-dissimilar to a drug. Not to mention all the vanity that ultimately drives instagram and facebook ect. Are all the software engineers really such good people? AI - that's a big one... so many jobs lost in the future.\n\nWhat about white lies... telling your friend you like their dress, or their haircut looks good. If you tell them it looks bad, are you being a bad friend by offending them, or are you doing them a disservice as they will likely get a similar haircut in the future?\n\nAnd lastly the greatest issue I have - the idea that all morality and ultruism - is inherintly selfish. Why would a psychopath not give to charity? Because he FEELS no emotional benifit... every person who does anything good, one could argue that it is for themselves and the hit of whatever neurochemicals in the brain they so enjoy after doing something they deem to be 'moral'.\n\nMy point being... How thin is the line???\n\nIf there is a God, how would he judge people and determin where we go after we die?\n\nInterested in what people think about this.",
