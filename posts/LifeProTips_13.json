My checking accounts are no fee accounts. \n\n1) I set up automatic bill payments, so that every paycheck I pay half of every bill. Eg. If my phone bill is $60/month, I pay $30 every paycheck. \n\n2) Some bills just come straight out of my account once a month, like condo fees, loan payments, insurance. For those, I set up a second checking account that they come out of. Every paycheck, I transfer half of those bills to the second account. \n\n3) I set up automatic savings - every paycheck, a certain amount is transferred to savings. \n\n4) Whatever is left in my first checking account is for gas and groceries and other spending. I try to gas up on payday, too.\n\nThe goal is to have some money left in the account  by the next payday. If there is money left, I can spend it on something I want or I can save it.\n\nBecause most bills are monthly, and my payments are biweekly, I am always slightly overpaying many bills. I regularly look at my bills to check for discrepancies, and every once in a while, I skip a bill payment.\n\nFor electricity, I signed up for an equal payment plan, so every month my electricity bill is the same.\n\nFor groceries, I get HelloFresh and eat it for supper and leftovers for lunch. I don't eat breakfast. So, most of my grocery bills are consistent, I just go to the grocery store for things like coffee and cream.",

Our uni allows us to do the thesis in any university, as long as the professor accepts. So I thought that would be a great opportunity, because if I complete my thesis under the supervision of a professor at a reputable uni, that would open the door to doing my masters at a decent uni (perhaps the same one that I’m aiming to do my thesis at). \n\nIt is worth noting that I haven’t done any research related to CS before. Also, I only have projects on my portfolio (GitHub) related to software engineering, and I want to do my thesis on AI/Computer vision. However, I am taking computer vision and machine learning courses in my uni this semester, and I have worked on two or three projects related to this field before.\n\nWhat should I write in my email to the professor? And should I do like 10 mini projects (related to AI/computer vision) this week and upload them to my GitHub before sending the email? And if I do so, wouldn’t the professor doubt that I just uploaded 10 projects in a short period and haven’t done any work related to the field before?",

        "text": "I want to share my personal experience with you to emphasize the importance of taking care of your oral health. Losing three teeth and having to get six crowns before the age of 21 was an absolute nightmare. It left me with a dental state that resembles that of a 50-year-old man, and it could have been prevented if I had access to proper dental treatments and if my dentist had diagnosed and treated my oral complications before they worsened.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know firsthand how easy it is to overlook dental health, but I urge you to prioritize it. Don't rely on only one dentist, as it's important to get a second opinion if you feel that something isn't right. The last thing you want is to find out that you're overpaying for services that should be affordable and accessible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy experience left such an impact on me that I left my job as Chief Aerospace Engineer to prioritize preventative dental care. I'm using my background in AI and engineering to make dental care more accessible and affordable for people like me, who have gone through the same nightmare.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease, take care of your teeth and gums. Don't ignore any symptoms or dental problems you may be experiencing. Go for regular check-ups, and seek a second opinion if you feel that your dentist isn't doing their job correctly. Remember, prevention is always better than cure. Let's prioritize our oral health and avoid the nightmare that I went through.",

Also, I only have projects on my portfolio (GitHub) related to software engineering, and I want to do my thesis on AI/Computer vision. However, I am taking computer vision and machine learning courses in my uni this semester, and I have worked on two or three projects related to this field before.\n\nWhat should I write in my email to the professor? And should I do like 10 mini projects (related to AI/computer vision) this week and upload them to my GitHub before sending the email? And if I do so, wouldn’t the professor doubt that I just uploaded 10 projects in a short period and haven’t done any work related to the field before?",
