        "text": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/classified-documents-found-bidens-wilmington-home-garage-white/story?id=96390141\n\nIn the last week, media sources are reporting that classified documents from Biden's time as Vice President have been discovered sitting unsecured in multiple unauthorized locations, including a think tank (the Penn Biden Center) and in a garage in his home in Delaware. The President held a press conference today where he addressed the issue as follows:\n\n&gt;\"I’m gonna get a chance to speak on all this -- God willing -- soon. But as I said earlier this week, people, and by the way, my Corvette’s in a locked garage,\" Biden said. \"So, it's not like it’s sitting on the street.\"\n\n&gt;\"But as I said earlier this week, people know I take classified documents and classified material seriously. I also said we're cooperating fully and completely with the Justice Department's review. As part of that process, my lawyers reviewed other places where documents in my -- from my time as vice president were stored and they finished the review last night,\" Biden continued, echoing an earlier White House statement. \"They discovered a small number of documents with classified markings in storage areas and file cabinets in my home and my personal library.\"\n\nFamously, former President Trump has also been dealing with legal problems relating to his own mishandling of classified documents that he took back with him to Mar a Lago after his presidency was over. To be clear, there are differences between the two - for example Biden's lawyers cooperating with authorities while Trump's lawyers not cooperating. However, this still brings to mind several questions of interest:\n\n1) Is there some systemic failure with the federal government's system of tracking and securing classified documents, now that we know multiple presidents apparently are able to take them and store them at will in unsecured locations? Could this process be improved?\n\n2) Since politics and optics is everything on Capitol Hill, does this make it more difficult for the DOJ's ongoing efforts to prosecute Trump? Could we see pressure to drop the investigation or soften it, for concern that it may come back to hurt Biden himself either legally or in the court of publi opinion as he prepares for a 2024 re-election run?",
