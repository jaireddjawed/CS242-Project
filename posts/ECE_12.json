When input of the opamp is relatively high(0.2V) slew rate seems higher than when input is low(0.01V). But after 0.2V increasement in voltage doesn't affect the slew rate at all. It stays constant. I think as the output of opamp gets close(0.03V) to 30 times(gain) the input, opamp slows down. But I don't know why it happens or if it only happens with specific opamps. I hope someone can enlighten me on this subject.",

Sorry if this question has nothing to do with the subreddit or is against the rules. \n\nA few years ago (~2005), I discovered that some crazy geniuses had managed to recreate the NES (Nintendo Entertainment System) and fit it under a tiny little black blob of goo. NOACs (Nintendo on a Chip) used to be extremely common, and it was not hard to find a clone console that used a NOAC to play NES games. In fact, I think all NES clone systems used one. \n\nA few years later, I decide that I want an NES. But not the real console, a clone one, because those are much cheaper. And it turns out that people are no longer making those! So I'm out of luck. Which led me to think: if those clone consoles used to be so common, it must not be so hard to make a NOAC! How hard could somehow recreating hardware be? Those chinese guys managed to do it so much! \n\nAaaand this led me here. I tried looking up online more information about how NOAC's are made, but found nothing. I probably won't be able to make one, but I am really interested in at least how one works. Can somebody help me figure that out? \n\nThanks!",

Is there a certain way I should connect the LED voltmeter rather than just having the red and yellow wire connected to the same rail?\n\nAny help is appreciated and I would be happy to clear things up in the comments if more information is needed.

From what I’ve observed most of their problems come with bad code and not planning the designs way ahead.\n\nMy advice to them has been to draw state diagrams and identify all the operating states and the translations first. Following that I’ve told them that they can flesh out the control signals for the data processing pipelines and modules based on these states. \n\nIt would be good if we can make this a thread about design resources, best practices and talk about things they teach outside of the class room. For instance is the advice I’m giving them wrong ? What are the coding practices that would optimize the for efficient synthesis, what are good ways to construct verilog code that for specific things.\n\nThanks !",

If the battery is also supplying current to another IC while it is charging, will this change the current value the lithium ion battery drops down to? Or will the lithium ion battery always drop down to the same current no matter what it is also supplying? Also, how do you know what current the battery will drop down to?",

Storm32 has some promise, but the firmware is only provided in binary format for STM32F103RCT6 MCUs. I would like to use this existing hardware and develop an open source firmware for this, most likely within the arduino environment (unless low level timers and interrupts and DMA becomes too challenging.) Allowing then anyone to port the code to whatever MCU they please (so long as it has the hardware peripherals necessary. The ATmega328p for instance lacks enough hardware timers, unless I use an external PWM chip like those used for driving LEDs.)\n\nI have (mostly) figured out how to control a brushless 3 axis motor *reasonably* well (although my approach is fairly nieve, just blasting it with a 3 phase signal created by sin(angle), sin(angle+120), sin(angle-120)) But if anyone here knows a better way to drive a brushless motor (other than treating it like a shitty stepper motor) please let me know!\n\nThe part that is baffling me is how to determine the current angle of the craft with respect to horizon or level, and therefore how to correct the angle. With a static position, this is trivial. Just measure the instantaneous acceleration in X, Y, and Z and this data will contain only the \"gravity vector\" which of course points down at 9.8m/s\\^2. But if I get the craft accelerating, the data is spoiled by the addition of an \"acceleration vector.\" Not only this, but the vectors for both acceleration and gravity are going to point in many different directions as my craft moves around. Sure, they might be correlated in some obfuscated way, (unless not. Suggestions?)\n\nThe gyro data could be used as well, which returns rotational rates about X, Y and Z. This can then be integrated to provide roll, pitch, and yaw, but this \"dead-reckoning\" method is susceptible to noise and especially small offsets, or \"railing\" (exceeding the scales) which results in horrible errors and drift after a while. So this clearly will not work by itself.\n\n(p.s.  I have an accelerometer, gyro, and a compass. (a couple MPU6050s and an MPU9250)",

        "text": "https://imgur.com/a/Hxpx6lf\n\nSo I am trying to understand how input offset voltage is trimmed or corrected by using current injection. So we have a folded cascoded with PMOS input ( I didn't draw the rest of the circuit). INT and IPT pins are used to inject current if we sense current mismatch. My past questions have been answered by IC design professional here so  I figured, someone can help me understand this. \n\n1) So say we the offset voltage is represented by a voltage source connected in series with the non-inverting input, Vp+. This makes the current flowing through Mp2 larger than the current flowing through Mp1. So in this case I would inject current through the IPT pin to make the voltage at the drain of MP2 higher, the drop across it lower, lowering the current flowing through Mp2, thereby trimming the offset. Is this a correct way of going about things? Is current injection a common way of trimming offset when you don't want to use chopper amplifiers and want to deal with continuous time signal? \n\n2) say a commercial chip has a bunch of comps, opamps, otas etc. If it is critical, do these chips monitor offset at startup and using A/D, D/A  converters, use programmable fuses to lock the offset to the desired value? I guess what I am asking is, is trimming done always at testing/ startup once or do we do it all the time the chip is powered on/off? \n\nI am sorry if the second question seems to be rambling, but I had no idea how to phrase it properly. I just want to know how offset voltage is trimmed in chips without the use of dynamic techniques like in choppers. ",

I'm not sure about the resistance of solder, however, or of using through-hole resistors --- what material do they use for leads? [24AWG copper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_wire_gauge#Tables_of_AWG_wire_sizes) has a resistance of roughly 84 milliohm/m = 84 microohm/mm so that shouldn't be a concern if lead length varies by 1mm.\n\nNot sure of the tempco either; 100mA -&gt; 0.1W dissipation in a 10 ohm resistor, 0.5W dissipation in a 50 ohm resistor, which tells me I should probably avoid small surface-mount devices.\n\nExpense is a minor consideration; I've seen some $30 TO-220 resistors from Vishay but this is still a fraction of the cost of the transducer itself.\n\nSuggestions?",

        "text": "I found this exercise in a textbook. The question is asking to find the transfer function, G(s) = VL(s)/V(s) using mesh analysis and nodal analysis. I worked out the solution with mesh analysis but could not solve with nodal analysis.\nThe solution is G(s) = (s^2 + 2*s + 1)/(s^2 +5*s + 2)\nMy steps are as follows:\n1) Transform the circuit\n2) Find 3 equations and 3 unknowns using KCL at three nodes\n3) Solve for the unknowns and derive the transfer function\n\nI believe there is an error in how I am setting up the equation at node 1, and I can't see it! Please help! Link in the comments.",

If such is the case and you are presented with two graduates of different unis. One from the more prestigious one and the other from the less. Now say the one from the more generally accepted, prestigious one has a lower CGPA than the competitor from the less prestigious uni. Which one would you generally go for? Being a freshman EE student, this was really hard for me to decide so I am here asking you. Please feel free to add anything relevant. Thanks.",

I have been added to the interview panel by my boss to interview someone for a very senior position (15+ years experience). I'm sure they have more domain specific knowledge than I do, going by their resume. How do you guys approach such interviews and/or what sort of questions do you ask in 45 minutes slot?  All others on the panel have equivalent years of experience, so I'm the outlier. Thanks!\n\nEdit: Thanks for the answers! I do have a regular 1-on-1 with the boss where I'd know more what's expected of me. I wanted to bring this up with you guys to hear your opinion. Couple of years back when I was put in a similar situation, where the person I had to interview had a PhD and a dozen patents in the domain - I went with them having to ask me questions for about 1/2 hour and the rest me asking them to explain the basic working of their past project in very simple terms. It's nice to hear more inputs from you all!",
