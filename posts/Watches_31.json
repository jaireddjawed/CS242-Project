However I noticed that once I leave court I feel that I'm generally in a bad neighborhood, and feel unsafe about wearing my watches. Since the courthouse is in the city with limited parking, I just take the public transit.\n\nI enjoy wearing watches and collect a variety of them, one of which is the Casio AE1200WHD, google it it's cool. I replaced the metal strap with a leather one and it looks professional enough to wear with a suit.\n\nBut since I have been wearing top tier watches such as Rolex and JLC, would others who have observed my nice watches think it is insulting that I start wearing a Casio?\n\nThoughts?

Unfortunately, the minute hand is often misaligned to my eye, which is exacerbated by the fact that it just sits there looking off for a whole minute at a time. It is an odd situation though, because the minute hand is not consistently misaligned. It will look correct on one minute, off on the next, and then back in alignment for the minute following that. Have a look:\n\n[Misaligned at the 59 minute mark](https://i.imgur.com/y8OKYwi.jpg)\nbut [dead-on at the top of the hour](https://i.imgur.com/BVupRBM.jpg)\n\nI'm seeking advice as to whether or not this is normal. If so, it's a shame. Radio controlled watches that cost a fraction of the price of this one do better with hand alignment.",

        "text": "Current Collection: Casio Duro &amp; Tissot Powermatic 80 Open Heart\n\nI'm looking to add one of the following timepieces to commemorate a promotion at work as well as my 29th birthday:\n\n\\-Tudor Black Bay Pro: \"Affordable\" (at least compared to the other options), simple, elegant, &amp; I'm a sucker for the stainless steel bezel. I like that it isn't very flashy either. On the thicker side but most of the reviewers say it isn't a deal breaker.\n\n\\-Omega Speedmaster Sapphire Sandwich: A busier but classic design with rich history, a lovely bracelet, a slim profile, and can be dressed up/down. As a space nerd, it would be cool to own a piece of mankind's greatest accomplishment (or at least one of them).  \n\n\\-Breitling Navitmer: Even busier design but I love the sunburst dial on these new Navis. The movement and claps are also beautifully finished.  It's interesting, unique, and a real head turner. Plenty of history as well being the first watch to go to space and it's role in aviation. My dad always took me to air shows growing up so I have a soft spot for the Navi's significance in the aviation field. \n\nThere is a big price difference between these 3 options with the Tudor being in my ideal budget of $4-5k. But the Omega/Breitling can be had on the grey market for $5700/$6700 respectively. I can stretch the budget for the Omega/Breitling but not sure if I should. I guess I'll have to check them out in person and let the heart decide...  \n\n\nWhat would be your pick?",

We negotiated on price and upon agreement, he paid for it.\n\nThere is absolutely ZERO seller protection on Chrono24. I can't even believe people are selling $50k+ watches on there if its this easy to get scammed.",

        "text": "For my 18th birthday, I want a higher quality watch which should last a few decades . I like field watches because I'm not anywhere near a sea, so I dont need much water resistance, the durability is good because I like going in the outdoors and generally like not worrying about wearing a watch while doing everyday tasks. A few weeks ago I took a look at japanese watches around 500 euros and the tortoise felt like a solid choice, but a few days ago I found a few videos about Hamilton. The size should be a point for the khaki because l have smaller wrists, although the tortoise should be fine. Also the first swiss made watch for my 18th birthday sounds like a pretty good start. So far I have 2 g shocks and a timex 1979 reissue, and I'm looking into buying a marathon gpm so the khaki/tortoise is gonna be the 5th (and hopefully one of the last watches Im gonna get). How does the quality compare? Manual or automatic? Overall seiko seems to get a bit of a worse rep than hamilton, but is this warranted or just the internet being the internet?",
