        "text": "Hello Folks, \n\nI've stumbled by accident upon the music video from The Shoes's Time to Dance, and I thoroughly enjoyed the wonderfully shot video, the storytelling, the atmosphere, and Jake Gyllenhaal's acting. Definitely a visual and auditory experience that I will remember.\n\nThis made me realize that since I started to use Spotify, I stopped paying attention to music videos, and I'm quite saddened by the fact, because when they're done right, they can enrich the song in a really perfect manner. I'm curious to hear if you would have any other recommendations for music videos that are works of art in their own ways, unique and that left a deep impression on you.",

Its from the past, maybe in the last 60 years or so, and it has a film clip with people in it doing all kinds of everyday things whilst looking disheartened and bleak about the state of the world. \n\nIts a folk rock style genre with drums that do a cool break before the chorus comes in, and a guy shouts \"Hey Yo Woah Man!\" in the pause before everything kicks back in. \n\nThe main hook is sung by a guy in falsetto and is something along the lines of \n\n\"Everyday I see someone new just trying to find a song they can't describe to people theyve never met in a music forum on the internet. Sometimes I wonder if it's all really just the same person just looking for attention. We all need some attention hey yo woah\"\n\nThanks!",
