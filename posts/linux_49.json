        "text": "Not that asking for help is inherently bad, it's just that I appreciate my self growth! And I just want to share what went was going wrong, and how I figured it out and fixed it!\n\nSo, this technically has been an ongoing issue for a while. I had packages that quite simply, would not upgrade, and I had no idea why. It wasn't hurting anything at the time, so I left it alone for a while. But this problem finally came around to bite me. I was trying to upgrade from Ubuntu 20.04 to 22.04, and the upgrade command was telling me to update all my packages to the latest... including the ones that would not update. Uh oh.\n\nSo, I did some investigation; I looked up the packages that were refusing to update, and tried to explicitly upgrade them individually, but they gave me an error that I did not understand at the time. (I won't be able to perfectly describe the error, as I did not copy it at the time, but I will describe the steps I took to figure it out).\n\nThe problem was with Intel graphics drivers, it was actually a couple of related packages (and I will not get the names perfect) something called `libdrm2` and `libdrm2:i386`. Spoiler alert: \n\n&gt;!This was the problem, though I didn't understand it yet. !&lt;\n\nMy first hint, was actually something seemingly unrelated. I had added an apt repository for Mono, because I wanted to do some game development and Godot used Mono. It (apt) was warning/complaining about i386 compatibility for that repository, and it was annoying me, so I looked up what it meant, and found out that I needed to add something like `[arc=amd64]` in front of the repository URL to make the warning go away. I did that, and the warning went away, yay! This did not solve my overall problem, however.\n\nSo, going back to the original problem, I was thinking: Huh, maybe it's a problem with the remote repository! I'll double check the references and see if they need updating! So I searched for how and where package repositories were saved and configured, and found what looked like a more reliable repository. Neat! So I tried looking for where the repository was configured so I could update it. But it was strange because... I was having trouble finding where that setting was! I ended up going to the /etc/apt folder and used grep to look up the Intel repository. And here's where it gets a little weird. Those files definitely contained those lines, but when I opened them with gedit... They weren't there? What makes it even weirder, is that I did `CTRL-F` to find the line, but the find didn't highlight anything. What was even WEIRDER was that the find section says it found 1 of 2, but it had an x next to it, but when I clicked what was essential the \"find next\" button, it brought me to the end of the document, nothing was highlighted, and the Intel repository that grep found *wasn't there*. I never found out what that was about, so I can only conclude my gedit was haunted.\n\nI did find a workaround to my problem, however. I went to the software &amp; updates graphical tool on Ubuntu, and unselected the ~~haunted~~ repository. Then, I followed Intel's guide online to add the repository back in a different (read: better and more secure) way.\n\nIn the course of doing this, I noticed that all repositories that were being used had the `[arc=amd64]` that I had to add to mono when it was complaining about i386. Hmmm, why is that familiar...\n\nAnyways, I decided to pay a bit more attention to the error messages this time. I saw the broken packages had two main sections (And I don't remember the section names now, I should have written this down; I will give a close approximation to what it was called): breaking and dependent.\n\nWhat was confusing to me was that libdrm2:i386 and libdrm2 were listing each other. The two packages were breaking one another? How were they installed then? I was confused, and decided to look up what it meant on google. It boiled down to the fact that one package was causing the other to break, so one of them had to be removed. This is where I got a little nervous, I had no idea which one was the right one to remove. (I should have probably asked a forum at this point, but I was both lazy and stupid; I really should have asked in retrospect) But... I was able to make a very educated guess. Earlier I said I had to fix a repository that was complaining about i386 and had to add `[arc=amd64]` to it. I know that my OS is 64 bit. Is i386 the 32 bit package? How did I get that? Huh. So I took an educated guess and `sudo apt remove libdrm2:i386`. Now, there were a lot of packages that were also related to this one (all i386, mind you), and I knew these were likely my display drivers, so if I broke this, then I knew I would be in a lot of trouble (hence my earlier retrospective on doing this without knowing was a bad idea). But I was probably really angry and impatient at the time, so I just said `y` and waited. It removed them all, and there were no issues. I could `sudo apt upgrade` the rest of the packages, and then finally, I was able to update from 20.04 to 22.04. Yay!\n\nWell, technically, it's still updating at the moment, so we'll see if my laptop catches fire because of my incompetence or not later, I guess. Anyways, I just wanted to share my success story! I don't think I can call myself a Linux noob anymore. And I'm very happy about it.",

        "text": "This weekend I have been a bit nostalgic for old Linux distributions. My earliest exposure to Linux was in 2003 when the MIS manager at a company I was interning at gave me 3 CDs with Redhat Linux 7.2. I never installed it until about 2004 when my dad got a way more powerful computer (Dell Dimension 8300) and ended up getting it to successfully install in VirtualPC. I should mention I did attempt to install it on my home PC at the time, a Zenith GT Workstation my mom got for me through a church donation. Either the computer was too old or I was clueless how to get it to work. I do remember the anaconda installer defaulting to a text based setup because the PC was not powerful enough to run the GUI. I think at that point I gave up.\n\nThe same network manager gave me a CD with an early version of Knoppix which was the first time I ever used Linux. This weekend though I was kinda reminded of the hardware compatibility issues Linux was notorious for back in the early 2000’s. That same company I interned at in the summer of ‘03, the Network Manager had the same Redhat Linux distro installed on one of the spare PC’s in his office. \n\nI will always remember it because it looks like he had a messed up X configuration with only half of his screen showing. The MIS manager had asked why doesn’t he fix that but he was kinda dismissive about it. But that in itself was likely a sign of how complex it was just to get running right on real hardware. \n\nWhich brings me to my issue. I downloaded two versions of Redhat Linux, 6.0 and 7.2 and tried installing both unsuccessfully in both Virtualbox 7.0 and VMWare Player 17, latest versions. The part where things always seem to go wrong is configuring X. There doesn’t seem to be a supported monitor type and video card for what I call for the period ‘modern Linux’ (kernel 2.4). What’s even stranger, I tried VMWare Workstation 3.2 on Windows 2000 and pretty much faced the same problems as modern hyper visors.\n\nIn some instances I got as far as a working installed with 300 x 280. But it’s unusable.\n\nAre there any recommendations, tips, tricks, workarounds for installing an older distro in a VM? It’s kinda strange considering how easy it is to get say Windows NT 3.1 (1993) up and running in Virtualbox, versus, a relatively 21st century distro such as Redhat Linux 7.2 (2001). \n\nIt’s striking comparison with todays Fedora or Ubuntu which are in some cases easier to setup in virtualization or physical hardware versus Windows 11.",

They seemed to have stemmed from Windows(?). \n\nSo,..(please confirm if this is indeed the case), `\\`clone\\`` system call is essentially the way for a process to spawn a thread (unlike `\\`fork\\`` for spawning a process).. and `\\`clone`\\` accepts parameters w.r.t what exactly it needs to share from the parent, virtual address space being the bare minimum. **Turns out, the so-called \"thread\" is indeed a process in Linux**. Inspection of \\`htop\\`, shows that even threads have PIDs. **So everything is ultimately a process?** \n\nInspection of \\`htop\\`, shows that even threads have PIDs ! So are everything processes?\n\nI understand somewhere down the line(2003), Linux was finally pThreads compliant. Is this the reason why it just exposes systemcalls like `\\`gettid()\\`` ? From an abstract OS model (not biased by linux), processes are just a way to group threads..and its ultimately the threads that are the smallest units of execution that can be scheduled on the core. This is why every process has atleast one thread(main thread). Since linux has it the other way around (processes are the smallest units of execution), did it do a lot of confusing stuff just to be posix compliant? eg. `ls /proc/&lt;PID&gt;/task` actually shows me all the threads belonging to the process with given PID. The ones that have just one thread(main thread), seem to have a single folder under \\`task\\` , with PID exactly equal to the PID of the parent. Basically the main thread has the same PID as the process it is contained in.\n\nDoes all of this mean that there is just an illusion of a thread in linux, while infact, theyre all processes?",

To avoid this you'll need to mount your ESP read-write and reinstall the bootloader after making that change. **Note: `update-grub` doesn't do this for you.**\n\nI can appreciate why the Grub devs did it this way, but that behaviour was completely opposite to my expectations, considering that most distributions mount the ESP read-only by default, if at all.

To avoid this you'll need to mount your ESP read-write and reinstall the bootloader after making that change.\n\nI can appreciate why the Grub devs did it this way, but that behaviour was completely different than my expectations, considering that most distributions mount the ESP read-only by default, if at all.

        "text": "...and I switched them both over to Linux (different flavors of Ubuntu). \n\nWhen I went to visit them, I was tired of spending hours in front of their computers doing updates and regular maintenance and malware busting just to keep the machines semi-workable. As soon as I switched them over to Linux, the amount of time I spent providing them tech support during visits plummeted. \n\nMy parents are not computer literate. That translated into lots of regular issues with their Windows computers. When we made the switch to Linux, I had to show them where to click or how to navigate the GUI in a couple of cases or do some basic setup work, and field the occasional question. But they were able to maintain the updates and upgrades process themselves, and the computers didn't need any other software-related maintenance other than the occasional reboot. And that's with me approaching them about any computer issues they've been having. Whereas with Windows, it was always them calling me up about the latest issue they'd been having.\n\nNow, we are finally replacing my mom's 12+ year old Core2Duo Dell laptop because it can't even run Lubuntu all that well anymore. While we could upgrade the ram (it only has 3gb) and HDD, that type of ram is actually pretty scarce now, not all that inexpensive, the laptop is fairly banged up, and I think over 12 years is a pretty dang good run for a laptop anyway. I'm thinking of going Lenovo this time, either a Thinkpad E15 or a Thinkbook 15 (both intel, because they seem to be fully certified to work out of the box with Linux).\n\nJust thought I'd share the positive story. Here's another one that had a bit wider reach: Around the same time, I also ran a public technology education program for older adults, and we switched to Lubuntu in the computer lab for similar reasons. The people using the program barely noticed. They said \"windows looks funny\" but a lot of them appreciated the fact that I had \"upgraded the computers\" (they were a lot faster and more responsive)! In fact, it was the Windows techies that complained the most, I think because it was something outside their narrow comfort zone. But the more ignorant people didn't care one bit in the worst cases, and responded positively to the change (more functional, reliable, responsive computers!) otherwise. I don't think the Tech Support guys for the computer lab liked it, though. They only knew Windows, and they charged $70/hr for tech support which was a huge financial drain to the program. Those expenses for us (and revenue for them) all-but went away after the change.",

        "text": "Some time ago I wanted to give the [aerc](https://aerc-mail.org/) email client a try, but then I deleted it when I found out that it stores the password in plain text. But now I wonder, how do other applications store sensitive information like passwords? For example in [KMail](https://apps.kde.org/kmail2/) I only entered my password initially and the application stored it somewhere.\n\nThe obvious solution is to store data encrypted, but how does the application decrypt it again? It would need some cryptographic key, but then we have just kicked the can down the road: the key itself needs to be either plain text or it needs to be encrypted again, which necessitates another key or a password.\n\nIn [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/bwao4d/comment/epwikl7/) comment the author of aerc says that the config file must have permissions `600` (read+write for owner, nothing for rest of system), so it is not readable by the rest of the system. Is this what other applications do as well? A malicious application I have installed which has access to the file system could just read my settings and an attacker who gets physical access to my machine (e.g. a thief) could just hook up the hard drive to his computer and bypass and OS permissions. For the latter I would have to encrypt my hard drive, and for the former I guess I have to be careful what I run and not just trust \"lol, the password is encrypted\". Am I correct?",
