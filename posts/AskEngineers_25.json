        "text": "I’m sure this gets asked all the time.  But I’m having a hard time deciding what I’d like to do, as my interest and hobbies touch different fields of engineering.\n\nMy main path would be mechanical engineering.  As I wanted to become one since high school.  But as I’m 15 years out of highschool, my interest have changed.  But I’ve also been a mechanic for the last 12 years.  So I have experience, but not sure if that would actually help me professionally.  The big issue is that to complete this degree, I’d have to travel an hour away for classes during my last two years.  While working full time or close to full time.  \n\nSo I’ve been looking at engineering degrees in the sister college in my town.  And a couple really interest me.  They would be Computer Engineering, Environmental Engineering, and potentially Electrical engineering.\n\nIssue is deciding on one.  I in general love tinkering. I’ve always loved computers, and have always though it would be fun to learn more about them. Same thing with electrical engineering, I love building electronics, but I’m not the best at it, as I haven’t had time to learn as much about as I’d like.  But I do build simple devices on occasion.\n\nOne that has really caught my eye is the environmental engineering.  As I love environmental stuff.  I even have 350g of saltwater aquariums in my basement, and have been breeding paligic spawners.  I’ve always had an interest in biology. \n\nNot going to lie, I’ve always thought it would cool to get into underwater drones and stuff like that use for discovery and research.  Which I’m guessing is more mechanical/electrical/robotics engineering.\n\nSo how did you decide?  And to be honest, a good work life balance is important to me. As I’ve been working 6 days a week for the last 12 years.  I’d just like to finally have a decent income so I can afford to enjoy hobbies and free time more.",

I believe this will give the locomotive more HP over the course of running and can enable better torque at slow speeds.\n\nThe 3 cylinders would be in line underneath the smoke box. The 3rd cylinder (compound cylinder) would drive the 2nd axle on a 4 axle drivered locomotive, with the 2 outer cylinders driving the 4th axle.\n\nThere were plenty of 4 cylinder locomotives not dissimilar to this.

I recently installed VFD to control speed and lessen energy consumption.\n\nAm i getting this right? Please correct me if i’m wrong. \n\nLower frequency = lower speed = lower voltage, but due to constant torque, lower speed = higher torque in which = higher current.\n\nDoes this mean that even if i lower the frequency, hence lower voltage, the energy consumption will still remain high as current increases with higher torque at lower speed?\n\nPower = voltage x amp\n\nIn which of these scenario am i able to decrease energy consumption? If i keep the frequency at 60 hz, voltage remains at 220v. Amp is around 3.5. This equates to 770w.\n\nIf i change to 30 hz frequency, voltage is around 140v but amp slightly decreases at 3.3. Is there a way to decrease current/torque at lower speed?\n\nIs there a possible to get an energy cosumption of 200-300w with a 1.5 hp induction motor using a VFD? \n\nThank you",

But after getting a quote for beams that I actually considered very reasonable, I’m thinking now that maybe I could serve the same purpose for much less money.\n\nMy question: is anyone here familiar with any type or sort of engineer that can help me generally build a bridge without a site visit or thousands in engineering costs? I know this isn’t the type of thing to cheap out on, but ideally, I’d like to present a simple bridge plan to someone that can say “You’ll be more than fine with that” or give me a hard no, all without accepting any legal liability for my project, and then go from there.\n\nI studied engineering for while in school before switching majors, so I’m not completely unaware of the plethora of factors at play here, but I guess my main curiosity is if common sense can go hand in hand with safety in a situation like this.",

The image below explains the process we use for profiling the rolls. Over time, the rolls lose the slightest amount of material and the profile is lost. To get it back, we have a set of two blocks (in red) that travel along the length of both rolls. This is done to get the correct pressure required. The problem is that if you follow the crowned path, the flat roll becomes crowned, and visa-versa. This process needs to be done in place, the rolls cannot feasibly be taken out to be serviced.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/8JNvGpV.png](https://i.imgur.com/8JNvGpV.png)\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1.

        "text": "Hi. I am working on a DFMEA for a large differential-type system. I am taking a bottom-up approach, starting with individual components DFMEAs and working my way up to the next subsystem and so forth. But on the component level, I have some concerns about the correct identification of \"functions\" that I'd like some insight on.\n\nSee schematic here: [https://ibb.co/cTFz6yb](https://ibb.co/cTFz6yb)\n\nSee simple boundary diagram here: [https://ibb.co/BVpsXNm](https://ibb.co/BVpsXNm)\n\n**Quick explanation:** The red clutch drum is the input. It spins and is splined onto the pinion shaft. The pinion is held radially in place (and allowed to rotate) via two roller bearings (mounting in the pink housing). There are also two gray shims that are using for preload and spacing. The light gray nut provides the clamp load to put all the pieces together, so to speak. The output in a ring gear that mates with the pinion teeth. \n\nWhere I'm at now: Doing the pinion DFMEA. My first step is to list the functions of the item. So, functions of the pinion. What I have:\n\n1. Transmit torque quietly and efficiently from clutch drum to ring gear. \n\nAnd that's it!  This addresses the \"clutch drum\" and \"ring gear\" boxes that cross the boundary on the diagram. And the potential failure modes are: (1) Does not transmit torque; (2) does not transmit torque efficiently; and (3) does not transmit torque quietly, which the respective effects being a total loss of function, a partial or degraded loss of function, and NVH/customer dissatisfaction. \n\n**My Question:** As you can see from the schematic and boundary diagram, there are additional interfaces with the shims, roller bearings, and nut that are not addressed here, despite crossing the boundary. What functions, if any, would/should I add to the hypoid gear to make sure these boundary fluxes are covered?\n\nMy thought is something like: \"Interfaces properly with shim,\" and \"Interfaces properly with roller bearing,\" etc., with the downstream causes being things like \"pinion shaft OD too large/small\" etc. But is that correct? Should you add an individual \"function\" for every single component about how it should \"interface correctly\" with adjacent/touching components? Just seems weird to think that a \"function\" of the pinion is for it to interface properly with a bearing. In my head, it's not: the pinion is for transmitting torque. But how, then, are these additional interfaces accounted for in the DFMEA?\n\nThank you",

This test has many nuances to it as we are limited to the methods by which we can test certain components without damaging or opening product. I've tried dozens of methods and have proposed two which I'm decently confident in, but they will need to be validated at an extremely rigorous level so I have my concerns. There is potentially millions of dollars at stake. My director has me supplying data for a presentation to the executives of the corporation tomorrow on the project status.\n\nShould I be concerned if my project fails? It seems kind of weird to me to have a new engineer (not a Sr.) tasked to this \"#1 priority\" project. Will my superiors understand the many nuances of this project and understand the difficulty associated with it? Am I at risk of losing my job??",

        "text": "This isn't a competition or homework, just personal curiousity. Suppose you needed to make an engine with 10kW of continuous output for humanitarian, military or government applications (running remote generators and fluid pumps for instance). The aim is the design with the lightest weight, smallest volume and quietest noise signature. Assume cost is only a secondary concern. \n\nWhich of the following design choices would you make and why?\n\n1. Single cylinder or two-cylinder horizontally-opposed (boxer)? The 2-cyl almost doubles the moving parts and makes packaging more complicated... but saves a lot of weight compared to the heavy crankshaft needed to balance a 1-cyl, because boxer engines have almost perfect primary and secondary balance and double the power strokes for a given number of revolutions (assuming alternating firing order).\n\n2. Turbocharged or naturally aspirated? A turbo adds a little weight and much plumbing, but would half the required displacement, and can be equipped with an oversize turbine to drive a small generator to generate additional power from the exhaust stream (turbocompounding)\n\n3. Air-cooled or water-cooled? Water cooling adds complexity but makes the engine much quieter, and the stable temperatures allow tighter tolerances a d more horsepower for a given disacement\n\n4. Gasoline or Diesel? Diesel is denser (less fuel weight) and eliminates the ignition system, but needs stronger high-compression components and more displacement for the same power\n\n5. Pushrods or overhead camshafts? Pushrods are elegant and simple (no belt or chain drive), especially with a boxer configuration (only one camshaft), but overhead cams allow higher revs, which would potentially reduce displacement requirements and consequent weight.",

        "text": "I am trying to find some way to protect a humidity sensor(SHT35) from damage due to being submerged in grain for extended periods of time. These sensors will be exposed to dust and physical damage from the grain itself. I was thinking that some sort of sintered metal filter might be a good solution as it should be strong enough to prevent damage and could filter out the dust while still allowing diffusion to occur. I figure that I would probably need some sort of flat filter about 5mm wide and 10mm tall.\n\nI am not an engineer and I have absolutely zero experience with using sintered metal filters. I would appreciate any input on if this would work or any recommendations on what I should be looking for. Thanks.",
