I find that very shocking being used to the politics of today. That vote actually cost at least one Democratic Senator his job; Alan Dixon of Illinois lost his primary challenge to Carol Moseley Braun who ran against him specifically because of his vote in favor of Thomas later that year. \n\nI just don't understand why they didn't believe Anita Hill's story, and why would Democrats vote to confirm such a far-right justice?",
