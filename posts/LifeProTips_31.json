        "text": "If you meet someone and they only have negative things to say about their exes that's a huge red flag no matter how well things are going between the two of you. Initially it might seem innocuous but they chose to date those exes for good reasons and had good times with them and later choose to only see the negative. It's a very strong hint your relationship will follow the same path. \n\nDoubly so if they put you on a pedestal or are unreasonably positive about you. It can start off fun or cute. But it's probably a person with a pattern of meeting someone new, idealizing them and falling out.",

        "text": "\nAfter working at a car rental company, i cant tell you how many times we ran out of cars. Firstly, its not the representative’s fault; dont yell at them. \n\nSecondly, reserving a car, frustratingly, doesnt always guarantee you a car. In most cases, reservations are always based on returns for the day. So if a company doesnt have enough returns to meet the demands of the rentals, that company has a wait list for vehicles that can be multi-hour. Think tables at a restaurant. If you reserve a table at a restaurant for 1pm, but when you arrive, the tables are still full from previous reservations, you have to wait for one to be cleared and cleaned. Same with car rentals.\n\nThings happen and rental companies can be on multi-hour waits or completely out of vehicles for the day due to overbooking from third-party websites like Expedia or Hotwire. These third-parties do not have access to a location’s inventory. This means that they can book a car that will never be there, and they will have no way or reason to tell you, because all they want is your money. Booking through the company’s website has more accurate inventories and an more streamlined customer service, even though its still not great. Even though its more pricey than the third parties, its more reliable. \n\nFurthermore, most car rental companies have free loyalty programs, like Hertz GOLD and Enterprise Emerald Club. If you book with a loyalty number, 9/10 times if there’s a wait for vehicles, you’re boosted drastically upwards on the wait list. Plus you get points and rewards toward future rentals.\n\nDoing all this can help alleviate some stress if a car rental doesnt have a vehicle for you. If one company falls through, you have a backup. Instead of pre-paying and losing out on a lot of money and being denied a refund, the $20 cancellation fee of another company is better since you didnt pre-pay for the vehicle you never got.\n\nTL;DR- Booking under a loyalty program with two companies directly through their website will increase your chance of not getting the car you reserved.",

I find that 90% of the time you match with somebody when online dating, the other party (in my specific case, women) don't tend to actually try and push the conversation along. Great example is that they will answer questions extended to them, but never ask a question back. To be frank, it makes most online matches start to feel like a job interview with me as the interviewer.\n\nNow, I'm pretty certain I know why this is. As much as it hurts to say, Im not swimming in matches. I never get more than one at once, so I put more stock into it. Realistically, they are probably talking to multiple people and I'm just another one of them... Because they have more options, they are going to have less investment in the conversation. I totally get that.\n\nSo, that means I have to keep her attention for long enough to stand out from the others. But I find I'm struggling to do that. I can handle like, a day... Maybe two at most before I just stop responding because I'm just not feeling like she actually gives a shit. I feel like I need to learn to survive a bit longer without giving up.\n\nAny advice?",

        "text": "So a bit of a back story, two weeks ago I took a long overdue mental health leave from work. I've been dealing with depression and anxiety for years now and attend therapy sessions on a weekly basis.\n\nOver the last year my work environment has grown increasingly harder to deal with, from my possessions being stolen to unfair treatment (I'm from eastern Europe and pretty much all of my colleagues are Dutch or at least born here) and even \"bullying\" if I can call it that (a coworker saying that no one likes me on a few occasions, he blames me for issues I had nothing to do with, I have asthma and we have these giant ventilation fans that make the air extremely dry and everyone knows this bothers me but every time I turn them off in my work area, someone turns them back on when I'm not around...). If you think this is starting to sound like some high school level pettiness, it's because it is high school level pettiness.\n\nAll of these issues were always brought up to my manager. He resigned a month ago and called in sick for the remainder of his working days. The communication between him and my two bosses was almost nonexistent but at the same time my bosses spend all of their time hiding in their offices and don't seem like they give any thought about what's happening on the production floor. \n\nNow coming to present day, yesterday my boss invited me for a meeting to talk about my situation and my future with the company. I'm sure my contract won't be extended (they rarely give out permanent contracts) and I also have no wish of staying. On a side note, by law any contract conversations should happen a month in advance and my current contract expires in a few days, so that says a lot about how on top of things my bosses are. \n\nSo my question is, when I go to this talk tomorrow should I lay it all out on the table and tell my boss about all the things that made me resent my job in the last year and that contributed to the state of my mental health or should I just say \"thank you for the opportunity, sorry it didn't work out\" and that's it. My dad advised me to do the first, while my sister said the opposite, so now I'm torn and very anxious as it is.",

Right now I’m making a list of things that I would like to improve but because of my ADHD I often write down tasks that are way too big. So I’m trying to make the list a bit more accessible for myself. Instead of writing down one big task, I wrote down multiple smaller ones. For example instead of ‘I want to improve my looks’ I write down ‘go to the hairdresser’ and ‘finding a pair of jeans I really like’. I want to do this for many aspects of my life. So not only physical appearance but also creating good habits, things for school, cleaning and tidying my house and other things that will improve my life and how I feel about myself and my life.\n\nSo my question is, do any of you have similar lists? And if not do you have something that I can add onto mine?\n\nIt would help me a lot 😊",

After the quake is finished, take only the survival kit and your documents and go outside and wait until you know the building is still safe to live in.\n\nTLDR: Keep water and dry food rich in calories nearby. During the earthquake don't run down stairs or worse elevator. \n\nFind today the load-bearing walls in your home. \nIf if there are bad shakes sit under a table in a corner where at least 2 walls are load bearing.",

        "text": "As someone who has struggled with picky eaters, had siblings who have struggled with picky eaters, what I’ve personally observed is the best possible approach is what I call a “zero emotion policy”. There is no negative feedback for not eating something, no positive feedback for eating anything either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMeals should consist of 85% of what you know they like to eat, 15% of what you know they aren’t super keen on (but not something way outside their current palette). At home, the only available food is 3 square meals a day. There are no snacks, and no deserts outside of special occasions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nZERO EMOTION. They can eat all of it, they can it none of it. They can kick and scream. Walk away. They’ll get hungry, they’ll eventually put the food in their face, and when they do, there is no reaction to this either. Eating food is not a game, it’s not a contest, it’s a process of nourishing oneself which needs zero fanfare. Once your kid gets that there is no emotional valance, they will understand there is no leverage here - it’s just them and their food, and their decision of whether they want to eat it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBig disclaimer is of course things like sensory issues, or other emotional/psychological issues. If you feel your kid is really outside the norm, talk to your doctor.",

When I am out sick, or on vacation, my coworkers miss me. They just might be missing the coffee guy, but I don’t mind. Coworkers look forwards to when I make coffee, and it’s a win win, because I too enjoy the coffee. TLDR, be the coffee guy, and people will like you more, merely due to association to the ‘drug.’",
