Here Battaglia highlights the tension between essentialism and the self as sum total of contingency (historical, cultural, political - power differential - and thus amorphous and malleable).  \n\nBut as a former psych major, I recall twin studies, which have anchored the traditional Manichean-esque nature/nurture polemic into a happy medium of both/and.  And I can't help but think the essentialism/contingency debate is simply the nature/nurture debate 2.0.  \n\nBattaglia goes as far to say that \"to represent agency as individually or constantly situated would be a breach of ethics\" and that the self is nothing more than \"a representational economy; a reification continually defeated by mutable entanglements with other subjects' histories, experiences, self-representations.\"I suspect this is to avoid steam rolling with observation subjectivity.\n\nIt seems to me that if the individual possesses constant psychic characteristics within the self, then the individual would also possess some constant identic characteristics within society.  So my question is where can I find this conversation 20-ish years later?  If you could reproduce any of the arguments here, I would be very grateful, as well.  Also, are there any good identical twin studies where each twin was separated across culture?  I'd love to read up on those, too.  \n\nThanks for your time, and thanks for the chance to throw down the thoughts spinning in my head.",

Would he no longer be 'free' or 'fyrd' because he refused to be in the fyrd?  Did that mean he became a slave?  Was he then gifted to vassals/big-men to bolster approval of the king or chief?\n\nIf this was true, what was the context of this (hypothetical) slavery institution when south britain (what would later become england, politically speaking) became christian?  Didn't christians outlaw slavery, or was that different in the early middle ages?\n\nAnd then it gets me thinking about the inherent idea that springs from this of 'free men are those that serve, or that are willing to fight' relates to germanic pagan culture/warrior society, and the religion the anglo saxons had before the first king among them became christian.  What do we understand about germanic pagan culture?  Are those that worship pagan gods also the ones that are willing to fight?  If they're willing to fight (ideally in service to a chieftain or king), then perhaps the cultural reasoning is that they are bestowed with deific blessing and it is thus 'immoral' to enslave them?  It makes me think how far this social institution could have gone back in time.  \n\nI recall reading in 'Sapiens' about how early neolithic cultures had a lot of violence prior to the appearance of centralized city states - probably (I conjecture) what was endemic warfare.  An anarchistic order of 'might makes right'.  Is it possible that 'only those who fight are free' in a society of decentralized law and order, sprang from that sort of existence? \n\nOr am I conjecturing far too much, and we don't actually know anything about germanic pagan culture whatsoever (or enough to say anything about what hollywood and obsession over vikings has made us think regarding it)?\n\n-------\n\nSorry if this is much more complicated than the title suggests, but it all strongly relates in my mind.

But to my great confusion, while women control most affairs, own all the property, and vote for their leaders, their leaders are always...men. Another time in anthropology class, we read about a few societies (\"gifting\" societies as opposed to \"governing\") where all the \"leader\" really did was be the village representative at the \"potlatch\" (American Northwest) or \"maka\" (Papua New Guinea). He did make any rules or carry out punishment/judgement, but he was still the representative.\n\n\nWhy is this? Why is it that even in societies where women \"dominate,\" men have the formal leadership?

        "text": "I'm talking about human societies that feature regular consumption of deceased human flesh. This is highly taboo in some cultures but apparently normal in other cultures.\n\nIn Papua New Guinea in the 1950s and 60s, the Fore people became infected with a disease called kuru after eating human brains. I just have a hard time understanding this. This is a rather primitive tribe that probably had no refrigeration, and any animal quickly decomposes after death. Therefore, a deceased human would only be \"good\" for at most a meal or two.\n\nMore importantly, that one meal hardly provides any meat or nutritional value. It may theoretically fill up your stomach and give you some caloric intake, but what happens after that? A 20-year-old person who is 150 pounds at death might provide some meat for others, but that's nothing compared to the food that person had to consume to get there. They had to waste so many calories to provide so little meat.\n\nAnd then there's the most obvious: the cannibals could just eat whatever the humans eat to grow in the first place. That would probably provide much more nutritional value since, unlike domesticated animals, humans don't exactly give you more output the more you feed them.\n\nAll this suggests that cannibalism is biologically counterintuitive and makes no sense. How could any society make regular use of it and subsist for more than a few years? Wouldn't it be obvious pretty quickly that eating humans is useless unless there's nothing else around to eat?",

If the skeletal development is inconsistent with dental development then it could mean that an individual did not behave, think, or socially interact with their conspecifics in the way that we expect they would have. This obviously calls into question if assigning an age group (e.g. juvenile, adolescent, adult, old adult) to extinct hominins solely based on their teeth (e.g. most specimens from Sima de los Huesos and Zhoukoudian) is appropriate.\n\nSo apart from Nariokotome boy, does anyone know of any research that looked into determining age from both dental and skeletal development?",

This is the methodological principle that, whatever the analyst's own religious convictions, or lack of them, theistic and mystical beliefs are subject to sociological scrutiny on the assumption that they are not literally true.\n\nThe way I understood this excerpt, and the following paragraphs, is that an anthropological study of religion would have to abstain from judgement on the truth values of the religious beliefs being studied (maybe \"methodological agnosticism\" would be a better term, but that is unimportant here). So far so good, since it seems a very intellectually productive way of approaching religious practices and beliefs without being disrespectful or condescending.\n\nHowever, taking into account the recent(ish) call by the ontological turn to \"take others seriously\" - that is, to (if I understand the turn correctly, which I somewhat doubt I fully do) abstain from such a theoretical detachment in which the anthropologist, by \"withholding judgement\", is rather slipping back into a patronizing stance that portrays other peoples' beliefs as \"mere\" beliefs (in the same way, say, an adult might \"withhold judgement\" on whether or not Santa exists to amuse a child) -, is it possible for an anthropologist of religion to take their informants beliefs seriously - that is, not as \"mere belief\", but rather as ontological truth?  \nIn other other words, how, if at all, would an ontological anthropology of religion operate? Or, on a more practical way, anthropologists of religion, how did/do you manage the discrepancy (if you had/have!) between your own personal religious beliefs and the religious beliefs of your interlocutors?\n\nI know this is a tough question, and I do not expect easy answers - it is just something that has been going on the back of my mind for a couple days now and I would like other people's input :)",

As I've been exploring what anthropology is and does, I find I'm falling in love with it.  It checks power - governmental and economic - by humanizing it.  It amalgamates many disciplines - history, sociology, psychology, political science, economics - into a sort of multi-disciplinary watchdog.  Social justice, social harmony, and humanity resonate with me deeply, and seem to be at the heart of anthropology.\n\nBut this also troubles me.  These are not things that the Chinese government is kindly responsive to.  I would love to study anthropology, then hope to continue my teaching career over here in China.  I don't have any desire to \"make trouble\" as a dissident, I simply want to contribute to things over here.  So I guess I'm asking for all you Sino-anthropologists out there - or any of you other anthropologists with a fascination for currently authoritarian cultures - is this study path reconcilable with my dream to work and teach in China?",

Christianity has gnosticism, and Hinduism is ripe for this sort of talk considering the nature of brahman.  I guess what I'm wondering is if there are examples of this in other early pantheistic religions (i.e. the Egyptians, Babylonians, Celts, and Norse)  It seems that whenever an ecclesiastical government forms in written history that they arrive at similar debates. I would find out on my own but I'm having trouble phrasing the question in a concise enough way to find the results I'm looking for.

        "text": "I'm getting ready to take a two-semester language course to beef up my Chinese before applying to graduate school.  I've been doing some reading and have found many interests.  If you have the time, I'd like to paste them here and ask your opinion if this is possible to fit into a thesis of some sort or if I am just way off base or in the wrong field.  \n\nFirst, ever since my undergrate studies, I've been fascinated by this tension I see between what I call Spirit and Law.  I noticed it in Sufism within Islam, the Upanishads, and specifically Sri Aurobindo's work The Life Divine within Hinduism, among other places.  The reason I name it Spirit and Law is because I first noticed it in my recent examination of the first and second century church between the \"gnostics\" and the proto-orthodox movements.  Elaine Pagel's research highlighted for me polemic elements within the Gospel of John in response to the Gospel of Thomas, and it was here, in the tradition with which I am most familiar that I saw these trends.  Law attempts to define, delineate, dogmatize, and reify, while Spirit tends to emphasize experience.  For the proto-orthodox movement, the narrative was supreme, for the gnostics, the narrative was a delivery mechanism for the experience.  \n\nSo when I turned to my investigation towards China, I wanted to see if these tension existed here, as well, and I see it pertinently in the late 19th, early 20th century dialogue of latter-day Confucianists like Kang Youwei.  He took the Confucian notion of the Great Community, which Confucius mournfully hearkened back to as a bygone era and projected it forward teleologically.  He fell out of fashion in favor of Sun Yat-Sen's revolutionary inclinations, and when the  CCP took over, they paid lip-service to Kang Youwei as a reformer, but quickly put his ideas to the side because for various reason - some ad hominem such as his ties to Confucianism or his now regressive practice of having concubines, and some of them political reasons such as his support of the Qing dynasty.  \n\nBut that hasn't stopped the party from co-opting his ideas in a very general way.  I say co-opt, because many of my students have read in their textbooks that Deng Xiaoping was the first to promote the Xiao Kang as a political ideology.  But since his administration, the party has been promoting this, and even hinting at the distant, unrealized future prospect of ushering in the Great Community.  Now this is all done as propaganda in a rather insincere way, but it is something that is salient in the minds of most of my students.  \n\nI think this is anthropological because I'm not necessarily interested in Kang Youwei as an historical figure nor in his ideas in philosophical terms.  To follow the model you've provided, I am interested in the ideas Kang Youwei and his contemporaries as  a topic and how they apply to the modern political milieu and discourse.  \n\nI'm also interested in this from a psychological perspective.  In order to define how the Chinese organize themselves in society, Fei Xiaotong creates the term differential modes of association (差序格局), which he describes with the metaphor of a waves rippling out from an epicenter in water, where each wave represents a ring of associations.  With this he highlights the interconnectedness and interdependence of each relationship, and these relationships also form the boundaries of consciousness.  Even though \"the state\" has always comprised the outer most boundary in name, it has not necessarily functioned to bring about an awareness outside of the Xiao Kang, as Confucius described \"Every one loves (above all others) his own parents and cherishes (as) children (only) his own songs\".  With regards to the state \"Great men imagine it is the rule that their states should descend in their own families\".  So the relationship of Kang Youwei's Great Community as it applies to creating another ripple in the pond, expanding awareness to include all people, in a bottom up way irrespective of the functions of state is also something I am playing around with.\n\nUnfortunately, I feel I am still thinking like an undergrad student, and I have a difficult time fitting this into the model you've provided.  As of now, they feel like focused interest, not a PhD topic, but they do strike me as anthropological.  Or I am thinking in the wrong direction: is the philosophical, psychological or historical?  \n\nI think my better question is this: what sources would you turn me to to refine my ideas?\n\nThank you again for your time and I'd appreciate any feedback you might have to offer.\n",

The is the paper (pdf warning)\n\nhttp://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~henrich/Website/Papers/HenrichTasmania.pdf\n\nBut does anyone know if there's been research that aimed at estimating local population sizes and finding associations between it and the \"intensity\" or \"complexity\" of symbolic behaviour?\n\nWe have instances of human burials associated with aurohcs in the Neolithic, where the symbolic significance of these beasts has been observed from where modern Turkey is down to south Israel.\n\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/funerals-and-feasts-during-the-prepottery-neolithic-b-of-the-near-east/C535925F76EDDF6C38D0F920E9520557\n\nSo it's clear that there was a regional continuity of symbolic behaviour regarding the cultural significance of aurochs in the Neolithic, which might have been the result of high population density which necessitated homogenization of cultural/ritual practices to reduce the likelihood of inter-group conflicts.\n\nBut is it true? Do cultural practices become more homogenized in specific regions due to population growth/density? Do symbolic practices become more elaborate or intense due to the need to conspicuously distinguish \"us\" from \"others\"? Due to the need to develop as many practices as possible that lead people to experience intense emotions and result in greater social cohesion? ",

It seems like each society studied (Evans-Pritchards and the Azande, for example) only have one anthropologist who has done research. So, is there any society that believed in witchcraft and was studied by more than one anthropologist that has a journal/research done on said society? Thanks in advance!",

I'm usually chill about bugs, I don't love them, but the one that makes me freak out is a cockroach. So it got me thinking, why is that? I know some people don't hate them and even like them, and even I find some bugs incredibly beautiful, but generally people dislike them or always prefer to just not be near them. \n\nWhen did this start to happen? How has been humans relationship with bugs throughout time in general? \n\nThanks in advance for any reply! ",

(I have access to a major university library and online databases, just finding this info is proving painful).\n\nAlso, I understand that in the 1800’s Paleolithic archeology in France was influenced by paleontological discoveries, is there a good source(s) for this?\t\n",

Hence unexpected (but not dangerous) events, pattern breaks etc, elicit a pleasurable dopaminergic response, and laughter is a concomitant social signal that there is something to \"get\", and we \"get it\". I was wondering if this is well known or if there are other theories? ",
