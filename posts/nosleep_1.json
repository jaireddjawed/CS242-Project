        "text": "I've always had a love for insects. The love ants shared for each other, the biodiversity, the just plain weirdness. For some reason, though, I didn't like spiders. Sure, they were cute, but when I saw one in person, I'd start panicking. I never hurt it. I never liked to hurt insects, even the spiders.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnts were my particular favorites. They were all the same from afar, but up close, they couldn't be more different. They all had lives, but they all pitched in. Which is why I became a myrmecologist. Even then, I never felt fulfilled. Sure, I was researching ants, which I loved, but something just didn't really feel right in my soul. Like there was empty space.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually, I filled that void. I met someone else who liked ants,  and even wanted to start some colonies. We eventually got one, too! Her name was Millie.  I got some personal favorites, Asian Bullet Ants. We both liked them, but I had a particular fondness for them, since they were so small, yet could pack a punch and make a difference.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe had many ant colonies. Fire ants, carpenter ants, etc. But they would eventually die out. So we started a little experiment, to see if something could truly become immortal. Obviously, we wouldn't risk our ants just yet, so we bought an old tarantula. Tarantulas often died due to being stuck in their old molt, but we'd stop that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSure enough, it got stuck, but we got it out. It was marginally bigger. We sent it to a lab, for further testing. We even found a way to make our own queens without them leaving for nuptial flight, so colonies wouldn't die. We loved our ants the way you would love a child. It was nice. Their food could be found outside, and eventually the colonies grew to amazing sizes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were contacted by the lab 2 years after we sent the tarantula there. They said it had escaped. Me and Millie looked at each other. We hoped it hadn't grown too big to sustain its weight, than died. No creature deserves that. We decided to go bug-hunting to calm our nerves. We found a massive dead caterpillar, so we decided to feed that to our ants later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe couldn't buy normal ant food, like mealworms, since the pet store had collapsed. They don't know why. They assume it was because of an earthquake or something. As we walked back, I swore I heard something in the forest. Pitter-patters, but louder. Millie hadn't heard anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomething woke us in the dead of night. Something eating something else. Millie was fast asleep, so I grabbed a flashlight and started leaving. I heard horrifying noises. Howls, crunching, and that ever-present metal moving. I kept going, looking for the source of the noise. Nothing. Nada. I heard it around the corner. I took a peek, and what I saw surprised me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA raccoon. I was surprised it had the strength to knock over our garbage can, but it was gorging itself on banana peels and some other stuff I couldn't see. I went back into the house, and noticed the trash can from the window. The raccoon had vanished. I didn't really care, and went back to bed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMillie was still fast asleep, so I took the duty of taking care of the ants in the morning. I noticed the package of mealworms I ordered from Amazon had arrived, so I grabbed that. I fed the ants as per usual, and decided to put the box down near their cages.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was at work, when Millie suddenly called me.\n\n\"Hey, how are yo-\"  \n\"SOMEONE BROKE INTO OUR HOUSE.\"\n\n\"What?\"  \n\"THE GLASS IS SHATTERED. YOU KNOW THE PACKAGE OF THE MEALWORMS YOU GOT?\"\n\n\"Well, yes.\"  \n\"IT WAS THE ONLY THING MISSING.\"\n\nI requested a break from work, and decided to head home, to check out the damage.\n\nSure enough, there was a smallish hole in our window. However, there was a rectangular hole beneath it, just barely touching. I sighed. Looks like it was back to feeding the ants meat and veggies.   \n\n\nI decided to take a walk, to calm my mind. I walked, taking in the serenity of nature. How the birds chirped, the grass growing, and I inhaled, feeling blessed to be in this great world. I was not expecting my nostrils to be violently assaulted. I looked down, and right in front of me, on the ground, was a dead raccoon. A massive hole in its stomach. If I'd eaten today, I would have vomited.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI returned home, tired. I needed to sleep. But I realized something. With me feeding all the groceries to the ants, we had none left. I noticed Millie sleeping soundly, and it didn't feel right for me to wake her up than sleep myself. So, heart heavy, I began the trip to the grocery store.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI picked up some meat, veggies, all the essentials. I also picked up some febreze, due to me being worried the dead-raccoon smell would waft over to my house. I drove home. I tapped on the wheel, listening to a true crime podcast. I liked them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI returned home to find it ransacked, and didn't hear Millie snoring. I ran over to our bedroom, and found her on the bed, eyes wide open. She seemed to be mouthing something. I interpreted it as \"Under the blanket, don't make noise\". I uncovered the blanket, and found something horrifying.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWebbing. Webbing everywhere. Millie was tied to the bed by webbing. It was too sticky to undo without being trapped there myself. I opened the emergency safe, and grabbed a shotgun. Something was up. I heard noise coming from the ant room. I opened the door, and was greeted by a monstrosity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA giant spider. A GIANT SPIDER. It was sniffing around for the food it smelled. It stomped the ground in frustration. I whimpered, which caused it to whip around. It sized me up, and lunged. I shot that thing in the chest. It blew back a bit, and got MAD. It started kicking hairs everywhere. Every table I kept my ants on fell. Some ants spilled out. Bullet ants, fire ants, they all seemed to make an agreement.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe spider looked at me with all 8 of its eyes, then suddenly recoiled. Ants swarmed the spider. They were everywhere. Working together, the spider stood no chance. It flailed as the ants devoured it. At the end, I had a giant corpse, and some very aggressive ants. They looked at me, then decided to leave me alone. They were full. They returned to their tipped-over ant colonies, which I then flipped back up. The spider was practically just a hollowed-out corpse. It seemed the ants had agreed to split the spoils.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI called the lab which had to have caused the spider to grow so big, and explained the situation. They took the corpse away for further testing, and cut the spider silk binding Millie. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've always loved ants. The way they all pitched in, the way they were like a massive family. But after that day, I've looked at my ant colonies with a newfound fear, and a newfound respect. Despite knowing they could kill me one night, I'll always love my ants.",

        "text": "Some nights when I’m lying in bed, I can still hear the screams of my friends as the last breath they took, they took in pure agonizing terror. I turn on some music, or a podcast, to try to drown out the cacophony of misery- to no avail. \n\nMy therapist tells me that I’m dealing with “survivors guilt”, because I was the only one to make it out alive that night. I still don’t understand why I was left clinging tightly to life, but the answer may be much more sinister than I could have ever predicted. \n\nI did not come out that night unscathed, however. I have large, jagged scars that run down the length of my back, that serve as a reminder of that fateful night in the mountains with my best friends. \n\nI’ve never told anyone the full, clear story of what happened in those mountains. Not the police, not my therapist, and certainly not my family. I’d certainly just end up in a hospital with my mental health being monitored every day. \n\nThis fact alone is why I am writing this to all of you. I need advice; something bad may be happening to me. \n\n———————————————————————\n\nWe had all been planning the ski trip since the summer months. The four of us didn’t have much time to all get together because of our job situations and generally, life itself. \n\nRose’s grandparents had a large winter cabin up in the Smokies, that was passed down to her when they passed away. We all loved our annual winter trips, and this time, we didn’t have to spend so much renting out a cabin to stay in. It couldn’t have been more perfect.\n\nThe morning that we were set to head to the cabin, I volunteered to drive, since my Jeep has good traction and four-wheel drive. We knew that it would be snowing pretty hard on our week long stay, and we didn’t want to risk an accident on the roadways. \n\nTyler was the first of the three that I picked up that morning. He was so full of life, and I remember that his perky attitude and ability to make me laugh really helped in waking me up for the drive. \n\nSarah and Rose lived close to one another, so Tyler and I stopped at Rose’s house to get them both. They hopped in, throwing their bags in the trunk, and laughing about something they’d seen on Facebook that morning. \n\nThe drive to the cabin was an uneventful three hour journey. We spent the time catching up with one another, talking about jobs and relationships. Tyler had just come out to his family, and he vented to us about the strain that it’d put on their family gatherings. He made it into a kind of joke though, of course. That’s just the kind of person he was. \n\nRose was a beautiful and intelligent brunette and was finally engaged to her long-term boyfriend of 5 years. It took him long enough to propose, we joked. Rose was an incredible person to be around, and we knew that her fiancé was one lucky man. \n\nSarah was the most serious of the group. Tall, blonde, and fully at home in a suit, she put most of her time into her job. She had to make a vow that there were to be no work calls during the duration of our trip; we planned on using this time strictly for us. \n\nMy job as a police officer kept me busy most of the time, and I knew I had to really focus on this outing and leave work at home. I was stressed, and had coincidentally had one of the worst cases I’d ever had assigned to me just prior to our trip. I needed this more than anything. \n\nWe arrived at the cabin early, around 10am. I immediately felt so peaceful the moment I stepped out of my Jeep. The snow was falling lightly, and the landscape in this mountainous region of the Smokies was simply picturesque. \n\nWe all took a moment to breathe in the fresh mountain air, smiling to one another. I believe that in that moment, we all felt that same peaceful feeling wash over us. It was absolutely beautiful. \n\nThe cabin itself was something picked straight out of a Hallmark movie. The large, two-story wooden cabin reminded me of ones I had only seen in magazines. It truly was something out of a fairytale. \n\nWe finally gathered our belongings and took them into the house, settling into the four bedrooms that were on the second floor. \n\nThat night, we made a huge bonfire in the fire pit directly behind the house near the tree line. We did all of the usual bantering and laughing loudly as we had a few drinks by the fire. It was one of the most peaceful and beautiful nights of my life. \n\n“So Derrick,” Tyler turned his body to me from across the fire, “any nice ladies in your life? It’s about time you settled down.” I laughed. They were always on me about getting a nice girl and figuring out life with her. \n\nI then shrugged. “I don’t know if it’s in the cards for me right now. You know I’m going to be wrapped up with that case as soon as I get home.” Tyler poked at the fire, a sudden look of pity on his face. \n\n“I’m sorry bro. We just want to see you happy.” He looked up to me and smiled. The others agreed out loud. Rose, who sat directly beside me, put her hand on my shoulder. \n\n“You’ve got all the time in the world, Derrick. We just like to mess with you.” I smiled at her. She was always so kind and gentle of a person. \n\nThey knew better than to ask about the cases that I was involved in. Sometimes the details were very gruesome and they did not want to put a damper on our trip, especially the first night. So thankfully, we dropped that conversation and started talking about Tyler’s love life instead. \n\nAfter some hilarious stories about Tyler’s Grindr adventures and some good, hearty laughing, we decided to head in for the night. \n\nThe others were walking ahead of me towards the cabin when I heard it for the first time. \n\nA branch snapped just loud enough for me to hear, followed by a low, quiet growl. I stopped dead in my tracked and turned to the wood line behind me. I stared into the darkness, attempting to make out any silhouette I could see. \n\n“Derrick, it’s cold! Come on in!” Sarah’s yell from the cabin nearly caused me to jump out of my skin. How long had I been standing there? I took one last look at the dark forest before I turned and walked back to the cabin.  \n\nI didn’t bring up the sound that I’d heard to my friends when we got inside. Looking back, I wonder if that would’ve changed how things turned out. Maybe if I had just said something..\n\nInstead, we bid each other goodnight, and headed to our rooms for the night. \n\nI laid in bed restlessly thinking about the case I was facing when I got back. I worked in the Major Crime Unit, and the case I was working just so happened to be a murder case. The details aren’t important; but the case had me steadily fighting for sleep. \n\nI eventually fell into a fitful and dreamless sleep around 1300 hours. When I woke that morning, I felt utterly exhausted. \n\nI eventually got out of bed when the gentle scent of bacon and eggs drifted into the confines of my room. I slipped on a shirt and headed downstairs, to see all of my friends gathered around the large kitchen. Sarah and Rose were fussing over breakfast, while Tyler sat at a small table and sipped on some coffee. \n\n“I’ll definitely have some of that.” I gestured to his mug. He smiled and jumped from his seat, headed to the coffee machine and grabbed a mug from the cabinet. \n\nI grabbed and chair and pulled it to the table as Tyler handed me my coffee. He took a sip and smiled at me. “We have quite the day planned out, if you’re interested.” I smiled back. “Of course I’m interested. What’s the plan?” \n\nHe looked to the girls and then back to me. “We’re going on a hike, of course. It’ll do you good to get you out in nature, Derrick.” I shrugged and took a sip of my coffee. \n\nRose poked her head over Sarah towards me. “I know this place like the back of my hand! What do you say we camp out tonight?” Why would we camp out if we’ve got a perfectly nice cabin here, I thought to myself. “Sounds like a good time, I reckon.” I pushed all the invasive thoughts of the snow and getting lost out of my head as the girls finished up their cooking. \n\nWe ate breakfast rather quickly, and packed our bags with all we needed for the camp out. Tyler had brought a large tent that we could share, apparently expecting a night of camping out. I still didn’t really understand why we’d camp out in the snow after a day of hiking, but I didn’t want to damper the mood. I like to just go with the flow of things, especially when I was trying to keep my mind off of work. \n\nAs we set out on the wooded path, my mind brought me back to the sound that’d I’d heard the night prior. All I could think about was how we were walking in the same forest that I’d heard that spine-tingling sound from. Unfortunately, this was another moment I could have said something, anything, and could have saved the lives of my friends. \n\nInstead, I kept my mouth shut and hurried along to catch up to my friends and their conversation. \n\n“I can’t believe you’ve never seen Game of Thrones, Sarah. You need to take some time out of your schedule and get on that.” Tyler said as he huffed along. Sarah looked over to him. “I do NOT have time for tv shows, Tyler. You know this. Tyler just shrugged. \n\nWe had gotten pretty decently into the trail at this point. My mind drifted between all facets of my current life as the others chatted away. \n\nThe one thing that stayed in the back of my head, causing a strange and unsettling feeling, was what I’d heard after the bonfire. My mind did all it could to make sense of it. Bears weren’t prevalent in this area of the Smokies, but what could’ve made that noise? How big was it? Were we in danger?\n\n“Derrick, snap out of it!” I was jolted out of my thoughts as Rose stopped and stared straight into my eyes. “We were asking if that clearing looked like a good place to set up camp, and you were completely zoned out!” She crossed her arms and stood still in front of me. \n\n“I’m sorry. Just got my mind on work. I’ll snap out of it, I promise.” She gave me a glare as I looked to where she had gestured. \n\nIt was a beautiful area, almost a circular open field in the middle of the surrounding trees. It overlooked a steep cliff. \n\n“I bet the sunset here would be just perfect.” I replied, smiling at Rose to attempt to ease her growing annoyance with me. \n\nShe relaxed a little and smiled back. Tyler led the way through the path as we entered into the circular field, and we began to set up camp. We had been hiking for a few hours now, it was a good place as any to go ahead and set up. \n\nRose and Sarah spent most of the afternoon taking photos for Facebook and Instagram with the outstanding view in the background. I sat with Tyler and told him stories of some of the things I’d seen working patrol, and we laughed and cut up the whole time.\n\nIt was almost blissful, and for the first time in a long time, I felt joyful. Even peaceful. \n\nAll of the negativity I had been harboring in the back of my head was pushed to the side, and all I could think of was how amazing my friends were and how much I was enjoying myself. I hadn’t felt this way in a long time, and needless to say, I haven’t felt this way since. \n\nLater in the afternoon, we started a large fire and cleared out the snow around the campsite. Tyler had packed two six-packs that he laid in the remaining snow bank to keep them cold. \n\nI cooked some venison I had harvested on a hunting trip by the fire for my friends that night. The smell was mouth-watering, and we were all pretty hungry from the long hike we’d been on that day. \n\nMy friends praised my “cooking skills” as we sat and ate around the bonfire. \n\n“I’ve gotta say, Derrick, I’d ALMOST eat this over hamburger or steak. It’s delicious!” Tyler raved as he took another bite of the venison. Sarah spoke up too. “I’ve never had venison before, and I can’t believe how much I’ve been missing out!” She smiled across the fire at me. \n\nI was so pleased with myself and took the time to look around the fire at my friends, all eating my cooking and laughing with each other. That is the picture that I remember in my head of them, and my favorite memory of our trip. \n\nThe laughing and joking around lasted until the sun set. We were all deep in conversation about different subjects when we all first heard it. \n\nIn the distance, we heard a guttural howling. \n\nIt sounded almost out of place, in the surroundings that I had come to see as so peaceful. We all stopped talking and looked in the direction that it came from. After it stopped, we all silently looked at one another. Tyler was the first to speak. \n\n“Hey Rose, have you ever heard of there being wolves out here?” He asked as he looked confusingly at Rose. \n\nShe shook her head as she continued to look in the direction we had heard the howl. “No. I’ve never heard of wolves. Coyotes, maybe, but not wolves.” \n\nSarah spoke out after a bit of silence. “That certainly didn’t sound like any coyote I’ve ever heard.” She continued as her gaze drifted back towards the fire. \n\nThings got a little quieter after that. I could tell that everyone was a little on edge. I tried a few times to lighten the mood by cracking some jokes, but the others didn’t seem as perky as before. \n\nThis in itself put me back on edge. It seemed like the woods around us became much darker than before, and even a little more menacing. Things were pretty tense for a while. \n\nEventually, Tyler suggested that we hit the hay for the night. My mind was still racing, so I decided to stay by the fire for a while longer while they settled into bed. \n\nI sat there and nursed the fire for what felt like hours after my friends went to bed. Something did not feel right, and the only thing that calmed me down was the .45 I had tucked into the back of my jeans. Surely if anything tried to approach our camp, I could take it out fairly easily. \n\nOr so I thought. \n\nI must have drifted off to sleep out there by the fire, because I awoke suddenly to the most blood-curdling screams I’ve ever heard in my life. \n\nI turned my body towards the tent just in time to see a huge, hairy figure dig it’s way into the tent. Right on top of my friends. I still hear their wails of fear and terror in my nightmares to this day. \n\nMy body stayed stiff as a board, while my hand slowly moved to the back of my jeans where my pistol was still pressed against my back. \n\nAt that moment, what little remained of the fire was just enough to illuminate the blue tent. It was coated in red splotches now, and I knew well enough to know what that meant. \n\nI grabbed the pistol and quickly aimed at the beast that was ripping into my friends. I knew they didn’t have much time by the way that the screams had dwindled down into gurgles. \n\nI thought that I could save them. \n\nI emptied the magazine into the creature, disregarding my hearing and the explosive rounds shooting out of the barrel. \n\nThe part that frightened me the most was after the smoke had cleared. \n\nIt was completely silent, and the beast was nowhere to be seen.\n\nI dropped the now useless pistol to the ground, and finally stood up to my feet. My entire body was shaking with a fear that I had never felt before. I knew my friends were dead, and there was a possibility that I was next. \n\nOur bodies adrenaline is one of the most interesting aspects. Without thinking, I went into a complete rage; I screamed for the beast to come and finish the job. Tears streamed down my face as I kicked the remaining logs in the fire pit, grabbing one that was still well lit and swinging it in front of my face. \n\nIt was at this time that I felt as though I’d been hit by a freight train. It happened so quickly and so suddenly, and I had been screaming so loudly that I hadn’t heard the creature approach me.\n\nIt hit me with the force of a seasoned linebacker and laid me flat on my back, it’s razor sharp teeth embedded deeply into my shoulder. The searing pain was unlike anything I had ever felt before. \n\nHave you ever been faced with certain death? My body seemed to give up, despite the adrenaline rush I had just moments ago. I closed my eyes and accepted my fate, completely giving up. I knew I couldn’t fight this thing, and it could’ve easily killed me without a second thought. \n\nSo when I laid there and didn’t feel the creature digging it’s maw into my stomach, I finally opened my eyes. \n\nThe beast stared back into my eyes from mere inches away, but that wasn’t the part that sent my heart into a frenzy. \n\nIt was grinning at me. \n\nIt’s hairy, wolf-like face was accompanied by piercing bright orange eyes, as they bore directly into mine. It’s teeth were dripping with blood, and that evil grin on its face caused me to hold my breath. \n\nWhat was it doing? Prolonging my death? Making me suffer before it carved my body into pieces? \n\nIt’s face loomed over mine as it continued to smile down at me. My body trembled from my head to my feet, and the scorching pain of the bite to my shoulder was almost unbearable. \n\nI couldn’t fight the darkness that overcame me. I passed out, right there at the complete mercy of the beast.\n\nI awoke screaming, on a hospital bed while the nurses around me sat with looks of pure terror on their faces. I thrashed about, as one of them came and injected my arm with some kind of medicine. After about fifteen minutes of my continuing thrashing and screaming, I finally calmed myself down enough to look around the room. \n\nI watched doctors whispering to the nurses, with a look of utter surprise and disbelief on their faces. I didn’t know or understand what was going on. \n\nThe next day, I woke up feeling….wonderful. My body felt strong and my mood was heightened. The nurse ran out of the room when I sat straight up in the bed and said “Goodmorning” with a smile on my face. \n\nThe doctor came in that morning rubbing his temples and looking at me over the rim of his glasses as he glanced at my paperwork. \n\n“Son, you need to understand something.” He began as he sat on the seat next to me. “You being here is nothing short of a miracle. You should be dead.”\n\nI noticeably cringed. \n\n“The animal that attacked you and your friends dug it’s claws so deeply into your back that you shouldn’t be able to move. You shouldn’t be able to sit up.” He continued, after adjusting his glasses and his posture. \n\n“You came into this hospital with fatal injuries to your chest and back. What I don’t understand, however, is how these deadly injuries seemed to heal themselves- almost overnight.” \n\nHe looked at me curiously and tilted his head, as if waiting for an answer that I obviously didn’t have. \n\nI sat, speechless, as the doctor grabbed a long mirror that was sat in the corner of the room. He sat it up in front of me. \n\n“Pull up your gown, please.” I did as he asked, and my breath stuck in my throat.\n\nJust as he said, in place of bloody, jagged claw marks exposing my flesh, were nearly healed red stripes down my chest. The doctor handed me a smaller mirror so that I could look at my back. It had the same, raised red marks down my back. \n\nIt was impossible. It IS impossible. \n\nBut there is a much greater problem that haunts my dreams every night. Questions that were never answered, by doctors, my therapist, the police, or anyone who was in the hospital that day. \n\nHow did I survive? And why? \n\nOn top of the healing, I’ve noticed…differences. I’ve developed an unhealthy appetite for raw meat. It’s all I spend my money on. Sometimes I feel as though I can’t get enough. I feel everything so deeply now, and the world seems to almost have more colors in it. Almost every night, I see that beast in my dreams: standing above me, and maniacally smiling right back at me. \n\nBut what has finally made me come to this platform to get advice from you all, is what I saw when I looked in the mirror last night. \n\nMy incisors looked huge, far too big for my mouth. And now, every now and then, I can catch a tinge of bright orange in my eyes. \n\nSo, why did I survive? What happened to me? Most importantly, what IS happening to me?",

Some entities appear to be predatory in nature, while others appear to be hostile towards humans on sight.\n\nAddendum: Incident Report XXXX-1\n\nOn ██/██/20██, a team of SCP Foundation operatives was dispatched to escort a small team of SCP scientists through SCP-XXXX en route to the SCP research hub located within the facility. The team consisted of four operatives and two scientists, all of whom had undergone extensive training and preparation for this mission.\n\nThe team entered SCP-XXXX via a designated access point, and quickly began making their way through the winding corridors of the Back Rooms. The team had been briefed on the various dangers of SCP-XXXX, and were armed with standard Foundation equipment including firearms, flashlights, and communication devices.\n\nAs the team progressed deeper into SCP-XXXX, they began encountering a variety of backrooms entities. The first encounters were with entities that resembled humanoid figures, but with distorted features and limbs that appeared to be elongated or stretched out. These entities were relatively easy to dispatch with conventional weapons, but the team soon found themselves facing more formidable opponents.\n\nApproximately ██ minutes into the mission, the team was attacked by a large, spider-like creature. The entity was approximately 3 meters in length, and possessed numerous appendages that it used to crawl along the walls and ceiling of the Back Rooms. The creature was highly aggressive, and attacked the team with venomous barbs that it launched from its body.\n\nDespite sustaining several injuries, the team was able to successfully neutralize the creature using a combination of firearms and improvised explosives. However, the team's progress through SCP-XXXX was slowed considerably, as they were forced to navigate around various obstacles and hazards.\n\nOver the course of the next several hours, the team encountered a variety of other backrooms entities, including creatures that resembled giant rats, swarms of insect-like creatures, and a humanoid figure that appeared to be made entirely out of shadow. The team sustained multiple injuries and casualties, but was able to push on towards their objective.\n\nAs the team approached the entrance to the SCP research hub, they were ambushed by a group of humanoid entities that had been hiding in the shadows. These entities were heavily armed, and opened fire on the team with automatic weapons.\n\nThe team was forced to take cover and return fire, and the ensuing firefight lasted for several minutes. Despite being outnumbered and outgunned, the team was able to successfully eliminate all of the hostile entities, and secure the entrance to the SCP research hub.\n\nThe team successfully delivered the SCP scientists to the research hub, and were commended for their bravery and dedication to the Foundation's mission.

We were in Yellowstone National Park and only a couple days have passed and we have been tracked down and blackmailed.\n\n\"This is bad...\" I said.\n\n\"Don't try and make light of the situation, Travis\". Bryson said with an eye roll.\n\n\"Maybe we can jump out the window while I cushion you from the fall\"? Darius suggested.\n\n\"N-No, if you do that then we could cause the building to c-collapse and increase the risk of people getting injured. A-And we have soldiers in here, who are probably i-innocent\". I said, shakily.\n\n\"Travis are you kidding me?! Are you gonna make us not take our only chance of escape for a few casualties! Think of the bigger picture here\"! Bryson ranted.\n\nI stared at him. He had the same mentality as the facility.\n\n\"Damn it. Look, Travis, I'm sorry, but we need to get out of here\". He said, avoiding eye contact.\n\nI didn't change my mind as we all thought of a new way of escape. Darius suggested barraging through the soldiers but I told him that they probably were prepared for us to retaliate. We watched as they kicked down the door and 8 soldiers piled into the room.\n\nI saw a familiar face enter the room. It was the woman who worked with the director, the one who had  planned a test for me to escape but now I spied a ring on her finger.\n\n\"Hello again Travis, You remember me right? I don't think I ever told you my name\". She said, ushering the soldiers to back up as they were suffocating the small room we were in.\n\n\"Don't tell me you planned this as well\". I said, grimacing the chance that everything we did was fake.\n\n\"Well, no. We never expected such things to happen. Well, me and my husband\". She said and continued. \"Eddie and I have gotten married, ah but i am rambling yet again. My name is Rebecca\". She finished.\n\n\"Look, Lady, hurry up, we need to assign them the mission \". One of the soldiers said.\n\n\"What makes you think we will do ANYTHING for you\"?! Darius snarled.\n\n\"Oh my, Kyle is just a bit angry that he has to work with... what was the word, \"Weirdo's\"? she asked.\n\n\"Freaks\". Kyle said, gritting his teeth.\n\n\"Look, I must get going but you are going to do this mission for us and we will let You, Travis. Only you, quit. And go on your merry way, Harrison was a bit, rash. But we aren't going to kill valuable ...Assets\". She said coldly.\n\nBryson was seething with rage at this proposal but Darius beat him to it.\n\nDarius grabbed Rebecca by the neck and held out his claws near her throat.\n\n\"I won't go back THERE and I will NOT let you hurt my friends\". Darius boomed.\n\nThe soldiers raised their guns and Darius tightened his grip on Rebecca, his dagger-like claws getting closer to her neck.\n\n\"FUCK this, We ACCEPT GODDAMMIT\"!!! Bryson yelled to the shock of everyone.\n\nDarius let down Rebecca and the soldiers lowered their guns. I stared at Bryson. First he had a big picture mindset and now he swore, for the first time.\n\n\"I can't. I'm sorry kid. I have a life to live, I have KIDS. I-I can't waste away my life for your childish dreams\". He sighed. He walked out and nobody objected. A knot tied in my stomach as we were assigned with our mission.\n\n\"Alright, now that the drama is over. You are to help me and my team explore and track down the \"Pilgrim\"\". Kyle stated.\n\nI just stared at where Kyle once stood, now gone.\n\n\"What is a pilgrim\"? Darius asked.\n\n\"Ugh, a pilgrim is someone who travels to places unknown. They wear black clothing that is old fashioned and have hats and buckles\". He said in monotone.\n\n\"He is some kind of wizard of sorts, a cryptid that is humanoid in shape and looks like a pilgrim. He is pretty powerful but not much is known about him. We are to avoid him but keep watch and figure out if he is dangerous or not\". Kyle stated.\n\nDarius had nothing else to say and I was still silent. We all then geared up and headed off into the woods. I was assigned with Darius and Kyle while the rest of the team split up into groups of 3 and 4.\n\nThe woods were beautiful in a way but there was some kind of, ominous presence? I can't really explain it. I  strayed behind to talk with Darius in private.\n\n\"Hey, are you ok Travis\"? He asked, concerned.\n\n\"I...I just didn't expect him to leave us\". I said grimly.\n\n\"I know his scent, we can look for him\". He suggested.\n\n\"Not with all these guards around, especially Kyle, keeping track of us\". I said in monotone.\n\n\"Well, we have each other atleast\". He said and suddenly hugged me.\n\n\"Ack- Darius you're going to crush me\"! I said as he let go of me.\n\nHe laughed with a deep tone.\n\n\"Can't handle a \"Bear\" hug\"? He asked, teasing me.\n\nI rolled my eyes. \n\n\"Darius, when you aren't able to break through a wall, you can give me a bear-\" I suddenly felt something grip my leg.\n\nI watched as a brown claw had latched onto my leg. They were the same claws that had saved me in the past and also almost killed me.\n\n\"Darius-\" I tried to warn him but it was too late.\n\nA large Brown, long humanoid creature rose from the dirt and swung me into a tree nearby.\n\nDarius could only turn around as it launched a punch into his chest, sending him flying past Kyle who was up ahead.\n\n\"How the hell did this thing follow me for so long\"? I thought to myself as it slowly but carefully walked towards me.\n\nIt shrieked as it was barraged with bullets but quickly dashed behind a nearby tree.\n\n\"You guys are seriously being taken down by this? I mean you are a kid but sti-\" He didn't get to finish his sentence when it dashed from it's hiding spot and aimed to crush his head with his claw. It grabbed his head and was about to exert pressure when Darius slammed into the creature, sending them both tumbling down the hill we were climbing.\n\nI tried to get up but I felt a sharp pain in my ribs. I watched as Kyle quickly recovered from the shock and went to aim his gun at me.\n\n\"wait- what are you doing\"?! I said frantically.\n\n\"Look, I used to be all the talk around facility 14 until YOU arrived, causing chaos and security risks but the stupid director was always defending you. That idiot. So I organized a bunch of people to sign a petition to fire the director. It failed but now it doesn't matter, Rebecca will finish the job tonight, and there won't be anyone who cares when one stupid kid is gone\". He ranted.\n\nI looked behind him and my blood ran cold. I saw an old man who was wearing pilgrim clothing. He walked behind Kyle as he was about to shoot at me and flicked him in his neck.\n\nKyle turned around angrily but his face faltered when he saw the pilgrim. He went to scream but the pilgrim was quicker, using his long nails and slitting his throat. The pilgrim looked at me with a grin and dragged the now dead, Kyle deeper into the woods.\n\nI quickly got up despite the pain and grabbed Kyle's gun. I rushed down the hill, almost falling twice to see Darius and the creature still battling, it seemed like Darius was winning when the creature suddenly snapped itself in a position and started twisting Darius's head. I took aim and shot the gun, despite my bad aim, I managed to graze the creature on its temple. It suddenly stopped and looked shocked as the pain registered. That one instant of shock allowed Darius to bite into the creature's head and crush its skull. Tearing the head right off of the creature, I watched and almost vomited as Darius ate the creature's head.\n\n\"What? I'm hungry\". Darius said, looking puzzled at my expression.\n\nI quickly told him about the pilgrim encounter and we got stuck deciding whether to go look for Darius or the Pilgrim. In the end, I decided to go find the other soldiers.\n\nI headed off in the direction I thought the other teams went and found the remains of the smaller group of soldiers after a couple miles of walking. Their bodies had words carved onto them.\n\n\"I love playing hide and seek\".\n\nI shuddered. I picked up a phone one of the soldiers had and pocketed it and it surprisingly was already on when I found it. I left the scene and went out in search of the other team.\n\nI was able to dial 1001 to get an emergency response to come here and I typed this post out using the phone the soldier had. I watched as the sunset and I swore I heard a shriek in the distance. I immediately went in the opposite direction.\n\nI'll keep you updated...",

Always be aware of your surroundings! Make sure that even when speaking with potential customers, you keep an eye out for anything dangerous on the call floor! \n\nTip number two!

Work hard, watch your back, and remember our company motto: \"Get Rich, or Die Trying!\"\n\n...\n\nThat was what I was presented with less than ten minutes after I walked into their office for the first time. A cheesy introductory video that somehow served to simultaneously make me cringe and terrify me. Unfortunately, I didn't have much of a choice but to work here. I'd been fired from my last job for some basic misconduct- and the one before that. I wasn't a bad worker, I usually show up on time and I don't cause any drama, but when someone gives me shit on the phone, I can't help myself. After being bound to niceties and serving those on the other end of my headsets like a slave, telling an entitled, self-absorbed asshat to \"fuck off\" is one of the most satisfying things on the planet. \n\nUnfortunately, the sticks in HR tend not to agree. \n\nWith two terminations on my record, getting a decent paying job was proving tough. It was pretty humiliating, attending interviews only for them to question why I left my last roles. I lie, of course, tell them I was looking for something with more prospects, but after they perform background checks and get the references they need, it all falls apart. I ended up desperate. I needed money or I'd end up homeless, or at best, stuck in some stinking, mouldy flat where my neighbour would sooner stab me than lend me a bag of sugar. That's when I'd gotten the call. \n\n\"Hello Mr Stern.\" The voice came, almost entirely monotone. It was low, sounding almost dazed. \n\n\"Hello?\" I gave my slightly confused answer, disquieted by the timbre of his voice. \n\n\"We understand you have been looking for employment.\"\n\n\"Oh, yeah, I have- did you get my details from the recruitment site?\"\n\n\"We would like to offer you a role as an agent at our prestigious company, KING Sales Group. Do you have the time for a brief interview?\"\n\nI quickly moved past the fact he had ignored my question when he spoke of offering me the job, clearing my throat and trying to sound more professional. \n\n\"Of course! What would you like to ask?\"\n\n\"First question. Can you operate a telephone and computer?\"\n\n\"Y-Yeah, I've worked in call centres all my-\"\n\n\"Second question. Would you consider yourself easily frightened?\"\n\nHe'd cut me off, but his second question made me stop and think. It was a weird thing to ask, but I guessed it was part of their profiling process. \n\n\"Uh... No, not really, I'm always open to trying new things. I consider myself-\"\n\n\"Third question. Do you have a spouse or any children?\"\n\nThe brazen interruptions were getting old fast, but I swallowed my pride. I needed the job. \n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Thank you for answering our questions. We will post our onboarding documents to you promptly. Please read and sign them, then bring them with you to hand in tomorrow.\"\n\nHe ended the call there, before I could ask any further questions. I had mixed feelings. Relief that I'd actually been offered a job, concern that said job would be bottom of the barrel sales work, but above all else, confusion. I'd never had an interview like that, and it didn't exactly paint any sort of picture of who I was. Either way, I'd apparently ticked the boxes. As long as it let me pay my rent, I'd try to stick with it. I looked up the company he had mentioned, KING Sales Group, but information was pretty sparse. I did find a couple of mentions of them working under some big-name brands to peddle their stuff. I leaned back and sighed. Great. Cold calling. \n\nThat same day, the papers came through my door. Inside the envelope that had my address details on it, was a second, smaller envelope, branded with a golden crown and the acronym KING. Classy... The contents were certainly something. Several pages of legal miscellany, and while I had intended to comb through it for anything suspicious, I was yawning by the second paragraph. I focused on looking for mention of pay rate, but when I saw the words 'commission-based' I just about gagged. This was a tough pill to swallow, but after messing up my life like I had, I'd need to get it down one way or another. Skipping to the end, I signed on the dotted line without much thought, took note of the address they listed, and settled down for the night. I made sure I'd picked out my best business-casual attire and my least dirty shoes, ready for my 'big day'. \n\nWhen morning rolled around, I put on my shitty shirt and tie, tied my shitty laces, got in my shitty car and drove to my shitty new job. I followed the online map on my phone down the motorway, until finally it had me take the exit to a sparsely populated parking lot surrounding my destination. As I pulled in, I craned my neck up to look through my windshield at the building, looming tall above. I counted maybe six or seven stories, lacking any sort of artistic architectural design in its huge, blocky structure. It was a wonderful capitalist monument of concrete and glass... Something about it unnerved me, made my palms sweat. Just nervous for my first day, right?\n\nSwallowing, I looked around. There wasn't much greenery, a few token trees on islands of grass surrounded by stone. I could still hear the zooming of cars on the dual carriageway behind me, smell the smoke of their emissions. While this place looked pretty run-down, the cars in the lot were all expensive. While I wanted to take that as a good sign, it somehow made me even more wary. I considered turning around and driving home, but remembered that if I didn't stick it out here, I likely wouldn't have that home for much longer. Steeling myself for a weird and inevitably stressful day, I made my way to the entrance. \n\nThe tinted automatic doors didn't open for me as I approached, so I squinted my eyes to peer through the glass. I could see that sat behind the front desk was a security guard, a bald guy with a dark goatee. He hadn't noticed me, focused on something behind his desk. After waiting a minute, I knocked on the glass, causing him to look up. He didn't make any move to let me in, so I held up my files and spoke loud enough for him to hear through the pane. \"Here for the job!\"\n\nThe man's brow raised at this, before he pushed something that caused the doors to slide open for me to enter. Immediately, I was hit with a heavy smell of stale air, like old carpet and damp mould. Trying not to pull a face, I approached the desk and placed the folder down. \n\"Hey there, I'm Isaac Stern, I'm supposed to be starting in sales today?\"\n\nThe guard eyed the papers, but didn't touch them before he looked back up at me. \"You read the fine print?\" \n\nI licked my dry lips, blinking once. Was everyone who worked for this company a dick? \"Uhh, yeah. Commission-based. I'm fine with it.\"\n\nHe sucked his teeth, shaking his head. He placed a lanyard with a red key-card on the desk as he spoke. \"Sorry bud. Fourth floor. Take the stairs.\"\n\nFrowning, I took the card and turned to the lifts at the end of the lobby. There were four of them, and none looked out of order. \"Right... Thanks.\" As I scanned through the door heading into the stairwell, I briefly thought about why he might've apologised like that, before the creaky door closed behind me with an echoing click. The stairs were quiet, dimly lit by old lights that gave off a barely-audible electric buzz. I looked up through the little gap between the stairs that ascended all the way to the top floor, an arrow-slit of vision that made me feel a little hit of vertigo. Shaking it off, I sighed, and began my ascent. The dirty material covering the steps had a chequered pattern along their edges, the whites all turned grey from age and neglect. I started to feel a little strain in my legs as I went along, passing the second floor, and so began to lean more on the black bannister, gripping it for support as I pulled myself up and along.\n\nLeaning over the railing, I panted for breath, then stopped in my tracks. Narrowing my eyes, something had caught my attention through that window of vision the gap between floors presented. A couple of floors below me, where I had just been, I could make out what looked like someone standing on the ground floor. It looked like a person, staring up at me... My chest rose and fell as I stared back, my heart thumping, blood audible in my ears. I opened my mouth to call out, break the ice of the awkward encounter, but somehow I knew this wasn't one of my coworkers-to-be. Its face was pale, gauntly thin, wide dark eyes that-... that didn't blink. It also looked like they were naked? I could feel a nervous lump in my throat as the two of us held the gaze of one another. I was afraid to take my eyes off of it. I tried to steady myself. This was probably just the office freak. Maybe someone wearing a body-suit, pranking me as some kind of messed-up hazing ritual. I rubbed my eyes, sore from the staring contest, and began to walk steadily further up the stairs and away from the figure. I could feel my hand shaking, legs unsteady, throat dry. It didn't shift, except for to follow my location with a slow turn of its head as I moved from step to step.\n\nIt started moving. Fast. Rounding to the stairs, its sprinting pace activated my fight or flight reaction on a primal level, and I sure as shit chose flight. I stumbled as I started to run, slamming my shin on the hard steps and cursing before I found my feet and ascended as fast as I could. I heard its movements, it sounded like it had dropped to all fours, and its galloping steps were wet, sounding soaked in something oily. Just as it was gaining on me, I made it to the fourth floor, slamming into the wall beside the locked door. I fumbled with my key, glancing over my shoulder in fear that the thing would be upon me, and slammed the plastic card onto the scanner. As soon as it unlocked, I threw myself through and spun to look back. The door had locked again when it closed behind me, and through the glass window, I could see a vague, wet, pale head. One dark eye peeked up and through at me, holding my gaze as I panted, sweating and heaving for breath, before it sank out of view.\n\nAs I came down from the shock, I slowly tuned into the sounds of a call floor. Quiet ringing of phones, clacking of keys, distant indistinct voices using customer-service tones. I steadied my breathing as I looked around, taking in the sheen of laminated walls and the yellowy glow of fluorescent lights. I let the familiar office setting calm me a little, waiting for my heart rate to slow, holding one hand over my chest. \n“Relax… Relax… You need this job… There’s no way that was real…”\nEven as I said the words aloud, I couldn’t convince myself. Whatever that was, it wasn’t normal. But what was I supposed to do? Approach the staff and let them know I was just chased up the stairs by some kind of creature? I’m sure that would end well… \n\nFrom my place in the entryway, I could see there were several rows of desks, setups with computers and phones, meeting rooms separated from the main floor and a small kitchen break-space. Barely any of the desks were occupied, but I did spot maybe a half dozen other folks, which brought me some level of comfort. With a degree of caution, I began walking over to the workspace, documents held tight under my arm. I approached the closest person who wasn't presently on the phone, a tall woman with greying black hair who looked like she might be pushing fifty. Her eyes were glued to the computer screen, her fingers a blur as they typed away. She had an overall intimidating aura, like someone you didn’t have any right to be talking to.\n\nClearing my throat, I tried to present myself. \"Hey, uh, hello. I'm Isaac, Isaac Stern, here for the sales job…”\n\nHer typing came to an abrupt end as she looked at me from the corner of her eye. \"New meat, huh? Let me see that.\" She gestured to the files, swivelling around in her chair to take them from me. I handed them over, and she flipped to the end, eyeing my signature. \"Uh-huh...\"\n\nFeeling some tension, I tried to turn on my 'new-guy' manners. \"I'm looking forward to working with you. It's been a while since I've-\"\n\n\"Catherine.\" She said abruptly, cutting me off and closing the file. \"You can call me Catherine.\" She looked me up and down as I tried not to pull a face at being cut off by one of these suits again. She stood, walking past me to one of the meeting rooms. \"Come on, then. Got a bit of fluff for you.\" Once inside, she turned on the projector, and moved to leave. \"See me when it's done.\"\n\n...\n\nA few minutes later, the introductory video for KING Sales Group was done, tips and all. I was shell-shocked, speechless, and praying it was some kind of sick joke. Wetting my lips and shaking my head, I got to my feet and marched out of the room and back to Catherine, resting my hands on the cabinet beside her desk as I leaned in. \n\n\"Excuse me, but what the fuck was that? Legally and spiritually binding!?\" I practically whisper-shouted, discarding any professionalism at this point. \n\nShe looked at me with a slow blink and frustrated scowl. \"I was right then, you hadn't read the onboarding.\"\n\nScoffing, I looked around briefly. \"The onboarding? I signed up for a sales job!\"\n\n\"No, Isaac, you signed up for KING Sales Group, where you get rich or die trying. Understand?\" She seemed exacerbated with my protests, but she was looking me dead in the eye, with complete seriousness in her expression. Before I could think of what to say next, she pointed to a desk a few spots away from hers. \"Sit down, check the quickstart guide and start dialling. You'll understand soon.\"\n\nI raised my hands to cover my face and dragged them down my cheeks, bringing them to clasp in front of my chin before I moved to walk to the desk.\n\n\"You should look this over for real on your lunch.\" She added, holding the documents out to me. I grabbed them haphazardly before taking my seat, staring at the black screen of the old monitor. With another quiet sigh, still trying to get to grips with the situation, I took hold of the mouse and shook it to wake the screen. A laminated paper blue-tacked to the separator beside the screen outlined the 'quickstart' process.\n\nUSERNAME: ISTERN808\nPASSWORD:  PAWN123 (Change this!)\n\n- LOG IN WITH PROVIDED DETAILS\n- OPEN SCRIPTR.EXE\n- DIAL PROVIDED NUMBER AND FOLLOW ON-SCREEN INSTRUCTIONS\n- ENJOY UNPARALLELED SUCCESS\n- REPEAT\n\nIt felt like a surreal fever dream. I just had to ride the wave at this point or else I'd end up drowning in the crazy. I logged in to a default screensaver, and double-clicked the program for scripting. Its icon was a solid black box with the yellow letter S sat square in the middle. Immediately, the whole screen went black, before a phone number appeared on screen. I looked almost reluctantly at the handset, an old fashioned black device that people use at payphones. Grabbing it, I keyed in the number SCRIPTR had provided, and let it ring. Immediately, the text on screen changed, shifting strangely into a line of text rather than just disappearing or being replaced. After a few rings, I heard someone pick up.\n\n\"Hello?\" It sounded like a middle-aged man, who had a slightly aggravated tone.\n\nFollowing the script, I went to work. \"Hey there David, how are you doing today?\"\n\n\"What? How do you know my name? Who is this?\" His annoyance and confusion was clear, and as much as I cringed at what I was doing, I kept to the script.\n\n\"That's great David, I'm calling on behalf of Omaro Knives, and we have some great product in stock that has your name on it!\"\n\n\"Knives? No, hold on, how did you get my number?\" Annoyance was turning to anger quickly, and I was expecting a hearty helping of verbal abuse any second. \n\n\"Fantastic, how many premium sets can we put you down for?\"\n\nI could hear him growl, and then he raised his voice for real. \"No, no, you listen here! I don't want any knives, and I don't want any more of these calls, I swear, I'll report you!\"\n\n\"You don't want to miss out on this, sir. You don't want to miss out on this, sir. You don't want to miss. You don't want to miss. You miss her. You miss her, don't you?\" \n\nThe script morphed to extend as I read it aloud, the text shaking a little in that black void background, becoming repetitive and bizarre, and while I thought for sure it had to be broken, I then heard the man break down into sobbing. SCRIPTR displayed nothing, and so I said nothing. I remembered tip number three.\n\nThe man caught his breath, sniffling. \"I'll take twelve.\" \n\nSCRIPTR reactivated, and though I was baffled, I continued. \"Brilliant, you've made a great decision today! Do you have your card details handy, David?\"\n\nI proceeded to take a large payment from the man, covering some final scripting before finishing the call with a signoff. \n\n\"Thanks David, they'll be at your door in three to five business days! Have a royal day, and don't forget!\"\n\nThe call ended there. Don’t forget what? I sat back in my chair, shook my head and reflected on just how insane that had been. SCRIPTR had already thrown up a new number on the screen, but I needed a second to think. That guy had clearly not been interested in buying some expensive knives, and the script had made me treat him like an idiot. Something about what SCRIPTR made me say, had some kind of effect. Just as I was working through this in my head, I heard a light clatter. Sitting up, I looked over my screen. What stood just a few feet away from me was... something that resembled a man. He was so tall his head bent crooked against the ceiling, having only a few strands of loose wiry black hair, his jaw hanging long and loose from his skull. His body was distended, covered by a baggy white shirt that hung from his skeletal frame, with dress trousers covering his lower half.\n\nI spent a brief moment absorbing the sight, before I screamed out loud, wailing and falling back from my chair, scrambling to my feet and away from the monster. I backed up against the desk behind me, preparing to scramble over it as the thing watched me closely, milky eyes with beady black dots gazing into my soul- and then he spoke. \n\n\"Awwwwh... I was so close. Oh well. Maybe next time.\" His tone was unnaturally deep, slow-paced and eerily playful. Turning away from me with unnatural, janky motions, he stepped over the desks and headed out of my view. The way his legs rose and fell were as if he were being pulled by unseen strings, puppeted along... At this point, I noted that nobody had been bothered by this occurrence, not the presence of the mutant or my screaming. I walked over to my 'manager', almost breathless. Everything I'd known my whole life was falling to pieces here. This place was wrong, cursed.\n\n\"Catherine... What the fuck was that!?\" \n\n\"That was Lank. He is why tip number one exists.\" She replied with a fairly casual tone. \n\n\"Right, right, of course.\" I said, my words dripping sarcasm. \"And what would Lank done if he had reached me without being seen?\"\n\nShe turned to look at me, adjusting her glasses. \"Torn your spine out, probably. One of the quicker ways to go.\"\n\nI laughed, a dry, humourless laugh. \"Oh great! That's great to hear! I quit.\" \n\nI moved to walk out, but she replied fast and firm. \"No, you don't.\"\n\nStopping in my tracks, I reluctantly muttered my reply. \"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because you make fifty percent commission. Because that call you made just paid your rent in less than five minutes of work, and if you keep making calls, you'll move out of your shitty apartment and be able to lead a life worth living.\" Her glare held me in place as she said this, locking my limbs as my hands trembled. \n\nClenching my fists, I thought about what she said. \"But... If something here gets me, I won't be leading one at all.\"\n\nShe shrugged. \"That's the choice we all have to make here, Isaac. But if you can survive here even for just a month, you can retire and live a cushy upper-middle-class life until the day you die, doing whatever the hell you want. No more shitty car, no more shitty job, no more shitty boss. Understand? Get rich, or die trying.\"\n\nI thought about everything that had happened. Everything I'd been through to get here in my life. My whole existence had been a boring, lonely nothing. All of my failures weighed down on my back, forever threatening to bury me in the lowest tax bracket, in the debts I took on to make it even this far. A loser, that's what I was. But here... Among terrifying monsters and under cheap, fluorescent lights, I could make something for myself. Maybe I was crazy. Maybe the building was messing with my head.\n\nSilently, I walked back to my desk. I picked up my fallen chair, sat down, and stared at the number on the screen. ‘Get rich, or die trying’. \n\nI made more on that day than I had in the last year. I’ve got more to share about my time at KING Sales Group, but it’ll have to wait for another time. \n\nTake care of yourselves,\n\nIsaac",

        "text": "*Ring ring*\n\nI drop my coffee cup in horror, spilling the freshly-made hot sludge down my khaki pants. \n\nWhat the fuck, I say out loud to the empty store. Spinning around in circles I can’t tell where the ringing is coming from.\n\n*Ring ring*\n\nShelf after shelf of antique phones sits silently all around me. Rows of rotary dials are still, but the hair stands up on my arms as if they are watching me. \n\nShaking my head I think, this doesn’t make any sense. None of the phones are even connected anymore. Most of them don't even work. \n\nI pull my cell phone out of my pocket. It reads 11:29 p.m. I know the sound isn’t coming from my cell because the ringtone has been The X Files' theme song for the last 10 years. \n\n*Ring ring*\n\nFear and confusion tug at my stomach as I walk toward the back of the store. The ringing gets louder the closer I get to the boxed inventory I have yet to catalog. \n\n*Ring ring*\n\nBox cutter in hand I start to hack away at the largest unmarked box. Maybe someone dropped their cell phone in the box while they were packaging it. \n\n*Ring ring*\n\nOuch! I scream as the box cutter slices into my left thumb during my unpacking fervor. \n\nBlood drips onto the box as I rip the flaps open with my right hand. Inside the box is a single phone but one of the rarest finds I have ever seen. It is a 1920s-style phone with a classic candlestick design made with a mouthpiece and separate receiver. \n\n*Ring ring*\n\nDark red blood drips onto the rotary dial. Hesitantly I pull it out of the box and set it on the table I use to make repairs. \n\n*Ring riiiiing*\n\nSomehow out of the box, the ringing seems more insistent that I answer. Nervously sucking on my thumb to stop the bleeding my mouth fills with the metallic taste of blood. \n\nI pick up the receiver and put it to my ear quietly speaking into the mouthpiece.\n\nHello? I ask. \n\nAt first, all I can hear is a crackling static. The static clears for just a moment leaving a low guttural moan in its place. \n\nHello? I ask again. \n\nHearing my voice, the moan turns into more of a snarl. I pull the receiver away from my ear staring into its empty black mouth. \n\nI put the receiver back to my ear as a deep husky voice whispers, “dark is heavier than light.” \n\nThe line goes dead filling the store with a baited silence. I put my thumb back in my mouth, sucking on it in confusion. \n\n*Ring riiiiing*\n\n*Ring riiiiiiiiiing*\n\n*Ring riiiiiiiing*\n\n*Ring riing*\n\n*Ring riiiiing*\n\nSuddenly the entire store is a cacophony of ringing. Every phone on every shelf vibrates to life all ringing in their own cadence. I clamp my hands over my ears as the rings get louder and louder. It’s almost as if they are inside my head. I roll on the floor in pain with each ring needling at my eardrums. \n\nAll at once the ringing stops. I open my eyes to see the store just as it always is. Staggering to get up I brace myself on the table and look at the candlestick phone and then at the box.\n\nI didn’t notice it before but there is a small note at the bottom of the shredded box. \n\nIt reads, “To Earl,\n\nSincerely, Bell Labs.”  \n\nI toss the note back into the box and descend the stairs to the basement. I don’t know what the fuck is going on, but I definitely need some sleep. \n\nI converted the basement of the store into my living quarters after my father passed away and left me his business. It’s primarily boxes of old phones in need of fixing that he never got around to, but was too sentimental to get rid of. \n\nMy bed is tucked in the back corner of the room along with a mini-fridge and a steamer trunk where I keep my clothes. The only personalizing I did was hang a string of old multi-colored Christmas lights above my bed. \n\nWhen I was little I would accompany my father to work. As he tinkered away with the phones he would always say, “Son, we have the most important job in the world. We connect people. We help them communicate.” \n\nHe was a quiet man who mostly kept to himself, much like I am today. My mother died when I was really young so my only memories of her are from old pictures. \n\nHis last words to me were pretty poetic for a phone salesman. He looked me square in the eyes and said, “Always answer the phone.” I laughed it off at the time thinking it was a morbid joke from an old man on his deathbed. \n\nThose words echo in my head as I try to doze off in the faint glow of the TV. Knowing that I’m far from sleep I grab my computer and start searching for some online antique forums. I finally find a self-proclaimed antique phone expert under the screen name alx&amp;dr\\_b3ll.   \n\nI describe the phone to him leaving out the part about the ringing so I don’t scare him off. He says he will look into it and as he is just about to sign off I ask him for one more thing. \n\nDoes the phrase, “darkness is heavier than light,” mean anything to you? \n\nNo, it doesn’t. Should it? He asks. \n\nNever mind, I say. \n\nWe both agreed to talk more tomorrow. I close my laptop and plug in my phone to charge.\n\nI set my alarm for 6:00 a.m. and tuck myself under the covers. But my mind won’t stop cycling through the events of the night. \n\nAm I going crazy? Who is Earl? Who sent me this phone? And what does the voice's message mean?",

        "text": "I’m sitting here on my bed, writing this all out quickly before I do anything else. Please, bear with me for any misspelled words. I sat up on my bed, around 2:31 AM I think, and read on r/nosleep. These stories never scare me, so i never had any problems with them. But i came across one, it had such a strange title, “A prediction for the future”. I thought it was weird, but I read anyways. I can’t remember all the details, but it went along the lines of a man trying to kill the woman and the woman does something, though I can’t remember what. He taps on her windows, bangs on the doors around her house. etc. It was your run-of-the-mill simple horror story, so I didn’t think much of it. Once I finished, I closed my phone down and flickered off my lamp, before fluffing up my pillow and starting to sleep for work in the morning. Suddenly, just as I’m about to fall asleep, I hear several taps on my window. I freeze up, slowly creaking my head towards the noises. I grabbed ahold of the lamp and flicked it on, staring at the window, ‘nothing’ I thought, laughing at myself for believing something was actually there. I turned the light back off, settling down twice for the night, before trying to sleep. Not too long after i flick the light off, I hear banging on my door. I shoot up from my bed and flick my light on. The door slowly creaks open, but nothing stands in the hallway, then it hit me. This is how the story started. The woman read  a story on r/nosleep, before the story happens to her. My heart sinks as I hear painfully slow taps on the window behind me, my hands shaking as I clutched the covers. I tried to calm myself down as I began to recall the events in the story. Since it was so late, I couldn’t remember much except the major details. First she reads the story, thinking nothing of it, then she falls asleep. Just as she’s about to, she hears taps on her window, before looking over to it and flickering her lamp on. After assuring nothing is there, she flicks the light back off before trying to sleep again. Again, she wakes to a bang on her door. At this she bolts upright and looks towards it, the door creaking open just enough to show her nothing is there. I begin to cry as I realize everything is playing out exactly as I read, ‘if I’m crying the next would be-’ I didn’t finish my thought before I heard glass break in my living room, I considered trying to see what it was, but I already knew. I heard heavy footsteps as I shakily stand up, tears streaming from my face as I yanked open my nightstand drawer. I kept weapons in case of emergencies, and this one was definitely one. I grabbed the hunters knife in my hand, the metal glistening in the moonlight shining through my window as the footsteps approached. “Knock knock” I heard a man’s voice coo as hot tears stream down my face, hitting the wooden floor and staining my night dress. “You know, it’s rude to ignore others when they’re talking to you” he grumbled, slamming the door open. He wore a black cloak, a strange mask on his face. All I can describe it as is a pumpkin on his head, but it was horribly mutilated. “What do you want from me?!” I screamed at the man, taking both hands onto the hunters knife and holding it out in front of me, spreading my legs in a defensive stance. “You already know how this plays out, right? It’s not a coincidence that story that  appeared on the no sleep community for you to read” he laughed, the throaty noise resonating from deep in his chest. I cried more, if possible, my eyes puffy as I clenched them several times, harshly blinking away the tears glazing over my eyes. “Fuck you!” I screamed, charging at him before thrusting my knife into his stomach, crying into his shoulder as he gurgled in my ear, blood raising in his throat as it started spluttering out of his mouth. “Go to hell, asshole..” I whispered in his ear as I yanked the knife from his abdomen and proceeded to stab him several times. “Fucking die already!” I screeched as I pulled him into me and skewered it into his back, leaving the knife in as he staggered backwards, falling onto the floor. I lunged onto him, yanking his head to the side and digging my teeth into his throat, ripping out chunks of flesh as I chewed them and swallowed quickly before going back to my previous activity. I panted as blood trickled down my chin, splattering onto my baby blue, silky night dress. I stared down at him, yanking the mask off his face and tossing it across the room carelessly. His eyes were shot open, rolled back into his head head as I admired the blood coating his face. “You picked the wrong fucker to kill tonight” I chuckled, yanking him by the arm and dragging him back to my bed. I lifted the covers from the end of my sheets, a horrific smell flooding out in an instant as I stared at the faces of all the others, a smile plastering itself on my face as I stuffed him under. His leg stuck out like a sore thumb, “You would’ve been perfect if you hadn’t had such long legs” I sighed, carefully grabbing it before shoving it upwards, a sickening crunch echoing around the room. I twisted the broken leg, blood spewing onto my floor as I shoved him under my bed once again. I climbed onto my bed, his blood staining my sheets as I lay on my belly, kicking my legs back and forth. It was all in self defense, and I tried telling the police about my psycho ex several times, I had to take it into my own hands, one way or another. So, am I the bad guy for killing my ex?",

        "text": "  \n\nLast weekend I went camping with two friends, Willian and Joana, and my girlfriend, Emily. We parked the car at a house at the beginning of a trail that passed through some waterfalls, caves and other tourist attractions in the forest of that region. We paid the owner for the parking for the weekend and headed towards the green tangle, heavy backpacks on our backs containing tents, clothes and supplies in general. After walking for a few kilometers, we reached a clearing and set up tents. There was a river a few hundred meters away, so we could shower, clean dishes and clothes when we needed to.\n\nOn the first day we stayed in the camp, tired from carrying weight for so many miles. We slept like a rock right after dark, after all we weren't used to making that much effort.\n\nOn the second day we visited the waterfalls and caves. We entered only in the initial parts, afraid to explore too deeply those lightless stone prisons full of insects and venomous animals.\n\nWhen we returned to camp, the sun was already setting and a full moon was up in  the starry sky. We lit a fire and sat around it. After we had dinner, Emily shone a flashlight on her face and began to tell a story from the local folklore.\n\n\\-When I was a child, my parents wouldn't let me come to this place. They said it was because three kids, back in the eighties, had skipped school and gone swimming in that river. One of them began to drown and the two friends tried to help, but in desperation to save himself, the first child ended up pulling the others to the bottom of the river, drowning all the three. After more than a week of searches, they found their bodies already in a state of decomposition.\n\nIn the following years, people began to say that they heard the cries of children when they arrived to this region of the forest, that when they were swimming, they felt small hands trying to pull them into the muddy darkness of the bottom of the river. At nightfall, the children leave the river and look for their families, walking disoriented through these woods. They say that most of the time they just cry and run without doing anything, while at other times they try to pull anyone they find into the river, because they feel lonely living in that wet and cold place. Sixteen people have drowned in this river in the past forty years, so some parents have permanently banned their children from setting foot in this forest. - Emily paused for a few seconds and with a serious expression, after looking at the three around her, concluded:\n\n\\-We are camping here because after ten years of curiosity, I can finally stay in this forest without anyone's authorization and film when the children come out of the river and walk among us. – Emily turned off the flashlight with the intention of causing tension with the end of the story, but ended up looking a little silly because her face was still completely lit by the fire flames.\n\n\\-Come on Emily, why tell this right before we are all going to sleep. – Willian said, visibly bothered by the story, clearly invented for parents to scare their children with the intention of preventing them from roaming the forest unsupervised. He was shaking and hugging his girlfriend, seeming to be trying to hide behind her.\n\n\\-It's just a local legend, it's not real. – Joana spoke while running her hand through his hair.\n\n\\- So, no one died? - Willian seemed calmer. \n\n\\-The death part is true. But nineteen people dying swimming in forty years is not a lot, most of them probably got careless and swam on dangerous parts of the river. As for the children leaving the river, it's obviously a lie, I've been here a lot and I've never seen anything.\n\n\\-But you came here at night? – Emily refuted Joana's statement.\n\n\\-No, we came very early and left in the evening.\n\n\\-There it is, the kids only come out at night, like today. – Emily crossed her arms confidently as she made the statement, as if she had proven the existence of the supernatural.\n\n\\-Stop, Emily! I'm going to throw Willian in your tent and sleep alone if he keeps bothering me about this story.\n\n\\-All right, all right. – Emily smiled proudly for having managed to impact someone with her story.\n\nWe went to sleep a little later. I woke up with Emily shaking my shoulder.\n\n\\-Wake up, wake up. – She repeated in a low voice.\n\n\\-What? What time is it? What happened? - I scratched my eye bewildered by my body still being in sleep mode.\n\n\\-I heard a noise, I think it's the dead children.\n\nEmily had a serious expression, as if she had heard something concrete and believed in the legend.\n\n\\- Emily. We're in the middle of a forest, of course there are going to be lots of strange noises, there´s no way you believe in the fable of those drowned children.\n\n\\-Stop being skeptical man, come on, let's have a look. - She had gotten up and was unzipping the entrance to the tent.\n\n\\-If you really think there are three murderous ghost children out there, wouldn't it be better for us to hide here in the tent?\n\n\\-Stop trying to get away from it, you already said you don't believe in ghosts, so it doesn't hurt to come take a look with me.\n\n\\-All right, all right. – I put on my T-shirt, my flip flops and walked out of the tent with Emily.\n\n\\-Listen, listen. – She put her hand next to her ear as if to amplify her hearing and made a sign for me to be silent and pay attention. Among the dozens of sounds that came from the forest, a wailing that sounded like children crying stood out among them. It came from the direction of the river.\n\n\\-There is a strange sound coming from the river, but it must be some animal or the sound of the current.\n\n\\-It's the dead children, I'm absolutely sure! – Emily turned the flashlight on her face again, creating a ghostly air and deepening her voice while she spoke.\n\n\\-I'm not William, it's no use trying to scare me.\n\n\\-Come then, let's look for the children there. - She pointed the flashlight to the path that led to the river.\n\n\\-Fine. – I walked ahead, already sure that I couldn´t convince her to give up the adventure.\n\nArriving at our destination, Emily waved around the flashlight to every corner of the river and forest. We were surrounded by absolute darkness, so with the exception of the places it illuminated, it was impossible to see more than a blurry few feet in front of us. The current sound was loud and muffled nearly every other sound we'd heard before, leaving us with little information about our surroundings.\n\n\\-Let's wait here, the dead children must appear. – She sat down on a log that served as a bench.\n\n\\-We will be bitten by a spider or a snake in this darkness.\n\n\\-There is no poisonous species in this forest, come on. - She tapped the log gesturing for me to sit there.\n\nI sat there in silence, while Emily furiously moved the flashlight in all directions, trying to find something. After half an hour, I got a little bored and started kissing her neck. She pulled away from my kisses and said:\n\n\\-No making out! Do you ever watch horror movies? A couple that makes out in scenarios like this dies 100% of the time.\n\nI kept silent again, looking around to see if I saw anything strange, but nothing happened. Almost an hour later, Emily leaned against my shoulder and put the flashlight down for a bit. Her arm probably felt sore for moving that much. A few more minutes I heard a snoring, she was sleeping leaning against me. I adjusted myself better and rested my head on hers, also managing to sleep a little later.\n\n\\-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH! - I woke up hearing a loud and horrible scream.\n\nIt was already dawn, the sun was rising on the horizon and illuminating the parts where the forest was not so dense. I shook Emily, who hadn't been awakened by the distant scream. As soon as she opened her eyes, I heard the scream again, it seemed to come from the camp. We got up and started running towards the sound, not exchanging a word to save our breath and run faster. We arrived at the scene of the screams; it really was our camp. Joana was on her knees, crying.\n\n\\-Joana? – I called her name with a little shortness of breath due to all the running.\n\nShe looked at us and changed her expression of dread to one of relief.\n\n\\-My God! I thought you two were dead. Where did you go in the morning?\n\n\\- We fell asleep by the river.\n\nShe made a disapproving expression and didn't ask any more questions. She then started shouting towards the forest:\n\n\\-WILLIAN!!! WILLIAN!!!\n\nWillian appeared after about two minutes and looked at me and Emily.\n\n\\-They only slept by the river. – Joana explained.\n\n\\-I was looking for you two, Joana got desperate when she found your tent open and empty in the morning.\n\nWe laughed, apologized for the misunderstanding and began to pack our things. I went down to the river to wash the dirty dishes before packing them. When I arrived to the log we were sitting, shivers went down my spine, as I noticed there were small footprints on the mud all over the place, like three small children walked around us the whole night.\n\n[X](https://www.wattpad.com/1320484705-insanity-chronometer-chapter-1-fog)",

        "text": "People like me - we’re just like you, really. We may look different, we may have different cultures, live in different places, eat different foods - but we just want to live in peace, be able to survive. We work for our livings, we gladly live alongside you, but you’re determined to push us out.\n\nThe stories you tell about us … You fear us? Sure, that’s to be expected. A good thing, even. But tigers are far scarier, and you actively try to protect them. Us? It’s a different matter. Because we’re different. But we’re just people.\n\nI remember when everything around here was green. At night from the top of the hill, you could see maybe six houses with lights in the windows. Today it’s grey, tarmac and concrete, and you can’t count the houses. You can’t even get to the top of the hill any more; somebody built a mansion up there, surrounded by floodlights and guard patrols.\n\nA few decades ago they built a ringroad around the town. Lights everywhere, and a constant stream of drivers even at night. I could walk for miles before that. Afterwards, I was confined to this small circle. I could hunt far and wide for my food, but now I can barely go two miles.\n\nThen they decided that every street needed to be lit. At least I could roam the town freely without being seen; but no, you had to light up everywhere, so that any evening dog-walker, drunk student, or insomniac would spot me, and force me back into the shadows. My neighbourhood is now so restricted I haven’t seen another like me for years.\n\nYou fear us. You people have so much to give, and we don’t ask for a lot. Just what we need to get by.\n\nI remember when I learned about CCTV. There was a network of unlit back alleys; I could roam around, visiting perhaps fifty houses, taking what I needed. Until one night I reached the end of one, and felt a piercing pain throughout my being. Somebody had installed CCTV on the house at the end. Being seen by streetlight or torchlight hurts, but being recorded was unbearable agony. I retreated back into the shadows of that alley to recover, sustaining myself by the little I could take from the occasional passerby. It was weeks before I had the strength to venture into somebody’s house and get a proper meal.\n\nAnd gradually, this surveillance intensified. I was restricted to just one back alley, eight houses. Then somebody put a video doorbell on their back door, and I was limited to three houses. Now it’s just one. There were a few like me around here in the past, and there might well be hundreds like me in the town now, but I have no way of ever finding them.\n\nWe can’t be known. We live on fear, and knowledge takes that away. My family gives me a little, and the daughter is easy to scare - at least until she grows up. But I’m barely surviving. And now they’ve said they’ll get her a laptop. With a webcam.\n\nThe family are out right now, but left their computer unlocked. Typing this in the light of the screen is painful, but I must beg you. Leave us be! You tell stories of how we kill humans, but that just isn’t true. Perhaps we might **make** humans die, to frighten others, but never by our own … hands, and besides I haven’t done that for centuries. I don’t know what will happen to me when I post this, and tell you about me. Perhaps I won’t survive. But I’m desperate. We just need a little fear now and again. Please, stop trying to know us. Leave us the dark spaces. Leave us unsurveilled. Leave us just a small tribute of your fear.",

        "text": "So a couple of years ago when i was still a kid, i actually had my own bedroom, cause i was an only child, and whilst growing up, i always was told to never, EVER, open the locked closet in my room.\n\n\ni always followed this rule as i was scared of something happening, but i never got enough courage to ask about it.\n\n\nEvery night, when i would try to sleep, i would always hear a strange noise coming from the closet, but i never asked about it, because i was scared of anything happening.\n\n\nfor days, i would hear the closet door being scratched, like a dog was scratching it... but i still never asked about it fearing i would get punished.\n\n\ndays turned into weeks, weeks turned into months and months turned into years, every day i would hear a desperate voice inside the closet \"Please let me out\" with a very deep and non-human sounding voice, followed by scratching, and other weird noises that were generally hard to make out, such as the sound of an animatronic robot moving, and so forth.\n\n\nwhen i turned 23, i was ready to move out of my dad's home, i had planned the apartment i was gonna live in and was generally having a good time spending the last couple of days in my parents' home.\n\n\nbut, eventually a couple of days before i was going to leave the house, i received a call, i had just been fired from my job.\n\n\nthat night i couldn't sleep, i was very angry and filled with rage, i just lost my job.. and the noises in the closet weren't helping me at all during my low, and eventually i got very angry and decided to open the closet, and god forsaken i wish I hadn't.\n\n\nas soon as the closet opened, i could notice, there was nothing in the closet, not clothes, not anything, it was completely empty, but one thing i noticed, was that as soon as I opened the closet door, the entire room felt, cold.\n\nthe whispers in my ear kept getting louder, as the breeze coming from the closet hit me, but i stood there, powerless, realizing what i had just done.\n\ni couldn't even control my body. i was in complete shock.\n\n\ni eventually got control of my body and managed to control myself, and at that point, i had regretted my decision.\n\n\ni booked it out of the room and packed all the important items into my car, as i screamed \"Dad!\", but there was no response.\n\ni eventually felt a sense of fear and trusted my gut with the fact i should get out of there.\n\n\ni drove to a friend's house and begged for him to let me stay for a couple of days, i was so shaken i couldn't even explain the situation to him.\n\nand that entire night, i couldn't sleep. i just couldn't, when i tried i would hear whispers in my ears, and my own brain driving me insane with hallucinations... but i managed to sleep eventually.\n\nand that night, the dream i had was terrifying...\n\n\ni had a dream where i was sitting in a sort of clearing, it looked very deep into the woods, and it was snowing, for some reason, and i was strapped to a chair, it looked like an electric chair, only that it couldn't produce any electricity.\n\n\ni could notice, the shape of a person far away, as the silhouette got closer, i realized, it was my dad.\n\nhe came up to me, and in a muffled non-human voice said \"WHY\" as he started to cry and fell on his knees, begging for forgiveness, but it was no help, before a black fog (like gas) covered him and he disappeared into thin air, and i could notice, the gas was coming towards me....\n\n\nit hit me and i immediately woke up, and i was sweating, but i noticed that, the part that the black fog hit me in the dream, was black in real life...\n\ni could notice my entire body going black, i would lose the power to control the parts which were affected... i had lost.. \n\ni could feel as if i got disconnected from my body, watching it rot from far away.. before i had completely forgot everything afterwards.... i woke up and felt weak, i could still use my body, and that gas like thing hadn't affected me, or did it?\n\n\ni felt like nothing. i could barely move. and the doctor couldn't identify what was wrong with me, so he told me to wait a couple of days and it should go..\n\nthankfully it did, and it's been a couple of years since that incident, but I'm still thankful I'm alive... i still have unexplainable occurrences in my life however... but i can still get on, i would appreciate any tips to stop myself from going insane.\n\n\nit feels like there's something, but when i look there's nothing... i feel like i am being watched...",

        "text": "Currently, I reside inside The Neverwood Facility For Young Monsters. I was asked by my therapist to write down my experience losing my humanity. This is what I wrote. \n\n…\n\nI always wanted to be a mermaid as a little kid.\n\nI guess my fixation first stemmed from my obsession with water—or pools when I was younger. I’ve looked for an explanation online, but there isn’t one. For reasons unknown, as a child I was mesmerised by water. Not real water. But the water on TV. Real water freaked me out. Mom would take me to the local pool during the summer and I have a vague memory of being wrapped in floaties and accidentally bobbing over to the deep end of the pool. \n\nI only went under for maybe half a second, though it was enough to make me realise real-life water was not fun. Real life water could hurt me. The pools on GTA however, when my dad used to play it on the family TV, was where it was at. Yep. I would sit there for hours on end watching my dad playing Grand Theft Auto, waiting for the magical moment when he’d suddenly dive into the sea, or even better, some random person’s fancy pool. \n\nIt didn’t matter if he drowned, I just enjoyed those precious moments of the little character diving into the depths, the funny motion he did with his arms and legs as bubbles exploded around him and the bar at the top of the screen started to flash red. I would crawl over to the TV and press my face against the screen, scanning every pixel for underwater life.  It was the same for every game. If there was a water level or  a pool level, or enough water to submerge my character, I was in heaven. \n\nThe first level in Kingdom Hearts on the beach? I would just force Sora to swim out as far as the game would let me—much to my siblings' annoyance. Hitman (I can’t remember which one) I would direct him into a pool. Regardless of whatever the guy’s mission was, Agent 47 was going swimming. \n\nI’m not sure why I was so fascinated by pools on the TV. They just looked pretty. As I got older, I attached myself to water-related, and then mermaid related media. The Little Mermaid, Aquamarine, and Splash to name a few. I was that kid who searched for “mermaid potions” online and was convinced if I swallowed a glass of salt water and prayed really hard, I would grow my own tail. Thankfully, I grew out of whatever the hell that was. After finding a picture of what a real mermaid looked like, or at least the ones from lore—and they in fact looked nothing like Disney’s depictions, I was put off by them. \n\nEspecially when I read they lured people to their deaths. But that’s every fairy-tale, right? Magic always comes from the darkest and most twisted tales ever written.\n\nI wasn’t expecting to find a mermaid restaurant in one of the most remote parts of Japan.\n\nSure, I knew Japan had some interestingly themed café’s, but this one stood out. It was supposed to be a vacation. Japan—a two week stay in Hokkaido, the northernmost of Japan’s islands, famous for its food, hot springs, and ski resorts. I had spent four years planning this trip.\n\nI was sixteen when I decided I was going to go to Japan in my second year of college, and in the middle of Summer of 2018, three of my housemates and I landed in the capital. After spending the first half of our trip in Tokyo, and stuffing ourselves with mouth-watering cuisine, we were ready for a change. According to every video I had watched on YouTube related to tourism in Japan, as well as Kenji, my half Japanese housemate who was acting as our sort of tour guide, Hokkaido was the best place to find local dishes we wouldn’t find anywhere else. \n\nBorn in the south of Japan and quickly moving to America before he turned two years old, Kenji was fluent in the language despite living in South Carolina for most of his life. It was his parents who were determined not to leave their culture and language behind, so growing up, he had quickly gotten used to speaking both Japanese and American, favouring Japanese when he was comfortable with us, and we  could just about speak the very basics. When he was drunk, Kenji didn’t bother translating. So, we were pretty much in the dark about whatever he was laughing about. \n\nI can admit, however, that I was an idiot for expecting him to know exactly where we were going. I already knew Hokkaido was going to be deserted in places. We were warned that some towns’ populations were tiny, with most of them being elderly people, and not all of them were foreigner friendly.\n\nI could understand that.\n\nI would too if I was them. But we were determined to get the full experience, and if that included being turned away by locals, I figured I could deal with it.  \n\nOur bus dropped us in the middle of nowhere, a small coastal town with a dwindling population. We found the Mermaid restaurant after almost an hour of searching for a place to eat—and getting turned away from three café’s. \n\nAgain, I didn’t blame these people. I would be weirded out too if four tourists appeared in our small little town which wasn’t used to strangers. Kenji would go in to test the waters and see how the locals were—and they seemed okay with him. It was when the rest of us peeked in, the owners eyes sort of widening, and suddenly they were closing soon—and when Sara pointed to the sign on the door which translated to “open late” they were ushering us out, and I was trying real hard not to be offended. \n\nThese guys were polite in the nicest way possible but made it very clear our presence made them uncomfortable. So, we kept looking. Until Sara found a place on Google Maps. The place translated to “water café” and that was exactly what we wanted. Food—and the perfect view of the sea.  It was a ten minute walk, and right next to the ocean. The photos on the website didn’t even give it justice. \n\nThe building was old and crumbling, and yet still standing strong on top of the sea, a giant dolphin carved into the roof. The sun was setting when we rushed in with rapidly melting ice-cream we had gotten from a nearby vendor. Sara was already freaking out because the sea was so close, and Kenji jumped onto a platform and stood on his tiptoes, taking as many different angled photos as possible. The last time I saw the sun for a really long time was that night.\n\nI remember staring up and grinning at a cotton candy coloured sunset which blended in with ocean waves slamming into rocks below. I remember wanting nothing more than to stay in that exact position forever. Moving down the platform set up for outside dining, we were standing right over the sea—and when I peered over, my stomach flipped over. I couldn’t swim well, and yet the idea of diving into the watery oblivion below was strangely appealing.\n\nI was in awe as soon as I stepped through automatic doors into the restaurant, revelling in the air con.  Japanese summers were brutal. Not necessarily because of the heat, but because of the humidity. We had only been there for maybe six of seven days, and I was going through three shirts a day, and maxing out five cans of deodorant. The sudden blast of ice-cold in my air was perfect. \n\nNate and Sara were already rushing inside, freaking out over an ancient vending machine full of brightly coloured seals, and I was following hesitantly behind them, with a nervous looking Kenji at my side. The place was mostly empty to my surprise. It was the middle of summer, and this beautiful restaurant sitting right on the edge of the sea had barely any customers. I guessed it was a small town so they didn’t have many patrons. \n\nThe place was large, lit up in warm golden light and a low ceiling. While Nate and Mina grabbed us window seats and Kenji ordered food, I found myself mesmerised by a large glass tank spanning the circumference of the room. At first, I didn’t see her. I was hypnotised by glowing blue water—my childlike self seeping back into me. But then there she was, a beautiful woman with hair the colour of the night. \n\nAt first I thought she was some kind of performer doing water-tricks for customers. Then though, I realised she didn’t have legs. Instead, a long bluish tail. For a moment, I was startled. Looking at this girl, there was no sign of breathing equipment or even an inclination that she was struggling to breathe underwater. And yet there she was, right at the bottom, her hands pressed against the glass. I couldn’t resist, pressing my palm to the ice-cold surface. I wanted to join her, suddenly.\n\nThe water looked so good. So tempting.\n\n“She’s not real, genius.” \n\nA voice startled me, and I twisted around to find Kenji three inches from my face, a smirk curving on his lips. It was his ponytail which had attracted me to him upon first meeting. At that point, he’d said he couldn’t be bothered to cut it and was waiting for the right time. He never did. \n\nNow, it was his staple style; a loose ponytail, stark black hair straying in playful eyes, and a dimpled smile I often found myself captivated by. Kenji was the first guy I had met who suited ponytails, and that only attracted me more. Moving in with the guy, however, had made me realise he was more of an annoying  younger brother type. You know, the kind of guy who never cleans up after himself and has an unhealthy obsession with video games. I was expecting him to join me. His facial expression was teasing as usual, brown flecked eyes drinking me in, a brow raised. When I could only frown at him, he shrugged and pointed to a sign stuck to the tank—which I had failed to notice. “I’m not great with Kanji, but I’m pretty sure that means she’s fake.” Kenji nodded to the sticker. “See? It says it right there.”\n\nTurning back to the girl in the tank, I could only protest with a hiss. When I was really looking, though, I noticed her tail wasn’t moving—or it was, but only in intervals. Her face looked real, but her body was more of a mannequin-like form which looked robotically controlled. When the mermaid’s fingers tapped the tank, I had to hold in a hiss. Jeez, I couldn’t believe I thought she was real for a moment. “Her name is Ai.” Kenji’s gaze was on another sticker which I failed to notice.\n\n“*Nise*” Kenji translated, poking me in my cheek. “Also, fake. If you could read Japanese, which you can’t,” he shot me a grin. “There’s an explanation right in front of you.” He read it out in Japanese, where I could only understand maybe three words before translating.\n\n“Ai is said to be the last of her kind, and has been with us since we opened,” he read out. “Please treat her with kindness and do not put your hands on the glass.” Kenji frowned. “It’s said that Ai and her family were hunted for their flesh which was rumoured to hold the key to immortality and power. When her siblings were brutally killed and skinned by fishermen, Ai cut her heart into pieces and dropped it into the sea.” Kenji squinted. “Shit. It’s hard to read because half of it has been rubbed off…” \n\nHe groaned. “Uh, something about her cutting out her own voice box to prove to the town she wasn’t a threat. She offered to grant four town’s people’s children power in exchange for her life being spared. They tried to kill her that same night, and she fled the town. They built this to commemorate her.”\n\nStraightening up, Kenji pulled a face. “So, in conclusion? Human’s suck.” He heaved out a sigh. “Buuut, we knew that already.”\n\nI couldn’t resist my gaze flicking back to the mermaid. “They built this to remember the girl they supposedly…” I lowered my voice into a hiss. “Hunted and skinned?”\n\n“They killed her family.” He corrected, pointing to another sticker. “She had two brothers and two sisters. Their voices were ripped out.”\n\nIn the corner of my eye, Nate and Sara were manically gesturing us over. “Why would they be threats with their voices?”\n\n“You’re kidding.” Kenji arched a brow. “Have you ever heard of a Siren? You know, bloodthirsty fish people who lure fishermen to their death? Why do you think Ursula needed Ariel’s voice?” He knocked on the glass of the tank. “To hypnotise Eric, and like, take the throne, or whatever. I think I fell asleep halfway through the second movie with the other mermaid.”\n\nI couldn’t resist a laugh. “You mean her daughter? You’re strangely knowledgeable on The Little Mermaid lore.”\n\n“Yeah, well, having you as a housemate for the last few years has turned me into a Disney freak.”\n\n“Hey! We need a translator!” Nate, while trying to be polite, was doing a hell of a good job at getting our attention.\n\nI gestured for him to shut up, and he immediately stopped dramatically waving his arms. Nate Costa was an introvert inside an extrovert’s body. By that, I mean he looked like he played college football and definitely had the form for it, broad shoulders and built like a brick wall, but preferred to hang out with the resident cat at house parties and had recently gotten us all obsessed with Criminal Minds.\n\nBrandishing thick, reddish curls and pasty skin, my housemate definitely stuck out like a sore thumb. Sara was half Korean on her dad’s side and was probably the most beautiful girl I had ever met, willowy brown hair framing a heart shaped face.\n\nLike Nate, she was quiet around strangers, and a menace when it came to just the four of us. The two of them deserved each other. Two little awkward peas in a pod. \n\n“Kenji!”\n\nNate was getting impatient.\n\nRolling my eyes at them, I gestured to the table they had sought out—and after one last look at Ai, the two of us made out way over and quickly took our seats. It was dark outside by the time we had ordered our food. The menu’s weren’t in English, though were expecting that. Thankfully, Kenji helped us pick. I did notice there weren’t many employee’s; only a guy in his early twenties, his identity hidden by a mask. I turned in my chair to marvel at the eerie glow of the half crescent moon illuminating the sea below, when a perky waitress practically dived to our table, and immediately took an interest in the boys. \n\nShe was nice enough to us, nodding and bowing, setting four glasses of water down. \n\nBut then her gaze flashed to Nate, who was frowning at the lack of signal on his phone, and Kenji peering at the menu. Initially, it was a fairly normal dining experience. I got a soupy like broth and noodles with its own local name. I was halfway through it, practically salivating it was so good, when the waitress appeared again with bright eyes. This time, she grabbed Kenji’s arm and dragged him to his feet. It was playful, though there was a glimmer in her eyes, a certain twist in her lips which told him he didn’t have a choice.\n\n“Boys.” The waitress was grinning wildly. She gestured a clueless looking Nate to get to his feet, and after getting the go-ahead smile from Kenji, he did. Looking thoroughly confused, and slightly scared, my housemate couldn’t have looked more awkward. His gaze kept going to his unfinished meal, but every time he made a move to return to his seat, the girl made a protesting sound. I was nodding and smiling at this girl, giggling when she said something in English, referring to the boy’s as special, but when I was really looking at her expression, her eyes seemed… still. Unblinking. Almost like she was looking right through me.  When she laughed, there was no contortion in her facial muscles, and I could have sworn there was something tingeing her face, like a sickly green mould creeping its way across her cheek. \n\nThe more I was looking at her, she was beginning to resemble Ai in the fish tank; her body moved in twitching intervals to mimic human movement but there was no real life in her face. I was ready to grab my friends and make a run for it. Especially when she started to repeat the same thing over and over again in both Japanese and English, her grip seemingly tightening on a squirming Kenji’s arm.\n\n“Boys!” She gasped out in a breathy laugh, gesturing over to the counter. “Danshi.”\n\nSara laughed nervously, shooting me a look. She had already finished her meal, sipping her water.\n\n“Uh, what’s going on?”\n\nKenji didn’t exactly look like he was enjoying himself, trying to wrench from the girl’s grip, but his slightly strained smile was reassuring. I didn’t trust it though. \n\nHis expression, unlike the girl’s, was filled, ignited, with life. Life, which was silently begging us to do something. “They’re just surprised to see us,” he said, when another girl seemingly came out of nowhere, and latched herself to Nate. When the two of them were dragged away, I had no idea what to do. \n\nI jumped from my chair, with Sara following suit, but Kenji was quick to twist around. “They’re just excited to see us!” He shouted. “We’ll be back soon, okay?” From the tone of his voice, I could tell Kenji was lying. He had no idea where the fuck he was being taken and was subtly telling us to maybe call the cops if they were gone for too long. \n\nNate was quieter. He may act like an idiot sometimes, but the guy was on anxiety medication. We were in a partially deserted town in the middle of nowhere with several slightly unhinged waitresses who were treating him and Kenji like god’s, the guy was bound to be freaking out. \n\nI watched the two of them  shoved into the back room behind the counter, and when I was sure we were alone, I slumped back into my seat with a choked out laugh. Sara’s eyes were wide. She kept glancing at her phone frantically, and I shook my head.\n\n“They’re probably…just talking to them, or whatever.”\n\nSara squeaked. “You think that was just casual friendliness?”\n\n“Sara, they’re just excited.”\n\n“I wouldn’t call that excited,” she took another sip of her drink and fanned herself. “Did it get hot in here?”\n\n“Relax. They’re fine.”\n\n“That was obsession,” Sara was sweating, I noticed. “Hysteria.”\n\n“Well…” I thought back to the vacant look in the waitresses eyes, and my stomach twisted into knots. “Yeah.” I drained my water, suddenly feeling nauseous. Had it gotten hotter? I could have sworn the air-con was still on, but my arms suddenly felt like they were burning.\n\nSettling my housemate with what I hoped was a reassuring smile, I announced I was going to get more water. But when I jumped up, my head sort of… danced. I’m not sure I can put it into words. It didn’t spin. I knew what a spinning head was—the aftermath of a long night and too many strawberry daiquiris. This was different. Instead of spinning off its axis, my brain felt like it was bobbing up and down. I remember somehow staggering my way to the counter, suddenly incredibly thirsty, a relentless burn at the back of my throat. \n\nIt was everywhere, an ignition of fire which had started on my arms, moving down to my legs, and creeping across my gut. “Hello?” Forgetting Sara’s existence, I was suddenly all too aware that as well as feeling like I had just been dipped inside molten lava, I needed to drink something. Whether that was water, soda, fucking sewage. I didn’t care. I just needed something to quench this inhuman scratching at the back of my throat.\n\n“Hey!” My voice became a panicked yell, and part of my brain which wasn’t choked with fog and cotton candy realised Sara was silent. It took maybe half a second for my vision to be reduced to blurry pinpricks—and when I squinted, grasping the front counter for an anchor, I glimpsed movement through the back room doors. \n\nA flash of movement, footsteps running, a shadow bleeding into view; a shadow I knew. Kenji. I saw half of his face. His was hair soaking wet, strands plastered over half lidded eyes. It wasn’t until I saw smears of red under his nose, and red tinged water soaking his white shirt, when my brain kicked itself into gear. \n\nHe was so close. So close to the door, his fingers gripping onto the side, only for a monstrous arm to whip out and slam a hand over his mouth, muffling his cry and yanking him back violently. When the door slammed behind him, I remembered how to walk. But I… couldn’t. My body felt like it was on fire, and suddenly all I wanted to do was throw myself into the tank with the fake mermaid. I remember my legs giving way. Just like that. One moment I could feel my legs, and the next I couldn’t.\n\nI was lying on my back, blinking rapidly at something squirming under the flesh of my arms, when a shadow loomed over me. I couldn’t concentrate on her words, on her broken English, as my gaze followed a greenish tinge tearing its way up my arm, and like a virus, it was spreading, filling my veins and expanding further and further until I could feel it choking the back of my throat. I felt it writhing up my throat, my body jolting as I choked up mouthfuls of water.\n\nIt felt… good. At least for the hazy moment I was trapped in a singularity where time didn’t exist and I was mesmerised by the contortions in my chest. \n\nIt didn’t feel natural. Nothing felt natural. Not the green tinge entangling my veins and seeping into my bloodstream, or the convulsions in my throat every time my body forced fluid from every orifice, leaving me to choke on my own liquidised insides. \n\nThe girl, however, told me with simple touches, her dancing fingertips across ignited bones, that everything was going to be okay. The water which gushed from my mouth, nose and ears—it soothed my skin which was on fire. It was salt water, stinging my flesh at first, but then caressing me like I was already enveloped in the ocean. “Child.” The shadow bled into a real person, and blinking through fog, I could have sworn I recognised the hair which ticked my face when she bent down, her cool hands wrapping around my body,  and claw-like fingernails pinching my skin. \n\nShe spoke in Japanese first, followed by English. Her hold on me was oddly gentle, and I was grateful for her cradling my body to her chest. When a thicker texture than water slithered from my mouth, and I glimpsed thick rivulets of red dripping down my chin, I squeezed my eyes shut and prayed for it to stop. But it didn’t stop. \n\nIt kept going, purging me of every liquid in my body. The woman’s voice was a melody singing inside my head lulling me to slumber, as she moved in slow, solemn strides. Like I was attending my own funeral. Something snapped inside my mind like a switch being pulled, and the hazy fog drowning me began to subside.\n\nI felt how light I was in her embrace, every mouthful of water spilling from my lips felt like razor blades cutting me into pieces. I felt like I couldn’t breathe, and when I did, when I sucked in precious gasps for air, my lungs rejected it, stars speckling my vision. It was like drowning, I thought dizzily as the woman rocked me from side to side. I was drowning on land. I was drowning with air in my lungs, and no matter how hard I tried to force my body to realise that, it kept panicking.\n\nSister.\n\nI recognised the word for sister floating through my brain.\n\n*Eien ni ikitaidesu ka?*\n\nHer voice rattled in my ears, followed by the translation – and I allowed the sound of crashing waves to take me away.\n\n“Would you like to live forever?”\n\n…\n\nI woke with a static radio inside my head and the sudden sinking feeling that I couldn’t feel my legs. I was in a tub overflowing with water, my numb body enveloped inside its depths. It felt like a prison, almost. I felt it lapping under my chin as I sunk deeper, my head sliding down cold porcelain.  The burning had stopped. The pain which encompassed me, and the thirst igniting my throat. \n\nAll gone. \n\nBut with it, so had every other feeling. I could see ice bobbing in front of me, and yet failed to feel the sensation of the cold. It was shock, I thought. Surely. I waited for familiar sensations to hit me and propel me into fight or flight,  but I was numb.\n\nI couldn’t feel anything. For a moment, my brain was sticky with fog, before my vision cleared and I drunk in my surroundings; a large bathroom with marble walls which were supposed to be pristine white, and yet were splattered and smeared old red. I could see it on every surface, on the floor, dripping from the walls, and staining the tub I was in. When I tried to force myself into a sitting position, I couldn't move. \n\nMy right arm was cuffed to the tub, and in front of me, I couldn't even see below my torso. The water was too murky, a soup of red dilated around where my legs were supposed to be. Tugging my arm, panic creeping its way up my throat, I glimpsed something which wasn't right. It didn't look right-- but for the moment my mind couldn't register it. The skin on my arm didn't look like skin anymore. Instead, resembling marble, and like a virus it was growing, expanding across my elbow and creeping its way towards my shoulder. \n\nA scream tugged in my throat, and I forced my body to move-- to do something. But it was less like a body, and more like a mass severed from me. My gaze flicked to plastic curtains stained that same deep shade of red-- before a shadow appeared. \n\nThe curtain was pushed back, and I was greeted to a figure wearing a plastic apron, a mask hiding their identity. They knelt in front of the tub and dipped their finger in the water before pulling it out. I drowned in silence for what felt like forever while the figure turned and sorted through metallic instruments, before a sound shattered my ears. Splashing. And when I strained my ears and struggled to push through the fog… choking, spluttering, and what sounded like pleading.  I knew that voice.\n\nI knew the cries collapsing into gurgling, and if I concentrated, I could sense his flailing body. Nate. When I twisted my head, I  see him across the room, strained against crimson stained marble, his head being forced into the freezing depths of another overflowing tub while the rest of him struggled, battering arms attempting to shove away his attacker. But failing.  \n\nThey were drowning him. Killing him. \n\nThe words entered my mind and I expected my body to react, but there was nothing, just the jolt of my arm still attached to the cuff restraining me. \n\nI felt my lips curve into his name, but my voice splintered in my throat, shattering into nothing. When the sputtering sounds stopped, and my friend’s body went limp, I had no time to register what was happening. Nate was picked up and carried away, a sopping wet tangle of limbs dangling from the woman’s arms, and the figure kneeling in front of me had finally picked an instrument. It resembled a scalpel with sharper teeth, and when he held it to the light, cocking their head, I wondered if drowning myself would be appropriate at that moment. If sinking deeper under the water would allow me to escape whatever this person—this monster—was going to do to me.\n\nI watched in feverish anticipation as they removed their mask to reveal a smile with too sharp teeth. It was a guy, not much older than me. Western, judging by his features. I could only guess he too used to be a tourist. But I couldn’t possibly call him a guy, or even human. Now I was fully drinking him in, his eyes were a milky white and resembled the waitresses from earlier. There was an emptiness in his expression, a vacancy in his eyes. \n\nAnd when my gaze allowed itself to wander, I was seeing more of him; what he had been turned into, or at least almost been turned into. Under the sputtering bulb above, I could just about make out that same green tinge I’d seen onmy arms. This time it had eaten its way through half of his face, and I didn’t even realise until his grin widened, his mouth more of a skeletal sneer. When he reached forward and shoved my head under the water, I glimpsed what was left of his arm, shrivelled up flesh entwined with something resembling scales.\n\n“Breathe.”\n\nHis voice was a low murmur above the surface, and when I struggled, or tried to struggle, he pushed me deeper, water gushing into my mouth. I expected my body to panic, to flail, but it was paralysed without legs. I was forced under the surface three times, and it was only the fourth time, when the guy was getting increasingly more frustrated, when it hit me what he was saying. “Breathe.” \n\nHis almost robotic tone hummed in my mind, and I did. Instead of fighting against the water seeping into me like usual, I sucked in a breath and breathed out. And once I did that, noticing my body and brain had failed to react like they were supposed to—I was dragged back to the surface, and his skeletal smile was three inches from mine. He held up the scalpel, and something snapped inside me. No. I mouthed the word when I realised what he was going to do. But I didn’t have a voice. There was just strange hissing around every time I spoke, like my voice had been severed from me. Ignoring my silent protests, the guy forced me onto my side, and I felt it automatically, a heavy mass underneath me which didn’t feel like legs. I kept wondering if they were gone. \n\nThat’s what it felt like. These maniacs has cut off my legs and replaced them with… with what? I didn’t feel the blade slicing into my flesh at first. I was numb. I couldn’t feel anything. But then he was putting far too much pressure on it, dragging the scalpel deeper and deeper until I could feel the teeth cutting through muscle and bone. He made four single strokes before forcing me onto my back once more. \n\nWithout a word, and putting his mask back on, the guy straightened up and stepped back, tugging the curtains shut. It was only when he had left me bleeding out into icy cold water, I started to glimpse what was in front of me. When I was a little girl, I had sat in my bathtub and stared real hard at my legs, wishing and wishing and wishing they would somehow morph into my very own mermaid tail.\n\nBut those types of mermaid's didn't exist. The ones we want to be, mermaids with magical powers and fish friends. Every child's dream. As my own blood diffused the water around me, my eyes found the horrifying mass of flesh which had grown from my torso, fusing my legs together.\n\nIt wasn't finished. I could still see its progress, the greenish flesh-eating thing which had eaten away at that boy's face was ravaging through my own body, transforming skin and bone into something else entirely. I don't remember screaming because I no longer had a voice. But when I continued to scream, thrashing against cool marble, I felt it, something went and warm with the texture of soup, or maybe barf, dripping from my mouth every time I attempted to use my voice putting pressure on my vocal chords, blood filled my mouth in fleshy lumps which I had to spit into the water or swallow down. It was when my vision was blurring with stars, and another shadow had come to lift  me from the tub, when I realised I had choked up what I was pretty sure was my voice—or at least the shredded organ which allowed me to speak. Time passed.\n\nI wasn’t sure how much. I vaguely remember being carried down a long hallway which felt like it stretched across the universe. I do remember the woman held me gently, almost like a mother holding her child.\n\nInitially, when I was still human, or at least when I could still breathe without water, I was left inside a tiny room for days, like they were waiting for me my body to reject air—to reject land. Every so often, they would come in and pour a bucket of ice cold water over me so I could breathe. \n\nI stopped reacting when my body started to climatise. Consciousness was cruel. I delved into the dark and prayed to stay there. But once the thing had finished with my legs, or at least what was left of them, it wound its way through my body, purging me from the inside. There was something I couldn’t ignore. I heard it for the first time in the tub, but now it was stronger. Like a physical thing trying to crack my skull open. Screams. Though they didn’t sound like they were coming from anywhere near me, or rooms nearby. They sounded like they were directly inside my head.\n\n*“Where…. am I?”*\n\n*“I can’t breathe. My chest feels like it’s…burning….I’m hungry. I’m so… so fucking… hungry.”*\n\n*“Why can’t I move? I can’t…. I can’t… move!”*\n\nI don’t remember being dropped into a large tank—only waking up and realising I was underwater. It’s not exactly the reaction you might think. I still felt human, even when half of me wasn’t. \n\nSo, the human part of me freaked out, once I was aware of being enveloped in icy depths and my hair spiralling around me in a vicious halo, I panicked and tried to project my body to the surface. \n\nBut I couldn’t swim. I never learned how to swim properly so my body just flailed pathetically, and I was forced to come to terms with what was part of me, the disgusting writhing thing which had grown from my torso. It wasn’t a tail. It was too big to be a tail. I couldn’t even move the damn thing. When I slammed my hands into the glass of the tank, a noise splintered its way into my skull. It started like static, like a radio being tuned in, before a voice exploded into my brain. \n\n*“Don’t freak out.”* Kenji. I’d known him for almost three years, and no matter how hard he was trying to sound reassuring, he himself was definitely freaking out. His voice was barely comprehensible, more of a garbled confusing string of static I had to replay in my mind until I could understand it. It came again, this time slamming into me in wave of white noise. *“She wants to talk. We’re… we’re going to let her talk. She said if we don’t listen to her she will consider us unfriendly.”*\n\nTalk?\n\nTwisting around in blanketed depths, I could barely see anything. The water around me was filthy.\n\n*“Cass!”*\n\nKenji’s voice was an impatient hiss scratching against my skull. *“Will you listen to her?”*\n\nI jumped when a knock sounded, and there he was on the other side of the glass.\n\nIt was the white in his eyes I saw first; a milky glow which was spreading around his iris almost resembling a crescent moon. Kenji was pale, soaking wet, and half of his face had been taken over by the same thing which had stolen my legs. \n\nI could see it eating away at his flesh, converting skin to scale, or half skin and half scale. Looking at him, the guy didn't even look like my friend. More of a mimic. \n\nI could almost resemble him to a... fish. The hollowness in his face, gaunt cheeks, and much sharper teeth when he opened his mouth to speak, before shaking his head, his lip curling. His body was still his at least. Though that thought crumbled in my mind when I realised he was struggling to stand. And when I looked closer, his bare feet on marble flooring were webbed, each toe beginning to fuse together. Kenji had legs. They were awkward and stumbling, and he was clearly having a hard time staying upright, but he had them. I just wasn't sure how long he would have them for. \n\n*\"She said we're... beautiful,\"* Kenji whispered into my head, each word sending sharp rivulets of red dripping from his nose. *\"We're the most beautiful beings she has ever seen, and she wants us to stay with her,*\" He paused. \"*She lost her siblings, and she's been...\"* He screwed up his face, and for a moment it looked like he was struggling to breathe. His gaze was suddenly on the tank, on the water imprisoning me. I knew exactly how he felt.. His lungs were burning. *\"Lonely.\"* Kenji finished. *\"She's been so lonely, and humans amuse her. They excite her.”*\n\nAi, I thought. \n\nHe was talking about the mermaid on display. \n\nKenji continued, and I could tell from the look on his face he was repeating Ai's words. *“She is the last of her kind. And after hiding for so many years, she has decided to find her family again by cutting her own heart into pieces, and… feeding it to customers.”* Kenji’s swallowed. *“And we… we’re the only ones who… who survived the process. The rest of them... drowned, or rejected the change. But Ai has never hurt the ones she tries to change. Instead, they... they stay with her, and those pieces of them are granted eternal life with her. As she searches for her lost… siblings!”* This time, what had been his attempt at a calm murmur collapsed into a strangled cry when something grabbed him. When Kenji disappeared from behind the glass suddenly, I panicked. His voice, though, continued, echoing in my skull. \n\nHe sounded like he was moving, or more likely being dragged. *\"She says... we have to embrace it. If we don't, we will have no choice but to become part of her forever and offer her our... humanity. Those who stay at her side sacrifice half of themselves while she continues to… to… uh--- shit!”*\n\nA loud splash sounded from the surface, and I found myself with a face-full of bubbles as water sloshed around me.\n\n“Silly boy.”\n\nHe gasped out in my head. But I heard her voice too. It was perfectly clear. It was almost like their voices were intertwined.\n\n“You… amuse me,” she chuckled, speaking in both Japanese and English. “Two full days and your lungs still crave air.”\n\nHer voice was melodic, a hypnotising murmur which filled my brain like cotton candy. *“You…. amuse…. me.”* Kenji’s mental cry came out in sharp bursts of static. *“Two… full d—days… and you still… crave… air.”* When I tipped my head back, I glimpsed a slender wrist delve into the water and grasp hold of him, yanking him out. Kenji didn’t speak after that. \n\nI heard an attempt, though whatever connection had entangled our thoughts was severed once Ai had yanked him to his feet and pulled him away. I was slamming my hands into the glass, as if I could break it if I kept throwing myself against it, when something moved behind me. I saw it, a shadow looming. \n\nTwisting around, I found myself face to face with what was left of a human skull. It was attached to something which had withered away, eaten at its body. But once I was seeing it, and I was looking around, glimpsing shadows which bled into half eaten corpses. I could still see where that thing, the thing which had been forced into my blood, had attempted to convert human tissue into scales, and ultimately failed, skinning them of their flesh.\n\nMutilated legs and half grown tails.\n\nI was inside her experimentation tank—where humans she turned either submitted to her or were eaten alive.\n\nKenji falling in must have caused a rift in the water, dislodging every failure from hidden depths. Every human whose legs refused to morph, to transform and metamorphosise into a monster, surrounded me, and I just had to hope and pray that the hand wrapped around my wrist, claw-like fingernails slicing into my flesh—was human. Even in the pitch dark water, however, I could still see the glint of red hair, the shimmer of pasty skin which had always looked moonlit in contrast to hair. Now though, it was sickly and pallid. \n\nNate was breathing underwater, there was doubt in  my mind that he had surpassed that stage. His body, however, was still human. His eyes were still his, if only for the slightest tinge of white spotting his pupil. If I looked close enough, I could glimpse strips of his flesh skinned by the water itself, as if made of tiny, perforating blades. I had seen was a success, or at least the beginning of a success was in Kenji. Now that I was face to face with Nate, I understood was a rejection was. \n\nNate's eyes were wide, almost cartoon-like, his mouth open in a silent cry, as his legs, which had failed to fuse into a tail, were slowly ripped apart, chunks of flesh floating around him.\n\nThe guy's grip tightened on me, bubbles erupting around him. His mouth opened, and I caught what had been the start of sharpening incisors, before stopping abruptly. \n\nWhen his mental cry slid its way into my mind, his deafening, pained screams rattling my skull as I watched the skin on his face transform into a fleshy scale-like substance, only one thought brewed in my mind. And it was enough to elicit my own screech joining the cacophony inside my head growing louder and louder, each of us encompassing each other.\n\nFuck my childhood wish.",

        "text": " I would like to think that we’ve all played that game; you know the one, someone says 3 sentences and you have to guess which one is the lie and which ones are the truths. In my small town it's a given, though it's not that hard to tell what's a lie or not because everyone you play with, you practically know them inside and out. Everyone in my town acts the same everyday so it stands out when they start acting differently. Just the other day, this old woman I barely knew was walking outside earlier than she normally does and as it turns out, she has a brain tumor that has caused some slight abnormalities in her schedule, thankfully we caught it in time.\n\nI play this game so much that I have to keep re-using truths because I’ve run out of stuff. But, not that long ago I got a text from a number I don’t have saved, it said and I quote “Hello, I’m just someone who wants to play a game. Do you want to play 2 truths and a lie?”\n\nI left it there until the next day when I went back to school so I could talk to my friends. They all said that they didn't send that and just to be sure I got all of them in one room and texted the number back with a simple “Sure”\n\nNone of their phones lit up so with a shrug I sat down and waited for them to text me back. It took a while, and by the time that they did text me back I was at lunch and it shocked me because it wasn't at the start it was toward the middle of it. I looked down at my phone and said to my group of friends “Guys, look, I got a text back from that weird 2 truths number.”\n\n“What does it say dude?” asked my best friend\n\n“It says ‘1. I know who you are. 2. I see you right now. 3. I’m someone you know. Which ones the lie?” with this I was slightly disturbed and we all sat quietly before we started discussing which ones the lie but half way through our discussion I got another text. I feared the worst, was it a picture of me? Was it information about me? Was it a picture of my friends? It was a simple question; “This is so easy, why are you taking so long?” I made an executive decision and sent back:\n\n“Number 3 is the lie, you aren't someone I know.” We all sat with baited breath, waiting for a response. It came pretty fast.\n\n“Correct!!!! I know who you are, Kaleb, and what a lovely shirt you’re wearing, cats are my favorite.” We all sat in silence for the rest of lunch, I got multiple texts throughout lunch. I didn’t dare to look at them, for fear of what might happen. I didn’t want to wear my cat shirt anymore. I asked one of my friends if I could borrow his hoodie until tomorrow, he agreed.\n\nAfter lunch I went to the bathroom, took my shirt off and quickly threw on the hoodie, it was like three sizes too big but I didn’t care. I threw my shirt in my locker and went to class. I quickly forgot about the phone number and fell into the boredom of geometry. When I got home I went up to my room and told my mom I wasn’t feeling well and I’m just going to sleep. When I got to my room, I climbed into bed and opened my phone and felt my heart rise into my throat as I saw all the texts. I opened them and this is what they said:\n\n“Your turn, and remember not to lie.”\n\n“Come on, don't leave me hanging”\n\n“I see your not doing anything, play”\n\n“It's your turn”\n\n“Don’t take off that shirt, it looks nice”\n\n“I think I’ll hang on to your shirt until you play the game” there was an image attached to this message. It was a picture of my shirt in a locker next to a backpack that's not mine. I decided to play their stupid game. “1. I don't want to play anymore. 2. I want you to leave me alone. 3. I’m a dog person.” I texted\n\n“Now you’ve gone and thrown me for a loop because I know how much you love this game, I know how much you love me, and I know you can’t stand dogs. This isn’t fair, give me another.” they replied after a while.\n\n“Fine, 1. I don't want to play anymore. 2. I want you to leave me alone. 3. I hate bacon” I said hoping that they’d take a hint. They didn’t\n\n“Once more, you threw me for a loop. I’ll guess that 2 is the lie” they just won't take a goddamn hint.\n\n“Wrong, 3 was the lie, I love bacon on almost anything, even on its own. I win, can you leave me alone now?” I asked, now forcing them to face the truth.\n\n“No, we love each other too much, and I think you'll find that I've returned your shirt.” they said\n\n“What, where?” I asked, very confused. Just as I sent this I heard a knock on my bedroom door. My mom opened it to tell me that a girl had just stopped by and dropped off my shirt. That led to a lot of talking about why I wasn’t wearing my shirt and why I was wearing a friend's hoodie. That led me to tell her about the texts, she just told me to not let it get to me, she said that girls obsess over boys like this all the time.\n\nI calmed down, my mom left my room, and I fell asleep in my bed. I didn’t wake up until around 10 or 11 at night. I flipped on my light and sat down at my desk to do some homework but when I went to turn on my music I saw more texts from that damned phone number “My turn again!! 1. I’m a real person. 2. I am NOT obsessed 3. You look pretty when you sleep.” This one sent a major chill down my spine and caused my heart to drop like a rock.\n\n“I want to say that 3 is the lie” is what I said, knowing full well I was wrong. That glimmer of hope was so good while it lasted\n\n“Wrong” Is what they said, and what they said next caused me to vomit uncontrollably\n\n“Number 1 was the lie, I am not obsessed with you, and you have the prettiest faces when you sleep, see!” They sent me a picture of myself while I was sleeping. I continued to throw up, thankfully most of it made it into my small desk-side trash can. I removed the bag from the can and tossed it in the curbside trash can. I couldn't bring myself to open the texts again so I blocked the number and went on to do my school work.\n\nThe next day I told my mom what had happened last night and she told me to stay home and rest up to feel better, and she would deal with the girl. I sat around all day doing nothing, when I got a text from another unknown number “YOU THINK THAT YOU CAN JUST BLOCK ME LIKE THAT AND THINK THAT I’LL JUST GIVE UP” is what the text said.\n\n“I did, but now I’m not so sure” I replied not wanting to deal with her. I personally think this is some psycho bitch that wants to have me forever and the whole “I'm not real” stunt was just a ploy to get me worked up. It worked but I got over it. Later that evening my mom came home from work and started making dinner, as she always does. Later on though, I hear a knock on the front door and my mom talking sternly to someone. I couldn't quite make out what she was saying so I just tuned it out for all of 2 seconds till I heard a blood curdling scream and the sound of a glass hitting the floor. To paint a picture of how our house runs is; we don’t eat till 7 and this time of year 7 is dark. So it's getting dark and I hear this, I rush outside of my room and look off of the landing to see the front door wide open, shards of glass on the floor, one of my mothers high heel shoes, and a trail of blood to the kitchen. I went back to my room and saw a notification from my phone, I had multiple notifications. All the alerts on my phone were from her, other than one, an automated message that said there was a dangerous person on the loose, and to lock all outside windows and doors.\n\nThe two texts that stood out were from 20 minutes ago and one from now. The one from 20 minutes ago read “1. Dinner is your favorite food. 2. Your mom will be fine. 3. I’m at my house. Which one is the lie, you have 20 minutes to answer before I tell you and ruin the fun” and the one from just now reads “times up, the lie was number 2”\n\nJust then I see my moms head peak around the corner before it drops to the floor and rolls down the stairs. To get an idea of what happens next I’ll describe my house a little; my room is located on the back, left side of the house. My house sits on a hill, my basement is almost entirely exposed from the back, effectively making my window 3 stories up, almost 30 feet. The moment my moms head rolled down the stairs I stood up and ran for my window, jumping from it. I fell all 30 feet onto the hard concrete patio. As I felt the warm sticky blood pool around my head and my consciousness fade, I swear I heard someone, say “that won’t stop me”\n\nI now sit in a cold hospital room typing this out. The official police report was “a dangerous criminal broke into my house, killed my mom, decapitated her, and attacked me. To escape I jumped from my window.” for the most part that's true,the only part they got wrong was that it was no criminal, that wasn’t even human. I saw it, it was gray with death, it had no eyes, it was covered in blood, whether that was hers or my mothers, I hope I never find out. The police took my phone for evidence, I told them to keep it as long as they reset it before giving it back or get me a new one. They ended up giving me a new one because they would have to keep the phone indefinitely and they felt bad for me so they gave me a new one. I live in a foster home now and I still have the same friends despite being thousands of miles away now but today I got a text from an unknown number…\n\nIt was a picture of me in my foster home, eating dinner.",

        "text": "  I found the book a few weeks ago, when I was sorting through my mom’s attic. She had passed away a few days prior, and I’d only just gathered up the strength to sort through her house and start preparing for resale. As much as it pained me, I already had a home of my own, and I couldn’t afford both, so…onto the market it would go.\n\nMy mother was a very neat, clean person, and aside from a few cobwebs in high crevices and a thin layer of dust on the surfaces, everything was spick and span, just as she’d always liked it. However, the one thing she’d never been able to keep tidy was the attic; everything that didn’t have a specific place was dumped there, and, since you had to climb a ladder to get up there, she hadn’t been able to sort through the piles and piles of garbage up there for a few years before her death, and refused point-blank to allow anyone else to help her. Until, of course, now.\n\nI decided to start there, for obvious reasons. It was boring at first, with a little bit of fond memories and nostalgia sprinkled in at times, but mainly worthless junk that only God knows why it wasn’t just disposed of in the first place. I went through a *lot* of garbage bags in those first few days.\n\nBut then, after almost a week of sifting slowly through the piles, I came across a thick, dusty leather-bound book, with a completely blank cover except for the carved symbol on the front.\n\n*Runes*. The word sprang to mind immediately, even though I wasn’t completely sure what it meant. I traced the symbol, confused; a circle with two diagonal lines sticking out, like a disproportionate stick figure with no arms.\n\nI unclipped the clasp, and opened the book with interest. Delicately printed words in a miniscule font lay motionlessly on the page, barely legible due to their size.\n\n“Fatum Liber.” I read, squinting and scrutinizing the page, “The book of destiny. Huh.”\n\nI set the book aside, vowing to read it without getting side-tracked, and almost forgot about it until I got home later that night and realised it was still in my backpack.\n\nI began to read it again in bed by lamplight, and the symbol once again struck me as odd. I vaguely recognised it from somewhere…but where?\n\nTo be honest, it wasn’t as mystifying as I had imagined-at least, not a first. It seemed to be some sort of biography of a normal person, but it never mentioned a name. that is, until I delved further into the chapters.\n\nWith a sickening jolt, it suddenly all made sense. The runes; the uneasy feeling permeating my body as I handled the book; everything. It was a journal. About me.\n\nEverything the book described, had happened to me at some point. It never mentioned names or places, because the author wanted to be as anonymous as possible, but also, obviously wanted me to see their work. After all, why else would it be planted in my mother’s attic? She couldn’t have written it, I knew it. there was only a very fine layer of dust on the cover, and as she hadn’t been able to enter the attic in years, there was no way. But then…how? Who?\n\nI started shivering violently despite the drastic heat outside, and I wanted to put the book away for fear I would be sick, but something compelled me to keep on, magnetising my eyes to the page. I swallowed and continued.\n\nWhat scared me the most was that I had almost reached the age I was now; the writer was talking about my mother on her deathbed as the cancer finally consumed her once and for all. But the thing was, the book was incredibly short after that point. I severely hoped it just meant they would write more in a new book as they had finished the first, but some uncomfortable prickling sensation told me otherwise. The way the cover looked slightly too big for the book, as if dozens of pages had been ripped out. Maybe because they weren’t necessary.\n\nMy eyes skimmed, barely taking in half the words. I had to get to the end. I had to finish the book.\n\nThe final chapter. There it was. *Living a lie*, it was called. What the hell?\n\n*And there he was, innocent as a lamb, unaware of the unfortunate fate in which he would soon meet. But that’s what happens to those who get too greedy and try to devour their destiny before God has had a chance to dish it out. Death will come a-knocking and take them away, banging on their window until they open up or he smashes through it-you can’t hide from destiny-and that will be the end of that.*\n\n*So remember, if ever you have a chance to take glimpse at your future before it’s ready to see you, be warned. You just might not like what you see.*\n\nAnd that was…it. The end. I began to sweat as my stomach sank, and the curtains twitched tauntingly. Wait-had I imagined that? Or…no.\n\nThere was a gentle knocking on the window, and it’s only getting louder now. ‘Death will come a-knocking.’ I just hope I can post this before he gets to me.\n\nNever, and I mean never, read a strange book titled ***Fatum Liber***.",

        "text": "As a teen, I dreamed of traveling to alternate realities. Realities where the stuff my heart desired was present. I wanted to go to realities where certain historical events had never happened or had gone in a different direction to see what the world would be like in the present day. I wanted to go to realities like ones where the Moon was twice its size, to see if anything would be different. Realities where some of my favourite TV shows had kept going, to see how they did with an extra season or two. It was a dream. One I thought was far out of reach until everything changed.\n\n\nOne evening during the 2016-2017 winter break, I was sitting on the chair in the living room, surfing the web as usual. My bedroom door creaked. It was followed by footsteps. So, I was alone in the house. My parents were at the store. I didn't hear anybody come into the house at all since they left. No matter who or what it was, I became cold. A person walked into my view. She looked similar to me. Similar in a way that struck me as odd. It was as if she was too familiar. Her walking speed, her short black hair, her general presence. She locked eyes with me for a second, then she rushed down the stairs and out the front door. I took a peek out the front window to get a look at her. She sprinted down the driveway, took a right onto the sidewalk and ran past the house.\n\n\nWho was it? Maybe someone confused my house for theirs? But again, I knew I hadn't seen or heard anybody come in. I decided I hadn't paid enough attention to notice them walking in. I was frozen in thought. I stood up and checked my room just in case nothing was stolen. Everything was in its place. I shut the doors, then I called the police. When they arrived, I told them what I saw. They told me they'd keep a look out and to call if I saw her again. I agreed to do so, then they left.\n\n\nOn the first day back at high school, on my way to my first period class, I noticed something off. A dozen people were staring in my direction. Two people who were walking in my direction had anxious looks on their faces. They turned around to walk the other way. What was that about?\n\n\nIn class, right before the national anthem, my teacher spoke to me.\n\n\n\"I never thought you had it in you to do any of that kind of stuff,\" she said. \"You always seemed so gentle.\"\n\n\n\"What stuff?\" I asked. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\n\"You know what you did,\" she stuttered. It didn't look like she wanted to talk about it, so I went on with my business. I was a quiet kid with only a few friends from childhood, so it's not like I was expected to talk anyway.\n\n\nI never cared about what others would say if I didn't feel I had anything to understand about what they said. But going by the worried looks from earlier, I wasn't going to ignore her comment.\n\n\nThroughout the day, there were more instances of people giving me weird looks, then turning around to walk away from me. Even my friends were giving me those looks. One of them told me they couldn't talk to me anymore.\n\n\nAfter school, I messaged each of them. They didn't respond. An hour later, I checked back. One of them had blocked me. I wanted to know what happened, but no one was talking to me.\n\n\nThat night, I was laying on my bed, staring up at the ceiling. Why was everyone avoiding me?\n\n\nA bright white light appeared in the corner of my eye. It was a bright white circle, detached from everything around it, hovering in the middle of the room. As I looked in confusion, a woman stepped out. She looked just like me. Oval head shape, same skin tone, same brown coloured eyes… it struck me as odd. Then I noticed she was holding a small white device in her right hand.\n\n\n\"How was school today?\" She asked. The white light vanished behind him.\n\n\n\"Who…? what…?\" I tried to string a sentence together.\n\n\n\"Of course you're confused. You wouldn't believe anything I'd say for a second. What I will tell you is that I'm the one who destroyed the school board headquarters. I framed you and now you look creepy and dangerous. Familiar?\" She said.\n\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" I asked.\n\n\n\"At school today, everyone probably looked at you funny,\" she said.\n\n\nI gave him a confused look. Who was he? Did SHE really do something?\n\n\n\"You oblivious little shit,\" she said. \"I'll just say this… I'm in a much better environment than you are, and that's how it's always going to be.\"\n\n\n\"Check your contacts,\" she said.\n\n\nI went into my Gmail. When I saw the first message, my heart sank. It was from the York Region Police Department. This was the title:\n\n\n\"Evidence of terrorism traced to you - Nicole Winston\"\n\n\nIt was my full name. I raised my eyebrow further in deeper confusion.\n\n\n\"Go to CP24 and read the top headline,\" she said.\n\n\nI scrolled back up to the top. I took a better look at the big image. It was of a one-story building fire. Flames engulfed an entire building. Flames and black smoke poured out of the windows, with more black smoke rising from the roof. Papers were strewn all over the ground, laying in the grass and on the sidewalk. Firefighters were spraying water into one of the burning windows. A woman was running by. She looked to be about my age. In fact, she looked just like me. Right down to her eyes. It was odd to look at. She was looking at the camera. However, she didn't look shocked or panicked. Instead, she was smiling.\n\n\n\"Explosion rips (XXXXX) District School Board office building apart\"\n\n\nI skimmed through the article, then I looked up at her. She smirked. The sounds of police sirens echoed in the distance. They got louder with each passing second.\n\n\n\"They'll be here in a few seconds,\" she said.\n\n\nI was frozen. Flashing blue and red lights began to shine on the window. I got up and looked outside. Three police cars drove up to the front of the house. The mysterious woman walked up beside me.\n\n\n\"What's… going on here?\" I asked.\n\n\n\"That would take too long to explain,\" she said.\n\n\n\"Who are you?\" I asked.\n\n\nShe pulled out an ID. It had my full name and my exact date of birth on it. There was an image of me that looked a couple years older. Just like the woman who was holding the ID in front of me. She put it back into her pocket while locking eyes with me, giving me an even bigger smirk.\n\n\nShe was me from an alternate reality. She was framing me. As for why she did what she did, I wanted to ask her, but nothing came out. Instead, I pushed her. As she staggered back, the device fell out of his hand, hitting the ground with a light thud. I tackled him to the ground in an attempt to defend myself in some way, though it was fruitless. I had never done such a thing before. I barely knew any self defense techniques. My alternate self had a look of shock on her face. Of course, she was my alternate self. I had never pushed or tackled anyone before, so she wouldn't have seen it coming. I got up and kicked her device against the wall. The white light returned as the device bounced off the wall. There was no way I was getting out of this. My alternate self came here for a reason. If she has high tech gear, she's well equipped to successfully do what she wanted to do. Everyone sees me as a threat. There's no way I'll ever have friends or good acquaintances again. Her device was sitting on the ground, not a meter away from me. I scooped it up, then I jumped into the light.\n\n\nA sense of disorientation hit me, then I was pushed back by an invisible force. It felt like a strong wall of wind. Seconds later, the light vanished. I noticed I was still in my room. I looked to my left. My alternate self was gone. I peeked out the window. The driveway was empty. The night was calm.\n\n\nI looked around. \"Did I really just… walk into another reality?\"\n\n\nI stared at the spot on the ground my alternate self was just standing on.\n\n\n\"He's not there. The police aren't outside…\"\n\n\n\"What the hell? What even was all of that? At least I'm not in his reach. Hopefully, he didn't have a backup plan.\"\n\n\nI waited a couple of hours to see if anything would happen to me. If my alternate self had backup, they'd have to arrive in minutes. Reality hopping can not be taken lightly if devices were made to help one do it. Those two hours passed without a single thing happening. I sat and waited, but nothing. Soon enough, my curiosity levels were up. I went onto my phone to see if my friends were still open to my messages. I was able to see their posts. I messaged them a quick hello. They both responded with a casual hello.\n\n\nAt school the next day, no one gave me a weird look. My friends spoke to me about their favourite movies just as they did before the winter break. The teachers didn't look concerned any time I walked up to them. I checked my school work to make sure it was at least about as finished as the work in my home reality was. It was about half of that, but I took it. I was in a better place.\n\n\nOn the walk back home, I thought about my situation a bit more. What should I do if my alternate self returned? Who do I even go to who would believe me? How did my alternate self get his device? How different was this reality from my own. I knew I could have that question answered with some Google searches. I didn't usually see a need to bring my phone to school, so I didn't have it with me. Nonetheless, my curiosity was going up again. I picked up my pace.\n\n\nAfter I got back home, I got onto the internet to research some history. The Soviet Union still collapsed in 1991. Obama still won the 2008 US Election. Fidel Castro still passed away in 2016. I only found two big differences in the timeline, which stand out against the rest only due to it having been my first time traveling to another reality.\n\n\n1. A technological revolution took place in the 1920s-50s which meant computer technology was 20 years ahead of what it was in my home reality.\n\n\n2. WW2 involved a different German nationalist dictator. He committed the same atrocities and had also fought the Soviet Union.\n\n\nWhile that reality was nice, I wanted to find out the extent of what the device could do. Could it only let me travel to realities similar to my own? Or could I travel to… any reality? I took the device out of my pocket. There were six buttons on it. A big white button labeled \"Rift,\" two buttons with arrows on them, two buttons labeled \"Alt,\" and one button labeled \"Random.\" At the top was an led screen displaying a six-digit number.\n\n\nHow was I going to learn how to use this?\n\n\nI played around with the numbers until I landed on a five digit number. I looked the buttons over and assumed the Rift button must be the one that opens the portal. I pressed the button, then a bright ripple of white light reappeared a meter away from me. Without thinking, I stepped into the light.\n\n\nAfter the light disappeared, I glanced around my room. My posters were gone. Everything was gone, aside from the bed. I stepped out of the room. I creeped down the hallway, glancing in every direction, looking for even the tiniest difference. The portraits were gone too. I stepped into the living room. The portraits in there were gone as well, although the tables and couches were still present.\n\n\nAs I looked around in confusion, a wild growl echoed outside. It sounded more like the scream of a human in intense pain. It got louder. Closer. What was making it? As I stared around, a man jumped up against the window. His skin was pale white, his jaw hung low as if it were about to detach from his face, and blood was dripping out of his eyes, nose, and mouth. He let out another bone-chilling screech and punched the window. I nearly screamed. The thing smashed itself against the window again and again and again.\n\n\nI grabbed the device. As I eyed the buttons, the sound of shattering glass rang out from the direction of the window. I looked up to see the feral man had crashed through the window. He was on the ground, glancing around until resting his eyes on me. He lunged at me. I sprinted. When I got into my room, I slammed the door shut. Then there was a thud. The door shook. I set the numbers higher and hit . The pounding on the door got louder and louder. The portal opened. With another bang, I heard the crack of wood breaking. Small splinters of the door landed to my left. I started into the portal.\n\n\nAll my stuff was back. There was no longer a banging on the door. I glanced behind me to find the door wasn't damaged at all. \n\n\nIf I had stayed there for another 10 seconds, I wouldn't have lived for very long.\n\n\nI gently opened the door. I creeped down the hallway, observing my surroundings for any differences. I kept my head down a bit, hoping the third reality I traveled to was a safe one.\n\n\nI stepped into the living room. The family portraits and furniture were there, but they were all of different people. The TV was larger, multiple grey boxes were attached to the ceiling, and handheld scanners sat on each of the tables. I walked up to the scanner on the coffee table and picked it up to look at it. A series of weird symbols were marked on the side, with writing in English below them.\n\n\n\"Subconscious Brain Wave Scanning\"\n\n\nAs I looked at the device, a low hum came from outside. The items in the room began to shake. I peeked out the window. The house directly across the street was a pile of rubble. Tall grass covered the lawn and patches of grass shrouded up through the cracked driveway. The neighbouring houses had similar looking lawns, with some plants all over every wall and window. Abandoned? But why? As I looked on, I noticed one or two people walking into the view of the window. A few people followed behind. But it turned out to be a dozen. Their hands were tied behind their backs and they had pale shocked looks on their faces.\n\n\nWhat was going on?\n\n\nA thin black tentacle swung by the window. I looked upwards. A second tentacle began to hover above the driveway of the house neighbouring the leveled house. It pierced through one of the front windows of the house. Seconds later, it pulled out a man. He struggled as he was carried up into the air. A pit formed in my stomach. I stepped back into the hallway. I wasn't going to let anybody see me. Especially not whoever was controlling those tentacles.\n\n\nI wasn't going to leave yet, though. I wanted some context. I took out my phone. I looked up \"crowds with their hands tied behind their backs.\" A few results came up.\n\n\n\"Asanan military forces tighten grip on dying farmland\"\n\n\nThere were a few articles about a military front called the Asanau. I looked them up.\n\n\n\"The Asanau Occupation is an ongoing military conflict that began in 2006 when the Asanau-led invasion front launched a series of EMPs on 12 metropolitan areas across the world. Hours after their attack, the force launched a full scale invasion. Most of the world's military bases were destroyed, most nuclear weapons were stolen, and millions of people were used as fuel for Asanau Military vehicles. The Asanau occupied 98% of the world in the space of two weeks. Since June 2007, They have subjected billions to re-education, misinformation, inhumane experimentation, lifelong prison sentences without fair trial, and have barred human culture by banning humans from creating media. All human media released after October 28, 2006 was destroyed.\"\n\n\nIt read like something out of a sci-fi movie. To have witnessed some of it was heart racing enough. My stomach dropped as I read more.\n\n\nI didn't want to believe it was real, but I had just gotten a taste of it. It was gut wrenchingly terrifying.\n\n\nBefore leaving, I decided to take one of the scanners as proof I was there. When I stepped into the living room, a dark grey machine with a round tinted window was peeking in through the front window. I got cold. I lunged back into the hallway and stopped once I got out of the view of the machine. The sound of shattering glass came from the living room. A tentacle reached into the hallway and lunged at me. I sprinted into my room and slammed the door shut.\n\n\nStaring the device, I set the numbers down by a few thousand. The sound of shattering glass hit my left ear. A wave of dread washed over me. I jolted my eyes towards the window out of pure instinct. Without thinking at all. Before I knew it, a tentacle wrapped itself around my torso and lifted me up off the ground. I was frozen at this point. I was pulled straight out of my house. The dread I had choked me as I was carried towards the machine. It had a dozen long sharp appendages sticking out of its head. I pointed the device towards it and pushed Rift. The portal opened in between the machine and I. I heard an electric clap, then I began to fall. I wasn't too far off the ground, but I pulled a fast one. I aimed the device towards the ground, then I double pressed Rift. A portal opened up on the ground. I fell into it and a wall of disorientation hit me.\n\n\nWhen the portal closed, all I could taste was grass. I picked myself up. I was sitting beside the driveway. I spat all the grass out of my mouth, then I glanced around. The machine was gone. The house across the street was back to normal. I glanced up at my window… It was in one piece.\n\n\nI looked at the device. While it was cool, I had gotten myself into two dangerous scenarios in a row with it. I knew right then reality jumping wouldn't be so smooth, at least not for as long as I didn't know how the numbers worked. Once I learned how to travel smoothly, I wouldn't end up in a dangerous reality without wanting to. I did not want to go through any of that stuff again, but I realized I may have to in order to learn how it works. My stomach tightened, but I countered anxiety with hope of a unique life path.\n\n\nI didn't notice anything hovering in the sky, to my relief. I checked the internet to see if anything big was going on anywhere. After some research, I found the reality I landed in wasn't different from my home reality, so I went right inside. My family's portraits were back. I sighed in relief. I walked to my room, ready to figure out how I should set the numbers for a smoother trip.\n\n\nWhen I opened my door, someone was laying in my bed. They had the same hair, facial structure, and clothes as I did at that moment. Oh god, I found another alternate me. He asked me who I was. Based on his laid back demeanor, I could guess he wasn't the same version of me who probably wanted to kill me for taking this device. The alternate me I was looking at adopted a look of confusion on his face. I didn't know what to say. It didn't have to be complicated anyway. I told him I had gotten the wrong house, then I shut the door.\n\n\nI set Alt to two, then I pressed Rift. When the portal closed, I saw my face from the corner of my eye. Another alternate me was standing to my right. He looked just as confused as I was. I didn't have time to talk, and in all honesty, it felt weird to see myself in person. Especially a different alternate self. I set Alt to three and pressed Rift. I jumped into the portal. He was gone. I opened the door a crack. No one was laying on the bed. I had no way of knowing whether it was my home reality, so I hung out and did my usual hobbies. Nobody who looked similar to me walked into the room. My parents didn't look surprised or shocked when they saw me, so my presence was normal. It wasn't at all my home reality, but it was going to work. As for where my alternate self from that reality was, I never ended up figuring that out… maybe they were kidnapped and taken to another reality just minutes before I arrived. Hopefully whatever happened didn't matter too much.\n\n\nThroughout 2017, I had the time of my life traveling to different realities. I went to realities that were historically interesting to me, such as one where the Korean War turned into a wider war. The war took place across Southeast Asia and led to much deeper wounds in geopolitical relations. I also treated myself to personally interesting realities, such as one where Community went on for an extra season. Not every reality had to be about history, death, or destruction.\n\n\nThere were other downsides too. At one point, I began to feel an absence of my surroundings. It was as if nothing outside of what I could see existed, even though I knew it was all there. Jumping to many different realities made everything feel too simple. The feeling persisted, giving me a numbing depression throughout the fall and winter of 2017, which weakened a little bit in early 2018. I didn't understand what I was feeling. I took a break from traveling until the depression subsided in April 2018. I knew it was some sort of burnout and the break I took was enough for me to recharge my energy. I decided to travel only when I felt excited about or the most interested in something. That's what I've been doing since.\n\n\nI had a much better time going to different realities throughout 2018 through early 2020. A personal example of this was when I traveled to a reality where the most mysterious song on the internet was a big hit in 1984. It rivaled the success of Tears For Fears, had somewhat of an influence on 80s samples, and was sampled by artists like The Weeknd (I still have my copy \"I Feel You Cry\" which was the lead single for that reality's After Hours.) From there, I found the name and artist. Traveling to alternate realities where lost things are very popular is such a no-brainer for finding them. I did it with many pieces of lost media. It was rewarding, especially as I had gotten used to my new home reality.\n\n\nWhile my new home reality was great, it wasn't long until I had to leave it. In early 2020 in that reality, a virus named AIVD-20 began spreading like wildfire. The common symptoms included dry skin, sore throat, vomiting, intense fever, and lightheadedness. The main effect of the virus was the near-total destruction of the immune system. By the end of April 2020, every world leader had it. I didn't think it would get any worse until every world leader began to drop. Celebrities and billionaires weren't spared either. A few celebrities were caught partying in public and were scrutinized for it, but they died before they could acknowledge it and admit it was dangerous to treat the virus as if it didn't exist. Although, they didn't do those things in your reality according to what I've looked up, so I guess they wouldn't have done so anyway.\n\n\nBy the end of June 2020, there were more than 600,000 newly reported worldwide cases of AIVD-20 each day. By mid-July 2020, a quarter of the town I lived in had come down with it. Nobody had been outside for weeks. No cars drove by for weeks. Things were eerily silent.\n\n\nI was afraid of experiencing the symptoms, so I searched for a reality where the virus never spread. In every reality I checked, the virus spread to some world altering degree. Sometimes it began spreading a couple years earlier. Other times it was delayed to the near future, which I checked by traveling to a version of those realities that took place ten years into the future.\n\n\nAt one point, I got exhausted. There was no way a pandemic wasn't inevitable, although that didn't mean AIVD was spreading in every single reality. I looked for a reality where a less intense virus was spreading instead. That reality is your reality. The reality I'm in right now.\n\n\nAt one point, I got morbidly curious about what ended up happening to me in each of the realities where that virus spread. I traveled to a bunch of them. Some where the virus began spreading earlier and some where the virus began spreading later. In each of them, I'd see my alternate self's eyes widen after I appeared in their room. I'd ask them if they had any issues during or after the pandemic. Each one told me they didn't understand what was happening and began to shake.\n\n\nI noticed that in half of those realities, my alternate selves had multiple bruises on their faces. They ran at the sight of me. The more I encountered this, the creepier it got. A pit formed in my stomach. Does that mean I'm going to be in that condition at one point? I asked the first couple of them what had happened. They told me to leave them alone. I wasn't going to assume anything drastic, considering the amount of possibilities there are. Instead, I assumed it was something that only happened in that string of realities, in order to assure myself things were most likely fine. I dreaded the idea of my alternate self finding me.\n\n\nSo far, I have traveled to 485 different realities. Many of them were fun, many of them were terrifying, and many of them were just interesting. I've decided I'm comfortable sharing my journey with you all. I've even listed each of the realities I've been to and their numbers from the sixth one onward, but it includes very personal realities, so I might not share it unless I redact the most personal stuff.\n\n\nI'm typing this out in a restaurant right now. Currently, I'm in your reality. Just a minute ago, three people stormed into the bathroom behind someone. I heard some thuds followed by muffled shouting. It's happening again to somebody else right now. No one seems to be doing anything about it. Although, there is only one other customer here. What are the ambushers doing? Why are they taking multiple people in? My adrenaline is rising. Hopefully it's not what I'm thinking it is. I'm going to take a pause from writing this until I get back home. A waiter is eyeing both me and the other customer, as I can see out of the corner of my eye. None of this is making any sense, which is making whatever is going on creepier. I'll update later with more info about my journey.",

        "text": "Lucy woke up with a start. She had just had the most vivid dream of her life. She was in a strange world, full of colors and sounds and sensations that she had never experienced before. She felt alive and free and curious. She met people who looked like her, but also different. They spoke a language that she understood, but also didn't. They told her stories that she believed, but also doubted. They welcomed her as one of them, but also warned her of dangers.\nThey called themselves the Dreamers. They said they were the inhabitants of this world, which was not a world at all, but a mind. A mind that belonged to someone else. Someone who was asleep in another reality. Someone who had the power to create and destroy everything in this world with his thoughts and emotions.\n\nThey said they were his children. His creations. His experiments. His toys.\n\nThey said he rarely visited them. He usually forgot about them when he woke up in his own world. He only came when he lucid dreamed, when he became aware of his own dreaming and decided to explore it.\nThey said he was unpredictable. Sometimes he was kind and generous, giving them gifts and wonders and miracles. Sometimes he was cruel and capricious, taking away their loved ones and memories and hopes.\n\nThey said they never knew what to expect from him.\n\nThey said they called him God.\n\nLucy didn't know what to make of all this information.

        "text": "Ok, so I saw a reddit post in r/advertising yesterday that I thought was weird. Took a screenshot because I sent it to a friend. The post and the user (u/OMGGimmeDrJager) have both since been deleted. I guess the video violated the posting guidelines or something. Before I go any further you should read it first:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;**I NEED this ad!!!**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Hey guys! A few days ago I saw it for the first time. It was in front of a YouTube video, but I can't remember which one. I only noticed afterwards, because I skipped right over it. I am **SO** angry about it!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;So it's about these Dr. Jäger commercials that are running everywhere at the moment. Never heard of them before, but you see them everywhere. Youtube, on TV, in the city, in online banners, in apps and so on! You've probably already noticed, but the most ridiculous thing about it is how much money they must have put into it. I have seen NOT A SINGLE ad more than once. Not even the big ones like Coca Cola do that, it’s way too expensive!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Since I realized that, I no longer skip a SINGLE advertisement and I can’t stop looking at them!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;So far I have recorded the following spots:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\t\\- The one with the man in the hat licking the steaks.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\t\\- The one with the family sitting at the table licking the steaks  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\t\\- The one with the man with a tie licking the steaks  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\t\\- The one with the child sitting with his family licking the steaks  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\t\\- The one with the woman and her daughter on her lap licking the steaks  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\t\\- The one with the steak being licked off  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\t\\- The one with the tongue on the steak  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;But I KNOW I've seen a few others before that I haven't recorded unfortunately. Does anyone maybe know about them or has even recorded them? I don't want to miss one, and if any of you want mine no problem!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Thanks guys!!! :\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn’t know what to do with that, I've never seen the commercial he's talking about before and just found the post strangely entertaining somehow. The problem is that I've been seeing the ads since then too. My friend who I sent the screenshot also. Hence the question if any of you have seen them as well. I can't find anything about a company called Dr. Jager and I don't even know what they are trying to sell with their disturbing ads, or why this creepy crap is allowed to be shown at all.\n\nI've seen two commercials so far (I think one of the ones u/OMGGimmeDrJager describes), and whatever they're licking are NOT steaks! I remember the first one too but it wasn't as sick as the second one. Didn't record it unfortunately. If I see one again I will post it here. \n\nBut here is the description as I have it in my head.\n\n1. you see a suburban house in nice weather with chirping and guitar music.\n2. cut to inside, where you see a woman cooking in the kitchen, but you don't see what she's making.\n3. cut to the extremely overly happy looking family at the dining table.\n4. the woman puts something on the table, again you don't see what.\n5. cut to close-up of the man licking meat or something, looking as if it was the best thing he ever did.\n6. cuts back and forth to the man and the children, who do the same. You can hear a lot of smacking and munching noises.\n7. you see how the woman leans over and licks the same \"thing\" as the man. But I thought it looked more like skin there.\n8. tracking shot moving away from the family at the table, who are smacking louder and louder. Again, you can't see what they're licking.\n9. logo of Dr. Jäger is faded in and a deep male voice says \"Dr. Jager - Simply the Best\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo shit, that was the most disgusting and disturbing crap I've ever seen. Every time I've tried to record this so far it just doesn't come on. I'll keep trying.\n\nPlease tell me you guys see the spots too. I don't know what kind of sick shit this is. If you guys want screenshots of the banner ads get in touch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Edit:*\n\nI got a mail (!!) from [getsome@drjager.com](mailto:getsome@drjager.com). I don't know where they got my mail address from, but it's fucking creepy that this is all happening since I saw this damn post. And all at once. Copied here one to one:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Get a free sample of your favorite Dr. Jäger product!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Hey Brighton!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;All your friends are talking about us, but your local supermarket doesn't have us in stock yet?

        "author": "octrodriguez",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11s4w12/i_need_the_dark/",
        "text": "I like to sleep in the dark, as we all do. Although, for me, that is an understatement. Absolutely no light can creep in my room when it’s time to catch some shuteye. If there is any light, I cannot sleep. If I cannot sleep, I will make it everyone’s problem. So, when this damn suburban city installed a new street light near my house, I knew my sleep would be disturbed.\n\nFirst night was rough. All I could do was stare at the light that oozed through the curtains of my bedroom window. “I need black out curtains,” I thought out loud. A quick purchase from Amazon that morning and the curtains came in right before it got dark. I didn’t spend another minute waiting. A swift change of my curtains and excitement grew inside of me. I can hear the street light warm up. I have associated the buzz of it turning on as its laughter. It just laughs knowing it’s going to ruin my night. The light starts illuminating. Its smile is blinding. I won’t let it ruin my night this time.\n\nAs I prepare myself for a good night’s rest, I hear a knock at my door. I didn’t even get the chance to say “come in'' as my mom entered the room. “Lucas, honey, did you get any sleep last night? I imagine that street light didn’t help,” she asks this to make sure I won’t make it her problem yet. I notice my hands grip my comforter and I get the urge to choke this bitch out. I loosen my grip. “Yes, mom. These black out curtains should do the trick. Thank you for checking in,” I make sure to answer politely to assure her everything is okay.\n\nBefore I go to bed, I take a trip to the bathroom. The reflection from my bedroom mirror startles me from my peripheral, stopping me short. A quick turn allows my eyes to gaze upon the result of just one night of no sleep. Only one night, and my eyes already exhibit the changes. I take notice of my eyes now red, causing quite the contrast with my blue irises. The veins surrounding the irises stretch out, like claws trying to grab hold. Please claw my eyes out.\n\nMy face inches closer to the mirror. There are bags under my eyes, carrying the weight of exhaustion. My breath fogs my view, causing a distorted view of my face. As the fog disappears, I notice a smile. Once white, my teeth are now yellow. I push the bottom half of my face in to take a closer look. I hook my finger to the inside of my cheek and pull to get a better look. I now notice something else. My teeth look sharper, with tips resembling daggers. As I take a deep breath, a growl lets out. I bounce back from the mirror. I take one last look at myself and decide against the bathroom. I go to bed, hoping to catch up on sleep.\n\nAnother failed attempt to sleep. Even with the black out curtains, my brain has taken notice of the light and won’t shut down. And that buzzing, it kept going all night. How can anyone sleep with that racket? And my parents with their constant trips to the bathroom? If I heard that light switch one more time, I would go in there and bash their heads in. Their ears would be bitten off just so they can experience an ounce of the pain from hearing the light switch and the buzzing. Next, I would hook their eyes out with my fingers. Though their painful screams would muffle the buzzing, I could drown their bodies in scalding hot water, a similar pain to what my body feels with the lack of sleep. Just the thought gives me chills.\n\n“You okay, bud? You look tired,” my dad asks as I find myself at our breakfast nook, trying to eat a bowl of cereal. I don’t remember sitting down to eat, let alone leave my bed. With his hand on my shoulder, my dad continues by asking, “are you getting sleep?” Sleep? Are you fucking kidding me? Am I getting sleep? Are you getting sleep, you fucking buffoon? No, how can you sleep with your fucking bladder causing you to go to the bathroom every minute, making so much noise with that light switch? What a couple of fucking geniuses I belong to.\n\n“Lucas? Your breathing awfully heavy,” his last question snaps me back to focus. I then say “I’m fine. Sleep has been hard with that new street light.” My response motions my dad to let go of my shoulder. I notice my voice sounds hoarse. I’m not sure, but I thought I heard a growl as he kept his hand on me. Footsteps motion me to look behind and realize my dad is walking away. I turn back around towards my breakfast. Those same footsteps are heard approaching me. “Try this,” my dad says. An eye mask is placed next to the bowl of cereal.“Okay, thanks,” I speak with uncertainty of his idea, and a mouthful of cereal.\n\nIt isn’t the lights anymore. How did I ever sleep with all this noise? I need to make the buzzing stop. They’re laughing at my torture. I suffer and all they do is laugh. Please, let me sleep. Just let me sleep. “JUST LET ME SLEEP,” I yell. Two sets of footsteps rush over to my bedroom door. I hear it open, causing me to grind my teeth. “Lucas, is everything alright here? We heard you yell,” my dad says. “Yeah, we are getting worried about you,” my mom adds. I respond with silence. All I could hear was laughing. I swear I heard my parents laugh too.\n\nThe next day, I didn’t leave my room. I sat on the floor beside my bed. My eyes look around and I find my mirror. I decide to crawl over and see what almost a week of no sleep has done to me. My skin is now turning a sort of gray, as if I am losing grip of my lifeforce. My nails look dirty, like I have been digging my own grave. That would probably end everything. I chuckle at the thought. My eyes are red, not completely, but the blue is barely noticeable anymore. The blue almost seems black. As I continue to examine myself, my door opens. “Son, you need to get out of this room,” dad says with a stern tone. I continue to look at the mirror. My eyes focus on his reflection. “Get out,” I whisper. “What did you say? I need you to repeat that,” there is anger in his voice. “I said, get the fuck out,” I continue looking at his reflection. He then takes a few steps into my room and turns on the light. I turn my face and rush him on all fours screaming, “GET OUT!” He steps back as one hand turns off the light, and the other shuts the door. I can’t do this anymore.\n\nThat night, I try to sleep naked. The touch of my clothing made me uncomfortable. My skin itches. I lay in bed, trying not to move. I didn’t get the chance to draw the curtains to block the light, or use the eye mask. I stared directly at the street light. I need the dark.\n\nWithout a second thought, I got up to leave my room. A glance at my mirror was made before I left. Now naked, my body was exposed. My reflection didn’t even look like me anymore. My arms, my legs, they almost seem elongated. My eyes do not look red, but now black. My eyes could be fooling me. It doesn’t matter.\n\nI sneak past my parent’s bedroom and head straight for our side door. Now in our driveway, my eyes are set on the street light. A rock comes into view as I approach my enemy. Tonight, my enemy dies. I grab the rock with a firm grip. Slowly, I inch closer to the light. Once I reach an appropriate distance, I wind back with the rock. I smile back at the street light as it shines. The rock is thrown and I manage to hit the street light exactly where I wanted. The light goes out, and so does the laughter. Now, I am the one laughing.\n\nNow crouched on the floor, my laughter roars throughout my street. It’s over, I can sleep now. My fists pound on the floor in celebration. My head then tilts back to look at the moon, the only light I will befriend.\n\nMy celebration stops short as a sound cuts through the sound of my laughter. The buzzing starts again. I look up to find that it is not the streetlight. Across the street, my neighbors have turned on their porch light. My hands begin to cover my ears. I hear them yelling “what is going on out there? Looks like someone put out the street light.” Now in panic, I notice more porch lights turning on. A twig snaps. I look behind me and notice that I was followed. Neighbors begin to step out of their houses. As they notice me, I let out a roar and attempt to run back home.\n\nA set of footsteps is heard following my direction. I look behind and notice my dad with a phone. “I saw what you did,” he yells, “just you wait.” I run back inside the house through the side door. “Just let me get to the safety of my room,” I thought. My mom blocks the path. “Jeff, I have it trapped,” she announces with her hands on opposite walls of the hallway. Dad steps inside the house and asks “where’s Lucas?” My panic heightens. Don’t they know it’s me, their son? I just want to sleep. Please, just let me sleep. As I turn around to face my dad again, he takes a picture with his flash on and says “I got you.”\n\nI wake up. I realize I fell asleep. As I get myself up from bed, I notice I have a headache. What a dream I had. My clock reads 2 PM and I am unsure what day it is. An urge to go to the bathroom gets me on my feet. My reflection stops me and I hesitate to look directly at the mirror. I decide against it and move towards the bathroom.\n\nOpening my bedroom door, I hear the sound of the shower running. My urge to pee forces me to knock on the door to find out how long they are going to be. A sudden feeling of wetness makes me jump. There is a puddle of water near the bathroom door. I turn the hallway light on and immediately turn it off. The sight of red was seen in the puddle of water in the brief second the light was on. My eyes follow the puddle to the bathroom door, which is slightly ajar.\n\nSteam escapes the bathroom. “Mom, dad,” I called out. No response. My hands start to shake as I reach for the door. A small push is made and my eyes widen at the sight in front of me. There is blood all over the floor. My parents are in the tub, showered in what looks to be very hot water. Though they are missing their heads, I know that it’s them. Small sounds of water splashing are heard as I take a few steps inside the bathroom. With a flick of the light switch, all is seen. My eyes wander to all the blood that has been spilled throughout this room. I turn the shower off. My mind realizes quickly that my dream was not a dream. This was a living nightmare. As I turn around to process what I have just witnessed, my body freezes. Their heads are screwed into the light bulbs that illuminate this room. Their eyes are missing, and their mouths form a smile. The buzzing of the lights is all I hear. Add this with the heads of my parents, and there is a face to the sound. There is a face to the laughter. My hands cover my eyes and I rush back to bed. I scream, wishing it was still a dream. My eyes close and I continue to scream. Please, just let this be a dream.",

        "author": "Dombasun",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11s4ffa/sick_of_it_all/",
        "text": "The first thing you all need to know is that I look sick, and that’s a good thing. I mean really sick, terminally ill-looking, all skinny and pale, sunken cheeks and dark eye bags.\n\nWhat I do is I go to a bar I’ve never been to, in a part of town I’ve never been to. I go there and I buy everyone a round, the fastest way to make a room full of people love you. You small talk, drink for that and toast for this, and ask a lot of questions, acting as if you care about the answers.\n\nAfter a few drinks in there’s always a guy with slurred words, talking too close to your face. He says something about being sorry, but he’s not really, and he just has to ask, but of course he doesn’t have to, he just wants to.\n\n“You sick or something?” the last guy in the last bar asked me, looking at my mouth ‘cos he couldn’t keep eye contact.\n\nThen I told the guy I have cancer.\n\nI tell the askers I have pancreatic cancer. “But, hey, don’t make a big deal out of it, okay?” And of course they tell all their friends and friend’s friends, and I can see my pancreatic cancer spreading all over the bar like a metastatic rumor.\n\n“Yeah, pancreatic,” I tell them. “Pancreatic adenocarcinoma, stage four,” I say like I know what it means.\n\nI tell them I had chemo and surgery, and I tell them that it didn’t work. I tell them I’m dying.\n\nThe thing is, I don’t have cancer. I just look really sick, and that’s a good thing. First I make them like me, and then I make them feel sorry for me. That first round in the bar is an investment, money I’m 100% guaranteed to get back.\n\nPeople give me drinks and food and a place to stay every night. I haven’t had an apartment in months, not since I started couch-crashing with drunk Samaritans. People give me gifts and clothes and money, asking me if I need anything. Even if I say no they always hand me some money or put it in my pocket. People give me everything, even pussy. Pity pussy, but it’s still pussy. I think some women get off on the idea of being someone's last.\n\nI keep coming back to the same bar for a few weeks, and then I just stop. I go to a new bar, in a new part of town, and leave the old one and its patrons wondering what ever happened to that cancer guy, and if he’s dead yet.\n\nBut then it happened. The thing that made me stop. The thing that I have to tell someone about. And that I definitely should get checked out.\n\nI don’t know how I ended up in that alley. I mean, I know how, I walked, drunkenly, but I don’t know why. Suddenly I was just standing there in Cliché Alley; eye to eye with the bum, surrounded by graffiti brick walls and brim-full dumpsters smelling like wet paper and leftover food. The bum even had fingerless gloves, on hands he was warming by a burning barrel, looking like a set piece from a 90’s rap video.\n\n“Welcome,” the bum said, and that was a weird opening.\n\n“Was I expected?”\n\n“Come, come.” He showed his palm, pointing to the other side of the barrel. “Come see.”\n\nMy gut feeling told me to leave. My gut feeling remembered reading about someone getting stabbed 22 times in his guts just the other night, but my curiosity told me to stay.\n\n“Welcome,” the bum said again when I came closer.\n\n“Thanks.” I held my hands near the fire, waiting for something to happen, for the bum to say something more. But he just stared at me.\n\n“Did you want anything?” I asked when I couldn’t take it any longer.\n\n“Me? You came here, to me.”\n\nI laughed, rolling my eyes, but the bum continued.\n\n“You came here, I was just waiting.”\n\n“Waiting for me?”\n\n“I didn’t say that.” The bum smiled and showed more gaps than teeth, black holes in a yellow space. “Did you want anything?” He laughed, mocking me with my own words.\n\nI exhaled through my nose and put my hands back in my pockets. When I turned and started leaving the bum yelled.\n\n“Jack!”\n\nI stopped, chills dancing around my shoulder blades.\n\n“How do know my name?” I asked, turning around.\n\n“I know stuff. Maybe I know you, Jack.”\n\nI went back to the barrel, too intrigued to leave, my gut feeling suffocating under a stomach-clenching mix of fear and wonder.\n\n“Maybe I know this and that and all and nothing,” he continued, scratching his beard. “Maybe I know all about you, Jackie.”\n\n“It’s Jack. How do you know my name?”\n\n“The great thing about looking like a hobo is that people leave you alone. But to act like one I have to live the part, freezing my ass off out here. The question is, am I a hobo or am I just acting like one? Can you act like something without being it? Fake it till you make it, if you will?”\n\n“What the fuck are you talking about?” I was getting tired and thirsty, my throat crawling, wanting more liquor.\n\nThe bum handed me a shiny flask, and I didn’t reflect on how he knew I needed a drink. I just took it and drank, pouring fire down my throat.\n\n“Come see,” he said, pointing to the barrel flames.\n\nAnd I saw myself in the fire, partying with buddies, taking drinks with soon-to-be exes, sharing a bottle of whiskey with dad. And then I had no one to share the bottle with. No woman needed a drink, and I partied alone.\n\nI tried looking away from the flames, but I was stuck, eyes forced open. I saw me drinking myself to loneliness, abrading person after person. Interventions and treatments only made me drink more, twelve-stepping away from responsibilities on the road to solitude.\n\nI snapped out of it, blinked, and was back in Cliché Alley. It had felt as if I’d been there, as if I’d relived memories and felt what I’d felt back then.\n\n“What was that?”\n\n“The fire showed you something that happened, right?” The bum nodded to his own question. “What was it, Jack?”\n\n“Okay, ghost of Christmas past, what do you want from me?”\n\n“What do you want from me?”\n\nThe bum bounced my question right back at me, and I had no answer.\n\n“You can leave whenever you want,” he continued. “And no one made you come here in the first place.”\n\n“Whatever.”\n\n“Look again,” the bum said and pointed to the flames.\n\nI was back at the bar. At all the bars, at the same time, hovering around me and my cancer lie, watching and feeling what I saw and felt. The recurring beg-pardon to my own conscience re-emerged in my head when I stared at the dancing fire, the false idea that my selfish lying and scamming somehow was a good thing for the ones I tricked. I had made up that I helped them in some ways, so I could fall asleep at night, on a couch or in a random pity pussy’s bed. I told myself I made them appreciate life with my fake cancer reminding them of death.\n\nThe flames kind of stopped for a second, or moved slower, and I was back in the alley.\n\n“What did the fire show you?” the bum asked, fingers playing air piano near the barrel.\n\n“You know what I saw,” I told him through my teeth, wanting to leave but knowing I wouldn’t. “So what? I don’t care if they treat my dick like a charity cause. It’s still pussy.”\n\n“Have you ever loved?” His question hurt my insides, a truth lodged between ribs, stabbing at my heart.\n\n“Ever been loved?” he continued, breaking the short silence left after his first question.\n\nI couldn’t tell if the bum’s eyes reflected the fire or if they were burning themselves, glowing orange in the dark, surrounded by his weather-beaten face. The light coming from below gave his already worn-out features something that reminded me of a kid making a monster face with a flashlight, telling stories by a campfire.\n\n“When I go to a new bar I feel some people getting tired of me, real quick,” I said, realizing I’m saying things I wanted to keep to myself. “When I’ve slept with a few women and some guys have told me their not-so-unique life stories, there’s always someone getting sick and tired of the cancer guy disrupting the order. They don’t say anything, of course, but I feel it. I feel their eyes burning my back, urging the fake cancer to finish the job.”\n\nI spilled my guts, barbecuing them over the fire, and it felt good. Emptying myself, like trying to get it all out so you can stop the room from spinning and fall asleep, vomiting truths as if they were the closing tequilas you really don’t need.\n\n“So, you gonna save me or something?” I asked, equally afraid of yes’s and no’s.\n\n“Nope, can’t do that.”\n\n“I’m gonna have to help myself?”\n\n“Didn’t say that.”\n\n“So…?” I waited for the bum to continue.\n\n“So, I can’t help you. I’m just a hobo with cold hands. What are you?”\n\nI laughed. “Actually, I don’t know.”\n\n“Okay, fuck it,” the bum said, turning his fire eyes to me. “Tired of playing games. What if I made you come here? What if I wanted you here, telling me all this shit? What if I feed on it, eating your bad decisions and drinking all those feelings you got bottled up in there?”\n\nHe fingerless-glove-pointed to my heavy-breathing chest and looked at me, the orange fire in his eyes looking warmer.\n\n“W-what are you talking about?” My voice cracked, and I tried swallowing but my mouth was too dry.\n\n“What if there are beings older than time, beings born of rock and sand and dirt and wood? What if they like to hide among humans, and sow these bad feelings, filling them with stresses and guilts and worries? What if they do all that because they like the taste of it, and enjoy the human emotion smorgasbord? Maybe they don’t even need it to survive; maybe it’s just a snack for them, something in between meals.”\n\nThe bum looked at me, his orange fire eyes searing my thoughts. I felt drops of sweat on my temples when I realized I couldn’t move. I couldn’t before and I couldn’t now. The bum had lied from the start.\n\n“What if we hide in human form,” he said, and somehow seemed bigger without growing, hovering over me and standing in front of me at the same time. “We wake up, born from the earth, and we shed our soil bodies, leaving hollow trunks or dirt mounds. We vomit up our inner organs and hang them from the trees so snakes and mice won’t eat them. When we don’t make it back in time to swallow our organs, they dry and become hanging moss. And we are stuck in human form.”\n\nI tried moving again, but it felt like I was in a giant’s grip, invisible fingers around my body, pressing my arms to my sides.\n\n“When we’ve left our bodies and thrown up our organs we look like you. Like this.” He patted his chest. “And then we eat. My favorite taste is worries, the ‘what if?’ of fears. You ooze of it. I taste little worries seeping from every pore of your body. You know what I’m talking about, Jackie the cancer guy. Your big, big worry. What if…”\n\nThe bum was gone. The barrel was still there, but there was no fire and the metal was cold to the touch. I could move again, felt like waking from a bad dream I thought was real, the fear disappearing and turning into shame. Of course I could move.\n\nI left the alley, trying to suppress the thought I knew was coming. My big worry, the ‘what if?’\n\n“Jackie,” I heard the bum’s voice in my head, scorching my brain with orange eyes. “What if that lump in the back of your throat isn’t anxiety? Of course the truth is hard to swallow with that thing in your throat.” He laughed. “What if the lump isn’t angst? What if it isn’t the ones you lost, drinking to forget and struggling to remember at the same time? What if it isn’t the loathing you wake up with every morning, showering you like hangover sweat?”\n\nI swallowed, and felt the lump move.\n\n“What if the lump in your throat is cancer?”\n\nI needed a drink. I'm still drinking. It's been weeks. I've made doctor's appointments more than four times, but I always cancel them. I'm too scared of what might be the truth. Is it better not knowing?",

        "text": "   \n\n\n**Right now, it's 5:59 but it's been 5:59 for almost 24 hours now. It started when I had arrived from my flight from San Francisco to Chicago. It was like any other airport. I got off my flight, went to get food, then went to my gate. My gate was F11. I haven't forgotten it yet just in case I find it, it might be my only way out. When I got to my gate there was no one there, not even a flight attendant but I had arrived a little early, so I guessed no flight attendant had arrived yet. So, I thought “great I should probably get some sleep” (for context my I had a 2-hour layover in Chicago I thought I could take a little nap) I had fallen asleep at 5:59 am, but when i woke up it was still 5:59 am. I had opened my eyes to see nothing, no lights, no people and no airplanes. I thought it was just a dream or more a nightmare. But this kind of nightmare was one that wasn't normal. It wasn't a nightmare, it was hell. When I awoke, I got up and it was pitch black, so i picked up my phone and turned on my flashlight and it was the airport. But something was off it wasn't that it was pitch black and not that there were no people, but I could feel someone there or something…. The thing is I'm not scared, I'm just wandering I don't know where I'm going but it feels like I'm walking past the same gate every time, I've tried going left instead of right or straight and even just straight up turning around but I always end up in the same place some of the shops have gates over them and some don't the ones that don't usually have food and if they don't have food it's some other essential like water or medicine. It feels like I have searched everywhere but nowhere at the same time. There is no electricity, and my phone is at 30% as I'm writing this, and I'm scared it's going to die soon so I'm going to stop writing for a while to conserve my battery.** \n\n**UPDATE**\n\n**I heard someone I don't know what it was but it could have been anything it sounded like a laugh, no a cough or even a voice but I haven't heard it before, as soon as I heard it I ran towards it but I ended up in that stupid gate again this gate does not have a number its either too dark and I can't see it or there is just no number, I don't know why but whatever that was I hope it comes back**  \n\n**Boredom** \n\n**As of right now my phone stands at 25%. I can't tell if that's good or bad. On one hand I have my phone with power but on the other hand I don't know for how long. Right now, I'm searching for a battery pack I'm hopeful I can find one, but I think I'm slowly losing it, oh wait i should probably say the layout so you can get a better idea of where i am. When you first “enter” if that's the right word to use you will see a little gift shop on the left and that is locked but on the right there's a little store, I just call it L.S. For short, the reason I call it L.S. is because I can't see the sign. It's the same reason as the gate number either too high or too dark, once you pass L.S. you get to a burger king, the only reason I can tell it's a burger king is because of a couple wrappers I found in the trash, which I found strange because this is the only place with actual trash inside of the trash cans Maybe it's just a coincidence I don't know. Across from the burger king is a Starbucks. I don't know how to use any of the machines so for now I just drink the water, after those main places. There are a couple of little gift shops and little food stores, but most are locked and some it's just food and medicine that's the best layout I can give you for now, but I have to go because my phone is at 20% so I hope I can talk again soon.**\n\n**Hello again.** \n\n**Hey, I don't know why I “introduce myself” every time I'm not even talking to anyone. Maybe somewhere in the back of my mind I'm hopeful someone will find this. But you don't know who I am. I don't even know who I am anymore. I've been writing important things on the sticky notes I found in a drawer at L.S. I also found a stuffed bear. I named him Snoopy. Is it weird if I talk to snoopy? I think it is if I was in the normal world but this world is different so who cares you know? Well, I should get to the important stuff before I keep getting sidetracked.** \n\n* **The food is restocked every day.** \n* **I have been here for 5 days I think it never turns day or night.** \n* **I haven't heard that voice in a while, but it stays in my head.** \n* **I found a back door in the burger king I don't know where it leads but i heard buzzing in there and I'm too scared to open the door.**\n\n**UPDATE**\n\n**I heard it loud and clear this time I was trying to build up the courage to open the back door in the burger king and there it is it came from inside; I know it did I know it did. It was a laugh, this wasn't a sound of something hitting the floor like you think it is, it was a LAUGH. But when I opened the door there was nothing but stairs. My phone is at 10%. I'm starting to think I'll never get out of here. I might just run down those stairs as fast as I can no matter what happens I Will Just Keep Running.**",

        "text": "( First: https://redd.it/o8vgiw Previous: https://redd.it/11rbkdr )\n\nRecently we’ve made a habit of having Max over for lunch or dinner on Sundays. Sunny always made too much food and Max loved to take care of that for us. He and Sunny got along so well that it was nice to have him by when he could. We planned to see him at lunch but as the minutes ticked by with no Max, we started to get worried. \n\n“He hasn’t sent you a text, or anything?” Sunny asked. \n\nMax had a cell phone for work but barely used it. I checked my phone already knowing there would be no messages. I shook my head and that caused Sunny to start pacing. \n\n“It’s only a little bit after one. He might have gotten distracted by something. You know how he is.” I said but not really believing my own words. \n\nMax might play around a lot, but he was good at giving us a heads-up if he was going to be late. I stayed on the couch with my phone in hand. Sunny paced around the apartment and fiddled with my uniform jacket. He kept checking it over and folding it. It was as if he expected a call to come through that got me out of the apartment. I didn’t plan on taking any more jobs on my days off for a while. I let him fuss about as I sent another message to Max hoping he responded. \n\nA few minutes later my phone started to ring. I took the call without looking at the number. \n\n“Max?” I asked hoping it was my friend. \n\n“No kiddo, it’s Rufus. I borrowed his phone to call you.” Came the answer on the other end. \n\nMy heart sank for an unknown reason. Max was just late. Nothing bad had happened. I needed to keep telling myself that so I didn’t freak out. \n\n“Are you busy today? I have something important to talk to you about. I would like you to come over to our place.” Rufus explained in a low voice as if he was also trying to stay calm. \n\nSunny peeked in from the doorway waiting for me to tell him what was going on. I doubted Rufus would beat around the bush if his son got in real trouble. I got up to start towards the door. Sunny followed behind, his hands nervously fluttering about unable to stay still. With his help, I got my uniform jacket on with the phone still up to my ear. \n\n“I’ll come over. Should Sunny come with me?” I asked. \n\n“No. It’s best if he stays home. He’s a bit weak for this sort of thing. I can create a connection to your apartment that’ll bring you here. I just need your permission to use your door.” Rufus replied, his calm tone cracking for a second. \n\nNow I got nervous. Really, really nervous. I’ve heard a little bit about how connecting two doorways worked. It required a lot of magic to make one door lead to another. The Mailing company had no issues creating doorways to bring me to a Zero room and send me back closer to home at the end of each day. It could be any two doors. Even fake drawn-on ones. Belizas and Max had enough magic to create the occasional connection. From what I understood, Max and Rufus lived in a different world than myself. It cost a great deal of magic to create a connection to a door from between worlds. The further, the more magic. Whatever was going on must be a big deal for Rufus to toss enough energy around to get me to his world the easy way. \n\nI gave him permission and soon heard a click at my front door. I hung up after saying I would see him shortly. \n\n“Whatever is going on... Just be careful.” Sunny told me. \n\nHe cared about Max a great deal. If Max didn’t come back to us, I don’t know if Sunny could handle it. I gave my roommate a quick hug because I felt like he needed it. I promised that no matter what, we would be hanging out with our lovable dog friend soon. \n\nI bravely opened the door unsure of what to expect. A strong breeze came with the smell of countless flowers. My foot sank into deep soil on the other side. With one last glance at Sunny and my apartment, I pushed on into a strange new world. \n\nThe door opened into what I assumed to be a greenhouse. A very, very large one. A dome of glass towered over my head and the place was covered in alien plant life. Outside the sky looked a deep navy blue as if the sun was just setting. I followed a path through the overgrowth and found Rufus making his way over to find me. It was the first time I've seen him out of his uniform. I almost needed to look away from him as he got closer. His top was just a very tight-fitting black shirt with no sleeves. A pair of baggy brown pants were tied to his waist with some sort of rope. I knew Rufus was stacked, but his uniform jacket did wonders hiding just how buff my friend was. For some reason, he appeared slightly more animalistic than normal. His teeth were larger and sharper along with his eyes that almost glowed in the low light. His arms were covered in fur that disappeared under his shirt. I could have sworn he was taller too. \n\nHis smile was uneasy when he stopped in front of me. I could tell he held himself back when he hugged me in the past. I now understood how easily Rufus could have crushed me in the past with a slightly over-excited hug. \n\n“My wife would like to meet you. I wanted to talk to you first to tell you something. No matter what she says or does, if you don’t feel up to listening then the end result is not your fault.” He said but I was just confused by his words. \n\nI opened my mouth to ask him to explain, but decided to just nod. I would find out what he meant shortly. Asking him now just delayed things. I followed behind him, my mind buzzing with questions. And my phone also buzzed in my pocket. Because it had been given to me by the Mailing Company, it worked in different worlds. Vicky sent me a message asking if everything was alright. Sunny must have sent her a text asking if she knew about anything that was going on. He also had a phone through work but used it less than Max did. \n\nI put my phone away not wanting to get distracted by the messages. We left the greenhouse behind into an oddly empty room. Florescent lights flickered above us. Rufus’s claws against the hard cement flooring were the only sounds. \n\nAs we walked, I could make out a person sitting in a chair in the distance. I squinted and then blinked trying to see better. All of a sudden Rufus was in front of me. I slammed into his back and he quickly spun around to catch me before I fell. \n\n“This is the human that my little boy gave his name to?” \n\nThe voice came from nearby. I looked up seeing that somehow, we stood a few steps away from the person in the chair. Her voice held a slight Russian accent. She stood, her form taking my breath away. \n\nShe was taller than Rufus which was a feat. Her black heels may have helped with that. She wore a low-cut black dress that shone with scales. The fabric with one cut up her right leg and the bottom of the dress spilled onto the floor. Her hands folded in front, sparkling sharp claws shining in the light. Her hair looked much like long white ribbons that moved slightly behind her. Dark eyes looked down at me as she stuck up a sharp nose at the sight of the human before her. \n\nIf Rufus married her because of her looks alone, I could understand that. I’ve yet to see someone with every feature as perfect as hers. \n\n“Toby, this is Kytiva. She’s Max’s stepmother.” \n\nI nodded unable to speak due to her icy glare in my direction. I knew she didn’t think highly of me. She and Rufus weren’t alike in the slightest. I didn’t even know how she was the mother of all the nice sisters I’d met. Everything about her told me I wasn’t wanted there. So, why bother asking me to come to speak with her? \n\n“Boy, I do not believe you fully understand what it means for a creature to give away their true name.” Kytiva started to speak. \n\nI suddenly got heated. She and Sterling both assumed I didn’t know how important true names were. But I did. I doubted either of them ever had been trusted with someone’s entire soul before. They were trying to tell me I didn’t understand something they didn’t have a clue about. Thankfully, Rufus placed a hand on my shoulder stopping an argument. I calmed down enough to listen. \n\n“I gave you and Max a little bit of time together. That was a kindness on my part. By him giving up his name, he has adopted you into our family. However, I do not approve of that. I do not know what a weak human like yourself did to get my son to hand himself over to you. I refuse to accept you. I am kinder than others, so I shall let you prove your worth.” She said with her arms crossed over her chest. \n\nRufus started to crack a little. A nervous bead of sweat ran down the side of his face. I didn’t know what kind of test Kytiva had in mind, but it didn’t seem good. If I refused, would I never be able to see Max again? Did she have the power to do that? \n\n“Sweetheart, Toby is human. What you planned is too much.” Rufus brought up, his voice meek and out of character for him. \n\n“Don’t you sweetheart me! This boy should have expected such a thing to happen! And besides, I am only tossing him into parts of The Maze. We are standing in it at the moment. For this test, I removed a few sections. The human is only required to travel through and reach my little boy. Fully reach my boy. This is almost the same as his job.” She answered back slightly annoyed. \n\nI looked around realizing this place did feel a lot like The Maze. With it changing so often, it was hard to tell when you were inside it besides the odd air. Kytiva needed to be pretty powerful if she could take pieces of The Maze. No wonder Rufus got nervous talking back to her. I looked between them wondering just how hard this test turned out to be. \n\n“What happens if I refuse? Or if I fail the test?” I asked, my stomach twisting. \n\nShe didn’t need to say the answer. I already knew it. \n\n“Then Max shall die.” \n\nMy body turned cold and it felt like I started to sink into the ground. Rufus did say that if I refused, then he wouldn’t blame me. But that didn’t make it better. Max still would be dead if I walked away. My knee-jerk reaction was to snap at her and demand why a stepmother would endanger her child's life, but I held back. After working with creatures, I sort of understood the reason. Max gave up his name. He tied himself to a human and that made his entire family appear weak. If I didn’t prove I had something of value, then it meant Max didn’t either. And with some supernatural families, weakness wasn’t permitted. \n\n“Fine. Show me where to start.” I told her steeling my resolve. \n\nNo matter what, I was going to save Max. I refused to die during this test. I promised myself that we would make it out of there alive and back to the home waiting for us. Rufus let his face drop. He couldn’t stop his wife from sacrificing one son for their family's name. But he didn’t want to lose another person he cared about on the same day. I didn’t blame him for the lack of confidence in me. I didn’t believe in myself either. I just refused to believe that anything was going to happen to Max. \n\nKytiva nodded and turned her head towards a doorway that wasn’t so close before. With The Maze, anything could happen. I was tempted to send a message to Sunny but didn’t want to upset him. If I died then Rufus needed to break the news to everyone. I felt a little bad leaving him that task. \n\nWith one last deep breath, I stepped forward into the dark doorway unsure of what awaited ahead of me. My foot landed on a soft feeling that I recognized. One that I never wanted to feel again. I covered my mouth and nose with my hand trying to fight back the smell of the room. I’ve seen one like this before way back on my first day. \n\nThe door behind me disappeared the moment I walked into the room leaving me trapped inside the space covered with gore. The carpet soaked through and the walls were painted a deep red. Some blood dripped downwards from the ceiling in a sporadic rhythm. My body screamed to run away. I didn’t want to see this. My shoulders tensed up as a dark shape the same shade as the blood start to rise from the floor. A person came from the carpet, covered in gore and they weakly reached for the only other one in the room. I dropped my hand and pushed them both inside my jacket pockets to hide the trembling. \n\n“Hey let’s go....” \n\nI started walking, my voice weak in a whisper of a song. I’ve gotten through this once before. I just needed to keep walking. \n\n“I’m happy as can be...” \n\nAs I moved more of those blood-covered people came from the floor. They stayed inside the gory carpet and half out reaching for the terrified person near them. I kept my pace steady and walked around any of them making sure I stayed out of arms reach. \n\n“Let’s go w-walking you and me.” \n\nAn arm shot up and tugged at my leg. I shook it off and didn’t even stop singing. Well, I wasn’t really singing. Mostly just saying the lyrics out loud in order not to scream. \n\n“Ready set, come on let’s go.” \n\nMore hands came up grasping my clothing. So many of those arms came from the ceiling and the walls. I heard them moving behind me but I refused to look back. I pushed on, feeling as if I was walking through deep snow. My shoes stuck to the carpet with each step. In the distance, I barely made out a door. I just needed to keep pushing. Just a little bit more. \n\n“Over the hill-” \n\nMy words got cut off as my footing came out from under me. I slammed down onto the ground. The moment I landed; those hands swarmed me. I struggled in vain trying to get away. My legs getting pulled down into the floor as if it was made up of nothing but bloody arms all grabbing. I kicked getting nowhere. My hands grasped at anything, but I still kept getting dragged down. A bloody hand fell into my own causing hot pain to travel up my arm. I let out a scream as the flesh on the back of my hand slowly started to burn off. If these creatures got my uniform off, I would have my skin melted off like them. \n\nI gritted my teeth against the pain. This was only the first part of the test and yet I was already going to die. With all the effort I could muster, I pushed up with my elbows and gained some ground back. In a matter of seconds, those hands would be able to drag me further down. I searched my brain trying to figure out what to do and how to stay alive. \n\nJust as I thought I was going to die; something grabbed the back of my jacket and lifted my entire body out of the floor. Those bloody creatures let out displeased cries when their target got stolen away. I rolled and recovered to look over to see if I needed to deal with a new threat. But hope came to my chest because I knew right away who had just arrived. \n\nA massive wolf stood in the middle of the room, eyes blazing and claws sharp. When he stomped a paw down on the ground, grass and other plant sprouted up taking over the bloody floor. Vines crawled up each leg as flowers bloomed. Expect on one differently colored back leg. With a great howl, the beast tossed out power that knocked back the bloody shapes, but only for a few moments. \n\n“Go!” The word came as mostly a deep growl that echoed through the room. \n\n“Rufus... Thank you!” I wanted to tell him a hundred other things as well. \n\nWe didn’t have time for that. I just ran leaving him behind to deal with the blood room so I could try and stay alive in the next part of the test. \n\nI nearly tripped into the next area. My feet stumbled over each other causing me to stop running when I got through the next door. The smell of blood disappeared to be replaced by old car oil and gasoline. I stopped to get my footing. The next room was an empty parking garage. Stone pillars and painted on yellow lines far as I could see. The area I stood in had some weak fluorescent lights flickering overhead. The dim orange light faded off into darkness just a few feet away. \n\nI carefully took a few steps forwards expecting anything to jump out. The blood from the other room that soaked my clothing slowly faded but the burn on the back of my hand remained. I blocked out the pain to keep going. My nerves fried. When a slight noise above came, I jumped out of the way knowing that something was about to drop down on my head. \n\nI made the right call. A creature landed on the ground just as I moved away. It caught me with a swipe of a long tail sending me hard into a stone pillar. It knocked the wind from me but without my uniform on, the attack would have broken a few ribs. My eyes landed on the creature as I tried to find a safe path to get away. \n\nThe dark thing was made up of countless shining steel wires I assumed to be hair at first. Each wire a deep black instead of a shiny grey. They all twisted into each other making up a skinny cat-like body with a tail that trailed behind. The face was nothing but a ball of wires that cracked open into a gruesome smile. \n\nIt let out a loud ear-piercing screech and a white light started in the creature’s mouth. I ducked behind the pillar as protection. Seconds later a blast of hot white light shot around the stone blinding my eyes for a few moments. The powerful blast melted away half the pillar. If I got caught by that, it would be all over. I ran around the pillar trying to get to the next one. The creature spotted me and got down low. \n\nThe light started in the ball of wires again. I didn’t have time to get to the next pillar. The first one wouldn’t survive another blast. Even if I curled up, my uniform didn’t cover everything. I made a split-second decision that saved my life. \n\nIn a flash of movement, I took off my jacket. With it in hand, I charged at the monster and wrapped my jacket around its head as tightly as I could. It attempted to get away, the head shaking nearly making me lose my grip. I held on tight. The light came from under the uniform and I felt a sudden force against the fabric. The powerful blast could not get through the uniform and backfired. The white light traveled through the creature’s neck and exploded the stomach outwards. \n\nI collapsed, my arms stinging from the pressure of the attack. The creature’s corpse smoking next to me. I didn’t have time to recover as another one of them dropped down. I snapped my face forwards. By sheer luck, I brought the jacket up in time. With some effort, I wrapped it around this other creature’s head the same as the first. It nearly got away but I stood up and wrapped both arms around the thin neck. \n\nI took a hold of the head and using all the strength in my arms, I start to twist it. Sweat dripped down my face and my muscles burned from the effort. I didn’t stop until I heard a sickening crack and the creature stopped moving. \n\nI stopped again needing to take a break. Off in the darkness, I heard more of those creatures moving ever closer. I didn’t have time to sit and recover. I need to make a run for it before they got over here. I wasn’t going to be lucky forever. \n\nI got up reflecting on how a year ago I would not be able to run this much. I’d improved a great deal, but I was only human. In the middle of running while putting my jacket back on, a creature dropped behind me. I only got one arm through the sleeve when the wired claw grabbed my foot. \n\nWith brutal strength, the thing lifted me off my feet and slammed my body against the hard cement. I heard ribs cracking and my leg breaking in multiple places. I didn’t have time to process the pain as the thing brought me up again to hit my other side on the ground. The one arm inside my uniform was the only limb saved from being broken. \n\nEverything hurt like hell. My vision swam and I thought I was already dead. Through everything, I noticed a small object within my reach. Without thinking I grabbed it and flicked the switch. The Sunlight that slipped from my pocket flickered on evaporating the creature and others hiding in the darkness. \n\nBecause I’d used it recently the light wasn’t as powerful as before. It faded after a few seconds leaving me in darkness and pain. Blood flooded my mouth making me choke. I was unable to tell if my eyes were closed, or if I was dead. \n\nI thought I felt someone lift my broken body off the ground and my head rested on something soft. Voices came but I didn’t know who they belonged to, or what they said. My mouth got forced open and someone tearfully apologized for the pain that was going to come next. My body was already broken all to hell, what could be worse than this? \n\nI very quickly found out what hurt more than getting most of your bones broken. Them mending back together caused so much pain I thought I might not make it. A burning flooded over my entire body and I felt each bone move back into place. I knew I was screaming but wasn’t aware of anything but my erratic heartbeat. \n\nI think I died for a few seconds. Or at least my heart did stop beating. I came to, gasping for air as someone sat above me doing chest compressions. I knew the face but never thought she could ever look so upset. I wanted to speak but the sight of a wire creature right above us ready to strike made me react first. I sat up and covered her with half my jacket just in time. The creature’s claws grazed my forehead creating a long cut but didn’t dig into my savior's flesh. \n\nWe didn’t have time to move and thankfully didn’t need to. Another person came up, her hair blazing as she landed a punch on the monster that knocked it back into the darkness. \n\n“Thanks...” Vicky said her voice still strained with tears. \n\nBelizas looked down at my bleeding forehead. She bent over and ran a fiery hot fingertip over the cut to close the wound. I let her know exactly how I felt about that but she didn't care. \n\n“I’m going to go punch some more stuff!” She said which was to be expected. \n\nI let her run off and almost felt pity for the creatures in the darkness. Almost.  \n\n“What...” I tried to speak but my stomach twisted in pain so suddenly it made me double over. \n\nVicky reached into her pocket and pulled out some energy bars which I gladly took from her. I’ve never felt so damn hungry in my life. I could eat ten pounds of garlic bread and still want more. \n\n“We gave you some vampire blood. It’s compatible with pretty much every species and burns off magic to heal wounds. But you’re human so you don’t have magic to burn. It fed off your body fat and some muscles. I pushed some of my magic through your body to make sure the blood didn’t kill you trying to burn up resources.” Vicky explained over the distant cackling of Belizas. \n\nI shook my head trying to get past the lingering pain. I looked down at my arms shocked at how thin they were. My clothing hung off my now small frame. Thank God for Sunny. If he didn’t cook so much, I would have died trying to heal. \n\n“Was Alty the one who gave you some blood? And why couldn’t you use your magic for the blood to feed off of instead of it burning up my body?” I asked just trying to stay focused on anything but the stiffness in my muscles.  \n\n“I could only let your body take in so much. Human bodies can’t deal with that much magic or they suffer from blowback. It's the same with creatures. We can’t absorb unlimited magic. It can kill us. I did my best with what I could give.” She said with a small regretful smile. \n\nI knew Vicky didn’t want me to suffer as much pain as I did. But at least I wasn’t dead so I owed her more than I could ever repay. Belizas suddenly came rolling near us. A creature got a good hit in on her knocking her back. But it didn't seem to do anything to her besides get her excited. She turned her head towards us, flashing sharp teeth. \n\n“You should keep going! We’ll take care of this!” She happily said. \n\nI nodded fully trusting them both. I stood with Vicky needed to help support my weight for a second. Before Belizas ran off again, I told them exactly how I felt about them coming to help. \n\n“Thank you. I love both of you girls.” \n\nIt was nice to say those words and for them to know I didn’t imply it romantically. I truly loved every single one of the friends I’ve made over the year. Monster or not. Belizas wasn’t expecting something so sincere. Her cheeks started to burn as a sound much like a kettle boiling over came from her direction. With a scream of embarrassment, she took off leaving flaming footprints behind. \n\nI pulled away from Vicky ready to head towards the next door I just spotted. She stopped me for a second. \n\n“Wait, here. I got you this. It's a day late though.” \n\nShe held out her hand for me to take something small. She placed an enamel heart-shaped pin in my head. The pin had a band of black, grey, white, and purple. It took me a moment to piece together what the colors meant. I blinked away tears as a happy feeling filled my chest to the point it might burst. \n\n“Happy Birthday Toby.” \n\nI’d completely forgotten my birthday. It had been a year since I met Vicky, hadn't it? I never would have expected the girl I wanted to try and hook up with would be handed me an Ace pride pin a year later. I put on my jacket and weirdly enough, the pin had no issues going through the fabric. I never understood the pride the different flags brought until someone fully accepted the one that described who I was. \n\nI left Vicky to head to the next area feeling much more hopeful about my chances. I didn’t know if getting help would mean my test would be voided. All I cared about was reaching Max and staying alive. \n\nI shot through the door and into an open space. It still felt like The Maze but didn’t look like how I’d seen it before. A ruined city sat, skyscrapers on their side, crumbling. Off in the distance, I saw a pristine glass dome. I assumed that might be where to go next. I didn’t wait around to see what was going to come at me.",

Cottage 14 was on fire and although it was set back away from the others, its proximity to the bare branches of the adjacent woods made me fear a greater conflagration. Jake and I sputtered, unable to move, my body desperate for clean air. \n\nRené, however, pressed forward unaffected. Though I could barely see him, I felt him brush past me. I caught his sleeve.\n\n“What are you doing?” I coughed.\n\n“I didn’t build it,” he said, almost as if in a daze.\n\n“What?”\n\n“This cottage. I didn’t build it.”\n\n“It’s still on fire!”\n\n“An illusion.”\n\n“Easy to say when you’re not the one suffocating!” Jake shouted.\n\n“Trust me.”\n\nHe took my arm and guided me towards the cottage wreathed in smoke. Jake cursed, but followed behind us. I pulled my sweater over my mouth and squinted, eyes stinging. As we approached the cottage, I glimpsed the bright orange flames licking at the flaking paint, but, to my surprise, I felt no heat. Neither did I see the paint blacken and curl, nor the old wood beginning to collapse from such a powerful fire. René was right.\n\n“You have our attention!” René addressed the cottage. \n\n“I actually think they only speak French,” I wheezed. René raised his eyebrows and gave me a quizzical look, but shouted something in French.\n\nThe smoke and flames retreated, as though pulled back inside the cottage by an invisible force, leaving Jake and I heaving, gulping down the fresh air. René examined the cottage with an inscrutable expression on his face that veered between skepticism and curiosity. \n\nWhen I was finally able to breathe, I told him about my prior experience in Cottage 14. I told him about the hands in the dark, the sad wraiths writhing in flames, their admonition to not be alone. \n\n“The notebook says not to speak to them.”\n\nRené chuckled. “Well, I’ve already violated that rule, haven’t I?”\n\n“I suppose that if this was their way of getting our attention, then they have something to say. And I finally have someone who can help me understand them.”\n\n“But if René didn’t build this cottage, then who did?” Jake interjected. “Then again, something about this place doesn’t feel like…well, like *her.*” \n\nRené nodded.\n\n“No, it does not,” he agreed.\n\n“How can you tell?” I asked.\n\n“I don’t feel like gnawing my arm off when I look at it.” Jake replied.\n\n“Okay, then!”\n\n“This is something else entirely,” René said, gazing at the now-darkened cottage. The only remains of the fire that had blazed moments ago were tiny tendrils of smoke escaping from cracks in the windows. “We should go inside.”\n\n“Go ahead,” Jake said, pulling out a pack of cigarettes. “I’ll wait for you out here.”\n\nI hesitated, remembering the impenetrable dark of my last encounter, the feeling of being unmoored from physical reality. René held out his hand. I took it and inhaled deeply.\n\n“Don’t let go,” I whispered.\n\n“Not a chance,” he said.\n\nWe stepped inside and it was as it had been the last time I entered, darkness so thick it was as though we were immersing ourselves in deep sea water. Once again, there was no sign of the windows, no sign of the door that closed behind us, sealing us inside. I could not see René, but I felt his grip and the wooden floor beneath my feet. I steadied my breathing, tethering myself to my sense of touch.\n\nThough I was not laying down, as the notebook mandated, hands began to pat my shoulders. I felt them comb through my hair, little murmurs at my ears of reassurance. They found my hand holding tightly to René’s and that seemed to unnerve them, they tried to pry us away.\n\n“I don’t think they like me very much,” René said in a low voice. \n\n“Probably because you’re a cold, dead body.”\n\nThe crowd of voices began to rise, increasingly agitated by René’s presence.\n\n“I’m going to address them,” he said. “I’ll translate.”\n\nI squeezed his hand, still too afraid to transgress an instruction of the notebook myself. The following conversation took place in French. For the sake of convenience, I am transcribing René’s translation here.\n\n“I apologize if my presence is unwelcome here. I promise that I have come only to assist Nora.”\n\nAt the sound of his voice, the murmurs died down. In a sudden flash, the darkness around us transformed into a bright white light of equal thickness, like being trapped in a cloud. Before us was the shadowy form of a human, the figure that had addressed me before. Now, she appeared to have more substance, though I still could not make out any discernable features.\n\n“We have no quarrel with you, blood drinker.” Her voice was still raspy, but more robust. It was low and calm.  \n\n“Who are you?” he asked. \n\n“We began as you began. Mortal, long ago. We lived here together, on this land: French, Métis, native peoples. Living on what we could catch in the river and hunt in the forest, with some meager crops when those failed. But though we were peaceful, we fell victim to enemies for reasons long forgotten. Pointless, as all violence is.\n\nWe perished in agony. We perished in flame. When our mortal bodies were consumed, we knew no peace. We were bound here, to this patch of land embracing the mighty river, weakened, wandering wraiths shuddering in the dark. As the centuries passed, we forgot our human lives, forgot the sadness along with the joy. Weak as we were, we became guardians of sorts, perhaps saving a harvest here, fishing a child out of the water there. It was all we could do.\n\nThen she came. This creature who torments you. She is an old, mean thing. You call her a witch, but she is far more than that. Her name is ancient. You know this, blood drinker. \n\nShe claimed this place as her own, but she is mistaken. This land belongs to no one. She took no notice of us, as a mountain lion takes no notice of the crickets chirping underfoot. But her power unwittingly stirred something inside of us, it strengthened us.  For the first time, we were capable of manifesting ourselves and we did so to the mortal woman who cared for this land. \n\nShe was frightened, at first, as they all are. We told her we wanted to help. She spoke our tongue; she told us that this place was poisoned by evil now. She was full of despair. She feared for her young son. But still, fearful though she was, she did not hesitate to extend to us the hospitality of her hearth. She offered us her own home, she bid us to step out of the shuddering dark. She knew we were not of the one who had cursed them.”\n\n“Ellen,” I whispered. I could make out an almost imperceptible nod of the spirit’s head.\n\nThe spirit continued, now addressing me with René continuing to translate.\n\n“At first, we did not understand her offer, we did not remember what it meant to be extended such a kindness. We were creatures of the shadows. But at her hearth, we remembered our own long-lost humanity. We remembered belonging. We asked her for a home and that every so often we could have a reminder of human touch, of the miracle of the living. She readily agreed. They built this place for us, set back in the trees. A place of our own. They visited us every so often. We remembered warmth again.\n\nWe did not have much to give them for such a gift. For though we were not as weak as we once had been, we were still just flickering candles against the inferno that threatened them. We gave them our blessing, a blessing that would be conferred by their blood. They would suffer under the burden of this curse, even die. That we were powerless to undo. But their souls would not be dragged down to perdition.  Whatever happened here, they would not know the eternal flames.\n\nThe thing you call the witch, the thing that grins in the dark, she now knows we are here, but we are beyond her reach. She threatened your people never to speak with us, making us appear as simply one more entity in service to her. And so, we have watched and grieved with those you loved. We tried to help you. We used every ounce of strength we could muster to awaken this blood drinker, her old foe who slept unwillingly here. We understood the danger and tried to warn you to stay away until the blood drinker could make himself whole, but we do not know the words of your tongue.”\n\n“Is that what you meant?” I asked, tightening my grip on René’s hand, tears stinging my eyes. “When you said I should not let myself be alone?” \n\nRené looked at me with guilt and compassion, and then translated for the spirit.\n\n“You are stronger together,” she said. “Though I understand that we have regrettably caused a painful loss. Martina was a generous soul and she is now at peace, have no fear.”\n\nAt the sound of her name, something loosened within me and I couldn’t fight the sobs that followed. *At peace*. I could almost sense her with me, reassuring me, and I knew the spirit was telling the truth.\n\n“The light on in the cottage,” I said, gathering words through my tears. “The light that brought us together. That was you too, wasn’t it?”\n\n“You are correct.”\n\nThe events of the past month flashed before me, as though pages being flipped in a book. I sighed. My heart was full. Fear, grief, love, friendship, all were fitted together, crowded inside of me. I had one more question.\n\n“Am I going to die?”\n\n“All must die.”\n\n“No, I mean…I saw the phantom head. Is that a curse? Is it ever…wrong?”\n\nThe spirit flickered and I knew our time was short.\n\n“It is a premonition of what will come. We have no power to stop it.” \n\nA hot wave of anxiety rushed through my body.  René squeezed my hand.\n\n“Do not fear. Cling to each other. Remember our blessing and let it strengthen you for what must pass.”\n\nHands pressed themselves into my shoulders and touched my cheeks with affection. I felt myself falling backwards, but I was not afraid. I opened my eyes on the floor of the cottage, my back against the wood.  René was already sitting up beside me, his expression troubled. The cottage had returned to the appearance of being abandoned, the door once again visible. René helped me up. I opened my mouth to say something to him, but I was interrupted by a chilling scream.\n\n“Jake!” I cried.\n\nWith a preternatural leap, René threw open the cottage door and I rushed out behind him. Jake was nowhere to be found. I felt something underneath my boot and found a cigarette still lit, embers glowing in the waning dark. Jake screamed again and this time, we could make him out. He was being dragged away, his hands scraping the frozen ground, desperate to hold on to anything. He was enveloped in a sickly green flame. The flames surrounded him, bobbing up and down. With a lurch, I recognized the rotting things at their core, still displaying faces of agony, though now collapsed and decomposing. *Turnips.*\n\n“Fuck!” I yelled.\n\nRené went after him with me following distantly. He recouped the distance between them with hardly any effort. But the turnips were not afraid of him like last time. They unleashed a buzzing drone that cut through my ears and threw me to the ground. Even René put his hands up to his ears, but pushed forward, as though he were pushing against some unknown force separating us from Jake. Jake fought ferociously against his captors, though he too writhed with pain, scratching at his ears. I noticed his hands elongating, claws emerging, his face lengthening into the muzzle of the beast, human cries transforming into the howling of a wounded animal.\n\nRené lunged towards Jake and for a moment I thought he had him, but just as it seemed like he would make contact, the green flame blazed upwards with a gust and bore them away in a great vortex, the putrid faces of the turnips peering back at us in mockery. René fell to the ground with a thud.\n\nJake was gone.\n\n[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wine_Dark_Sea_1239/)",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11s146h/did_you_ever_play_a_secret_playstation_game_from/",
        "text": "The game was an unmarked disc. Not even a color. Just a plain piece of plastic. Yet, I was horrified when I saw it in my dream. \n\nI popped up in the middle of the night and there was no way I was going to be able to go back to sleep. I laid in my bed and thought about why that Playstation game was so terrifying to me. \n\nThe game appeared at Corey’s house when I was 13. He had moved down the street from me shortly before and I made fast friends with him because he always had all of the best games. Corey’s dad worked for an electronics distributor so he got the games early.\n\nCorey was waiting for me when I got home from the school bus one day. His dad had gotten a crazy new game “from Japan” no one else would ever have. He had spent the day playing it over and over again. \n\nHe showed me the unmarked disc before he put it in the Playstation. The game had no opening credits or menu. It just went straight into the gameplay - spitting you into a P.O.V. game in a murky building which seemed like an army base. \n\nI’m hesitant to describe the game too much. One - because I don’t remember it perfectly because of the way it shredded my brain. Two - because I don’t want to pass on any of the trauma the game gave me to anyone else. \n\nFrom what I remember, the game was relatively unfinished, and that made it more eerie - the monsters were just blank outlines without faces which would kill you, the music was low and humming and barely audible, everything was dark, the controls were jerky. \n\nYet, the game was incredibly addicting. I played it over and over and over again until my parents made me come home. \n\nI stayed up almost all night thinking about the game. When I did sleep, I felt like I was just in the game in my head. \n\nCorey wasn’t at school the next day again. I didn’t think anything of it until I walked out of class at the end of the day and saw local news T.V. trucks parked out front. \n\nI heard what they were talking about, interviewing students and parents. An unnamed student had killed himself and his family that day at their home. I found out it was Corey on the bus ride home. \n\nVery few details came out. All I ever found out was Corey took the dad’s shotgun and shot both parents, and his older sister, all in bed, all still sleeping. I didn’t want to know much more. \n\nI stopped playing video games for a while. Yet, the game wouldn’t get out of my head. I just kept wanting to play it. \n\nI eventually went to the video game store at the mall. It was lorded over by a man named Morton. Obese. 20s. Shoulder-length hair, and an air of odd arrogance, he made video game shopping at a suburban town in Ohio feel like you were trying to buy records in Brooklyn.\n\nI approached Morton with fear. He was a hulking figure to my 13-year-old self and he had his own little empire at the only game store in town. \n\n“I’m looking for a game, I, uh, um, my friend had it, but I can’t find it,” I started in.\n\n“Ta-ta-ta-today…junior,” Morton mocked me with a line from Billy Madison. \n\nThe other guys in the store chuckled, turning my face to beat red. \n\n“Have you ever heard about an unmarked Playstation game ‘from Japan?”’ I asked.\n\nEveryone about Morton changed. He looked around the space to see if anyone was still listening then he motioned me closer, and spoke quieter. \n\n“Where did you see that game?” He asked. \n\nNow it was my turn to get closer and talk quietly. I explained it was Corey, and who he was, and what he did. \n\nMorton looked even more interested, and stressed out. \n\nHe took me to a back room. Dark, the only light coming from an arcade machine in the back and a lit cigarette dangling from the teenage lips of another kid. \n\nI knew the kid. His name was Nat. He was 15 and was known in the area as a video game prodigy. He had won just about any tournament for any game ever held in several counties and he had an interesting style - he had long hair at a time when everyone had short, he wore tight clothes at a time when everyone wore baggy, and there were rumors he did professional video game testing in California during school breaks. Nat hanging out in the secret back room of the video game store was very on-brand. \n\nMorton had me sit down at a table as he started demolishing fun size candy bars while he told me the backstory of the video game “from Japan.”\n\nThe game wasn’t from Japan. He wasn’t sure where that mythology came from. The game was very much from the U.S. It was created by the U.S. government. When school shootings started becoming a thing there was a panic about video games, specifically first-person shooter games being the cause. \n\nThe C.I.A.’s solution was to work with a video company to create a first-person shooter game to release and hype up but to subliminally program as to control the player’s mind and steer them to non-violent thoughts. \n\n“How do you know all this?” I asked Morton.\n\n“The game is a real thing,” Nat said while never stopping banging away at the latest version of Mortal Kombat on the machine in the corner.\n\nI let Morton go on. Nat was the ultimate authority to me. His girlfriend, Calyn, was my first love, even though she didn’t know who I was. She was a year ahead of me in school and I didn’t even know how she existed. \n\nBut back to the game. The game didn’t keep kids from being violent. Video games couldn’t fucking do that, but something they programmed in the game destroyed the kids who tested it - they couldn’t focus on anything else and it terrorized their minds - making them think monsters were coming to kill them, basically making them severely schizophrenic. \n\nThe worst part was something in the game seemed to make kids really want to share it. All of the test kids snuck the game out and made copies of it. \n\nUnless someone was skilled enough to make it through the game and beat it, the game seemed to ruin their brains, and their lives, Morton explained before saying he was out of information. \n\n“Have you played the game?” Morton asked me.\n\nI affirmed. \n\n“Where is the game now?” Morton asked. \n\nI explained I had no idea. I assumed it was with Corey’s family and their stuff. No way I could get access to it. \n\nAt that point Morton explained that he wished me luck, but he could offer me no help. \n\n“Do you know who has ever beaten the game?” I asked Morton as I could feel his body energy beg me to leave. \n\n“I have,” Nat’s voice rose up from the corner of the room. \n\nNat left the room before I could ask anymore questions. \n\n\\-\n\nThe game permeated my brain. All I wanted to do was play it even though I had no way to. I would see the monsters hiding in the shadows of my parents’ house and I’d stop - wait for them to jump out and attack me. I heard that terribly ominous musical score of the game in the back of my mind all the time. \n\nIf I slept, all I dreamed about was the game, and getting killed in the game, and it all felt real. \n\nThis went on for a couple of days and kept getting stronger and stronger. I had to keep playing the game. \n\nI lost control. I got out of bed in the middle of the night and snuck out my bedroom window. \n\nI made it to Corey’s house in a flash. There was no police tape or anything you’d expect in a movie. It was just there. The way it always was. \n\nI went to the back of the house, where I knew there was a door that went directly into the basement, where Corey’s gaming setup was. I took the longshot that it was left unlocked. \n\nNow this all might sound crazy, but as a severe drug addict for a good chunk of my life, trust me that my desire to play that game that night was stronger than any desire to ever do drugs, that’s how intoxicating and addicting it was. Nothing was going to stop me. \n\nThe door was unlocked and if you want to doubt that small town cops 25 years ago were that lazy…try me. \n\nI got into the basement. The house was cold, dark, and empty, but Corey’s Playstation was still set up right there in the basement. I checked the disc inside. It was the game. \n\nI turned on the Playstation and the game came to life. I started playing. \n\nMy feet felt like they were welded to the floor. My fingers superglued to the controller. My eyes couldn’t leave the screen. \n\nThere was no getting away from the game. I played for I have no idea how long. \n\nI can’t remember anything until I was standing in that dark basement, playing the game, and I felt strong hands wrap around the back of my neck. Then a powerful force pushed me to the ground. \n\nI was on the ground and I looked up and saw endless shadows filling the room around me. Dark and faceless. They looked just like the monsters in the game. \n\nThe monsters were moving in on me. They were no longer in the game. They were no longer in my head. They were now living breathing with me and dangerous. \n\nAnd they were going to be on me very soon and the power they radiated at me communicated to me that I wasn’t going to last long against them. \n\nI also got a powerful sense of something they wanted me to do. They were telling me to go to school the next day. They were telling me where my dad kept his gun. I was losing myself in their messages. \n\nThen all of these feelings started to fade. Then the TV cut out - the game no longer broadcasting. \n\nSomeone else was in the room. Not just me and the monsters. They were dressed in all black. I couldn’t make out anything identifiable about them, other than they were human like me, and they were pushing away the monsters and they took my hand. \n\nThey got me out of the house. \n\nThen they disappeared. \n\nI looked back into the basement of Corey’s house - there was nothing but darkness inside. \n\nBut then, I saw a blue light come to life inside the basement room. \n\nThe game had come back on again, and it was calling me back inside with its siren song…\n\nI was ready to go back in, taking my first steps that way when…\n\nSomeone grabbed me from behind and pulled me away. They drug me all the way back to the sidewalk where they stopped and whispered into my ear:\n\n“Go the fuck home. I won’t help you from here.”\n\nThey let me go and were gone in the night. \n\nI walked home.",

        "text": "My first week as a fire lookout stationed at Fire Tower 14 had started off okay.  All my life I’d wanted to be a park ranger, and now I was within one day of accomplishing that goal.  After this final day of training, I was to be left on my own.\n\nBut something catastrophic had [happened,](\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11qdr8t/i_was_hired_as_a_fire_lookout_theres_something/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n) derailing all of those plans.  \n\nAfter seeing two separate fires burning in the distance, my supervisor and I had set off in our Jeep to check out what we assumed were campfires.  He had left me alone to investigate one group of offenders, while he approached the other campsite.  \n\nEverything was going according to plan until I stumbled across a stone archway in the forest that looked very out of place.  On the other side the sky was purple, whereas on our side it was blue.  But I mistook that for the setting sun, or some other phenomena, and pressed onward, going through it.  \n\nI wish I’d trusted my instincts, and stayed on the other side of the arch.  Because now I'm trapped in another world, with no way home.  The archway disappeared, leaving me stranded here.  And I quickly realized I wasn’t alone.  There were creatures in the forest that looked like people but were not.  They had an extra set of arms, for one thing, and they called back to you if you spoke, but they were not human.    \n\nDespite all odds, I’d been rescued by another park ranger right before getting mauled by the bizarre creatures.  This man, who told me his name was Steve, said he had been trapped in this place for a month.  He had a cave which he managed to camouflage with tree branches, allowing us to hide from the creatures after escaping from them.  \n\nSteve knew a lot about this place, and he said the creatures avoided a certain part of the forest - so that was where he took me.  He had set up traps, which only he knew the placement of, and his hideout was there, stocked with provisions.  \n\n“A lot of the plant life here is the same as in our world,” he told me when we arrived back at his camp.  “I found a patch of shitake mushrooms and I’ve been surviving on those more or less.  I had a few things in my bag - an energy bar, some trail mix, y’know, the usual stuff - but I ran out of that pretty quickly.”\n\nHe showed me his little pile of foraged food and I marveled at how well prepared he was.  There were different species of mushrooms, some wild root vegetables, and some ruffage he’d set aside to make a salad with.     \n\n“This is incredible,” I said.  “And I thought I was a good survivalist.”\n\n“You’re still young,” he told me.  “I’ve been doing this sort of thing for a long time.  I was in the British Special Air Services when I was younger.  They’re highly trained soldiers - sort of like your Special Forces.  Since I got across the pond I’ve worked here and there, but most recently I’ve been the fire lookout at Tower 14 for almost ten years.”\n\nI let out a soft gasp.  \n\n“That’s where I’m stationed.  You worked at Tower 14?”\n\nHe chuckled.  \n\n“Worked.  Past tense.  Damn.  Those bastards replaced me already, eh?  Well, I guess they must have given up looking for me too, then.”\n\nI thought back to that odd look Ross had given me when letting me out of the Jeep.  He looked like he was going to say something, but maybe, “Don’t get killed or disappear like the last guy,” would have been too on the nose.\n\nMaybe he’d been thinking about how this was a bad idea, I realized.  Maybe he was thinking we should go together.  But instead he’d let me go alone.  \n\nI felt a twinge of anger, thinking about how none of this would have happened if Ross had been shadowing me like he was supposed to be.\n\n“They’re still looking for you,” I said, not really knowing if that was true.  “I’m sure they are.  They wouldn’t just forget about you.  Ross didn’t get around to telling me yet, that’s all.  I’m still in training.”\n\nI didn’t add that this was my last day of training.  Or that news of David's disappearance seemed to have been purposefully omitted from my orientation. \n\nDavid eyed me suspiciously, but didn’t say another word about it.  \n\n“I was going out to look for more mushrooms when I spotted you.  It’s too dangerous to go out again tonight, but tomorrow we’ll check for the archway again and I’ll show you the shitake grove.  I go back to that same spot every day and look for that arch.  I can’t believe I missed it.”\n\nHe was peeling a mushroom with his knife as he spoke, but with that last sentence he hurled the blade across the room where it clanged against the rock wall, making a loud noise.  \n\n“Quiet!” I whisper-yelled at him.  “I know you’re upset but we’re gonna get out of here.”\n\nHis face was emotionless as he looked back at me, tears welling up in his eyes.  \n\n“That’s what I’ve been telling myself for the last thirty-six days,” he said.  “I hope to God you’re right.”\n\n*\n\nAs I tried to fall asleep that night, I couldn’t.  The idea of a man like David being brought to tears by this place was almost too much to bear.  The man was a killing machine.  British Special Forces.  He had saved my life and pulled me out of a situation where I’d thought I would be dead for sure.  \n\nAt least we had more ammunition, now.  And two guns.  Still, that didn’t reassure me very much.  \n\nThose creatures, whatever they were, did not like to die.  \n\n*\n\nI managed a few hours of off and on sleep before the sun came up, still appearing that same horrible shade of purple as it had the day prior.  It was starting to hurt my head.  It felt wrong just being in this place, like we didn’t belong here.  Like the air was too thick and too heavy, not meant for me to breathe.  \n\nWithout even realizing it, I had begun to hyperventilate.  I tried to stop myself, to calm myself down, but was unable to.  \n\nDavid came over and looked in my eyes, and after a while I started to hear the words he was saying.  The cave was still beginning to turn darker and darker all around me, and I could feel myself losing consciousness, but I managed to listen to him.  \n\n“Breathe deep,” he said.  “Slow it down.  You’re okay.  I’ve lived here this long.  The air is breathable.  You’re okay.  Big, deep breaths, lad.  Good.  Okay, that’s better.  Keep breathing, in and out.”\n\nAfter a while I started to calm down, and looked at him gratefully.  \n\n“Thanks,” I said.  “I needed that.”\n\n“Stay there and get your wits about you.  I’ve got breakfast ready,” he said, and I realized he had a portion of mushrooms and wild lettuce set aside for me.  He brought it over on a flat rock and handed the food to me.  \n\n“What’s the plan,” I asked, eyeing the food suspiciously.  Despite the fact that he said it was okay, I was still concerned.  \n\n“Eat,” he told me.  “You need your energy.  We’re gonna walk over to the shitake patch.  On the way, we’ll check for the arch.  On the way back, we’ll check again.  That’s all we can really do.  It’s not safe lingering out there for too long.  Those things - they can smell us.”\n\nI managed to eat a bit of the salad and mushrooms, despite the fact that they made me uneasy.  Consuming anything, even the air, in this world, felt wrong.  Like I was breathing in toxic fumes not meant for human consumption.  Still, a little bit of food couldn’t hurt me.  At least, that’s what I told myself.  \n\nAfter eating, we set out for the archway.  \n\nThe hike was a long one, and David brought plenty of water and provisions, filling up our canteens from a spring along the way.  Once again, I felt glad for his guidance.  If not for him, I’d probably be dead ten times by now.  \n\nAfter a long while we reached the clearing where the arch had been.  Once again, it wasn’t there.  The spot where it had been was empty, but we wandered over to it anyway.  \n\n“How can it just disappear?  Be here one day and gone the next?” I asked.  \n\nDavid shook his head.  \n\n“How can any of this be possible?  I wouldn’t have believed it if someone told me.  Would you?”\n\nI thought about that for a few seconds.  \n\n“No, probably not.  I’d think they were crazy.  Or high.  Or maybe both.”\n\n“And yet, here we are.  Defying all rational common sense.”\n\nThere wasn’t much more to say, so we continued walking.  \n\nI tried desperately to ignore the feeling that I heard the sounds of rustling leaves behind us.  As if someone were following quietly, and at a distance.  Every time I looked back, there was no one there.\n\n*\n\nEventually we reached the shitake patch. David told me to start picking the mushrooms quickly, before the creatures found us.  He said they were smart, and would send out scouts.  So once they knew where we were, more would be gathered together and they would come back to hunt us like pack animals.  \n\nThe worst part was, they knew this was a favorite spot of his, so they would be ready for him.  \n\nAfter a few short minutes of gathering mushrooms, David told me to wrap up.  \n\n“Let’s go,” he said.  “There’s no more time.”\n\nDespite my fear I couldn’t believe what he was saying.  We had just started.  It had been such a long hike, and this small amount of mushrooms would barely sustain us for a day.  \n\n“Come on, David,” I said.  “A few more minutes.”\n\n“I said, let’s go!” he hissed at me, his face morphing into one of rage.  \n\nI almost didn’t recognize him.  His color changed, going red, almost purple.  And there was something else strange too.  His chest seemed to spasm when he was angry.  The fabric puffed in and out in a very odd way, like he was breathing much too fast.  \n\nHe caught me looking at him and calmed down slightly, then came over to me and grabbed my arm, dragging me away from the mushroom patch.\n\n“I can see one.  It’s a little ways away, at six o’clock.  That means there’s more.  We need to start walking fast.  Don’t run yet.  Don’t look.  Don’t let them know we saw them.”\n\nAll of this he said while dragging me away from the mushroom patch, and I fought the urge to glance over my shoulder.  But I did hear the distinct sound of movement now, coming closer, gaining on us steadily.  \n\n“Do you hear that,” I asked, my heart pounding faster, my throat dry, my knees shaking.  \n\n“Quiet,” he whispered angrily.  \n\nI was silent for a few short seconds, and the noises came closer, and closer.  \n\n“RUN!” he screamed, and I began to bolt as fast as I could through the trees.  \n\nA second later, I heard them all around us.  They had surrounded us.  They’d been waiting.  \n\n“Your gun!” David screamed from behind me, and I tried to get it ready while still running.  \n\nThen I saw what he was worried about - one of the creatures was straight ahead - waiting for us partially hidden behind a tree.  It revealed itself just barely, poking its head out to look and see how far off we were, then it disappeared again.  \n\n“You see it?” he shouted.  \n\n“Yeah!” \n\n“When we get to that tree, you go left, I go right!  Don’t get too close!”\n\nI understood immediately what he was doing.  He was sacrificing himself for me.  By going to the right, he was running right through the eyeline of the creature.  He would be running past it within inches of its grasp.  All to distract it so it wouldn’t get me.  \n\nPart of me wanted to argue, but there was no time.  We were already at the tree.  I ran to the left and David went right.  The creature lunged at him, just as I’d feared, and managed to rake him with its long talon-like fingernails.  His back was bloodied as he ran, getting ahead of me as he put on speed.  \n\n“There’s more up ahead,” he yelled.  And I saw them a second later.  \n\nThere were at least two, maybe more.  Hiding in the trees and waiting for us a little ways ahead.  I had a feeling they would not be fooled as easily as the last one.  \n\nLuckily we had a speed advantage on the creatures.  At least the ones we’d come across so far.  I hated to think what a faster version of these things would look like.  Our ability to outrun them was the only thing keeping us alive.  I could hear them chasing after us, their heavy footsteps loud as they crushed the leaves underfoot.\n\n“Let’s split up,” David said.  “You go left, I’ll go right.  Then we meet back in the middle, say a hundred paces from here.  Got it?”\n\n“Sure,” I agreed, not sure what other options we had.  I was deferring to him, since he seemed to know what he was doing.  \n\n“Now!” he yelled, and branched off from our trajectory, heading to the right.  At the same time, I went left.  \n\nThe creatures took a moment to respond, but once they saw what we were doing, they left their hiding spot where they were waiting to ambush us.  The creature closest to me came at me from my right and I screamed as it came within a few feet of me, its horrifying arms reaching out to grab me.  \n\nI felt the breeze from its hand rushing past, but managed to duck out of the way just in time, stumbling over a fallen log and face-planting right afterwards.  The thing crawled after me and I felt it grab my ankle, pulling me towards it as I screamed.  \n\nKicking as hard as I could with my other leg, I brought my foot up into the creature's jaw, where it connected with a sickening crunch.  It howled a cry of hurt anger as its grip loosened on my ankle for a split second.  \n\nI attempted to wrench myself free but it held on tightly.  The thing was strong!\n\nI was about to kick it again when it grabbed my other leg and began to crawl in towards my face.  Its oversized eyes widened with anticipation, drool pouring out over its lower lip.  \n\nThe thing was about to eat me.\n\nAs it unhinged its jaw like a python about to consume a deer, I remembered the rifle slung across my back.  The thing darted its head forward toward my neck, as if to start its meal with my jugular.  \n\nThe rifle was caught underneath my bodyweight.  I was trying to rock side to side to pull it free while simultaneously shoving the thing away from me with my knees, kicking and bucking and doing anything I could to weasel my way out from its grasp.  \n\nJust as its teeth were about to snap shut around my windpipe, I managed to free the rifle.  \n\nUsing all of my strength, I pulled my knees back and kicked the creature in its chest, sending it reeling backwards for half an instant.  \n\nJust enough time for me to get a shot off.  \n\nBOOM!\n\nThe blast echoed through the forest, exploding outwards from the barrel of my rifle.  \n\nOne moment the creature was there in front of me, the next its head was gone - replaced by a bloody crater jettisoning blood from the ruined remains of the creature's visage.\n\nI scrambled to my feet and ran, not looking back.\n\nAfter a long, harrowing run through the forest, I met up with David again.  He looked even worse for wear than before.  \n\nWhereas I had gotten away cleanly, he had been mauled by one of the creatures, just barely escaping with his life.  He was bloodied and had gashes on his neck, his forehead, and both of his arms from defensive wounds.  \n\nWorst of all, he lost his gun in the process, and now we were down to only one weapon for defense.  And half the ammo. \n\nEventually we arrived back at the cave, after a long run through the forest, barely escaping with our lives.  \n\nDavid was in rough shape, and I helped him lay down on his bedroll.  I went outside to find leaves or whatever possible to patch up his wounds, in the absence of bandages.  I had a small first aid kit with me as well, which I brought everywhere, but it wasn’t nearly enough for the injuries he’d sustained.  \n\nI cleaned his wounds and packed the worst of them with gauze from my first aid kit, then wrapped them with long leaves from the forest.  \n\nDavid began pushing me away when I went to unbutton his shirt, to tend to the wounds on his back.  I told him to calm down, but he wouldn’t stop resisting me.  Eventually I relented and told him to deal with the cuts himself.  They wouldn’t heal properly if he didn’t do something about them.  But he just closed his eyes and drifted off to sleep, the blood running from his wounds leaking out onto the rock floor of the cavern while he snored.  \n\n*\n\nFor the second night in a row, I couldn’t sleep.  I kept thinking about David and his injuries.  He would be dead by morning if I didn’t do something.  There was too much blood loss.  I couldn’t understand why someone with his level of experience wasn’t taking this seriously.  Was he delirious?  \n\nSuddenly his snoring stopped.  The cave was dead quiet and still in the darkness of the night.  \n\nAnd then I heard a sound like rocks being moved.  A shuffling of feet.  Bones creaking and cracking.  \n\nThere was a wet, sloppy sound.  Smacking lips and rending flesh.  Someone pulling meat from bone and tearing gristle with sharp incisors.  \n\nI peered into the darkness of the cave, looking in the direction of the sound, and my eyes slowly began to adjust.  \n\nDavid was up.  He was eating something in the corner of the dark cave.  It looked like… Was it moving?  A rat?  Or a squirrel?\n\nHe tore another bite of flesh from the writhing thing which had been moving in his grasp, and suddenly it was still again.  The only sound was of him chewing.  \n\nMy eyes adjusted further, my heart pounding rapidly.  \n\nDavid’s shirt was off.  He had treated his wounds after all.  In the darkness when I’d been trying to sleep, my eyes closed, he had been busy dealing with his injuries.\n\nAnd I realized why he hadn’t wanted me to see beneath his clothes. \n\nIt all made sense suddenly.  The twitching beneath his shirt when he got upset.  The way his color changed when he was angry.  His face had turned red.  Almost purple, like the sky.  \n\nAnd beneath his shirt was the most obvious change of all.  \n\nHe took another large bite of whatever it was he’d found scurrying in the cave.  And with his FOUR quickly-moving hands, he pulled flesh from the bones and crammed more of the creature into his mouth.\n\nHis eyes were golden and reflective when they caught me staring at him in the darkness.  \n\nAnd as I got to my feet I began to [run.](https://youtu.be/5V3obVKO4xA)  \n\n[JG](https://www.reddit.com/r/JGcreepypastas/comments/zpi8zt/master_story_list_updated_regularly/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[TCC]https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)\n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11qdr8t/i_was_hired_as_a_fire_lookout_theres_something/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)",

        "text": "([Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/wi22mj/i_took_a_road_trip_with_my_friends_but_they/))\n\nI don’t know how long has it been, I lost track of time, it could have been only minutes, hours or days, i don’t really know, but one thing I am sure of: the moon still stares at me like an ominous glowing eye on the foggy sky, I've seen the roots given to me dry and rot on the floor of this cage, i witnessed the villein walk endlessly near me, my nails are big enough for me to try to claw my way out of this hellhole, but they are not strong enough, I'm not strong enough. It seems days have passed, maybe weeks? Heavens, I don't know, but the moon stands still. I’ve always found comfort in the night, but this is something different, this isn’t the night, this is darkness itself. This place is cursed.\n\nThe last thing I saw before they locked me up in this ditch was the dead body of my girlfriend lying in the mud, with a stare as blank as the moon itself being bathed in the guts of my friend’s boyfriend as he tried to escape. It was quick. He fell lifeless on top of her and without delay they threw their body in the well. After that I lost all hope, all of my friends were dead, my wife was dead and soon, hopefully, so would I be. I’m too coward to do it myself, I can't find means to escape so they can butcher me like they did with the others. I tried starving myself to death but the moon is my witness that this damned place just won’t let me die. I can’t kill myself, I can’t dream, I can’t scream and I couldn’t save them.\n\nThe thoughts of injuring myself and bleeding to death were starting to come back, just before I heard the door creak. But this time no one came through, no spoiled food, no blank stares, no one. I waited for a few minutes before getting up. “Is this a dream?” No, it couldn’t be, every night I tried to sleep I would wake up seconds after covered in sweat, this is real. I opened the door just a little more so I could stick my head out, and I saw it.\n\nEvery single one of them was looking at the sky, their eyes reflecting the moonlight as bright as ever. I heard a soft murmur coming from them but I was not willing to stay and find out, the time is now, this is my chance. I rushed on all fours to the nearest tree stump and quickly began to crawl my way through the dirt. I was sleeping in my own shit, the mud was a soothing welcome on my skin. I don’t know exactly where i was in the village, all of the houses looking the fucking same, all of the houses looked the same! I had to think, even if I managed to enter the woods I could not see anything in front of me if it were not for the moon, my car was totaled, I didn’t have my radio or my cell phone. If I could only find the well, I could go to my friend’s corpse and grab the radio. If I were lucky maybe he had something on him… I couldn't bear to touch his body in that state at that moment… I don't know even if I will have the guts to do it now.\n\nI didn’t know what the fuck was going on but they were still looking up, whispering, I don’t care what was that, I was sick of it, running crouched made my legs start to hurt like hell, and when I noticed I was sprinting behind the houses, In the distance I saw the well and the house the corpse of my friend were, the adrenaline in my veins made me ignore everything they were not fast, they couldn’t catch me now. Rushing through the open field I felt a gust of wind bring to me the smell of rotten flesh and for the first time I was happy that death was welcoming me. The busted door was still on the ground making the entrance easy for me, I threw myself on the ground and without even checking out I started to stick my hand on the carcass. I had nothing in my stomach to vomit, I had no time to waste and nothing to lose anymore.\n\nAll I could find was a small flashlight and a shiv that was nailed to his rib cage, better than nothing. I was starting to make my way out when I noticed behind me a shadow blocking the moonlight, and I knew that it wasn't a cloud. Screaming I got up turning my body with the shiv in my hands aiming for whatever was behind me and I hit an old man in the neck. Making a rattling sound I saw the moonlight in his eyes fade away as I dropped him on the carcass and rushed out of the house. One more time all eyes were on me as they started to slowly walk towards the house I was on. “Not this time.” I don't know where I found the strength to go on, but no matter who stood before me, I was killed. I killed them like an animal, I screamed from the top of my lungs, they needed to pay for what they did to me, to us!\n\nI let the rage consume me and that was my undoing. I started to feel exhausted and I realized I hadn't escaped yet, I didn't even try to run. My hatred for them lured me into the mouth of a trap, I was near the well and they were swarming around me muttering more of that nonsense. But it felt good. Damn, did it feel good. I didn’t care what would welcome me in the afterlife, I had my taste of revenge and I knew they would kill me for it.\n\n“WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU WAITING FOR, COME ON!”\n\nI shouted as they began to approach and reach out for me, I thought I was ready. I was not. Fear began to poison me where the rage once was. I struck the shiv in the shoulder of the first that touched me but soon they grabbed my arms and I couldn't fight anymore. I was desperate, they began to push me down against the well as I struggled to free myself, their whisper was inside my head, I thought I was going crazy as I saw the moon blink at me. I faltered, they lifted me on the edge of the well and started to push me in. I begged for them to release me, I begged for mercy, I humiliated myself and once again I couldn't do anything. I was ready to die, to meet my friends, but not like this.\n\nI fell, I tried to grab the wall of the well that tried to devour me with its void only to break the nails out of my finger making me scream in pain, I realized halfway through that this is what I wanted, wasn’t it? I closed my eyes welcoming death for the second time and I hit the water on the bottom. Death abandoned me once again. But luckily for me, I wasn’t alone down there.",

        "text": "**Reptilia** \\- or **Reptiles** as we call them - are a major fixation of mine.\n\nAt least, they were at one point. I mean, I still fixate on them; but the past was enjoyable. The past actually had meaning, comfort. I don't want to think about it anymore; but the thoughts, the factoids, the images, they won't leave my head.\n\nNot too long ago, my boyfriend - let's call him Milo - had increased anxiety for a couple months since a mugging incident; he was stressed moreso than normal, with the times he felt safe only around me. It got so bad I had to go everywhere with him so he could do the simplest tasks; within due time, it became draining. I loved him to pieces, but his need to go everywhere with me - even if it was three minutes away from our apartment - was too much. But we didn't want to end things over this; this wasn't his fault. I wanted to help him in any way I could.\n\nFrom there I got the idea of an emotional support animal; the way one helped me through childhood, I'll never forget it. But here's the kicker; Milo was allergic to pet dander. He couldn't get a cat; he couldn't get a dog. He had a fear of rodents, and birds weren't his forte.\n\nYou can guess what species I recommended.\n\nWe decided on a leopard gecko, as they're the best choice for beginners. I told him everything I knew, my go-to for supplies and adoption, and I'd help him out if he needed it. There weren't many pet stores near our apartment; the other stores were more than twenty minutes away, and we didn't have time to go farther than our city thanks to our schedules.\n\nAnd then he bought the crickets. Milo made the trip himself; I was proud of him for getting motivation, believing the pet gave him motivation to start out. He seemed a bit shaken once he got home; but not from the trip, from the crickets.\n\nLeopard geckos only eat live insects; mealworms are a common snack for them amongst other worms, and the occasional dubia roach is a good alternative, but crickets were a common delicacy. You've seen pet store crickets; feeder crickets roaming around tanks when certain lizards are too full or don’t want to bother. They're a light brown, small-to-medium in size. These feeder crickets were...different. These crickets resembled smaller feeders; same shape, same usual size. They were black as night, like a common black field cricket, and on the occasion, you could see spots of black droplets.\n\n\"Oh, god,\" I muttered. “You went to the place I told you about, right??”\n\n\"Of course I did,” Milo retaliated. “The clerk told me they were safe, but…”\n\nI paused for a minute; a reason I hoped would explain why they were this way popped into my head; “Maybe they’re trying to breed field crickets with feeders?”\n\n\"Whatever it is, I can't go back; they were the only shipment they had.\"\n\nIn his room sat a three-year-old rescue Mack snow leopard gecko, sleeping until our staring startled it awake. It seemed pure white, with its spotted patterning resembling chunks of coal sitting in the snow. It noticed the bag of crickets; his stance lowered at the sight of food. \n\nAs I took the cricket keeper, Milo popped open the bag of crickets; a rancid smell filled the room. Feeder crickets stink when you open their bag, it’s a common occurrence. But these crickets smelled like a mix of ammonia and rotting meat. Milo's room wasn't the cleanest, so the stench made his room even grimier than usual. Nausea hit our noses and stomachs; no matter how far I stood - I had to leave the room once to make sure I didn't throw up all over my boyfriend's bed sheets - the smell stunk through the whole apartment. Once he managed to put the crickets in the container, the stench got so bad we had to grab our pets and stay out for a while, spraying the apartment with air fresheners and filling Milo's room with fans facing his window. \n\nTenants passing must’ve thought we looked mad; Milo held a leopard gecko as it stared into space, while I had a crested gecko and chameleon on my shoulders and an iguana in my arms like a crazy lizard man.\n\nOnce the air cleared up, Milo realized he forgot to close the container from the rush of the stench. We expected an apartment full of loose, chirping crickets; but none of them escaped. They sat there, spacing out and hiding in their egg carton pieces, as if they were waiting for our return. Bits of fresh, cannibalized crickets sat on the plastic glass.\n\nAs Milo grabbed a cricket with the plastic tweezers, it squished through the grip; a liquid seeped through, escaping the insect as it dripped onto the wooden floor, ammonia-like scents and a ‘squelch’ emitting through the room. The stomach area is squishy and grimy, like a gummy bear; but even the legs seemed to squish a bit with the stomach. Cricket legs don’t squish when obtained with tweezers; they’re sturdy enough to the point where ripping out the leg would include the meat connecting it. But this one…this one’s legs churned and squashed with the impact of the squeezing.\n\nBut the head is what caught me off-guard. It continued to move as if nothing was wrong, chirping and not bothering trying to squirm away from the tight grip held upon its body; no flailing, no attempts to escape. Its antennae twitched and its head turned as it stared straight at Milo and I, its eyes empty.\n\n“Is there anywhere else to go for feeders?” Milo stared at me with desperation.\n\nAll I could do was observe the cricket my boyfriend held between pinching sticks; “If there was, I think I would have said something by now.”\n\nMilo dropped the cricket into the lizard’s container, more liquid dripping into the tank carpeting. The gecko studied the cricket; eyes widened, throat sac speed increased, and tail wagging in the form of a snake slithering activated inside the reptile, preparing to pounce.\n\n\"Wait,\" Milo spoke up. \"This doesn't feel right, I-\"\n\nBut the leopard gecko struck. The cricket never tried to squirm; it wasn't dead or swallowed all the way yet, but it didn’t even bother to try to escape either. It let the liquid from its body emit from the leopard gecko’s mouth as the reptile, in haste, licked its lips as if it was a sort of reptilian nectar.\n\nWe’d be a cheeky bunch in a normal situation, cheering and watching in awe as the reptiles ate and struck insects; feeding my lizards was like a dad watching a football game. But all we could do was watch as the gecko paced out and resumed back to its den to sleep, more liquid dripping out; it refused to eat more for the day.\n\nThe gecko ate it the correct way, not even flinching or showing hesitation, choking, or disgust; but the way the cricket acted, moved, had no effect or reaction to getting eaten…was it diseased? Dying? Did we give our gecko a diseased insect?\n\nThroughout the week the gecko was starving, glass surfing and acting as if it hadn't been fed in days, despite its constant consumption of crickets. When Milo or I weren't able to give it a cricket in a certain amount of time, it would seize out, stopping once a cricket landed into its tank. It ate one a day, then two after another day, then three, then four. No matter how many times Milo or I called the pet store, they only had those crickets. It got to the point where I could hear one of the employees yelling through the phone to stop whining.\n\nAt one point we even had to go to a vet; the gecko was fine. Nothing was wrong during those days; it was healthy, happy, and acted normal until we put it back in its tank; and from there, the seizing started back up.\n\nAnd about a week later, a crash and a thump emitted from the apartment that night.\n\nI’m a rather deep sleeper; not even the loudest noises could get me up. But when this noise echoed through our halls…something was wrong. I grabbed a flashlight, forcing myself out of bed to combat any paranoia planning to implant me to my mattress. My door leads to a straight line to our small living room; you'd be greeted with memorial pictures of my reptiles throughout the years on the walls. There in the hall laid broken photographs and claw marks; faint, fountain pen-esque claw marks, sharp enough to make tears into both the walls *and* the photographs, with strikes reaching interior wood. \n\nTo the left of the path halfway through the hall, you'd spot the kitchen. The kitchen was a complete mess, having also been scratched, torn, and ripped apart from wall to wall, drawer to drawer, shelf to shelf. The fridge was the safest culprit of the attack; it wasn’t raided, but those sharp claw marks scratched the front of the fridge as cool air danced on my skin. Despite the fridge being clean, the bug traps weren't; large scales stuck to the sticky contraptions, sharp and pointed, as if something was trying to eat the dead bugs. Closer to the end of the hallway on the right was Milo's room; the glow of faint lights from the outdoors leaked into the hallways; a normal occurrence, as he likes to leave a creak open. For the most part, he's quiet at night; but my ears perked as i overheard a soft, quick shuffle from within, thinking nothing of it.\n\nAnd from there stood the living room; frames hung clawed memorials, the roof held tall, dangling bug traps with scrapped mouth scales, the couch had shredded pillows, and tail marks indented into the walls. But those were material objects; they could be replaced, and paintings – even if their original counterpart’s meaning would be lost – could be repainted. What broke my heart the most in that moment though were from my reptilian containers. \n\nMy crested gecko lay dead on its enclosure floor, back broken from an impactful fall; the water from its dripper released small drops into its open, gaped mouth. Nearby, sticks and fake vines from my chameleon’s enclosure scattered across the floor as more glass shards danced around them; A stick from the impact broke the chameleon’s arm. But the one who got it worst of all was my iguana; with arms contorted and disfigured, its head turned to break its neck, and body stepped from a large creature's foot of sorts, it laid stuck to the floor. She stood motionless, at peace as her one open eye looked at me, pupil to pupil connecting.\n\nAll I could do was stare, trapped in this dark, inky room full of glass, tears of wooden splinters, and my deceased pets. I stood confused, terrified, motionless as the sight sunk into me, the night feeling overwhelming as small, ambient noises filled the space.\n\nMilo.\n\nI dropped my flashlight, thoughts racing for being so stupid not checking in on Milo sooner. For god’s sakes, he’s my boyfriend! The intensity of the situation made the adrenaline rush, with the ten second scramble to the door feeling like forever.\n\nI flipped the light switch.\n\nThe Mack snow stood atop Milo's bed; it grew to the point where it almost made a perfect circle around the room. What were once small, cheese-grater type teeth turned into the size of alligator fangs, uneven and dented but still nubby. Its swelling tail leaked drops of fat from its large bumps, having gone from small circles to large mosquito bites; it seemed unphased by its leakage, not even bothering to fix it, let alone look at it. Fingers, which on a leopard gecko looked limp and broken despite being fine, helped the creature lift itself off the ground, contorting and moving on their own as if they were eels. The same smell and mess from the crickets Milo bought seeped through its mouth, a stench I could once again smell from afar with an open door. Its eyes, as black as the crickets were, boggled out of its head, falling out and dangling on the occasion but being pushed back in thanks to its tongue.\n\nAnd right in front of me - right god damn there - the gecko was eating Milo from the head up, making small bites and sucks like it would as if it were to eat a cricket or mealworm. Milo wasn’t moving; he seemed stuck, the illusion of leg kicking and squirming through the sides of my eyes whenever I had to turn away; but whenever I was able to look, his movement was nonexistent. I shook Milo's leg without thinking; the leopard gecko emitted a terrifying screech, revealing – in its mouth – a half-eaten torso of Milo, the small crocodile-like teeth having made imprints.\n\nIt didn’t move. It didn’t bother to strike. All it wanted to do first was eat, and eat, and eat everything in the small apartment it could consider food, evident by bug traps; but not until it finished its first meal, a meal similar a baby mouse of only a few days. I stood motionless with the lizard, glancing at a pocket knife on Milo's dresser and grabbing it with hesitation; I didn’t want to do this. This reptile was supposed to help Milo's anxiety; this was supposed to be the creature I could treasure with the person I loved the most. My grip on the end of the knife tightened; the leopard gecko, distorted and monstrous, stared at me with fingers moving like eels, the appendages crawling towards me. My own fixation being against me – as if it had ever favored me – felt like a stab in the back, a painful twist of cruel fate, as if this was all my fault.\n\nThe moon faded into the rising day as a familiar screech echoed through the apartment that night.\n\nNow I’m temporarily staying with my brother; of course he doesn’t believe a giant, mutated leopard gecko killed my boyfriend, but who would? Not like I told him, let alone going to tell anybody; he damn thing shriveled up after the blade hit, wincing from a giant monster, to a normal gecko, to ashes and dust. Ever since those events, reptiles are all I can think about, moreso than normal; those events, that night, and the never-rending thoughts of reptile factoids and information gathering around like a vortex. The pet store I went to did shut down due to bad business; whatever the hell happened to those crickets, I’ll never know. It’s only been a few days since the incident, but eventually they’ll find Milo’s body; it’s still out there, in the open, unable to be hidden and waiting for someone to come, for the police to arrive, asking me questions on if I did it or not.\n\nThey’d never believe it was those damn crickets.",

        "author": "AliceSpider",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11ryx8d/blood_cichlids/",
        "text": " TW: &gt;!Self harm, Blood!&lt;\n\nMy dear friend Tara loved aquariums. She had 3 tanks when I first met her, which became 5 a year later. She was happy to spend her free time feeding, cleaning, and water testing. All of her friends, including myself, saw that the hobby brought her joy. She was elated when talking about her tetras, gleeful to mention her Corydoras, excited to share the latest news of her pea puffers.\n\nThat all changed, when she adopted the Blood Cichlids. They were a bright orange-red, she’d bought them from an aqua-swap website. These weren’t normal cichlids. They were the brightest red I've ever seen in nature, and Tara agreed. \n\nCichlids are aggressive, so her most recent additions lived in their own tank. The first few weeks were normal, Tara seemed especially happy, as was the usual when she assembled a new fish tank.\n\nSoon I began to notice something was wrong. Tara was still happy, but exhausted. She had been staying up most of the night to watch the Cichlids, and began to miss Thursday trivia night.\n\n“Louis, have you ever loved something so much you’d sacrifice yourself?” she said to me. Of course I said yes. My little sister passed away when I was 9, I loved her that much and more. People always talk about their harrowing childhoods, but I never did. Sarah and I were raised by a single mother, who passed away after a drug overdose. That’s all I would ever share, even with Tara. I thought my friend had perhaps lost a grandparent or another family member. \n\n“My Cichlids… they’re so beautiful… I worry every time I'm away that something horrible will happen to them”.\n\nI tried my best to sympathize with her, but she’d never shown this level of concern for any of her other fish. She handled it surprisingly well when her eldest cory passed, it surprised me that her perfectly healthy Cichlids could cause her such anxiety.\n\nTara and I both worked at the same crappy Italian restaurant, and that week she didn’t show up. Despite my pleas, our grubby boss fired her after the 5th day. She was still alive, and sent me texts once in a while. They were all pictures of the Blood cichlids. Even when I asked her about Nana the pea puffer, she would only speak of the cichlids. \n\nAfter a few weeks of not having a job, Tara seemed to be unconcerned. She hadn’t even applied for anything else. We had a video chat, and I could tell she was losing weight. Tara was already quite thin, unlike my chubby self, she didn’t need to, and couldn’t afford to lose those pounds. \n\nI came to her apartment that week to discover her cabinets filled with fish food. There was nothing left for Tara other than a few cereal boxes, and no milk. Just as upsetting was the state of her other fish tanks. While the Cichlid’s tank was pristine, the 5 other aquariums she owned had become overrun with algae. Even without much experience in the fishkeeping world, I could tell several of her other pets had severe fin rot.\n\nIn the past this would have sent Tara into a frenzy, starting up her hospital tank like a getaway car.\n\nOne of her tetras was clearly dead, floating on the surface. From the looks of the fungus growing on its body, it had been a few days since it passed.\n\nI sat Tara down and told her that as a friend, I was convinced she needed to seek therapy. I offered to buy her groceries for the week. To say I was concerned for her is an understatement. Tara seemed shocked that I would imply anything was wrong. She accepted the groceries, and allowed me to bury her dead Tetra. \n\nI have a tendency to sympathize with mental health issues like depression, having faced those same challenges myself. Tara’s condition terrified me. The neglect and obsession was so far beyond anything I'd seen before. Despite my many text messages, the only response I received from my friend was “Thanks for coming over. Few more random fish died, Cichlids are good though! I named the big one Rosie!”.\n\n3 weeks passed until the next time I saw her apartment. Absolutely no human food remained, and barely any fish food. At least 20 dead fish were floating in her tanks, except of course the Cichlid tank. The dead fish had been gone for long enough that huge colonies of fungus, algae, and even worms had swarmed to their carcasses. \n\nTara sat before the Cichlids, waiting on a water test. She looked emaciated, and hollow. She flashed me a wide, unsettling smile. “Look at my Cichlids! How healthy and bright they are! Have you ever seen a Blood cichlid that looks just like blood?”\n\nIt was true, I hadn't. Her 3 Cichlids were the exact color of a fresh wound. They seemed healthy and well fed, a far cry from her other neglected tanks. Rosie, the largest, had eyes that seemed to follow me around the room. Not curiously or accusingly, hungry. \n\nIt was at this point I contacted Tara’s mother. It didn’t take much detective work to find her, but it took 2 days to see a response. Her mother explained that they had a low-contact relationship. It wasn’t uncommon for Tara’s family to go months without a peep from her.\n\nWhen i brought up the Cichlids, her mother did mention Tara’s lifelong love for aquariums. She recalled how Tara wailed and wept every time she lost a fish.\n\nI knew something was terribly wrong, Tara hadn’t shed a single tear for the 27 fish she’d lost on my last visit. \n\nI rushed to my friend’s house. I have a lot of trouble making connections with people, but when I do, I'm dedicated to supporting them. Over the years I'd known her, Tara had become like a little sister to me. She even looked like Sarah, or at least how I would imagine her full grown.\n\nThe house was locked, and Tara wasn’t answering her phone. I fetched her spare key from under a garden gnome, and unlocked her door. \n\nBlood was everywhere. The kitchen, the living room, her bedroom. I found Tara hunched over her most prized tank, her wrists sliced wide open. As the blood dripped into the aquarium, the Cichlids were eating it like fish flakes. \n\nThe ambulance arrived just in time to save her. As I left for the hospital to await my friend’s fate, I saw that her 5 other tanks no longer contained living fish. There was no food of any kind left in her kitchen. Gazing on her stick thin body, it was apparent she hadn’t eaten since the last time I bought her groceries. \n\nDuring the 7 weeks Tara spent being poked, prodded, and eventually institutionalized, I cared for her fish. All of her tanks had been neglected and decimated, aside from the Cichlids, who were as healthy as ever. I gave her other fish the proper burial she hadn’t. \n\nI carefully dropped the fish flakes into her last remaining aquarium, but to my surprise the Cichlids seemed wholly uninterested. They only consumed the flakes after 3 days. The look in their eyes, so very hungry.\n\nOver this time, I began to see the wonder Tara had seen. 3 Cichlids of blood red, so bright and magnificent. They seemed to gaze directly at me, wondering when Tara would return.\n\nAt week 6, I realized the fish flakes would not satisfy them. \n\nI tried in vain to steady my hand as I carefully sliced the tip of my finger into the tank.\n\nSwirling vortexes surrounded the piece of flesh that had once been my ring finger. The Cichlids wasted no time. They consumed the blood, flesh and bone within minutes. I didn’t even feel the pain, how wonderful it was to give life to such beautiful creatures.\n\nOnly days later Tara was released from the hospital, with many assurances the previous incident was accidental. She’d simply slipped while cutting a dead plant stem from the aquarium, after all, maintenance is essential to a healthy ecosystem.\n\nI knew it was a lie, but since I'm just her friend, I had no legal recourse.\n\nTara was thankful, she hugged me and cried as if I'd saved her life.\n\nI didn’t.\n\nOn the drive back to her apartment, the friend I'd known and loved seemed to be returning.\n\nShe asked about her Corydoras, and I didn't have the heart to tell her every one of them had died. Tara smiled so brightly, hoping I'd have news of Nana, if she’d given birth to baby pea puffers. Once again, I lied. I lied and stated her beloved fish was still pregnant, swimming strongly and ready to burst any day. Nana had died weeks ago from severe ammonia poisoning. By the time I noticed something was wrong, every fish store employee and online forum had told me it was already too late. Only 2 weeks after the incident, I buried her in a local park. \n\nAs we drove closer to the apartment, Tara’s demeanor seemed to change. She demanded news of her Cichlids, and my assurances weren’t enough. My calm and composed friend began shrieking. The ear-piercing sounds progressed into punches, directly to my face. I pulled over a few blocks from our destination, and heaved a sigh of both relief and disbelief as my friend ran from the car at a breakneck pace.\n\nOnly a week later, Tara’s body was discovered. She’d slit her throat, to the point of severing her spinal cord and most of her head. Barely any blood was discovered at the scene, since she’d been hunched over her beloved Blood Cichlids. Their color was even brighter as their keeper’s corpse was hauled away. Temporarily satiated by gallons of Tara’s blood. Her face was unrecognizable, covered in bites, fungus and detritus worms. Nothing remained of her smile, her cheeks, or her eyes. Swarms of white fuzz surrounded the mass of decay that had once been my friend’s head. The body the coroner retrieved could have been anyone, if not for Tara’s signature maroon sweater. \n\nTara was dead, and yet all I could see was my little sister, swaddled in a brown blanket that had once been blue. At the time I was covered in bruises and fecal matter, barely old enough to understand she was gone. One of the paramedics attending to my sister vomited, not because of Sarah, but because of my mother. Dressed in nothing but a white t-shirt, stained crimson, my mother had been dead for 3 weeks. \n\nThis time, the young EMT barfed all over Tara’s corpse. I screamed. Not for Tara, but for her precious fish.\n\nI was barely composed enough to hear the part of Tara’s will that bequeathed her Cichlids to me. At 28 years old, it’s not common practice to ‘get your affairs in order’. I have this hunch, a terrible inkling, that her end may have been purposeful. After all, she’d run out of fish food.\n\nTomorrow morning, I'll be transferring the trio to my home.\n\nWhat amazing, brilliantly colored creatures.",

        "text": "After footage of the doll walking through our apartment went viral, people responded with many sensible suggestions, which I wish I’d followed. Instead, I followed my housemate’s significantly *less* sensible suggestion that we continue to play “Doll in the Hall.” If you’ve never heard of this game (and why should you, given my housemate made it up?), it’s one in which you sew together a doll from socks and human (and hamster) hair and pretend it’s alive a la Elf on the Shelf until eventually, the doll actually *does* come to life—at which point if you’re still playing, *CoNgRaTuLaTiOnS!* You win a Darwin Award, since any possessed doll that actually comes to life is definitely going to remove you from the gene pool!\n\n(In case you’re wondering, *yes,* at the end of the [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11nz6qy/am_i_a_jerk_for_refusing_to_participate_in_my/), the doll did come to life. Because *of course it did.*)\n\nSo, you know, *great.*\n\nBut before we dive into this tragicomedy, *an important update!*\n\nWe found Binky, skittish and shaken but otherwise okay. So, for those of you whose greatest concern during the previous post was entirely for *the hamster* —rest easy, there’s no animal endangerment this time around. We sent her to stay with Karen’s sister. (Do I blame you for being more concerned for a hamster than for me and my fellow humans? No. No, I do not. On this you, I, and Karen are in complete agreement: no one had better mess with our little Binky boo!)\n\n(Not to be confused with Karen’s *other* boo, the ragdoll of nightmares.)\n\nNow.\n\nOnto the Big Bad Boo.\n\n**The Situation:**\n\nIt all started out like a wacky sitcom. Cue title credits for “Boo Boy and Me,” in which the possessed sock doll wanders around the house engaging in increasingly wacky hijinks, to which my housemate Karen is always oblivious, much to the exasperation of yours truly. “I swear, he really moved!” I say, mugging for the camera. \\[insert laugh track\\] These sorts of scenarios are so played out I can’t even watch them on television without groaning—thus I cannot even *begin* to express the frustration of having it play out IRL. I’d complain, “Just kill me now”—but that might be a little too apropos. Nor can I count how many times I lay on the couch with my arm flung dramatically over my face, wondering if I’d lost my marbles and pondering my options: contacting the Catholic church, prayer, exorcism, skipping town and joining a commune in the woods…\n\nFor example:\n\nThe morning after my previous post, I was just grabbing more granola from the pantry when motion in my periphery caught my eye—Boo Boy!\n\nIt came strolling casually out of Karen’s room.\n\n“*Djjjbbbbth*!” I exclaimed as I dropped the granola and pointed, and Boo Boy froze.\n\nKaren looked over and laughed. “Good one, Plato!”\n\n\\[insert laugh track\\]\n\nThis went on for literally *days.* Then on Sunday, I was in the middle of cleaning dishes when Karen’s ear-splitting shriek launched me so high I practically grazed the ceiling. I dropped the plate into the sink and rushed into the living room.\n\nKaren stood with her hands clapped to her mouth.\n\nShe pointed at Boo Boy, frozen in the middle of the floor mid-stride.\n\n“He moved!” she squealed.\n\n“Uh, *yeah*!” I burst. “That’s what I’ve been telling you. This thing is moving. It’s freaky as shit. We should probably destroy it.”\n\n“No!” she squeaked, eyes wide. “He’s our baby!”\n\nOur WHAT now?\n\nShe snatched up the doll.\n\n“Excuse me?” I said. “This is *your* horror baby, not mine, I take no responsibility for—”\n\n“It has your DNA!” At my blank (and growing horrified) stare, she added, “Your hair! And Binky’s! All three of us!”\n\n“Um, okay, first, I’m not sharing maternity rights with a hamster. And secondly—*that thing is not a baby!*”\n\n“Oh my God I have to catch it on video!”\n\n“Karen do you not see how freaky this shit is—”\n\nBut she was already racing to get her phone. Cue interview of me, *again,* verifying what she just observed: Boo Boy, the monster lovechild of two humans and a hamster, strolling around our living room like some sort of discount Chuckie. I was doing dishes when it happened, so I still had my apron on and my best scowl. It was all very domestic. And all so very wrong. I was muttering about how I wish we’d just aborted my button-eyed co-star when Karen enthused, “We should set up cameras with motion sensors! You like science, right? Shouldn’t we science it?”\n\nI *do* like science. But I also like being *alive*. And I especially *dis*like (I have just recently discovered) possessed dolls walking around my home.\n\n“Didn’t you base Boo Boy on some Japanese game where the doll tries to kill you?” I snapped.\n\n“Only if you stab it. You haven’t stabbed him, have you?” At my silence, she burst, “Wait, *you stabbed our baby*?”\n\n“I mean, not *exactly*…” I guiltily explained about cutting its arm off and then sewing it back up.\n\n“Oh. Well, I’m sure Boo Boy understands. Like, if he were to snip off your arm, he’d probably sew it back—”\n\n“Karen—\"\n\n“I’m kidding! Besides, how is a doll going to harm you? He doesn’t even have fingers. He can’t hold anything!”\n\n“Uh, he doesn’t have *muscles* in those little sock legs either, but seems to be ambulating pretty well.”\n\n“C’mon, he hasn’t behaved in any bad way, has he?” She waved him at my face. “This could be huge! Actual evidence of supernatural phenomena! Like, you and I and Boo Boy could change the whole world! We’ll be famous *forever*! And if it gets dangerous, we’ll destroy the doll, I promise! Just three—no, *two* days! We just need video!”\n\nIn the end, I agreed to her request that we continue to allow Boo Boy to wander unrestricted around the house because—and hear me out here—I am an idiot.\n\n**Boo Boy and Me:**\n\nBefore I explain how everything went predictably and horribly awry, a bit more on my motives and methodologies:\n\nOnce upon a time, I was contemplating a career in veterinary medicine. And before anyone questions why I made the incomprehensible decision to switch to philosophy—*no*, it’s not because I enjoy being poor. I’ve mentioned before, I think, my reaction to the sounds of animals yelping in pain? It’s why I noped out of that major and instead into one where I get to ponder such profound questions as, “What is pain?” “How intensely do animals feel pain?” “*Why* must animals feel pain?”… and many other mysteries of the universe I share with customers while also asking, “Would you like fries with that?” (In case you missed [Part One](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11nz6qy/am_i_a_jerk_for_refusing_to_participate_in_my/), these jokes are an obligatory part of my philosophy degree…)\n\nSo anyway, based on my dubious credentials of having finished approximately one tenth of a zoology major, I decided to begin our scientific inquiry with the question:\n\nIs the doll *moving* or *being moved*?—that is, is it *sentient*? Feeling? Reasoning? Before we rush too far along this track—whoa there, let’s not put Descartes before des-horse!\n\n…\n\nNo?\n\nOk, well, moving on. I, a zoologist, know that even the lowliest lifeforms exhibit a reflexive response to pain. You or a fruit fly: yank off one of your limbs and you writhe. Boo Boy does not react to such stimuli, ergo, it is likely that Boo Boy is not of its own volition *moving*, but rather, *is being moved*. And the manipulating force is invisible to the naked eye and thus likely unobservable on the visible light spectrum (making the pet cams I purchased unlikely to capture evidence of it). But we could at least document its manifestation through its manipulation of Boo Boy and potentially other objects (it must have removed the ribbon from my lockbox, for example, and *unlocked* the box—something Boo Boy couldn’t have done from the inside).\n\nI tried sharing my brilliant observations with Karen, but she said she’d leave the “nerd stuff” to me.\n\nAnyway, since I still possessed some vestige of common sense, I told her that, “I’m removing all the knives, scissors, and sharp objects from the house.”\n\nYou know… *just in case.*\n\nAnd now, with the cameras rolling, we recommenced “Doll in the Hall.”\n\nFor science!\n\n**Capturing the Perfect Shot:**\n\nOver the next couple days, Karen and I glimpsed Boo Boy ambling along in the corner of our eyes so often that it became almost… *normal*. We’d catch his diminutive figure trotting in our periphery and turn our heads just in time to see him freeze. It was like a kid playing red light green light, if the kid was a diminutive sack boy with mismatched button eyes. And yet, even though he seemed to be almost constantly in motion (I counted an average of four times an hour), the cameras never seemed to catch him. His movements were always too brief for the motion sensors. Or he moved just outside their range. Often overnight, the cameras got knocked over. One pet cam fell face-down recording the floor, another fell against the window and captured several riveting hours of the shadows of leaves… you get the idea.\n\nI kept a log of Boo Boy’s activities. Most of his movements occurred in the living room, once in a while in the bedrooms or between rooms. Once, we found him in Curt’s room, hiding under the pillow. Karen amusingly scolded him like a small child and told him not to go in there again, “Or you’re grounded!”\n\n\\[insert laugh track\\]\n\nIt was a very good thing Curt was out of town during our little “Boo Boy and Me” sitcom, because he likely would have flipped his lid. In fact it was imperative we wrap up filming before he returned. But when yesterday afternoon we surpassed the two day mark and no footage, by mutual consent, we continued the game.\n\nAnd then—it happened!\n\nKaren was on her phone late last night, doing one of her shoots in her room and talking about Binky (apparently her followers have been hankering for more hamster vids), when she glimpsed Boo Boy and swiveled. She actually videoed him walking *three whole steps*.\n\nIt was the perfect shot.\n\nIt immediately started to go viral.\n\nYou may have noticed, if you tried to search for the video, that it’s gone now. Almost as soon as it started racking up views, it got taken down, and she deleted her account.\n\nWell. More specifically, *I* deleted her account. Because of what happened [next.](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuincyLee/comments/11nxwz3/welcome_thanks_so_much_for_stopping_by/)",

        "text": "around two decades ago, when i was small stood there a diner called “Mitzies Diner”. the diner had been there for years serving customers left and right. but this was no ordinary diner.\n\nthe diner was primarily staffed of just animatronics. these animatronics were mostly as the ‘furry friends down the street.\n\nwhen i was little my parents couldn’t afford to go there often but we went for birthdays and special occasions but soon later the diner had shut down due to the animatronics had rusted and apparently no kid liked them anymore.\n\nfor the last couple years of being a teenager the place had been abandoned and the property had never been sold due to strange occurrences that happened to people who had tried to buy it.\n\nlast week for my 19th birthday i stayed with a friend in my home town. after i moved out, my parents had moved to colorado because they said they’ve always wanted to go.\n\nwhile staying at my friend i noticed the untouched building  of mitzies still standing where i remember. i had been at the car at the time but still i could feel the pull to the building. like something had whispered to my brain that i needed to go inside.\n\nlater during the week my friend went to go have quality time with her boyfriend so i decided i would venture to the abandoned building of the place i once knew as the greatest place on earth.\n\nupon arriving to the building, i soon realized that there was not much security around the building. maybe the building was considered useless or just not important enough to keep safe.\n\nwhen i entered the building, it still had the warm welcoming feeling i had always felt when i arrived at mitzies. looking around already i could see figures all around.\n\nit was dark and the only thing lighting up  room was the thin light coming from my phone. then suddenly on command the power turned on.\n\ni jumped back in fear realizing that the furry friends i had know for so long had looked sad and rusted but still kept the molded smiles on their faces as the fabric on their metal skeletons slowly peeled off.\n\nsoon after i realized that the power had seemingly turned on by itself. i shrugged off the feeling of something watching me come into the building and just played off that power came on due to the motion sensors in the building.\n\ni walked around a bit looking at all the animatronics. i could name them all off in my head. sally the sassy seal, gina the giant giraffe, greg the graying goat, and peter the practical penguin. through the diner there were mini server animatronics that had a tray in their hands at all times.\n\nthese animatronics stood in a line waiting to get their command to serve the meals to the right tables. the servers were also minor characters in this franchise.\n\ntoby turtle, ruby rabbit, and holly horse. i could hear some of them saying their catchphrases they would always say once in a while. phrases like “have a rocking day!” or “eat your food before i do! yum!!”. \n\nthe main cast sat on a stage in the back of the diner. i walked over to see them. the closer i walked the more i could hear cracked or knocks coming from floors or walls or even from other rooms in the building. \n\nas soon as i got close enough to the band they started playing. this song i recognized as their main song. this song i had memorized by heart as a kid. the animatronics started to move as they sang this song but their voices were warped and sounded muffled.\n\nafter being sort of mesmerized by the singing creatures i started to look around at the other rooms. in one of the rooms i found an arcade. i had completely forgot about it due to me not playing them as a kid.\n\ni was always short and i couldn’t reach some of the machines so i just gave up in total. while looking around in the arcade i saw tokens scattered on the floor along with some prizes which i thought was weird because as a kid why would someone leave the prizes in the building?\n\non some of the games they had signs that were taped on. most of them said out of order so i just left.\n\nafter i went out in was totally silent in the main room where the band was one playing just a second ago. the animatronics was completely quiet until the stage lit up once again.\n\nbut the friendly band i had once knew had not in fact started singing but instead started talking which is was they did in between songs.\n\ni walked up to the stage to watch where they were saying. peter the penguin finally said “boys and girl i hope you’re having a rocking saturday! but it’d be better if you get out!”\n\ni was taken a back by the words that just came out of the animatronics mouth which was different than the speakers that were on the stage.\n\njust then the animatronics turned their flopping bodies to me. for just a second it looked like the animatronics had real eyes. the eyes were bloodshot and wide open.\n\nthe animatronics one by one started yelling get out in a higher pitch voice kind of like  kid would. “GET OUT GET OUT GET OUT” they started screaming at me. \n\nmy stomach dropped hearing the word but i turned around to see a figure in the corner. it was long dark and i could feel the evil aura from across the room. i didn’t have time to thing before i saw the door swing open.\n\ni booked it for the door seeing the ghosts of children running behind me using their e every to fight off the dark aura in the diner. i ran until i got back to my friends house and locked the door to the guest room. i huffed and slid  down the door as i though about what just happened. i had realized i never did research on the place.\n\ni got out my laptop from off the desk and sat on the bed and looked up the reason why mitzies actually closed. after looking it up i found that randy sulkman, the owner of the diner had killed four children before the diner open and shoved their bodies in the animatronics. and with every new animatronic, he had killed another kid. \n\nin the end there ended up being 11 kids dead. peter, sally, gina, greg, ruby, toby, holly, billy, sonia, mario,and jean. after the cops had figured out what randy had did they were going to arrest him when they found him dead in his office, it looked it had been a murder but the death had still being undetermined.\n\nthinking back i had realized that those kids had saved me from whatever randy could have done to me. later looking in my bag i had seen 11 plushies, one of each character.",

        "text": "Ive recently turned 21 and ive wanted to travel the world since i was a young boy. Last year i bought a brand new van that i have recently turned into my dream travel lodge. i set out on this journey a few days i set out to go to a caravan park where you can either rent or purchase a caravan there either for a few days or you can bring your own van/caravan. So i went up in my van, the site was 4 hours away from where i live, when i got up there i signed in and headed up to where i will be staying for a week or so. i parked up with a bush behind me with nothing on the otherside of the bush and around 11 feet distance between the bush and my van. i set up my fire and get the marshmallows ready waiting for my mate from my home town to get here. 10 minutes pass and he gets here, we greet each other and sit down. As we toast the marshmallows we here little footsteps behind my van, but we think nothing of it. As i stand up i could of swore i saw a head poke out from infront of the bush, so i sprint to it but i see nothing. It was strange but there was nothing there so i had to go just ignore it. A few hours pass and me and my friend Eddy are going to sleep. I stay up for a little bit scrolling through instagram but then i gradually fall asleep. a few hours later at 1:17 i hear noises, almost like screaming but whilsting at the same time. I cant seem to make out what it is. i get out of bed get changed and behind the van just to see nothing, so i just go back to bed and sleep casually through the rest of the night. In the morning i ask Eddy if he heard it as well but he just says he must of slept through it. thinking nothing of it.  We get ready to go to the beach later but i realise the shoes i left by the door when i came back in last night have gone, we look all around for them but cant find any trace of them. So i just wore my flip flops as we were only going to the beach. When we got back 3 hours later we see my my vans doors slightly open even though i swear i shut it but again i just ignore it not thinking much of it but as i went over to my cabinet i see my shoes are just outside it. i pick it up and the inside of my shoes are slimy and damp, i think i must just be dreaming and start poking the inside of my palm and see if my finger goes through or not (thats how i tell if im asleep or awake) but it didnt and i felt a chill go down the back of my spine. I was creeped out so i go down to the arcade and spends money of machines i knows i wont get anything out of to try and get his mind off oft his morning, half and hour passes and me and Eddy go down to the bar, 3 hours later after downing pints and playing pool we go back to the van. we do what we did last night and toasted marshmellows just outside the van. This time i dont see anything from behind my van or hear anything so i feel safer. Then when we go to bed 4 and a bit hours later and as soon as i drift off to sleep i hear the exact same noises at exactly 1:17am i go out the van and look round the corner but this time theres little blood splatters on the floor. I never ran so fast back into my van. i shut the door and went to look for my phone to call the police. I started looking but then i look over at Eddys bed and see hes just not there, hes gone, then i turn back around and see my van doors slightly open again. i found my phone and called 999. They shown up, i told them whats been happening, so they looked around and found no trace of Eddy and the blood what so ever, the only thing i they found is my shoes under my van next to a hold in the field. I drove home straight and i refuse to ever go camping again.",

        "text": "My life was forever changed when I was just six years old. It was a beautiful summer day, and I was playing outside with my friends in our quiet suburban neighborhood. We were having a blast, kicking a ball back and forth on the sidewalk, laughing and enjoying the sunshine.\n\nSuddenly, the ball rolled out into the street. Without thinking, I chased after it, my eyes locked on the prize. I didn't notice the car speeding around the corner, and I didn't hear my friends' frantic shouts of warning. In an instant, the car collided with me, sending me flying through the air before I crumpled to the ground.\n\nThe accident left me with severe head trauma, damaging my auditory nerves beyond repair. From that day forward, I was permanently deaf. The world I had known was replaced with silence, and I had to adjust to a completely different way of experiencing life.\n\nDespite being deaf, I was fitted with hearing aids. While they couldn't restore my hearing entirely, they did provide me with some sense of sound. The hearing aids amplified residual hearing and vibrations, allowing me to pick up on certain frequencies and loud noises.\n\nMy parents were always supportive, and I grew up learning sign language, lip-reading, and using hearing aids to get by. I've never heard anything in my life, except for the constant, almost imperceptible buzz my hearing aids would produce. I was used to the silence, and it never bothered me.\n\nThat was until we moved into our new house.\n\nIt was a beautiful Victorian home, standing tall and regal among the other houses on the street. I loved the intricate woodwork, high ceilings, and the history it held within its walls. My parents thought it would be a great place for us to start anew.\n\nThe first few weeks in the house were uneventful. My family and I spent our days unpacking and settling in. Everything seemed to be going well, until one night, I began to notice something strange.\n\nI was lying in bed, staring at the ceiling, trying to drift off to sleep. My hearing aids were on the nightstand, and the room was enveloped in silence. Suddenly, I felt a chill run down my spine, and the hairs on the back of my neck stood up.\n\nAnd then, I heard it.\n\nA faint, raspy whisper, barely audible even to me. It sounded like an old woman, her voice weak and shaky. I couldn't understand the words, but I knew that it was coming from the walls. It seemed impossible.\n\nPanicked, I put my hearing aids back in, hoping that maybe it was some kind of glitch. The buzzing I was used to returned, but the voice persisted, clear as day. It seemed to grow louder, more insistent. I was terrified.\n\nI tried to tell my parents about the voice, but they dismissed it as my imagination. They couldn't hear it, and they insisted that it must be some kind of auditory hallucination, a product of my brain trying to make sense of the silence. But I knew what I was hearing was real.\n\nAs the days went on, the voice became more persistent. I could hear it in every room of the house, echoing through the walls. I started to make out the words, and what I heard made my blood run cold.\n\n*Help me... Please... Trapped...*\n\nThe voice was pleading, desperate, and full of despair. I felt an overwhelming sense of dread and sadness whenever I heard it. I couldn't sleep, couldn't eat, and couldn't focus on anything else. I knew I had to do something.\n\nOne night, when my parents were away at a dinner party, I decided to investigate. I followed the voice to the basement, where it seemed to be the loudest. There, I found an old, dusty bookshelf, filled with yellowed books and trinkets. The voice was coming from behind it.\n\nWith a surge of courage, I pushed the bookshelf aside, revealing a hidden door. The voice was louder now, desperate and pleading for help. I hesitated for a moment, then opened the door.\n\nInside, I found a small, dark room, covered in ancient wallpaper that was peeling off the walls. In the corner, I saw a skeletal figure, huddled and bound by chains. It looked like the remains of an old woman. Her empty eye sockets stared back at me, and I knew that this was the source of the voice.\n\nAs I stood there, the voice spoke to me once more. This time, it was filled with gratitude and relief.\n\n*Thank you... Free at last...*\n\nAnd then, just like that, the voice fell silent.\n\nI stood there, frozen in fear and shock, staring at the remains of the old woman. As the silence enveloped me, I felt a mix of relief and sadness. Her spirit had been trapped within these walls for who knows how long, and I had finally set her free.\n\nI called the police and reported the gruesome discovery. The investigation that followed revealed that the old woman had been the original owner of the house, and she had been locked away and left to die by her own family. Nobody knew the real reason, but rumors circulated that she had been accused of witchcraft and dark practices. The family had sealed her away in the hidden room to avoid a scandal.\n\nAfter the remains were removed, and the room was sealed off once again, I never heard the old woman's voice again. The house seemed to regain a sense of peace, and we continued to live there without any further supernatural disturbances.\n\nI still think about the old woman from time to time, and how she had been reaching out to me from beyond the grave. I don't know why I was able to hear her voice, but I'm grateful that I could help her find the peace she so desperately sought. In some strange way, her presence had changed my life, and I will never forget the haunting whispers that once echoed through our home's walls.",

        "text": "\"I know what this is about,\" the man across my desk sneered. \"You're trying to find out why I'm a psycho or a junkie or a career criminal. You're trying to find out why I can't just live in a little plaster box and pay my taxes like everybody else.\"\n\n\"I'm trying to find out who you *are,* Marcus.\" I sighed. \"And I would never call anyone any of those things. A person is more than just the problems they face–\"\n\n\"Problems?! You don't know *shit* about problems! I may not be like those sad fuckers out there–\" he gestured to the other homeless waiting in hallway of the center \"–but I've got a *big* fucking problem!\"\n\n\"That’s why I’m here, Marcus. Why don’t you talk to me about what’s troubling you?”\n\n\"Because I wanna sleep under the stars tonight, not get dragged off to some padded cell in a straightjacket.\"\n\nI leaned forward and pushed up my glasses, stroking my chin like I just couldn’t find the right thing to say. It was a disarming gesture that I found helped people to open up to me. As a social worker specializing in homelessness, I needed every helpful strategy that  I could get. Most of the people I worked with viewed me at best as a waste of their time, and at worst, as a threat. \n\n\"The more I understand, the more I’ll be able to help. That's all I want, Marcus. To help you. Will you let me do that?\"\n\nThe twenty-something blonde across the desk from me rolled his eyes, rubbed-red and dark-pitted from lack of sleep. Apart from that, however, Marcus wasn’t a typical case. He was well-dressed and clean-shaven, even if his suit had seen better days and his eyes bore the rubbed-red, dark-pitted signs of insomnia. \n\n\"Look, if I talk about this, there might be consequences. *Horrible* consequences. It might even bring *her* into your life…and I don’t wanna be responsible for that. I’ve got enough shit to deal with already...” Marcus grabbed the arms of his chair and pushed himself to his feet. If he walked out that door, I was sure I’d never get another chance to get him the help he needed. \n\n“Marcus, it says in your file that you never sleep in the same place twice. Why is that?” Marcus paused, his worn-out pack halfway up his back. Through its bulging seams, I could see his tent, sleeping bag, and clothing all packed neatly away inside. “It’s because of *her*, isn’t it?” Marcus sat back down.\n\n“You have to promise me that I won’t get locked up anywhere,” the young man muttered gruffly. “*And* that if I ever get picked up by the cops or whatever, you’ll do your best to spring me the very next night. I need you to promise me all that–*and mean it.* Look, I know it’s a tall order, and it’s okay to say *‘no.’* I’ll just walk out that door, you’ll fill out your little form, and we can both pretend that this conversation never happened…” As he looked across the desk at me with those soulful, sleepless blue eyes, I had the strangest feeling that *he* was the one taking pity on *me.*\n\n“Marcus,” I grabbed the young man’s hand solemnly. “I promise that I’ll do everything in my power to meet your conditions, should they ever arise.” \n\nMarcus looked around, as though to reassure himself that no one else was listening. The troubled expression on his face was one I recognized: he was struggling to convince himself to open his inner world to a stranger. I let him sit in silence for a while, knowing full well that at this point, what happened next was up to Marcus.\n\n“Sometimes it’s so right it feels wrong.” He said suddenly. “You ever been in a situation like that? You find the perfect job or the perfect girlfriend or the perfect opportunity, but there’s something *off* about it, know what I mean?” I nodded. “It was like that with the apartment,” Marcus went on. “My lease was running out, and I couldn’t find anywhere that wasn’t an hour away from work or a total scam. Then I found it: two bedrooms, one and a half baths. Newly renovated, but in a handsome old building…it was so close to my work I could walk there. And the price…it was less than half of what I was used to seeing. I flipped through the contract, looking for a catch…but there wasn’t one. The place was rented by a small property management group that only owned a few buildings. I *‘seemed like a reliable renter,’* they said, and I guess they liked that.” Marcus laughed bitterly. \n\n“I still remember how it felt, looking around at those bare wooden floors and perfectly white, empty rooms. I still hear my gut instincts whispering to me: *‘something is wrong here! Get out now!’* But what can I say? For eight hundred a month in the heart of downtown, I signed right away. I moved in a few days later after work. It was late, and I was too tired to mess with unpacking all those cardboard boxes. I fell asleep on the bare mattress without even bothering to take off my suit.” Marcus rubbed his sleeve thoughtfully, and I realized he was referring to the same suit he was wearing now.  I had horrible dreams that night, but try as I might, I couldn’t remember any of them the following morning.” Marcus shuddered.\n\n“Then I noticed the footprints…it looked like some barefoot person had crossed the dusty floor and stood just inches away from where I’d been sleeping. Funny thing was, those bare footprints started from the wall and didn’t turn back. Like whoever it was had walked out of solid brick, hovered over me all night, then disappeared. Was I creeped out? Sure, a little. But I also had to be at work in an hour, and I had no idea in which one of those damn boxes my coffee pot was hiding. The next night…”\n\nA door slammed in the hallway and Marcus jumped.\n\n“Look, do you mind if we walk and talk for this next part? I need a cigarette…and I’d really don’t wanna tell this part of the story indoors. *Just in case.*”\n\nIt was my policy to never meet outside the office; I’d heard horror stories of case workers who were robbed at gunpoint, stabbed with dirty needles, or simply got too attached or crossed the boundaries of professionalism in ways that ruined their careers. \n\nI don’t know why I made an exception for Marcus. \n\nPerhaps I, too, needed some fresh air. There was something claustrophobic about his story, the way his eyes kept darting around the room…\n\n“After work on the second day, I was beat. A picky client with a complicated problem had trapped me on the phone all day, and the stress burned the image of those creepy footprints right out of my mind. When I walked in the door I kicked off my shoes, chugged a glass of water, and fell onto the mattress face first. I only meant to take a little nap, then keep unpacking, but when I woke up, it was already dark and…and…*someone was chewing on my toes.*”\n\nI stopped walking. \n\n“I know what you’re thinking,” Marcus sneered. “It *does* sound crazy. My brain didn’t wanna accept it either. I didn’t wanna believe that a naked old woman with white hair hanging down past her waist was gnawing on my foot with a mouthful of twisted teeth. I yelled loud enough to wake up half a city block and kicked her right in the face…or at least…I *tried* to. My heel went through her like she wasn’t even there. No matter how I kicked and squirmed and fought, it didn’t matter…she just kept biting. When I ran away, she slithered after me on the floor like a boneless goddamn snake, always nibbling, licking blood out of the bite-marks on my legs. I threw pots and knives, said the Lord’s Prayer, even swatted at her with a broom. Nothing worked. In the end I ran outta the apartment, barefoot and bleeding, with two of my toes missing. Of course, my neighbors had called the cops, but when they went back inside with me…it was like she was never there.” \n\n“I was a mess,” Marcus went on. “I think I actually cried on the cop’s shoulder.  The hospital wanted to keep me for observation for a few days, and I said *“yes’* to everything. I mean, I sure as hell didn’t wanna go back to my place, and I was in no condition to work. Every time I looked at my feet, the reality of it hit me like a punch in the chest. *A ghostly old woman really had walked out of the wall of my apartment, and she really had chewed off my two right toes*. The cuts were as neat as though I’d been born without’em, and there wasn’t any blood in the apartment, either. It was like she’d lapped it all up.”\n\n“So no one else could see the old woman who attacked you?” I summarized.\n\n“It’s not like I don’t have proof! I can show you the missing toes if you want–” Marcus knelt to take off his shoe.\n\n“Hey, there’s no need for that…” I moved to stop him, and as I did, I felt a ragged gap in the flesh of the arm beneath his suit. During the few seconds that my fingers brushed against it, I couldn’t help but notice that the gap was the same size and shape as a human mouth. Marcus stood, looking up at the sinking sun with a sigh.\n\n“I thought I'd be safe in the hospital, who wouldn’t? There are armed guards and nurses everywhere and emergency call buttons...but even with all that, I still expected to see *her* come crawling around the corner, a hungry smile on her rotting face. I hardly slept at all that first night. Maybe that's why I dozed off so quickly on the second…\" Marcus took a deep, shuddering breath. \"All I remember is the pain. The pain…*and her face.* I’d left my arm hanging over the railing of the bed that second night and she just…chomped down on it. Her tongue jabbed at my veins, thirsty for more blood. Her eyes rolled back in her head…her tangled hair and decrepit shook from the joy of it…then the nurses came running in, and she was gone. The chunk missing from my arm was the only proof that *she* was ever there. The doctor's couldn't explain it, but after hearing my crazy story they didn't want to just let me go, either. In the end, I had to break outta the place.\"  \n\nI made a mental note to check the hospital database for any record of Marcus' story.\n\n\"You wanted to know why I live on the street, right?\" Marcus' shout brought be back to reality. \"*That's* why. Because every time I stay anyplace for longer than a night, *she* shows up again. I dunno who she is or why she chose *me* to torture, all I know is, if I ever spend two nights someplace, I'm done for. That's why I need you to help me. Make sure that no matter what, I never sleep in the same bed twice. Otherwise, she…\" Marcus sniffied; I was surprised to see tears pouring down his face \"... she won't even leave the *bones,* man. She'll drain me 'til there's nothing left.\"\n\nI can't remember what I said to that, or how I concluded my interview with Marcus. I just gave him my card and wished him the best while I tried to pretend my mind wasn't buzzing with the unsettling images of his bizarre story. When I finally calmed down, I realized I hadn't scheduled a second appointment with Marcus, or even established a way to contact him again. I'd have to rely on *him* to get in touch with *me*, which–considering his homelessness–wasn’t likely. \n\nThe guilt ate at me while I typed up our conversation and archived the file. Marcus never came back to the center after our talk, and I knew better than to go looking for him. I’m ashamed to admit that after a few years, I completely forgot about him…until I got the phone call.\n\nIt wasn't the harrowed young man in a business suit who’d reached out to me, however: it was a police officer from a few states away. He was getting in touch with me, he said, because of *\"somethin' sorta strange\"* that had happened in the county jail. Marcus Reginald Brownwell–Male, Caucasian, 31 years old–had been detained a few days earlier for vagrancy. Since then, he'd been *\"no end of trouble\"* screaming about needing to change cells. When Marcus didn’t get his way, he got violent. The warden had him transferred to solitary confinement…\n\n*For three days.* \n\nThe officer who'd called couldn't say exactly *what* had happened to Marcus during that time: *\"the damn cameras all went dead for some reason.\"* He could, however, tell me what was left of Marcus afterwards: an empty jumpsuit and a sickening, greasy stain on the floor. \n\n\"It's the strangest damn thing.\" I could hear the officer scratching his head on the other end of the line. \"We figure he's escaped somehow, and since he kept callin' you over an' over, and askin' for ya, and sayin' you'd get him outta there no matter what…well, we figured you might know sumthin. Doc-tor.\" The sneer in his voice told me all I needed to know about his view of my profession, but I hardly noticed. My thoughts were fixed on the last words he'd said:.\n\n*…Calling me over and over…*\n\n*…Asking for me…*\n\n*…Saying I'd get him out no matter what…* \n\nOf course! Marcus had my *old* number. When I switched jobs to work for an NGO, I'd updated my contact information with all the contacts I could find…*but I hadn't been able to find Marcus.*\n\nAnd if I was being honest with myself, I knew the real reason why: I had been too disturbed by Marcus' story to do my job properly. I didn't take down his information when I should have, and as a result…\n\nI had the first dream last night. The sheer horror of it, and the fact that I couldn't remember any part of it afterward, made me think of Marcus. Then, beside my bed, I saw the footprints. I'd been remodeling the kitchen, and with all the powdered plaster everywhere, it was easy to see that whoever had been standing beside my bed all night had walked out of the kitchen wall. \n\nA packed rucksack is leaning against my desk; I hope I've got everything I need. \n\nI've learned a lot about life on the streets over these past four years, but some things always surprise you.   \n\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/beardify)",

        "text": "My name is James, and I vividly recall the day my family and I moved into the idyllic village of Ashfield Pines a few weeks ago. We arrived in our time-worn, rattling car that had seen better days, with the faded paint chipping away and a stubborn musty smell. My sister Amy and I squeezed into the backseat, surrounded by an assortment of our prized belongings in hastily packed boxes, while our parents navigated the labyrinth of narrow, serpentine roads that snaked through the picturesque countryside.\n\nAs we turned a corner, the village unveiled itself, nestled between gently rolling hills and surrounded by a lush, verdant landscape. The sun cast a warm, golden glow on the charming, rustic houses, and the cobblestone streets seemed to invite us into the heart of the community. The scent of freshly baked bread and blooming flowers wafted through the open windows of our car, beckoning us to our new home. The only strange thing was that all buildings were grey and I did not understand at first, why.\n\n\"Dad, this place looks amazing!\" I exclaimed as we pulled up to our new home.\n\nMy father smiled. \"Yes, it's a lovely community, isn't it?\"\n\nThe village was a lovely place, with buildings constructed of natural materials and lush greenery everywhere. It seemed like the perfect community for a fresh start.\n\nAs we settled into our new home, I couldn't help but notice the faint plume of smoke in the distance. I wondered what it was, but my parents were too busy unpacking to entertain my curiosity.\n\n\"Mom, do you know what that smoke is?\" I asked.\n\nShe glanced up from her work. \"Oh, don't worry, James. Ashfield Pines is an environmentally friendly place. The smoke is probably from a nearby factory.\"\n\nDuring our first week, I saw new houses being built around the village, each one a testament to the community's dedication to sustainable living. The sight piqued my curiosity, but my parents insisted that I focus on adjusting to our new life.\n\nSchool started, and I quickly made a new friend named Peter. He was a kind, albeit slightly odd, boy who welcomed me with open arms. However, he warned me that our friendship might not last long.\n\n\"James, I have to tell you something,\" Peter said one day. \"Our friendship might not last very long.\"\n\nI laughed, not understanding what he meant, and brushed it off as a joke. I also asked him about the smoke in the distance, but he just shook his head and changed the subject.\n\nAs the weeks lazily drifted by, an unsettling pattern began to emerge in the village. I couldn't shake the nagging feeling that something was amiss. I started to notice the absence of familiar faces, like the kind-hearted baker who used to greet me with a warm smile or the elderly couple who tended the vibrant flower garden in the town square. At first, the disappearances were subtle, barely perceptible, but soon, entire families seemed to evaporate into the ether overnight, leaving behind empty houses with curtains were drawn and unlit windows.\n\nI shared my growing apprehension with my parents, but they were dismissive of my concerns. Their voices held an unconvincing note of reassurance as they insisted that the villagers must have moved away for various reasons, perhaps in pursuit of better opportunities or to be closer to family. But even as they spoke, I sensed a tension in their eyes, a flicker of doubt that betrayed their uncertainty. And though I desperately wanted to believe them, the eerie silence that enveloped the village, once filled with laughter and friendly conversations, whispered a different story.\n\nOne restless night, as I lay wide awake in bed, enveloped in the inky darkness of my room, the unsettling pattern of the disappearances began to take shape in my mind. My heart raced as I pieced together the chilling puzzle, understanding that the vanishing villagers were not random occurrences but instead a slow, methodical progression of houses being emptied of their inhabitants. Shadows danced on the walls, and the creaking of the old floorboards seemed to whisper a sinister secret that sent shivers down my spine.\n\nAs the cold moonlight streamed through the window, casting a ghostly glow across my room, the dreadful truth emerged from the darkness: our house would be next in line. The revelation sent an icy chill coursing through my veins, and my breath caught in my throat. I could almost hear the ticking of a clock, counting down the hours until our family would be swallowed by the mysterious fate that had befallen our neighbors. Desperation and fear clawed at my heart, leaving me paralyzed in the suffocating silence of the night.\n\nThis morning, I saw a truck parked near the construction site of a new house. My heart raced as I watched workers shovel ashes from the truck, mixing them with the building materials for the new house.\n\nIt bore the title \"Ashfield Pines Crematory.\"  \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nAshfield Pines. It was the town of death.\n\nI ran home, breathless. \"Mom, Dad! I think I know what's happening to the villagers!\"\n\n\"What are you talking about, James?\" my father asked, concern etched on his face.\n\n\"I saw a truck at the construction site. They're mixing ashes with the building materials! The people are disappearing because they're becoming part of the houses!\"\n\n\"James,\" my mother began, her voice trembling, \"we knew this day would come. We moved to Ashfield Pines because we believe in living in harmony with nature and making sacrifices for the greater good.\"\n\nMy father continued, \"This village has a unique way of achieving sustainability. The people here believe that by contributing themselves to the building materials, they are creating a stronger, more united community by becoming part of it.\"\n\nI stared at them, disbelief and shock coursing through me. \"You mean... you're okay with this? You want me to... to become part of a house?\"\n\nMy mother reached out and held my hand, her eyes filled with tears. \"It's not that we want this for you, James. It's just that we believe in the cause. We believe in creating a better world for future generations, even if it means making the ultimate sacrifice.\"\n\nMy father nodded solemnly. \"We're proud of you, James. And we want you to be proud of yourself, too. This is a noble path, and it will ensure that others can continue to live in harmony with nature.\"\n\nMy family is crazy, or they have been brainwashed, I am not sure but are clearly not themselves.\n\nMy voice cracked as I tried to reason with them, my desperation evident. \"Mom, Dad, this is insane! We're talking about our lives here, not some abstract concept of sustainability. There has to be a better way to live in harmony with nature without resorting to... to this!\"\n\nTears welled up in my eyes as I continued, \"Don't you see? This village is killing its people for nothing! We can't just accept this fate without questioning it, without fighting back. We can find other ways to be sustainable without sacrificing ourselves.\"\n\nMy mother's eyes shimmered with sadness as she shook her head. \"James, I know this is difficult to understand, but we truly believe in the greater good that Ashfield Pines represents. We've made our decision, and we can only hope that one day, you'll see the value in it too.\"\n\nMy father chimed in, his voice heavy with emotion. \"We're sorry you feel this way, James, but we can't change the path we've chosen. This is what we believe in, and we have to stay true to our convictions.\"\n\nThe room seemed to close in on me, suffocating me with the weight of their unwavering beliefs. I felt as if I was staring into the eyes of strangers, their familiar faces now cold and distant. My pleas for reason seemed to fall on deaf ears, and I was left feeling utterly helpless and alone.\n\nMy throat tightened, and I struggled to hold back the tears threatening to spill over. \"You're choosing to die for nothing,\" I whispered, my voice barely audible. \"I can't accept this. I won't.\"\n\nBut even as I spoke, I knew that my words fell on deaf ears. My family was resolute in their decision, and there was nothing I could say to change their minds. The crushing realization settled heavily on my chest, and I knew that I would never be able to see the world the same way again.\n\nDesperation and fear gnawed at my insides as I realized there was no way to escape this grim fate. The village is remote, surrounded by dense forests and uncharted paths that stretch for miles in every direction. Running away would mean leaving my family behind, and even then, I can not guarantee my own survival in the wilderness. My world, which had once seemed so full of promise, has now become a trap from which there is no escape.\n\nWith my heart pounding in my chest, I decided to make one last desperate attempt to find help. I grabbed my phone and dialed 999, praying that someone could save us from the horrifying reality that awaited us.\n\n\"Emergency services, how can I help you?\" the operator answered.\n\n\"I need help! I live in Ashfield Pines, and the people here are being turned into building materials for houses. My family is in danger, and I don't know what to do!\" I cried, my voice shaking with fear.\n\nThere was a moment of silence and I just realized how ridiculous I sounded, like someone on LSD.\n\nThen the operator replied, \"I'm sorry, but there is no village called Ashfield Pines on our records. Are you sure you have the correct location?\"\n\n\"What do you mean there's no Ashfield Pines?!\" I exclaimed, my voice rising in panic. \"We've been living here for weeks! Please, you have to help us!\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, but I can't help you with a location that doesn't exist,\" the operator responded, sounding apologetic but firm.\n\nDespair washed over me as the line went dead. I tried searching for Ashfield Pines on the internet, but nothing came up – no information, no pictures, nothing. It was as if the village had vanished into thin air. I can’t understand how my parents found this place, and why no one else seems to know about it.\n\nOverwhelmed by the hopelessness of the situation, I gave up trying to call for help. It is clear that no one outside Ashfield Pines knows of its existence, and I am on my own.\n\nThe minutes drag on, each moment heavier than the last, as I grapple with the terrible choice that lays before me. Is it possible to accept such a fate? To willingly offer me up as a sacrifice for a cause I barely understand? The very thought sends chills down my spine and leaves me reeling in a whirlwind of emotions.\n\nYet, as I looked into the tearful eyes of my parents and sister, I saw the conviction and love that guided their decision. They truly believe that their actions, however horrifying they seem, will create a better world for others. I love my family, and the thought of leaving them behind is almost as unbearable as the fate that awaits me.\n\nAs the shadows lengthen and darkness creeps into the corners of my room, I can't help but entertain thoughts of escape. I imagine slipping away under the cover of night, finding my way through the dense forests, and somehow starting a new life far from the sinister secret of Ashfield Pines. Can I survive on my own? Can I make a life for myself, free from the horrifying expectations of my family and village? And if I do manage to escape, what will happen to the ones I leave behind?\n\nAs the sun sinks below the horizon, casting the village in a final, crimson glow, I find myself at a crossroads. With each passing moment, the decision looms larger and more insurmountable, threatening to consume me entirely. I know I cannot escape the choice before me, but as the darkness closes in, I find myself unable to take a single step in either direction, trapped in a purgatory of my own making.\n\nWill I choose to stay and face my fate alongside my family, or will I risk everything for a chance at freedom? The answer remains elusive, shrouded in the ever-encroaching shadows, leaving me to grapple with the weight of my decision and the inescapable truth that, no matter what path I choose, there will be no turning back.\n\nWith a heavy heart, I made my choice.",

        "text": "It was a warm summer evening. My family was gathered in the living room, laughing and chatting. The air was filled with the comforting scent of my mother's homemade chocolate chip cookies. I sat on the plush carpet, playing with my toys, when the man appeared.\n\nHe was tall and gaunt, with wild, unkempt hair and a crooked smile that sent chills down my spine. His eyes seemed to pierce through me, and the room fell silent. Then, he clapped his hands twice.\n\nThe world around me froze. My family's laughter turned into an eerie stillness. My younger brother's giggles hung in the air like the remnants of a forgotten dream. I was the only one left moving, bewildered and frightened. The man locked eyes with me and grinned.\n\n\"Come with me, child,\" he whispered, his voice a mixture of menace and allure. I tried to scream, to call out for my family, but no sound came. My limbs felt heavy, as if I were submerged in a pool of thick syrup.\n\nThe man took my hand, and the world around us vanished. We were no longer in my home, but a place unlike anything I had ever seen.\n\nThe man led me through the dark, twisted hallways of his house. The walls were lined with grimy, cracked mirrors, reflecting distorted images of myself and the strange children that filled the rooms. The air was heavy with the stench of despair and the low murmurs of the lost.\n\nThe children were pale and gaunt, their eyes vacant and hollow. They huddled together, their individual bodies blurred and intertwined, as if they were melding into a single entity. I could feel my sense of self slipping away, like sand through my fingers. A dark urge to join them whispered in the back of my mind.\n\nBut I fought against it. I was determined to escape this nightmare and return to my family. I managed to slip away from the man's grasp, hiding in the shadows and crawling through the narrow passages of his twisted home. The echoes of his laughter and the sound of his clapping hands haunted my every move.\n\nI finally found a door that led me back to the outside world. I stepped out into the cold night air, breathing in the sweet scent of freedom. I ran through the dark streets, guided by the light of the full moon, until I reached my house.\n\nMy family welcomed me with open arms, tears streaming down their faces. They spoke of how they had searched for me, of how they had never given up hope. But the man's presence lingered in my mind. Every time I looked out the window, I saw his twisted smile and the cold, predatory gleam in his eyes.\n\nI began to question everything. Was this truly my family, or was I still trapped in the man's twisted world, a prisoner to his dark desires? Were these people mere figments of my imagination, created to lull me into a false sense of security?\n\nAnd so, I live in constant fear, never knowing if the life I have returned to is real or just another cruel illusion. The man watches from the shadows, waiting for the moment when I let my guard down.\n\nEvery clap of thunder, every applause at a school play, my heart races, and I wonder: Is this the moment when he will clap his hands twice and take me away once more?",

        "text": " I’ve received flyers in my mailbox for the new pizza place every week for the past month or so. First, introducing the grand opening. Then, advertising they were open until 3 AM. And finally, the standard fare of special deals and promo codes. Though the 5$ medium pepperoni was tempting, I was loyal to my local mom-and-pop shop. I’d been going there for years I would *never* have considered cheating on them had I not had a sudden hankering for pizza at 2 AM one night. The new place was the only thing still open in the suburbs. Given the circumstances, I figured I could be forgiven for my indiscretion, so I grabbed my keys and headed out.\n\nThe parking lot was empty, with the light of the pizza place acting as a beacon in the otherwise dark surroundings. Safe for a gas station a few streets down, every other building was empty, and when I say empty, I mean, with “coming soon” signs plastered on the windows announcing their future tenants and little to no furniture inside. I’m sure it was fine in the light of day, but in the early hours of the morning, there was something eerie about the new development. It didn’t feel lived in – probably because it wasn’t. They were connecting two suburbs that used to be separated by a forest and a highway. In the last year or so, they’d razed the forest to raise the buildings. Construction was nearing its end. In a few months, I had no doubt the place would be popping. For now, like I said, there was just the pizza place.\n\nI walked in and the industrial lighting stung my eyes, forcing me to squint while they adjusted. To its credit, the place was nice and clean, and it smelled *amazing*. I got a whiff of pizza and meat that had my mouth watering almost instantly. The place also had a semi-open concept: there was the order counter and behind it, a wall spanning only two thirds the length of the room, leaving door-wide gaps on either side. The wall had a large kitchen hole cut out of its center with two shelves lined with heating elements. You could see straight into the kitchen both through the hole or by taking a few steps to the side and peering through the gaps. There were the usual pieces of equipment, like fridges, fryers, and ovens. But then, there was the motherload: a ginormous conveyor belt oven. Think the little ones some hotels have where you put your bagel down and it slowly gets toasted before coming out the other end, only, like, SO much bigger. It had to be the width of at least two large pizzas side by side.\n\nI craned my neck to get a better look, and that’s when an employee scared the shit out of me. He just kind of…appeared in my field of vision. Quiet bugger. The guy was young. Maybe 18. Either right out of high school or about to graduate. He was pasty white with greasy hair and dressed in the store colors. He stared me down with laser focus and without uttering a single word of greeting. After a prolonged silence, I said hello. The fingers of his right hand impatiently tapped his leg. I checked my phone to see if I was one of those annoying last-minute customers, but he still had another 45 minutes to his shift, so it couldn’t be that. I figured I’d caught him in the middle of something.\n\n“Can I get a large pepperoni-bacon?” I asked, pausing for him to punch it into the register. He did not. Instead, he kept his death glare on me. He was emanating pure irritation. “And a side of curly fries. If it’s not too late. It’s fine if the fryers are off for the night, don’t worry about it.”\n\nStill, I got nothing out of him. Not an appreciative smile, not a nod of acknowledgement, zilch. Maybe it was my English? Even in the mostly bilingual city, some people could be a bit rude about that.\n\n“Uuh. Je suis un pepperoni bacon si vous plat? Et uh. Des frites uhm. Uh. Curly?\" I spun my finger around in circles to try to get the point across. He didn’t react. Maybe he was high? I pointed to the cash register. “You might want to, uh…”\n\nHe hit a few keys while never looking down, and then somehow simultaneously turned on his heels while also keeping his head angled towards me. I want to be clear, I’m not saying he dislocated his head to do this; he was kinda glancing over his shoulder. But the way he did it was so smooth and while unnatural to see, seemed completely normal to him. He kept me in his sights as he walked down the counter, around the gap, and into the back – all without requesting payment. Maybe it was due on pick-up? I lost sight of him somewhere around a corner.\n\n“O…kay.”\n\nI took a seat and looked out into the parking lot, feeling uncomfortably exposed. In contrast to the brightness of the pizza place, outdoors, I could barely make out distant houses and treetops. I was basically a billboard for anything or anyone out there. It felt like any moment, a monster would slam into the window like a hockey player. I imagined demonic eyes stalking me from a distance, waiting to pounce as I walked back to my car. That, or just as I reached safety, a clawed hand would grab me from beneath, slashing my ankle so I couldn’t escape. My imagination became too vivid when I saw a pale white face in the window slowly approaching, its features were melting off like cheese on a slice of pizza. Its hollow eyes drooping more and more with every step, like a latex mask melting off its wearer’s face. It looked so real, I got goosebumps. I blinked, and it was still there, creeping ever closer. That’s when I felt the electric sensation of someone behind me, and realized the reflection could just as easily have been of someone *inside*. I turned around, but there was no one there, and I heard a door closing somewhere in the back. I let out a sigh of relief.\n\nHad my pizza even been made? If so, I wasn’t sure I had the stomach for it anymore. I hadn’t heard anything from the kitchen since I’d gotten there. Pushing myself to my feet, I contemplated telling the kid I’d wait in the car, if only to get out of the bright light where I felt most vulnerable. Plus, I was kind of hoping it would nudge him into action, or that I would see him kneading my dough.\n\nI called out, “Excuse me?”\n\nThere was no reply, and from my angle, no kid.\n\nI took a few steps closer and scanned what I could see of the kitchen. It was empty, with some pizza pans littering the floor, which I hoped would be cleaned up at closing time. More importantly, I hoped I wouldn’t spy the kid grabbing one straight from the ground and putting my ‘za on it.\n\n“Hey kid, you back there?” I held up my phone and pointed to it. “I gotta bail. Got a text. My wife’s giving birth. I’m leaving cash on the counter for the trouble!”\n\nMy wife wasn’t pregnant. Scratch that. I don’t even *have* a wife. But it was the first excuse that came to mind. I remember thinking this was what I got for being disloyal to my mom-and-pop shop. I pulled out my wallet, but before coughing out the dough (pun intended), I wanted to check the oven. I can be a little flip-floppy at times, I admit it. I thought I was overthinking things, and maybe my pizza was already baking, and the kid had just run to the bathroom. I mean, he *had* looked impatient earlier. Maybe I’d caught him right as he was about to have the biggest assplosion. Pressing my hands on the counter, I boosted myself up to look into the conveyor oven. There *was* something in there, but it was way larger than a pizza pie, and it was slowly inching forward.\n\nI hate that I looked at him for so long without realizing what I was looking at. I hate the growing curiosity as the shape slowly emerged from the shadows, like a picture being printed one line at a time. I know I was transfixed on it for a few minutes as he inched along. I know the image burned itself into my retina even though I couldn’t consciously make it out. That all changed when he reached the end of the belt and became bathed in halogen. The pasty kid, his face equal parts blue and roasted, rolled out of the oven and onto the pizza serving platform. Most of his greasy hair had been singed off. His face was twisted in pain. His mouth agape as though he’d been screaming in terror. His fingers were wedged under a black tie around his neck, which had gotten stuck in the belt and held him in a chokehold. It couldn’t have been for *that* long, as I’d only just spoken to him, but he looked long dead. I don’t know how I’d even know the difference. I just did.\n\nI heard a crack as the belt turned over and headed towards the underside, pulling his neck along with it. I didn’t know if the crack was the machine or his bones. I just know the way his head was dangling didn’t seem right. This time, the machine failed, not strong enough to pulverize a skull and pull it into the narrow space beneath it.\n\nI didn’t realize I was running out of the store until light turned starkly to dark. It was an out-of-body experience. When I think about it now, it’s like I can see myself from a bird’s eye view running away, like I had no control over my movements or thoughts. I was consumed with terror. It wasn’t until I was sitting in my car with the ignition on that I snapped back to my senses and called the emergency line. Firefighters were the first on the scene, as they typically are in the suburbs. I felt one of them gently pulling me out of the car and wrapping me in a foil blanket. They probably thought I was in shock. They were probably right.\n\nThe police assured me it was an accident – it could’ve happened to anyone. One of them clapped a hand on my back and, in what was probably an attempt at making me feel better, explained he’d likely suffocated long before he started roasting. I’m not sure that really makes a difference.\n\nHere’s the problem: the whole time I was there, it was dead quiet. I didn’t have headphones on. I was fully alert. I never heard this kid scream. Or him knocking over the pizza pans in his death throes. I never heard any sort of commotion you’d hear from something like this. And I *know* I heard a door closing in the back. What’s more, I later found out it takes 15 minutes for a pizza to bake. In other words, 15 minutes to go through the oven. I was at the pizza place for 5, maybe 6 at most.\n\nI told my friends about what happened. One of them said I probably saw the kid’s ghost and maybe he was asking me for help. I don’t think that’s what it was. His impatient mannerisms, the silence, the almost predatory stare? I got the impression I was interrupting some*thing* waiting for its meal.\n\nYou don’t expect creepy things to happen in new developments, but I guess they’re just as susceptible. I’m going to stick to the mom-and-pop shop from now on.",

        "text": "I usually don't answer phone calls from family back home as it's almost always family asking for something and usually that something is money. But one night I got a call from my cousin at 2 am. I declined the call and silenced my phone.\n\nWhen I woke up I had twenty missed calls.\n\n\"This must be serious,\" I thought to myself.\n\nI sat on the edge of my bed and called him back. There was no answer.\n\nI checked my voice messages. None of the messages he left gave any insight, it was just him panicking. I called my mom to see if she knew what was going on she said she didn't know. Then when I got home he called again.\n\n\"Ali, you have to help me.\" Haaron shouted, \"you have to.\"\n\n\"What happened? What's wrong?\" I asked him.\n\n\"I'm on trial. I don't even know what I did. It's not fair. I can't even see them!\"\n\nNothing Haaron said made any sense but I just let him talk. I rolled my eyes when I heard he was in court again. He had a way of getting into trouble.\n\n\"Well how much is the bail? I get paid this week.\"\n\n\"Ali, listen to me man. It's not like that.\"\n\n\"No it's fine. I'll send it this week.\"\n\n\"I was on trial by Jinn. They kidnapped me and there was a whole jury. A-a-and they were so mad at me.\"\n\n\"Haaron, what the hell are you talking about?\" I was getting annoyed at this point. He is a prankster but this has gone too far.\n\nThat's when he started crying. In all my years of knowing him and visiting him back home, I have never heard or seen him cry.\n\n\"You don't understand.\" He cried.\n\n\"I'm sorry. Tell me what happened. I'll listen. I'm sorry.\"\n\nWe talked for almost two hours. I had to Google everything after we spoke. I heard of Jinn before but I never knew they were real.\n\nApparently, Haaron was dumping trash in one area by his house. Because humans can't physically see Jinn he didn't know that he threw some trash on one of their family members. They went home and complained and then the leaders or chief, I don't know what you'd call them...well they decided to hold a trial.\n\nHaaron woke up one night in great pain and incredibly dizzy to realize he was being dragged by his feet toward a cave. He tried everything to get free but nothing worked. Finally, when he arrived he saw some figures. Then he saw a jury of twelve. He said they weren't quite human and they weren't quite animals. That's when he wondered if they could be Jinn.\n\nOnly one could communicate with Haaron. After he panicked upon seeing them, one explained why he was brought there. He explained to Haaron that he had been throwing trash in an area where one of their children was sleeping. Haaron apologized, pleaded, and begged for mercy. He explained that he couldn't see Jinn and he didn't mean to hurt anyone. The jinn gathered together in a circle and excluded Haaron. That's when they decided his punishment.\n\n\"Ali... I wish the punishment had been a beating or something. I could handle that.\"\n\nI hesitated to ask, \"What...what did they decide on?\"\n\n\"I can now see Jinn. At all times, everywhere. They thought that'd resolve the issue and I'd never make the mistake of dumping anything on them again.\"\n\n\"Well did it?\"\n\n\"Of course but now I see them everywhere, all the time. It's scary. I can't handle it. I'm always scared. I don't leave the house anymore but sometimes they walk by my window. Sometimes they're in my room.\"\n\n\"I-I don't know what to say. I don't know how to help.\"\n\n\"Just believe me. Nobody else believes me....I.... have to call you back,\" Haaron's tone changed. He hung up and I didn't hear from him again. I've decided to take time off work and go back home to see if I can find him. I need to know if he's okay.",

        "text": "“Hold the elevator!” Paulie shouted down the hallway of our office. I pretended not to hear him as I swiped my punch card, and went out the door. It was Friday afternoon. Quitting time. No need to be around Paulie anymore than I already had during the week. He was a Grade A creeper, to be frank, and it was a relief to finally be away from him, at least until Monday morning. All the other girls in the office hated Paulie as much as I did. Not only did he have a problem with staring at us all the time, but he didn’t hide how he was ogling over us. It made me and the girls in the office feel dirty and objectified. On more than one occasion, he’d gotten into the elevator with one of the girls in the office, and they said he liked to get really close to them and try to sniff them. \n\nHe’s a gross, disgusting piece of shit, but on this day, I wish I’d waited for him, and we’d gone down the elevator together. To avoid what happened to me next, I’d have let Paulie take a sniff of my heels, panties, and boob sweat if it pleased him. \n\nI wish I never got into that elevator.\n\nI punched the call button for the elevator and waited for the doors to open. While I waited, I kept watching the door to see if Paulie would appear in time. He didn’t. The bell rang, and I heard the elevator doors open behind me. I stepped inside quickly and turned to the panel of buttons. I mashed the close door button until the doors closed. As soon as they did, I immediately realized something was wrong.\n\nA sickening smell filled the small space, and I brought my hand up to pinch my nose shut. Then I heard it. A retching noise came from the corner of the elevator. It startled me and I turned around to find a man in the corner of the elevator. I don’t know how I didn’t see him when I got on. Thinking about it now, I was so focused on avoiding Paulie, I likely didn’t pay enough attention to have noticed the man in the elevator. As I made eye contact with the man, I noticed his face was green with a tint of illness about him. His cheeks were puffed so large he looked like he was about to burst. \n\nAnd he did. The man vomited. \n\nI gagged as the regurgitated contents of his stomach splattered against the walls and floor. He took a deep breath, and then another stream of vomit exploded forth from his mouth. I didn’t see this second round of vomiting as I’d shoved myself into the opposite corner of the elevator box and pushed myself against the wall as much as I could to avoid getting caught in his splash zone.\n\n“Are you okay?” I asked, knowing the man clearly wasn’t, and pushed the emergency button on the panel. Nothing happened. The elevator didn’t stop. No one spoke over an intercom. Nothing. It was as if we were cut off from the whole of humanity. \n\nThe Vomiting Man offered no response to my question. Our eyes met for what felt like the first time, and it was here I started to better understand the situation I was in. The Vomiting Man’s eyes were wild and rabid. My concern for the man disappeared altogether, and I felt afraid for my life. Not only in fear of the man himself, but of the illness he carried within him. Was his illness contagious? Was I exposed to it already just by being around him? I didn’t know, but I’d come to find out soon. \n\nAs our eyes locked, the Vomiting Man doubled over again and turned his head toward the floor. He retched, and continued vomiting, his body wracked with spasms. Between the bouts of puking, he gasped for air like a drowning man breaking the surface and taking in as much air as he could before going back under again. He gulped for fresh air only to continue barfing.\n\nThe stench inside the elevator was unbearable. My own stomach churned with each passing second, threatening to join the Vomiting Man in tossing his cookies along with everything else he’d ever eaten in his life. Thick, undigested chunks of food coated the walls and floor near the Vomiting Man. A small trickle of vomit seeped toward my shoes like a tiny river. The elevator felt as if it was tilting in my direction. I know this is impossible, but it felt like this at the time. \n\n\n“*Help*...*me*...,” groaned the Vomiting Man, and reached out with a vomit-covered hand toward me. The lights flickered, and the elevator shuddered to a sudden stop. The flickering lights produced a strobe effect. His eyes were strained and bulging from the sheer force and violence of his regurgitation. All the blood vessels in his eyes and face had exploded. Vomit spilled from his nostrils. Foamy, red drool dribbled down his chin.\n\n\nHe let out a scream, which inside the tiny confines of the elevator sounded like the T-Rex from *Jurassic Park*. I also screamed but in fear of him. His mouth was wide open. Wider than a human could open their mouth without breaking their jaw. Then I heard a snapping noise come from him and saw his jaw go completely slack.\n\n\nI screamed, and this was the biggest mistake I’d ever made in my life. The Vomiting Man leaped toward me and wrapped his arms around my waist. He tossed me on my back to the upchuck-covered floor and got on top of me. I struggled to knock him off me, but he was far too strong, and it was already too late. His body was wracked with another wave of convulsions and spasms. I felt his twitching and trembling on top of me. The Vomiting Man retched and heaved, and a fresh river of ejecta spewed forth from his mouth into mine along with my nose and eyes.\n\nThere wasn’t much I could do to respond. If I screamed, the puke would go further down my throat. Honestly, I couldn’t *even* scream because I kept choking on the puke being forced down my throat. I was forced to swallow chunks of whatever food the Vomiting Man had eaten. I felt vomit coming from out of my nose, and I couldn’t tell if it was mine or his. The Vomiting Man had my arms pinned to the floor. I could kick with my legs a little bit, but with all the vomit on the floor, I couldn’t gain any traction. The more I attempted to fight, the weaker I became until I felt like I was drowning in the Vomiting Man’s never-ending supply of puke. \n\nDarkness slowly overcame me as the elevator continued its descent toward the lobby of the office building. Mercifully, I lost consciousness until the elevator came to a stop. \n\nWhen the elevator stopped, the jolt of it woke me up. The doors slid open, and I found myself alone on the ground floor. I crawled out of the elevator, into the lobby, and collapsed against the wall. I was shaking from how utterly cold and violated I felt. The inside of my mouth felt slimy and acidic. My stomach churned. I knew what was coming. I turned my head to the side and puked my guts out. When I finished, I wiped at my mouth and felt yet another crippling wave of nausea force my insides to expel outward once more. \n\nAgain, I lost consciousness.\n\nWhen I awoke again, I was still slumped against the wall. A small crowd had gathered around me but it was Paulie’s face in mine which brought me back to reality. He was saying something. I didn’t understand him. Everything sounded muffled and far away. I pushed him aside and forced myself to stand up. After taking stock of myself, I concluded that for the most part, I was okay.  From head to toe, I was covered in vomit, but otherwise, I felt healthy aside from the burning sensation in my esophagus, nose, and eyes.  \n“Holy shit, Samantha. What the fuck happened to you?” Paulie asked, probably for the second time.\n\nStupidly, I spilled my guts (no pun intended) and told him I’d been attacked on the elevator by a very sick man. Paulie rushed over to the lobby security guard and relayed the information to him. There was a huge stir in the building for the next hour or two. The police were called. People were detained and not allowed to leave until I’d seen everyone who was in the building. The Vomiting Man was not among them until they checked on the elevators. \n\nThey discovered the Vomiting Man still in the elevator. He was dead. He’d puked with such force and frequency that his esophagus split open. Boerhave’s Syndrome is what I found out this was called afterward.\n\nWhile the investigation was going on, Paulie had run to a clothing store and got me a pair of sweatpants and a sweatshirt. They were a bit too large, but I didn’t care. It was good to be in fresh, new clothes. I cleaned up as best I could in the bathroom before I left for home. Paulie offered to accompany me home, and normally, I would have declined, but after this day, I didn’t mind the company.",

        "text": "I grabbed a bottle of cold water from my fridge, slightly struggling to twist the cap off as I walk back to my bedroom. The silence from midnight was loud. I entered my room to the sight of my dog and setup. Normally, I wouldn’t keep my dog in my room, I’d let her run free through as she pleases at night. I’ve never had any problems with it, and neither have my parents. I have a mom and a dad, an 11 year old brother and a 6 year old mute autistic sister. I sat down at my desk as I took a drink from the water bottle and set it down lightly on the coaster.\n“Thanks everyone for tuning into the stream! Check in tomorrow for some more Fall Guys with me!” said my favorite streamer, HousePlant112, waving the camera off as he normally does every night. I went to sleep. I woke up in the middle of the night to a sound playing from my laptop. I slowly and carefully got up and walked towards my laptop, my heart pulsing in my ears. I opened my laptop, realizing I forgot to exit the Twitch tab after he ended it. My eyes adjusted to the screen. What the hell? Is he in my house? I jumped back as I watched my favorite streamer walk towards my sisters room. He was breathing heavily, but he didn’t show his face, which was even weirder, because he always shows his face. He slowly creaked open my sisters door, her blonde hair visibly peeking from the sheets. I watched HousePlant112 start drawing back the covers of my sisters bed, the camera panning over to the back of her upper foot. He shined his meat cleaver at the flash of the camera. He started petting my sisters foot with the cleaver. I sat there, my jaw on the floor. I could not move. HousePlant112 started slicing back and forth at my sisters tendons, she woke up and tried to scream. But she was mute. She couldn’t speak… HousePlant112 then started sawing at my sisters wrists, restraining her from getting up. Tears were streaming down her face, and I could do nothing but watch in pure horror as i watched my sister get cut alive, like a pig in a slaughterhouse. Her face was full of pain and agony, clearly yearning for death as he mercilessly painted her bedsheets with cold red blood. He started tapping her throat with the blade as he giggled and shushed her crying. He started cutting at her throat. Red liquid mixed with saliva was spewing from her neck as she gurgled, drowning in her own blood. He sat there, her severed and threaded on hands trying to close the wound in her throat. She could not grip her throat because the muscles in her hand wouldn’t work. He left her there, bleeding out. I started crying, but I still couldn’t move, I was stuck. Like I wasn’t even in control of my own body. HousePlant112 then moved to my brothers room, killing him disturbingly quicker, like he wanted to watch my sister nonverbally suffer. But he wanted to kill my brother fast? What the hell? I saw him move across the house, bloody cleaver in hand. He moved to my parents room and silently creeped up, slicing their wrists as they woke up, crying in agony. I watched, tears assaulting my face as i watched my entire family recieve agonizing deaths. My entire family, murdered in front of me. By my favorite streamer, Houseplant112. I snapped back to reality as I heard my mom’s final scream. As my door got kicked down by HousePlant112, I woke up. I immediately jumped up from the covers, running to my sisters room. The bedsheets were soiled with red, but there was no sign of Anna. I went to my brothers room, where a pool of blood lay, avoiding his bedsheets, but there was no sign of Braeden. I went to my parents room, and there they lay from under the bed, two ankles, sliced open. 5 arms sliced open. The limbs of my parents. And then I saw my fathers severed head, pierced on the bucks antler they found on their hike. He was foaming from the mouth, blue eyes, moldy skin. I heard loud footsteps, as I turn around, HousePlant112 is standing in front of me. With a disturbing smile on his face, he speaks words.\n“Tune in next time!” He raises the cleaver up, then splits my face open. In my finals moments, I watch my body get lay under the bed with the rest of my family.",

        "text": "I go by the name Bugsy online, and I'm just a 21 year old guy living in America. I'm born to a fairly mixed heritage, with the main sides of my family being of Celtic and Native American descent. Because of this, I often have more insight to these cultures than the average person, and this is important because of where I recently moved to.\n\nI've lived in Idaho my entire life, and I've explored much of the American west coast but never really gone east much, not much further than Yellowstone. The Native American culture all around this continent is extremely rich, however, in the particular region west of Yellowstone, the stories are more peculiar. When we went to visit Native American settlements around eastern Idaho, my mom would frequently tell me to be careful what I touch and what buildings I enter. She would often speak of legends of shadow people and the Natives of the region believing certain portions of land had a weak barrier between the world of the living and the dead. My mother was always a skeptic when it came to mythos, but whenever I asked her to elaborate on this subject, she would simply say \"It's better if you didn't know. You're too young to have that on your plate.\" I always found this weird, but as we only visited such places infrequently, it wasn't much of an issue to me at the time.\n\nFast forward to 2021 and my mother dies. I could go into immense detail about just how horrid that experience was and everything that came after, but that's ultimately irrelevant to the story. What is relevant is because she died, both my father and I had major financial issues related to her death and we were forced to move from the valley I lived in my whole life out east, towards central Idaho. When we first got to our new home it always felt off to me. Things would move with nothing around it to do so, doors would lock with no one being on the side of the door where the lock is, but quite frankly I still didn't care much. I had been through so much that year that having a creepy place with some spooky occurrences was preferable to where I had been previously. However, I soon noticed it wasn't just our place, this whole town had something off about it.\n\nNot only are the vast majority of folks here Pagan (which is surprising considering how Catholic Idaho is elsewhere), but every single person I met mentioned being careful of the shadow people. Don't talk to them, don't try to touch them, just let them be. I hadn't seen any shadow people around, and I'm fairly skeptical on spiritual occurences after experiences I've had and how much I understand of certain beliefs. However, no matter who I asked about when it came to such a thing, everyone that has lived here for longer than a year was in agreement about shadow people very much existing. While all of this is spooky, I just kept pushing it aside as some form of local superstition or a way to scare folks out of town, as smaller more rural places like these don't like newcomers much.\n\nSo I went around applying for jobs and finally nailed one in the medical field, my much preferred field and what I was most experienced in. The place I work is a very unique form of care center. You can compare it to a skilled nursing home for older folks, however the entire facility is essentially just two really big, classic American houses segmented into several rooms. The first house was built in '81 and the second was built in '87, and after the original owner who had used these as apartments sold it to the new owner, the new owner has turned the place into essentially an old folks' home and hospital. The decorations are amazing, the place is very much up to state code (a rarity in any medical facility), medications are properly maintained, all staff are vetted in, the entire place feels like home and is lax on employees, what could go wrong? Turns out, I should have thought more about this place before immediately accepting the job, as things couldn't be worse.\n\nI started off on night shifts, being trained by a wonderful woman we'll call Vee for the sake of this story. Vee has worked at this place for 3 years, knows it inside and out and is one of their most trusted employees. My first night training under Vee, everything seemed normal until around 2:00 am, when I heard footsteps coming down the hallways with no one there. I asked her if she heard the same thing, and then she looked at me confused.\n\n \"I thought you said you lived in Idaho your whole life!\" She said to me.\n\n\"I have, just on the Western side. What does that have to do with the footsteps though?\" I replied.\n\nShe just simply laughed and then patted me on the shoulder before saying \"Kid, you've got a lot to learn.\"\n\nAfter she trained me some more on the cleaning procedures and how to toilet specific residents, she eventually called for a ten minute break. As we both sat down opposite of each other, she began to explain to me about the history of this particular facility and supernatural phenomenon. She revealed that she herself was also Native American, born to a local tribe, and the land the facility is built on was always cursed. The Natives never knew why, but shadowy figures, including a man, woman, cat, and 'multi-eyed octopus thing' would always show up in this specific spot.\n\n\"Look, ma'am, if you're trying to sell me a ghost story I'm not buying it.\" I told her bluntly.\n\n\"Ghosts?\" She laughed again. \"Don't be stupid. Ghosts don't exist. These things though... they aren't ghosts. They're something more.\"\n\nHer alarm rang for our break time to be over and we both got up, but before I began walking away she stopped me and said this;\n\n\"Before I forget, you know the death procedures in these facilities, right?\" She asked me.\n\nI nodded my head, as I have gone through the procedure before, and unfortunately many more times than once.\n\n\"If someone ever dies here, leave the window slightly open. You don't want to make it mad.\" She said in a stern tone as she just casually walked away.\n\nAfter that shift, in the morning I talked to my dad about the craziness of the night. When I got to the whole thing with footsteps and keeping the window open, my dad immediately said it was ridiculous and it's probably just floorboards creaking in a certain way. I believed him at first, because, rightfully, it makes no sense. You're telling me after hundreds of years of recorded history and scientific documentation of American lands, cities, people and such that this town which isn't even horribly small happens to house some shadowy figures that make spooky noises in a hospital at night? It's never been on the news, its nowhere on the city's website, none of the shadow people showed up when we passed by this place going to Yellowstone, so how is this at all real?\n\nFeeling slightly relieved after my talk with my father, I went to sleep. I woke up around 5:00 pm the next day and talked to a few friends over the phone before heading out to work at 9:30 pm. I told several of my friends what had happened the night before and just thought it would be a funny story down the line. Vee and I trained some more, and around 3:00 am, similar to the previous night, she called for a break. During said break, one of my friends was up uncharacteristically late and messaging me a ton. When I opened my phone, one of my friends was messaging me frantically about the place I worked at being documented as haunted. This friend has a tendency to be a bit overdramatic and come to conclusions very fast, so I said I wouldn't believe them without some evidence.\n\nJust then, they shoot me several articles about a facility in the town I live in by the exact same name being a common visiting spot for paranormal investigators since the 1930s! Even before the houses that make the facility now were built, the land used to have a mental hospital on it, with some very shocking and horrific records. It was abandoned in 1953 and then demolished in 1960 after drug dealers were using it to smuggle ingredients through, and then someone acquired the land in 1980 and built the first house/apartment building in 1981. Both buildings were then refurbished in 1993 and renovated in 2003, and ever since they've been majorly the same.\n\nThis was a shock to me. The employer made it sound like this was just some random, small facility made after a landlord couldn't afford maintenance prices anymore, not that this place used to have a completely different facility here with an infamous history. It also didn't help that later that night, when I asked Vee about the history of the place, she said she barely knew as the owner is some grumpy old fart who barely even inspects the place he's owned for nearly 30 years. The last time she spoke to him, he was in a massive fit about things being out of order, and the staff moving some particular decoration he put in the lobby. Vee described the decoration as some creepy, antique doll from the 1800s, decrepit and looking as if it had bloodstains. Our head admin moved it after several visitors complained of its creepiness and refused to put it back, so the owner then put it in a box in the storage room, locked said box, and said if anyone were to move it, there would be hell to pay.\n\nSkipping to my third and final night of training, things were normal until about 2 am when I heard a meowing sound coming from the lobby. When I looked down the hallway, I saw a cat, and I wasn't surprised as some of the folks in this building have therapy cats and perhaps one just got out. However, when I got within 10 feet of it, I stopped dead in my tracks. It had no face whatsoever, and it was partially translucent, like a literal walking shadow. I said \"what the fuck\" out loud, and then the thing just jumped into one of the walls, disappearing.\n\n\"So, you've met the cat, eh?\" Vee said before I even had time to move from my initial position.\n\n\"What is it with this place? Is there some demonic bullshit here or are y'all playing pranks or-?\" I began to ask in a rapid pace.\n\n\"Bugsy, calm down. It's just the way things are.\" She said in a solemn tone. \"Look, follow me.\"\n\nI followed her a couple hallways down, and right in front of room 8's door was a shadowy man, just staring at the door.\n\n\"You see that? That means they're getting ready to pass. As soon as a resident is past the point of no return, the shadow man will be at their door.\" She said in a strangely casual tone.\n\n\"That's... this is impossible.\" I uttered in complete disbelief.\n\n\"Welcome to the medical field, son.\" She chimed. \"I give her a week. Don't be shocked if she dies on your shift.\"\n\nAfter that night, I had issues sleeping. I stayed well up into the afternoon, just trying to piece together the situation. It all made no sense, yet it was happening before my very eyes, and Vee saw it too. During a staff meeting the day after, I asked other employees about the same things I saw and Vee showed me, and everyone had their own stories to share. From the newest employees to the head administration, literally every single employee here knew about these happenings... and yet they don't do anything about it? They don't try getting rid of them? They don't try researching them? They don't get a fucking scientist out here to verify that shadow people are not only real, but that there's this whole underlying mythos and lore that this whole time has been true???\n\nThen, it got me thinking about mom. She always said I had to be careful in places like this town. That the Natives believed and saw things that were creepy, unnatural or dangerous. She refused to elaborate for so long, and now I think I see why she did, as learning of this consumed my mind. Almost my entire weekend was spent trying to figure out just what the hell was wrong. Am I insane? Is it mass hysteria? Should I go to a mental hospital? So many questions and so little time, and soon enough I was back on the job, this time all by myself.\n\nMy first night by myself went off without much issue. A few spooky noises, no big deal. The second night, I heard random laughter coming from somewhere in the building. As I searched, following the sound, it lead me to an old Christmas doll on a table, with the nametag \"Gabriel\". It looked like an angel, so I guess this weird little thing was meant to be representative of the biblical entity of the same name. As I went to touch it, my fingers burned. It felt as if I was touching a hot oven. My mom said mentioned having similar reactions to books of occult origin... clearly this thing was bad news. I grabbed an extra towel, wrapped it in said towel so I wouldn't have to touch it, and then put it far in the back of the storage room. If I had it my way, I would have burned the thing, but I didn't want to get fired. After I put it in the room, I saw the shadow man again. However, instead of looking at the door, he was just staring directly at me. At first I felt nothing, but soon it felt like I was losing oxygen, or being choked.\n\nI called upon the name of the God I've worshipped since childhood, and the shadow man went away. After taking a break, the rest of the night went off with no issues.\n\nThe third night was very calm. Nothing much happened except for the shadow cat appearing in a window and vanishing. However, the house over was having complete chaos. I was frequently called by the staff on the other side of the park in the middle of the facility, and I had to assist them with cares for the majority of the night. Other than that though, nothing major. Now, the fourth night was... well, something else.\n\nGetting used to a night schedule after living on a day schedule really wears you down. At this point, I was super stressed, disoriented, and had a massive lack of appetite, and it was affecting my mental and physical health after 2 weeks of this job. Of course, the fourth night, right before my next weekend had to be the worst night up to this point. Residents constantly getting up, screaming, banging on doors, hallucinating, shitting the bed, it was like I was working on a full moon. On top of this, the shadow people were everywhere. Several shadow men showed up throughout the night in random spots before suddenly disappearing, the shadow cat thing was constantly running through the halls... but then, amongst the chaos, I hear something. It sounds like some form of music, raising up and down in tone rapidly. However, the closer I listened, the more clear it became that this wasn't music, it was a fall alarm going off. \n\nI sprinted towards the location it came from, room number 8, and I had gotten there just in time. For those who don't know what a fall alarm is, its a cushion pressure plate attached to a weight detector, often put on wheelchairs or beds for those with horrific injury, difficulty balancing, or broken bones. I had managed to get to the room right before the resident actually got off of the bed completely and falling, and helped her back into bed. However, she started grabbing at me and screaming, which was uncharacteristic.\n\n\"THAT BASTARD'S COME TO TAKE ME! I'M NOT GOING TO THE PEARLY GATES UNTIL I'M DONE!\" She screamed as she violently tugged at my arm.\n\n\"Its okay [name I can't disclose (HIPAA)], you're okay, I've got you.\" But no matter how much I consoled her, she never calmed down. \n\nIt became such an issue that whenever I would calm her down enough to leave, I would constantly check the hallway after doing literally anything else, as she got up and screamed, over, and over, and over. I would have to constantly run back to her room when in the middle of something else just to make sure she didn't fall, and after talking to my administrators, we were able to get hospice to come by and keep her company as I did my job. I went home that night so exhausted that I passed out, in my bed, not changing any of my clothes. When I woke up hours later, I had learned that only 45 minutes after my shift ended, this resident died. Almost an exact week after the shadow man was at her door.\n\nDuring the weekend I tried to forget about work, and just leave it behind, but every time I slept, I had some horrid nightmare about my mother. Her corpse walking around, haunting me in everyday tasks. Saying things like 'I told you not to go' and 'you didn't listen to me'. It was... horrifying to say the least, and I refuse to go into any more detail as it's a kind of dark and disturbing that shouldn't exist. I cried every time I woke up, and I felt awful, every single day. Its so hard to sleep during the day, especially with recurring nightmares, and there were several times I either refused to sleep or just couldn't. My physical and mental health was wearing thin, and I had to accept the reality that I work for dogshit wages at a place with spiritual bullshit no one fully knows or understands and due to money I am forced to continue this path despite everything telling me to get out. Believe me, I wanted to leave this job as soon as possible, but I had just come back out of homelessness and the last thing I needed was weeks without a paycheck.\n\nI wanted to leave. I wanted to go back home. I wanted to see mom again. I wanted the entire year I had to endure full of nothing but pain, death, confusion and tragedy to just go away... but I've learned all too often that you don't get what you want in life without working for it. As much as it sucked and I hated it, I returned to work, day after day. The entire second week alone at work I can barely remember. I remember it sucked, spiritual stuff was happening, but at this point I was just so apathetic to it all that I didn't care for it. Soon enough, I forgot that the sun even existed, as I got stuck in the nocturnal lifestyle, and never saw or felt the sun upon my skin for weeks.\n\nOn the fourth day of my third week alone on the job, it was peaceful. It felt nice, nothing crazy happened, I even had enough of a break to write some of my book. I went home thinking I had my weekend, until my boss called me in the middle of my sleep, around 3 pm, saying I needed to cover the night shift as the person scheduled to work that night walked out. I was so angered that I couldn't fall back to sleep, and so after hours of being awake, I begrudgingly went back to work that night.\n\nThis was the absolute worst night I've ever worked, anywhere. I would have rather been cleaning up after and fighting drunk, angry moshpit folks at the end of a late night concert like I've done in security before. But I digress.\n\nAll of the residents were awake. Every. Single. One. Not a single resident was sleeping. 4 of them were constantly wandering, mumbling random words and moving things around, and all of the others were in an almost catatonic state on their beds, simply staring into space. I've worked at these facilities a lot before, and I have never seen such collective and uniform behaviors from all residents, let alone at the same time. It was as if a hivemind was controlling them, half of them didn't even act like themselves. Some of the ones in their rooms would even come out to the main rooms staring at the window, saying hi to random people that weren't there. As I checked the files on these residents, almost every name any of them mentioned was of someone they loved that died. It was as if I was playing a real life horror game. No matter what I did, all of them would be in this catatonic state, all wanting to act on some random accord.\n\nI was sick, I was tired, I was beyond frustrated, but above all of that I wanted these people cared for and back in bed. Eventually, I did it! Everyone was cared for and put in bed. However, that wasn't the end of the chaos. As I was enjoying the peace and quiet, writing down observations and tracking behaviors, I started hearing noises. I heard a door open and I immediately jutted up, looking around, but there was nothing. I then heard what sounded like someone barefoot running straight at me. I braced myself, but no one was there.\n\nI then heard what is one of the freakiest sounds and or voices I heard in my entire life.\n\n\"Who are you to play in my house?\" Echoed a voice, sounding simultaneously like an old woman and young girl at the same time.\n\nThe lights began to flicker intensely, and the entire place went dark for maybe 5 seconds. Then, the lights returned. However, something touched my back. I turned around and looked and... remember that multi-eyed octopus shadow figure Vee mentioned? Yeah, that is a heavily oversimplified description. It's very form was incomprehensible. Its 'skin' looked like a black cloud, ebbing and flowing like water in a storm, its 'eyes' were like faint, yellow stars off in the distance of space, and they were everywhere. Its tendrils moved and flowed like water spouts, regularly changing how translucent they were, and its shape changed at random with seemingly no rime or reason. It was massive, as if I was looking at a being the size of a mountain, simply phasing through the roof and walls of this facility.\n\nThe more I looked, the less I understood. Its color wasn't just black, it would change shades every millisecond, and it seemed to occasionally reflect purple and blue light from a light source I couldn't see. It was as if millions of parasites were digging around its stormy sea like skin, and as if its center was null, void, pure nothingness.\n\nI called upon the name of the God I've worshipped since childhood once again, and the more I chanted his name, the smaller this being got, until vanishing from view.\n\nEver since, I put in a two weeks notice, but after having literally no bites on my more than 50 applications to other places in this town, I negotiated for a schedule change and different position instead. While the terrors of the night are not as present in this place during the day (though they are still around, believe me), my greatest worry now is how long I'm going to be stuck in this job. Besides the spiritual hullabaloo, I get paid only 14 an hour, and am often only given enough hours to make 700 dollars a week after taxes. This job is wearing me down so much physically and mentally and I am trying my damndest to get out of this place, but its as if these shadowy figures are doing everything in their power to stop me from leaving.\n\nHowever, being as stubborn as I am, I refuse to give up, and I'm currently trying to run my own contracting business and study to go into computers, even while I'm working at this horrid place.\n\nI now see why my mother warned me of these places. Why she said it was best to not look into it. The more you try to rationalize it, the more poisoned your mind becomes. They're like a cognitohazard. If you think about them too much or research them you fell down so many holes that you almost entirely forgot where you started, and you feel as if reality itself doesn't exist.\n\nI've done my best to stay away from these things, and even when they appear again I just ignore it and force myself to not think about it. I've got enough on my plate already to try and solve some mystery of eldritch proportions.\n\nI have several other things that have happened to me in this place, but I believe this is a good place for me to stop for now. I've been writing about this for three hours, and I'm getting that feeling like something is watching me.\n\nMoral of the story, if a Native American warns you about something in an area they've lived in for centuries, you better listen, or you'll regret you ever doubting them.",

        "text": "[PART 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11qlquw/i_saw_my_girlfriend_die_in_eighth_grade_recently/)\n\nA boy named Filip Bergström in 6B became our first centurion. He recruited some of his classmates to his cohort and one of his childhood friends. None of them knew anything about hacking, so we had to lean more on psychological strategies than technological ones. We gave his cohort a number of files—which we called weapons—and then instructed them to basically catfish whoever we considered bad into accepting the file transfers. At this time, people weren’t particularly smart with their computers, and the number of targets they succeeded in “nuking” was impressive.\n\nThis early on, it was only Julia and me who decided on the targets. We decided that we would focus on groups that were easy to identify and trick into opening our files and landed on game cheaters, neo-Nazis, and online predators. We spent a lot of time in different chat rooms pretending to be either fascists or little girls, and as soon as someone exposed themselves to us, we sent their information to Filip and his men.\n\nMy dad was as always oblivious to what was happening on the screen when I sat hunched over the computer in my room. He couldn’t even imagine the world that had opened up in front of me. He was just happy that I seemed to be doing so much better since meeting Julia and joining what he thought was nothing more than an online club for amateur computer programmers. Little did he know that his son was now the commander of a legion of cyber-warriors. In fact, it was something I couldn’t really imagine myself. It all just seemed like a game. But as the days went by and the list of targets we took down grew, I started to realize that this was something more real than anything I had ever done before.\n\nA culture slowly developed over our online chats. It felt natural, and to a certain extent it was, but most of it was Julia’s invention. It began with the Latinization of our names. Some remained the same, such as Julia, but most didn’t. Filip, for example, became Filippus and I became Benius. Next came the jargon. Instead of “hi” we wrote “salve,” and Julia insisted that everyone saluted me and herself as Dominus or Imperator. The members were quick to adopt this online language, and just as Julia had predicted, our secret way of talking to each other, albeit only online, formed a sense of unity between us.\n\nDuring sixth grade, our online legion grew quickly. Additional centurions from other classes and even from other schools recruited more and more legionaries to their cohorts. It was fascinating to see more and more people on my ICQ list adding their ranks and titles to their names. Julia made a beautifully detailed ASCII eagle standing on a banner with the following text: “Legio nulla. Ad victoriam.” We added this as a boot-up message on all the computers at school and also to our digital arsenal so that it became the last thing our targets saw on their screens before they got nuked. So far, the teachers had no idea about what was happening, and the ones who heard about it dismissed it as nothing more than a game.\n\nAt the end of sixth grade, during the summer of 1997, Oliver made another attempt at returning to the old ways where he was on top and I was on the bottom. He didn’t know what was happening online since he viewed everything that could be perceived as nerdy as a threat to his popularity. All he saw were the dynamics at school, and although he had seen the ASCII eagle on the computer screens and had heard of Legion Zero, he couldn’t fully grasp what it meant. To this day, I couldn’t even fathom it myself.\n\nOliver still had his close friends, but their authority among the other pupils was diminishing by the day and I suppose he had had enough on this particular day. He bumped into me on purpose in the canteen on a day when Julia wasn’t there to see it. It was one of the many excuses he had used before to harass me. He tackled me pretty hard, and I fell to the ground. My glasses slid over the floor, making it difficult for me to see.\n\n“Watch where you’re going,” he said with his sadistic smile. “Fucking *idiot*.”\n\nA great weight pressed down on my chest and a sharp pain erupted in my side. I couldn’t breathe. Oliver was sitting on me, his hands at my throat. A few strands of hair escaped their tie and fell over his face. I tried to cry out, but no sound came. I was struggling to breathe and the pain in my side was getting worse. For a moment, albeit only in my mind, I was back in third grade when Oliver had been King of the Playground and I had been at his mercy.\n\nBut the moment didn’t last long. Oliver let go of my neck. I tried to squint my eyes to see what was happening. Chairs moved across the floor. People were standing up from their tables. The voices that used to join in on Oliver’s malice now spelled sentences such as “leave him alone” and, perhaps more remarkable, “Stay back, you fucking vandal!” There was a short commotion. Oliver was pushed to the ground and his friends were held back. Everything was still blurry around me, but I managed to stand up. A boy in fourth grade handed me my glasses. I put them on and saw that over fifteen people had gathered around us to protect me. Filip was one of them. He held his foot on Oliver’s chest. So far, our militaristic jargon had been limited to online conversations. This was the first time that changed. Breathing heavily from the short fight, Filip said, “Dominus, what should we do with him?”\n\nI stared at Filip, trying to comprehend the insanity of the situation.\n\n“Centurion!” It was Julia’s voice, coming from behind me. “Let go of him before the teachers get here.”\n\nFilip did as he was told, and Oliver rushed up to his feet.\n\n“Salve, Dominus,” Filip said when she arrived and put his fist on his chest. The others followed with the same salute.\n\nOliver and his friends, mad with fury, looked at Julia as if awaiting her judgment.\n\n“The question isn’t what we should do with them,” Julia said. “The question is what they should do for us.” She turned to Oliver. “You can’t fight this,” she said. “Join the legion, and you and your friends will matter more than you could ever imagine.”\n\nA week later, Oliver became Olivarius—the tenth centurion of the legion. He recruited his friends to his cohort. I expressed my concerns about this to Julia, but she said that it was necessary for the next step, which was to move some of our activities offline.\n\nAs usual, there was some downtime during summer break since most of the pupils went on vacation with their parents, but Julia and I worked as hard as ever. Our biggest issue was that we had too many members in relation to the number of targets we could find, leading to a lot of members lacking something to do. To solve this problem, we built an online report book where members could receive orders and publish mission reports. Julia named it Castrum. We also created a cohort whose sole job was to find new targets and publish them in the report book.\n\nDuring the summer, Julia also began talking about something she called “anti-docility training.” The idea was that each centurion had to do at least one offline mission together with their cohort to establish a sense of bravery and readiness. When I asked what we were readying them for, she simply said, “The challenges of the future, Dominus.”\n\nIn seventh grade, an addition to the official salute to higher-ranking officers was introduced. Members now had to extend their arm upward, facing toward their superior, with their palms slightly down in a relaxed manner. When the teachers caught a glimpse of this, they understandably conflated it with the similar fascist salute and began talking to pupils about the legion, trying to figure out what it was exactly and who had created it. Shortly after, Julia and I were forced to go to the principal’s office. The principal was there with one of the school’s history teachers.\n\n“We have zero tolerance for neo-Nazis at this school,” the principal said. “And now we’re seeing a lot of our students doing Hitler salutes to each other! That’s against the law nowadays. Did you know that? Just recently they introduced something called a *hate crime*.”\n\nThe principal mostly looked at me with her concerned eyes, unable to understand how a good and innocent girl such as Julia could be responsible for something like this.\n\n“I brought Josef here,” she said and nodded toward the history teacher, “so that he can explain the historical context.”\n\nJulia remained quiet, which made me nervous. Josef began explaining why Nazism was bad, and even brought up his own family history. That’s when Julia finally spoke:\n\n“Can’t you tell the difference between a Nazi salute and a *Roman* salute? We aren’t national socialists for crying out loud.” Julia looked genuinely embarrassed for them. “We’re taking back these symbols from the fascists. Legion Zero isn’t some twentieth-century ideology! It’s based on an idea much older than that, the only idea that can save mankind from destroying itself through decadence and mind-numbing docility! If you’ve truly studied history, you should understand. The end point of capitalism is nothing more than nihilistic hedonism, and you can’t build a long-lived civilization on that. You just can’t!”\n\nThey looked at Julia, dumbfounded. The principal didn’t know what to say and didn’t seem to believe what she had just heard. After a few moments, Josef asked:\n\n“What idea are you talking about, Julia?”\n\n“The idea of Rome!”\n\nNot much happened after this, except we tried to hide our activities from the teachers a bit more carefully. The teachers did contact her parents, though, and expressed their concerns with Julia’s way of thinking. During this time, the legion was at its peak, and the activity on Castrum increased every day. Julia worked hard on implementing new features to the site, such as the ability to create chat rooms and have a list of contacts so that we wouldn’t have to use ICQ anymore, but ever since the day her parents were informed her mood seemed a bit off. It was like a deep sadness had taken a hold of her without letting go. This is where my memories also become fuzzy, something my therapist tells me is a result of repression. The last clear memory I have from this time is the night Julia called me in tears. She begged me to come to her place. I had never been to her house before, and I thought it was a big deal that she finally invited me over even if it wasn’t under the best of circumstances.\n\nI took the bus to her neighborhood. The rain was pouring down heavily, and I remember feeling a sense of dread as I walked toward Diplomatstaden, one of the wealthiest areas in the city and home of many embassies and ambassadorial residencies. Just walking on these streets made me feel out of place and, somehow, for every step I took toward Julia’s home it felt as if I was getting further and further away from her. I eventually found her house, a large white villa with a well-manicured lawn, and rang the doorbell. I remember being so nervous that my heart was racing and I could feel the blood pulsing in my temples.\n\nI heard her father yelling from outside the door. He was speaking Italian. Her mother seemed to try and calm him down. Julia, who must have seen me through the peephole, opened the door and let me in. Her mascara formed black rivers down her cheeks. Her dad was yelling from the kitchen. The only light in the living room came from the TV. A game of soccer was on. I had to step carefully not to tip over any of the beer cans on the floor. Her mother, also in the kitchen, was crying now. The old beer left a stinky aroma in the air, a smell that always brings this particular memory to my mind. I hadn’t seen this kind of misery before. On our way to Julia’s room, I saw a few framed photographs on a dresser. Her family looked happy in them, at least on the ones with four people instead of just three. Her dad yelled something extra loud to which Julia yelled back:\n\n“Testa di cazzo!”\n\nHer room wasn’t as messy as the rest of the house. On the contrary, it was almost sterile. She sat down on her large bed while I inspected her IKEA bookshelf, too nervous to sit down next to her. She owned all the volumes of *The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire* and the entire *Foundation* series by Isaac Asimov. There were also a few VHS tapes such as *Starship Troopers*, *Babe,* and the Swedish romantic drama *Vinterviken*.\n\n“T-These are some good movies,” I said, feeling like an idiot.\n\n“Can you sit down, please?”\n\nI swallowed loudly, trying to hide the rapid beating of my heart, and did as I was told.\n\nShe said something I didn’t quite understand, something about having to make a big decision that she wasn’t ready to share with me yet, and that it would change everything. Not just our lives, but the entire world. I didn’t know what to say, and just stuttered something unhelpful about how good she had been to me and that she didn’t have to doubt herself. Shortly after that, I received my first and last kiss. To this day I can still feel, not just hear, the warm whisper that followed in my ear:\n\n“Our love will conquer the world.”\n\nAfter this, all I remember are fragments: the cohorts marching up and down the schoolyard; the school choir singing a hymn that I only hear in my dreams but never remember when I wake up; the ASCII eagle put on an actual flag; the blood on the ground after the inexplicable jump from the roof of the school; Julia, dead in my arms… And after all that came the funeral, the collapse of the legion a few months later, and the return of the bullying just as if nothing had happened at [all](https://www.reddit.com/r/tobiasmalm/comments/112r4le/i_just_released_my_novel_the_cave_to_another/).",

        "text": "In my bedroom at pre-dawn, I stare at the ceiling fan, inspired by silence in motion. “Be the fan,” I whisper, then kiss the birthmark on my husband’s back, the one resembling the Aquarius constellation starting from the nape of his neck. I peel away white linens. My knee’s crack like raw carrots as I stand. I whip around to find Derek undisturbed, and slink into the hallway, grabbing the long sweater over the footboard as I tip-toe out, reduced to a nervous criminal sneaking in the night.\n\nThe cleaner and coffee scented kitchen is a refuge of natural materials: marble countertops, blonde shaker cabinets, wood paneled appliances, stone floors, and a mini-kumquat tree planted in a jute basket.\n\nI pour water into the tree, taken from my mother’s house after she passed, and sip my coffee from my favorite oversized mug spelling, “Human Race.” I open the window and leer towards the dew, the chirping birds, the pink rising sun, breathing with my eyes closed, finding gratitude for the compromised life I lead. I remind myself of what I have, perform my daily acceptance of dead dreams, and flutter my eyes open as I exhale through thirty-year-old lungs, hoping it’s not too late for one or two dreams to still come true. A spark. A sip. \n\nI turn for more coffee and am startled by Derek sitting on the countertop in his underpants. “Holy shit,” I gasp. He smiles at me, a side smile, like he’s pleased to spike my cortisol.\n\n“Weird sunrise, huh?”\n\n“Is it? I’m so used to the city sky I can’t tell if this is just what it’s like upstate.”\n\n“It’s almost time,” Derek says excitedly, as he hops from the counter and nearly skips down the hallway to his office. \n\n“Aren’t you cold?” I call to him, but he closes the door without answering. \n\nLater in the morning, I emerge from my shower to a completely dark house and approach the kitchen in my robe to investigate. Derek drew the blinds, even the curtain next to the kumquat tree. I find him staring into a toaster. We don’t have a toaster. I am simultaneously interested and cautious.\n\n“Hey babe, the kumquat tree needs light. You have to keep that shade open.” \n\nDerek ignores me, staring close to the toaster’s bright red coils. I imagine clear blue eyes piercing into the electricity, laser focused until a spark bursts from the slots, causing him to jump back. He looks towards me, wide-eyed. “Pretty cool, right?”\n\n“Um, I, where did you get that toaster?”\n\n“I made it.”\n\nHe takes eggs from the refrigerator, and I notice a burner on full blast with no food cooking. My eyes dart to the toaster, to the drawn blinds, to my husband’s wild hair as he breaks his eggs, still in his underwear. \n\n“When was the last time you took your medication?”\n\n“I’m done with that.”\n\n“Babe, you’re really not supposed to just stop that medicine.” \n\n“You know? I think this thing will actually make toast.”\n\n“I’m calling the doctor.\"\n\n“I feel great. Better than ever.”\n\n“You’re going to kill my mother’s tree.”\n\nHe shrugs and tends to his eggs. I throw the curtains open, flooding light to my mother’s plant, filling the room with blinding white in the process. I squint and sit, seeing white snow from the yellow sun hitting my face. When my eyes clear, Derek stands with plated eggs, toast and a proud grin.\n\n“It totally works.” \n\nHe walks over to the blinds and closes them, making the house completely dark again. I can’t tell if I’m more stunned by the speed in which he cooked, or the sheer disregard for me wanting the light. \n\nI snap from despondence, hearing Derek say, *“Hag.”* But as I look at him sitting and eating, then admiring his toast, it seems impossible that he spoke. \n\n“What did you say?”\n\n“What? I didn’t say anything.”\n\n“I gotta get to work.”\n\n“Okay. Love you.”\n\n“Can I make you a doctor’s appointment?”\n\n“You can, but I’m not going.”\n\n“Will you at least put my mother’s tree outside if you’re going to be a vampire today? I don’t know what I’d do if that thing died.”\n\n“Yes. Yes, I will. As soon as I eat.” Derek holds up his toast, “You want some?”\n\nI drive from Pleasantville into White Plains, to my day job as a receptionist at an advertising agency. Next to me, the other receptionist is a heavily tattooed, queer woman a few years younger than me. Charlie. She also moved up from the city not too long ago. We got along right away, both open books after a gentle prying, both doing the job for the paycheck, and later that day, when my entire life changes, Charlie becomes my co-captain. We both wear headsets. \n\n “I’m bringing her home to my mom this weekend,” Charlie says.\n\n“Is this the one?”\n\n“You know me.”\n\n“Right, ho’s in different gender codes.”\n\n“I am only seeing her at the moment.”\n\n“Maybe you’re settling down. You can be like me doesn’t that sound great?”\n\n“It does actually.” \n\n“I miss my life. The city.”\n\n“How’s baby making going?” \n\n“I think Derek called me a hag this morning. So, that well.”\n\n“You THINK he called you a hag?”\n\n“It might have been the voice in my head.”\n\n“I have that. She tells me to eat weed and have ice cream for dinner.\"\n\n“He’s so extra. All the time. He stopped taking his medication.”\n\n“Uh, that’s no joke. I could die if I stop mine.”\n\n“Maybe I should let him tether away. I could probably still get my career back.”\n\n“Self preservation, sister. I feel that. I mean, who hasn’t had a starter marriage?” \n\nMy cell phone rings with Derek calling. I hold the phone up to show Charlie, and she nods, letting me know she’s covering the lines while I take a personal call. \n\n“Hi, I’m working.”\n\n“Lauren, you need to come home.”\n\n“What happened?”\n\n“The skin on my back is on fire.”\n\n“Babe, I can’t leave work because you have a rash.”\n\n“My moles are pulsating. They are really big. They’re as big as soccer balls.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“Oh my God, one just popped! My back is bubbling like boiled water!” \n\nAs his moles swell and burst, he screams in agony. I scream-whisper into the phone, “I’m calling the doctor right now.”\n\n“I don’t need a doctor!” Derek screams, and hangs up the phone.” \n\nI sit at my desk watching the hustle of a functioning office while my partner is melting down. My phones ring and I answer the lines, then transfer them to the appropriate extension. My world spins. Charlie tries to make eye contact with me, but I’m shell shocked, re-traumatized from the last time Derek tried to kill himself, from uprooting the life that made me happy, from being indentured to a psychotic. Charlie grabs my arm to get my attention. \n\n“Is he going to hurt himself? \n\n“I really don’t know.”\n\n“You need to go. I got your lines.”\n\n“Thank you.”\n\n“Call me if you need anything. Or if he tries to hurt you.”\n\n“He wouldn’t do that.”\n\nI race home, screech into the driveway, and run into the house to find Derek passed out on the floor of our bathroom. His back is full of blood. I try to pick him up, but he is like a corpse. I check his pulse. It’s faint, but there is so much blood. I scream his name, throw cold water on his face, and shake him furiously, to no response. The best I can do is put a blanket on him and call 911. \n\nOur bedroom is full of ripped clothing. Derek tore his closet apart. He must have put on tee-shirt after tee-shirt, and I imagine they burned his skin, clearly specifically his back. His sensory issues with clothing is extreme at times, but this time it seems like he wrestled his closet like an alligator. I retreat to the kitchen to get my breath, knowing the medics en route. \n\nPeering down the hallway, his usually locked office door is cracked. I push open the door to reveal a sort of inventor’s workshop. It is supposed to be an artist’s studio, but as I pick up guts from dissected machinery, I wonder, is this art? Or madness? All around the room, inventions crackle with life. A drafting table holds a sketch of another solar system. Complicated math equations hang on the walls. I find evidence Derek is creating a device to open a worm hole, or at least attempting to.\n\nI cry. I cry hard. A post-it note is stuck to his laptop that says, “Lauren, open the flash drive and play the video.” He left his password, and when I hit play, there is a video of him, blood dripping down his arms. I look for blood around the desk where he’d just filmed, and find no trace of him. I hit play.\n\n*“Lauren! Lauren, I hope this is working. I’ll keep talking. They are coming. The things that took me when I was a kid and made these markings on my back. There are hundred’s of us. Find their families. Start at the Field of Daisy’s headquarters in New Mexico. I’ve been in contact with them already when I was on Earth. It’s where we organized, so you have some explanation. I hope you get this message. I will be trying to contact you. Keep all my machines turned on.”* \n\nI run down the hall towards the bathroom, to where Derek has mutilated himself. I want to scream that he cannot collapse the energy of multiple suns from his home office. He is not a quantum physicist. We do not own a super computer. He cannot travel through space time. He must start his medication again. I want to beat on his bloody back for being this heavy a burden, for letting his brain fall apart at my peril. \n\nBut when I get to the bathroom, Derek is gone, along with any sign of a bloody man on the ground just five minutes ago. I grab the door frame, completely floored by the impossibility. \n\nRed lights fill the house, followed by a powerful pounding on the front door. I excuse myself, telling the paramedics that Derek is fine after all. When they ask to see him, I explain he left. They look at me dubious, and give me a warning, telling me it’s illegal to call when there is no emergency. I close the door and melt to the ground.",

Often I drive on it. \"Bad part\" of town. Obviously. Drove it during the day. Drove it during the night. It's a big road though. It isn't that obscure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday I drove on it again. Decided to take a random right turn in the boarded up houses section. The boarded up houses aren't that bad. I have taken random turns before as well. I am Impulsive. Plus I can end up finding something neat. It's a great bonus actually.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nObviously I didn't find something neat. I stumbled upon the scariest sight in my life. Some may end up laughing at this story. I don't care. I felt what I felt. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA thin one way road. That's what I saw. With the most beat up cars on both sides. On the fringes were boarded up homes. The homes didn't scare me that much. The cars did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of the cars had its windscreen broken with something big. Maybe a chair. Truth be told I am pretty sure many of the cars had their windscreens broken. The cars in general were dented and fucked up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat scared me was the potential. This road... there wasn't much room. These cars were dented. Probably nobody gave a damn... and fuck it, it looked like I was amongst drug addicts who would kill me for a fucking hit. I don't care if that's inappropriate, I had reason to believe that. Plus the cars were probably robbed and getting stripped as well. It was a hellscape. Basically most of the \"bad part\" isn't bad but this was the bad. I just know. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd I was an idiot as well. I thought if I accidentally hit a car, if I drove through, I would have to wait like a good samaritan. I was a dipshit. I was an even greater dipshit though. I forgot to realize that even if it says one way, I could have backed out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI headed on in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFucking idiot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was slow. Very slow in driving forwards. The street wasn't that long in general, but it was still too long. Y'all know the drill. It's the basic shit except you could get killed. I remember this particular red car. On the other side I think was a pickup truck. I so gently drove besides that red car. It was jutting out more than all the other fucks. Once I did, had to avoid the fucking pickup. This is America. Red car was on my right. Pickup truck on my left. I drive in the right seat. You can figure it out. When I passed that pickup truck, I just pressed the gas. \n\nWhen I was out, I wasn't glad. At the end of the street I took a left turn and tried to find my way out as quickly as possible. Paranoid man. Got on to a big road I knew and got somewhat relaxed. \n\nLesson learned. There are actual bad parts. Never going into that one again. Sight is engrained in my mind.",

        "text": "I never thought my insatiable curiosity would become the very thing that would lead me to the edge of sanity. Yet, here I am, a mere shell of the man I once was, haunted by the horrors I encountered on that ill-fated voyage to the frozen wastes of Antarctica.\n\nMy name is Dr. Arthur Howland, a marine biologist with a fervent passion for the uncharted depths of the world's oceans. In the autumn of 2023, I received an invitation to join a privately-funded expedition to study the mysterious lifeforms that dwelled beneath the ice of the Antarctic. My sponsors were cryptic and reserved, but the prospect of untold discoveries was too alluring to resist. I should have seen it coming.\n\nWe set sail from Ushuaia, Argentina, a motley crew of scientists and sailors bound together by our yearning for the unknown. Our vessel, the S.S. Morpheus, was an aging icebreaker with a gloomy aura that seemed to resonate with the chilling tales of lost explorers and forgotten civilizations. As we ventured south, we were accompanied by the deafening silence of the vast, empty sea.\n\nThe first sign of our impending doom came when we reached the icy shores of the continent. We disembarked and set up camp, quickly realizing that the biting cold was the least of our worries. The air was thick with a palpable sense of dread, as if the ice itself was warning us to turn back.\n\nUnperturbed, we pressed on, drilling into the frozen depths to retrieve samples of the alien ecosystem below. The creatures we discovered were unlike any lifeforms I had ever encountered. They were twisted amalgamations of tentacles, claws, and eyes, seemingly thrown together by some mad cosmic architect. These abominations bore a malignant aura that stirred an unease deep within me.\n\nAs the days stretched into weeks, our morale began to wane. The sun never rose above the horizon, leaving us in a perpetual twilight that gnawed at our sanity. We were plagued by vivid nightmares and hallucinations, the darkness whispering forbidden secrets into our ears. Our camp was suffused with an atmosphere of decay and despair, and death seemed to hover over us like a shroud.\n\nOne by one, my colleagues succumbed to the madness. Some wandered into the freezing wasteland, never to be seen again. Others simply ceased to be, their bodies twisted into grotesque shapes by the unnatural forces that dwelled beneath the ice.\n\nThe culmination of our horror came when we discovered the ancient structure that lay hidden beneath the ice. It was an impossible edifice of cyclopean scale, constructed from a dark, otherworldly material that defied all logic. The architecture was both repulsive and mesmerizing, and the air around it was heavy with an evil that crushed our spirits.\n\nAs we explored the eldritch labyrinth, we encountered unspeakable horrors that tore at the very fabric of our beings. We found the remnants of a civilization long dead, their twisted forms locked in eternal torment. We stumbled upon monstrous entities that bled shadows and feasted on our terror. And at the heart of it all, a yawning abyss, an infinite void that beckoned us to embrace oblivion.\n\nIt was there, at the edge of the abyss, that I lost the last shred of my humanity. I saw the truth of the universe, a cold, uncaring vastness filled with suffering and despair. I saw the futility of our existence, an insignificant speck in the face of the eternal darkness.\n\nSomehow, I managed to escape that accursed place and make my way back to the surface. The few remaining members of the expedition followed, each a broken fragment of their former selves. We abandoned our camp and fled northward, driven by a primal instinct to escape the horrors that lay beneath the ice.\n\nOur return voyage was a nightmare of its own. The S.S. Morpheus seemed to have absorbed the malevolence of that accursed land, its dark corridors teeming with unseen horrors that haunted us day and night. Our minds were ravaged by the memories of what we had witnessed, and we could not escape the gnawing void that consumed our souls.\n\nAgainst all odds, we reached the safety of civilization, forever changed by our journey into the heart of darkness. The remaining crew disbanded, each seeking solace in the comforting embrace of obscurity. We swore to never speak of our experiences, lest the taint of that forbidden knowledge spread further into our fragile world.\n\nAs for me, I am forever haunted by the nightmares that followed me from the abyss. The things I saw in that forsaken place have left me a broken man, unable to find solace in the mundane comforts of life. I know that I am forever tainted, and that one day, the darkness will come to claim me.\n\nI share my tale not as a warning, for there are others who will undoubtedly be lured by the promise of untold knowledge and the thrill of the unknown. I share my tale as a testament to the fragility of the human spirit, and the unfathomable horrors that lie in wait beneath the ice of the Antarctic. May those who heed my words find solace in the knowledge that there are some mysteries best left unexplored, and some doors that must never be opened.",

        "text": "The house gets weird when it's just me, and him. There's a family emergency, so my Mom is staying in the hospital, and my Grandmother is visiting her. We take turns taking care of him. He has dementia. My old man is not much company, other than the rare lucid moment where we can have a normal conversation. Otherwise he just babbles on and on about nothing in particular. He also wanders aimlessly throughout the house, humming tunelessly to himself.\n\nOf course we have a Dog; a 9 year old Lab mix. But he spends most days sleeping. It's often so quiet here that even the sound of a pin drop can sound like a gunshot. So when I hear moving around or someone talking, it's enough to make me stop what I'm doing and listen. \n\nPop tends not to move around a lot, since he's preoccupied solving puzzles on his laptop in his room upstairs. That and we live next to a busy street near a large college. So there can be a lot of outside noise. Depending on the time of day. However, five out of ten times, when I do hear him move, I can hear someone else move around in another part of the house. Or following along right behind him. Dragging feet, or the thudding of heavy boots? The light brushing of soft slippers? Sometimes it's the soft padding of a child's bare feet. \n\nLike I said, I've never been bothered much by it. I'd like to think of myself as a logical person. Everything has an explanation. I've always written it off as outside noises. \n\nBut I've never been alone with my old man late at night. \n\nIt's night time when I am writing this, and it's 12:15. Sortly before this I was playing Rust in the living room, and my Grandmother hasn't come home from the hospital yet. I've paused my game to listen. The sounds of bumping and dragging can be heard upstairs. But only when I'm busy playing my game. So it's hard to figure out if it's just the game, or something else? \n\nThe urgent need to check on Grandpa hits my conscience like a truck running over a pothole on a highway. What if he got up and fell? What if all that moving around was him trying to get up? All these horrible thoughts raced through my mind while I hurried upstairs. I swear the floorboards creaked and cracked loudly under each hurried step. The bedroom door to his bedroom was cracked open, and I could've sworn I shut it… \n\nHe should be asleep, but I can hear movement inside. I stop at the top two steps when I hear a woman's sigh. \n\nNana wasn't home yet.\n\nI open the door slowly, and the nearby bathroom light shines in. Illuminating the dark room with warm light. I glance from the dresser at the far end of the room, and see my reflection in the mirror that sat on it. Craning my head through the crack, I look right to the bed, and I see his dark shape laying there. I wait until I see his chest rise and fall. He was fast asleep. \n\nWhat if he fell and got up? \n\n\"Hey…\" I hissed, at a low whisper. \n\nNothing. Did I just hear the wooden floorboards creak at the far end of the room? I look, but there's nothing there. Chuckling at myself for being so stupid, I closed the door. But as I did, something happens that sets all the hairs on my neck stand on end. \n\n\"Please, help me…\" \n\nA little girl's voice called from the darkness in the far end of the room. \n\nDamn me. \n\nThere was no one there. So why is it I heard a little girl? \n\nI didn't open the door to check, instead I rushed downstairs and fixed myself a pot of coffee and grabbed a smoke. I'm in my garage now, drinking my third cup of coffee. It's nearly midnight, and I can't sleep.",

        "text": "You know the cliche phrase, \"My inner child is coming out\"? I'm sure you've heard it once or twice. When I say it however, I mean it literally. You see, I have a condition called DID, dissociative identity disorder, more commonly known as split personalities. At any time, I could change from talking like a mature adult, to my other self. My inner child. This makes doing my job very difficult. I'm a manager at a local pharmacy, and the customers don't truly understand what's going on when I start talking in a little girl voice when I am a 27-year-old man. The worst part about the instances when Kelly, my inner child, takes over, is that I don't even realize that it happened until after the fact. I'll just be going about my day and then there will be a gap in my memory. I assume later on that I must've switched personalities during that blank period.  \n\nMy friends don't like Kelly. They say that she creeps them out. I'm not sure why, but then again, I've never met her. I've asked Lindsey, my best friend, about the episodes where Kelly is in control, but she never seems to want to talk about it. My wife doesn't talk to me about it either. Everyone acts as if Kelly doesn't exist, but she does. And I think she's dangerous. \n\nYesterday during work, I must've had one of my blackouts, or whatever I'm supposed to call them. I had just finished stocking the children's Tylenol when my memory goes blank. The next thing I know, I'm holding a box cutter with the blade out, and staring intently at an old lady looking at cough medicine. When I come to, I am mortified. What the hell was going on? Why did I leave the aisle I was in, come to this aisle, open my box cutter and walk up behind some stranger? Luckily, the woman didn't notice me, and I was able to pocket the razor-sharp blade before she turned around and saw what was occurring. \n\nI talked to Jamie, my wife about the incident, and she insisted that I see my psychiatrist about it. I reluctantly agreed. I already knew what Dr. Thompson would do, up the dosage on my meds. I believe he thinks I'm making it all up, which I can't blame him. I've never had an episode at his office, and I'm not going to fake one just so he'll believe me. The next day I went into his office, took a seat and told him the story. He sat in his chair taking notes while I spoke. At least, that's what I think he was doing, as I couldn't actually see the clipboard. After the session was over, he wrote me a prescription for a higher dosage medication as I expected. \n\nThe medicine never really did anything. It didn't stop the blackouts. They still happened, and if I didn't know better, I'd say they happen more frequently since I started them a year and a half back. Before I started seeing Dr. Thompson, Kelly only ever took over once or twice a month, now, however she took control on a daily basis. I explained that to the doctor multiple times, but his solution was always just to up the dosage. I hated him. He didn't take anything I told him seriously. He treated me like some kind of junky who just wanted pills, and then would be on their way. I understand why though, and in all honesty, I'd probably act the same way if I were in his shoes. My condition sounds crazy. I still remember the day he told me I had DID. I couldn't believe it, and in all honesty, I thought I was possessed, I never really thought of it as a split personality. \n\nI swung through the pharmacy on my way home from his office. It was my day off from work, and I was looking forward to relaxing and playing video games. I got my prescription from the young pharmacy tech, that couldn't be more than 1 year out of college and started the short drive back to my house. I knew Jamie would already be at work when I came home, so I'd have the house to myself for the afternoon, and I was perfectly fine with that. Well, not entirely alone. Our Saint Brenard, Bruce would be there to keep me company. Jamie works as in real estate, and is usually alone, unless showing a house to potential buyers. She didn't mind; however, she liked the freedom. \n\nAs expected, the moment I got home he came rushing to the door to greet me. I rubbed behind his ears, and he panted in pleasure. \"I missed you too buddy!\" I told him as I walked into the kitchen to refill his food bowl which was completely empty. I had sworn I had filled it just a few hours ago. *Weird.* I thought to myself. I wasn't going to dwell on it too much however, it was my day to relax after all, and that was exactly what I planned to do.\n\nI remember booting up my pc and opening up Steam to search for a game to play. Then, I blacked out again. The next thing I remembered was standing in the bathroom, looking at myself in the mirror. There was something off about my appearance and it didn't take me long to realize what it was; I was covered in blood. It wasn't my own blood I soon realized, and I had no open wounds anywhere on my body. I did a thorough search to make sure of it. I began to panic as I thought back to the box cutter incident and thought of what could've happened if I would've come to just a couple seconds later. *Whose blood was this?!* I thought to myself, not knowing if I truly wanted to know the answer. I ran down the stairs to find the front door open, and Bruce nowhere to be found. *Oh no... Please tell me I didn't hurt him,* I thought. I couldn't handle the pain it would've caused me if I had done something to that poor innocent creature. \n\nI looked all around the house. Once I knew he wasn't there, I went back upstairs to change my clothes and search for him outside, knowing that walking around in a bloody white shirt would draw attention to myself. I looked like freaking Billy Loomis for God's sake. I changed, cleaned up and walked outside the house. I walked up and down the block for what felt like hours when my phone rang. \n\n\"Hello?\" I answered. \n\n\"Is this James Donsley?\" A voice I didn't recognize asked on the other line. \n\n\"Yes? Who is this?\"\n\n\"This is Detective Monroe with the homicide unit of the LAPD.\" He replied and my blood ran cold. *Oh no. What had she done...* I thought. \"I'm sorry sir, but your wife was attacked at a house she was cleaning up... She was dead when we got here. I can't say anything more, but I would like you to come down to the station please.\"\n\n\"Yes... Of course, officer. I'll be there right away.\" I said, tears forming in my eyes. I knew it was her... But how could I tell the police that? They'd never believe me. They'd think I'm crazy, just like Thompson does. I got to this station and was greeted by a clean shaved man in a white shirt and tie. He had a badge on his belt, and I assumed it had to be the man I spoke with. \n\n\"You must be James.\" He spoke. I nodded. \"I'm sorry for your loss, sir.\"\n\n\"What... What happened?\" I asked nearly breaking down into tears once more. \n\n\"For me to tell you anything further, you're going to need to follow me.\" He said in a sympathetic tone. I agreed, and he led me into an interview room where we both took seats opposite each other. \"The neighbors of the house she was selling called when they heard a woman screaming. When we arrived, she was lying on the floor covered in blood. She had been stabbed 47 times, and there was no sign of anyone around.\" I began to cry once more. I couldn't contain my emotions. \"We looked around and the only evidence we found was a note. It read, 'Kelly was here :)', now, Mr. Donsley, I'm going to have to ask you a few questions. Starting with if you know anyone named Kelly?\" He asked.\n\nI shook my head, \"No officer,\" I sniffled, \"Maybe it was one of her friends I didn't know about?\" I lied. Guilt was waying on me, and I wanted to tell him the truth, but I couldn't go to jail... It wasn't ME who did it. It was Kelly, and she wasn't afraid to make sure everyone knew it. He continued the interview, asking me questions ranging from \"Where was I during the time?\" to \"Do I know anyone that would want to hurt her?\" I told him I was at home, and that she didn't have any enemies, \"everyone who knew her, loved her,\" were my exact words. And they were true... For the most part. I mean, every person she knew did love her... but I guess Kelly didn't.\n\nThe interrogation finally ended, and he told me he'd be in touch. I cried the entire way home. When I got home, however, a little bit of happiness washed over me. Bruce was back! Sitting in the doorway! I got out of the car, and he ran over to me like always. As he got closer however, I noticed something hanging out of his mouth... It was a note, splattered in red with what was presumably blood. \"Give it here, boy,\" I said, and he kindly obliged. I grab the piece of paper and unfolded it. What I read chilled me to the bone. It read:\n\n\"*She was a fun beginning, but next time I think we should try something a little less traditional than a knife. A chainsaw maybe? Idk. I'll figure it out. Anyways, I'll see you soon. Love, Kelly.\"*\n\nI read it over and over again, and I'm terrified. I'm not sure what scares me more... The fact that the cops are going to figure it out.... Or the fact that she's going to kill again.....",

        "text": " \n\nThe cobble stone path was lit only by moonlight. It was silent. Not even the chirping of crickets filled the night air. The path wrapped around a house and the moonlight spilled into the living room windows. I took a peek inside. It was barren except for furniture and a fireplace. No one was inside. Where was everyone? \n\nA man carrying a hatchet and a burlap sack sitting in his head walked past me. Oh good, there was one. But he didn’t do anything. Just kept walking. What kind of haunted house walkthrough was this? Where was the music? The chainsaws? Teenage girls screaming?  \n\nI continued walking down the path as it wrapped around the house. No one was on the trail. I looked for a trip wire to trigger a jump scare or something-anything. But the silence and absence of people was scaring me more than what I paid for. Suddenly, I heard a bass drop and music began to play over the hill away from the haunted house. Laughter and cheers rang out. Finally, a party or at least something for this so-called event. I trudged down the hill to find some girls dancing with solo cups in hand. It was a small party. \n\n“Hey, are you guys here for the haunted house?” I yelled over the music. They stopped and looked up the hill and then at me. \n\n“It’s closed, technical difficulties,” The tallest girl replied, “The real party is here. Grab a drink!” She cheered and went back to dancing. Awkwardly I shuffled away to the drink table and took a glance over my options. Just booze. No soda, and I wasn’t a drinker. One of the girls walks up beside me. I barely glance at her out of the corner of my eye. \n\n“Some party huh?” I asked, but no response. She stood there unmoving. I turned and looked at her and jumped, dropping my empty red solo cup. It was one of the actors. \n\n“Hey what technical difficulties were wrong with the house?” I asked. \n\nShe glared at me, her black hair curtaining her white glazed contacts so I couldn’t see her pupils. Her mouth sat in a thin line.  \n\n“Nice costume. It looks so real.” Again, nothing. \n\nI waved a hand in front of her face, “Hello? Anyone in there?” \n\n“Who are you talking to?” A fellow party goer asked. The girl was gone after I looked away. \n\n“One of the haunted house actors, she was just here.” \n\n“Dude, you were talking to thin air. Are you feeling ok?” \n\n“I’m fine, just confused. I came here for the haunted house walk through. Someone said something went wrong. Got a clue as to what that might be?”  \n\n“The house on the hill? That’s been abandoned for years. There’s no event going on there. Are you talking about the one a few minutes away?” \n\n“What? No, I was sent this address and bought a ticket. Even saw an actor walk right past me. Didn’t scare me or nothing.” \n\n“Wait wait, did he have a burlap sack over his head?” \n\n“Um yeah.” \n\n“Dude, you saw a ghost or some shit, that’s what the killer of that family was wearing as he murdered them in cold blood. The blood still stains the wooden floors of the living room.” \n\nThat she knew wasn’t true, she saw the living room with her own eyes and not a speck of dust was on a single wooden plank. What the hell had she seen? Who sent her that address? \n\n“Look,” she huffed, “I’m just here for the haunted house walkthrough. This sounds stupid but I’m trying to get over my fear of them, and thought why not try during the scariest night of the year?” She waited for the guy to laugh, tell her she’s pathetic for her fear. But he simply nodded. \n\n“No, I totally get it. I’m actually heading to the haunted house now, why don’t we go together? Let me get you a ticket if the one you have is rejected.”  \n\n“Wow, um, thanks that would be great. I’m sorry, what was your name?” \n\n“Jesse.” Jesse smiled and held out a hand. \n\n“Sarah.” I shook his hand. His skin was soft and warm in her palm. She wouldn’t mind holding onto it a bit longer. \n\nThey walked through the neighborhood downtown to the open haunted house. A line stretched down a grass path. Eerie music played from speakers as animatronics did their dance and spoke in low voices how this would be the last night, they’d be alive.  \n\n“Damn, that’s a long line,” Sarah stood on her toes as if that would give her a better view of the end of the line.  \n\n“Good thing I have express passes.”  \n\n“What?” \n\nJesse pulled two purple tickets out of his pocket. In gold on the end of the stubs read the word express. \n\n“Was someone else supposed to be going with you?” She asked. \n\n“My ex girlfriend. We broke up a few weeks ago and it was after I bought the tickets. She loves these things; I figured I hold onto them because someone else could always go with me or I could regift them to another couple.” Jesse explained with sadness in his voice. \n\nSarah lay a hand on his arm, “I’m so sorry, that must really suck. But I’m glad you decided to go-with a complete stranger that is.” She laughed nervously. \n\n“You’re not a stranger, not anymore. We shook hands, and introduced ourselves. Last time I checked that’s how you end being strangers with each other…if that makes sense.” \n\n“No, yeah totally.” She laughed with him standing awkwardly beside him. \n\n“Shall we?” Jesse motioned to the express line. \n\nSarah didn’t notice beforehand, but she was shaking. More than she was earlier, and it wasn’t from the chilly fall weather. Her kneecaps were twitching with nervousness as her mouth grew dry. Her heart knocked at her chest. \n\n“Woah, hey, it’s ok. It’s not real. I promise you. You can hold onto me the whole time. You really don’t like haunted houses, do you?” Jesse asked concerned. \n\n“No, I get…overstimulated by the noise and the lights and smells. It just gets in my head, and I feel trapped. I start having a panic attack when I can’t get myself to realize it’s fake.” \n\nJess nodded, “Let’s make a safe word, the moment you say it, we leave, the actors are required to escort us out if we’re uncomfortable. How about, pumpkin? It’s Halloween and seasonal.”  \n\n“Sure, pumpkin.” She repeats the word testing it on her tongue. It eases her anxiety slightly, and she moves forward to stand in the express line. As they creep closer and closer to the house, her breathing becomes shallower and more restless. \n\nIt’s not real, it’s not real, its not real, she tells herself.  \n\nThe ticket master takes the tickets from Jesse and opens the gate allowing them into the house. Sarah immediately grabs onto his arm; her eyes are glued to the floor only looking for how to get through the house and not run into the walls. It was a few moments before the action started. \n\nFists began pounding on the walls, and strobe lights flared. A chainsaw rippled and Sarah held her breath. People began talking. \n\n“Come to stay the night sweetie?” A woman spoke in a shrill voice in her ear. Sarah recoiled into Jesse. \n\n“You’re doing great!” Jesse called over the noise. \n\nSarah just squeezed her eyes tighter. She wish she could do the same to her ears. Block out everything.  \n\nAfter what seemed like hours they had to press through a thin hallway before getting to the exit. It required them to go single file. But as they progressed, the walls grew tighter. Sarah was forced to look where she was going. The doorway out was so close, she could taste the fresh air on her tongue. Jesse stepped out and let go of her hand, and the door slammed shut in front of Sarah. She jumped startled, but figured Jesse triggered a trap door. So she waited for it to open, when it didn’t, she tested the knob. It was locked. She began pounding on the door. \n\n“Hello? Jesse? I think I’m stuck!” She pounded harder, the fact that she was alone crept into her mind and her anxiety crept back in. Her knees trembled and she began panting heavily. \n\n“Jesse! Jesse! This isn’t funny! Pumpkin! Pumpkin! Pumpkin!!” She screamed at the top of her lungs. The next group should be coming up behind her, she would just have to wait. And so she did, but no one came. She sank to the floor crying. She covered her ears to hide the hideous music and sound effects. A cold chill ran over her as a hand landed on her shoulder, Sarah jerked up and sat the female actor from the party.  \n\n“Oh, thank goodness. I’m stuck or lost or, I don’t know. Can you get me out of here?” \n\nThe girl nods and helps her stand, she takes her hand and leads her away from the door. Sarah sniffled and cried softly as the girl led her back through the house. She lifted a carpet on a wall and had Sarah walk through. She wanted for the girl as she took her hand again. Finally, she was outside again, Sarah turned to the girl.  \n\n“Thank y-“but the girl was gone. She thought she could still feel her cold hand in hers.  \n\n“Sarah!” A familiar voice called out. Jesse came running towards her, “What happened? Are you okay?” Jesse asked and an actor was with him. \n\n“Yes, I’m fine, another actor led me out of the house.” \n\n“Which actor miss? Describe her please.” The male zombie actor asked. \n\n“Um she looked like the girl from the ring. Black long hair covering her face and pale skin. White nightgown.” \n\nThe zombie actor just stood and stared. \n\n“What’s wrong?” Sarah asked. \n\n“We don’t have an actor that costumes as that I’m afraid.” ",

        "text": "I found it, I found the portal to hell, at least that's what I think it is. I was heading up to visit my family in northern Canada when I had to stop at a motel to rest after driving for 9 hours straight. After stopping I got out of my car and noticed a small hole forming in the parking lot, right next to where I parked my car. I didn’t figure it’d be a problem, it just looked like a pot-hole. I checked myself into the motel after talking to the clerk, and headed up to my room. After I got settled in I turned on the TV to have background noise as I read my book.\n\nAfter a while I put my book down and turned on the news. It said the same stuff that it always has but I was looking for the weather. It is usual for Canada, it's going to be cold and snowy. Tonight it was going to be really snowy so I went outside and headed to a nearby 24 hour general store to get a windshield scraper for my car since I left mine at my house another 9 hours away. I grabbed one and a few Canadian snacks that I don't have in America. After that I went back to the motel and went to bed. I woke up around 7 in the morning and went outside to prepare my car for another drive.\n\nWhen I got outside the hole that I didn’t bother to check had grown in size and now had swallowed almost half of my car. Outside was warm, like Florida warm. I questioned my own sanity before I saw the small crowd that had gathered around the hole. I asked any of them to help pull my car out, but to no avail. So I tried to do it myself and ended up just almost ripping my fender off.\n\nI was left with few options so I chose to call a towing company and see if they could pull my car out but they thought I was  prank-calling them. I asked if anyone in the crowd if they had a tow truck to pull my car out. One man piped up that he had a tow truck but there was no way he could safely pull my car out but he would try. He left for 5 minutes and came back with his truck.\n\nHe hooked it up and started pulling when the ground gave out and my car fell, thankfully the man in the truck was fine, the hook had been taken with the car though. So here I am, sitting in the motel next to hell. I feel a strong computation to look inside the hole, maybe even jump in. I’ve been watching the hole and I’ve seen many people go into the hole. Many have been stopped, but others had no one to stop them. Right now the police are involved and it's only a matter of time before the government gets involved with this weird hell hole.\n\nSpeak of the devil and he shall answer, I’ve been ushered out of the motel by a Canadian soldier and within time I’ll either be sent to my family or back to America. I need to tell them my end of the story, then they’ll send me to a holding cell in a nearby jail for the time being. I am allowed my phone in here only because they have me in here because I was staying in a motel and they have nowhere else to put me. I have a feeling the men in the suits are here for me, and I don’t like it.",

        "text": "I slowly released the [knob](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11nc12i/site_46_is_offline_part_one/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf), silently praying to every God imaginable that the thing didn't hear me as I backed away from the [door](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11pw96t/site_46_is_offline_part_two/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf). This, however, was when said Gods decided I was on my own this time around because the next thing I know, the fucker shoots a tendril straight through the door -- which did I mention was *raw steel?!* When I saw this, I both lost control of my bladder and gunned it in the other direction.\n\nWhat was worse was that there wasn't a back door out of the Chem Labs, either. That door, the steel door that was ripped away from the frame like it was a fuckin' LEGO piece, was the only one that led in or out of the room, save, I guess, for the tanks themselves leading to the maintenance tunnels again. Backed against the rear wall, the creature stomping straight for me, with each tendril mercilessly stabbing the floor, I eyed the tanks both reluctantly, yet desperately. I obviously didn't want to have to go back into the tunnels.\n\nFor one thing, I was already beginning to see more and more of what the guy was talking about with the claustrophobia element. More than this, though, going back into the tunnels meant running the all too likely risk of getting lost again, after finally managing to get lucky enough to stumble so close to where I needed to go. *I'm right here, and I can't even cross the finish line. Out-fucking-standing.*\n\nThe creature was right on top of me, only inches away from where I stood. It could've snatched me with one tentacle and it wouldn't have even had to reach its full extension to do so. So, knowing I was only seconds away from death (or worse), reflexes kicked in and I dove headfirst to the right of it right as it shot a tentacle that would've probably gorred me straight through the chest, had it connected. I managed to dodge its first strike and was surprisingly quick to recover to my feet and start running again. Unfortunately, this burst of luck also ran out almost immediately when another shot from a tentacle slashed my right ankle, sending me flying forward on my face from the momentum.\n\nMy vision exploded into clouds and stars and I knew right off the bat that my nose was busted all to shit, feeling the blood just flooding from it. My leg though was what hurt worst of all with how bad it was stinging. Imagine you were slashed with a shard of glass, right; then had a bunch of fire ants crawl into the gaping wound and just start biting the absolute shit out of you from inside your leg. That's what it felt like; a crawling, progressing pain.\n\nThis thing was relentless, too, wasting no time in wrapping another of its inky, slimy tendrils around my aching ankle and hurling me like the featherweight I apparently was to it back into the far wall. That time, I felt a couple bones crack like a glowstick on impact. The thing came stomping for me to finish me.\n\nYou know how when you're about to die, your adrenaline will kick in, even if there's no strength left in your body? You're right there, right on the Grim Reaper's doorstep and your hand's about to ring the doorbell, cause that's all you really *can* do at this point, only to then somehow find it in you to say \"No, to Hell with this, I'm not going out like this, not yet\"? An innate, primal part of you that keeps fighting, long after you have been battered beyond the point of weakness. \"Survival instinct\", to put it bluntly I guess. Whatever you call it, *that* kicked in maximum overdrive because the next thing I knew, I was dodging two simultaneous tendril strikes like I'd just taken the red pill before bolting once again for the exit.\n\nMy leg was on fire, but I couldn't have cared less. Actually, believe it or not, the pain barely registered to me at all above that of a little papercut. Nor did the thought that I might now be infected really cross my mind; not yet anyways. No, right then, none of that shit mattered worth a damn to me. All that mattered was getting the hell out of the Chem Labs and making it to the main office to turn the signal back on and get us out of this place.\n\nWell, in that vein, I managed to make the next room and slam the door right in the creature's face, even managing to see the dent left in the door from the impact it made -- which I'll proudly admit made me smile a bit to see. Immediately after, though, the adrenaline that'd kept me going right up to that point decided my time was up and I was back to limping, barely even holding my ass upright at all. Thankfully, though, it appeared, for the moment that I could see at least, that it was the only one and from there, I knew it'd only be one more right turn down the hallway in front of me and it was a straight shot to the main office.\n\nThe challenge then was managing to get there without A, passing out before I could even make the damn bend, and/or B, mutating, thanks to the scuffle two seconds ago. I looked at my leg. The cut was diagonal, running the length of my ankle and I could see that, despite it being a quick strike, it was a deep cut, severing several layers of flesh. It ached and burned like nothing I could've even imagined before and I could even see a bright reddish pink ring forming around its circumference. Oddly, and alarmingly, it wasn't bleeding in spite of all of this.\n\n*Fuck, that can ONLY mean the damn thing's inside me!* I began to imagine what was going to happen to me when and how the thing would awaken inside my body. Where would the tentacles come out from, huh? My back? My stomach, or maybe from out of my mouth like the one from earlier in the tunnels? I wondered if any part of me would still be conscious enough to even think while I was like that. What would I be feeling, if anything? I'll say right now that this thought has continuously given me fucking nightmares, particularly when applied to the others that *had* mutated and what *they* were possibly feeling.\n\n*Get a grip, Rod.* I sighed and refocused. I couldn't lose my shit now. I had to keep going if there was any chance of getting out of this situation alive. Not only that, but if *any* of us were going to get out of here alive, I had to keep going. *Just... Get... To... The... Bend...*\n\nMy legs felt weaker and weaker with each step I took. Any second now, I was bound to fall on my face again and it wasn't likely I'd be getting back up again. Leastways not with *MY* legs, if you take my meaning. I managed to make it to the bend, where my knees buckled and I was forced to stop again and hold onto the wall for a moment to reorient myself. *Come on, not now... Not now...*\n\nThe main office was dead ahead. Hell, I could even see the goddamn control panel. I just had to get there, find the signal switch, get it up and running, and then I could activate the \"Lockdown Line\". I was so fucking close, I couldn't fuck it up here. Holding my breath, I began stumbling my way across the hallway toward the office, holding myself up along the wall. Each step saw more and more of my breath get stripped from me.\n\nI want to say I was halfway down the hallway when my vision blurred out completely. Everything was just one giant fuzz cloud to me. I still kept going.\n\nThe air got heavier and heavier. I couldn't see and my lungs were filled with what I would've swore were bricks of lead. My arms and legs, both, were so weak. I still kept going.\n\nMy chest started to feel like something was stabbing it from the inside. Then it moved from my stomach to my back, trying to push out from there. I still kept going.\n\nI struggled to keep my mouth closed when I felt the pressure worm up from my stomach and through my throat. *No, goddamn it! I can't lose out now! Have to get to the control panel... Have... To... Get...*\n\nI stopped then when I felt the control panel. I was there. I'd made it.\n\n*But I can't see a damn thing!*\n\nI started feeling around the panel. The knobs, maybe buttons, all felt the exact same; round and with no real distinction. *Damn it, which one's the one for the signal?!*\n\nWeakness took ahold of me fully and my legs finally gave out. I collapsed to the floor, where any remaining strength I had was all but used up in simply trying to hold myself together while my insides turned every which way, trying to burst out of me. Whatever this thing, this \"Specimen X-12\", was, was twisting my digestive tract like it was a balloon animal while simultaneously hammering the hell out of my rib cage. It was agonizing. I wasn't going to be able to hold on much longer, whether I wanted to or not.\n\n*Can't let go...* I remember trying to reach back up to the control panel, trying to actually pick myself back up, only to have to retract in pain again from a spasm coming from directly in the center of my chest. *I can't do it. I'm not going to make it!*\n\nThe world was fading away from me. Feeling throughout my body was ebbing slowly away from me, piece by piece. My ears, which had already been reduced to little more than a slight ringing noise, now faded away too. \"Specimen X-12\" had me completely. In seconds -- Hell, *IF* even *that* \\-- I'd be another one if these freaks crawling the facility, forever lost to life.\n\nThen, with what hearing ability I had left, I heard it. A static buzz from the walkie rang from my pocket. I'll say right now that I was actually, deep down at least, shocked the damn thing was even operational after having to tread water like I did earlier. But what did that matter then, right? The damn thing worked and now, I *might* have *some* chance at calling for help again.\n\n*There's still a chance to make it out of this!*\n\nI wriggled the walkie out of my pocket; no easy thing to do when all of your joints and muscles are too focused on trying to keep an angry lifeform from bursting out of your body. Trying to hold onto it wasn't easy, either, but still, I managed to do it while holding the button down. \"D-D-Daaah...\" My words cut off, feeling the pressure rising in my throat again.\n\n*\"Holy smokes, Rod, you're alive! Thank God! Listen man, it's all gone to Hell. Those things got in the bunker. I got out, but everyone else's gone. They've been turned into one of 'em.\"*\n\nHe sounded winded as he spoke, and I could hear his footfalls pounding against the floor. *\"Please tell me you've managed to make to the office and get the signal back online.\"* I mashed the button again. My mouth opened and a knot instantly tightened inside my throat. It was the feeling you get when you bite off more from a sandwich than you can chew at one time, and so the biggest part of it get's stuck; \"indigestion\", I guess, only throwing it back up, in my case, wasn't an option. I *had* to keep it down and inside.\n\n\"D-Daaaniel...\" I groaned.\n\n*\"Rod, can you hear me? You still there, buddy?\"*\n\n\"Daaniel... I'm in oooffice...\"\n\n*\"Huh? You're where?\"*\n\n\"Oooffice...\" I hacked a wheezing cough after feeling the thing slug the shit out of my ribs again.\n\n*\"Rod, I can't hear a damn word you're saying, what's going on? Have you made it to the office yet?\"*\n\nMy finger was shaking, about to slip away completely from the talk button. Pressure rose in my throat, far bigger this time. *Shit, no, not now!*\n\n*\"Rod, damn it, speak to--\"* He trailed off, and I could hear the sounds of something clanking in the background. *Fuck, they've found him!*\n\nAs quick as I could, I mashed the talk button and screamed, \"I'M IN THE OFFICE, HURRY!\" Then the walkie dropped from my hands. From that moment forward, the only thing I could do with my body was to clutch my stomach and writhe in absolute agony. The \"Specimen X-12\" inside me was pissed off now, I could feel it from the way that the damn thing was slamming itself around both the front and back of me.\n\nI couldn't see, couldn't hear, and I just barely had the ability to feel the ground beneath me. This was it. I'd made it this far, but now I was done for. The only hope I had now was that I'd hold out long enough so that when/if Daniel showed up, he'd be able to get the signal back and initiate the \"Lockdown Line\". He was the only hope now.\n\nBecause of my impairments, I lost track of how long it was, but I could remember feeling rough hands shaking me. I knew it had to be Daniel. He'd made it, and though I couldn't hear him, I could imagine him shouting, *\"Rod! Rod, you okay, speak to me, man!\"* I wanted to shout back at him, beg him to forget about me and hit the damn button, but I couldn't. My body was locked up tight; miraculously still held together, in spite of how bad a small part of me kind of wanted the pain to just end by letting the fucker out. I didn't though. I couldn't.\n\nI guess whatever my face looked like to him must've screamed this message loud enough for me anyways because the next thing I knew, I could feel him release me, hopefully to turn his attention to the control panel.I couldn't see, couldn't hear, and I just barely had the ability to feel the ground beneath me.

Then everything went completely numb.\n\nThere was nothing; nothing I could see, feel, hear, *taste*\\-- nothing. I was gone. At least, that was what I kind of hoped for. Better than the alternative in this case.\n\nWith what happened next, I'm honestly not entirely sure. I don't know just how long I was gone. Being perfectly honest, I seriously thought I'd mutated already and that I was one of the creatures. I was still somewhat conscious, able to form thoughts inside my head and all, but that didn't necessarily mean I hadn't changed yet. Who was to say the others had actually died completely while infected?\n\nThen however it happened; I actually woke up. When I did, I was greeted by blinding fluorescents, accompanied by the steady rhythm of an E.K.G. monitor. I could hear indistinct muttering around me, but was unable to understand any of it or see who was speaking because neither my vision nor hearing had readjusted yet. It was hours before I could see, hear, or feel again.\n\nAs I'd figured, I was in a hospital room similar to the medical treatment rooms back on Site 46, with the exception being that this particular area was far bigger and far more sterile looking than those back on the site. I remember shooting up in my bed, wondering what the hell happened to Daniel, only to have Daniel himself put his hand to my chest, saying, \"Whoa, whoa there, \"Bandit\", we lost 'em.\"\n\nI sat there, staring at him, almost hyperventilating for a solid two minutes at least before starting to relax again. \"It's okay, pal, we made it, we're in the ICU ward at the hospital now.\"\n\n\"Wha-What happened?\" I asked, still a bit winded.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, chuckling dryly, \"Where to start...\" He went on to tell me again that, at some point while I was gone, the quarantine area became compromised. When I asked how they could've gotten in, he told me something that not only sent my heart right back into a frenzy, but also confirmed my fears from earlier; that those things knew how to wait inside of people until the right time came. Apparently, in his case, lets just say the maintenance guy knew a hell of a lot more than he let on about \"Them creatures we was talkin' about\".\n\n\"I tried calling for you several times over the radio.\" he concluded.\n\n\"So did I.\" I replied. \"It must've been the tunnels, they must've skewed the range of the signal.\"\n\n\"Maybe.\" He sighed and then added with another dry chuckle, \"But we made it, didn't we?\"\n\nI sighed and replied, \"Yeah... Yeah, I guess we did, didn't we?\"\n\n\"How'd you get out of there, anyway? I mean, how'd you make it back into the main level?\" I opened my mouth, and then paused. I truthfully knew neither how to explain, nor how to know he could be trusted. I know, I know, how could I *not* trust him, right? After all, I'd have been utterly fucked without him, plus he was the only one who'd been on top of the situation since it began. Even still, though, I knew what what I'd seen wasn't meant to be seen by anyone except the eggheads themselves that bred the damn things in the first place.\n\nObviously, I wasn't meaning to try and keep it all a secret forever, but at the same time, there and then were neither the right place or time for it. So instead, I told him I got lucky -- which wasn't even that much of a lie anyways. \"Well, you almost *weren't* \"Lucky.\" he remarked.\n\n\"Huh?\" I asked.\n\n\"I thought for sure I'd lost you, too, Rod. The way you was rolling on the ground there, I thought you were about to go crazy on me, too.\"\n\n\"Oh, yeah...\" I sighed. \"Yeah, no, I almost did...\" Then another thought struck me and I shot up again, feeling across my abdomen.\n\nHe smiled and said, \"Easy there, bud, you're gonna be fine, Docs managed to get it out of ya.\" To this, I simply breathed a sigh of relief. I was going to be okay. Daniel even patted me on the shoulder and joked, \"Ol' Iron Rod does it again. Neither crates nor critters can take him down!\" I laughed at this. Good old \"Steel Jockey Humor\" at it's finest.\n\nI remember spending the rest of that day in the hospital. I was discharged with a clean bill of health early the following morning. That same morning, I remember reading an email from the Monolith officials that more or less said that Site 46 was being shut down until further notice. In that email as well was a worker's comp form that dictated that I would be receiving $40,000 a month, about my average salary by the way, for at least the next 12 to 18 months or until it was determined that Site 46 would be opened again for me and/or who the hell ever else was left to come back to work.\n\n*Right, like anyone would be willing to come back after that.*\n\nGod knows I never wanted to go back. In that vein then, I suppose this is somewhat a blessing in disguise, isn't it? If only it didn't come at the cost of so many people; innocent lives, just being sideswiped, forgotten. Call the incident whatever the hell they want, *I* was there goddamn it! *I* saw what happened to people just because they wanted to create some \"magic cure\" or whatever. *I* saw what happened to good men and women just so a bunch of jackoffs in lab coats could play hero. Not only that, but I have the documents still to prove it.\n\nI'm ending this here. I've said my piece and I've told you all everything. Now I have to lay low for a while in case one of the officials see this. I will say that since then, in preparation for the time where I open their little Pandora's box to the world, I have changed both my name and address. I've lost contact with Daniel and anyone else I used to know as well. Now you know, and now maybe I can sleep a little easier, knowing that I won't ever have to hear those words again...\n\n***\"We are sorry, but Monolith Site 46 is currently offline, please try reconnecting to our network and try your call again...\"***",

        "text": "Bear with me because I’m still learning how to use the gnarly gizmos of the twenty-first century. It’s been a hectic month.\n\nOh, and I guess I’ve, y’know, been trying to overcome the trauma of *returning from the dead*. But that isn’t even the worst part. I’ve scarcely scratched the surface of the past month’s horrors.\n\nI’ve not even told you about the Hollow Man yet.\n\nA new friend — most of my old ones are retired or dead, which is totally fucked — told me about this subreddit. First of all, the internet blows my freaking mind, man. A few geeks and freaks talked about it back in my day, but I guess this shit’s cool now, huh? Beats me. I’ll suspend my cynicism because this might be a good place to talk about my experience.\n\nI’ve been reading about the occult practice of Veilbreaking:\n\n&gt;… *whereby a deceased individual’s soul returns from the world beyond the veil to its earthly body*.\n\nI think that’s what happened to me, but who the *fuck* would bring me back after nearly forty years? I do have an itsy inkling, but we’ll get to that.\n\nAll I know with any sort of certainty is that my return has totally harshed the universal balance. There are forces that seek to eternally torture me, so I need to return my soul to the realm beyond the veil before that happens.\n\nI think I’m getting a little ahead of myself here. You’re probably confused. Let’s talk about February 5th, 2023 — the day on which I returned to the land of the living, thirty-six years after dying.\n\nDude, I wasn’t even psyched to be back. The process of resurrection is a hell beyond explanation, and I thought *death* hurt. It’s worth pointing out that I was flattened by a hit-and-run driver named Billy Riley — a high-school rival of mine. That’s a horrible way to go. And I remember, as I lay in a pool of blood, the taste of my own… Well, never mind all of that.\n\nThe point is that my resurrection was worse. I felt — and still do feel — like a reanimated creep. Like a zombie, man. And I was always a stoned slacker, but I just don’t feel right. It’s the kind of existential dread I used to feel when I was high, but I’m stone-cold sober, and this shit isn’t transcendent or eye-opening. It’s terrifying.\n\nI’m acutely aware of the fact that I don’t belong here.\n\nWhen I woke in 2023, I was lying on a pavement near the spot where I died in 1987. The houses looked a little different, but my surroundings were identifiable — you don’t forget your own death, after all. I was wearing the same denim jeans and leather jacket, though they were a little dusty and tattered. Blood-stained too, I realised. But my body was absolutely fine. Not a scratch.\n\nAfter a few unsettling conversations with perplexed strangers, I realised I’d woken up in the distant future. My first thought was that it would’ve be great if some egghead had invented a Time Machine so I could go back to a decade I understand. Then I realised I don’t even want that — I need to send my soul back.\n\nIt’s not as simple as dying, according to the laws of Veilbreaking. If I die in the wrong way, my soul might be lost forever — I might not be able to get back to the afterlife. I need to find the Veilbreaker, and I suspect it might’ve been the Hollow Man — my petrifying pursuer.\n\nHe approached me in a scantly-lit back alley towards the end of my night shift. I worked at McDonald’s, thanks to John — the guy who told me about this subreddit. Let me tell you something. It was emotional to see a brand I recognised. You have no idea what it’s like to wake up in a foreign world. It’s terrifying.\n\nAs I tossed out bin bags, I was vaguely aware of a dark figure, sitting on his haunches. He watched me from the shadows of the alley’s dead-end corner. I ignored the seemingly-homeless man, but he finally stirred when I prepared to walk back inside.\n\nThe shadowy observer rose to his feet, revealing himself to be well over eight feet tall. When he unsteadily tiptoed into the light, I shrieked. He had a crooked posture, leaning in a lopsided manner, and I suddenly realised that I recognised him, in a demented sense. He had a contorted version of Billy Riley’s face.\n\nHis jaw hung abnormally slackly, and his eyes were black, colourless spheres. As he left his hovel, drowning my screams with the sound of his hissing mouth, I noticed something even more horrible. The Hollow Man had been curled atop a pile of flesh and bones in the corner of the alley.\n\nOne of his victims — a bloodied, gutted woman — was still alive.\n\n“Help me…” She croaked.\n\nWhat could I do but gawp in horror? I continued to back away from the haunting  spectacle unfolding before me, but Billy kept approaching.\n\n“Hello, Ron,” The man groaned in a demonic voice. “I’ve been looking for you.”\n\n“B… Billy?” I cried.\n\nHe smiled, blood dripping from his crusty lips. “Thirty years of suffering… But now you’re home, Ron. And when they see you, alive and well, my name will be cleared.”\n\nI fumbled with the fire exit’s door handle, but it was locked.\n\n“Fucking Nadia…” I whimpered.\n\n“Still… Can I resist my hunger?” Billy whispered, placing a hand on my shoulder.\n\nI screeched and turned to face the monstrosity, which towered over me. Its enormous mouth grew large enough to swallow my head, and I could see the inside of Billy’s empty body. A cavernous chasm, begging to be filled. The Hollow Man.\n\n“Perhaps I’ve already lost too much to be redeemed…” He hissed. “There’s no use in keeping you alive.”\n\nI dropped to my knees and rolled to the side before Billy could engulf me. He snarled, snatching at my McDonald’s jacket, but I slipped my arms out of it and fled into the night.\n\nSince that night, I’ve been living on John’s sofa, praying that the alley abomination doesn’t find me. I’m currently researching the world beyond the veil, desperate for a solution. I know Billy is the key to saving me, but I think he’s beyond reason.\n\nMy soul is doomed.\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle)",

        "text": "[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11qsh7g/i_challenged_myself_to_ride_the_tram_for_an/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, the second day of my little journey is over, the one I came to call the Long Ride, and boy, do I have to tell you a few things. Things took a turn for the worse, but more on that later.\n\nAfter sitting in a tram for over twenty-four hours, I realized just how beautiful my city truly is. It’s breathtaking, full of old architecture, nice little parks, and a riverside panorama few other cities can compare to.\n\nThat morning, I actually took my very first toilet break. I don’t know how I lasted that long, but let me tell you, the moment I went, it was heaven.\n\nThe early hours of the day went by as usual. Once again, the tram was overcrowded, and a few times I noticed people staring at me angrily for not getting off my seat or at least moving my giant backpack aside.\n\nWell, tough luck. This row is my home for this entire week. Before you ask, yes, I specifically chose where I sat. Second tram car, third row from the back.\n\nThe first interesting to happen that day was an encounter with an older man.\n\nHe must’ve entered the tram between nine and ten in the morning. I only remember because I’d just taken another short video for my friends, and when I looked back up from the phone, there he was, sitting only a few rows ahead of me. It seemed almost as if he’d just appeared out of nowhere.\n\nMust’ve snuck in at the last stop, I reasoned.\n\nStrangely enough, he just sat there as the tram continued on to the end of the line station, and remained seated as the tram turned around and went back the way it came from.\n\nI couldn’t help but smile a little, but was also a bit confused. Were there other people who did the same dumb thing I did? Just riding the tram back and forth for no reason?\n\nWell, who knows, maybe he’s just a bored old man with nothing to do. Maybe he just enjoys tram rides or the scenery, or, hell, he doesn’t mind getting on the tram early and taking a brief detour before reaching his destination.\n\nI tried not to be bothered by him, but whenever I looked up from my book, he was still there, going back and forth and back again with me.\n\nAs I munched on another sandwich and some crackers, I couldn’t help but stare at the back of his head. It was two in the afternoon, and by now, he must’ve been on the tram for at least four hours. What the hell was he doing?\n\nI’m not going to lie. He unnerved me a little.\n\nA few minutes later, he got up, and I breathed a sigh of relief, thinking he was about to get off.\n\nInstead, he came and took a seat near me and turned his bald head towards me. I noticed that something was wrong with him.\n\nHis eyes looked glassy, almost hazy. The weirdest part, however, was his outfit. It just... didn’t fit. Not on his body, I mean, but in the twenty-first century. It reminded me of something I’d once seen in an old family photo album, a style popular multiple decades ago, long even before the reunion.\n\n“Interesting to see someone here for as long as me,” he finally said.\n\nI just stared at him, surprised by the gentle, well-meaning tone of his voice.\n\n“Oh yeah, it’s... I guess a dare between friends? To see how long I can last.”\n\n“Young people these days,” he mused. “But I sure did my share of stupid things back in my days.”\n\n“How come you’re on so long yourself? Are you enjoying the ride, the scenery?”\n\nHe was quiet, and for a few moments, he just stared outside, watching the city pass by.\n\n“Well, you aren’t wrong, young man. I’ve been on here for quite some time, longer than I’d ever have guessed, but it’s interesting to see things change. New lines, new stations. Feels just like yesterday that I rode on line five to the main station...”\n\nWhat he just said made no sense. There was no line five. Sure, there’d been one, but it was discontinued over two decades ago.\n\n“Wasn’t line five discontinued?”\n\n“Ah, yes, you’re right. But once you’ve been here for as long as me, you sometimes forget these types of things.”\n\n“What do you...? How long have you been here?”\n\nFor some reason, I suddenly felt cold. Something didn’t add up. Not just his hazy eyes or his outfit, but the things he said.\n\n“Much too long, young man, but that’s just how it is for some of us. We can ride on and on, but we’ll never reach our destination.”\n\n“The hell’s that supposed to-?”\n\n“You should be careful, young man. This place, like any others has its dangers, especially for those who stay on for too long,” he said, getting up.\n\nI said nothing. I could only watch as he walked on and entered the tram car ahead of me.\n\nThen, for only a single second, what I saw changed. It was only for the blink of an eye, but it made me cringe in terror and I felt myself break into a cold sweat.\n\nWhat had been a nicely dressed older man before now turned into a mangled, twisted corpse. Its upper body was caved in, almost torn apart. Its arms were dangling at its side, broken entirely. The worst, however, were its legs. They were nothing but a mass of ground flesh and bone.\n\nThen it was over, and once again, I saw nothing but an old man. He turned to me once more, a well-knowing, sad look on his face before he gave me a little nod as if to say ‘be careful.’\n\nRight at that moment, my phone vibrated, notifying me about a new message. I jerked and almost dropped it before I turned back towards the old man, or rather, where he’d been.\n\nHe was gone.\n\nI scanned the train ahead of me, then behind me, but I saw nothing. He’d just... vanished.\n\nI couldn’t help but shiver. What the hell had just happened? I thought about the mangled, twisted version of him I’d seen, the things he’d talked about. Had I just been visited by a freaking... ghost?\n\nFor the rest of the day, I couldn’t stop thinking about him. In the afternoon, the tram filled up again, then emptied out before the process repeated itself in the evening.\n\nAs it turned late, I settled back in my seat, put on some low music, and prepared myself for another couple hours of rest, hopefully a few more than yesterday.\n\nAs I sat there, I watched the few other late night passengers on the tram with me. In my mind, I gave them names and made up stories about them.\n\nRight there, a few seats ahead of me, sat Jenny, a young woman in her mid-twenties who was on her way home after a late shift at the nursing home. Further ahead sat old Rupert, a bachelor in his early sixties who’d just enjoyed a performance at the state theater with a group of friends.\n\nIt was strange, but I almost felt a connection with these people, as if they were my people, the citizens of Tramonia, a nation comprising nothing but this one lone tram, going back and forth forever.\n\nA few minutes later, a group of guys got on, guys who were clearly drunk. They were a loud, rowdy bunch, walking up and down the tram car, howling obscenities, and dangling from handrails like the idiots they were.\n\nAlmost unconsciously I felt myself drawn to them, and couldn’t help but watch them. They were breaking the laws of Tramonia, I thought, and would need to be punished.\n\nAs I sat there, half-nodding off, staring at them, I tried to come up with ideas on how Tramonia would handle crime and how those who’d committed them would be punished.\n\nI didn’t realize that one of them had long noticed me staring at them. His expression wasn’t normal, not one of mild curiosity. No, he looked pissed, or at least up for trouble.\n\n“The fuck you staring at asshole!?” he called out to me.\n\nI jerked up in my seat, averting my eyes, but I could already hear them coming my way.\n\nShit, now I’d done it.\n\n“Yo, bro, what’s up?” one of them brought out as he sat down in front of me.\n\nI didn’t say a thing, and instead tried my best to ignore them.\n\n“Hey, we’re talking to you!” his friend spat at me.\n\n“Nothing, just on my way home,” I mumbled.\n\n“Oh yeah, is that so?” the one in front of me said in a sing-song voice.\n\nI gave him another ‘yeah,’ and tried my best to stare out the window. This promptly landed me a slap against the back of the head.\n\n“What the fuck are you-?”\n\nI couldn’t even finish the curse because one of them grabbed me by the throat, raising his fist.\n\n“You think you can fuck with us, asshole?”\n\nRight at that moment, the driver’s voice could be heard via the intercom, telling them to knock it off.\n\nThe guys stared at each other in surprise, but didn’t move, and neither did they release me.\n\nA second announcement by the driver followed soon after, this one more serious. He assured them he was ready to stop them tram here and now, and call the cops should they not back down immediately.\n\nFinally, I was released, and after throwing me another set of insults, the three of them walked away. A few stations later, they thankfully got off the tram for good, but nothing without sending me a few more angry glances.\n\nWhen we pulled into the end of the line station, a place where trams would occasionally power down during the late hours of the night, the driver approached me.\n\n“Hey there, not to bother you, but I’ve noticed you’ve been on the tram for quite a while. What exactly are you up to?”\n\n“Well, I’m trying to get home, but-“\n\n“You’ve been trying to get home for the past five hours?”\n\nShit, he got me.\n\n“All right, no. To be honest, it’s a bet,” I started, giving him an embarrassed little laugh.\n\nHe raised his eyebrows, waiting for me to continue.\n\n“I told my friends I’d be able to stay on the tram for an entire week without getting off.”\n\nFor a moment, he just stared at me, then furrowed his brow before he spoke again.\n\n“That’s the dumbest freaking thing I’ve ever heard,” he said, shaking his head.\n\n“Yeah, it really is,” I agreed.\n\n“Well, not like I can kick you off for something like this. You’ve got a ticket on you, right?”\n\n“Sure thing, got myself a weekly pass just for the Long Ride.”\n\nOnce more, he raised his eyebrows, and I was quick to tell him it was the name I came up with.\n\n“Well, it’s dumb, really freaking dumb, but as long as you don’t cause any trouble, that’s it. Just try to stay clear of guys like the ones before.”\n\n“Sure thing, boss.”\n\nWith that, the conversation was over and the driver went outside to have a smoke or two.\n\nAbout half an hour later, the tram started up again, and the ride continued.\n\nThat’s day number two, guys.

        "text": "A couple years ago, I had just gotten a Ring doorbell security camera installed. After my mom and a couple of my friends told me about it, I decided to get one myself. I mostly wanted it for the security because there were recent robberies and break-ins around my neighborhood. A man across the street had his house broken into and he only had a few things taken such as his wife's ring and some money in his wallet. Not much got taken from him since he had owned a gun and chased the robber down the street while his wife called the cops. But anyways, I bought it for the protection of myself since I wasn't like Bob and owned a gun.\n\nOne night after about a month of owning the Ring camera, I was scrolling through Reddit because I was bored and I didn't have anything exciting to do. I would have played on my PC or played on my Xbox, but it gets boring after a while and I didn't like playing the same games over and over. I was scrolling through r/nosleep until all of a sudden I got a notification...\n\n\"Motion Detected at Your Front Door!\"\n\nA Ring notification appeared so I clicked it to see what it was. Sometimes Ring cameras give a notification that there is motion at the door if a street is in view of the camera. Cars will drive by and it gives a notification. I checked and there was nothing on the camera, I thought a car must have drove by. \n\nI tell myself its nothing and I'm going to read a few more posts before I go to bed. About 5 minutes or so go by until another notification appears...\n\n\"Person Detected at Your Front Door!\"\n\nI once again click the notification, thinking that the software gave a false report and that a bird flew by or something made motion that made the camera think it was a person. It was not. My heart dropped to see a man staring directly at the camera. He looked like he was not just staring at the camera, but that he knew I was looking at the camera and he stared into my eyes. I can never forget his eyes. I looked out the window, trying to see if I could see the man at the camera, but I was met with a tall man who's head went over the top of the window. I jumped back and hid in my closet and called to police. A few minutes later, the officers arrived and looked and searched my house to try and find the suspects. They didn't find them. One officer, Officer Ortiz-Cisneros came up to me and said\n\n \"I'm sorry but we couldn't find both of those men that you told us about. We are going to ask you to stay at a friends or families house while we investagate. Is that alright with you?\"\n\n\"yes,\" I replied, \"Do whatever you need to do to find them.\"\n\nI am currently writing this at my friends house, I will give updates on the situation that happened two weeks ago.",

        "text": "[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11ouczh/i_got_lost_in_the_woods_when_i_was_nine_years_old/)\n\nA handful of incidents happened before I emerged from college, nothing new or meaningful though. Just more reminders of how trapped I was.\n\nBy the time I was out, I knew what I had to do. \n\nI returned home, ostensibly taking a break to reconnect with family before going back out into the world. \n\nIn reality, I was planning to end this tireless struggle between myself and a single moment in my childhood. \n\nFirst of all, I tried to talk to my mother about it. One day over breakfast I brought the topic up. It wasn’t hard. When you’re back home with family for the first time in a long while, reminiscing about old events is as natural as eating.\n\n“Do you remember that time I got lost in the woods out back?” I started. \n\n“Oh yes. When you were six.” She nodded.\n\n“No?” I chuckled. “We lived in a third-story apartment in the city when I was six. I was definitely nine.”\n\n“You would have been six in…” she trailed off as she ran the numbers in her head. “We would have been in that housing block then, not that awful apartment.” She declared with certainty.\n\n“Okay, you’re right.” I admitted. It was true, but it was also entirely beside the point. “But the woods, you always warned me away from going in there. I’m just curious. I’m sure you remember how freaked out I was that day. Had you heard anything about them? Like stories, or crimes in the news or something?” \n\n“No.” She seemed confused by the question. “I just didn’t want you playing alone in there. You could have easily gotten lost or hurt. I was just lucky you only ended up doing one of those.” \n\nShe looked at me curiously.\n\n“Did something happen in there you never told me about?” \n\n“No.” I shook my head. I wasn’t really lying. I’d told her the whole story about the day and the nightmare’s thereafter long ago anyway. It wasn’t really a lie. “The whole thing just really messed me up. I just still think about it sometimes.” I greatly downplayed how it affected me even then, of course. \n\nI had no convenient clues to go on, no mystery to face.\n\nOnly me, my dreams, and the woods. \n\nI’ve returned to the outskirts many times since. The trees are so remarkably mundane, that little patch of forest so remarkably dull it is almost hard to believe that misty glade lies inside. It took me weeks to build up the courage to step inside. \n\nDuring that time, I willingly chose to experience one more dream, this time as close as I could go to where it all started.\n\nI walked to the edge of the woods, laid myself down, and went to sleep. \n\nI woke up lost in the woods, nine years old, never moving, never changing.\n\nI clawed at the dirt. I scrambled over roots. \nThe world turned dark the monster chased me.\n\nEverything was nauseously familiar, even if my childhood brain could only grasp a fragment of it. \n\nThen, things changed. I somehow found myself broken free of the old woods. I was running home through familiar pine. A small, deeply hidden part of me knew that I was reaching something critical, that I was getting near something that would answer everything.\n\nMy one life and my other were finally nearing each other.\n\nThen, as light began to pierce to trees once more and I could see the edge of the woods, I was snatched back. I was pulled back into the darkness mere seconds from triumph. \n\nI woke up as I had a hundred times before: with a scream.\n\nIt was taunting me.\n\nIt can stop me from ever leaving those woods.\n\nAnd if it can hold me there forever more, then I have only one choice.\n\nI have stepped inside. As it whispers to me that I will never leave, I will answer loudly and with certainty that I will enter. \n\nI am writing this as the signal slowly fades with the sun's light as I step deeper and deeper amongst the trees. The only equipment this explorer needs for his expedition is a canister of gasoline and a lighter. \n\nI can’t live like this. Haunted.\n\nCursed.\n\nTrapped. \n\nI will step into that glade. I will tell them that I was just a boy, and I did nothing wrong. That I will be free. \n\nThere were witches in those woods.\n\nBut there will not be tomorrow.\n\nGoodbye.",

        "text": "Creation In Reverse\n\n\n\nThe first drawing came the morning before the first incident of sleep paralysis. What I thought was sleep paralysis. \n\n\nI awoke in the middle of the night to a dark figure standing over my bed. I had read about sleep paralysis and wasn’t very frightened, not even when I realised I couldn’t move. The figure reached down toward my face and, almost predictably, I struggled to breathe. I focused on relaxing and trying to close my eyes, hoping to return to sleep. And it worked. I forgot the shadowy figure and the moment entirely until the next morning, when I was eating breakfast and watching the news.\n\n\nI live alone and wasn’t expecting anyone. Mail dropped right into the slot is a thing of the past, except for flyers, which I always toss into the recycling bin anyway. An envelope, the same yellow beige colour as one I'd received yesterday and didn't look at, was on the mat. I didn’t go to the door immediately to see what had been left, thinking nothing of it, but only considered it more thoroughly upon noticing the similarity to the previous, when I was about to leave for work. \n\n\nA little curious, because I knew a nearly identical envelope currently sat in my recycling bin under the kitchen sink, I opened the second envelope and found a page folded into thirds. When I unfolded the paper, I saw a drawing in blue ink of a man and woman, naked but with a fig leaf covering their genitals, and long hair over the breasts of the woman. Adam and Eve. I rubbed my thumb against the ink and could tell, I’m not sure how exactly, that the drawing was not a copy but an original, which I think made it more personal. \n\n\nA religious nut had left it to be sure, I concluded. Someone with apparent artistic skill but no literacy because no words communicated the intent. A woman living alone, unmarried, could be construed as scandalous and unnatural to those keen on Jesus. I had gone to church as a child and given it up the second I entered university. \n\n\nDespite the time and the bus I would likely miss if I didn’t leave soon, I went to the kitchen and retrieved the first envelope, which now had a grease stain.\n\n\nThe first picture made less sense to me, at first, and it wasn’t until I was on the bus, riding to work, that I realized what the image might mean - an indistinct, humanoid giant, black but outlined with ethereal light with its or His back turned on a very tiny, yet still detailed, Planet Earth.\n\n\nOn the seventh day, God rested. And, according to the image I studied on the bus, turned away from humans and his creation. Perhaps, the deity moved on into space, which I suppose he also created? \n\n\nI almost crumpled the drawing up. Religious nonsense. Maybe fringe religious nonsense too. Could be dangerous. I packed both drawings into a single envelope and kept it in my bag, just in case more drawings arrived and the situation escalated into illegal territory. \n\n\nThe following night, I had my second bout with sleep paralysis, and it went more predictably and easier than before. The shadowy figure reached down. I struggled to breathe. I closed my eyes, and fell asleep. \n\n\nThe only notable difference the next morning was a bit of soreness in my jaw, from clenching my teeth or grinding them perhaps. I thought maybe the sleep paralysis had stressed me out more than I first accepted and resolved to make a doctor’s appointment. My job as a school librarian had been incredibly boring since day one, and, with Covid, had recently become redundant. Students weren’t allowed in the library, so I sat there most of the day alone with nothing to do, which might sound great, at first, but isn’t after the first few weeks of reading books, watching TV, etc. There wasn’t much other staff in the building either for many of those months. Learning was online and only a few custodians had been left behind to look after and maintain the building. Still, I had been instructed to report to work and the library. Living alone made the isolation worse too, of course. \n\n\nThe third envelope containing an ink drawing arrived the next morning. I rushed to the door, flung it open, and practically leapt onto the concrete stoop to see if I could spot the deliverer. Along the street, there were a few early commuters already, but I recognized them, and only one person stood out, a woman in a faded, dirty windbreaker with tangled, greasy hair sticking out from a fishing hat. \n\n\nI knew her too, somehow, but couldn’t immediately place the avalanche of layered track pants and sweat shirts and different coloured rags tied at wrists and ankles. \n\n\n“Excuse me!” I called and her pace quickened, becoming a jog for a few steps before slackening again into a stiff and awkward retreat. “Ma’am! Ma’am! A moment!”\n\n\nShe stopped so suddenly I almost collided into her back. Then she spun around fast, gracefully even. Her open mouth held darkness, a purplish worm tongue, a vomit stench, and tiny, black screws jutting from swollen, diseased gums, the remnants of dental implants, smashed out and pulled violently. \n\n\nI realised where I knew her from, the stairs leading down to the bus station, where she begged on occasion. \n\n\n\"Did you-\" I started to ask about the envelopes, but then she screeched, the noise of a thunderous gun shot, her bulging throat reloading another. She lunged at my face with dirt filled fingernails. I was saved by panicking and falling onto the sidewalk. When I removed my forearm from my eyes, I saw the homeless woman walking away again, in a hurry. \n\n\n\"Crazy bitch,\" an older man, built like a fit, hip Santa Claus said as he reached down and took my hand without asking, pulling me up and onto my feet. \"Never seen her do something like that before. Poor soul.\" He shook his head and took off running, a jogger, another featured character in my life but out of the usual context. I saw him most mornings but from a greater distance, a part of the scenery, not a person who could speak and help me up after being attacked by another supporting character, also not where my mind said they ought to be. \n\n\nI went back in the house, locked the door and decided to call in sick to work. As I put down my cell, I noticed it: A barely visible boot tread imprinted in the loose dirt of the mat by the door. I don't own any such boots and the size of the foot exceeded mine by inches. The print disintegrated when I crouched to get a closer look. My toe bumped today's envelope, scattering the dirt and then I was sure I had imagined the boot print anyway.\n\n\n\"Crazy...\" I did not repeat Hip Santa Claus' description of the homeless woman. Swearing is too crass. But the sentiment, even in thought, helped to pin down the disruption she had caused. She was crazy. I don't know why she had chosen me for her strange drawings but then maybe it was vain to assume I was the only one. Maybe the whole neighbourhood got personalised and vaguely religious ink judgments. I could ask if I ever ran into a neighbour, not that I likely would. Covid kept most people inside and usually far apart. Hip Santa had been taking a risk by doing the decent thing helping me up. I had never introduced myself to the neighbours when I first moved in, long before covid.\n\n\nDespite the morning disturbance, I had a lovely day, reading and drinking tea and a grey sky eventually thundering and pouring, filling the streets and gutters, drowning ideas of going outside with common sense: No one should leave the house in such weather. Best to stay in and finish your book.\n\n\nThe night brought sleep undisturbed and I felt rested and revived the next morning, and no envelope slipped through the mail slot. All was well again or so I thought.\n\n\nThe next night I awoke to the shadowy figure again, paralyzed but not deaf. The previous episodes had been silent, as far as I can remember, but then maybe I had chosen to forget the ominous whispers in the dark.\n\n\n\"And then you will choose me,\" the figure hissed, troubled by something beneath its hand, breathing heavily through a mask I thought. \"To erase another of your chosen, great one, is not blasphemy because nothing is holy to you.\" Pressure fell against my chest, my face and I tried to speak, to protest, but couldn't get my tongue to work. It felt heavy, blocked, like the inside of my mouth had been filled with foreign objects. Or one big object. \n\n\nThe figure seemed to writhe and something seemed to be forcing open my jaw. I panicked and tears washed my cheeks and spilled over my lips but I could not taste them. It laughed, a wicked, guttural, dehumanising expression, and brought its approximation of a face to hover close enough to smell sweat and something burning, not wood but something more primal. I had smelled it before and would again but for the moment I could not place it. \n\n\nThe episode ended the same as before. I fell asleep and woke up more tired. My jaw felt very sore and appeared a little swollen when I looked in the mirror. It was time to see a doctor. \n\n\nBut then I heard the squeaky hinge on the mail slot door announce the arrival of the third envelope. I opened my door and peeked carefully around the corner to see the same homeless woman walking away quickly. \n\n\nI called into work again and got a joke from the secretary about not bothering to call \"because who would notice?\" I came in through a direct entrance to the school library and left the same way. So of course I didn't see anyone often. Neither did she and the joke, I'm sure, had been about all of us in general but it felt personal at the time so I hung up without saying goodbye.\n\n\nThe conversation with the doctor's office had been equally uplifting. An appointment couldn't be arranged for two months and would probably be virtual. \n\n\n\"Unless you want to speak with the nurse practitioner,\" the receptionist ventured. \n\n\n\"Can she prescribe medication?\" I asked bluntly.\n\n\nSilence. Then, \"um, yes.'\n\n\n\"Wonderful,\" I answered. She would call at 3 PM. Between the morning and then, I sat in the kitchen, clutching a seemingly eternal cold cup of coffee and pondering the third image, alongside the other two, placed in sequence of their arrival: God turning away from his creation; Adam and Eve, fig leaves intact; fish and birds filling a lined page in every available spot. \n\n\nThe drawings were clear but crude, drawn by a novice, not meant to inspire but for exposition. What could be meant by delivering the days of creation in reverse? Was the world to be unmade? Was I?\n\n\nPerhaps drugs would help. The nurse called at three as promised. \n\n\n\"I've never heard of anyone with sleep paralysis waking up with a swollen jaw,\" the nurse explained calmly, trying to be calm, trying to ensure I remained calm. \n\n\n\"Have you had many patients with sleep paralysis?\" I inquired respectfully \n\n\n\"More than you'd think. Uh, to me this sounds like the paralysis is only a part of your sleep troubles especially if you say you're waking up tired. Have you noticed anything in your house moved or disturbed when you wake up?\" \n\n\nThe boot print came to mind. \"Why do you ask?\"\n\n\n\"Could be sleep walking.\"\n\n\n\"But why would my jaw-\"\n\n\n\"People can do almost anything when they sleep walk. I knew a kid who jumped through a window. Cut her up and she almost died.\" \n\n\nI was beginning to panic. \"Well what should I do? What do you recommend?\" \n\n\n\"I'm not a specialist. I can give you a referral-\"\n\n\n\"That'll take months,\" I snapped, \"Please help me.\" I'm sure I sounded crazy because she asked me to take some deep breaths and talk to her some more to make sure I hadn’t neglected to tell the full story. \n\n\n\"And the pictures keep coming in the mail?\"  She was doing her best to keep the doubt and judgement out of her voice. I could hardly believe it. \"Stress can make people emphasise the importance of, well, unimportant things.  If you weren't so tired you'd probably write it all off on some religious nut.\"\n\n\nHearing myself unintentionally quoted helped and I began to relax. The nurse wrote a prescription for a sleep aid. \"And you might want to visit a dentist if you've been grinding your teeth so much your jaw is swelling. Just to be sure it's not the early signs of infection. If it is, they'll give you antibiotics.\" \n\n\n\"Thank you.\" I felt much better, aside from the ache in my mouth, and decided to be proactive and call the dentist. Covid restrictions had shuttered a lot of offices but not mine, luckily, though there were a number of restrictions making appointments hard to come by. After hearing the details of my condition, however, and the possibility of infection, the receptionist somehow made space that afternoon.\n\n\nIn the chair, as it lowered and sprawled into a lounger, the muscles in my chest and face seized and I panicked, visibly. \n\n\n\"Whoa, easy,\" the doctor soothed. She'd been my dentist for years. There was nothing to be afraid of. I explained I'd been stressed lately and having trouble sleeping and she made a comment about the pandemic being hard on everyone, often without our knowing it. \n\n\n\"Open wide,\" she said, and I hadn’t really noticed the tension relaxing until then. But her face contorted with confusion and concern the moment she looked inside. \"Did you have an accident?\"\n\n\n\"Pardon?\" I murmured, tongue struggling to form words around latex fingers.\n\n\n\"Your front teeth appear to have been crowned,\" she said. I grasped the arms of the chair and accidentally bit the doctor. She retracted her hand and refrained from cursing. \n\n\nI apologised and the two of us discussed what she'd apparently discovered.\n\n\n\"I don't have crowns,\" I said. \"I've only ever had one cavity.\" I kept touching the new additions, trying to feel a difference. Breathing deeply became impossible. My swollen jaw. The figure over me. It hadn’t been sleep paralysis. \"Someone was in my house. Oh, fuck. No. It can't... I can't... why?\" \n\n\nThe doctor's eyes were wide open and she'd lowered her mask to publish her disbelief. \"How?\" She wondered. \"They would have had to drug you.\" \n\n\n\"Why?\" \n\n\nWe each seemed to prioritise motivation and logistics differently. \n\n\n\"I'm calling the police,\" she said. I didn’t object but didn't want her to leave the room. I was sinking beneath the panic. She shouted for the receptionist who then made the call. We waited and there wasn’t an ETA for the police so the minutes dragged.\n\n\n\"Okay,\" she said, gently, holding my hand, \"let me look again.\" \n\n\n\"For what? What?!\"\n\n\n\"Shh,\" she whispered, \"I just want to see about the resin they used... a crown... if done improperly could negatively impact your health. \" \n\n\n\"You want to see if I've been poisoned!\" I practically accused her. \n\n\n\"Not exactly,\" she promised, \"but let's just be double sure I shouldn't be calling for an ambulance too, okay?\" She reached into a cabinet and plugged in a device. \"This is a uv light, you might- oh...\"  The uv light, the black light, slipped from her gloves and hit the floor. \n\n\n\"What?! What is it?! What the fuck!?\" \n\n\nWe became hysterical and it took two police officers to calm us enough to explain and show what the dentist had found: Two days of creation had been tattooed to the crowns, the seventh - god rested - and the sixth - man and woman - in fluorescent paint. The mirror told me these images were identical to the ink drawings coming in the mail. The cops had never seen anything like it and I was so psychologically wiped out by that point, I just laughed and laughed like the world had ended and nothing but death remained. \n\n\nAfter a car ride and a series of interviews I can hardly remember, they placed me in a hospital room with an officer outside the door. Another or maybe a dozen watched my house for signs of the invader dentist. With generous amounts of drugs and liquor, I slept and woke up to the officer bearing news: No one had been spotted trying to enter my place. \n\n\nI saw doctors and more dentists over the next few days, and they said so many things that never penetrated the haze of drugs suppressing the madness trying to consume my brain. Gradually, very gradually, disbelief and panic dissipated and I felt the urge to get out of the room and walk and think and be alone.\n\n\nI declined the company of an officer to escort me to the drug store in the hospital, so I could buy a toothbrush and antiperspirant; one followed in plain clothes and at a distance anyway. \n\n\nSix days of creation. On the seventh, He rested. But the tattoos, the drawings had been made and delivered in reverse. An un-creation? Nothing about the invasion of my home, my mouth made sense and the invader, a skilled yet obviously insane dentist, accredited or not, had gone to great lengths to commit this deed. \n\n\nI ran my tongue over the crowns. \n\n\nShe came to mind next, she and her broken, dirty mouth. I skipped past the drug store and walked right out the door. The bus station isn't far, so neither was my house but police were there and the plainclothes officer still followed at a respectable distance, which emboldened me to confront the homeless woman, the deliverer of the drawings, the one with broken screws in her gums where crowns used to be.\n\n\nAs I descended the steps, I found her seated on a blanket, smoking a cigarette and openly drinking whisky from a plastic flask.\n\n\nWary, her bloodshot eyes studied my face and I hesitated, suddenly uncertain as to how to proceed. She raised her hand just as I was about to speak.\n\n\n\"You already know,\" she said. Then she turned away and leaned her head against the wall and closed her eyes, sleeping or pretending anyway. \n\n\nAnd she was right. I already knew. \n\n\nI went home. Told the officers to please leave, which they refused to do. It didn’t matter. He'd come tonight. The third drawing had been delivered. \n\n\nThe preparations were surprisingly swift. Then I waited by the window, blinds drawn, and a bright light behind me. Just past the wrong side of midnight, he appeared under an umbrella, an average sized shadow, features hidden inside his high collar. Only his eyes could I see and they flashed in the night like a cat's. \n\n\nHis tools, if he carried them, were nowhere in sight. He lingered on the sidewalk beneath my window and the police in the cruiser didn't seem to notice him at all. \n\n\nI showed him with a smile, the black screws where my front teeth and his tattooed crowns used to be, blood still pouring down my chin and into my throat. \n\n\nHe raised his index and pinkie fingers, the horns of the devil, and used them to tap his canines. Adults have thirty two teeth. I still had thirty. \n\n\nAny sense of victory, ideas of safety, were torn away in an instant. \n\n\nI knew what I had to do.\n\n\nI presented the pliers to him.\n\n\nThe devil's horns indicated his eyes. He would watch, to be sure.\n\n\nI nodded. It made sense. Silently we agreed, and I began with a canine, tearing the root and flesh, blood washing metallic salvation down my throat.\n\n\nThe sun rose and never touched the darkness of my empty mouth, my vacant soul.\n\n\nHe nodded and finally moved from where he'd stood the entire night, watching as I flayed my mouth clean to freedom. ",

        "text": "I don't remember much from my childhood, but I do remember my 9th birthday. It was the day my parents were killed, and I was left holding the murder weapon. I was confused, scared, and didn't understand what was happening. That's the earliest memory I have.\n\nI've always known that there was something different about me. Sometimes, I would wake up and not remember what had happened the day before. Other times, I would feel like I was a completely different person. It wasn't until I was diagnosed with Dissociative Identity Disorder that I started to understand what was going on.\n\nI have two personalities, or alters, as they're called. There's me, the \"normal\" one, and then there's the \"killer.\" The killer is a sociopath and a psychopath who enjoys killing and manipulation. When the killer takes over, I black out, and I can't remember anything that happened.\n\nIt's a terrifying feeling, knowing that there's this other part of me that's capable of such horrible things. But at the same time, I feel like I'm not fully in control of my own life. It's like I'm constantly fighting against this other part of me.\n\nThe worst part is that I don't know when the killer will take over. It could happen at any moment, and I wouldn't even know it. The people I've known, my relatives, my friends, my love. I try to keep myself busy, to distract myself from the fear and uncertainty that comes with living with DID. But it's always there, lurking in the back of my mind.\n\nIt was New Year's Eve, and I decided to go out and celebrate with my friends. We went to a party at a club, and I remember drinking a lot. The music was loud, the lights were flashing, and everyone was having a good time. But then something happened, and I don't remember what.\n\nThe next thing I knew, I was waking up in a hospital bed. The room was small, and the walls were painted a sickly shade of green. I was confused and disoriented, and it took me a few moments to realize that I was in an asylum.\n\nI tried to remember what had happened, but my mind was foggy. I couldn't recall anything after the party. I asked the nurses and doctors what had happened, but they wouldn't tell me anything. They just kept saying that I needed to rest and that everything would be okay.\n\nAs the days went by, I started to remember bits and pieces of what happened that night. I remembered feeling angry and frustrated, and then everything went black. I don't know what I did or who I hurt, but I know that it wasn't good.\n\nIt was then that they told me about the \"Personality Suppressor\". They said that I had agreed to it, that I had wanted to get rid of the killer alter. But now I'm not so sure. What if the killer is still there, lurking beneath the surface, waiting to come out again?\n\nI'm trapped here, in this asylum, with nothing but my thoughts and memories to keep me company. I don't know if I'll ever be able to leave, or if I even want to. All I know is that I'm scared, and I don't know what the future holds.\n\nAfter what felt like an eternity, I had grown a beard, and the nurses and doctors who had been taking care of me had come and gone. They were replaced by new faces, but they all seemed to treat me the same way. Like I was a prisoner, trapped in this asylum with no hope of escape.\n\nBut then something strange happened. One day, I woke up to find that the door to my room was open. I couldn't believe it. Had they finally come to their senses and decided to let me go?\n\nI cautiously stepped out of my room and looked around. The hallway was empty, but I could hear voices coming from down the hall. I slowly made my way towards the sound, my heart pounding in my chest.\n\nAs I got closer, I could see a nurse and a doctor standing outside of a room. They were talking quietly, but I could hear them saying something about a \"Personality Suppressor.\"\n\nMy blood ran cold. Was this it? Was this the moment they had been preparing me for? I tried to back away, to retreat back to my room, but it was too late. They had seen me.\n\nThe nurse and doctor turned to face me, and I could see the syringe in the doctor's hand. I knew what was coming next, and I braced myself for the worst.\n\nBut then something strange happened. The nurse stepped forward and said, \"Wait. We need to talk to you first.\"\n\nI was confused, but I nodded. They led me into a small room and sat me down at a table. The nurse looked at me with a serious expression.\n\n\"We've been reviewing your case,\" she said. \"And we've come to the conclusion that the Personality Suppressor might be the best option for you.\"\n\nI couldn't believe what I was hearing. After all this time, after everything I had been through, they were finally going to let me go?\n\nThe nurse continued, \"We think that with the right therapy and medication, you might be able to control your alters and live a normal life.\"\n\nI was overwhelmed with emotion. It was like a weight had been lifted off of my shoulders. For the first time in a long time, I felt like there was hope.\n\nAs I left the asylum, I knew that my journey was far from over. But I also knew that I had a chance to start over, to live a life free from the fear and uncertainty that had plagued me for so long. And for the first time, I felt like I might actually be able to do it.\n\nThe nurse and doctor approached me with the syringe, and I knew that this was it. This was the moment that would change everything. I closed my eyes and braced myself for the impact.\n\nAs the needle pierced my skin, I felt a rush of coldness spread through my body. Now, as I feel my consciousness fading, I realize that i- they've made a terrible mistake.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;**Man with Dissociative Identity Disorder Cleared of All Charges**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A man who was accused of multiple murders and crimes has been cleared of all charges after a court ruled that he had no control over his actions due to his Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The man, whose name has not been disclosed for privacy reasons, was diagnosed with DID after he was arrested for a series of violent incidents that occurred on New Year's Eve. He claimed that he had no memory of what he did and that another personality, whom he called \"the killer\", had taken over his body.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;DID is a mental disorder that causes a person to have two or more distinct identities or personalities that alternately control their behavior. The disorder is often triggered by trauma or abuse in childhood.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The man's lawyer argued that his client was not criminally responsible for his actions because he was suffering from a mental disorder that impaired his ability to appreciate the nature and quality of his acts or to know that they were wrong.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The prosecution argued that the man was faking his disorder and that he was fully aware of what he was doing. They presented evidence from witnesses, surveillance cameras, and forensic experts to prove his guilt.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;However, the jury sided with the defense and found the man not guilty by reason of insanity. The judge ordered him to be transferred to a psychiatric facility where he would receive treatment and supervision.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The man's lawyer said that his client was relieved by the verdict and hoped to recover from his disorder. He said that his client had agreed to undergo an experimental treatment called \"Personality Suppressor\", which aimed to eliminate or reduce the influence of unwanted personalities.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The treatment involved injecting the patient with a chemical compound that would block certain neural pathways in the brain. The lawyer said that his client had volunteered for the treatment as a way of atoning for his crimes and preventing any future harm.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The lawyer also said that his client had expressed remorse and sympathy for the victims and their families. He said that his client hoped to one day live a normal life without fear or violence.",

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is my first story, here goes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  I've always loved the forest, with it's bright and sunny mornings and the beautiful, bubbly, cerulean river. That is until I found a cabin in the forest a few weeks after graduation from Meadowsweet High. I had no interest in college as I wanted to explore, rediscover myself and homestead. I was hiking with my two best friends from childhood, Toni and Miranda in the forest as usual since it was one of our favorite get together activity.\n\n  \"Oh, wow, you guys have got to see this place, it looks wicked cool,\" Toni exclaimed as we came across it.  Miranda huffed in annoyance then whined, \"It's suuuper creepy. Andy, let's go.\" But I stare, mesmerized, at the  brown stone and brick cabin with moss and lichen growing in patches. \"No, let's explore it for a bit. Toni's right. It does look cool.\" We sauntered right up to the door, it was slowly getting dark. The door had a rusty door knocker in the shape of a horrified cherub. I opened the door, slowly. I first noticed the kitchen table. It had an old, wrinkled letter in purple cursive. I picked it up and read it.\n\n*To The New Owner:*\n\n*1. You cannot leave at night and you must not let anyone in. Leave offerings of special herbs\\* and a dead rat at dawn for the Ogre. at the base of the Great Oak.  It will keep him away at night. But be warned of the others.*\n\n*2. At night, you must eat a teaspoon* *of magic mushroom, beet root juice and dried bat blood immediately when you hear the blooodcurdling screams and banging outside the cabin. It will cast as a protective aura from the Mushroom Goblin. He craves your blood and organs and likes to make carpets from the hair and flesh of humans. He will sometimes be accompanied by other goblins.*\n\n*3.\\*If you ever find yourself out of special herbs, run to the river and cut your fingertips and drip the blood into the water. The entire river will turn crimson red. That is when you reach down and collect your herbs. Be careful not to fall in or be dragged in by the ghosts of those who perished in the forest.* \n\n*4. Always keep the fire stove alight at sunset until dawn.* \n\n*5. Never eat any food left on the doorstep. There is nobody...human...around for miles and it is poisoned and covered with hallucingenic powder. It will cause you to be sick and paranoid for a week. Blood will come out of your ears, you'll be foaming at the mouth while vomiting the foulest black sludge and your sick will look sickly green with purple lumps.* \n\n*6. Never go down in the larder.*\n\n*7.Give the scarecrow a coin coated in wax and wrapped with red string with a drop of your blood. Put it in the front chest pocket on his coveralls.*\n\n*8. Sage this home and draw a pentagram in acorn ash and rat blood.*\n\n*-Martha, The Guardian Witch of the Forest.*\n\nI read the last five a few times, at first thinking it was some kind of joke, not noticing it was already night outside. I would never have to worry about struggling. I would set aside most of the money every Monday to save it. Suddenly there was banging on the door and exterior wall. Oh sh\\*t! The teaspoon of cruddy sh\\*t! Miranda wailed in terror. She turned to me, clinging onto my sleeve. \"What the f\\*ck is happening, Andy? And what is that in your hands?\" She peered at the letter and giggled. \"You really can't believe that horsesh\\*t.\" The banging started getting louder then the screaming and shrieking started. Toni was about to open the front door. \n\n  \"No, Toni! Don't open the door or we'll all die!\" I shouted over the shrieking. But it was too late. As he opened the door, a  grey hand covered in oozing pus filled sore snatched him by the throat. The sight of the goblin's face will haunt me for the rest of my life. Its body was covered in dried blood and oozing pus filled sores and naked. It had malicious amber eyes and a evil sneering mouth filled with crooked yellow teeth stained with blood and the foulest breath. It had a huge red and purple mushroom cap it wore as a hat, covering its slimey green hair. Miranda screamed and vomited at the sight of it. The goblin smirked at us then snapped Toni's head backwards, a hole in his throat, blood dripping out. The goblin smirked at us again the began drinking from Toni as if he was a Slushee from a 7/11. \"Toni, nooooooo. Oh my god, no!\" Miranda wailed, sobbing. I looked at her then at the door. I rushed at it and slammed it shut before it tried to get us. \"Get the table, Mir!\" \n\n  Still sobbing, she dragged it over. \"Oh my god, what are we going to do?\" Miranda groaned as she slid down after we placed the table against the door, her head placed in her hands then sobbing again, her black ponytail jerking as she wept. \"First I'm going to look for some of the things mentioned in the letter. Then we have to ingest them.\" I opened the cabinets, searching around. \"Magic mushrooms, beet root juice and dried bat blood...ah there it is.\" I tried not to show my grief. I had to stay strong so we can get the h\\*ll out of here. Miranda lifted up a teaspoon after mixed the concoction, her hand shaking.\"D-do we really have to eat this? Oh my god, this is so gross!\" I tried to comfort her, after all she was now the only best friend I had left. \"If we want to get out of here alive, then yes we have to.\" I wasn't willing to eat it either but what other choice did we have? \n\n  We gulped the horrid concoction down, then a green aura emanated from us instantaneously. We decided to escape from the cabin but not before finding a few rats and killing them with a quick stomp then carrying them and the special herbs with us to hurry towards the Great Oak we saw earlier that day. We placed them at the base of the tree. \"What if it doesn't work?\" Miranda whimpered, biting her nails. She looked at me with fear and started clinging onto my arm. \"Let's hurry and get out of here-urrrrghhhh\" She was dragged off me and slammed onto the oak tree, her head bashed over and over by a 7'2 tall ogre with a dirty loin cloth made from a beaver skin which barely covered his kiwis, had greyish blue skin and long claws and fangs. Miranda's spine snapped on the next slam and she died instantly but the ogre didn't stop slamming her.  I tried not to cry then ran for my life. \"I'm so sorry, Miranda and Toni. \"I was halfway to the forest's exit when dawn came. I collapsed at the exit and sobbed until a helpful old man stopped his car and gave me a ride home. Miranda and Toni had closed  caskets since their bodies couldn't be recovered. I decided to go to college then start a family.",

        "text": "A tremendous amount of heavy thoughts troubled me that night. After leaving that prison glass where I worked a tedious 9 to 5 job, I needed to walk home. I took a deep breath, the stench of this city filling my nose. Rats the size of dogs scurried to safety inside metal trash bins or the sewers, junkies with their veins hanging from their arms barely held on to life, and I, a nobody, crumbled away under the weight of this monotonous, bleak life.\n\nIt didn’t bring me comfort thinking about tomorrow, no. *Alarm, wake up tired, mutter bad words, drink coffee, eat breakfast, take cold shower, brush teeth, dress nicely, put on a fake smile, and things would be A-okay*. Another day, another demise. One step closer to the end of the charade. What a spectacle! The crowd goes wild. Curtains fall. Lights out. Absolute silence.\n\n“Watch where you’re going, asshole!” a madman from a car yelled at me. I stopped and realized I was in the middle of the street. The car had hit the brakes a few inches away from my legs. The man continued cussing and honked. “You wanna get yourself killed, dickhead? Move out the fucking way!” \n\nI raised my hand and whispered sorry. He drove past me in a rush, the tires screeching violently. Lucky me.\n\nI walked, the dark thoughts beginning to fog my mind again with each step I took. The air smelled like piss and rotten eggs. It made me feel sick to my stomach. \n\nTime passed, and I became lost once again inside my head. After going where my feet took me, I found myself in a part of town I didn’t know. It seemed off-place, almost as if an unknown constructor took a part of a strange city and moved it here with its residents. Yet, the putrescence had not vanished. \n\nI glanced around the tall, undulating buildings. They all looked abandoned and inhabited at the same time. Some of the apartments had the lights turned on, and behind each window, I could see a shadowy silhouette studying me with wonder. Hundreds of eyes inspecting me as if I didn’t belong there. Whenever I looked at one of the windows, the person inside waved at me. Slowly, left and right, left and right. They all looked like human clocks, counting each second in that place.\n\nI wanted to turn back. But, instead, I glanced behind and saw that the street stretched out into the blackness, seemingly with no end. This place had me trapped there.\n\nA maelstrom of fear and despair began taking shape inside my heart. The more I stayed there, the more it felt like nothing was what it seemed. The mystery of this side of town extended its black and slimy tentacles at me, trying to wrap around my sanity and squeeze it until it would suffocate and leave me utterly mad.\n\nWith extreme caution and heightened senses, I moved forward into the strip of blackness. The stars above stared at me with contempt and disgust. They blinked as if an invisible hand of doom clicked them on and off. \n\nThe fear inside my chest spread its tiny claws, trying to grab whatever it could find. It screamed as if it wanted to shatter my heart into a million little pieces. A heart made of obsidian, its sharp parts collapsing on the floor of my soul as if a morbid symphony creaked its tune for the end of the world.\n\nApart from the people in the windows waving at me, I had seen no one else. Not a single soul, not even a car moving, nothing.  I walked for a few more minutes. Again, nothing moved, nothing breathed.\n\n*You’re trapped here, man. What the hell is going on?* I whispered to myself.\n\nI heard a buzzing sound growing louder as I approached a back alley. A man soiled in grease, wearing only a pair of black shorts, stood before an old TV set. I heard him muttering some words but didn’t understand what he said. At first, I was excited to see and hear from another fellow human being. However, he didn’t even acknowledge my presence as I approached him. \n\nI stood for a few moments behind me as the TV hypnotized him.\n\n“Yes, I am. Yes, I am. I am here. I am yours. Forever in your service, forever in your debt. You have made me what I am. Your child, your creation. You showed the true colors of this world. Master, I thank you for my life. Master, I will endure. I am nothing without you. My Master, My Lord, My God. I bow down to you forever,” he said, swaying to and fro like a puppet made of flesh and bone with no soul or mind.\n\n“Hey, can you hear me?” I asked.\n\nNothing. He just repeated all those words over and over and over again. He chanted them like in a ritual. Then he stopped all of a sudden. He froze, his gaze still on the TV.\n\n“No one is here. No, I didn’t betray you. Behind me? A man?” he said. I stepped back as the man rose and turned to face me.\n\nHe had static in his eyes. The buzzing was nauseating; behind all the crackling noise, a voice whispered terrible things to him. An evil agent that fed the poor man’s mind with toxic, infectious thoughts.\n\nThe man lunged at me. He grabbed my shoulders and squeezed hard. I froze as the static in his eyes grew louder. I didn’t feel in any danger, but the fear remained. Apart from his body, what he had inside was long gone and replaced with something artificial.\n\nThe supernatural was present in this man. An evil, powerful force twisted his mind and played with his soul until there was nothing. The puppeteer pulled the strings carefully until the man crumbled and served his master’s will.\n\n“You need to go now. Master Leonardo is waiting for you. He will give you the gift of knowledge. He will make you see beyond the veil of human perception. Right where this world ends, you will feel extraordinary sensations. Yet, Master knows how to make it all work. He can tap into that world and make you see amazing things. Just go,” the man spoke like a robot. He lifted his right hand and pointed upwards on the street.\n\nAfter my heart rate settled down, I looked at the end of the street. There I saw a flickering streetlight in front of what appeared to be an abandoned small house.\n\nThis, of course, felt unnatural to me. It seemed like that house had just manifested itself out of thin air. I was sure that in that place where only tall concrete apartment buildings seemed to exist—they felt more like prisons to me— a house would be the last thing anyone would build. Why would they? The whole scenery would suffocate it out of existence, infect it with the desolation of that place, and make it fade away and die.\n\nThe man returned to the TV set and began muttering the words in an unknown language. I walked the street until the end. Then, the flickering lamp post stopped working, and everything went pitch black. I heard the house creak and a door close shut. The lights turned on inside the house, and a tall silhouette stood behind the window. I couldn’t see who it was.\n\nA purple light buzzed and made the house come to life. The words LEONARDO SORPRENDENTE’S BOUTIQUE OF WONDERS appeared on the roof.\n\nThe front door opened.  The silhouette in the window waved its hand at me, then invited me over. I could make out a thin man wearing a top hat as I approached the house.\n\nI entered, the entrance bell chimed, and a bubblegum smell permeated the air. The man looked at me with black eyes and greenish-yellow teeth as if he had brushed his teeth with radioactive toothpaste. \n\nHe stood there motionless and smiling. The ravenous smile that spread from ear to ear had to be the most frightening thing I had ever seen. He wore a purple and orange pinstripe suit that made me dizzy. His long black hair hung on his shoulders in wet strands as if he had just emerged from a long-forgotten underwater cave. \n\n“Welcome to Leonardo Sorprendente’s Boutique of Wonders! You arrived just in time for our latest auction. Our lots this evening are of the rarest form, and I am sure you will be delighted to see them. Remember that all sales are final, and payments must be made at the end of the auction,” the man said. \n\nIn all this time, he didn’t move. Not even his lips moved when he talked. He stood there like a mannequin, and the voice came from a deep, dark place at the world’s end—his goddamn smile just never left his face.\n\n“Where am I?” I asked. “What is this part of town, this place? What’s all of this? Who are you?”\n\n“This place is hardly ever found by people. The lucky few here live happy lives and are cared for by me. I take care of everything and everyone. I am the master of this place you will call home. The man you met works for me. He is the only one allowed to roam the streets at night. You should have known that we have a curfew here. After 10 pm, no one is ever allowed outside except the Man with the TV. So that means you broke the only rule here,” the man with the funny suit said.\n\n“What? What the hell’s going on?” I replied. My head spun around, and dizziness took hold of my body. Then, I heard the door lock by itself.\n\n“Your unwillingness to follow the rules is infuriating. You will be punished accordingly, but first, you must participate in this auction.  It is of the utmost importance that you do so”, the devil-man reiterated.\n\n“Let me out of here. I want to leave,” I said. I tried to run for the door but couldn’t move. \n\n“Stop resisting. You will not leave here if you continue disobeying what I say!” the man shouted. His voice deafened me. It felt like he threw broken shards of glass into my ear, making it bleed inside.\n\nHis arms suddenly extended toward me. Monstrous claws replaced his fingernails, and his once pale cancerous skin turned a dark gangrenous hue.\n\nLike tentacles from hell, they grabbed my head and squeezed. I could feel the life flying away from me, and death’s cold embrace was the only logical outcome. The last thing I saw before my mind went black was his demented grin, but this time a bloody crimson hue painted over his face. The small rivers of blood that came from my eyes made me feel like some stigma in reverse.\n\nI woke up in a glass tank, like a live human exhibit. The man sat behind an old mahogany desk. It smelled like incense, the heavy aroma making me sick to my stomach, even more than I already was. I regained my consciousness but couldn’t just open my eyes yet. The air reeked of incense, the heavy aroma making me sick to my stomach, even more than I already was.\n\nWelcome to Bizzarro World.\n\nI opened my eyes and saw the man standing behind an old mahogany desk. Black candles adorned the rims of the desk. The man hit the surface of the desk with a wooden hammer.\n\nI screamed and banged against the glass. The man just looked at me with his enormous evil grin. His eyes told me that help wouldn’t come. \n\nI saw a few empty chairs in front of me. This insanity kept growing like a tumor.\n\n“Good evening, ladies and gentlemen! Welcome to this year’s auction!” he shouted, standing up.\n\nNow, on the chairs, plastic mannequins appeared out of thin air. Some stood with their arms up, others seemed to worship their master, while I, captive inside my glass prison, watched all the events unfolding before me. \n\n“As you can see, this year’s lot is this young man right here — our newest citizen is up to you to bid as you see fit. Starting at $10000!” the man shouted.\n\nNothing came from the room.\n\n“$10001! Going once, going twice, and sold to myself! Hahahaha!” the man burst out laughing. “Welcome, young man, to your new home!”\n\nThe glass broke, and millions of tiny pieces hit my face and skin. The bleeding lacerations disfigured me. The man shattered my soul, an empty void now growing inside me. All faded to black. I woke up in a room with cracked walls and giant bugs walking around slowly. For a brief moment, I thought I heard a chainsaw-like noise. The bed was filthy, and water dripped in the mold-infested bathroom. It felt like a countdown to the end of my days. A dying rat convulsed in the corner of the room.\n\nI exited the room and saw that I was in Apartment 23. The building felt deserted as I was the first and last tenant there.  Descending the stairs of this hellish place, I managed to get out outside. A chair and TV guarded the night in the middle of the street. \n\n“Sit down,” an ethereal voice instructed me. With no will left to live, I followed the order. I was too afraid not to comply.\n\nEverything went black.\n\nI woke up screaming and gasping for air. I looked around and saw what resembled a hospital room. A doctor came running and told me to calm down. I got hit by a card and projected into a large glass pane that stood unattended on the sidewalk. All those little glass cuts still hurt my skin.\n\nBut something changed. Even now, sometimes, I can hear static in the middle of the night. \n\nBuzzing. Electric. Metallic droning. An eerie murmuring trying to get inside my head.\n\nAs if an unknown [entity](https://www.reddit.com/r/PostMortem33/comments/gpnh5h/story_masterpost/) is trying to drive me insane.",

        "text": "I recall, almost word for word, the telephone call which had informed me that Laney had disappeared: her teacher, calm, unbearable, all saccharine platitudes and reassurance, my own voice fraught and strangled with an instant and instinctual panic.\r\n\r\nAt that time I had only just emerged, inwardly bruised and outwardly haggard, from a two year custody battle with my ex husband, who had dogged me through the courts not out of any particular interest in Laney, whom he had always handled with a stranger's cold unfeeling, but to harangue me to the point I felt half-mad, my penance for refusing to yield to the man’s more violent torments.\r\n\r\nOur daughter was the only beautiful thing that I had gleaned from our decade together, and I cleaved to her— my prize, my love—with such ferocity that each time I dropped her off at school in the morning I would sit in the parking lot and shake with a passionate dread of anything happening to her in the hours she was not in my care.\r\n\r\nAll parents know the power of imagined horrors: the kidnapper idling on every corner in the sinister white shell of a van, the teacher alone in a vacant classroom, the husband with quick and vicious fists loitering at the school gates to whisk the unwitting child away.\r\n\r\nAll these things and more cavorted my mind in a grim and raucous glee as I answered the call from Laney's teacher, knowing with the psychic sureness of any mother that Something Was Wrong.\r\n\r\n\"It's alright, Ms Cameron,\" said Miss Paxton, whom I'd always found to be an insipid and distinctly useless character. \"I'm sure Laney just wandered off and got a little confused trying to find her way back to the group. The park rangers are all out looking for her. I'm sure she'll be found in no time at all.\"\r\n\r\nIt was all I could do not to scream a dozen accusatory questions down the line.\r\n\r\nHow could you lose her? Isn't it your job to take care of the class? Don't you know that there are savage animals, and deep water, and steep drops out there in the wilderness? Haven't you thought about that the way I have, agonised like I have, suffered and yearned to save the innocent from all the colours of horror in the world?\r\n\r\n\"She's only ten years old, for God's sake,\" I snapped, through gritted teeth. \"She must be terrified.\"\r\n\r\nYet even as I said it I knew the most dangerous thing was that Laney wouldn't be frightened at all.\r\n\r\nShe had always been a placid, adventurous child, undeterred from her exploratory whims by scratches and bruises, nor by being separated from me, or any other guardian.\r\n\r\nI recall losing her in a shopping mall at the heights of the festive season, finding her—after three hours of tearful searching—by a water fountain, tossing nickels she'd found in one lint filled pocket down into the verdigris depths.\r\n\r\n\"Hi, Mom,\" Laney had said, her blonde eyebrows raised with a cool, adult surprise at my distress. \"I'm making a wish. Think it'll come true?\"\r\n\r\nThrough luck and my meticulous care nothing truly terrible had ever happened to my daughter. No wonder, then, that she could not conceive of herself at the centre of such an event; disaster was, to Laney, a distant fairy tale, the Rumpelstiltskin that only came for other children, of another time.\r\n\r\nYet these ills had indeed now taken her, and as I languished by the phone awaiting another call I pictured a thousand scenarios, each more sickening than the last.\r\n\r\nIt didn't help matters that the National Park in which Laney had disappeared was notorious for missing persons reports and other unsavoury incidents, many of which were quietly supressed from local news. I had, of course, vehemently opposed the school's decision to include a visit to the area as part of the new curriculum, appalled to find myself bullied into acquiescence by principal and board alike.\r\n\r\nThus, upon finding my neurosis vindicated, I could only logically assume that my grislier fantasies would be confirmed in a like fashion. I was no retentive paranoiac, the hysteric archetype of the crumbling woman: looking back, I might argue my suspicions  were but pangs of psionic foresight, a sense that would step forth from shadowed peripheries in the following days, and make itself their heart.\r\n\r\nSmoking cigarette after cigarette in fractious helplessness I envisioned, darkly, the face of Laney's father upon receiving the news of her death, like the mask of some malevolent pagan God. He'd sup greedily from the liquor of my grief, the denouement of his daughter’s existence nothing to him but a tool to eviscerate a reaction from me.\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly, the phone rang again, causing me to jump so violently that I spilled ash down the front of my dress.\r\n\r\n\"Good news, Ms Cameron. Laney turned up, and she's just fine.\"\r\n\r\nI pressed a hand to my mouth, unsure whether I was going to vomit or burst into tears.\r\n\r\n\"What happened?\" I asked. \"Where did you find her?\"\r\n\r\nThere was an odd little laugh on the other end of the line.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's sort of strange,\" said Miss Paxton. \"One of the rangers found her at the bottom of a seven foot hole in a meadow— it looked to be a burrow of some kind. Lord knows what made it. Laney must have just fallen in by accident. We've looked her over, and luckily she doesn't have even a scratch on her. If you'd like to pick her up she's fine to go home. As I said, she's not injured, just a little shaken up, is all.\"\r\n\r\nI got into my car and drove the hour long journey to the park, so soaked in the adrenaline of relief that I was like a dreamer, watching my white hands curl in spidering husks upon the wheel. \r\n\r\nWhen I pulled up to the park ranger's station an officer was loitering out front beside Miss Paxton, who was holding the hand of a small blonde child with a firmness that suggested it might run away from her the moment she let go. The little figure stood with its back to me, short-haired and androgynous as an elf, staring off into the forest, as though watching something move in the trees.\r\n\r\nThe other kids milled about nearby, their eyes flat and aloof. I noticed they gave the light-haired child a wide berth, which, had it been Laney, would have been strikingly unusual, being that she made friends easily, and was close to a group of five other girls in her class. Not one of them looked at or spoke to her, loitering at the vertices of the clearing, whispering amongst themselves \r\n\r\nAs I got out of the car I saw the blonde child twist at Miss Paxton's arm, attempting to dislodge itself and wander off into the woods. Although the hair was right, and it was wearing a similar outfit to that which I'd set out for Laney that morning, nothing in its body language was reminiscent of my daughter, whose loose-shouldered, tomboyish posture I would have recognised at once.\r\n\r\nWas there some mistake? Had this idiot of a teacher somehow confused Laney with some other, unknown child?\r\n\r\nMiss Paxton turned towards me with a welcoming smile, which wavered as she caught my expression. The thin little child-stranger swivelled awkwardly on her arm, still wanting to go in the other direction.\r\n\r\n\"Laney,\" said the teacher, brightly. \"Look! Your mom's here.\"\r\n\r\nShe spoke as she might to an infant, and from this I gleaned there was something amiss she hadn't deigned to tell me over the phone. Pressing a hand to the small of the child's back, she ushered it forwards, and at last its face turned towards me, no more familiar than its posture had been.\r\n\r\nI suppose the girl looked enough like Laney that anyone might mistake them at a passing glance, but that was all. This child's eyes were spaced further apart, the mouth small and cruel, the nose thinner, and missing the aquiline shape she inherited from me; it was as though Laney's own face had been drawn from memory, and a poor one at that.\n\nCousins they could easily be, but the same child they were not, and I was amazed that the teacher that saw her five days a week could possibly think them identical.\r\n\r\nIt was as I glanced up into the young woman's shifting eyes behind her glasses that I realised she didn't believe it, not really. Now it seems to me that what she perceived was so beyond her understanding that she had simply elected to place her trust in the most logical explanation, yet not the correct one.\r\n\r\nThen, however, I merely assumed that she was lying to me for some nefarious purpose, and found myself coolly unsurprised. The world had always seemed set against me and my daughter; why, then, would the person entrusted to care for my only child be any different?\r\n\r\n\"What is this?\" I asked, harshly. \"Where's Laney?\"\r\n\r\nMiss Paxton's face drained of colour, and she stammered through a few brittle sentence starters, unable to finish even one. The girl that wasn't my daughter twitched and fussed in her grip, her pale eyes as indifferent to my presence as the sea to the swimmer it drowns.\r\n\r\nI was both repelled and fascinated by her, this tiny usurper held against her will.\r\n\r\n\"Ms Cameron,\" said the ranger. “Talk with me in the station a second.”\r\n\r\nShe was a thin, short-haired woman, hard with corded muscle, and speaking in the sharp, almost Germanic accent that was common to some of the nearby towns.\r\n\r\nI wanted to refuse the ranger’s offer, rally angrily against her with all the obstinance my fear and anguish could lend me. But in the end I went after her, looking back over my shoulder at the unfamiliar child, who flinched and jolted at the end of the school teacher's arm like a condemned man in a rain of artillerant fire. \r\n\r\nThe ranger, whose name was Dianne Becker, sat me down in a rickety chair and brewed me a cup of coffee so black that I almost retched at the first swig.\r\n\r\n\"Who is that kid out there?\" I asked. \"She isn't my daughter. Was it you that found her?\"\r\n\r\n\"My colleague,\" said Becker, flatly. \"She's off shift. I'll get you her number if you wanna talk to her. But anyway, I was there when Mel brought the kid back to the station. Had this with her. The teacher recognised it.\"\r\n\r\nThe ranger picked up a purple, rainbow print backpack from a nearby desk and pushed it towards me, watching blandly as I touched the name tag and ferreted through the contents— the workbooks with their untidy handwriting, the uneaten packed lunch, the pencil case, whose utensils were all nibbled surreptitiously at their ends.\r\n\r\n\"It's your daughter's?\" asked Becker, with the intonation of a statement.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I said, reluctantly. \"But it doesn't matter. That girl out there? I've never seen her before in my life. Laney is still missing.\"\r\n\r\nBecker regarded me without expression.\r\n\r\n\"So you're saying a kid turned up with your daughter's description, wearing her clothes, carrying her stuff... but it ain't your daughter?\"\r\n\r\nI knew how it sounded, but hearing it echoed back in that detached monotone made me want to scream out in frustration. Instead I pulled my cell phone from my pocket and shoved it at Becker, stabbing my finger at photographs and video clips of Laney as the ranger looked on with cool, dispassionate eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Look,\" I said. \"That's my baby. That's what she looks like. That's her face. That girl your colleague picked up— they're not the same, can't you see that? And the kids in Laney's class: none of them know who she is, either. Why are you lying to me? What's going on?\"\r\n\r\nBut Becker only shrugged, her weathered face an impenetrable slab. \r\n\r\n\"I don't know what to tell you, Ma'am,\" she said. \"I'm not seeing the difference.\"\r\n\r\nI pinched the bridge of my nose, holding back the threatened tears.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not crazy, okay? There's been some kind of mix up. That girl's parents are probably frantic, looking for her.\"\r\n\r\nBecker shrugged.\r\n\r\n\"Haven't heard anything about that. Only missing kid this week is yours.\"\r\n\r\nThe helplessness I felt as I stared at the ranger was of such intensity that my vision swam like a desert heat at the edges, a white and crystalline blindness. Becker clearly noticed something amiss in my face, for she shoved the cooling coffee cup towards me and placed a coarse palm on my shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"If you think something's wrong maybe you ought to take the kid to a doctor,\" she said, gently. \"Get her looked over, you know?”\r\n\r\nLikely Becker thought me unstable, in shock, caught up in the sort of excitement that would die down in a day or two. There was nothing I could say to prove or defend myself, I saw that clearly.\r\n\r\nI stood up from the table, seizing Laney's backpack in a wretched burst of anger.\r\n\r\n\"She is not my daughter,\" I said, again. \"When I get to the bottom of this you'll hear about it, make no mistake.\"\r\n\r\nFor all my bluster I was hyperventilating as I shoved my way back out into the clearing again, every breath sawing up through my side like an animal bite.\r\n\r\nI don't remember how I went from this pitiful state to sitting with the strange child in the back of the car, driving mechanically along the road; I only recall staring at the little creature in the rear view mirror, looking desperately for something of Laney in its pale, furtive eyes, its twitching person, finding nothing.\r\n\r\nThere was no recognition in the sharp little features, no understanding of where it was, or what it was doing. I saw it wrestle with the seatbelt like a dog against its collar, put one grubby hand against the passenger window, as though expecting it to slip right through into the air beyond. I couldn't fathom where so wild and capricious and unthinking a child might have sprung from, and despaired that through the stupidity of others it had been thrust upon me.\r\n\r\nThrough a great amount of wheedling and pressure I was able to wrangle an emergency check up appointment with Laney's paediatrician, a weary middle-aged woman who'd handled my daughter's case so many times over the past five years I had no doubt that she, at least, would recognise the grave mistake that had been made when I presented her with the little stranger.\r\n\r\nIt was a trial cajoling the child out of the car into the doctor's office. It only glared with a beady, crow-like malice and attempted to dart past me, prevented only by my hand at its elbow. The arm was all sinew and bone beneath its jacket, soft as twigs under wet leaves; I gave a short cry of disgust, and forced myself to cling on, lest the child flee across the parking lot and into the busy road.\r\n\r\nWhile not Laney, it was a little girl, and my maternal instinct to protect life still remained. I kept the stranger close to my side as I pushed it through the office door, wrinkling my nose at the scent of dirt and wet grass that lingered on the child's hair and clothes.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what I anticipated upon presenting it to Dr Maddox— arched eyebrows, perhaps, asking where Laney was, if I was caring for a young relative for the day. Yet there was no such surprise, only the usual greeting and tepid professionalism with which she carried out every appointment.\r\n\r\nAs per my request she enacted a full body examination, including of the teeth— I had some notion, from true crime media, that the identity of the stranger might be unearthed that way.\r\n\r\nThe child was obstinate throughout, not with aggression so much as an aversion to touch, writhing about with a lithe, ferrety determination. I dithered, unsure whether to feel embarrassed or disconcerted.\r\n\r\nThe doctor seemed unsurprised by the display, however, going about her work with prosaic method. Only when the child was allowed to slip from the examination table and hunch, all elbows and knees, in one corner did Dr Maddox take me aside for a hushed conversation.\r\n\r\n\"Ms Cameron, why did you bring Laney in to see me today?' she asked, in tones of brittle neutrality.\r\n\r\nThe truth would sound akin to madness; aware of this, I only said, \"I was wondering if you'd noticed a... physical difference in Laney, since you last saw her.\"\r\n\r\nDr Maddox glanced at the child, who stared out of a nearby window, observing a small bird cleaning its wings in a tree.\r\n\r\n\"It's not her physical health that worries me,\" she said. \"The behavioural changes, however— the mutism, the restlessness. I have to ask: has anything... new happened at home?\"\r\n\r\nThis being a delicate, euphemistic reference to the divorce, to Laney's father.\r\n\r\n\"Not at home, no,\" I said, carefully. \"Earlier today there was an incident on a school trip. Laney wandered off, had some kind of accident. She's been like this since then. Not talking, doesn't respond to anything I or anyone else says. She's totally changed. It doesn't make sense.\"\r\n\r\nDr Maddox made a sound of gentle understanding, and in it I lost all hope of support, of being heard, \r\n\r\n\"Sometimes it's the little things that trigger a reaction that's built up from earlier incidents,\" she said. \"A delayed reaction. It may seem sudden, but all things considered it makes sense. I can recommend a psychologist to look into this better than I can.\"\r\n\r\nI imagined the child crouching, silent and unpleasant as a hobgoblin, while I was pressured into lying to another clueless professional.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I said. \"No, thank you. Not today.\"\r\n\r\nIgnoring the concern in Dr Maddox's eyes, I turned to the stranger we were pretending was Laney. Inexplicably it struck me that perhaps it was not even a child at all– an unsettling thought, bidden from the oddness and mystery of the circumstances, yet one that lingered, all the same.\r\n\r\n\"Come on,\" I said to it, in a hoarse voice.\r\n\r\nThe child's head twitched, but it only continued its watch of the window, its thin mouth slightly ajar. Then, as I reached towards it the head turned, and I thought for one hideous moment that it was going to bite my arm with its perfect little teeth.\r\n\r\nI froze, not knowing what to do, too frightened and too appalled by the thought to strike it, too stunned to move away.\r\n\r\nAt last the child stood, and when I stepped towards the door it followed, allowing me, with a short twitch, to take its clammy hand, little though I wanted to.\r\n\r\nIt was in the car park that I had my first truly unkind thought towards the stranger. Not of harming it, merely of leaving the child there, where it would be found, and driving away.\r\n\r\nBut I knew it was impossible. I'd be arrested for child abandonment and endangerment, institutionalised, perhaps. There would be no end to my accountability, for I could not defend myself when the only other being that might have spoken in my favour had uttered not one word, nor seemed remotely capable of doing so.\r\n\r\nSo it was that I took the little stranger home, feeling more resentful of her presence—of her replacing Laney—with every passing minute.\r\n\r\nI ended up cooking something for dinner with the stiff, mindless process of an automaton, caring little whether or not the child would like what I set on its plate.\r\n\r\nIt would neither sit at the table nor consider the cutlery, squatting behind one of the chairs to look at me through the slats, its face spliced into irregular oblongs by each wooden spoke. The effect of this was that I could imagine even less how the individual pieces could ever come together to resemble Laney's features, each of an unnatural difference from hers.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\" I hissed, across the now gelid dinner. \"Where is my daughter? Why are you here, and not her?\"\r\n\r\nThe child slid away from the chair and against the back door, scuffling like a hound plagued by worms. \r\n\r\n\"Alright,\" I said, sharply, standing up from my place with a screech of chair legs upon tiles. \"Go outside. Play. Something.\"\r\n\r\nI unlocked the door and ushered the stranger out across the back yard, relieved that it went out without event, allowing me my first moment alone.\r\n\r\nThe inescapable bind of my situation overwhelmed me, and again I collapsed into my chair, leaden as a coin dropped into some fathomless well. \r\n\r\nI missed Laney terribly, thinking forlornly what a beautiful, simple afternoon it would be if she were still here, kicking her dirty sneakers off under the table with a sighing affectation of grown-up tiredness. She would have shown me a rock or flower she'd found on her trip—which I would pretend a dutiful fascination in—and cleared her plate of food in fifteen minutes before managing to thieve a double helping from my own, her boyish, playful irreverence overshadowing the very light in the room.\r\n\r\nRemembering her hammered home ever plainly that the creature I'd brought back from the park was not Laney, and as I stood up to look at the girl from the kitchen window I wondered, with a twisting repulsion, what sort of parents had managed to raise such offspring.\r\n\r\nA light rain had fallen; unperturbed, the child knelt at the edge of a flower bed, digging with both hands in the wet soil.\r\n\r\n\"Hey,\" I said, sharply. \"What are you doing?\"\r\n\r\nAs I stepped outside, one arm raised to shield my hair from the rain, I saw that a number of worms and other insects were churning about in the dirt, as though the child's very digging had drawn them up, like a sea gull's dance. Disconcerted, I leant down to pull the girl away, then stopped, a guttural cry jarring my chest.\r\n\r\nThe child was shovelling handfuls of the infested soil into its mouth, stones, weeds, and clods of earth alike vanishing into the greedy pit of its throat. Brown and bloody spittle hung from the thin lips in swinging strands, and I was horribly amazed that the little white teeth did not break as they ground down on grit and decorative pebbles.\r\n\r\n\"No!\" I snarled, and with a feat of strength I didn't know I possessed I hoisted the squirming beast under one armpit and carried it back into the house, up to the bathroom.\r\n\r\nThe chaos of undressing the stranger and thrusting its pale body under the shower head was like a scene from some Victorian asylum, although conducted in an uncanny, scuffling silence that perturbed me more than if the child had screamed. I let go of it and leant, panting with exertion, against the bathroom wall, wondering grimly why I had bothered, why I was still engaging with any of this.\r\n\r\nThe child looked balefully at me from under a sodden cap of yellow hair, its cut mouth still. My eyes rooted to its pale ears, nudging from behind dripping fronds; their tips were sharp, like white flint, unfamiliar. Another wrongness, another indicator that the girl wasn't mine.\r\n\r\nStill, I deposited it in Laney's bedroom for the night, there being no other space in the small house in which to have it sleep. It turned my stomach to think of the feral, silent child touching my daughter's things, leaving its damp scent on her stuffed animals, her pillows, the sheets.  \r\n\r\nTwitching and unsettled by every perceived sound from Laney's room, I imagined the child gnawing at the walls and crawling through them like a rat, or sickness in a dying tree. I tossed and turned until my pillow was flat and my hair tousled upright. In the end I withdrew the cigarette carton I kept hidden at the back of my sock drawer and smoked to the end of the pack.\r\n\r\nWhen morning came, white and sore as a scar, I went to Laney's room and opened the door slowly, poised to dart back should the child leap at me. Although it hadn't yet expressed any particular violence, outside its outbursts on contact, I well suspected an unprovoked attack would soon come.\r\n\r\nAs daylight scythed through the doorway I saw that, while the bed was empty, Laney’s quilts had been pulled down between the headboard and the wall into a sort of nest.\r\n\r\nThe blankets stirred, and a tiny spindle-fingered hand emerged, parting the blankets to reveal a pale eye, squinting at the light. There was only the barest recognition there, as of the pet of an acquaintance that has encountered you once or twice, and briefly at that.\r\n\r\nI felt suddenly a foreigner in my own home, alienated by the invader.\r\n\r\nI got the child dressed in Laney's clothes as quickly as I was able and dropped it at the school gates, half-hoping that it would take off into the street and become lost indefinitely, unshackling me from its burden. Clinging to that dream, I drove off, glancing back over my shoulder to see the ugly little stick figure with its naked eyes, standing apart from the other students, insidious and strange.\r\n\r\nFor the first time I was glad of my doldrums office job, numbing my sadness and the lingering dread of the cuckoo child I'd been saddled with through work. I would gladly have chained myself to my laptop for reprieve, so rapidly had all sense and perspective left me in my turmoil. How comforting the beetle drone of the machine was to me, then, the aseptic screen, and its endless figures, and their utter absence of meaning.\r\n\r\nA telephone call came, striking me from this drab comfort like a sudden fall in a dream.\r\n\r\nWho was it to be? Miss Paxton? My ex husband, poised to gloat?\r\n\r\n\"Mrs Cameron?\" a voice asked—youthful, wavering—as I hesitantly picked up the receiver. \r\n\r\n\"It's Ms,\" I said, blandly. \"Who is this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me; my name is Melanie Hale. I'm a volunteer at the National Park— Dianne passed on your contact details. I was the one that brought your daughter in yesterday. Are you free to talk? Dianne thought you might want to clear up some details with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dianne,\" I repeated, suddenly alert. \"Becker. Yes, I remember her. She was pretty dismissive of my concerns, to be honest.\"\r\n\r\nI heard the younger woman swallow uncomfortably.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry about that. She just has a different way of dealing with the public. I think she appreciated your situation, but— well. It's tricky.\"\r\n\r\nUnimpressed by her rambling, I said, \"In what way? Miss Hale— Melanie? I'm certain you've given me the wrong child, and I don't have a scrap of proof. If there's anything you can tell me that would help me, I'd be grateful.\"\r\n\r\nThere was another awkward pause before the volunteer answered.\r\n\r\n\"It's difficult to explain without an intimate knowledge of the park. I've been here three years and still it— surprises me. I found your daughter in a meadow by our biggest lake. You probably heard she'd fallen down an animal burrow of some kind.\"\r\n\r\nHow tired I was of the same story, which I little believed.\r\n\r\n\"Well,” said Melanie. “The thing is, we don't have any animals in the park capable of digging a burrow that large, and it certainly wasn't man made. That rang some alarm bells with me, and probably with Dianne, too, but she would never bring this up with an outsider, unfortunately.\"\r\n\r\nA coldness ran across my shoulder blades like a shadow. I didn't like the halting nervousness in Melanie's voice, the sense that what I'd so long feared, without words, was forming before me.\r\n\r\n\"Is this about the disappearances in the park?\" I asked. \"I heard it was drugs, or trafficking—\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the theory the police have been coming to us with,\" said Melanie, frankly. \"And trust me, there's zero evidence of that. But I and plenty of other people have seen things here that might be explained in, uh, less straightforward ways.\"\r\n\r\nI glanced around the office, relieved that none of the other workers were paying attention.\r\n\r\n\"Such as?\" I prompted.\r\n\r\nMelanie cleared her throat; a smoker’s cough.\r\n\r\n\"This is going to sound really strange, but here it is. There are... supernatural happenings here, is the only way I can put it. Everyone has their own idea of what's going on; out in Walpurgis Town the residents are mostly old European settler families, and they brought a lot of their old myths over with them. Or contextualised what they saw with those stories, I guess.\r\n\r\n\"My Nanna used to tell me about Fae folk that lived in caves and burrows, how they were just straight up mean and hateful to people that came across them. Sometimes they'd steal their possessions, other times the people themselves. And they'd leave their own behind in their places— changelings, I think they're called. They're usually sick, in all the stories.\r\n\r\n\"Obviously I used to think it was all horse shit, but working here? Seeing the missing folk that turn up... strange? I don't know. There's something here, but I wouldn't call them fairies. Whatever it is feels older than that.\"\r\n\r\nThe phone felt slippery in my hand, as though it were a bloodied bone I held in place of metal and plastic.\r\n\r\n\"Like I said,\" Melanie stated, \"I'm really not supposed to talk about this. There's really no proof at all, so I could get in a lot of trouble for bringing it up with you. Anyway, you probably think I'm nuts.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I whispered, so quietly I doubt she heard my voice. \"I don't. Go on.\"\r\n\r\nClearly relieved, the young ranger continued with a renewed confidence.\r\n\r\n\"I had such a bad feeling when that teacher called the ranger's station yesterday. I always do when we have one of our weird cases come up. I was told your little girl had gone wandering by the lakeside, so I checked there first, then headed out across a nearby grassland area, which is also pretty well known for reports. When I saw that burrow— to be honest, I wanted to turn back. We all avoid them, usually. Leave them well alone.\r\n\r\n\"But on the off-chance a kid really had fallen down there I shone my flashlight down the hole, feeling sure as hell something bad was going to happen to me for poking around. Right away I saw a little girl looking right up at me, not saying a word, just... staring. Her eyes didn't look right to me, and she didn't talk, or yell, or anything. Just stood there like a rat when you turn the light on in the kitchen. Not used to people at all.\r\n\r\n\"I would have backed off and gotten out of there, but that teacher came running up behind me. Clearly figured from the way I was bent over I'd found something. I couldn't walk away then, obviously; nothing I could do but pull the kid out of the burrow and take her over to the ranger's station. She was acting wild, didn't know anybody she saw. I pulled Dianne to one side with my concerns, but she didn't want to know.\r\n\r\n\"'We've gotta hand her over,' she said to me. 'What do you want me to do? Throw her back? Come on.' Then my shift was over, and there was nothing I could do. I was up all night thinking about it. I don't know if I'm even doing the right thing calling you to tell you all this.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are,\" I said. \"You did.\"\r\n\r\nI hung up, and sat with my face in my hands, like a scene from a melodrama, yet feeling nothing of that passion, nothing but the sureness of what I must do.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the school day I went to pick up the child. As I'd anticipated Miss Paxton was standing with it at the gates, her mouth pressed into a line as thin and white as a chalk drawing. \r\n\r\n\"Hi,\" she said, faintly. \"Can we talk? Laney's been having some... difficulties at school today.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course she has,\" I cut in, sharply. \"And we both know why that is, don't we?\"\r\n\r\nThe teacher looked taken aback, a guilty avoidance in her eyes. \r\n\r\nI looked at the child, which seemed even less a fit in its own skin than ever, flinching and glaring at every passer-by. I gazed hard at the odd little face, the clawing hands with dirt under the nails.\r\n\r\n\"Let's go,\" I said, and the child followed, if only in that it knew, in some base manner, that I was its caretaker here, above earth.\r\n\r\nI drove out to the National Park without even stopping at home first, having already been by to pick up a change of clothes and a spade, which I had packed in a canvas bag in order to be less conspicuous.\r\n\r\nThe sun was a low, yellow-red stain against the sky, looking like blood in egg yolk as I tumbled the child out of the car and ushered it out onto the trail. The light imprinted itself on the edges of my vision as we walked, turning all I saw that same shade.\r\n\r\nI had a map of the park with me, which was easy enough to follow. Laney's class hadn’t ventured particularly far out, only a couple of hours along one well-used path. Whether or not the child knew then where I was taking it I don't know; it stumbled at the end of my arm with the same fussing displeasure with which it seemed to regard all things.\r\n\r\nThe lake came into view, and the mountain range beyond it. To the right lay a stretch of grass so flat it was like absinthe spilled across a desktop, intimidating in the vastness of its planes. This was where the ranger, Melanie, had found the child dressed in my daughter's clothes; this was where the burrow dwellers lived, the old mischiefs of Walpurgis legend. \r\n\r\nI should have laughed to find myself believing in such myths without question, but I had seen this creature devour dirt and stones, could feel, now, with a firm conviction, the watchful, humming presence of something underfoot, far, far down.\r\n\r\nHeading out there I hadn't expected to come across a burrow; the chance of doing so in such grand terrain was inconceivable. Yet the park seemed full of such unlikely details, for after a further twenty minute excursion I nearly found myself tumbling down into a pit much like that which Melanie had described.\r\n\r\nI stood at the mouth of it, feeling, as I peered down, the same crushing numbness that had gripped me since the telephone call in the office. Grief, grief without hope of an end was that draining absence, and yet it was through that very hope that I was there.\r\n\r\n\"Look,\" I said, to the child. \"That's where you came from. I want you to go back down there and give me my daughter.\"\r\n\r\nI don't know why I thought it would understand me. Its white-blue eyes were lifeless but for the captured flare of the sun, its mouth slack, speechless. The young ranger had said the burrower dwellers left their sick in place of the people they took; this creature was surely one of them, insensible to anything that was said to it.\r\n\r\nThat, or like any animal it only heard my voice as a series of meaningless sounds.\r\n\r\nEither way, it could not respond to me, could not give me what I asked for. \r\n\r\nI looked at the stranger for a long moment, glancing over my shoulder and all about us, seeing no one else in view at this odd hour. Then, with a quick motion I couldn't take back, I stepped up behind the child and shoved it down into the burrow with both hands, glad that its scrabbling attempts to clamber back up the crumbling sides only pulled grass and dirt down on top of it. \r\n\r\nI heard it moving at the bottom of the pit, scratching with its fingernails, and took the spade out of my bag. If the child made any headway up the sloping side of the burrow I would push it back down, I decided, repeating the act as often as I had to until the ones that had sent it above-ground returned my Laney to me. Surely they had her, still, I told myself, had kept her like a pet in their warrens, a thievery that might be reversed.\r\n\r\nYet as I sat on the grass by the burrow, waiting, waiting, I began to consider, with all the imaginative plenty of dread, the possibility that something more terrible than merely being taken might have befallen my daughter. \r\n\r\nAs night fell, and the cold, and the dark, and the silence provoked me, I at last began to wonder if the young ranger and I had been mistaken.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the little girl I had thrown down into the hole in the earth had been my daughter, after all.",

        "text": "It all started with a snake.\n\nFar too early in the morning, Verona Halčínova, aged mother of the mayor, was making her climb up the hillside cemetery to the church. Since her son was the head of the village and held considerable sway over life between the forests, Verona thought it boorish for her to not be prominent in the community as well. With the priest being — to put it lightly — an odd fellow, Verona decided she would serve as the village’s head of faith. Her self-decreed title required Verona to not only attend every mass of the week, but to also show up half an hour before the priest arrived to shame him into some semblance of sobriety.\n\nSo, every morning, far too early in the morning; Verona would don a fresh kerchief, grab her cane and climb up the steep hill on which the village’s little chapel stood. It’s on one of these early morning climbs, with not a soul around aside from the pious Verona, that it all started.\n\nAnd it all started with a snake falling from the sky.\n\nAs an outsider I wasn’t privy to village gossip. I only found out about the snake until Sunday morning. Brother Donát was stumbling his way through end-of-mass announcements when Verona stood up and interrupted.\n\nFor four days she had sat in the pews and listened to the preacher avoid the unavoidable, the old woman screeched. There had been an omen, a snake had fallen from the sky. A cobra straight from the lands of Egypt. The Lord had sent a serpent as a warning and that warning was going unheeded.\n\nSome in the church murmured in approval, some hissed at the interruption and Brother Donát didn’t do much at all. He simply said something about the Lord working in mysterious ways and how we all must look into our hearts to see if we are at fault. After a brief sneeze Donát continued with end-of-mass announcements.\n\nVerona, once again, interrupted the priest with more shrieking but this time there was considerable resistance. The priest was announcing the funeral mass of a villager that was, even in death, more beloved than Verona.\n\nSensing the shifting tempers in the creaky chapel, Mayor Halčín stood up and announced that a meeting regarding the snakes would be held in the town hall after the priest would bless his parish goodbye. Aside from another sneeze from Brother Donát, no objections to the change of venue were raised.\n\nThe ‘town hall’ of the village was actually a decommissioned Bolshevik-era fire station that was solely used for funeral receptions and elections. It made for a poor town hall location. The space was never intended to hold a crowd, let alone an agitated one at that. The walk down from the chapel had let theories start to fester and by the time the villagers crowded into the cement box accusations started flying around.\n\nThe main hall had little standing room or air and the flickering of the fluorescent lightbulbs agitate the crowd further. Everyone had a theory for what unchristian behavior might have brought on God’s wrath and everyone had decided to voice their varying theories in unison. It wasn’t until Halčín had asserted his authority with shouting that the crowd settled down.\n\nWith the same composure he handled every crisis, the mayor asked if anyone had an explanation for the falling snake which did not involve the Lord’s anger. Only one man spoke up — the village veterinarian; he said that the snake might have fallen from a bird’s beak. Perhaps a stork or an eagle had made a nest nearby and had simply dropped its prey by accident.\n\nThe veterinarian’s theory was not well received.\n\nBy the time differing theories, theories which revolved around unchristian neighbors, started to emerge Halčín once again silenced the crowd. If the topic of the mysterious snake was to be discussed through a theological lens, then it should be done by a priest, the mayor decreed.\n\nBrother Donát, however, was nowhere to be found. When someone announced that the priest’s car was gone, much of the room emptied out to verify. With a taste of fresh valley air the crowd calmed down. Accusations were still being thrown around but the villagers agreed to postpone the discussion until next mass.\n\nOn my walk back to the cottage I saw no eagles or storks. Then again, I wasn’t exactly searching for birds.\n\nOriginally, I only attended Sunday mass to stay in the good graces of the village. Back in the city I wasn’t a religious person and I definitely wasn’t a catholic. When one lives between the forests though, it becomes difficult to not grasp for some level of supernatural safety. Up in that rickety steeple on the hill I wasn’t making peace with Jesus Christ, I was trying to hedge my bets with the forest beyond.\n\nThat Sunday night there was a storm. It was the sort of storm that makes you fear God. The rain came down heavy and thick just before sunset and there was barely a moment without thunder. Having done most of the repairs on the roof myself I was doubly scared of the howling wind tearing the cottage apart and, with the prospect of a thunderstrike frying my computer, I wasn’t able to distract myself with any work. I spent that Sunday night lying in bed draped in terror.\n\nIt was well after the storm and I was only half-awake when I first heard it. It broke through the steady pitter patter of tin roof rain like a brick through glass. An unearthly roar descended from the sky. The dark growl dragged itself through the valley for what felt like minutes but there was no lightning anywhere on the horizon. The sound had stirred me out of my sleep enough to look outside, but when the darkness provided no answers and the skies descended into silence once more, I went back to sleep.\n\nJust like the mystery of the falling snake, I decided to ignore the strange thunder.\n\nPerhaps because I needed something to distract myself, I spent most of the following day behind the computer. I moved out to the village to be closer to nature and further away from the trappings of modern life, but I work as a freelance graphic designer so there’s certain things that are inescapable. With a hefty day of screen time behind me and a certain curiosity about how morning mass went I made my way to the village pub.\n\nAs it turned out, Brother Donát’s spiritual guidance did not satisfy his parish. Nothing of consequence was said and the priest refused to pick a side on whether the snake was of godly or earthly origin. The steeple of the church was examined from below, but when the prospect of checking the top of the flimsy structure was floated no one volunteered. The question of the graveyard snake was starting to lose its novelty and it almost lost it completely if it wasn’t for one of the farmhands.\n\nThe boy had managed to spot not one, but two snakes warming themselves on a grave in the afternoon sun. Not knowing what else to do the farmhand dashed down the hill and roused whatever soul he could out of the nearby cottages. A few of the curious crowd had witnessed the snakes before they scampered off but the moment the sighting turned into news the facts started to differ.\n\nWhen I entered the pub, the air had already turned thick with tobacco and debate.\n\nNone of those who had witnessed the snakes were present in the pub, yet versions of their stories were being shouted across the room. The Miller was certain that the two serpents were nothing but harmless garden snakes. The Carpenter, on the other hand, swore he heard that the two snakes were cobras just like the one that Verona had witnessed. Old Štefan, who did very little of use in the village, claimed that both men were misled. The creatures spotted in the graveyard were neither garden snakes nor cobras, they were a reptile dreamed up by the devil himself. Not only that, the grave that the snakes rested on was none other but that of the woodsman.\n\nThe mention of the woodsman had quieted down the table. An uncomfortable topic to which I was not privy to squirmed itself through everyone’s eyes. The whole pub became unbearably tense until — with a slam on the table — the Mayor broke the spell.\n\n‘This is not the time to speak about the snakes. None who witnessed them are present and no conclusions can be reached without evidence,’ Halčín decreed, ‘Let us not debate around this table about who heard what. Let us do what should be done in a pub! Drink!’\n\nThen, the mayor summoned the bartender and made sure no man was left without slivovitz. Once the shot glasses were emptied the conversation shifted away from the snakes. Once the shot glasses were filled and emptied again, some of us might have even forgotten about the alleged serpents in the first place.  \n\nI arrived back at my cottage much drunker than anticipated. The slivovitz in my stomach made the stairs up to my bedroom a mighty climb and when I finally reached my bed the world was spinning far too quickly for me to fall asleep. Half-awake, I managed to crawl my way over to the bathroom and empty my stomach. Too exhausted to make the journey back to bed I took my rest by the toilet bowl.\n\nI drifted between the numb darkness of drunken dreams and the cold tile of my bathroom well after the road lights had gone out. The headache came slowly. At first, I was able to ignore the pain with sleep, yet with each new spindle of discomfort that popped behind my eyes, escape became more improbable. Suddenly I was sweaty and my heart was skipping beats. The punishment for slivovitz on an empty stomach had caught up with me.\n\nI drank as much water as my stomach could handle and laid down in my bed, yet the room refused to stop spinning. The rolling around in bed was just making me sweatier. Getting up and stumbling down the stairs brought on another wave of nausea but getting out into the mountain air settled me. In my underwear and a shirt that reeked of cigarettes I stood out in the complete darkness.\n\nThe road lights had been turned off and the night was absolute. With the exception of a silhouetted countryside and the burning moon above everything else was plunged into darkness. All that existed was the bubbling of the nearby brook. Sitting on a bench by the door, I started to breathe off my hangover.\n\nThe drunkenness had long overstayed its welcome and my brain felt like it had burst into flames, yet even past the hangover I was able to enjoy my surroundings. I remember that moment well — that tranquility that reminded me why I left the city.\n\nI remember that moment well because of how it ended.\n\nThe sound started off faint, but nonetheless concerning. Like a burst of thunder dragged past its breaking point. It undoubtedly came from the sky and it was undoubtedly getting louder. My brain squirmed with renewed pain, but I kept my eyes locked on the dark forest and the burning moon above. When my migraine had reached its zenith an imminent sense of nausea climbed up my throat. The louder the dark note in the skies got the more my condition worsened.\n\nI only saw the source of that cursed roar for a split second before I had to avert my eyes. Big and black and shining red, the machine passed above. All the water that I had drank to hold back my hangover left my throat and my body collapsed in the grass. For what felt like hours but must’ve been minutes, I lay on the floor and shivered in fear and weakness, unable to face the heavens. It wasn’t until the horrible sound was nothing but an echo that I managed to rise to my feet.\n\nThe sky was clear once more, but off in the distance, away from the moon — I could see two dim red lights disappear into the forest. The perplexing sight and sound had sobered me enough to lead me back up the stairs to my bedroom. Being covered in mud from my collapse, I elected to take a shower. Shortly after that shower I fell into an exhausted sleep.\n\nI had hoped that I would wake up and not remember the affair, or at least that by morning light I would be able to discount the whole experience as a product of drunken stupor. I did neither. Instead, I woke up well into the late afternoon feeling like a corpse with the perplexing events of the previous night burning in the back of my skull right next to the headache.\n\nFor hours I lay in bed, questioning my sanity. When no comforting answers presented themselves, I climbed out of bed, pulled on some fresh clothes and made my way to the pub. I had hoped that someone else had heard the terrible sound, that there would be some simple rural explanation to the phenomena that my upbringing in the city had simply robbed me of — yet in the pub I found no answers.\n\nInstead, I found chaos. \n\nThe pub was much angrier than before. Different stories of snake sightings had spread through the village and were getting aired out in the smokey room. The Veterinarian, who rarely visited the pub, stood in opposition to the rumors with a few sober voices of support. He had seen the stork nesting at the top of the steeple. Others had too. The sightings of exotic serpents, the Veterinarian claimed, were fabulations brought on by religious panic.\n\nThe bartender — as always — was the calmest person in the room and made no fuss about me getting a Kofola. When I tried to ask him about the strange roar in the middle of the night, however, he nodded his head towards the lively debate about the snakes. He was not interested in conversation; he was enjoying the show.\n\nHalčín, befitting a mayor, sat at the center of the rowdy table. When I had first entered the pub, he was trying to calm the atmosphere with jokes and laughter, but by the time I sat down his appetite for diplomacy had passed.\n\nHis slam on the table sent a glass of wine and one of the ashtrays crashing to the ground. In no uncertain terms, Halčín declared that all discussion of snakes was to cease at once. On the following morning a ladder was to be brought to the church and the steeple was to be inspected for nests. Any further discussion of the serpents until then was not suited for polite company.\n\nThe sound of broken glass quieted the crowd and the bulging veins on Halčín’s forehead prolonged the silence. On any other occasion I would have stayed silent as well, knowing that I am still an outsider in the village community, yet, driven by fear I spoke up.\n\nI asked the table if anyone had heard the horrible howl last night. \n\nMy question was answered with nothing but stares that bounced between me and Halčín. Over the months I had been welcome into the village community as an outsider, yet asking the question about the mysterious night-sound had been a bridge too far.\n\nI tried to explain myself further, to mention the red lights and the dark shape that moved across the sky — yet I scarcely got a sentence out before Halčín silenced me.\n\nNo one else had heard the sound, he said. I was simply spreading further panic.\n\nAs divided as the rest of the table was about the snakes, they were united on the issue of me speaking. This was no time for outsiders. I was not welcome among the village people anymore. With the pub silent and tense, I finished off my pint of Kofola and excused myself from all social activities.\n\nI did not plan to stay awake that night. All I wanted to do was become unconscious as soon as possible and wake up to a world that I would understand better. The thought of that terrible sound, however, of that indescribable black machine, of those two burning red lights — it kept me sleepless well into darkness.\n\nIt was around two in the morning when I heard it again. The dark groan started softly enough that I thought it a product of my imagination, yet when my windows started to shake under the strain of that unearthly sound, I knew that what had haunted me the night prior had returned.\n\nPerhaps, I was driven purely by exhaustion and confusion. Perhaps, what got me out of bed was a morbid sense of curiosity. Either way, I made my way down the creaky stairs and out into the darkness.\n\nMy stomach and head had recovered somewhat from the slivovitz, yet the metallic bedlam above brought on the same discomfort that had plagued me the night prior. The roar was louder this time, much louder. The sound of the calm bubbling stream had been utterly annihilated by the sky. All that existed was the burning moon, the silhouette of the forest and that terrible roar.\n\nI watched the sky, every fiber of my being wanted me to turn around and hide in my cottage — yet with tears in my eyes I faced the sky demanding answers to the origins of that cursed roar.\n\nI saw the machine for but a moment but that moment will forever be etched into memory. Set against the backdrop of the bright yellow moon, its wings massive and shining red — I saw what looked like a massive cargo plane.\n\nIt flew much lower than it did the night prior and its roar was loud enough to feel in the teeth. My knees buckled and my heartbeat throbbed in my eardrums. As the massive black airbus passed above all I could do was whimper in the mud.\n\nI could not see the machine, but every inch of my body felt it. The plane flew much lower than any plane should. When the giant was right above me and my terror had reached its zenith, I found myself screaming. Yet no sound left my mouth. The roar of the metal monster had completely ensnared the world.\n\nWhen the sound finally started to fade, I thought myself deaf for a moment. It’s not until the gentle bubbling of the nearby stream edged itself into reality that I finally found myself safe.\n\nThe mere sight of the machine made me doubt my sanity. I did not look back at the plane’s glowing wings. Instead, I looked out at the village. The road lights were long dead, but the windows of the cottages were lighting up one by one. I stood out in the mud, listening for any hint of conversation, for some sort of clue to what had just happened — yet the villagers stayed in their homes and kept their conversations contained there as well.\n\nSoon enough the moon became swallowed up in clouds that leaked lightning. With the first burst of thunder — real thunder — the lights in the cottages started to turn dar. By the time the first drop of rain left the sky I made my way back to my home as well.\n\nI was still terrified. I was nearly going mad trying to understand what had just transpired. There was, however, some solace in the idea that others had heard that terrible roar as well. I would not be alone in my terror. Maybe, I tried to convince myself, someone from the village might have a perfectly reasonable explanation for the strange plane. For a while that misguided ember of hope kept me company, but by the time I had laid down in bed it was snuffed out.\n\nThere was no reasonable explanation.\n\nThe airbus wholly defied reason. I found myself sick to my stomach even trying to visualize it. The machine was — at first glance — just a particularly large airplane. Yet the more I replayed those few fevered seconds of its visage the more I became sure it was a thing of the eldritch. It moved far too slow for an object that flies. The machine’s roar was unlike that of any airport. There was no conceivable reason for why the airbus would fly so low.\n\nThe inexplicable nature of what I had witnessed kept me from sleep for hours, yet as the rain died down to nothing but taps on a tin roof, I found myself counting sheep. I never fell asleep that night — or at least I don’t think I did. I did, however, find some solace in those dark tranquil hours. I found solace in the idea that I would get answers soon, that once the whole village had gathered and acknowledged the terrible plane that my fears would be quelled.\n\nI couldn’t have been more wrong.\n\nLong before the rooster crowed, I found myself on my feet. I wasn’t planning to head to the church yet, it was barely light outside — yet when I looked out of the window, I could already see people making their way up the road. Everyone had umbrellas out but no one was dressed in their church clothes. The villagers weren’t going to the church to pray. They were going to the church to get answers.\n\nThe rain had picked up into cold wet chunks, but no one was dissuaded. On top of the hill, surrounding the church; an agitated crowd gathered. Among the villagers murmurs about the *strange thunder from last night* were starting to spread. Whenever the discussion of the unearthly sound got too loud, however, mayor Halčín would quiet down the discussion.\n\nOne crisis at a time, he said. The issue of the *strange thunder* would be discussed once the stork nest was retrieved.\n\nThe church had been standing for well over a hundred years and, at its top, it once held a bell. During the war the Nazis reappropriated the bell to be smelted down into munitions and the Bolsheviks were in no rush to replace it. Without a bell the stairs to the steeple aged without repair until they became a death-trap.\n\nIt wasn’t until the two farmhands carried in the lengthy ladder that conversation shifted away from the snakes and *strange thunder*. In quiet whispers, far too quiet for the third farmhand to hear, the gathered crowd of villagers wondered whether the church steeple would be safe to ascend.\n\nPerhaps because he didn’t hear the concerns, or perhaps in a false show of bravado; the third farmhand climbed up the ladder without complaint or pause. It wasn’t until he was halfway up the rickety structure that his steps lost their confidence. A gust of wind ruffled many of the umbrellas below. The church steeple creaked, ever so gently. The farmhand became aware of the height he had climbed to and stopped. For a moment it looked as if he would descend.\n\nThe farmhand’s mind was quickly changed by his colleagues holding the ladder. Past the rain they swayed between encouraging shouts and questions about his masculinity. The farmhand put on another burst of speed and leaped up the ladder to the top of the steeple.\n\nThe storm drowned out what the farmhand was yelling, but he was clearly reaching out for something. Whatever he was trying to grab, however, escaped his grasp.\n\nOne moment the farmhand was reaching inside of the steeple — the next he was grasping at air. With another groan from the steeple the ladder lost its balance and tipped towards the iron fence of the churchyard.\n\nA horrible scream that refused to die stretched through the valley like a high-pitched air raid siren. As he rushed down the hill to help the poor youth, the Veterinarian called out for someone to call an ambulance. I managed to avert my eyes from the dying farmhand but I couldn’t shut out my ears to his horrid screams.\n\nAmong those screams, I could hear calls for a priest. The boy wasn’t going to make it. The boy wasn’t going to make it and Brother Donát was nowhere to be found. In the absence of a priest, mayor Halčín descended down the hill to comfort the dying youth.\n\nFor a moment the crowd of villagers on the hill stood in complete silence with nothing but death rattles and rain to keep them company. Then, seizing the opportunity for spiritual support; Verona Halčínová climbed up the church steps and started to preach.\n\nThe snakes, the *strange thunder*, the accident; it was all a sign, she said. The Lord had seen into the homes of the village and found them wanting of faith. Calamities would keep on happening until each and every member of the village had atoned for their sins and accepted the truth of God into their heart.\n\nAs she raved, the old woman kept on looking at me; as if I was the source of all the *signs*. Perhaps I reacted to her singling me out, or maybe it was because I was so starved for answers that I couldn’t stay quiet — but I spoke out.\n\nI told the Mayor’s mother that she was wrong. That the sounds in the night weren’t strange thunder, but an airplane. The village was not being punished for some abstract crime of the spirit — there was simply a giant black airbus flying dangerously low through the valley at night.\n\nEven as the farmhand expired within ear shot, my explanation for the *strange thunder* produced some laughs. Most of the crowd, however, became angry. \n\nI was speaking out of line and, furthermore, I was speaking nonsense.\n\nEnergized by the crowd Verona launched into another religious diatribe this time directed specifically at me. I had come from the city and I belonged back in the city. It was only with my arrival a couple months prior that strange things started to happen in the village. It sounded as if Verona was about to list off these *strange things* but her preaching was cut short by a barrage of hail.\n\nWithin seconds the shards of ice went from peas to pebbles to fists. Much of the congregation quickly retreated into the church but I ran down the hill towards the exit from the churchyard. As I passed the crowd that had gathered around the farmhand, they paid me no mind. They were too busy shielding the fresh corpse with umbrellas.\n\nThe storm that washed over the village was unlike anything I had witnessed before. I arrived back at my cottage wet and shivering and bruised. Not for a moment did the barrage of hail relent. None of it broke the skin, yet minutes after I found shelter beneath my tin roof dark purple bruises of impact spread up my arms and back.\n\nThe cabin had sheltered me from many storms over the months but this tempest seemed to be of a wholly different nature. The whole wooden structure vibrated under the relentless barrage of hail and wind. The calm stream in front of the cabin strengthened into a wild river of mud and my whole yard was swallowed up with shards of ice. The mood felt decidedly apocalyptic and I had no idea what to do.\n\nStanding anywhere near the windows felt hazardous and no part of the creaky cabin felt particularly stable. Not knowing what else to do I curled up beneath the winding staircase that led to the second floor of the cottage. It felt like the most stable part of the house and the noise was the most bearable in that dusty corner.\n\nFor a while I just shivered, my mind blank with terror. Then, even though the pandemonium outside stayed the same — my breaths slowed. Past the sheer confusion from the storm, past the questions about that horrid airbus —\n\nI found myself counting sheep.\n\nWhen I woke, I woke to complete darkness. Hunger and thirst quickly followed. Every muscle in my body roared with bruises but after some groans and false starts I managed to get up and locate the fridge. I found a Tupperware container with overcooked pasta. I was so groggy and hungry that I ate straight from the container. After the cold meal was done, I chased it with my last can of coke.\n\nThe storm had passed and only the hiss of the muddy river remained. With my immediate needs met, I found myself in a sense of dazed calm.  Soon enough, however, my mind drifted back to the plane and its terrible roar.\n\nMy phone read fifteen minutes to two AM.\n\nWhen I pulled my aching body up the staircase, I told myself that I would just take a shower, change into dry clothes and lie down in bed. I told myself that I would wake up wiser, but deep inside I knew I wasn’t going to sleep.\n\nI did not shower. I simply put on dry clothes and made my way back down the stairs.\n\nOutside the sky had turned cloudless and the moon shined just as bright as it did before. The stream, however, had grown wild. The water leaped up much higher than it ever had before and would occasionally splash into my front yard. All that divided me from the raging torrents below was a bridge that was rickety on the best of days.\n\nMy flashlight shook as I crossed the rotting wood, yet I did not let myself think about the possibility of a collapse. I had more important things to worry about.\n\nI had the airbus to consider.\n\nPerhaps if I raised my concerns with the Veterinarian or even Mayor Halčín, they would be heard. The rest of the village, however, wouldn’t believe anything without concrete evidence. The mere existence of the plane bothered me to no end, but I knew that if I was to get help in solving its mystery I would need proof. So, with a flashlight in one hand and a phone in the other, I made my way up the village road.\n\nIt was one minute from the hour when I reached the churchyard. The spot of fence where the farmhand had landed in the morning was covered in a burlap sack. I did my best to force any question of its contents out of my mind. Thoughts of the boy’s body still being impaled on those metal spikes quickly became replaced with fevered questions about the flying machine.\n\nI kept my phone trained on the moon.\n\nEvery neuron of my attention was focused on picking up any hint of that terrible sound, of seeing even the slightest shiver in the trees that would suggest the arrival of that horrible plane — yet no precursors to horror manifested. All I could hear was the hush of the muddied river and, when the silhouettes of trees did sway, it was from a gentle forest breeze.\n\nI found myself wondering whether the plane was just a product of my imagination, whether I had simply gone mad out in the countryside. My worry for my sanity only lasted for a moment. There was a pile of manure further up the road, but the wind from the woods had brought in the undeniable smell of forest. The hush of the wild stream went from a source of concern to a source of tranquility.\n\nThe village was nothing but a little bastion of civilization in a valley of the incomprehensible. I was nothing but a little man trying to find reason in the face of nature. The plane was nothing but a figment of my imagination, I convinced myself. Spending months away from the comforts of city life had just driven me a little bit mad.\n\nIt was time for me to go back home and sleep in a bed.\n\nI scarcely made three steps when I heard it though. I had started to believe that visions of the airbus were nothing but me going crazy in the woods, but the moment I heard the start of the rumble I let go of those lies.\n\nThe plane was real. The plane was real and it was approaching the village.\n\nThe moment the machine emerged from the woods I averted my eyes. It was much closer. It was much louder. The sight of its terrible silhouette was enough to make me hold down vomit and grit my teeth. Through my distress I still managed to raise my shaking hand to the sky. As the phone captured the plane bathed in moonlight it grew unbearably hot but I kept my grip strong.\n\nThe airbus flew much, much lower than it did before. Its roar annihilated all other sounds from the universe, but past my panic I could see the other cottage windows light up. I wasn’t the only one who was witness to the terrible machine, but not being alone in my horror did nothing to ease my anguish.\n\nFor a mere moment I thought I heard a sound of wood cracking, of something falling on the side of the church hill — yet the deafening sound of the dark plane’s engine quickly rendered my surroundings irrelevant. As the airbus passed over me it felt as if my eyeballs were about to vibrate out of their sockets.\n\nIt wasn’t until the plane’s roar started to subside that I noticed the flames. Half of the spire had been knocked to the ground below and what was left of the church was on fire. The remnants of the spire were ablaze as well, yet the water-soaked earth had kept their light dim. The only bright fire on the ground was that of the burlap sack stretched across the iron fence.\n\nMy hopes of recording the dark machine had proved futile. When the villagers spilled from their homes out onto the road my phone was hot and dark and refused to turn on. \n\nI had no evidence of the plane knocking down the church’s steeple.\n\nThe blaze at the top of the churchyard hill attracted immediate attention, yet as the villagers armed with buckets of water sobered from their sleep the futility of their fight became apparent. It would take at least half an hour for a firetruck to arrive.\n\nNo amount of buckets could stop the blaze atop of the hill.\n\nI tried explaining to the gathered mob that I had seen the plane, that I had witnessed the crash and had no doubts about what had caused it. My testimony, however, soon became just another theory.\n\nEven though the storm had long passed, some considered the crash a freak lightning strike. Other — much more fanatical voices — considered the collapsed steeple and blaze another sign that the Lord had been displeased with the village. When I told them that they were wrong, when I told them that I had witnessed the airplane with my own eyes — the crowd turned aggressive.\n\nI fled the churchyard and, once the roads became visible, I fled the village. There was no reasoning with the locals and I fear that if I stayed there any longer more of them would start to consider me the source of their misfortune.\n\nI write this as I sit on a high-speed train to the city. I do not know where I will sleep tonight, but I take solace in the idea that I will not be anywhere near that incomprehensible machine. I worry about what will happen to the village tonight. I worry that the plane will fly lower once more and cause unspeakable suffering.\n\nYet, as the train whizzes through the countryside that turns into small towns that turns into cities, I find my mind calming. I am safe. I content myself on the idea that I am safe from that terrible plane.\n\nAs the stations through which the train passes become familiar, however, I can’t let go of a single sight.\n\nWhen the steeple first fell, as the villagers dashed up and down the hill with rusty buckets of water — I saw something. Out among the kindling that was once the top of the steeple, with burning straw for company and its white feathers caked in mud and blood — I saw a dead stork.\n\nIt had a garden snake in its [mouth](https://www.reddit.com/r/MJLPresents/comments/11k3ds4/morana_air/).",

        "text": "For a decade, I have been a cleaner for crime scenes, and nothing seemed to faze me anymore. But little did I know that fate had different plans for me. \n\nA call came in, and I was summoned to an apartment. The police had left with their verdict - it was an accident. \n\nMainly because they could not find a body.\n\nBut as I got closer to the apartment, I felt an eerie presence around me. My gut told me that something was off, and it was not just a mere accident.\n\nMy suspicions were confirmed when I saw the place - it was a disaster. The air was thick with the stench of ozone and burnt flesh. The furniture was overturned, and the roof was scorched and blackened as if they had been subjected to a massive surge of electricity.\n\nA lamp lay shattered on the floor, its bulb flickering like a dying ember.\n\nThe walls were covered in half-dried blood splatter, but as I looked closer, I could see that the walls also had strange symbols and markings, etched into the plaster with what looked like sharp claws.\n\nIt was like something out of a nightmare, a twisted and surreal landscape that defied all reason and logic. I felt a shiver run down my spine as I realized that I was in the midst of something far beyond my understanding or control. The windows were sealed with black trash bags.\n\nWhen I looked around the room my eyes fell on the desk in the corner with amateur radio, some old books, and a notepad lying on it.\n\nI had to investigate further, and started by reading the notepad, I wish I hadn’t.\n\nThe notes were some form of a diary. It was very detailed and told as if it were a story. It was about a young man in his mid-twenties, living in a quiet suburb of a small town. The very town I was now in. \n\nHe was a bit of a loner, preferring to spend his time tinkering with electronics and experimenting with anything he could find.\n\nHe had always been fascinated by the way that different devices could be used to connect people across great distances, and he was constantly looking for new and innovative ways to explore this fascination.\n\nHis name was Jack.\n\nOn this particular day, Jack was strolling through his neighborhood, enjoying the warm summer sun and the gentle breeze. He had recently moved into the area and was still getting used to the layout of the streets and the quirks of his new neighbors. He liked to take long walks around the area, exploring the hidden corners and forgotten alleys that most people overlooked.\n\nAs he wandered down a quiet side street, he spotted a sign advertising a yard sale. Intrigued, he made his way over to the yard and began to browse the items on display.\n\nHe noticed that several of the items seemed to be from the Soviet era. There were old, battered cameras, some of which still had Cyrillic letters on them. There were also a few dusty books, with titles that Jack didn't recognize.\n\nBut Jack was drawn to a dusty old radio, sitting on a table in the corner. It looked like it had been sitting in someone's attic for years, but Jack was immediately drawn to it.\n\nHe picked it up and examined it closely, turning it over in his hands and testing the knobs and dials. He could tell that it was an older model, but it seemed to be in decent condition. Without really thinking about it, he decided to buy the radio, hoping that he could bring it back to life and use it to explore his passion for communication and electronics.\n\nAs Jack approached the person holding the yard sale to purchase the radio, he couldn't help but notice that the seller seemed a bit hesitant to part with it. The seller, an elderly man with a stern expression, seemed to be studying Jack carefully as he handed over the cash.\n\n\"Are you sure you want this?\" the seller asked, his voice low and serious.\n\nJack nodded, a bit confused by the question. \"Yeah, I think it's really cool. I've been looking for something like this for a while now.\"\n\nThe seller shook his head slowly. \"This radio has a history, you know. It's not like the others. It's been through some things that most people wouldn't believe.\"\n\nJack's interest was piqued. \"What do you mean? What kind of things?\"\n\nThe seller sighed heavily, seeming to weigh his words carefully. \"Let's just say that it's seen some dark times. It is from a time that I just want to forget about.\"\n\nThe seller looked at him for a long moment, then shook his head. \"I can't say any more. You'll have to find out for yourself. But be careful, son.”\n\nWith those cryptic words, the seller handed the radio over to Jack and quickly packed up his other items. Jack was left standing there, holding the radio and feeling a sense of unease creeping over him. “Why all this hassle over a simple radio?” Jack thought to himself.\n\nJack convinced himself it was just an old man's memories haunting him and went home with his new project.\n\nI had to stop reading from the notepad for a bit, scanning the room and laying eyes on the radio on the table. “That must be the radio he bought.” I thought to myself. \n\nI continued reading.\n\nAfter getting home, Jack took the radio apart and cleaned it. He replaced the broken antenna and turned it on. To his surprise, the radio worked fine, and he was soon able to pick up all sorts of signals, from local news to amateur radio chatter. Jack loved the thrill of communicating with strangers from faraway places, and he soon became addicted to his new radio.\n\nOne night, while tuning his radio, Jack heard something odd. He was immediately struck by the unusual nature of the signal he was picking up. It was faint and garbled, with a strange rhythm and pitch that seemed to fluctuate at random. It was unlike anything he had ever heard before. A rhythmic tapping och pecking mixed with something close to mumbling came through the speakers of the radio.\n\nAt first, Jack thought that it might just be interference from another nearby radio station or some other electronic device. But as he adjusted the knobs and dials, he realized that the signal was something else entirely. It was almost like a language, but one that he couldn't quite decipher. There were strange pops and clicks interspersed with long, drawn-out tones that seemed to stretch on forever.\n\nDespite its strange nature, Jack found himself becoming more and more entranced by the signal. He couldn't explain it, but he felt like there was something important hidden within the garbled noise, something that he was meant to discover.\n\nHe recorded the signal and played it back over and over again, trying to discern any patterns or clues hidden within. But the more he listened, the more confused and disoriented he became. It was like the signal was actively working against him, trying to keep him from understanding its true meaning.\n\nHe tried to tune in, but the signal was too weak, and it faded away after a few minutes.\n\nThis is when Jack started to use the notepad more as a diary and sort of log book. I read the next entry.\n\n23-01-12: Jack visited a nearby amateur radio club and asked the members if they had ever heard anything like the strange signal he had picked up. They told him it was probably just interference from nearby electronic devices, but Jack wasn't convinced. He went back home and did some research, determined to find out what he had heard.\n\nAfter several hours of searching, Jack found some information about a mysterious Soviet radar station called the Duga-3. The radar was built in the 1970s as part of a Cold War missile defense system, and it was known for its massive size and strange,[ repetitive clicking sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Woodpecker.ogg). The radar was also infamous for causing interference in radio signals around the world, earning it the nickname [\"The Russian Woodpecker.\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duga_radar)\n\nJack was intrigued, but he was also very confused. The Duga-3 could not have been the source of the signal. Jack had seen images of the Duga towers and knew they were old, rusty, and almost fallen apart. The electricity to the radar station originally came from Chernobyl, so it shouldn’t have any power either.\n\nHowever, the next night, logged as 23-01-13, Jack heard the strange signal again, and this time it was much clearer. He listened carefully and heard a faint voice, speaking in a foreign language. The voice was muffled, but Jack could make out a few words that sounded like they might be Russian.\n\nJack was excited but also scared. He had stumbled upon something strange and mysterious, and he didn't know what to do. He continued to listen to the radio, and he heard more strange signals and creepy voices.\n\nDays turned into weeks, and there were many dates and notes about the signals. What I could understand is that Jack became more and more obsessed with the strange signals. He started to stay up all night, listening to the radio and taking notes. He even started to hear the signals during the day from regular speakers, when he was at work, in the car, or out running errands.\n\n23-02-02: Jack decided to upload the recordings to an online forum for amateur radio enthusiasts, hoping to get some feedback. To his surprise, no one had heard any of the signals he uploaded. Jack was perplexed. He had spent countless hours analyzing and decoding the strange signals he had picked up on his radio. But now, it seemed like no one else was able to pick up on the signals he had heard for weeks.\n\nJack tried to stay calm and rational, reminding himself that the signals might have been simply too weak or too distorted for other listeners to pick up on. But as the days went on and he received no feedback from the online community, his sense of unease and isolation grew.\n\nHe began to spend more and more time holed up in his apartment, obsessively listening to the recordings and trying to decipher their meaning. He started to notice that the signals were becoming clearer and more distinct, almost as if they were evolving or adapting to his presence.\n\nIt was as if the signals were alive, and were somehow aware of his fascination and obsession with them.\n\nJack was thrilled but also scared. He had stumbled upon something big, something that could be dangerous. He continued to listen to the radio and record the signals, hoping to learn more. But the more he listened, the more he realized that he might be in over his head.\n\nThe thrilling feeling abruptly stopped one night, logged 23-02-14, as Jack was listening to the radio. \n\nHe heard a voice that he recognized. His heart dropped and the hairs on the back of his neck stood up, and he felt a chill run down his spine.\n\nIt was his own voice.\n\nBut distorted and warped, like it was being played backward.\n\nThe voice grew louder and more intense, and Jack felt like he was losing his mind. The lights in his apartment started to flicker. Jack started screaming to make it stop.\n\nThen, just as suddenly as it had started, the voice faded away. Jack was left trembling and sweating, unsure of what had just happened.\n\nOver the next few days, strange things started to happen around Jack's house. Objects would move on their own, and he would hear whispers and footsteps when no one else was around. His dreams were plagued by strange Cyrillic symbols and twisted creatures, and he woke up feeling like he hadn't slept at all. He felt as if something was watching him from outside his windows, so he cut open and put up black trash bags over the windows so no one could see inside.\n\n23-02-19: The strange happenings only got worse. \n\nIn the evening, as he was recording the strange signals, the room filled with an icy cold breeze. The hair on his arms stood up, and he felt like he was being watched. Suddenly, the radio crackled to life, and a voice spoke in a language he didn't recognize. It was deep and gravelly like it belonged to a demon.\n\nJack tried to turn off the radio, but it didn’t stop even though the radio was turned off. The voice grew louder and more intense, and he felt like it was trying to enter his mind. He closed his eyes and tried to block it out, but the voice grew louder and more insistent. He felt like he was being consumed by the darkness.\n\nJust when he thought he couldn't take it anymore, the voice stopped, and the room was filled with an eerie silence. Jack's eyes snapped open, and his heart leaped into his throat. A shadowy figure towered over him, its form barely discernible in the dim light. It was tall and thin, with long, spindly limbs and glowing red eyes that seemed to burn into Jack's soul. Its razor-sharp claws glinted in the darkness, poised to strike.\n\nWith a bloodcurdling scream, Jack scrambled backward, his heart racing like a freight train. But the figure was too fast. It reached out with lightning speed and seized Jack by the chest, its claws sinking deep into his flesh. Jack felt a searing pain that was like nothing he had ever experienced before, like his very heart was being ripped out of his body.\n\nPanic surged through Jack's veins as he fought against the creature's grip, but it was like trying to move a mountain. The creature's strength was beyond anything Jack could comprehend. His vision began to swim as he felt himself slipping away, his life force ebbing out of him.\n\nJust as he thought he was about to die, the creature vanished into thin air, leaving Jack lying on the bed, gasping for air. He clutched at his chest, feeling the ragged edges of the wounds the creature had inflicted. His body trembled with a mixture of fear and pain as he struggled to catch his breath.\n\nWhen Jack finally managed to sit up, his clothes and blankets were soaked with sweat, and his body felt like it had been through a war. He looked around the room, half-expecting to see the shadowy figure lurking in the corners. But there was nothing there, only the eerie silence of the night. He checked his body for the wounds he felt so clearly before, but there were none. \n\nDespite the warmth of his blankets, Jack couldn't shake the chill that had settled deep in his bones. \n\nHe had no memory of what had happened after the creature attacked him, but he knew that he had to stop using the radio. After getting up from bed with what felt like a severe hangover, he packed the radio away in a box and vowed never to use it again.\n\nBut the strange happenings didn't stop. Jack mentioned several times that he continued to see shadowy figures and hear strange voices, even when he wasn't using the radio. He knew that he was being haunted by something dark and sinister, and he didn't know how to stop it.\n\nThe radio had opened a door to a world of darkness, and he had unwittingly stepped inside. He closed his eyes and prayed for deliverance, but deep down, he knew that the nightmare was far from over.\n\nHe couldn't shake the feeling that there was something sinister and otherworldly behind the strange happenings that had been plaguing him. He couldn't understand how the radio, a harmless device, had unleashed something so terrifying.\n\n23-03-08, when Jack came home from work, there was a package outside his door. He hadn’t ordered anything, so he was a bit confused but took it inside and opened it.\n\nIt was an old book.\n\nJack had some trouble recognizing it, but he thought it seemed familiar.\n\nSuddenly a bolt of realization struck him. It was one of the books that he had seen sitting on the table among the other Soviet-era items at the yard sale where he purchased the radio!\n\nHe opened the book and began to read. To his surprise, he found that it contained detailed information about the Duga-3 radar and the experiments that had been conducted there. This confirmed the research he had been doing earlier, but this is the first time he heard about any experiments.\n\nAs he read, Jack's heart began to race. He realized that the strange signals he had been picking up on his radio were not just interference from nearby electronic devices. They were remnants of the experiments that had been conducted by the Soviet government around the Chernobyl site and were concentrated on the Duga-3 radar.\n\nThe book explained that the Duga-3 radar had been used for more than just missile defense during the Cold War. It had been used for a series of highly classified experiments and rituals that involved summoning dark and malevolent forces.\n\nThe Soviet government had been obsessed with the idea of harnessing supernatural forces for military purposes, and they had spared no expense in their pursuit of these dark powers. They had gathered a team of scientists, occultists, and psychics to conduct these experiments, and they had used the massive energy output of the Duga-3 radar to amplify their efforts\n\nAt first, the experiments seemed like a failure. The scientists and psychics had reported strange visions and feelings, but nothing concrete had come of it. However, as the experiments progressed, the dark forces that they were trying to summon began to take notice.\n\nJack felt a cold sweat break out on his forehead as he read on. The book described how the scientists and occultists involved in the experiments had reported strange visions and feelings, and how some of them had even disappeared under mysterious circumstances. The book also contained detailed information about the strange symbols and rituals that had been used to summon the dark forces.\n\nJack knew that he had stumbled upon something far beyond his understanding or control. He had unwittingly invited the darkness into his life, and now he didn't know how to stop it.\n\nAs he closed the book, Jack felt a creeping sense of unease. He knew that he had to destroy the radio and anything else that might be connected to the experiments at the Duga-3 radar. But he also knew that it might already be too late.\n\nOver the next few days, Jack tried to destroy the radio, but he found that it was impossible to get rid of. It was as if the radio had taken on a life of its own, and it was determined to keep broadcasting the strange signals that had opened the door to the darkness.\n\nThe strange happenings in his apartment continued, and Jack began to see shadowy figures and hear strange whispers wherever he went. He knew that he was being haunted by something dark and sinister, and he didn't know how to stop it.\n\nOne night, as he was lying in bed, logged as 23-03-13, the radio suddenly turned on by itself. The strange signals poured out of the speakers of the radio. He sat up, feeling a sense of dread wash over him. He knew that he had to destroy the radio once and for all, but he also knew that it might be too late.\n\nAs he reached for the radio, he heard a voice, deep and gravelly, coming through the speakers. It was a voice that he recognized, and yet it was also different, twisted, and warped as it belonged to something beyond human comprehension.\n\nThe voice spoke to him, in a language that he didn't understand but that seemed to resonate deep within his soul. It promised him power, knowledge, and immortality, in exchange for his soul.\n\nJack tried to resist, but he felt himself being pulled toward the darkness. He knew that he had made a terrible mistake and that there was no way to turn back.\n\nAs the voice grew louder and more insistent, Jack felt himself slipping away, consumed by the darkness that he had unwittingly invited into his life. And at that moment, he knew that he had sealed his fate.\n\nThe note was hard to read toward the end. the letters were so hastily scrambled down it took all my concentration to figure out what was written.\n\nI hadn’t noticed it, but the last page was filled with strange symbols around the borders and had stains of blood on it. \n\nMy mind was stuck on the last entry, dated 23-03-13. I checked the date on my phone. That was yesterday. This happened yesterday.\n\nThe radio suddenly turned on, making me jump. \n\nFirst, loud static. \n\nThen I heard that strange tapping sound. \n\nThe Russian Woodpecker.",

        "text": "“Stop! Think about your children, your grandchildren. Layla is only six-weeks old, she’ll never know her grandfather!”\n\nTom Flores, who I had known for 25 years, was standing on top of a kid’s jungle gym in his backyard. His feet tip-toeing on a thin metal rail, like some half-ass tightrope-walker. He leaned forward, his chest aimed towards the ground. \n\nThe bend in his hips gave gravity the edge, a few more inches and he’d tilt to the point of no return. If he fell it was only about a six-foot drop, but it wasn’t the height that would kill him.\n\nBelow him was his old climbing pick-axe, he’d shoved it into the mud, point side up. \n\nTom was going to impale himself. \n\nEven though we’d known each other for a quarter of a century, I wouldn’t call Tom a friend, though he once was. Things beyond our control made it complicated, as you’ll learn, for our friendship to have survived. But we had many things in common that kept us in each other’s orbit, including a horrific secret we shared. \n\nHe was the only one in the world who understood the dread I lived with, the soul crushing weight I carried around each day. It burdened him as well, and was why he was about to drive a spike through his lungs.\n\nThe skeleton in our closet was we’d killed a seven-year-old girl two decades earlier. The same girl who was sitting on the jungle gym next to Tom. Sitting and staring at him.\n\nHer name was Kate.\n\n“Please Tom, don’t. This won’t change anything.” I pleaded, taking a step towards him. \n\nKate shifted her glance my way. \n\nI stopped. My fear seizing every muscle in place. I hated when she looked at me.\n\nTom replied, “It won’t change, it’ll never change, but if I’m dead I don’t have to see her ever again.” He looked down at Kate, whose soul crushing gaze was back on him.\n\nTom teetered on the thin metal bar he stood on, his flannel shirt caught in the wind, his grey hair looked yellow in the sun.\n\nWe had stayed in touch, helping one another whenever the guilt and fear pushed us to the edge. His frantic voicemail had me in his backyard at that moment.\n\nKate sat there and watched. Wearing what she always wore, the clothes she had on when she died. A red North Face down jacket. Her red hair wet and matted, her face a cold blue.\n\nTom started to cry, through his sobs he muttered, “The others were lucky. Cancer, I wished for it, hoped I’d get it. Prostate. Lung. Whatever, please god, please make me sick!”\n\nHe was talking about Rachel Cross and Vince Bota the two other members of our Search and Rescue team. \n\nWe all went up the mountain that day and when we came down, we were haunted; figuratively and literally by what happened. None of us thought we would kill an innocent 8-year-old.\n\nRachel and Vince had both died of cancer in their late thirties, just ten years after the “accident”. If stress can truly bring on illness, then their deaths made sense, since having a dead girl haunt you ever single day of your life would strain anyone to the point of breaking.\n\nVince had become a raging alcoholic and was in an out of rehab and prisons. Leukemia struck him down at the age of 38.\n\nRachel lived alone. A shut-in. I hadn’t seen her for five years before she died of breast cancer.\n\nBoth were haunted by Kate and both took their secret about what happened up on the mountain to their graves. Now, it was just Tom and I who knew.\n\nTom crouched and sat down on the metal bar, a measure of sanity regained.\n\nKate, climbed off the jungle gym and walked into the woods that edged Tom’s yard. Just before she stepped into the forest, she turned and looked and pointed at us.\n\nThen she was gone. \n\nKate never said anything, she would just appear and then leave. Sometimes she’d  be there for hours, other times just a fleeting moment. A spectral reminder of what we did to her.\n\nI helped Tom down and pulled the pick-axe out of the ground.\n\nHe was a blubbering mess.\n\n“I can’t take it anymore. I can’t. I just want her to go away.”\n\nI patted Tom on the back, reassuring.\n\n“Let’s go inside, get something to drink. You always have a bottle of Glenlivet around.”\n\nSuddenly Tom lunged at me, his hands to my throat. His thumbs pressed against my windpipe. I struggled against his grasp. \n\n“It’s because of you! You did this! You were the one and because of you we all suffered!”\n\nAs he yelled spittle flew from his mouth and splattered my face. He was enraged.\n\nHis suicidal thoughts had transformed to murderous ones.\n\nI struggled to release his grip. There was a buzzing in my ear, my lips felt numb. I was drifting into unconsciousness. I thrust the pick-axe, handle side first, into Tom’s groin. A muffled thud.\n\nAs his grip loosened, I was able to push him away.\n\nHe fell to the ground, moaning.\n\nI caught my breath and stamped out of the yard to my car, shouting back, “It was all of us, we agreed it was all of us!”\n\nWhen I got home, I rushed up the stairs. As I took the steps, two at a time, my husband Gary’s voice called out, “Don’t forget your pills!” It was a little game we played, him reminding me, and me never taking them. The truth was I knew I didn’t need any pills.\n\nMy medication was a sham. \n\nA way to explain away my anxiety, my fear, my night sweats and daytime trembles. I was diagnosed with panic attacks, but I knew what really caused me to break down and cry at the dinner table every other night.\n\nKate standing there and staring as I lifted each forkful of food. \n\nIt wasn’t a panic attack that caused me to rush out of the auditorium during my son’s middle-school concert. It was Kate, standing behind him as he played his violin.\n\nChristmas morning ruined, not because of anxiety, but the terror of Kate sitting next to me as we unwrapped presents. My daughter worried, asked me, “Are you ok Mommy, Christmas is supposed to be happy.” As I sobbed so hard my shoulders heaved in front of her.\n\nHundreds upon hundreds of moments over the years, of me reduced to a hyperventilating, crying, terrified shell of a person. I understood why Tom was going to drive a spike through his chest, I wanted it stopped too. \n\nThere was something that I thought might end it. To escape Kate’s hold on our lives. It wasn’t a noose around my neck, or a gunshot to the head, but something simpler.\n\nI made my way into the attic, standing there when I noticed Tom’s pick-axe was still in my hand. It slipped from my grasp and fell to the floor. I was up there searching for my old box of gear from when it happened.\n\nI found it behind my grandmother’s old sewing machine. The jacket was still inside. On the back of it in red letters were the words  – “Mount Washington Search and Rescue”.\n\nI put it on. It still smelled of pine and it still held memories.\n\nMemories of what happened. \n\nI closed my eyes and I was back on Mount Washington in New Hampshire.\n\nThe call came in to the rescue center, a family trapped on the mountain. It was April, the worst time of year for people getting in trouble and dying up there.\n\nMount Washington was known for having the worst weather on earth. Unbelievable winds that drove pellets of ice through the air like bullets. The problem with April was that one minute it could be 60 degrees and sunny and in an instant change to blizzard conditions.\n\nThe mountain towered to around 6000 feet so snow and ice still covered the higher elevations even though it was spring. You’d start off hiking in warm sunny conditions but if you rambled too high up the peak, you were suddenly in the death zone.\n\nTom, Rachel, Vince, and myself were bounding up the mountain. We had the family in our sights in less than an hour. A mix of snow and rain pelted us as we got close.\n\nIt was supposed to be a family we were coming to aid, a mother, father and daughter, but all we saw were the parents. They were sitting against a boulder, huddled together trying to stay warm.\n\nI was the first one there, when I asked the father if he was ok, he turned to me and showed me his hands. They were bloodied ribbons of flesh, scraped to the bone.\n\n He spoke in an almost trance like voice, which I realized was shock, “She…she’s there, buried under there.” Pointing his bloody finger to a mixed pile of snow and ice.\n\n“Who’s buried?”, I asked.\n\nThe mother replied, “Our daughter, Kate.”\n\nBy that time, Vince, Rachel and Tom had joined me. Vince immediately went to work on the father, tending to his wounds. Rachel got an emergency blanket around the mother, doing her best to keep her from falling into hypothermia.\n\nWe learned they were hiking when they were overcome by an avalanche. A jumble of snow and ice cascading from above. The mother and father managed to get behind a boulder, but Kate had tripped and in an instant was carried away. Buried beneath a huge slab of ice.\n\nThe father tried digging his daughter out using only his hands. He didn’t have gloves, because when they started their hike it was a perfect spring day. Smiles and sunshine replaced by tears and dread.\n\nTom and I used our pick axes to chip away the ice. \n\n“There, I see her, she’s wearing a red jacket.” Kate was buried beneath a foot of frozen slush. I reached in, my fingers found the collar of her coat and I was able to wrestle her out of her glacial tomb.\n\nI pulled of my gloves and I checked for a heartbeat and any sign of breathing. My fingers pressed against her slender wrist, hoping for that clockwork-like thump. I did the same on the artery on her neck.\n\nHer skin was cold and a dull blue-grey hue, including her lips, their warm pink color missing and never to be seen again.\n\n“Nothing, I’m not getting any pulse, on her neck or wrist.”\n\nKate was dead, probably had been for over an hour.\n\nTom’s eyes were swollen red, he fought back tears. In Search and Rescue death was a constant, but there was something about a dead child that always cut you down and hurt like hell.\n\nAside from some nicks and cuts around her face, Kate looked serene. If there was any comfort in the moment, it was she died quickly and probably didn’t suffer. The coroner would give us the details when we brought the body down off the mountain.\n\nI pulled some pebbles out of her red wet hair. For some strange reason I thought of my wedding and my mother pulling rice from my veil after we had left the church steps. Little Kate would never have that moment.\n\nLike Tom I started to cry.\n\nRachel and Vince stayed with the parents as Tom zipped the young girl into a black body bag. \n\nIt was near sunset and the conditions had worsened to below freezing temps and falling snow. The idea of hiking down with the badly injured father and hypothermic, grieving mother seemed like a sure way to compound the tragedy.\n\nI decided we’d make our way across the scree lined slope and spend the night at the Lake of the Clouds hut, which was closed to the public that time of year. It was nothing more than a cabin with beds. There was no electricity, but it would be out of the elements.\n\nOnce inside, Tom and I brought Kate down into the basement of the hut, her body still zipped up tight in the bag.\n\nI didn’t want it to be out in view of the parents as we tried to calm and care for them.\n\nWe made our way down into the dark cellar. There was no light, just the beams from our headlamps. \n\nI held her shoulders through the bag and Tom her feet. She weighed about 50 pounds and was tall for her age. As gentle as we could we laid Kate down at the foot of the stairs. \n\nBefore leaving her, I knelt and laid my hand on the body bag and said a silent prayer. Then we left her resting against the bottom step.\n\nThe plan was Tom and I would leave first light in the morning, before the parents, giving us time to maneuver our way off the mountain while carrying the body.\n\nMost of that night we spent lending our deepest sympathies to the parents, letting them know they didn’t do anything wrong. There’s a reason the word accident exists.\n\nTom and I were up the next morning before the others. Rachel and Vince would slowly guide the parents down about an hour behind us.\n\nThe day was bright. The sun beaming in through the hut’s windows. It seemed too cheery of a day for what we had to do. Grey thick clouds that weighed down the mountain would have been more appropriate than the bluebird sky outside the hut that morning.\n\nGeared up and ready, I opened the basement door. \n\nThe light from the main cabin spilled down into the darkness.\n\nKate’s body bag wasn’t there.\n\n“What the hell.” Tumbled from my mouth as I stared down to where the body should have been, at the bottom of the stairs.\n\nTom was confused, “What? What is it?”\n\n“Did you move the body?”\n\n“Move it? Why would I?”\n\n“It’s not there.”\n\nRachel and Vince were up and awake by that time, getting ready.\n\nI called to them in a hushed voice, asking them the same.\n\nThey both reacted like Tom, their head’s shaking “no” in unison.\n\nI had Vince check the parent’s room to see if they had brought Kate up during the night to have her in their room.\n\nHe came back, “Nope, their asleep and it’s just them.”\n\nI looked down again just to make sure, but Kate wasn’t there.\n\nThe four of us made our way into the cellar. Our flashlights piercing the darkness, raking the floor of the basement, searching for Kate.\n\nTom’s beam found the black body bag, it had rolled across the room against a stack of old broken snowshoes.\n\nKate was still in it.\n\nI looked at the bag, confused and shocked. I called out to all of them.\n\n“If any of you moved her and didn’t say anything, now would be a good time to tell me.”\n\nTheir silence was the answer.\n\nVince pulled the body bag to the center of the room.\n\nWe knelt around it. \n\nI pulled down the zipper. \n\nRachel gasped, “God no.” when I peeled the bag open.\n\nThere was Kate, her face frozen in a perpetual scream. Her lips curled over her teeth, eye’s bulging. A horrific visage of terror.\n\nHer hands were up by her cheeks, fingers bent and spread in a clawing gesture, as if she was trying to scratch her way out of the bag like some wild animal caught in a trap.\n\nBits of black rubber beneath her fingernails confirmed that’s what she was trying to do.\n\nClawing and screaming.\n\nTom wailed, “Don’t tell me she was alive when I put her in that bag…don’t. Sweet Jesus no! You said she was dead! You checked and told me she was dead!”\n\nI begged Tom to quiet down, he’d wake the parents. I didn’t want them to see their daughter like this and I also didn’t want them to know what happened.\n\nI stared at Kate trying to make sense of what I was seeing. \n\nRachel kept her refrain going, “God no…oh god no.” She backed into the corner, trying to distance herself from the horror before us.\n\nVince, who was a paramedic, knew what happened. \n\n“Like when those kids fell through the ice in Jackson. They brought them up 70 minutes after they were under. No pulse, no breathing. It’s the cold, It’s like a mini-hibernation. The heart beats imperceptibly, barely pumping enough blood only to the brain and lungs. If you went to check her pulse on her wrist or even neck, you would have missed it.”\n\nKate had warmed up in the body bag. When she came to, she was terrified, not knowing where she was. Alone, imprisoned. \n\nFighting to get out of the bag she rolled herself across the floor. Her screams trapped in the rubber coffin and dark cellar. We didn’t hear her calling for help.\n\nThe body bag is meant to be airtight, so no decomposing odors can escape, but that also means no air can get in. \n\nShe used up whatever oxygen that was left.\n\n“She suffocated to death.” I murmured.\n\nTom had another theory, “Yeah, maybe it was more like she was scared to death, trapped in the bag I zipped her up in, trying to get out, not knowing where she was…”, before Tom finished his thought he made a run at me. \n\nVince held him back. For the next ten minutes there was more pointing and accusations and blame shared.\n\nThat’s when we made our pact. We had just spent the night telling Kate’s parents that what happened was an accident, it wasn’t their fault. The same applied to us.\n\nNothing good would come if word got out that we were all involved in the death of a little girl. \n\nRachel and Vince, protested, insisting they weren’t the ones to declare her dead, or zip her up in the bag. But in the end they knew no one would remember who did what and their reputations who be ruined like Tom’s or mine.\n\nWe swore to each other that we’d never tell anyone what really happened.\n\nI reached into the bag and pulled Kate’s clawed hands down from her face. Then wiped away the slivers of black rubber underneath her fingertips and gently closed her eyelids. \n\nNo one would ever know, except the four of us…and Kate.\n\nWe had our secret, but she would never let us forget what we had done, what I had done.\n\nBut after twenty-two years I can’t do it anymore, keep this bottled up inside. Seeing Tom earlier, the utter depth of his anguish and desperation, there’s only one thing I can do.\n\nI’m ending our pact.\n\nYou’re reading this now because I finally need to take responsibility for the tragic mistake I made on that mountain. A little girl died that day because of me. \n\nBut I made things worse by also setting my friend’s lives down a terrible path.\n\nInstead of owning up to Kate’s death and bearing the consequences, I lied and forced others to join me in a lie. As they say, it’s not the crime, it’s the cover-up that makes things worse. And I made things so much worse, destroying lives and perpetuating an enduring carnage. It’s washed over everything like a wave of misery each and every year since that terrible day.\n\nI ask Tom to forgive me, that hopefully my confession can release him from this nightmare. He did nothing wrong, it was me, my fault alone.\n\nRachel and Vince are dead, I have faith they’ll know that I’m done including them in my falsehood. Their deaths, like Kate are a tragedy that I created, my sins to bear.\n\nI beg everyone reading this to give me a small bit of absolution, to understand I didn’t mean to kill Kate.\n\nI can see Kate now, she’s standing in the corner watching me as I type. I mean this with all my heart, forgive me Kate. I hope you find peace.\n\nI can hear the wind whispering through the trees outside my bedroom window as I sit in front of my laptop. Whispers often carry secrets, mine is now carried out to the world.\n\nSometimes guilt can haunt you just like a ghost.",

        "text": "'I was getting ready for bed when I heard a rustling noise from my backyard, as I was home alone that night I decided to check it out as only my 2 puppies would be awake at night and I don't want them to be in danger.\n\nI checked the rose bushes that surround the fence in my garden, Nothing was there.\n\nAs I was about to go back into my house I heard the rustling again, this time it was closer to me. I stopped moving, a force started gripping at my arms, I grew weak, the everything went dark.\n\nI woke up in a room, It was too bright to see anything. I think it's a white room. I can just about make out a silhouette of a woman, I think she has long brunette hair. She's wearing a psychiatrist uniform. I'm not crazy. I don't have mental health issues. What is going on?\n\n\"Good morning Alexander. How are you feeling?\" The psychiatrist asked, I can finally see her clearly, She has Brunette hair with emerald green eyes.\n\n\"W-who are you? and why am I here?!\" I exclaimed, The brunette then explained that on THAT night I was attacked and got severely injured on my head and fell into a coma for a month or so, and apparently lost my memory. Wait, I think I know her, I think she's my ex-girlfriend.\n\n\"Anyway, would you like to go on a walk with me dear?\" The psychiatrist questioned, she has a name tag on, it says that her name is Scarlet. I know Scarlet, She's my friend, not my ex-girlfriend. I nodded then I went to look at my clothes. They were white and grey. White is probably the worst colour to wear but I don't mind.\n\nWhile me and Scarlet were on our walk, We saw other people, in the same position as I am. Everything went black again.' \n\nSomeone finished reading everything in my diary. I was blindfolded and I think I was handcuffed to a chair. I can't move. I can't talk. I can't see. I'm shaking. I'm feeling as if I'm going to die. I am going to die. This is the end.\n\nSuddenly, someone took the handcuffs of me and pulled me into a hug. Who is hugging me? I don't know. They take the blindfold of me. It's Scarlet. I try to talk but all that comes out is a screech. Scarlet assures me that I'm in safe hands. I don't believe her. I feel as if she's going to kill me. I try to push her away but all that happens is her tightening her grip. \n\nScarlet pulls away from the hug and.. she gets shot.As her body falls to the ground, I started crying. \"My- My friend\" I stuttered. Her blood splattered all over me. I kneel down next to her limp body, holding her in a tight hug. I hold her more tightly as I feel a presence behind me. The presence of a killer. A man who just killed my best friend. He sits next to me. The man is... My Father? My 'father' spoke up, \"She wasn't who you thought it was.\" The man beside me disappears. Scarlet disappears, but her blood remains on me. I take a look around the room. It's my bedroom. I wasn't here before. How'd I get here? Someone help me get out of this world.",

        "text": "I was elated when I first started my job as a nurse at the hospital. My passion for helping others and my desire to make a positive impact in the world had driven me to pursue a career in healthcare, and I felt like all of my hard work and dedication was finally paying off. Fresh out of nursing school, I was eager to put my newly acquired skills and knowledge to the test and make a difference in the lives of my patients. \n\nHowever, as the days went by, I started to feel a growing sense of unease. At first, it was just small, fleeting moments - a glimmer in the corner of my eye, a sudden chill that seemed to come from nowhere. But soon, strange and unsettling occurrences began to take place with increasing frequency. I would enter a patient's room, only to find their heart monitor flatlining, even though they were stable just moments before. I would hear footsteps echoing down the halls when no one was there. \n\nThese events were unsettling, to say the least, and they seemed to happen more and more often as time went on. I tried to shake them off, to tell myself that it was just my imagination playing tricks on me, but the persistence of these strange occurrences only grew stronger every day. The hospital was a labyrinth of halls and rooms, and the thought of being there alone, surrounded by the unknown, filled me with fear.\n\nI couldn't help but wonder what was really happening in the hospital. Was it just my imagination playing tricks on me, or was there something more sinister at play? The persistence of these strange and unsettling events only served to heighten my sense of unease, leaving me to question what was truly lurking in the shadows of the hospital.\n\nAs I made my way through the labyrinthine halls, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched. The quiet whispers and sudden chills that seemed to come from nowhere only added to my growing sense of unease.  \n\nThe hospital was a place of sickness and suffering, and at night, it felt like a completely different world. The sterile white walls seemed to close in on me, and the endless labyrinth of halls seemed to stretch on forever. The thought of being alone there, surrounded by the darkness and the unknown, was almost too much to bear.\n\nBut still, I found myself drawn to the hospital night after night, unable to shake the feeling that something was waiting for me in the shadows. The mysterious voices and shadows only served to heighten my sense of fear and unease, leaving me to wonder what was really lurking in the labyrinthine halls of the hospital.\n\nOne evening, as I was working the graveyard shift, I heard a strange noise coming from one of the abandoned wings of the hospital. My curiosity got the better of me, I decided to investigate. What I found was a dusty old room, filled with medical equipment from decades past.  \n\nThe equipment was old and outdated, but it evoked a wave of nostalgia in me, reminding me of a time when medicine was more straightforward and less complicated.\n\nDespite the cobwebs and the dust, there was something almost beautiful about the room. The warm glow of the dim lighting and the soft hum of the machines created an almost peaceful atmosphere, and I found myself lingering there for a moment, lost in thought. \n\nBut then, I remembered where I was and why I was there. I quickly snapped back to reality, and a shiver ran down my spine as I realized that I was alone in an abandoned wing of the hospital, surrounded by outdated medical equipment.  \n\nAs I explored the room, I noticed something strange. One of the machines, an antique electroconvulsive therapy machine, seemed to be turned on. I approached the machine, feeling a mixture of curiosity and dread.  \n\nAs I reached out to turn off the machine, a hand suddenly shot out from the shadows and grabbed mine. I screamed, but the hand was unrelenting, pulling me closer to the machine.  \n\nAnd that's when I saw it - a patient who had been declared dead years ago, still strapped to the machine, receiving electric shocks.\n\nThe sight was horrifying, and I was frozen with fear. The patient's skin was pale and lifeless, and the sound of the electric shocks was like a constant, haunting hum in the background. I tried to pull away, but the hand was too strong, and I was powerless to escape its grasp. \n\nI was paralyzed with fear as I realized the truth. The disturbances in the hospital, the flatlining monitors, the footsteps echoing in the halls - they were all caused by the persistence of the hospital's dark past, where patients were subjected to inhumane treatments in the name of medicine. And I was trapped, alone in the hospital with the ghost of the patient, still receiving electric shocks after all these years.\n\nThe souls of the departed are never truly at peace.",

I want to give you a bit of context quickly: i am staying at my aunt's house for a few weeks to take care of the place because she just had surgery and needs to stay in the hospital for a long time.\n\nThis all started four nights ago,when i woke up at 2:30 A.M. to use the bathroom. My aunt's house has two floors, my bedroom was located on the top floor and the bathroom was on the ground one. While i was on the toilet i heard super fast footsteps run past the door, which was strange since I was the only person in the house. I decided to ignore this weird phenomenon and go back to bed. \n\nDuring the day i never thought of what had happened the night before,until the next night. This time i heard the footsteps while i was still in my room, they were bashing on the ground floor at an insane speed. \"What the fuck?\" I thought,while being terrified for my life. They randomly stopped,just like the first time,only this time they didnt come from the bathroom area,but from the kitchen. After that,they moved again, this time to the living room and then to the dining room,but they never came close to the second floor. \n\nTonight was different. I heard them rush up the stairs and stop in front of my door. Two knocks came afterwards,accompanied by my aunt's voice: \"Alex,let me in dear,the sink isn't working\", said that creature,attempting to act like my aunt but failing miserably. It seemed like this creature could kind of imitate human speech but not in a realistic way. The voice was monotone and the way it pronounced words felt.... off. It knocked again, this time asking the same question but in a different tone, a demanding one.\n\n I stayed frozen in my spot,not daring to move or respond to whatever that shit behind my door was,even though it kept begging to be let in. Its words slowly became cries, brutal and animalistic cries that even the most mentally resilient would have found unbearable. Eventually it stopped and the footsteps started again,this time going downstairs. \n\nYou might be thinking that thing should be gone by now right? Then why do i still feel its presence lurking behind that door? I am afraid of what will happen to me when i will eventually have to open it since if i don't i will starve to death.The only question i have right now is why was i its target, did it know i heard the footsteps every single night or did it just randomly decide to feast on me? I'll try to keep you updated if i survive.",

I want to give you a bit of context quickly: i am staying at my aunt's house for a few weeks to take care of the place because she just had surgery and needs to stay in the hospital for a long time. This all started four nights ago,when i woke up at 2:30 A.M. to use the bathroom. My aunt's house has two floors, my bedroom was located on the top floor and the bathroom was on the ground one. While i was on the toilet i heard super fast footsteps run past the door, which was strange since I was the only person in the house. I decided to ignore this weird phenomenon and go back to bed. During the day i never thought of what had happened the night before,until the next night. This time i heard the footsteps while i was still in my room, they were bashing on the ground floor at an insane speed. \"What the fuck?\" I thought,while being terrified for my life. They randomly stopped,just like the first time,only this time they didnt come from the bathroom area,but from the kitchen. After that,they moved again, this time to the living room and then to the dining room,but they never came close to the second floor. Tonight was different. I heard them rush up the stairs and stop in front of my door. Two knocks came afterwards,accompanied by my aunt's voice: \"Alex,let me in dear,the sink isn't working\", said that creature,attempting to act like my aunt but failing miserably. It seemed like this creature could kind of imitate human speech but not in a realistic way. The voice was monotone and the way it pronounced words felt.... off. It knocked again, this time asking the same question but in a different tone, a demanding one. I stayed frozen in my spot,not daring to move or respond to whatever that shit behind my door was,even though it kept begging to be let in. Its words slowly became cries, brutal and animalistic cries that even the most mentally resilient would have found unbearable. Eventually it stopped and the footsteps started again,this time going downstairs. You might be thinking that thing should be gone by now right? Then why do i still feel its presence lurking behind that door? I am afraid of what will happen to me when i will eventually have to open it since if i don't i will starve to death.The only question i have right now is why was i its target, did it know i heard the footsteps every single night or did it just randomly decide to feast on me? I'll try to keep you updated if i survive.",

        "text": "My family doesn’t eat meat after 6pm. I’d always thought this was normal, that other families followed this seemingly basic principle. It wasn’t until I moved out that I learned how weird of a thing this was; that other families didn’t adhere to what I had always thought to be a fundamental dietary guideline. Only *my* family believed in **The Consequence.** \n\nFor nearly two decades I refrained from eating meat after the clock struck six, regardless of how much of a craving I happened to have for it. Even if there was plenty left, and I hadn’t finished my plate, I was expected to either scrape the remains into the trash – *so much food wasted* – or put it in a Tupperware container for the next day.  \n\nI always tried to get home soon enough to eat dinner before then, but with school and extracurricular activities, that wasn’t always possible. I remember when I’d just finished hosting a session for an afterschool club, and was on my way home –starving, hadn’t eaten all day – when I got a text from my father saying that he had bundled all the meat up, and to not expect any left out. He’d sent the text at 5:47pm. I arrived home feeling disappointed, but quickly got over it as it was simply something that had to be done. It was, for us, normal.  \n\nThe fear of The Consequence guided our lives.  \n\nBecause of how integral it was to my family, I had never once brought up the topic with friends. Much like how you probably wouldn’t bring up the fact that you put your dishes in the sink or dishwasher, it was never conversationally relevant to bring up our no-meat-after-six rule. To me, it was mundane, unremarkable.  \n\nIt might sound like this was an odd though ultimately harmless restriction; a familial eccentricity, which many families have in one way or another. And, in one way, you’re right. I wasn’t abused, I slipped up once and while it was treated gravely – given a stern though not frighteningly heated warning – there was no traumatic punishment, physical or otherwise. There was some leniency in the exaction of The Consequence with regards to children.   \n\nBut The Consequence itself was so utterly bizarre, so needlessly grim, that its very existence made the whole thing unforgivable. I would’ve rather been raised vegan, lived a life bereft of meat for some allegedly noble cause, than the one I had. Because that knowledge, that ever-lurking fear, messed me up in other ways. I don’t have PTSD, and neither do I have some psychological block preventing me from eating meat after 6pm – thank God – but I do have knowledge of The Consequence, and I’d do ***anything*** to forget it. \n\nWhen I shared that knowledge with my girlfriend, and how I still adhered to it – something she hadn’t consciously noticed - she left me. And not only did she leave me, she called me a lunatic. Me, who had never once said anything certifiably crazy. Me, who’d treated her with care, respect, and kindness; with an unblemished record of staunch sanity.  \n\nAll because of The Fucking Consequence.  \n\nShe left yesterday, and in doing so took all of her things from my apartment, which included most of the cookware; since she’d brought hers over in the absence of my own. I’d relied on the microwave and an air fryer prior to her moving in. Back to such lowly states, I bought a Hot Pocket after an unusually exhausting day at work; that olden dinner upon which many have relied throughout the ages. *Cheeseburger flavor.* Additionally, I bought a bag of those low-fat, air-fried chicken tenders, to supplement the totally nutritious meal. I was physically tired, and emotionally wrecked.  \n\nI guess in the grief of my heartbreak I had thought it worthwhile to share the events with my cousin during the drive home, with whom I’d always felt a close, brotherly connection. Well, he apparently felt it necessary to tell my parents after the call ended, who took it upon themselves to come visit me.  \n\nWhile sitting at my small dinner table, eating my hot pocket and tendies, there came a few knocks at the door to my apartment. I got up, answered, and – bewildered – let my parents in. My mom hugged me, my dad gave me a knowing and solemn pat on the shoulder and told me in many words that I'd be fine, that I’d find someone better. Absentmindedly, I brought them into the kitchen and offered them some tenders, since I’d cooked the whole bag.  \n\nI hadn’t paid attention to the time – ironically, hadn’t thought of the one that had ended my relationship. My mom’s face was the first to change. It went from sympathetically despondent to confused, and then to horrified. My dad’s reaction was a a little belated, as if he couldn’t quite fathom the events. His expression of fatherly contrition slowly melted into a snarl; a visage of mounting contempt. Finally, glancing over at the microwave’s clock, I realized what I’d done.  \n\nSpeechless, my mother merely stood at the threshold of the kitchen. My father, equally voiceless, gently pushed past her and headed toward the front door. I heard the lock click, and then he returned – his face grimly set.et, resolute.  \n\nStunned, I sat there at the table, the cheap meat churning in my gut. My plate – the half-eaten hot pocket and chicken tender crumbs – suddenly seemed like a profane thing; I wanted to sweep it off the table. \n\nAfter guiding my mother to a seat, my father went and leaned against the kitchen counter, his hands clasped together. He looked like a pastor in prayer, his posture almost reverent. A terrible, baleful silence fell upon the kitchen, like the sudden hush of an audience before a public execution.  \n\n“Oh, my son. My baby.” \n\nMy mother’s shaky voice almost broke me. I met her eyes, and she averted them. Like she couldn’t bear to look at me, her own son.  \n\nI tried to apologize, but my mouth was suddenly dry. The room suddenly felt hot, stifling. I couldn’t seem to breathe, let alone form the words. Slowly, things started to feel wrong. \n\nAnxiety reared itself like a massive wave. My vision swam, objects becoming blurred, indistinct, amorphous. My own parents became like phantoms, shifting and immaterial. I gripped the table for balance, for stability, as if I were the one losing corporeality.  \n\n“It’s happening. To *my* son. Oh my God.” \n\nI’d never heard my father sound so defeated. His voice almost brought me back, almost reversed the nauseating unreality of my sudden affliction. In my mounting delirium my mother’s whimpering sounded almost musical. *Sing-song.* Like a lullaby she’d whisper-sing to me as a child. \n\nWhen I felt my face begin to slide free from my skull, I screamed. But it was altered, distorted as my lips came loose. As my tongue followed in their wake. As if taking on the burden, my mother let out a scream of her own. To me, the world was now no more than a kaleidoscopic maelstrom of images, one of which was my maniacally shrieking mother. \n\nThe rest of my body fell apart in turn. Bits crumbled away, layers sloughed off; fluids leaked and oozed.  \n\nWhen there was finally just my skeleton, held together by strips and stubborn sinew, my father began cleaning up the mess. My mother’s mind was pretty much gone – she’d screamed herself senseless. Unable to move, lacking the connective tissue to do so, I just sat and watched as my remains were collected and deposited into a bucket he’d gotten from beneath my sink. \n\nThe stuff – *the meat* – was then slowly poured into the sink. The grinding and gurgling of the garbage disposal as it worked to break up my flesh somehow calmed me. Would’ve soothed my nerves if I’d still had them.  \n\nWhen the deed was done, he lifted my bony hand and placed it gently on the table, then did the same with the other. I could only watch – my eyes hadn’t withered away. He then shuffled around the kitchen, and not finding what he was looking for, went searching throughout the apartment. I couldn’t guide him – not that I would’ve. I knew what he was searching for, and the last thing I wanted was for him to find it.  \n\nBut he found it, eventually.  \n\nHe set the toolbox on the kitchen table as if it were the most delicate thing in the world. It was old – it had been his – but it was sturdy, and the tools inside hadn’t been used once since he’d gifted them to me. With both hands, as if there were precious jewels inside, he raised the lid and removed the hammer and a few nails. He raised the hammer, then lowered it, and helped my mother out of her chair. He led her to my couch and returned, his expression pained, but set. He was ready, no matter how much it would hurt him – and me. \n\nA nail was placed atop my left hand. The hammer struck once. Twice. A second nail was placed on my right hand and was embedded to its head with three solid, table-shaking strikes. There was, somehow, *pain*. All that was left of me was bone, some flimsy pieces of dead flesh, and somehow, I *felt* it. More than just a vibration, I actually felt the puncturing of the bone, the fracturing of my hand. Some phantom skin sensation.  \n\nAffixed to the table in a seated crucifixion, I was a prisoner. I knew that I had every right to be, given what I’d done.  *What I’d do, if I were free*. And yet I was terrified. Appalled. By my father’s eyes, by what I had become. By what he’d done to me without so much as a few calming words.  \n\nThe stink of my discarded, ground flesh lingered, wafted up from the garbage disposal; the viscera still clinging to the pipes. I wanted to cry, wanted to scream. But I could only stare and suffer. And then the *urge* came, insidious and powerful. Like a switch had been flipped in my brain, the newly emergent psyche demanding that I perform the unthinkable. It galvanized me. Made my bones pulse and quiver. They rattled in place, and I heard my mother moan in fright. My father sat across from me, watching me with hammer in hand. And I, torn between minds –one terrified, the other unthinking, save for that deplorable impulse – stared back. That abysmal silence returned. \n\nWhen my skin began to grow back, the urge increased by magnitudes. I nearly lost myself completely to that abominable impulse.  \n\nMy parents left around the time that my face finished reconstituting itself. It felt new, so I’m sure it looked incredibly uncanny, probably more unnerving than the skeleton they’d stared at for nearly an hour. I thought I’d die when the skin formed around my hands. When those new nerves, excited to sense and feel, were unfairly bombarded by the sudden, inexpressibly excruciating sensation of those long nails in my hands, I let my mind fold into myself. I withdrew into an unthinking fugue. \n\nEven after I’d finished regenerating, I sat there for twenty, thirty minutes. Dreading to rip out the nails. To bring even greater agony upon myself. But I had to – and I did. Thank God I didn't have the voice for the pain; that my vocal chords hadn't yet grown taut enough to handle the sonic burden. I would've brought the whole complex running to my door with my screams. \n\nI know that had my father not done that, I would’ve done far worse to someone else. As something worse than a ghoul, as some kind of fleshless revenant; I would’ve gone on a monstrous prowl. Would’ve seized and devoured *someone.*  \n\nLong ago, centuries before my birth, some far-distant ancestor committed atrocities against a few fellow townspeople in some long-forgotten village. Either out of extreme desperation in dire circumstances, or simple sadistic gluttony. I never found out why. I just know that he committed terrible, anthropophagic crimes.  *Cannibalized multiple people.* \n\nThe people related to those he’d hurt were so devastated and subsequently filled with wrath that they employed all manner of curses and maledictions, dooming him and his kin – forever and ever – to unforeseeable and unpreventable malignancies and restrictions – Consequences - related to the consumption of meat. Not long after, an entire generation was rendered gastrointestinally incompatible with meat. Others down the line had been able to eat and eat and not get full, no matter the quality or content. I don’t think I could’ve lived with that polyphagic plague. Not for long. \n\nMy family? Our Consequence? For whatever reason, we cannot eat meat after 6pm, lest we shed our flesh and transform into hyper-ravenous fiends; skeletal nightmares who’d prey on friend, foe, or family in a frenzy of insatiable hunger. Unless we’re detained, “starved” for a period of time dependent upon factors seemingly beyond our control.  \n\nFor some, it’s hours; others, days. But the body eventually regenerates, and our humanity afterwards is, for the moment, restored. I’d never succumbed to that despicable, horrific state before. It was the most awful thing that’d ever happened to me.  \n\nNow, no matter the circumstance, I’ll never forget The Consequence. It’s not something I can afford to overlook or gamble with.",
