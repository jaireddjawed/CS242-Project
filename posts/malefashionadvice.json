The pocket square is the same as in outfit three.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy thoughts:\n\nFirst of all, I loved wearing ties. I can't really point down what made me love this experience, I guess it is the extra level of style you gain by wearing one. It elevates an outfit to the point that the same outfit, without a tie, just seems more \"boring\". One aspect I felt myself drawn towards was the knitted tie, altought I have half a dozen slik ties in my wardrobe, I always feel like a knitted tie is much better and easier to wear. This can be explained by the fact that a knitted tie is more casual than a slik tie and still gives your outfit an extra push. Given that society today leans way more into the casual side it is logical that a knitted tie is easier to wear. It were also these ties that got the most compliments, the texture does add a lot of detail despite the plain colour.\n\nI will admit this: it is difficult to start wearing ties. The fear of social norms\/confrontations by your peers is ever present (at least for me). However, taking on the sartorial (or any style) journey will require you to face remarks. I found that the vast majority of the time people meant any comment as a compliment and I am willing to bet that this will for anyone be the case. In truth, the only rule is this: wear what feels good to you and all will be well.\n\nThere is one small misconception I want to destroy: never once did a tie feel uncomfortable. I guess that this stems from people who wore ties when they were a requirement and wore a shirt that was too small around the collar. \n\nI will close with a piece of advice that helped me to start wearing ties: Adding a tie to your outfit immediately puts you apart from the crowd, especially nowadays. I started by wearing outfits like number four (the tie covered by a V-neck sweater). It allows you to grow more comfortable with a tie without it being a large and eyedrawing element of your outfit. It will also give you to illusion that no one will notice that you are wearing a tie, which can help you a lot to take the large step that is neckwear.\n\nAll in all, I will continue wearing ties, they are a beautiful piece that can truly elevate your outfit and make you feel stylish. I would love to hear what your opinion on ties in general or my (admittedly not very good) outfits is.","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1678640967.0},{"title":"Alternative to Eton Shirts but more trendy \/ younger target market?","author":"dolpherx","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/malefashionadvice\/comments\/11qjlic\/alternative_to_eton_shirts_but_more_trendy\/","text":"I love love love love Eton Shirts and I have been wearing it for 5+ years. When you open my closet it is basically all Eton Shirts, from the 5-10 white shirts for work and then all the patterned shirts for parties.\n\nBut maybe due to covid or a change in direction, they have stopped making their special patterned shirts that would normally headline their season. Now all their patterned shirts seems like it had a different artist \/ designer, and none of it headlines their releases anymore, because its just not at the same quality as before. I have emailed them to see what is going on, and their response have been that they are not doing it similarly like before, perhaps they do not have as much sales for these types of shirts, but they usually sell out every year though, and they are priced higher than the regular white shirts.\n\nOr maybe they no longer prefer to target the younger men category which is probably around 25-40. Most of the time Eton shirts are being sold on higher end men's stores where the target age group is 40+, you can tell by the sizes and cut available. It is often a challenge to buy in person Eton shirts, because the lack of sizes, cut, and design available. Usually the local stores in my city have bigger sizes and cuts available, and mostly only solid colors, and if they have patterns, its very basic patterns.\n\nSo I was just wondering if anyone has another brand that is similar in quality and has great patterns. I do not mind paying more, but design and comfort is really important to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks,","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678736980.0},{"title":"Recent Purchases - 12 March 2023","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/malefashionadvice\/comments\/11phzu2\/recent_purchases_12_march_2023\/","text":"This thread is for sharing all your new buys.

I'm going to be honest: I do well for myself, and I can't justify Drake's prices. The lookbook is absolutely amazing though, and the more I studied it the more I realized I can recreate most of the fits there from my wardrobe or from thrifting for a much lower price. That led to an idea, and I've been stalking and DMing people for a few days now to get feedback.\n\nThe goal is simple: Find a fit you like from Drake's, and recreate it. It can be from any lookbook or article on the Drake's page, any year is fine. The only hard and fast rule is your final fit can't involve any articles from Drake's itself. Don't get hung up thinking you have to make a 1:1 perfect copy of the fit, just do it in anyway that a reasonable person would see the close similarities between your fit and the original if placed side by side. I have two additional suggestions but these aren't hard and fast rules. First, don't feel like you have to spend a lot of money, this is supposed to be fun and creative, no one is competing and trying to outspend anyone else. Second suggestion is if you have to buy something to complete a fit, please consider buying used. Many of the Drake's pieces are beautiful but they are derivative\/inspired by vintage pieces and styles you can get for much, much cheaper on eBay. And most of the time the vintage pieces will be well constructed too. While I was doing my preliminary research I was able to find replacements for almost every Drake's sport coat on eBay and in my size for less than $150. \n\nHow will this work? I want to make this as stress free as possible for everyone so I'm setting a time limit of 30 days. If you want to participate,  post saying so in this thread. Then go through and find any fit you like, send me a link to what you've picked and then recreate it and send me a pic. I'll organize and post an album with everyone's submissions on April 08, and we can discuss the results. I figure 30 days is a reasonable time, that gives two weeks to pic a fit and buy what you need (if anything) and two weeks to get things tailored (again, if needed). I'm sure everyone can do it much faster than that but I want this to be as relaxed and stress free as possible. \n\nRegarding the possibility of people picking duplicate fits: I personally don't have a problem with it. There's such a plethora of material to choose from that I'm sure duplicates will be rare and even if it happens I think it will be interesting to see people put they're on take on a fit. However if two people do pick the same fit I will message them and let them know just in case they want to change it.\n\nPlease comment below if you want to to join or even if you have any feedback or advice!\n\nEdit: Just wanted to say thank you to everyone that's signing up, and I can't wait to see what everyone comes up!","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1678312195.0},{"title":"Top of WAYWT - February 2023","author":"TheFlavorOfLife","url":"https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/Iwr9eVF","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1678318124.0},{"title":"Uniqlo JW Anderson 2023 SS","author":"DuncanH97","url":"https:\/\/www.uniqlo.com\/jp\/ja\/contents\/collaboration\/jwanderson\/23ss\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1678270768.0},{"title":"Inside the Early Days of J.Crew: Before Jenna Lyons or Olympia Gayot, There Was Emily Cinader","author":"ac106","url":"https:\/\/www.vanityfair.com\/style\/2023\/03\/the-early-days-of-jcrew","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1678278660.0},{"title":"WAYWT - 8 March 2023","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/malefashionadvice\/comments\/11m1mjg\/waywt_8_march_2023\/","text":"WAYWT = What Are You Wearing Today (or a different day, whatever).\n\nThink of this as your chance to share your outfits with the community.

Here are some purchases I made and my take on them\n\n1. Rhone: It\u2019s cotton as per their website and the colors are fine. But I don\u2019t think they are premium quality at all. The fit was ok nothing amazing about it. The price point is high $50+ so I\u2019d expect a lot more. Wouldn\u2019t recommend it. Overall rating 1\/5.\n\n2. BYLT: So, I bought their Lux collection thinking it\u2019d be soft and feel like luxury. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s Pima cotton. Colors are nice. It fit tight. But they come at a reasonable price: $24-$32. And you can grab them on sale. It\u2019s ok. My overall rating would be 3\/5 because of its price not because of its overall feel.\n\n3. Cuts Clothing: ordered a few. Liked the overall look and feel of tshirts. Made in China. So be aware if you\u2019re someone who don\u2019t want Chinese made clothing. Their feel is similar to that of lululemon. But they run long. I am 5\u20196, medium built ordered medium and it was long. A lot of other reviews also said so. If you\u2019re tall you might like it. But they are also priced premium $60ish. Overall rating 3\/5 because of color options available and the soft touch of tshirt. It fits snuggy. \n\nLululemon: this was clearly the best overall tshirt of the lot. Premium feel, buttery smooth touch. Great colors and fit. They\u2019re also priced premium $60+. But they had a couple of issues - 1. One tshirt started bleeding color on the first wash. It just turned me off. 2. The other tshirt had this threads bump coming out on the body of the tshirt. Ended up returning them both. But they had the best overall build quality and premium feel. 3\/5 because of quality issues. If they fix it I\u2019ll try them again.\n\nFuture tries:\n\n1.

I have a long torso relative to my general build so finding a good fit of shirts and t-shirts has always been a challenge. \n\nPreviously I loved using Thread.com because they collated seemingly hundreds of different brands in one place and gave good info on the specific measurements of how they all fit; particularly useful to know t-shirt length in my case. Also, you could send the items back free of charge if they didn't fit well.\n\nThread have since gone out of business and I am struggling to buy clothes again.\n\nThe try & send back model only seems to be replicated by StitchFix but they charge regular \u00a310 fees just to present you with some clothes that you *might* like.\n\nAlso, I find most high street brands are either poor quality or, when they have higher quality materials, the fit is too tight \/ short; likely targeted at younger people than me.\n\nThere are online brands like Spoke and True Classic which focus on fit but seem to forget design at the same time.\n\nI have a couple of brands I discovered on thread that I keep an eye on (Percival, only & sons, Gant, clean cut Copenhagen, kin) but I'd LOVE to have a single place to scroll and buy from again.\n\nHas anyone found a similar online store which holds lots of different medium quality brands (not m&s, not Gucci; more like Percival) which look\/feel premium and fit well on tall but neither fat nor skinny people?

Joggers and athleisure items are always too warm to wear in summer. Sweaters make me look like a corporate dad-type, while sweatshirts look like pajamas, no matter how they fit.\n\nOuterwear for guys ranges from useless jackets to full-on winter coat, no in-between. These things certainly feel like accessories more than articles of clothing, considering they usually have that awful polyester lining and retain no heat.\n\nI'm a definite t-shirt and black jeans guy, and even then I'm frustrated. Most t shirts today are dismal and too thin to actually hold up for more than a year, regardless of price, and most jeans beyond excessively dark make my legs look wide and short. I can never make a Henley look good, the buttons never lay they way we all want them to. Same goes for OCBDs.\n\nBut I can't keep wearing mostly black, but dammit anything more feels excessive or gaudy. I wear 5 pieces of clothing: one black t shirt, two black jeans, and a revolving door of sweatshirts I don't want to wear, but have to because it's still cold outside. It's the most frustrating thing in the world because I *never* feel comfortable in anything with a hint of personality. I wonder what that says about me.\n\nTL;DR - Clothes feel awful nowadays and nothing speaks to me, to the point I can't even consider \"personal style\".","upvote_ratio":0.64,"created_utc":1677769328.0},{"title":"How do you find outlandish, garish, avant-garde, and fun outfits full of flair that scream \u201cLook at me\u201d?","author":"nopornthrowaways","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/malefashionadvice\/comments\/11f9fbe\/how_do_you_find_outlandish_garish_avantgarde_and\/","text":"When I was last in Miami, it turns out I had timed my vacation during Art Basel, some massive international art fair.

I used their sizing system and even emailed them immediately after ordering to see if they can leave some extra material to let it out for any future weight gain and even sent current measurements, particularly the hip around the butt, and they said they'd be sure to leave extra.\n\nI receive the suit and the slacks are maybe two sizes two small at least. I ordered a 36R which is what I usually wear and with my sending them information on my current measurements, they still managed to send the wrong size. I'm immediately emailed them explaining the issue and they said it would take 3 weeks to replace them as they would have to make some new ones. I explained that I needed this for a wedding by March 10th and they said there is no way they could get it to me in time. The person I have been communicating with through email about this has been slow to respond wasting precious extra days that they could potentially rush this out. The first return label link didn't work and they said I would have to send tracking in that day. They didn't get back to me until the next day. I even quoted the email or I gave them my current measurements which have not changed since I placed the order. I sent back the slacks today and come to find out the shipping label isn't even prepaid. I had to pay $25 to send it to them.\n\nThis has been the worst experience for a $400 suit, which I realize is not the most expensive and not the most I've ever spent on one, but it is important to me because this is for my friend's wedding. The customer service rep I've been communicating with doesn't even seems to have an appreciation for the situation or any empathy other than saying that they understand and are sorry. I requested they talk to their supervisor or manager about the situation and they just said the best they can do is maybe two weeks.\n\nSince they don't do refunds because they say everything is custom made, I'm going to dispute the charge with my credit card and hopefully one way or another they don't get paid for the suit. I could have gone to the men's wearhouse and got a good suit for $500.

It\u2019s a smart, sensible car and people are likely not going to clown you for driving one, in the same way people aren\u2019t really going to clown you for going to Old Navy because you need chinos for work and you know they make a pair that fits you well.\n\nAre the hobbyists here more like the people who would want to drive a [Bugatti Chiron](https:\/\/www.bugatti.com\/chiron\/)? I don\u2019t think so, unless it\u2019s the tiny, tiny percentage of this subreddit who have both the interest and the funds to buy couture or hyper high-end luxury. I think the hobbyists here fit far more into the person who buys a [GR Yaris](https:\/\/toyotagazooracing.com\/gr\/yaris\/). The car is still practicable (it even has back seats!) despite being a significant markup from the base model for a number of features only the hobbyist is going to really care about.\n\nOverall, this disconnect tends to come out in various ways here, but the most bitter spats cover either areas where there may be some amount of crossover between utilitarians and hobbyists, but the post represents something that may be a bridge too far for the utilitarians. KJ\u2019s post was a bit of an inflection point for this: someone who clearly treats clothes as a hobby, rather than a means to an end, which appeared to strike a chord with a number of users that found it apparently incomprehensible that someone with a clothing hobby would be consistently buying clothing.\n\nWhether it\u2019s willful or unintentional negligence, this leads to an dd disconnect, which may have something to do with how integral clothing is to everyday life. Someone might think \u201cwhy would I even want to think for more than 5 minutes about what I want to buy\/wear\/look like.\u201d However, this really only seems to apply in my experience to clothes as a hobby, whereas people seem to understand esotericism in hobbies like cars, building PCs, or alcohol.

Here are the sites\/platforms I took a break from:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Secondhand resale platforms**: Grailed, eBay, Yahoo Japan Auctions, Mercari, TRR\n* **Online fashion communities:** Discord, Reddit, Styleforum\n* **Social media platforms:** Instagram\n\nThat is not to say that I completely threw appreciating clothes to the wayside. I\u2019m fortunate to still live in LA and give myself opportunities to window shop and talk to the SAs at my favorite store\/flea markets. It feels so much better to nerd about the new stock and observe what other people are wearing IRL. These continue to be reliable sources of inspiration for me. Another thing I took up to doing is that if I spent any time on the online fashion communities, it was for the sole purpose of giving constructive feedback to other users.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Lesson 2: you will come to understand what comprises your core wardrobe**\n\nFashion marketers were onto something when they were shoving the \u201ccapsule wardrobe\u201d down our throats years ago. I personally find it hard to define my capsule wardrobe because I value eclecticism, so I\u2019ll revise that phrase by saying that **every person\u2019s wardrobe has its layers**. Here are some questions I asked myself when I started taking stock of what I owned:\n\n* **Core: easiest to style, recognizable, and most comfortable to wear pieces**\n   * Looking at my wardrobe, what are the easiest pieces to style?\n   * What are my signature pieces that I feel most comfortable in?\n* **Middle: takes some effort to style, but generally aligned to the wardrobe**\n   * What pieces can only be paired with certain aesthetics\/color palettes? Alternatively, am I only wearing this piece in a certain combination?\n* **Surface: tough-to-style, statement, or incongruous pieces to everything else**\n   * What pieces can be hard to style with others without sacrificing cohesion?\n\nI\u2019d probably define my style as the relaxed americana bastard that took[ joseph\u2019s amazing technicolor dreamcoat](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xp4Fym1KImY) literally. My core wardrobe consists of Nepenthes family brands (AiE, Engineered Garments, and Needles), Workwear\/Americana adjacent brands (Bode, Man-tle, S.K. Manor Hill, Story MFG), and Japanese brands (Kapital, Unused, Uru).\n\nAnything new that I planned on purchasing **has** to fit within this vocabulary because I want to wear it with as many combinations as possible without sacrificing cohesion. Two things happened as a result: I wore alot more of everything I owned and I also started selling my \u201csurface\u201d pieces. I personally don\u2019t believe in keeping an archive of \u201cgrails\u201d that I no longer wear, I\u2019m happy to pass that along at a reasonable price to someone else who wants to enjoy them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Lesson 3: it\u2019s nice to have nice things, but don\u2019t let that get in the way of finding your own definition of prosperity**\n\nI think the general public sees fashion as frivolous because over-consumption of clothes can make it seem like a blood sport. I\u2019m guilty of this because 2017, 2018, 2021, and 2022 felt like years of over-consumption of clothes. In defense of the early years, the online fashion space felt very different because there was no Tik Tok and it still seemed like people wanted to experiment for the sake of learning more about themselves through clothes. Today, my curiosity continues to be piqued by new designers (though keeping up through consumption and sharing fit pics feels less of a priority).\n\nOnce I reflected on the journey, I undertook an exercise of redefining daily \u201cprosperity\u201d and those days had nothing to do with buying clothes. My best days being unemployed were ones where I rode my motorcycle, saw a friend for a coffee, went to dance classes, or had a tiring workout before I cooked myself a nice dinner. Though I\u2019m more introverted now than I was when I was employed, the slow pace of living has allowed me to recharge from years of accumulated burnout in the tech industry, and I had less decision fatigue from thinking about what I needed to kop from my SSENSE wishlist.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Lesson 4: being a passive follower doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t still enjoy it**\n\nAs previously mentioned, what you take from your journey stays with you and the hobby intrinsically becomes a [part of you](https:\/\/alittlebitofrest.com\/2022\/11\/28\/menswear-is-my-hobby\/#more-44855). You can continue to participate and as an older fart in this community, we need more personable people who can inspire others to find joy in this medium of expression. I think get-ready-with-me content is very played out (happy for them though) and is partly to blame for the lack we feel when we look at our wardrobes. There\u2019s too much showpersonship and the over-saturation of micro-trends (in my opinion) has created a less-discerning average fashion enthusiast. As an eternal optimist, I envision a world of more enthusiasts who are content with what they have and are intentional about sourcing their clothes in a sustainable way. I sincerely hope that we see a counter-trend of contentedness surfaces as time goes on.\n\nThrough alot of personal reflection, I surprised myself by going down a content hole and finding some great channels\/sites that share great analysis on the macro-trends and community as a whole. This kind of self-awareness is great and they\u2019re worth checking out:\n\n* [Antwon](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=JsCHzuw4XTo)\n* [Fashion Elitist](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UC9EJcp4ppeqKET1f_Z0S8Tw)\n* [Fashionlover4](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@fashionlover4)\n* [Frugal Aesthetic](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@FrugalAesthetic\/videos)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Takeaways and goodbye**\n\nTaking this all into consideration, I became a more mindful consumer and ended up being alot more content with what I had by reducing my fashion media consumption, identifying the core pieces of my wardrobe, redefining prosperity (without having to consume), and finding alternative ways to participate in the discourse that bring positivity to others. At the time of this publishing, I broke the seal and made my first purchase of the year, but I\u2019m excited to continue this four-item limit until the end of the year and hope to expand on what I learned then.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my words! Please remember that these are my own thoughts on the matter and disagreements are totally cool. I\u2019d love to hear other people\u2019s reflections if they\u2019re doing something similar and look forward to our discussions.

For what they were and how much Levi\u2019s normally are around where I am, it seemed like a pretty good deal. The reason why I needed to spend that much though is because of my absolute tree trunk legs I got from lifting that makes finding a good pair of jeans from anywhere a living hell. I needed quality and found some pretty good ones that fit me just nicely.\n\nAlthough, due to how much I spent, I don\u2019t want to treat these jeans how I\u2019ve treated my other pair of jeans, which normally would be me just throwing them in the washer and dryer with all my other clothes almost every week and not look back. I\u2019m looking at these as more of an investment than something I just have.\n\nSince I got them, I\u2019ve been looking through the internet on how to treat your jeans and basically what I have learned is:\n\n1. almost never wash them unless you really have to \n2. if you do, turn them instead out and wash them alone in cold water with a not so rough spin cycle\n3. After wash, hang dry them and if you can\u2019t, put them in the dryer with low heat and tumble dry.\n\nI already did this process before my first wear and hung them out in the closet. I try not to wear jeans throughout the week and just opt to wearing gym shorts or joggers, so primarily jeans are a weekend wear.
