        "text": "\n\nWell that was fast. \n\nIn [my write up on the first episode](https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/119az26/checked_out_of_star_trek_season_3_episode_1_of/) I was borderline avuncular on a dramatic increase in quality over anything else I‚Äôd seen in Nu Trek. And I stand by that positive response. I also posited that the pattern with Nu Trek is that the start of any given season is as good as it gets- and everything just declines from there as the incompetencies of the writers start to pile up on each other creating contradictions, aborted plot lines, and nonsensical character choices, culminating in something unwatchable to anyone with an attention span longer than a YouTube advert- and expectations greater than ‚ÄúFEEEEEELS‚Äù!\n\nWell that process has already begun with episode 2 starting the major contradictions. I described the errors in episode 1 as ‚Äòdent on the bodywork rather than a broken axle‚Äô, well now that axle is creaking ominously. In episode 1 I was initially confused by everyone taking orders from Picard when he‚Äôs supposed to be a *retired* admiral. But once Captain Shaw put his foot down and refused orders from him on the basis that he was retired I just accepted that he was being shown respect rather than having any legitimate authority. Like, if Picard wants to conduct an inspection on a ship he‚Äôs not harming anyone. Hell, it might be a morale boost for the crew to have a living legend on board. But the moment he tries to do something meaningful Shaw (rightly) shuts him down. \n\nSo the show has established something. Picard is a retired admiral and has no authority beyond what courtesy active officers give him. Cool. Noted. Episode 2 ends with him giving orders contrary to Captain Shaw who responds with words to the effect of ‚Äúwhy are you doing this‚Äù, with no effort to belay Picard‚Äôs (unlawful) instructions. So we have our first major contradiction. It also throws my previous ‚ÄòPicard is being shown courtesy‚Äô headcannon into disrepute- it now seems far more likely the writers just didn‚Äôt know if Picard had authority or not. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a conflicting element of multiple drafts but I think to Nu Trek writers redrafting means something to do with the Vietnam war.\n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what rank I do or don‚Äôt have I need a tactical team now!‚Äù\n\nNo Seven. No. That‚Äôs not how the chain of command works. When you are relieved of duty it‚Äôs because your superior doesn‚Äôt think you‚Äôre up to the job. It means your orders are now unlawful and you have no authority to give anyone instructions- least of all squads of armed soldiers. I just can‚Äôt get over this and it‚Äôs quintessential Nu Trek writing. They don‚Äôt understand how military and military derived organizations work. Rank, authority and chain of command exist for a reason. Part of that reason is so that people whose fitness is suspect don‚Äôt have the authority to give potentially equally suspect orders to say‚Ä¶ squads of armed troops who may need to kill someone. I know I keep hitting that point home, but it‚Äôs one thing if, say,  Seven demands a tech to fix her replicator while she‚Äôs relieved of duty- it‚Äôs another to be giving potentially life and death orders.\n\nSo we‚Äôre two episodes in and command authority is now meaningless. Retired officers can give lawful orders but they can‚Äôt, and officers relieved of duty can still give orders *if they reaaaaaly mean it*. At this point I‚Äôm waiting for an ensign to become first officer just because they‚Äôre popular. Wouldn‚Äôt that be stupid eh?\n\nThe biggest disappointment is Raffi. After getting me totally on board with the character in episode 1, episode 2 sent me right back to hating her. Every single bloody scene she‚Äôs in starts with her delivering a recap. Even if she‚Äôs recapping events to someone already aware of those events. The dialogue is back to those weird, Lucas-esque declamations. On one occasion I got the impression that she was trying to get stuff straight in her own head- which is fine given Raffi is not the most stable and lucid of people. But as I was watching I thought ‚Äòthey need some quick cuts and discontinuous edits here to emphasise mania‚Äô. Then at the very end of her recap they do just that. Once. You‚Äôve seen the ‚Äòjarring edits to convey madness‚Äô trope before (Arcane is a recent example), but the fact they only did a single discontinuous edit leads me to suspect the editor isn‚Äôt even aware of the trope and just happened to make a mistake in a place where the mistake works in favour of the show.\n\nPatrick Stewart is too old to do this. It‚Äôs harsh. It‚Äôs moderately insulting. But it‚Äôs true. He can‚Äôt even deliver his lines well while sitting down. It‚Äôs now past the point of him playing an older version of the character and well into the realms of- not to put to fine a point on it- physical incapability. I feel like a complete shit for saying it. But when he‚Äôs making painful rasps on the occasional syllable even while sitting down it‚Äôs embarrassing to watch. It‚Äôs like watching someone with a foot injury run a race. It may be impressive that they‚Äôre trying but at the end of the day‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs a slot that could have gone to someone who could actually be part of the competition. Maybe Stewart is just that good of an actor, but then the criticisms just transfer to the character. However you shape it- man or myth- this is not a character that should be out having adventures. \n\nOur villain is‚Ä¶ well there‚Äôs potential there. Sort of. If the performance was a little less goofy Vadic might actually be threatening. Make her warbling voice a little more steady with greater variation only at emotional peaks and you‚Äôd have the impression of someone cracked but able to hold herself together anyway. Someone a little more in the vein of Ricardo Montablanc‚Äôs take on Khan. As it stands I just see Frau Farbissna. For around 10% of the time she‚Äôs threatening. For the remaining 90% she‚Äôs just try hard. Also the writers seem to have an incredibly twisted (read, ‚Äòwrong‚Äô) view on what a Shrike is. For starters it‚Äôs not a carrion bird, it‚Äôs a predator. Famously so. Also there‚Äôs nothing threatening about comparing your ship to a carrion bird. Oh your ship is so pathetic it can only scavenge what something else killed? Reaaaaaaly browning my trousers over here. Bra-fucking-vo. Wait did they confuse the words carrion and carnivore? Nah they can‚Äôt be that incompetent surely. Right? RIGHT!?\n\nThe loggerhead Shrike is best known for two things. First it‚Äôs a passerine predatory carnivore. Passerine as in robins, tits, those sorts of small songbirds* you often see at the bird feeder. Predatory carnivore as in‚Ä¶ well a meat eater and hunter. Second it ‚Äòstores‚Äô its kills by skewering them on thorns or in some cases- barbed wire. As the bird is quite weak, in many cases this is also how it actually kills its prey.  So appropriately contextualised it‚Äôs a pretty good name for a small, but dangerous warship.\n*I apologise to all the twitchers and ornithologists for this flagrant colloquialism. \n\nBut when Vadic attempts to make a threat out of the name it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ wrong. She implies that the ship will ‚Äòpeck‚Äô them to death, destroying them system by system. She makes no mention of the ‚ÄòButcher bird‚Äôs most well known and threatening trait- picking its prey up and skewering it on something sharp. I can see where they are going but it‚Äôs just not right. To anyone familiar with the Shrike the description is weird. To anyone else the threat works without the comparison. So why bother bringing the ship‚Äôs name into the threat? And if you‚Äôre going to- why make such a weird description of the Shrike, especially calling it a carrion bird?\n\nShaw has two reasons to not mess with Vadic- his ship is an explorer and not heavily gunned (hers is armed to the teeth) ‚Äì and he has a crew of 500 people. So far, so good. Shaw doesn‚Äôt want to lead 500 people to their deaths in a fight they can‚Äôt win. Perfect motivation for a Starfleet officer. I didn‚Äôt need to be reminded of that every time he refuses to confront the villain. It‚Äôs a small thing but like Raffi‚Äôs recaps it leads to highly artificial speech and a patronizing experience for anyone who can remember what a character said about their motivations 20 minutes ago. Play it as a conversational trump card or leave it out. Don‚Äôt do this weird half in half out thing where it sounds like Shaw is explaining it for the first time- again.\n\nLike a lot of Nu Trek if you leave your brain at the door there‚Äôs certainly enjoyment to be had. But think about that. You have to switch off your brain to enjoy Star Trek. For the people who keep asking ‚ÄúWhy do people hate Nu Trek?‚Äù (and then promptly vanish when given legitimate reasons unrelated to ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs woke‚Äô) there‚Äôs the issue in a nut shell. What was an intelligently written, often challenging show now actively requires suppression of thought instead of promoting thought. With episode 2, Picard season 3 now appears to be hurtling down that same track, squandering almost all the good will episode 1 created. If Episode 3 isn‚Äôt a banger then I‚Äôm out. As I said in my previous review on episode 1 the pattern is always that episode quality declines over each season, and I‚Äôm not going to be suckered into wasting my time on crap. The only reason I‚Äôm giving episode 3 a chance is because I‚Äôm worried that I‚Äôm only letting myself see what I expect to see and that I‚Äôm losing objectivity. But my self doubt will only carry Picard so far.",

        "text": "CHAPTER 1: life among the Ataperry\n\n(Ataperry is from the twentieth-century English root \"Auto repairmen\").\n\nPlace: a forest in the mountains of the westernmost province of the Denver kingdom, officially Colorado's capital. Near the border with the Deseret federation.\n\nYear: 2104.\n\nJamisi turned the start-crank on his truck, and his old rusty vehicle roared to life and began barreling down the old decaying county road. he checked his mirror and noticed that the old plastic cables they had just bought must have been rotted, as the Jugs of corn whiskey used as fuel were tumbling about the bed. \"Hey, Bruth!\" he shouted. \"Retie the buck'a corn fuel in the bed!\" Jamisi's younger brother Torrence, who was riding shotgun, set his rifle below his seat and signaled for the women sitting in the back to move. Jamisi stuck his arm out the window and gave the hand signal for the rest of the clan caravan to slow down. Torrence pushed aside the curtain and nimbly climbed out the truck's back window. His older sister Mary handed him the coil of juniper rope that she and Jamisi's new wife Masina had just finished making. The boy then began tying down the dozen or so fallen-over ten-gallon jugs of fuel lying in the back. He grunted loudly as the torrent of rain hit his face. Then paused to tighten the straps on his elk skin clothing and bent down to finish his task. Finally, he leaped back through the window, grabbed his rifle, and sat back down on the passenger seat next to his brother. May, Torrence's twin sister, handed him a rag, and he wiped the rain and sleet out of his hair and off his clothes. Jamisi signaled for the caravan to speed up, and the group of trucks, vans, and trailers sped down the bumpy old road.  May, the only person in the vehicle who could read, started reading Genesis from her king James Bible out loud to the other passengers. Torrence nodded off, and when he awoke, the convoy had pulled to a stop. They had arrived at Dillen Lake. Torrence looked around; they were surrounded by the old ruins of what had once been the town of Fresco. The old town buildings had rusted away and were no longer livable, so the remaining people mostly lived in the small village of log cabins on a small island in the middle of the lake or nearby farmsteads. They often came here because the local community allowed the Ataperry clan to scavenge through the ruins in exchange for a discounted price of labor and trade. Now they would only spend a few days before moving on to Denver. Torrence felt a twinge of sadness, knowing that soon, he probably wouldn't be able to see any of the places he had grown up seeing. He had grown up traveling thousands of miles yearly, going from city to city repairing motors and vehicles in exchange for food and provisions and working in factories and farms. Moter repair had always been the family's preferred trade ever since they began traveling one hundred years ago. But nowadays, there was little business since the corporations had mostly vanished, and no one was selling gasoline anymore.\n\nFor decades the complex market-based economy of the settled world had been slowly fading. Thanks to most settled people choosing to grow old without children, America followed Europe and Asia into their slow withdrawal from the world. It was thought this crisis could be remedied with immigration; however, the same cultural forces were in play throughout Latin America, and the pool of willing immigrants eventually dried up. Nevertheless, the collapse had recently begun to slow as high birth-rate groups, such as the itinerant clans that wandered around searching for work, and religious minorities such as Mormons, Muslims, and especially the Amish, with their fivefold fertility advantage, were quickly becoming the majority of the population.\n\nThe old fading civilization had finally given up five years ago when Torrence was seven years old. A large solar flare, Akin to the Harrington event, had struck the earth. Destroying most electronics. This was not nearly as devastating in America as it would have been decades before. Much of the countryside was empty of people, and the internet, with its productivity-destroying powers, was already taboo for most of the population. The massive population of elderly died en mass. And millions of younger people franticly fled the already depopulated cities in search of farmland.\n\nThe Ataperry had attempted to continue their old lifestyle, scavenging through the cities and fixing tractors and cars in exchange for homemade ethanol which was now the only available fuel. But now, parts were difficult to find, and most people were farming the land by hand as their ancestors had once done. Horses were already prevalent among the rural villagers and nomadic people long before the solar flare, although the Ataperry prided themselves on their trucks. Torrence's community had decided that their best option was to either settle down and farm, survive through raiding, or give up their vehicles and move about on horseback, surviving off of the wilderness or herding cattle, sheep, or goats. After several years of trying to preserve their way of life and arguing about the best alternative, they finally decided on shepherding. They knew that in the Rockies there were many herds of wild horses, and large flocks of semi-wild sheep could be easily stolen from the King of Denver.\n\nTorrence opened the door and stepped out of the truck. He yawned and stretched, relieved to no longer be sitting in the stuffy truck. His sister May stepped out after him. \"Hey Tor, you think that's a good spot for a fire?\" she pointed at a large pothole in the old overgrown parking lot. \"Looks good to me,\" he said. \"Should I start a fire here?\" May shouted. \"Go ahead,\" their father called back as he backed his trailer into a nearby corner of the lot...\n\nI need to write more.

I've very recently really gotten into short story sci fi after reading several anthologies by Ray Bradbury, Robert Sheckley, Ted Chiang, etc. etc. I've been wanting to read more but  so I thought, Why not try a magazine?! Unfortunately there are infinite options all of which look amazing. Any recommendations for favorites? I'm especially looking for one that publishes authors from diverse backgrounds. Thanks!",

        "text": "I was just playing around with the popular AI chat bot ChatGPT and wanted it to help me come up with an idea for a sci-fi series. The bot actually gave me 5 possible ideas around which to plot the series, which in turn gave me an idea for a Sci-Fi series. And here's what we came up with...\n\nN.B.: what do you think about this bot-human cooperation and the concept?\n\n \n\nTitle: \"Chrono-Changers\"\n\nPremise: In a far-off dimension, a council of powerful beings known as the Chrono-Keepers has decided to intervene in human history. Their plan: to send entities from their dimension into human bodies at different time periods in order to influence the course of history.\n\nEach episode would focus on a different influential figure from human history, such as Julius Caesar, Leonardo da Vinci, or George Washington. However, unbeknownst to the rest of the world, these figures are not who they appear to be. They are actually vessels for the Chrono-Keepers, who have imbued them with their own unique powers, abilities, and moral compasses.\n\nSome of the Chrono-Keepers may choose to emulate the historical figures they inhabit, using their new influence to bring about positive change or further their own agendas. Others may struggle to adapt to their new bodies, conflicting with the true nature of the historical figures and risking their own survival.\n\nAs the series progresses, a larger story arc would emerge, revealing the true motivations of the Chrono-Keepers and the consequences of their meddling with human history. Along the way, viewers would be treated to a unique blend of sci-fi and historical drama, as they watch these powerful entities navigate the complexities of human life and influence the course of history.\n\nCast: The show would require a talented ensemble cast to bring its historical figures to life, as well as actors to portray the Chrono-Keepers in their own dimension. Guest stars could also appear as other historical figures who cross paths with the Chrono-Changers.\n\nOverall, \"Chrono-Changers\" would be an exciting and thought-provoking sci-fi series that blends time travel, historical drama, and ethical dilemmas into a captivating and unforgettable viewing experience.",
