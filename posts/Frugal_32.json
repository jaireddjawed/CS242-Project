        "text": "Just wondering how you handle these situations.\n\nLast year, I spent $400 on an RC plane. I spent a lot of time doing the research before purchase, and Im sure this plane is quite good for beginners.\n\nBuilding it was sorta fun and I eventually brought it outside, only for it to crash within 10 min. I did eventually recover it from a tree however since then I have developed PTSD with regards to flying RC plane and I havnt used it since and am not sure I want to again.\n\nSo $400 for a few hours and a tramatic situation. I guess this was somewhat of a learning experience and there was a huge rush of adrenaline when I was flying this. \n\nSo does anyone else have these situations happen to them, spending a lot on something, only for it to have little use. Can you share your story.",

        "text": "I live in Central Ohio and the Kroger by me has stick butter on sale with a weekly sale coupon for 3.49 when the regular price is 4.99. You can use the coupon up to 5 times. I wasn't planning on getting butter this week, but I'm nabbing two to freeze because I haven't seen butter on sale for quite a few months. I sucked it up last month and bought a full priced box at aldi. I still have most of that box, but the good thing about butter is it freezes great. It's not the best sale because they used to have sales for 2.49 regularly, but considering the price hike recently along with no sales for a few months it's not a bad deal for the current market. Got to work with what we're given. I don't use butter much except for baking and minimal for cooking, so that will easily last my fiance and I 5 or 6 months. \n\nThey also have coupons for 4 times fuel points and for Friday only they have a 500 extra fuel point on top of the 4 times coupon that all you have to do is clip and get more than $35. I don't shop for fuel points alone, but it just so happens to be my grocery week and why not get $0.50 extra off gas just for my normal order that I was going to do anyway. Last month I only got $220 in groceries over two orders from Kroger (I got $80 from aldi too), but I got 1353 ($1.35) off in gas just by clipping their bonus coupons. One dollar equals one point, so I should have only had $0.20 off. I work from home, have a car with a small gas tank, and I don't use much gas since I don't drive much anymore, but my fiance commutes everyday and also drives to his parents house 2 hours away frequently, so he happily uses the discount.",

I've gone through a presentation in my area a couple years ago with hilton for a voucher but never used it unfortunately. I stumbled upon this site: [https://timesharepresentationdeals.com/optin](https://timesharepresentationdeals.com/optin)\n\nAnd I really don't know what to make of it! has anyone done a deal with this company? I'm more interested in finding deals for mexico or carribean but those are rare these days lol. Any general tips or suggestions appreciated!",

My home has been very expensive this year, so I don't have the budget for anything of that sort. \n\nI'm in zone 7a/6b for reference.

        "text": "So my cousin is in a big Dave Ramsey kick recently. And means well and want to make her life better. But she’s going real hard with that “first baby step is just save $1000!” And not really focusing on starting on the things this group revolves around. I personally think Ramsey is a bully and clueless or doesn’t care about most people on a basic level. I’ve seen enough of him to not trust or enjoy him, even his math sloth of times.   He also focuses on people who clearly have enough money, but just don’t know know quite what to do with it. Not a “normal” person who will never be able to make the math for reasonable, modest life work without a substantial growth in income or getting more for what they pay for. My cousin and I are poor as you can be without being homeless or starving THIS MONTH. Not stable enough to save AND have a place to live. Maybe eat cheaper, but it’s already at the point where any less would just be unhealthy in lack quality or quantity. \n\nSo at what point do I start seeing a push for more gov action to help everyone to save on their biggest expenses and not make us just save to crumbs. Budgeting and saving or repurposejng things or finding a cheaper, sufficient way is still good. I don’t mean to take from anything we have all shared here as it still has its place. But we can’t save $1000 of money we paid in to taxes of a business. Everything feels like a deal when it’s cheaper or better quality at the same price. Why haven’t I seen this group talk about community support and gov systems that would actually help. It’s great you learned to see a patch on your shirt and I’m proud of you. But you just got an overpriced medical bill for $1000 plus, with little service that realistically made that not matter in the long run. Taxes only feel like theft when you don’t get what you payed for or better, just like any other thing you buy. Arguably. That would be the biggest help to most people.",

Minimum insurance coverage as a mid-20's male is $6.25/mo or $75/year. Replacement tires $40 each. 1qt oil is about $12, and this only takes .7 qt per change, with no filter to be replaced. According to Fuelly these average 99mpg with regular gasoline, but I have heard of people getting 130+ mpg. Honda relibility, I see these from the 80's still kickin'.\n\nThese top out at about 55mph. Luckily, I live in a mid-sized city and don't need much highway capability. \n\nObviously, this won't be suitable for winter use. But other than that, when it comes to saving money &amp; reducing emissions, I can't think of a better option other than maybe public transpo or bicycles/e-bikes, which have their own limitations. I believe this to be far better than an expensive EV as well. \n\nThanks &amp; any thoughts are appreciated!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zwnwpfuu0gba1.png?width=1125&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d073e93d22404566489f239c21d857052b75c718",

Move into a smaller place, negotiate, etc.\n\nThere are a lot of things on this sub that IMO mirror the former category. Don't get me wrong, I love those things.

We also had some work related issues which left us starting our emergency fund from scratch.\n\nWe’re doing well for ourselves with double incomes, but my partner is leaving their job next fall and we’ll be living off my income alone. Once my partner stops working, we’ll have around three or four months of emergency fund in place if all savings go towards that which is currently the main priority.\nMy income alone without ot will be enough for all the bills and maybe a few hundred in savings.\n\nAs I stated, my car is giving me trouble and within the last year, I’ve had some sort of power steering issue that I had to pay $700 to fix and now only about six months later I’m having a similar issue with the car that I’m sure will be $500+ to fix. I imagine this pattern will continue seeing how old the car is.\n\nI’m wondering if it’s even worth it to get the car fixed or to just start saving up for a used car in the near(ish) future. Fortunately, I have the option to mostly work from home and don’t have to commute to work everyday but recently I’ve found myself having to go into the office at least once a week which means I ride public transportation and commute for about an hour and a half one way compared to the half hour it takes driving myself.\n\nWould it be worth attempting to fix my old car at this point? Or should I just drop that money on the future car purchase?",
