A new Q&amp;A thread goes up every Monday, but we have people who read them regularly throughout the week.\n\n**What counts as a “quick question”?**\n\nAny question that can be answered in a single comment and is unlikely to generate discussion is a quick question. While it’s impossible to predict which questions will generate disscussion all of the time, here are some examples: \n\n*Quick questions:*\n\n* Asking for an explanation of a technical term\n* Asking if there are any languages with a particular feature\n* Asking how we would transcribe something\n* Asking how a feature works in a particular language\n\n*Not-so-quick questions:*\n\n* Asking about the theoretical or methodological motivation for a particular claim\n* Asking for reading recommendations for a particular subject\n\nIf you’re not sure where your question belongs, just use your best judgment. The mods might ask you to move your question—but if so, it’s no big deal, and has nothing to do with the quality of the question.\n\nAlso, before asking a question, please be sure to check [**our FAQ**](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/wiki/faqindex) and to do a quick Google or Wikipedia search. We’re happy to answer questions, but we appreciate it when people have tried to do some basic research first. You may also be interested in our [**reading list**](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/wiki/readinglist).\n\n**Commenting rules**\n\nThe rules for commenting in this post are the same as for the rest of /r/linguistics.

Please familiarize yourself with [**our commenting policy**](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/1u9xsr/reminder_of_the_rlinguistics_commenting_policy/) and [**our subreddit rules**](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/wiki/rules).\n\n**What if I didn't get an answer to my question last week?**\n\nYour question probably wasn’t answered because no one who knew the answer saw it. This could be because you posted it soon before the new Q&amp;A thread went up, or it could be because it the answer requires specialist knowledge.  If this happens, feel free to repost your question in the new Q&amp;A thread, or to post it as a separate thread.",

        "text": "I don't have a particular question, and this post is probably going to be all over the place, so if this doesn't suit the subreddit, do feel free to delete the post.\n\nI have recently become interested in phonology and phonetics after starting to learn Korean (no formal training in linguistics at all), but I am rather confused about aspiration and voicing in stops.\n\nMy native language is Danish, and apart from English I speak some German and a tiny bit of French. These languages all share some form of /p, t, k/ and /b, d, g/ phonemes, even though they distinguish between them in different ways, so let me just call the first group fortis and the second lenis.\n\nIn Danish, both groups are voiceless in syllable onset, and they are distinguished by aspiration.\n\nIn French, [\"Generally, /b, d, ɡ/ are voiced throughout and /p, t, k/ are unaspirated.\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_phonology#Consonants) So \nthey are evidently distinguished on the basis of voicing. [This page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirated_consonant#Absence) also explicitly notes the absence of voicing in French consonants. Furthermore, [this IPA guide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/French) for French compares the French /p/ to the English /p/ as realised in the word *spy*, which is unaspirated. However, unless I don't know what it means for a stop to be aspirated, the stops are in fact aspirated in the words [*pou*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pou#French), [*tout*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tout#French) and [*cou*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cou#French), despite them being listed as examples of the supposedly unaspirated fortis stops. In particular, they sound completely different from and distinctly more aspirated than the above English /p/ in *spy*.\n\nIn English, different Wikipedia articles seem to say different things. [This page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirated_consonant#Allophonic) claims that \"stops are distinguished primarily by voicing\", while [this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_(phonetics\\)#In_English) states that \"consonant phonemes are classified as either voiced or voiceless even though it is not the primary distinctive feature between them\". Of course, this does not mean that *aspiration* is a distinctive feature, but it does seem to be inconsistent with the above claim. I should note for completeness that aspiration is in fact the way in which I personally distinguish between fortis and lenis stops in English, though that might just be because Danish does.\n\nSo I am quite confused, and I don't know what I am misunderstanding.",

I guess I'm a bit surprised. Y'see, I could've *sworn* that this usage was widespread. I'm having a very hard time accepting that other people don't use it...'cuz, erh, what else would you use *yo* for? Isn't that what it is? The gender neutral third person pronoun?\n\nHaha, I guess I just need y'all to confirm it and dispel my cognitive dissonance. Interestingly enough, for some reason in my mind, I was holding the misconception that this was largely a characteristic of African American speech -- but it just occurred to me that at no time in my life has this usage been delineated by race -- I myself am of Korean descent. *Yo* is mostly confined to young people, yeah, but I thought this was kinda the case everywhere, not just in Baltimore.\n\nOh, and another note: *yo* is often used in sentences with zero copula, but agrees with it/he/she in sentences where the copula is present. That is to say, *yo* can be contracted to *yo's.* It also has a unique effect on the prosody of sentences that I am not educated enough to describe; basically, it does NOT sound like \"you\" in the context of a conversation because it reduces the speed of the sentence.\n\nedit: the following are examples I have heard in real life, which is why they are so silly. They are NOT the second person possessive, which is also pronounced *yo*. Note: curse words do not carry their typical weight\n\n*Yo dumb. --&gt; He is dumb.*\n\n*Yo shoes untied. --&gt; Her shoes are untied.*\n\n*Yo is fucking stupid*. --&gt; *They are very dumb (not vulgar).*\n\n*Yo walkin' on two dollars. --&gt; He just passed by two dollars; his shoes are cheap*\n\n*Fuck* *is yo doing? --&gt; What* *the heck is she doing?*\n\n*Yo don't even know how to calculate area. --&gt; He doesn't even know how to calculate area.*\n\n*Yo's killin' it! --&gt; That's impressive!*\n\n*Yo ready catch hands. --&gt; He is about to be fought.*\n\n*Yo car ready get towed. --&gt; Their car might be towed.*\n\n*Yo empty.* \\--&gt; *That is completely empty.*\n\n*Yo cruddy. --&gt; They are petty.*\n\n\\--\n\n\\--\n\nIf you start mixing *yo* with other pronouns, it gets messy.\n\n*He don't have yo keys.* \\--&gt; *He does not have your keys.*\n\nvs.\n\n*Yo don't have his keys.* \\--&gt; *He does not have his own keys.*",

German has only a few grammatical endings that overlap considerable, like *-en* that can mean *infinitive/dative plural/weak noun plural/1p plural ind* Whereas Swedish still keeps the similar endings phonologically distinct.\n\nIf you look at the history the related languages danish or English where vowel reduction took place, there was a fairly rapid loss of case and verbal morphology since the endings were opaque and fairly meaningless, but for some reason this never happened in German. It is also noteworthy to mention the fairly large dialect area in northern Scandinavian that keeps dative to this day, but also shows much apocope and vowel loss, where the case is expressed using the article.",

Obviously though, since I've discovered linguistics, I've been pretty interested in finding out how I produce phones that would typically require the use of my tongue tip.\n\nFor most, it's pretty mundane. For dental or alveolar consonants that would usually require the use of the tongue tip, I just push the middle of my tongue up to touch the right place. But I'm still very confused as to how I produce vowels, especially front vowels. As I understand it, vowels are produced by having a certain part of your tongue at a certain position in your mouth, and front vowels require the tongue tip to be in different positions, something that isn't possible for me. And yet I can pronounce all fronted vowels in English (/i/, /ɪ/, /ɛ/, /æ/, and /a/), in a way that seems indistinguishable for speakers without my condition. So I'm totally stumped as to how I'm making those sounds. \n\nIf anyone could provide me with an explanation for this I'd be hugely grateful, as it'd satisfy a huge curiosity of mine (and in the process help me to better understand vowels, as I sure as hell don't think I understand them right now!).",

However, I am currently learning Russian which has no aspiration on stops and distinguishes them via voice (/d/ is [d] and /t/ is [t], etc.). For some reason though I can't seem to be able to remove the aspiration from my unvoiced stops in Russian. I always feel like my [k]'s end up sounding too close to a [g] for example so I end up aspirating to compensate. What's even weirder is that I *can* distinguish between voiced stops and unaspirated voiceless stops in Japanese (although admittedly voiceless stops are slightly aspirated in Japanese). If I put my hand in front of my mouth I feel no burst of air coming out when I say 時*toki* for example.

So, first off, sorry if I come off as not knowing what I'm talking about; I probably don't.\n\nIn my understanding of language and linguistic divergence, over a landmass as large as the Roman Empire, there must have been massive differences between the vulgar Latin spoken at one end compared to the vulgar Latin spoken at the other end. I also am not certain but can *presume* that because literary Latin was sufficiently different from vulgar Latin that these regional dialectical differences in vulgar Latin might have made it difficult to understand from one to another since it was, in some ways, a parallel tongue.\n\nI have a few questions for people more educated on this than me:\n\n1) Are there any proper sources for vulgar Latin at the regional level? Even if not, what sources are there on vulgar Latin that, say, a Wikipedia page about vulgar Latin may not credit?\n\n2) Do we know yet if regional differences and dialects had a measurable effect on the spoken tongue at, say, the height of the Roman Empire? Would a speaker of vulgar Latin from westernmost Rome be able to understand a speaker of vulgar Latin from easternmost Rome?\n\n3) Most of Rome's territorial winnings were earned through conquest; can we see in languages on the outskirts of the Roman Empire (e.g. the Assyrian and Mesopotamian regions) where these languages/cultures interacted with and were affected by Latin/Roman domination?\n\nFeel free to answer any or none of my questions and make corrections to my suppositions at the start.

Compare Middle French *creatif*, French *créatif* (15th cent.), Spanish *creativo* (15th cent.), Italian *creativo* (15th cent.)\n\nFrom that I created the topic sentence for the history paragraph:\n\n*Creative* was frequently borrowed from Latin *creativus* in the twelfth century and established itself in English during the fourteenth century (OED 2018).\n\nI was satisfied with this until checking Merriam-Webster’s and Online Etymology’s version of events out of curiosity, which are:\n\n* **Merriam-Webster:** First Known Use—1678 …\n\n* **Online Etymology:** [First Known Use]—1670s …\n\nI’m new to this and wholly confused.\n\nDid my sentence accurately reflect OED's version of events? If not, where did I go wrong? If so, is OED's etymology more reliable than MW &amp; OE, or is MW &amp; OE more reliable than OED's? Thanks!",

This bugs me and I have tried to come up with why. I think it is because I see this sound change being applied to a word itself, rather than the sounds of the language. \n\nThere are plenty of other cases, like prefix/verb combinations, where it seems to me that it is the sounds that undergo change, not the words themselves. Like we might assume that since we can have no word final consonants in Pali (except in the case of assumed Sanskritisation) prefixes like *ud* would change to *u* - but they don't, since assimilation takes place *ud-pad* &gt; *up-pad* in combination with another word. \n\nWhat is the explanation for this? Is it to do with a difference in the way that prefixes are treated vs. pronouns? Is it just an exception? Or am I misunderstanding something? \n",
