        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/ymehvr/is_defund_the_police_the_worst_political_slogan/",
        "text": "According to [polls](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/10/26/growing-share-of-americans-say-they-want-more-spending-on-police-in-their-area/) the slogan \"Defund the police\" embraced by elements of the Black Lives Matter movement and some politicians and activists on the left is wildly unpopular. It has been used by Republicans and conservatives this election season to hammer Democrats as being \"soft on crime\" and unsupportive of policing given the sharp rise in crime since the pandemic. Most Democrats, even in liberal enclaves, have disavowed that message even if it alienates those progressives who wanted it to become a reality in some form or fashion.\n\nPutting that aside, how did it come to pass that such a slogan like \"defund the police\" could be considered so toxic a political brand so quickly? Did activists not know that calling for diminished policing was counterproductive? Did they want the policy implemented regardless of political repercussions?\n\nHave those on the pro-police right been vindicated or will those reforms like cashless bail and decriminalizing \"minor\" offenses be still on the books in blue areas after the midterm election regardless of the voters wishes? How should activists who want to pursue \"defund the police\" go from here especially with the 2024 presidential election up next?",

Is there a rise in people who will voluntarily support an authoritarian regime because they admit that they do not want or support democracy?  Finally, what can and should be done?
