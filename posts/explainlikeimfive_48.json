        "text": "I recently purchased a Razer Kraken V3 PRO for my PC gaming, primarily War Thunder. This headset offers 7.1 COMPATIBILITY, but does not come with an activation code. So I would have to buy a code (I think, I'm not positive Razer lets you do this). However, it does come with two free weeks of THX surround sound, which I will later have to pay for. It seems like a subscription service.\n\nAnyways, War Thunder is 7.1 surround sound at max, so I wanted someone to ELI5, does using a THX headset on a game set to 7.1 surround sound eliminate some of the surround sound effect? With how many surround sound systems out there, I was worried that by using a higher-tier surround sound system to listen to software of a lower-tier one, EX THX to 7.1, the system would fail to produce surround sound entirely. What am I losing? Should I just buy the 7.1 activation code and see?",
