Public opinion had been polarised throughout the war, but this was the NG killing Americans in America.\n\nWas there an initial political and media reaction that also blamed the protestors, and if so how was it that people could be so easily influenced? The sometimes violent provocation of the NG by a small section of the protest, and the recent attempted bombings by a more radical fringe of the anti-war movement obviously influenced things. But 58% is still a shock. \n\nIf the NG or another force opened fire on a BLM or anti-Trump protest with live rounds today, would that kind of percentage back them? Is that ‘Great Silent Majority’ still there?\n\nI’m asking as a European-dwelling non-American, so please excuse any ignorance on my part.",

Populism is anti elite - ie those blamed for liberal market crashed. Social Democracy is a reaction against populism - ie rewarding common man for living through populism (WW2), liberalism is a reaction against Social Democracy - ie clawing power back to the money makers. \n\nEach phase usually starts of pretty well but seems to crash and burn after a certain amount of time.

According to Orientalism , it seems some Japanese anime ， especially moe anime , is definitely Orientalism and objectify western culture and western female. But the problem is anime sexualize everything and strangely , no one really criticize anime in term of orientlism.\n\n&lt;A Certain Magical Index&gt; is a good example , the protagonist is a Japanese male , who defect a lot of western magic user/wizard/nun , as well as eastern spell user. I am quite sure the author is more interested of western magic system and thats why most of the enemy is from western background. Also , protagonist of &lt;A Certain Magical Index&gt; , do have couple of western female in his harem. Is this consider Orientalism ?\n\nAnother good example is some established visual characteristics of nations , for example Russian girl often has silver hair , USA girl has big breast , French girl acts like noble. If the stereotype of Chinese male has narrow eye is orientalism , is Russian girls are cool and have silver hair , be orientalism ?\n\nI am always confuse about Orientalism, if there is a animation about a white guy punching eastern magic users in the face , defeating almost every system of eastern magic school, and also have couple of Miko in his harem , this animation will be consider orientalism. I did some research and seems no one from western background consider anime for Orientalism western culture.\n\nI just feels like orientalism  is quite stupid , it consider Who create more important than What is created. I mean , if a American creator sexualise Inari Ōkami ( japanese fox deity), it will be consider orientalism ( even Japanese  there are countless porn about Inari Ōkami ).  But if a Japanese creator sexualise western religious figures , no one will cares.\n\nAlso , just curious , how do western people feel about when anime sexualize western symbol , like nun / Victoria maid / knight / witch ?\n\nExample of sexualising of nun in anime :\n\n[https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41m%2BY46Xk3L.jpg](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41m%2BY46Xk3L.jpg)\n\nExample of sexualising of wiches in anime :[https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K\\_Tr\\_SsiQFQ/maxresdefault.jpg](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K_Tr_SsiQFQ/maxresdefault.jpg)\n\n Girls und Panzer , a stereotype image of British female who drinks red tea all day:\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/FIp4Y0j.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/FIp4Y0j.jpg)",

However, in my study I did some surrounding literature research and looked for rural poverty research and what was happening on that front for comparison. I found very little modern (post 2008) research available. I didnt think much of it at the time, but now that my class is over and I have some free time, I am becoming more interested in that field of study as well as urban economies. Anyways, I have scoured the internet some more, and the few sources of research done in this field are either not specifically American based, or are heavily focused on agricultural dependent rural economies. This is fine and all, But I remember reading that the classical view of rural=farmer has become far less true than ever in history, and that most rural communities are manufacturing, semi-skilled industry, mining, or timber dependent or other such rough labor work that is not farming. Because of this, I want to see what research and findings are available for these types of communities and economies. In particular, I would like to find research that delves into policy fixes and revival efforts and revival success for these smaller rural communities and local economies. The closest source I have found is \"The American Journal of Economics and Sociology\", and it was only one article, and it too focused mainly on agriculture. If anyone has any advice, place, journal, site, or book that deals with these ideas/issues that you can point me to, I would be very grateful.",

And then the reverse, if one does act in a way that perpetuates discrimination and bigotry, how likely is it that they will recognize their feelings of racism and bigotry?\n\nI started wondering about this after two instances: \n\n1) hearing of KKK members who try to show they aren’t really racist, they just want to protect the “white race” from being taken over. This seems to be a case of one who acts or behaves in a racist manner yet does not openly recognize such behavior or beliefs - they want to dissociate their behavior from what is not “in fashion.” This further perpetuates their racism, bringing (in my mind) further systematic oppression. So, ones attempt to not be racist yet acting in a racist manner brings about racism.\n\n2) the open letter “dear white america” seems to indicate a feeling of regret for the implicit way in which the author benefits and implicitly agrees to systematic sexism, then asks that white people understand and start to have the same feelings towards the systematic racism in America. While I haven’t read the letter in a while, I got the feeling that the author felt this would alleviate at least some of the systematic oppression certain groups face.\n\nSo is there a connection between recognition of racism/sexism/discriminatoryeither explicit or implicit in oneself and the act of being racist/sexist/discriminatory.",

I personally stand on the idea that runaway inflation is a natural byproduct of the kind of poor economic management available to any society; not an inherent feature of the modern collectivist systems (your various flavors of Socialism and so on). \n\n It's not hard to find non-collectivist economies wracked by runaway inflation (Confederate America and Weimar Germany come to mind), but I just can't find any discussion of the opposite.  Plently of lists of countries getting themselves into the runaway inflation mess, but nothing on those that avoided it.\n\nWhat are the common elements of an economy that lend to runaway inflation? Is there any correlation between these elements and characteristics of popular political ideologies?  How do successful economies avoid runaway inflation, and how do they recover if they find themselves in that situation?\n\nMy best guess is that collectivist societies don't tend to appeal to, or encourage the development of, the kinds of economic minds that are likely to keep ahead of this kind of inflation.  Kind of like a village without a doctor is more likelyto suffer from plagues and diseases than one with a trained epidemiologist on hand.\n\nAm I completely full of shit on this?",

This is a man who I would not generally have considered to have some obviously offensive and bigoted beliefs. Anyways, he claims to be open to changing his mind after I told him that, beyond being extremely offensive, the science on the subject does not agree with him. Can you link me to some articles explaining the scientific consensus on this topic? I honestly don't have anything off the top of my head, and I figured I'd be better served asking you fine people instead spending an hour searching the web for some extremely basic science on the subject.

The demands of being at the top level of a field are increasingly more technical, but often, it seems, newer generations more easily met those demands.\n\nI'd like to know what this specific area of study is called. Almost all of what I find is on how individuals progress at, for instance, sports, not how entire sports, or domains of expertise themselves, become more complex and technical, and why they seem to at different rates. \n\nThanks in advance.",

For example, they don't have social anxiety, no disabilities, no confidence issues, or language barriers. They are around a lot of people and have opportunities to find people. Overall, people that are mentally/physically healthy, but choose not to have friends or keep only 1 or 2 around.\n\nI suck at finding good research.
