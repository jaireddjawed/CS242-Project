I also find value in religion, as it gives some people a sense of purpose and leads them down a 'lighter path' as opposed to a 'darker path' that they would follow without morality instilled into them.\n\nFor me, I have this 'belief', such that whenever I think of it, the idea helps me in bad situations and motivates me. This thought entails 'life' being overseen by a hyena, who brings me difficult situations to see me fail and then laugh hysterically. When I think of this, I catch myself and laugh at the situation, then proceed to end his laughter by succeeding. This is like a 'god', where this is the only supreme being, a 'satan' based one, and only brings difficult situations upon humans for his own laughter-he may just be the 'joker' god who is the only one who lived past those who created the big bang.\n\nI do not believe that any supreme being got humans and earth to where we are now, but I do find this thought of the hyena to help me, so would there be any harm in 'believing' in it? This would just add enrichment to my life, I would not spend every Sunday worshiping the hyena. My big question is, if many people can believe in a made up religion such as Christianity, would it be any different if I believed in this laughing hyena?",

This summer, a high school student got into a car accident and suffered from a coma for several days before she died. \n\nHer parents (possibly in connection with her church, I'm not sure) printed up t-shirts with her name, the word faith, a cross, and a Bible verse on them (I think it's John 17:3 but I may be remembering wrong). The t-shirts were sold at both schools by the younger sister and others (who is a middle school student). I'm not entirely sure where the proceeds are going but I believe they are either to help defray medical costs and/or set up a scholarship fund.\n\nThe school scheduled a day last month that everyone was supposed to wear their t-shirt and a lot of students and staff did. Additionally, the cheerleading squads of both schools painted posters with the student's name, the word faith, a cross, and the same Bible verse. These posters were hung prominently in the cafeterias of both schools and the gymnasium that both schools share. \n\nMy question is does this cross a line of church/state separation? I realize that this may depend on details that I am unsure of such as where the proceeds go or whether school officials were selling the t-shirts. I also think there may be a possibility that some of these actions are okay, but some of them aren't.\n\nThere is also the issue of coming across as insensitive to the family.

        "text": "I got tired of all the good or bad, right or wrong. So how about looking at religion (and science, for comparison) from a \"systems\" point of view? By reducing everything to core functionality, I ended up assuming that both science and religion are essentially systems that work with data. So this is what I came up with:\n\nReligion is repeating a small set of pre-programmed patterns.  \nScience is searching for new patterns.\n\nReligion filters and discards new (and old) data to protect its programming.  \nScience celebrates and tries to create and understand new data. Reprograms itself if new data requires it.\n\nReligion runs data through a single, poorly written and inconsistent algorithm.  \nScience runs data through many obsessively programmed and tested algorithms. Debugs itself constantly.\n\nReligion has many outputs, and they're designed to manipulate your feelings. It's unclear where the input is, if any.  \nScience has many inputs and one very accurate and complex output. This output is designed to not care. (Which is why the Philosophy add-on is highly recommended.)  \n  \n    \nThis is what i have so far. I'm not sure how well this model holds up, or if it has any utility, but i hope it's a conversation starter.\n\n    \n    \n**[RE-EDIT]**  \nOk, in the previous edit i got lost in analogies or word-play. Also, i hoped to be able to apply this \"model\" waaaay too broadly, on a society level. But for now, i think its most interesting application is from a neurological perspective. How religion or science \"run\" in the brain, not just as super memes, but as processing \"devices\", that have memory but also do \"work\", plus they have inputs and outputs.\n\nSo yeah, the OS comparisons in the comments may inadvertently (maybe intentionally) be useful, except it's not just the OS, but the entire computer-like device that is simulated (runs) in every individual brain.",

Much of the discussion has to do with an ancient prophecy from Ezekiel: “The word of the Lord came to me: ‘Son of man, set your face against Gog, of the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshek and Tubal; prophesy against him and say: “This is what the Sovereign Lord says: I am against you, Gog, chief prince of Meshek and Tubal”’” (Ezekiel 38:1–3). The identities of “Gog,” “Magog,” “Meshek,” and “Tubal” are the key to fully understanding the prophecy.\n\n&gt; Gog is a person. Whoever Gog is, he is from the land of Magog and is the leader of Tubal and Meshek (some translations add “Rosh” to the list) and a confederacy of other nations: Persia, Cush, Put, Gomer, and Beth Togarmah (Ezekiel 38:5–6). And, whoever he is, he will have plans to “attack a peaceful and unsuspecting people,” viz., Israel (verses 11, 14, and 18). But, regardless of Gog’s plans, the Lord God is against him and will defeat him soundly (Ezekiel 38:4, 19–23; 39:3–5).\n\n&gt; Magog is a land “in the far north,” from Israel’s point of view (Ezekiel 38:15; 39:2). Most Bible commentators interpret “Magog” as Russia—and, indeed, Russia is straight north of Israel, all the way up to the Arctic Circle. According to this view, “Rosh” is a reference to Russia, “Meshek” is either Moscow or the people north of the Black Sea (the area of southern Russia and Ukraine), and “Tubal,” which is always listed with Meshek in Scripture, is identified as a city in Siberia or an area in central Turkey.\n\n&gt; Others see “Magog” as a general term used in Ezekiel’s day to identify barbarians living near the Black and Caspian Seas. Regardless of the exact locations of Magog, Tubal, and Meshek, there is no doubt that the general area includes portions of Russia and the former Soviet Union, and possibly some Arab countries.\n\n&gt; So, yes, the Bible does mention Russia, although not by that name, in connection with the end times. Ezekiel 38—39 definitely refer to a nation coming from northern Asia to attack Israel. After the Cold War, Russia lost its superpower status, making the fulfillment of Ezekiel’s prophecy seem unlikely in some people’s eyes. However, recent events have shown that Russia is gaining strength, and many believe that the invasion of Crimea is just a first step in Russia’s plan to restore its dominance in that hemisphere. It is also interesting to note that, in the Soviet era, Moscow was solidly aligned with several Muslim countries in opposition to Israel. Since the breakup of the Soviet Union, Russia has continued to make overtures to the Muslim world.\n\n&gt; According to the Bible, there will come a time when Russia, in alliance with several other countries, will amass a huge army against Israel, with a view to plunder the Jews’ land. The nations aligned with Russia for this military endeavor are Persia (modern-day Iran), Put (modern-day Sudan), Cush (modern-day Libya), Gomer (part of modern-day Turkey), and Beth Togarmah (another portion of modern-day Turkey or possibly Syria). Most of these nations are currently militant Islamic states with an express hatred of Israel. Ezekiel says that, when the aggressors move against Israel, a few other nations (“Sheba and Dedan and the merchants of Tarshish”) will remonstrate, as will “all her villages”—possibly colonies (Ezekiel 38:13). Sheba and Dedan are associated with areas of northern Africa. Tarshish could be a reference to Spain (which colonized much of South America), Britain (which colonized the United States), or somewhere in eastern Africa. The objections to Magog’s aggression will fall on deaf ears, however, and the invasion will continue.\n\n&gt; Some commentators believe this war is one of the events leading up to beginning of the tribulation. Others believe it will occur close to the midpoint of the tribulation, since Israel will be “dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates” (Ezekiel 38:11)—in other words, Israel will feel secure at that time, possibly because of the covenant they have signed with the Antichrist (Daniel 9:27). Either way, this battle is distinct from the Battle of Armageddon, which occurs at the end of the tribulation.\n\n&gt; God promises to destroy Gog’s army: “I will execute judgment on him with plague and bloodshed; I will pour down torrents of rain, hailstones and burning sulfur on him and on his troops and on the many nations with him” (Ezekiel 38:22). The bodies of the fallen army of Magog will be buried, but it will take over seven months to complete the macabre task (Ezekiel 39:12, 14). This supernatural judgment will have the effect of preserving Israel and turning many hearts to God: “And so I will show my greatness and my holiness, and I will make myself known in the sight of many nations. Then they will know that I am the Lord” (Ezekiel 38:23). Many will be saved during the tribulation (Revelation 7), and the fulfillment of Ezekiel 38—39 will be one means by which God will bring people to a knowledge of Himself.\n\n&gt; There is much we do not know for certain about Ezekiel’s prophecy, including the timing of these events. However, it is clear that Russia will be involved and will in fact lead an end-times league of nations to seize Israel’s land. The prophet Ezekiel comforts Israel in much the same way as Moses had centuries ago: “The LORD your God is the one who goes with you to fight for you against your enemies to give you victory” (Deuteronomy 20:4).\n\n* http://www.gotquestions.org/Russia-end-times.html\n\nAs many have said...it is near impossible to \"get through\" to some people when they're believing things such as this. To me there is just so much wrong with it but because the prophecies are so vague it is near impossible to pull up factual information and say \"see...this is wrong!\" When so much is up to interpretation then there is always a loophole people can escape through. Specific portions that I think have the most \"potential\" for making salient points are...\n\n* And, whoever he is, he will have plans to “attack a peaceful and unsuspecting people,” viz., Israel (verses 11, 14, and 18). (/u/JohnnyMnemo pointing out Israel is far from peaceful or unsuspecting)\n\n* So, yes, the Bible does mention Russia, although not by that name, in connection with the end times. Ezekiel 38—39 definitely refer to a nation coming from northern Asia to attack Israel. (this is *such* a stretch and I don't think any reference to an nation from northern *Asia* is mentioned at all since Israel's worldview at this time wouldn't even stretch that far north)\n\n* view to plunder the Jews’ land (What value does Israel's line even hold? Oil? Geographic position?)\n ",

        "text": "I found my way into atheism 13 years ago when I read the Bible from beginning to end. What was most convincing to me was that the concept of God evolved within the Bible. In the first five books God is an anthropomorphic tribal deity (with the  ark becoming almost a totem). By the time you get to Revelation, God is an immaterial omnipresent being. Admittedly this process is not entirely smooth because the different authors had different god concepts in  their heads. However, seeing how the concept of God evolved was one of the final nails in the coffin of my liberal Christianity.\n\nThe other day I was thinking about some of the arguments Christians make to support their religion. Some Christians are able to see that the reasons they use to reject other religions also apply to Christianity. To resolve this cognitive dissonance they invent ways to make Christianity (or the Abrahamics) exceptional. That is where you get the strange assertions that Christianity is not a religion but a philosophy or similar notions. Sometimes liberal Christians will say that other religions are worshiping the same god but in a different way. \n\nAnyway to the point (finally)! I realized that the exceptionality is helped by certain proscriptions built into the religion. Because Jews (and subsequently Christians and Muslims) were not allowed to make images of God, this allows the transition from anthropomorphic tribal deity to immaterial omnipresent mind easier. It allows modern Christians to more easily ignore the origins of their deity. Additionally, the proscription (or at least tradition) of not using (writing?) Yahweh's name helped as well. Instead the vague generic term \"God\" is used.\n\nObviously, Christians would still try to argue that their religion is exceptional even without these proscriptions. My point is that these proscriptions helped facilitate  that perceived exceptionality.",

        "text": "Quick rundown:  \n \nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for some time now and are moving toward marriage.  She’s content with my atheism, as am I with her theism (she’s a very liberal Christian).  Several months back I agreed to go to an 8 week pre-marital course put on by a local church.  She’s not entirely sold on the theological underpinnings, but it meant a lot to her so I gladly obliged.  Being a large church, it brings in 125+ couples per class.  Basically, each couple is assigned a table with 3 other couples (4 total) which is then overseen by an assigned “mentor couple”.  I grew up Christian and have been out roughly 5 years, so this is going to be an interesting process for me.  \n \nWell, we just had the first class and, all in all, it was a little loopy.  One of the funnier things they are asking couples do is sign a Purity Pledge ensuring we will self-restrict to no more than small pecks on the cheek.  Of course, we’re obviously not going to do that.  One: because we don’t really care for the false guilt game, and Two: that’s none of their damn business.  Although the pledge is “optional”, I’m still excited to hear their thoughts when we say “no thanks”.  They’re also very strict about cohabitation and how it’s a big biblical no-no.  Seeing as we live together, we’ll not be doing that either.  \n \nBeside those two points, the first week has outlined the basic foundational elements of a biblical marriage (as defined by God) which, of course, consists of one man and one woman.  The church has also made it a personal mission to curb the Christian divorce rate (hence this course) and thus has a very rigid view of divorce, making it extremely difficult to get out of.  Because the first week was primarily an introduction, little time was given to subject material, but we were assigned homework.  This week was nothing more than a guided bible study, which I happily completed.  And as everyone knows, the bible can be a little ambiguous when it comes to sex, marriage, adultery, and divorce, so I went slightly above and beyond and provided contrary biblical sources for each talking point.  You know, to facilitate discussion.  My girlfriend’s response was the equivalent of an eye-roll.  Success!  \n \nAnyway, that’s where we are.  I’m posting because I couldn’t find any posts from atheists regarding their experience in a similar situation and wanted to share my story.  I'm not sure yet if I'll be coming out as an atheist to the group (for various personal reasons), but I'll definitely be asking some tough questions.  Speaking of, I'm happy to answer any questions you may have.  Regardless, I’ll post again following week 2.  \n\nEdit: [Week Two](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/3ohnxu/week_two_atheist_in_a_christian_premarital_class/)",

        "text": "So I recently moved back home with my parents because of some financial difficulties that I'm having at the moment. I have been living with them for a couple of months and I am at my wits end. My mother is a religious fanatic who makes Kim Davis seem lukewarm. As soon as I walk in the door to my house, she will start ranting about God. I am a prisoner in my home because I don't have the heart to tell her that I do not agree with her beliefs. As each day passes, I am becoming less patient and I have started to get into a lot of heated arguments with her. Here are some of her crazy beliefs.\n\n- She still thinks Obama is a Muslim\n- She thinks that we are living in the \"end times\" that was written in the book of Daniel and Revelations. Any negative world event seems to bolster her arguments. \"Oh there was an earthquake? That's because it is a sign of the end times. Isis just took over another village? It's because of the holy war that was foretold in the bible.\"\n- Videogames are a tool for the Devil to recruit people into his dark army. I shit you not. She actually believes this.\n- Anything negative that happens in life is because of the devil and his demons. She believes that there are specific demons that will cause certain catastrophes in your life. \"Oh you just lost your job? - That's because the demon of financial ruin is over your life. You need to repent and cast it out.\"\n- To contrast the previous point, anything positive in life is from Jesus. Jesus this, Jesus that. She cannot finish a sentence without mentioning Jesus. \"Oh you were diagnosed with cancer? Pray to Jesus and have faith for he is the great healer. The doctor performed a life saving procedure to save your life? It was Jesus who was guiding his hands.\"\n\nI am at a point where I genuinely think she needs some counseling. The problem is that she blames all of life's problems and issues on the Devil. It would be blasphemous to even mention the notion that she may have anxiety issues and that she may need help. In her mind, the only true answer to any of life's issues is to repent and pray to Jesus. I cannot get any logical points across to her. There are three factors that contribute to her fanaticism. She is stupid. Not the sharpest tool in the shed. She is stubborn. I have never seen her apologize. Ever. She is also very fearful of everything. These personality traits make it impossible to reason with her. I would like to get the fuck out of my house again, but I am in no situation to move out. I may need to endure her crazy rants for another year. How do I deal with her? Has anyone ever converted their loved ones away from religion? Is it even possible? Help!\n\n\nTLDR: Living with a crazy religious nut who happens to be my mom. What can I do to sway her away from her beliefs?\n\nEdit: Thank you for all of the advice, I read everyone's comments and I have decided to try my best to ignore her and get my ass out of the house.

I actually like Pope Francis: he seems to be doing great things for the church, pushing for more \"progressive\" ideas and encouraging others to live their lives with compassion. I, of course, struggle with the anti-abortion/contraception/female priests/homosexuality bit, but I think he's focused on the right things. \n\nA life centered around and espousing compassion, mercy, and forgiveness as the main tenants of the religion would water down the aggressive push to ban abortion/gay marriage/etc. You can't live a life of compassion/mercy/forgiveness if you're full of fear, anger, judgment, and seeking to strip someone of their peace and happiness. In my mind, it's the first step in approaching the world with openness--it'd definitely make discussing things with them easier (and pushing them to engage a little more with their beliefs... maybe even influencing a \"change of heart\")...\n\nAll that to say, I think the Pope has pushed for the right things and avoided pulling the rug out from under a lot of people... the thing that is really sad, though, is the amount of push back he's gotten for encouraging a life lived with love and compassion.\n\n**Questions**:\n\n1.

        "text": "(Note: This is somewhat of a personal story, so if not appropriate for this sub feel free to remove/not read)\n\nSo I made this post roughly a day ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/3mh4xu/for_antitheists_do_you_think_religion_is/\n\nI enjoyed the discussion that took place in that thread, and though it didn't change my perspective, something that happened today did. I thought I would share.\n\nTo make a long backstory short, I have been attending Campus Ministry meetings, and going to a Church over the last couple of weeks. Why? Oddly enough I enjoy the fellowship, so take that for what you will.\n\nThe sermons have been fairly pedestrian up to this point (from a Biblical Christian frame of reference). Today however, the pastor saw fit to talk about \"Spiritual Warfare\", as a result of a string of unfortunate coincidences that have occurred to the Church and members of 10-man mission team they are sending to India. The idea that some Christians believe that demons/Satan can cause bad things to happen is not new to me, but the way the man riled up the crowd emotionally with this message was something I had never seen before. Half of the worship team was crying, and some of the acquaintances I was with were visibly moved to tears by the sermon. \n\nThis man, this pastor, had the crowd in the palm of his hand. At that moment I truly think that he could have fingered someone in the crowd (me, possibly) as possessed by a demon, and that someone else in the crowd would have attacked that person.\n\nHow do you argue with that? How do deal with someone who can be so easily convinced that the person sitting next to them is an agent of some demonic force? You can't. There is no statement you can make that might change their mind, because their belief is beyond any notion of reason I am capable of recognizing. \n\nI made a mistake, a horrible mistake in fact. I have been assuming up to this point, that there is at least some degree of rationality where there is none. Perhaps I wanted to think that *really* they were just theists, because how can anyone *really* interpret the bible literally, to the point that they can be convinced that there are demons in the electrical outlets?\n\nI love the sheep, but the shepherds are nothing less than wolves. \n\nIn that respect, I'm an anti-theist.

        "text": "Hey all,\n\nI've been wondering about this for a while now and I wanted to shame my thoughts so I can get yours.\n\nI am thoroughly fascinated by religion and the meme itself. It's almost like its been purposefully engineered, but we know it has evolved over time to attach itself to our cognitive flaws.\n\nAnyways, so religion works in both rich nations and poor nations alike. I think this makes sense in poor nations because the people need some symbol of hope dealing with droughts, crippling poverty, starvation, ongoing conflict, disease, abuse and high infant mortality. So it makes sense that religion would raise a tent in those parts of the world and start handing out The Good Word.\n\nHowever, in rich \"first world\" countries, we are kinda spoiled. Paved roads, first-rate doctors, eradicated diseases, a middle class, no internal wars, regulated food and water industries, low infant mortality, a police system, a strong military, weather alerts, courts, and so on. So from that perspective, looking at the world where our fellow humans have it worse off, can make it seem like you and I have a pretty sweet thing going on here.\n\nAnd religion can take credit for it all. You got into a car-wreck but was saved by safety standards? Thank religion! They rushed you to the hospital on paved roads in an ambulance? Thank religion! Your doctors are licensed and certified and have to maintain a clean hospital? Thank religion! You did not die on the operating table thanks to the skilled surgeons? Thank religion!\n\nWe enjoy a lot of modern comforts and I wonder if that makes it easier for someone to claim religion provided all that.\n\nSo that makes me wonder; as we become more technologically advanced, live longer and live easier, will religion just evolve alongside that progress and stand behind innovations taking credit for when those advances save your life or make it easier? If religion can \"troll\" to stay relevant, will a modern society ever truly get rid of it?\n\nWhat do you think? You should share your thoughts.",

I'm not disputing that, but I wanted to point out that they didn't intend this in order to make every citizen a secular citizen, but because what every founder- religious and secular- had in common was persecution for not toeing the line, particularly to the Anglican church.\n\nIt's important to remember that, at that time, being an atheist wasn't an easy rational decision to make, and many of them never made that decision, and *this doesn't mean anything about the truth or falsehood of religion*, because- as religious people, seeking to protect *their own* rights- they agreed on secularism as the things that, regardless of their faith or lack of it, they could agree upon.\n\nSo, why is this relevant here? Because, in the interest of making the meme of atheism more contagious, I want us to have better tools for engaging theists. And the best tool is the truth, and the courage to face it. This is one of the things we have to acknowledge about the past- that atheists like Thomas Jefferson &lt;probably&gt; had to hide their atheism and present themselves reasonably to theists, and they were able to work with them- and so should we.\n\nedit: that last sentence is clumsily worded, but I'm saying we should work with theists, not hide from them &lt;except, possibly, if you're in danger of being killed for not toeing some theological line, and even then, you should do what you reasonably can to undermine such a system&gt;.",

Whether it will be in 300 years or 3000 years is yet to be seen. Trends currently show the percentage of irreligious people to be on the rise in all of the developed countries. Although this does not appear to be the trend worldwide, I think that as developing countries eventually become developed and as our knowledge of science becomes larger and available to more people, we may eventually see a percentage increase of irreligious people worldwide. \n\nAs religious people become older and die off, I think it's totally possible in the far future that religious people will be a small minority of the world population. A post-theistic world as a result. I think that such a world would be great for the human race (or whatever we are by this point, maybe posthuman).

Because of that, I want to try and salvage this relationship while I can because I know that when she gets older, we'll likely be incredibly distant if she continues on this current path.\n\nThat said, I've recently learned that the church my sister goes to has taken her and other children to Creationist museums, heavily condemns scholarly work on the Bible (e.g. \"the devil uses college professors to corrupt our believers and lead them astray\") and questioning God in general, and plays whatever victim card it can to make her and all other congregates feel as if the world hates them and wants to persecute them. \n\nTo make matters worse, I also learned that she's been going to these Awakening events where the goal is to strengthen the faith of the children/teens so that they become comfortable in their isolation from the world as a result of their \"relationship with God\". When I tried to talk to her about the finer details, she was very distant from me (which usually isn't the case) and all I could manage to get out of her was that she wasn't allowed to talk about what exactly she was told while there (also, no one who was there was allowed to contact anyone else outside the church).\n\nSince then, I've learned that she'll have more meetings to go to from the church, and she's prioritizing them over plans that we had already. Consequently, my influence is limited and I know that the people she talks to will have a stronger hold on her than I have.\n\nIn short, I don't want to lose her. Even though I wasn't nearly as brainwashed (for lack of a better word) as she is, Christianity greatly crippled my fulfillment as a human being, and it led to all kinds of circumstances in which I was depressed and felt victimized due to human nature (aka \"sin\") and the notion that the world was against me.\n\nI don't want her to go through that and I want to stop the influence that this church has on her, but I don't know what to do. I just don't want to sit by and watch her get corrupted like this. \n \n**Edit:** For clarification, my sister is 14. \n\n**Edit 2:** All of you are amazing people and you've all helped me out so much. I used some of the advice given today when I went to pick my sister up from school, and we didn't speak a word about religion or the group she went to. We just talked about other more light-hearted stuff and had a decent time. Now, naturally I'm still concerned for her because I've gone through the motions already with Christianity, but either way I could see that she wasn't as emotionally distant from me as she was before. \n\nSo guys, thanks for the help. This is going to be a marathon with her but I got a glimmer of hope today, and really that's enough for me given the circumstances. Stay awesome, people.",

        "text": "I'm always annoyed at religious apologists that try to label outspoken atheists as \"fundamentalists,\" \"the same as religious extremists\" or \"Islamophobes.\" There are many rebuttals to this kind of ridiculous rhetoric, especially when it's applied to people who are merely criticizing ideas, opposing violence, and encouraging Science and free-thought.\n\nBut these past few days I've experienced something that made me think that we need to take a moment and talk about how being atheists and claiming to be skeptics does not necessarily exclude us from irrational thinking. I'm pretty sure the vast majority of people here will agree with that. We are all vulnerable to these things.\n\nTo provide an example of what I mean, the particular incident that made me realize this was a discussion I had with an outspoken atheist who has been ranting about how the whole clock/fake bomb incident was orchestrated by Ahmed, the kid that was arrested, and anybody who thinks otherwise is an idiot and \"shouldn't be here\" (I was banned from his page for questioning him). What I want to highlight is that this guy expressed that he didn't believe the official story, which is fine, but instead of stopping there, he had full certainty in the opposing narrative with very poor evidence, and most of his followers were agreeing with him, equating the unwillingness to jump to conclusions with stupidity and gullibility. This is *exactly* what conspiracy theorists do, and these atheists who think they have reason on their side are unknowingly using conspiracy theorist logic. To top it off, the reluctance to accept opposing view points (asking people to leave his page and banning) reminded me of how religion often promotes like-mindedness and censorship of opposition.\n\nI wanted to learn from this experience and was reminded that I need to be aware that religious or not, we're all vulnerable to faulty thinking. I just wanted to take a moment to remind everyone here as well and maybe learn something about myself through discussion. We all need some self-reflection from time to time.\n\nPS. For those who want a skeptical view of the clock incident, [this is a good article](http://blogs.artvoice.com/techvoice/2015/09/17/reverse-engineering-ahmed-mohameds-clock-and-ourselves/), although brace for the comment section.\n\nThis paragraph stood out to me:\n\n\"I don’t know any of these things. But I’m intellectually mature enough to admit I don’t know, and to also be OK with that. I don’t feel a need to take the first exit to conclusionville. But I do like to find facts where I can, and prefer to let them lead me to conclusions, rather than a knee jerk judgement based on a headline or sound bite.\"\n\nedit: Rephrased and removed the name of the person per mod's request.\n\nedit 2: thanks for my first gold, kind stranger!",

I am hoping to learn more about your experiences.\n\nLet's start with my story. I was born in a devout Hindu Brahmin family (which is the supposedly \"elite priestly caste\") in India. My family is very religious Hindu. I was an extremely curious child and wanted to know everything about everything. So naturally I gobbled up the religious myths and stuff as they were the only explanations I had access to. I knew more stories and myths hymns of Hinduism at the age of ten than most adults do. \n\nI loved to read. My dad was very happy about this and got me any and all books I asked for. I eventually drifted towards science, as they provided alternate explanations for phenomena. I soon noticed that my religious worldview was quite incompatible with the scientific one. This disturbed me and I thought about it a lot. One day as I was day dreaming in a language class, it struck me that a good god wouldn't make bad people aka the problem of evil. This is an especially big issue in hinduism as the god Krishna directly says that all actions as indirectly being caused by me and only happen because I will them to happen. In other words there is no free will in the christian sense. But apparently the karma for them is assigned to the doer and not to krishna.\n\nThat was kind of the last straw for me. I still nominally believed in a formless god but I thought that all the myths and the gods of religions were wrong or at least heavy allegories. I read about the philosophical answers to such questions. I was also getting quite interested in physics and mathematics (I'm now a grad student in physics) and learnt more about the scientific method and rationalism. I gradually came to the conclusion that there is no physical or philosophical proof for the existence of a benevolent, omnipotent god who deserves worship by the time I was in my high school.\n\nPS: One thing that surprised when reading about other peoples experiences, especially in the US was that how quick many families are to kickout children who are atheists. My parents are as devout Hindus as you can find, but I never had such a fear. \n\nEDIT: Responses from everyone is welcome of course :), but I was talking about atheists from a non christian background. Sorry about the confusion and thanks for such interesting stories",

        "text": "Google definition:  disbelief or lack of belief in the existence of God or gods.\n\nWe consistently take this definition at face value, but I think it neglects to account for the fact that there is some level of thought that atheists have applied to arrive at their \"disbelief\" or \"lack of belief.\"  Okay, yes, we are all born atheists because we have had no exposure to the idea of God or gods.  Before I mentioned my made-up God Blizzerblozzer who lives in the stapler on my desk, you were atheistic about Him to the extent you lacked a belief.  And now you *still* lack a belief, but that lack of a belief is based on logic and critical thinking -- namely, all evidence for Blizzerblozzer thus far sounds utterly ridiculous.  The baby atheist is very different from us because we actually hold a position on the question, \"Do you believe in X God?\"  We applied some level of logic and critical thinking -- although perhaps improperly -- to arrive at our position:\n\n&gt; At this point in time, the evidence for X God has not convinced me that It exists.\n\nWe are not NULL on the question of whether we believe in X God.  Even merely a lack of belief is a position through the exercise of some level of thought.\n\nDoes this make sense or am I way out in left field here?  Perhaps there is no reason for the distinction, but I feel that not acknowledging this somehow encourages the theists to imply that we should not be allowed to participate in the discussion because \"What do you care?  You atheists don't even have a position!\"",

        "text": "A little background: About 5 years ago, I expressed having some doubt about God to my devout Presbyterian parents. Over those five years they have grown increasingly worried as I started to get more solidified into atheism. Last year I told them that I was an atheist. As I've read many times on reddit, this is not a smart move if you still live with your parents. Which I currently do. However, the relationship between my parents and I is really good other than this one issue. When I expressed doubt they were patient with me. When I did tell them I was a full blown atheist, they didn't kick me out, although they did show some contempt for my beliefs. They sent me to talk to an apologist pastor in an attempt to convince me back using \"logic\". It obviously did work. Last night my dad woke me up to talk to me about it. However it was different from the usual talk this time.\n\nLately, my dad has been having difficulty finding a new job. He's applied in a lot of places with no luck. My mother runs a shop, but business is extremely slow. My parents are in a load of debt. My sister and I had to pay the utility bills last month with our scholarship money. My parents had to borrow to pay the rent last month as well. \n\nWe've been having a little bad luck lately as well. Everyone in the house got sick a month back. My sister was followed by an unknown person when she drove back from work yesterday. My dad was also following her so he used his car to discourage the person. \n\nI think that was the tipping point. All night my dad was paranoid, and rightfully so given what happened. During our talk (more of a vent/lecture), my dad said that because I had let sin into the house by deconverting, God's protection had left the house. These hardships were the result. He essentially blamed the bad stuff that has been happening to us on me. He told me that for those 5 years he had been patient with me, but this was the last straw. Apparently this was revealed to him as he was fasting for the past 30 days.\n\nHe also began to berate me. He told me that just because I got good grades in school doesn't mean I'm smart, then quoted Psalm 14:1. He asked me a bunch of questions like \"How many grains of sand are there on the Earth?\" and \"If you drained all he blood in your body how much would you weigh?\" Probably to illustrate that I was dumb just because I didn't know the answer immediately. He used the \"I'm older than you so I know what I'm talking about\" argument. \n\nMy father had a pretty hard childhood, growing up in Ghana. He told the story about how he would get abused by his older brother over trivial things. \"If I had a good father, I would have been able to follow my dreams,\" he said. Dad remarked that he wanted a good relationship with me. Saying that he and my mother can't fully love me knowing that I reject the notion of God. \"To reject God is to reject your mother and I.\" He said that he just wants me to be obedient as long as I stay in the house. Only then can he and my mother have a full relationship with them.\n\nThat hurt.\n\nHe also enlightened me as to how atheists are all devil worshipers that lure in new deconverts to kill/sacrifice them. He told me that by saying there is no god and reading atheist literature, that I am putting myself and my family at risk. He said that if I continue down this road, he will do what ever is necessary to protect the family, even if it means kicking me out.\n\nThrough out the entire thing, I just stayed quiet. I was taken back by all this. It was like every christian parent's response to an atheist child was thrown all at once at me. I knew this would happen eventually but I didn't expect it to hurt this much.\n\nI am considering stockpiling money and resources so that I can move out soon. I'm 21 and I would have to leave eventually anyways. In the mean time I'll just pretend. What do you guys think?\n\n**TL;DR** Bad things happened and parents think its because of my atheism. Dad gives me the ultimatum. What do?",

After reading the inferno I just felt shitty at the possible circle I would be sent to for not believing in god, for being lustful, for being violent, wrathful, gluttonous and each one of those circles are the worst thing that could happen to a person. This is what they want to happen to me and people that are human. If a god is really worried about your soul then why threaten you with the worst thing imaginable? It's like having someone tie you over a vat of acid and unless you swear your fealty to them then they'll dump you in and keep telling you they love you. The fuck no you don't or we wouldn't be here.\n\nThe depiction if heaven in paradise was also not something I would want to be a part of. Why do religious people insist the place where all you do is give glory to god is such a good \"reward\" for following the rules? As a human I've enjoyed the many worldly things I've taken part in and that is infinitely better than heaven. \n\nAlso another I noticed during the inferno is how he used creatures from other mythologies.

        "text": "I'm interested to know if any atheists, who were previously Christian, have similar stories about when they lost their faith in God. \n\nSo to start, I will tell how I became a non-theist/atheist. I have lived in the Bible Belt my entire life. Both of my parents were Christian and took me to church every week. Throughout high school I was very involved in my youth group until I stopped going my junior year. \n\nDuring this time one of my atheist friends and I started debating religion. I still remember what it felt like to be on the other side of the religion debate. I was God's humble servant that would ultimately save my atheist friend’s soul no matter the cost... However, when I listened to his arguments, I couldn’t refute any of them. He would argue that I wouldn’t be a Christian if I was born in Iran or someplace where Christianity wasn’t the dominant religion. He’d also ask the simple question of “why do you believe in god” and the only answer I could think of was either because I was raised that way or because I just have faith. Neither one of these answers was sufficient to my atheist friend, but more importantly these answers weren’t sufficient to me. Why did I believe in God? Because someone told me to? Because I was born into it? Because I should just have faith? No! No! No! There must be a reason why I SHOULD believe! Right?... \n\n And while I cannot say that I became an atheist then and there, I do believe debating religion with my friend was the largest factor in gaining the knowledge that was no Christian God. My religious indoctrination that I had undergone my entire life was too powerful for an instant conversion, as is most people’s. Over time I gained a dislike for listening to sermons and going to church. Eventually, I came to the conclusion that there was no God sometime in my senior year of high school. After my realization, when I would think of there being no God, I became afraid. I didn’t want to die, I wanted to go to heaven. I wanted God to be real. \n\nI realized even further that God, even though he is fake, made people comfortable with death. But I became strong, and death doesn’t scare me anymore. Everyone dies, so it’s no big deal. And with that statement I no longer needed there to be a god. I now call myself a non-theist mainly because atheist has such a negative connation. However, I would also admit to being an atheist I you asked if I were one. In conclusion, this experience was one of the hardest things for me to undergo, but I know I am better for it. \n",

As such, I can speak to what it was like to be a younger atheist  and what it is like to be older. If there is one message I could impart, it is this \"It gets better!\".\n\nWhen you are in your 40's and have some gray hairs, people treat you differently. In many ways, with more respect. People start assuming you have money and they treat you better when they think you are a potential customer or someone important enough to get them in trouble if they act up. Nobody rolls their eyes, or asks if you are sitting in First class \"by mistake\", or assumes you are young and inexperienced which helps at car dealerships and other such negotiations. \n\nBut notably, NOBODY has tried to recruit me into a religion since I was 28. When a few mormon kids knock on my door and I answer, they feel like they are looking at their dads and they have a natural tendency to take a submissive stance, hand a flyer and walk away. I fly a lot. I have not had a seat mate try to talk about jesus with me since I was 30. Fewer and fewer religious nuts have approached me as I got older, on the assumption that I was someone at an age who had settled into their position no matter what it may be. When I have atheist discussions or arguments, my opponents tend to avoid going down the path of \"Well, you know nothing\" and I never get the \"you are too young to decide\" bit. Rather, at my age, as someone who has been an atheist since day 1, I know all the arguments, all the responses, all the ways to say them, and I can handle anything a theist will throw at me because I have done it and heard it all a million times over. My methodology is honed. I have a depth of experience that comes from decades of this.  At this stage, I could debate in my sleep. \n\nBut younger atheists. It's harder. WAY harder. \n\nFor one thing, you get no respect by virtue of being young alone. Even outside the atheism issue, you get treated like shit. Disrespected by customer service reps, wait staff, etc. The 28 year old person hates to serve the 20 year old. Then there is the issue of family, who still pretty much see you as property, or as someone who must do what they say (even if you live on your own). You become a target of a constant stream of unsolicited advice, and it feels like your basic rights are being violated, usually by family. More so as a teen. \n\nWhen you are younger, you are still seen by religious recruiters as someone potentially viable for conversion. Not set in your ways yet. \"Ripe for the picking\". I was approached by more religious stalkers as a teen than at any other time in my life. As an older adult, you can get away with telling them to fuck off. As a teen, this only makes them try harder. Worse, although your grasp of the arguments may be good, it's still new and not backed up by a wealth of experience in dealing with such people. I have seen so many naieve young atheists picking battles with street preachers..lol..because they don't know how to pick their battles yet. Younger people face the problems of romantic relationships and their extended families too. If unmarried, the potential in-laws can still have a major fucking impact on your new relationship. At 42, if someone's parents have a problem with my lack of religion, it doesn't mean shit. At best, they whine and moan sometimes. But when you are in your 40's, your parents opinions about how your should live a distant, meaningless noise that is usually ignored. You are established already. \n\nSo no matter how much it sucks for you now, it gets easier with each passing year. ",

        "text": "Last night I unwittingly ended up getting into a debate on the topic of abortion and morality, to be continued later today, with a Catholic youth pastor. So far he has attempted to hide behind smoke and mirrors to mask his connections with a local catholic church. His argument consists of:\n\n* Life begins when the egg meets the sperm\n\n* All life is sacred and in need of saving\n\n* Contraceptives are useless and actually create a sense of complacency,  which leads to MORE unwanted pregnancies\n\n* Fetus rights trump women's rights\n\n* Abortion is the same as eugenics in nazi germany\n\n* Unborn fetus' are no different than an adult in a coma when it comes to termination\n\n* Theocratic legislation is not forcing morals on unwilling people\n\n* I am literally Hitler who would further a message of killing off the weak and voiceless for the benefit of the strong\n\n* The old and new testament are both equally valid, though the punishments for breaking it's commandments are flexible(?)\n\n* The message/teachings of the church has not changed in the history of the Vatican. \"Catholics recognize Scripture AND Tradition. Scripture has the words, but Tradition in the form of the Church and scholars, governing bodies, the Pope, etc. make sure that the original message is maintained and upheld.\"\n\nHe has made appeals to science stating that it agrees with him on the point at which life begins. He genuinely believes scientific fact is on his side concerning the start of life, the soul, and teen pregnancy statistics. He gives no merit to the idea that science lacks an intent with using certain terms, life in terms of science, does not equate to life in the eyes of the religious, science does not acknowledge the question of a soul and life being intertwined as it is an invalid question since it can not be tested.  \n\nHe seems unwilling to analyze the hypocrisy, and misunderstanding of science applied within his arguments. Neither will he bend to the idea that his stance is forcing unwilling people to bend to his sense of morality by stripping them of a choice concerning their own body. On the contrary, I am forcibly inflicting my own morals on the helpless fetus by calling it a mere clump of cells and supporting woman's choice to exercise their own beliefs. I am honestly at a loss as to how unflinching a person can be.\n\nI have argued for the rights of the mother over her own reproductive health/privacy/decision making. The fact that, I believe, if the fetus is unable to sustain life outside the womb, then it is at the mercy of it's mothers decisions and deserves no rights. This is why 3rd trimester abortions are generally not allowed, the ability of the nearly complete baby to potentially sustain life outside the womb.  \n\nOf course it has been the typical question dodging, complete lack of acknowledgement of important questions, the shifting of the burden of proof, the hiding who he was at first then explosive confession wrapped in what seems like annoyance at having to acknowledge the elephant in the room. **\"Gift from GOD. I said it! The G-word. Yes, ethics and morals ultimately lead to God. If there is something greater than us that created us, it means we might not decide right and wrong. So it's not that I just disagree with you about abortion its that we disagree on whether God exists.\"** The thing the put him over the edge to admitting this was when I posted this, **\"It is a gift from who? Those who are bigger and more powerful than you. What purpose do we have beyond procreation and the furthering of our DNA?\"** \n\nI still have not made a single reference to my position on religion, so he is assuming I am a non-believer coming into this. Where should i go from here? How should i wrangle the fountain of questions in my direction? \n\n**EDIT** \n\nOk so we just had a go round, he is entirely unreasonable. The use of bible verses on my end are typically **\"out of context\", but his use is perfectly acceptable.\nWe ended at this i questioned the reliability of the bible if it can not be used to argue the morality of his deity.\n\nMe- \"So the bible is unreliably at best, then right? Say we toss out the bible all together. What if anything can you use to prove 1 a deity 2 your deity 3 his rules/morals?\"\n\nPastor - \"Unreliable? No. In need to actually studying, yes. Djsanchez2, there is no point in arguing about the Bible if we haven't even discussed rational proofs for a creator.\"\n\nThen he pointed to this http://www.strangenotions.com/god-exists/[1] and said we can discuss this later. Again deflecting from the OP concerning morality and abortion.\n\n**Edit** \n\nWhelp now it seems he is turning to Pascals wager. Ugh. I am done. He seems to be a master at circular reasoning and has the skull of a brick. We can no longer move forward unless I acknowledge the existence of a (his) deity. \n\nThanks fro all the input fellas. If nothing else, your comments helped me gain a deeper understanding of his stern position on the matter and the flaws inherent to them. ",
