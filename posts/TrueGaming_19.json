        "text": "So I had presented this interesting (not original though) idea in dark souls 3 subreddit.\n\nLet me brief it here.\n\nRather than traditional difficulty modes or no difficulty mode.\n\nLet me introduce to you folks-\n\n1.Recommended mode\n\n2.Experimental mode or custom mode or cheat mode or whatever you want to call it.\n\nRecommended mode would give you or the player the \"intended experience\".\n\nExperimental mode would give you full control over some basic parameters like player/enemy damage,health, etc.\n\nYou can also add accessibility features for people who are mentally disabled like slowing the game speed. Or you can increase the game speed for increased challenge. This mode does not need to be balanced,meaning you can tweak sliders as much as you want but also need to kind of check if it suits you or not. Of course the mode need to be balanced enough so that game does not freeze or crash or destroy your cpu. The mode will be kind of like a stable cheat mode like in gta games, celeste etc.\n\nEh... that's it.\n\nIf you want to read a little more and read some comments on DS3 subreddit about my idea. Here is the link\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls3/comments/8gk8qp/an\\_interesting\\_mode\\_that\\_i\\_think\\_could\\_improve/](https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls3/comments/8gk8qp/an_interesting_mode_that_i_think_could_improve/)\n\n​\n\nSo what do you think fellows? Any suggestions to improve this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: I should have named the title differently :p.",

Unless you look things up, you have no idea where an ability will be. You simply stumble into them.\n\n\nMaybe if I ever replay the game, I'll find this less of an issue, where I can hopefully remember more optional areas and make the game feel smaller. But right now, man, it's kinda suffocating.\n\nWe all know it's got a great art style and soundtrack, but I think some are dazzled by those elements and refuse to look at the game's core. What is your opinion on Hollow Knight and its strengths/weaknesses? Is it as great as people say or do you agree there are some flaws that can't really be ignored? \n",

        "text": "I feel like experience in many games is designed in a way, which encourages some sort of \"bullying\" and is often also counterintuitive to the term itself. Experience is in my opinion not needed in many games, it has just leaked in to non-rpg genres, because it's very addictive in nature. Making you want to play more to achieve higher levels or whatever, is good way to keep players playing.\n\nIn my opinion, experience is supposed to make players feel, that they are doing the right thing. Do stuff which yields high xp, avoid stuff which doesn't give you any. In this context, you should get most xp from achieving the games main objectives. Most games have some main objective, like capturing a base in fps, but there is also the incentive of killing enemies, which comes in the way sometimes.\n\nNone of us like to die in games. It's irritating in itself to be deemed worse in a situation, but also some games have long respawn time, so you don't get to play immediately after dying. This, combined with player kills yielding usually most amount of xp, can create situations where playing is just torture for the underdog team. Getting killed over and over again, without decent possibility to win while enemy is rewarded with xp, is not nice. Sometimes the enemy also stalls winning the match, because they are rewarded with some fixed amount of xp for wins, and get more in total for killing before winning.\n\nQuitting the match would be a viable option, but with many games having some sort of punishment system for quitters, it becomes a situation where there is no good solution for the loser. Am I just playing games, where this sort of not thought through systems are in place, or are you also noticing this kind of development? How do you feel about winner getting \"the whole cake\", leaving only some crumples to the loser?",

        "text": "Here's a hypothesis I've been thinking about, I wonder what people think of it.\n\n\nFirst of all, let me say that I'm sure there are real racists / misogynists / homophobes / etc etc out there.  But, when researchers and journalists are gathering data by looking at twitter comments, in-game chat, etc, I wonder if their numbers are overinflated due to what I call, \"schoolyard mentality.\"  Like, say, 50% of the comments are from true racists/etc, whereas 50% are \"schoolyard\" comments.\n\n\nWhat do I mean by \"schoolyard mentality\"?  In the schoolyard, your objective is to get a reaction.  If they cry, get angry, run away, start a fight, are offended, are hurt, tell the teacher - you win.  Usually this means finding a weakness, any weakness, and attacking it.  And one form of weakness is difference of any kind. (Edit: difference from the locally dominant group.)\n\n\nIf they are fat, you attack them for being fat.  If they are skinny, you attack them for being skinny.  If they are asian, you attack them for being asian.  If they are female, you attack them for being female.  If they have a huge mole on their face, if they stutter, if they have an accent, if their parents are divorced, if their clothes are the wrong brand.  If they are bad at a game.  If they are too good at a game.  Black, young, old, rich, poor, stupid, smart... anything is fair game to a cruel and creative mind.  Heck, even some forms of \"whiteness\" and \"maleness\" can be attacked.  And if the person is perfectly normal and has no obvious weaknesses, well, you can always tell them to get cancer and die.\n\n\nI don't know what proportion of online toxicity come from schoolyard mentality, and what proportion are genuine biases that those people apply to the normal parts of their life (eg. hiring decisions.)  But I get the feeling that, no matter what form of bigotry a journalist or researcher is looking for, they will find it, because schoolyard mentality attacks pretty much anyone and anything.\n\n\nI suppose the prevalence of schoolyard mentality online is its own problem, but when journalists and researchers conflate this with true bigotry/prejudice, they are mistaking the real causes of this behaviour and therefore making it harder to come up with a proper solution.\n\nedit: I suppose in the context of the internet, this \"trolling\" could be an appropriate term.  But I think schoolyard behaviours cover an area broader than trolling. \n\n\nedit2:  I think some people are assuming I'm trying to excuse or reduce the severity of the behaviour by calling it \"schoolyard\", that's not my intention, I just thought it was a very descriptive metaphor.  Perhaps a more adult word might be \"cruelty\" or \"sadism\"?\n\n\nedit3: A number of people have made the point that it's irrelevant what the underlying motivations are, the actual speech itself is still racist / sexist / etc and the person is being racist / sexist / etc by saying it.  I agree.   My hypothesis is that there is meaning behind identifying those who genuinely hold those views, versus those who use those views as part of their arsenal to attack others, as I feel those problems might need to be tackled in different ways.  But many commenters disagree, that's fine.",

In temtem you have to travel to different locations in order to get 8 macguffins in order to become the temtem champion. Doesn't that sound familiar? My problem with this is it's going down the formulaic route which doesn't really give it much of an identity. Pokemon themselves have proven that you don't need to use the gym to make a Pokemon (or in this case Pokemon inspired) game work, so- why can't temtem do something creative with the premise. In my eyes temtem it's just way too similar to Pokemon.",

        "text": "I'm someone who's rarely on the bleeding edge of a game's release, opting to save money or wait for \"definitive\" editions of a game in lieu of enjoying a shared experience with strangers. As a result, I've noticed how quickly people up and leave these realms for the next hot thing. It's a no-brainer that, with only so much time and attention to dedicate to things, people are going to go where the excitement's at, but I'm realizing how video games, often being a shared experience, are left behind and never returned to in a way that seems exclusive to the medium. People go back and watch old movies, read old books, and listen to old songs. With the exception of some games that hold nostalgic value, which only carries someone for so long, when a game community dies, it ***dies***.\n\n​\n\nWhen I go trawling for game deals or overlooked gems on Steam, I'll come across games that seem to have a truly novel premise and potential for great moments that have reviews that are months apart lamenting the lack of players. I know there's a Steam group dedicated to resurrecting old classics for another ride around the block, but it sort of baffles me how people don't uncover a game, go \"Oh wow, this actually looks like a blast\", and recreate a community to enjoy it again. It just doesn't happen at all, or if it does I've yet to hear an example of it. The closest examples I can think of are maybe the Tecmo Super Bowl community (though I feel like that community has been sustained since the title's launch) and the ZakStunts community.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know if I can say this makes me sad, but it is a little disheartening. Even if something is the low cost of free, or you have a potentially great idea that breathes life into an old game, people are remiss to give it a chance. Do you have any examples of this being the case? Have you seen examples of a high-profile Twitch/YT personality garnering new attention to an old game after doing a stream/episode featuring it? Have you run into the problem I mentioned above in trying to rally people around a \"dead\" game?",

But for every world that grabs me there are a lot more that fail to live up to those standards. \n\none big factor Is that many of them don't feel like real places. They feel more like contrived environments that only exist to serve the player. the worlds of the witcher 3, god of war for example. It feels like a big illusion. In witcher every building is a facade you are unable to enter, every NPC just stands there doing nothing at all. everything you can do and everywhere you can go is to serve a quest or a story centered around geralt. the rest of the world isn't there. in god of war and a lot of linear games ,the world feels just like a theme park ride that has been deliberately built to funnel the player in one direction. invisible walls and no jumping are kind of the game equivalent of red tape saying no entry. \n\nWhen i explore dunwall I feel like i;m in a real place. there's history and a purpose for every single building, character, object. you can explore a lot of places, people's houses, sewers. they don't exist just for corvo to go down, or for a cool setpiece. they exist because those places exist in a world.\n\nCity 17 in half life is a great example of a game that is extremely linear without the theme park problem. the way the player is guided feels far more natural, theres no white paint to tell you where you can and cant go, the level design itself does that, with clever lighting and clever design. when i play that game, i feel like i'm part of something greater that exists outside of just gordon freeman\n\nanyway thats just my 2 cents, i would like to hear your thoughts on the matter!",

Short, interesting games that function like episodes vs full games. Games that have a connected world feel, or even shared universes but not 20 hour games. \n\nImagine a sandbox game where each chapter is 7 to 10 hours, or so, worth of gameplay. They could share the same characters and even tell an overreacting story through the eyes of everyone involved. \n\nPerson A has an incident with Person B say going out on a date, where they could be chased by a group of deranged killers they get separated and have an adventure all on their own. \n\nPerson A may decide to run and hide from the killers and the game is told from them hiding and trying to avoid the killers, maybe reaching a car and trying to drive away. \n\nPerson B could be more adventurous and try to confront the killers or forced into a confrontation with them. The game could be you finding a gun, or other weapon, and trying to get the jump on the killers.\n\nYou could even throw in a cop who gets involved somehow maybe sees the car on the side of the road and decides to investigate. \n\nThe game doesn't even have to be connected that way. Maybe there was an seemingly unrelated event that affected different people in different ways.\n\nEpisodic games would be perfect for this! Especially for multiple play throughs. Each chapter could have an title and each new chapter could have a 1 to 2 minute recap. Honestly I'm surprised that Dontnod or Telltale hasn't done this. That way people won't feel that the choices don't matter in the grander scheme of things just in that play through.",

        "text": "I recently replayed through Bioshock: Infinite, and while i enjoy the intriguing story and pretty art direction, i found myself unsatisfied with the gameplay (probably because i'm not skilled with shooters).\n\nnow i won't compare this to the original Bioshock which had more immersive sim design philosophy behind it, but rather wish to understand what the designers' intentions were with this new game. \n\nthe first thing that baffles is why limit the player with only two guns in a shooter with spongy human enemies? one answer to that question is that the designers might've wanted the player to use vigors (magic) and not only rely on guns, but i personally found the process of aiming accurately while simultaneously planning optimal use of your vigors in the heat of battle to be somewhat hard to do. \n\nnow i imagine theoretically achieving that level of play of accurate shooting + clever use of vigors to end battles quickly, elegantly, and efficiently (without wasting too much health, ammo, and mana) would give the player an addictive amount of Adrenalin rush (kinda like those Cuhrazee combos from DMC), so i was wondering how many of you were able to achieve that level of skill at the game? and the reason i'm asking this is that I've notice the majority opinion on the game seems to criticize the gameplay (even from people who haven't played the original Bioshock).\n\nalso i must admit, i appreciate the kind of games that allow/feature a demonstrable skill gap between amateurs and pros.

It is fascinating and disturbing at the same time, to see how many people do harass others or being harassed in video games. I couldn't even say \"oh jeez, those are children\", because I experienced people in their mid 20s and 30s who actively harassed people in video games. Phrases like: I hope you die from cancer or other acts of making people feel miserable, seem to be a common thing nowadays. How can one justify such a behavior? Dominance over others to compensate for their own insecurities? Fun?\n\nSome seem to forget that there are real people behind the avatars with real feelings, this behavior is an absolute mystery to me. I would like to know your subjective opinion about this topic. Did you experience it yourself? Or are you even a so-called cyber-bully and can justify this?\n\nEdit: thank you all for the replies and sharing your thoughts with me. For those who think I’m whining about harassment, no. I’ve never experienced being harassed online myself. The purpose of this post was to get a view from other people’s perspectives, it’s called curiosity. ",

        "text": "&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Now, let me start with a disclaimer that while I think porn-games worthy their own debate, I'm more interested into bringing the discussion to genres where eroticism isn't usually believed to be the main focus.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; And second, I know this has the chance of becoming a shit-storm, so... let's try not to. And since I'm a guy, i'll approach this from a specific angle, but there is no denying that Adam Jensen is a hunk of a man.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The more I look at Street Fighter V female characters, the more I'm fascinated to how the art team was able to create such enticing females. Lately, even the guys at Netherrealm are cranking some beautiful sexy ladies (something they always aimed to, but weren't really that sucessful in most of their 3D games) \n  \n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In a way, the vast majority of fighting games feature some absurdly beautiful female characters, showing a good amount of the skin, to the point that it would be weird to see a fighting game where eroticism doesn't play a part. But, do you think this influences you in buying a game? Or is \"let's make them as hot as possible\" something carried over from other medias that may not necessarily affect the outcome of games as much?  \n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Back in the day, when they asked a Heavy Metal (the magazine) Editor why the magazine always had naked/uber sexy ladies on the cover, he simply stated \"those who don't have sell way less\".\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; And this is a tricky matter in my opinion, while I will admit (sorry, haha) that I've always felt that some games go 'full-erotic' and this sort-of pushes me away (dead or alive is an example, I don't feel like buying it). I won't deny that despite what I consciously say or \"believe I think\", the beautiful ladies of Injustice played a whole in me buying it, so did the ones in Street Fighter V. They don't make me think the game is the \"best of the best\".\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; But at the same time, I really don't care about sex scenes in games and I think eroticism out of place can ruin a game (Metal Gear Solid 4, imho). But at the same time, I think there is a \"underlayer\" of eroticism in games that people don't even realize. Overwatch is a great example of this.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Have you guys/girls ever wondered this?  If for whatever reason, games that usually feature very sexy characters stopped doing so, how much this would affect your enjoyment? If you had to look at your own gaming history, how much do you think eroticism played a role in the games you play?",

Typically, I'll only play 6 or 7 hours during the week and a little bit more here and there on the weekends due to work and personal obligations, which makes this all the more disheartening to me as I've invested quite a bit of time even getting as far as I have (spending time grabbing collectibles, etc.).\n\nFor those of you who have been in my shoes, what did you ultimately do? Did you jump right back in? Take some time off and play something else? Did you drop the game and never come back to it? I was really enjoying the game up to this point, but I'm feeling frustrated (and maybe even a little bit anxious) about doing it all over again. I feel like I'm probably overthinking the whole thing as it is, which is another issue entirely, but I'd be interested to hear what others who are into gaming think about healthy ways to deal with this kind of disappointment and frustration.\n\nEdit: This got way more attention than anticipated! Thank you all for commiserating with me about game breaking bugs. I ended up powering through the first half of Tomb Raider again, and made it to the next section without a hitch!",

Developers need feedback to ensure that the product their making would meet consumers demands and because of that many gamers want their voices to be heard but as we all know the saying, the consumers always right, I feel many gamers have abused this phrase to the T. Now look I understand some developers need to be taking down a notch with Microtransactions, day DLCs and patches being abused to soak as much money from consumers but when it comes to others, why do gamers have the need to think they are above developers when a game is not made a certain way. They think insulting staff members, sending death threats and shout unrealistic demands is a form of criticism but when developers fire back they are deemed the bad guys because they can’t take on quote criticism. It’s no lie, trolls get away with harassing devs but devs are punished because they  are seen as professionals and even though they are, we forget that they are humans and not robot to blast out whatever game we desire but if they rebel they are seen as too sensitive or soyboys. What exactly is criticism now, why should devs listen to us if we don’t know what we want. I not defending devs but I don’t want there to continue being this stereotype that the gaming community is a toxic place and many to be devs leaving their fields because they can’t handle the climate.",

        "text": "Let me first say that I'm looking at this entirely through rose tinted glasses. When I was younger there wasn't really a concept of DLC, thus there was no concept of a game feeling incomplete, a game was just a game the same way a movie is a movie. The closest thing I remember was warcraft and starcraft expansions and SF games being rereleased/updated.\n\nNow that dlc exists and is expected, my perception of games has been altered and I don't think there's really anything that can be done about it. Games feel cheaper.\n\nNow, I know not all games have dlc, and indie games are typically better about this. Hell I don't even buy a lot of games that come out, or even buy dlc! If anything I get a GOTY edition years after. But even when I do this, I feel like the dlc either adds little or isn't really worth much (when talking about single player content). They have to be designed to take place within the game but also be entirely negligible. Even when dlc is just purely aesthetic and cheap, not worth buying at all, it still effects how I perceive games.\n\nI'm not sure how to word exactly how I feel. I'm not necessarily making a complaint against DLC. It's just that, the fact that any game can have things added to it, or things taken out and put behind a paywall, has cheapened games as a whole medium in my mind. A single game isn't a guaranteed solitary experience. I like that I can look back at older games and they're somewhat pristine. Not that they're perfect, but that they are exactly what they are. They made that game and made mistakes, and corrected some while adding new things in the sequel. Now a game comes out and maybe it's broken on day one, or maybe you don't have all the content right away. I don't really need to have all the content, but knowing that there's content unavailable to me unless I pay a certain amount, or that there will likely be content added later that I will probably not play has an overall effect on how I feel about the game.\n\nI'm fully aware that this feeling is also likely a combination of many things, maturing, controlling my own money, having less time, and also being so close to gaming media for so long. I know the whole situation of the game before it comes out. How people reacted when it was announced, any news that was revealed, any dlc that was announced or already planned. It's possible the magic is gone because I'm so used to looking behind the curtain to find out what I'm supposed to be paying $60 for.\n\nThis was mostly just venting, but what do you guys think?

Or that they wouldn't have  to face criticism for being adults who still play Pokemon and other weird stuff. Not just on the internet but even in real life! I wish I was making it up but I remember growing up in the 90s how many classmates was saying how awesome living in Japan would be because its the country that created Pokemon, FF7, the Gameboy, etc and they want to find much higher competition than in the US, etc because we as kids seem to think Japan was the center of gaming and gaming was so mainstream adults played it (since we saw on TV of Japanese adult gamers dominating the multiplayer scene back than).\n\nI'm curious looking back now how accurate this perception is? And mind you a lot of us as kids also thought Japan was a media paradise for cartoons, comics, martial arts, and action movies so I'm really interested to hear the input of gamers who actually lived there! Not just in regards to gaming but if possible in regards to other things Japan is known to to be popular for such as anime/manga, martial arts, action movies, etc!\n\nCan gamers (especially those who lived in Japan) give their input?\n\nIs the notion of Japan being a gamer's paradise accurate?

I get all warm inside when I hear people talking about LaMulana and how it's a game where you need to draw maps and anotations...  \n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; But honestly? All this goes out of the window pretty fast when I get lost in Doom (2016) Foundry Level and don't know where the blue keycard is. Then I proceed to expend 15 minutes walking back and forth trying to find the damn key...\n \n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Some games try to give us a middle ground solution, waypoints show us the \"general vicinity\" of the objective, like Final Fantasy XV. And this is all fine and dandy, but the moment I expend 15 minutes circling back and forth trying to find where the hell that wounded hunter is, that's it... \n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Now, this is in no way me blaming these games. Maybe I just suck at navigating spaces. but for the huge amount of complaint that waypoints, objective markers and whatnot get. I think games are way more frustrating without them, or trying to be \"general\" in the approach.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Don't get me wrong, I love to walk around a game world without destination and simply let the ambience sink in. I love to explore corners and unmarked territories. But the moment I'm pumped to see the next part of the storyline, or to finish a side-quest, and all I'm doing is circling around the same area for 10-20 minutes... I really start missing gigantic arrows pointing me to the exact place I'm supposed to be.  \n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; But what do you guys feel about this?

        "text": "We've come leaps and bounds graphically when it comes to video games. Not even from Wolfenstein 3D and Doom to the present, but even games from a few years ago are starting to appear aged. I first noticed this when I was watching an ultra settings benchmark from Rise of the Tomb Raider, and I was amazed at its visuals. I looked up a video of 2013 Tomb Raider's ultra settings benchmarked, and although it still looks pretty good, RotTR, which came out just a few years later, blows it out of the water. I wouldn't be surprised if this is partly due to it being designed on previous-generation hardware, as many other franchises had a similar graphical overhaul when the current generation was released; Wolfenstein comes to mind as a good example. But I wonder, will there ever be a point in our lifetimes when graphics, even pushed to their absolute limit, will stop improving? Or is it bound to forever continue to improve?",

Even Hollow Knight, a metroidvania, clocks in at about 40 hours!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne obvious problem is that many of us have more games that interest us, than time to play them. But I was recently playing Dragon Age Inquisition and I loved it. My first playthough was about 90 hours with all the DLC. There are several classes to play as, and many gamplay decisions that can affect the story which begs for multiple playthroughs. I got through half of a second playthrough but then stopped after about 140 hours total. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wish I could have fit several playthoughs in that time to experience more before I burned out and moved on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think it would be easier for developers and gamers if some games had a tighter story line, or even some chunks removed.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/9ax9n1/is_the_term_video_game_way_too_broad/",
        "text": "So as it stands, gaming is a mainstream hobby finally. However, what does this hobby entail? People call it “interactive entertainment” but with the way so many games differ, it really makes you second guess if it’s a hobby in itself. I feel it should be seen as multiple hobbies put in one broad medium. Like movies, documentaries and TV are classified “video” and collectible statues and LEGO go under “toys”.\n\nI wonder why we have sites like IGN and Polygon, which look at gaming as a whole but not sites that look exclusively under “single player campaigns” and “simulators”? At least popular ones.\n\nHere’s how I think things should be categorised:\n\n1. Interactive Movie: I see this term thrown around as a derogatory for games with too much of a focus on “story”. Well look at it this way, Detroit Become Human has as much gameplay and interactivity as an RPG like Dark Souls. It’s just *conveyed differently*. In Detroit, you spend your time by day talking and using speech, actions etc. to resolve conflict. Just as much as beating up monsters in dungeons. You still have to find things and choose what to say.  Single player campaigns with storytelling goes in this field. \n\n2. Role-Playing Video Games: These are basically expansive “interactive movies”. Like a film to a TV episode. We probably know how an RPG works so I won’t go too in depth but these are more so virtual worlds with a story arc.\n\n3. Virtual Sport: This goes into competitive multiplayer mainly. Basically, sports like baseball are just like Overwatch and League of Legends. You practice and possibly go to the big leagues with an audience of millions. These have no story for a reason. A backdrop exists, just like Bionicles and My Little Pony but the main game (and progression) is getting “better” and becoming amazing.\n\n4. Simulator: A main focus on being as realistic as possible, to be an alternative to the real thing.\n\n5. Virtual world: these are very few due to the sheer scope of one. Basically a completely secondary life from IRL. Yes that includes Second Life. I find it hard to count WoW and Destiny regardless of being MMOs, they start as an “interactive movie” for way too many hours. A good example is Fallout 76. The game puts you in a world that you can literally live in. Properties, jobs await. The players are responsible with what happens in these worlds.\n\nOverall, there is so many variables to video games that the word “gamer” and “gaming” is probably just as broad as “watching” and “reading”. People argue games as an “art form”. But I feel devs are creating worlds as “software” to become immersed in. This doesn’t apply to Interactive Movies and Role Playing games cause that’s what they are, art forms. Just like movies. I just can’t say the same for Virtual Sports and Simulators.\n\nNow to you guys, how do you feel about the term “video game”? Is it possible and better off to categorise these 5 categories (or whatever you can think of) as entirely seperate mediums?",

        "author": "el2mador",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/9ax6gm/constructive_criticism_and_laughing_at_jokes/",
        "text": "Some time ago, I posted [this discussion here on r/truegaming](https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/878egr/discussion_a_look_at_how_outrage_echo_chambers/). Thanks to many of you fine gentlemen and ladies who joined in, the topic gained a lot of traction and I think we had a great discussion all around.\n\nThat brings me to another discussion. This one falls in line with how we criticize games on the internet, and how well we take satire/jokes when they happen. Please note that the post will be a bit long and detailed, and will be citing several examples.\n\nThis is also partly related to the previous topic about \"outrage culture and echo chambers\" when we're online. That's because you might notice how various communities follow a particular trend:\n\n- People are happy/neutral, therefore those who are unhappy form a smaller subset\n- People become unhappy, therefore those who are happy/neutral become the smaller subset\n\nIn both situations, there is an idea to shun those with opposing views. However, it's more noticeable when communities are on a \"downward trend.\" That usually happens when a game has some disappointments or a content drought. Players become angry, which then leads to outrage, which then makes them more hostile to those with differing views, or to developers themselves.\n\nKind of like what an indie developer mentioned about how [\"Developers are not being candid towards gaming communities\"](https://twitter.com/charlesrandall/status/911987526541430784) -- because communities can become sour and toxic due to outraged gamers. Feel free to read the Twitter thread.\n\n-----------------\n\n**What does this have to do with criticism and jokes?**\n\nThat's because I've noticed that gamers nowadays confuse \"constructive criticism\" with \"being angry and bringing out the pitchforks.\" Whether it's harassing developers, or ostracizing other gamers, or just reducing conversations to banal terms.\n\nA good example would be:\n\n&gt; \"Let's discuss monetization in games.\"\n\n- You could have a dozen people talk about what they like/dislike as well as improvements. This is a great, informative, and open discussion where we share ideas.\n- Yet all it takes is for one random user to pop up and say: \"THIS IS GREEDY, SICK, MANIPULATIVE, AND THEY ARE ABUSING GAMERS!\" -- that automatically fans the flames and pretty soon that gains traction.\n\nPsychologists and researchers often mention [Negativity Bias](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3652533/) -- how negative words/phrases/situations/experiences have a stronger affect on our interactions and reactions.\n\nThe above comes into play because of the words and terms that are used. These elicit strong emotions that lead people to lash out even more.\n\nWe also know of [The Underdog Effect](https://learningtogo.info/2016/05/03/the-psychology-and-neuroscience-of-the-underdog-effect-why-were-all-leicester-city-football-fans/) -- and why people like to root for the underdog or the \"unlikely hero.\"\n\nIn terms of internet conversations, this is when someone presents himself/or a group as those who have been \"abused, maligned, manipulated, and have grown sick and tired, and want to be heard\" -- all against an \"evil, faceless, corrupt, and greedy entity.\"\n\nIn gaming -- this is when a gamer rises up to face the evil corporation. The good old \"Little Guy fighting against the Establishment.\"\n\nCriticism gets twisted because rather than focus solely on a game's mechanic, you suddenly add layers to the conversation. From focusing simply on \"here's what I think would be great\" -- we suddenly end up with a \"rallying cry\" or a \"crusade.\"\n\n--------------\n\n**Okay, so what about jokes?**\n\nWhenever I see communities suddenly become up-in-arms, I watch and analyze behaviors. I notice a pattern of people becoming more agitated the more frustrations from other people are mentioned. Psychology tells us that it's normal for us to look for validation -- and so if you feel angry about something, you seek the validation or someone who feels the same way.\n\nIt snowballs until a very vocal subset becomes an angry mob.\n\n-- And then I poke fun at that. --\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause I am, what you would call, a very fun-loving person. I'm in my mid-30s, a family man, who rarely gets bothered by the internet. I never get angry \"because of video games\" -- at least not since I was in my teens and Sephiroth killed Aeris.\n\nI try to find humor in these things because, at the end of the day, video games are meant to be fun and entertaining. We are meant to have lighthearted and enjoyable discussions. Even if, say, a game has problems, it's as easy as presenting our criticism, and waiting for results. If we achieve those results -- great. If not -- then we simply avoid buying future products. Simple as that.\n\nI've always felt that \"criticism --&gt; turning people into an angry internet mob\" is such a silly occurrence that I cannot help but poke fun when these things happen. I satirize it. I joke about it. I don't poke fun at \"specific people\" -- rather, I poke fun at \"caricatures\" -- *exaggerated* instances.\n\nMy goal was to simply tell gamers:\n\n- Guys, settle down. Leave the anger out for a minute. Get the frustrations out. Relax and look at the situation.\n- Do you see how worked up you're getting... because of a video game?\n\n----------\n\n**Here are some sample satire posts:**\n\n- [This is from Destiny where I poke fun at the things that make it to the front page](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/7yjjdd/a_guide_to_rdestinythegames_guaranteed_ways_to/)\n- [This is also from Destiny where I made a \"story\" about a very \"passionate\" Guardian](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/7yjjdd/a_guide_to_rdestinythegames_guaranteed_ways_to/)\n- [This one is from Total War where I satirized a post about Red Shell](https://old.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/8q4zqg/psa_total_war_games_have_spies_integrated_into/)\n\nIn this third example, [a user said](https://old.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/8q4zqg/psa_total_war_games_have_spies_integrated_into/e0gz7kw/):\n\n&gt; Boy, making light of a serious issue sure is a wonderful way to make people less pissed about it. Good job! \n\nAnd so my reply was:\n\n&gt; That’s because not everything on the internet needs to be a crusade. If that were the case, we’d already have Medieval 3: Total War.\n\n\nThis one, meanwhile, is from another user -- u/ItsOtisTime -- from r/TotalWar. He made a meme/comic about [Weekly Reminders about bug fixes](https://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/995kmu/weekly_reminder_that_these_weekly_reminders_about/).\n\nAnd yes, users who were already angry about the game/s also became angrier because these satire/joke posts \"made fun of anger.\"\n\n- They felt it was demeaning, that it was diminishing their views.\n- They considered it offensive that they were being made fun of.\n- They felt so strongly about these issues and so poking fun at them was not welcome. It was akin to \"silencing their voice.\"\n\nI've spoken with Otis as well and we both agreed that poking fun at these things aren't meant to be offensive to \"specific people,\" because we're simply finding humor at the \"situation\":\n\n**That people are so worked up and frustrated because of video games.**\n\n-----------\n\n**Criticism vs. Jokes about games and game criticism:**\n\nSo allow me to wrap-up this already lengthy and boring post. I'm not an angry person by nature. While I know that anger is an important emotion, it's something that I never want to dwell on.\n\nIn past relationships and friendships, whenever problems surface, there are two ways I go about it:\n\n- Have a civil and mature discussion\n- Add some jokes in between to lighten the mood\n\nAnd yet, at this present climate on the internet, where it seems a lot of people are often outraged by anything and everything -- [and we've already discussed how \"Outrage is contagious and brings pleasure\"](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/domestic-intelligence/201803/the-dangerous-pleasures-outrage) -- it seems people are also averse to humor, finding more things to be offended by.\n\nIn a way, I feel that these frustrations and anger are so ingrained in some players that these emotions are already nestled within their personas.\n\n----------\n\n**What about you guys?**\n\n- Do you feel strongly about issues in video games?\n- Do you still find ways to poke fun and have humor when discussing these things?\n- Or do you feel offended if people make fun of various situations?\n\nThanks for reading and joining in.\n\n-- EL2\n\n------------\n\n**As a side note, I'd like to mention a recent topic I did as well:**\n\n[This one from Total War](https://old.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/9ae3ja/a_friendly_reminder_that_the_sub_shouldnt_be_an/) was about having decent discussions and moving away from echo chambers. As you can see, a number of people did not like it. Apparently, using Psychology to explain certain human behaviors was... well... condescending (oh well).\n\nSeveral users said that I was *\"demeaning and belittling people.\"* Around the same time, I was also being told that I'm *\"autistic, retarded, should kill myself, should shut the fuck up, do not belong in any community, coming from a trash heap country, and so on.\"* Zoinks!\n\nPerhaps the funniest aside I can find there regarding **\"criticism, taking offense, and humor\"** comes from one of the commenters:\n\n&gt; User: \"I think it is uncivil and offensive for people to joke about the bugs we want to get fixed.\" (+ upvotes)\n\n&gt; Me: \"Didn't you tell me before that I'm autistic and mentally-retarded?\" (- downvotes)\n\n&gt; User: \"That was 'dark humor' and it's 'normal on the internet.'\" (+ upvotes)\n\nYes -- there were literally players who were *\"offended by a joke about video game bugs\"* -- who were happily upvoting *\" jokes about autism and mental illness\"* -- because it was *\"dark humor and normal on the internet.\"*\n\nI was honestly flabbergasted that I literally facepalmed at how people could take grave offense at something (*\"video game jokes\"*), and then happily laugh about something else -- that we can universally agree on -- is more serious (*\"mental health\"*).\n",

        "text": "Yes, I admit the graphics and world look gorgeous, but that's not all there is to a game. Here's my issues with what I saw:\n\n- The move to 1st person in my opinion was strange, especially given the emphasis on character creation (i.e. wouldn't we want to see what we created  in more than just cutscenes? Seeing some derpy chartacer doing some really cool combat scenarios would make for some funny streams. Idk, just a thought)\n\n- The combat was nothing special. This looked like a step down from The Witcher's intense CQC. It's just a shooter now, trying to blend into the 50 other shooters that release each year. The chemical that slowed down time was not as innovative as they wanted us to believe. Horizon Zero Dawn and BotW are a few that I'm thinking of that already implement this feature, and it wasn't something they heavily marketed. \n\n- It is suspect to a re told story. Granted, we only saw one hour's worth of gameplay, but I was getting the generic vibes of a \"we're oppressed lower class who want to show the upper tiers of society a thing or two\" story. \n\n- The commentator used the classic phrases \"seamless open world\" \"immersion\" \"deep progression\" which are really just filler words considering these are never not used, not a huge problem per se, just annoying\n\n- Lastly (perhaps my personal biggest issue) Why so dark? Seriously, I know it's the current trend, but every single AAA \"seamless open world \" coming out nowadays has to depict cities where crime is rampant, people curse every other word, no one trusts one other, etc. One could argue that this is an attempt to over exaggerate our own society, but I think more companies should take a clue from Nintendo and produce high caliber games that bring pure joy to players, not pure edgyness\n\nAll this being said, I know CDPR is working insanely hard on this and I hope they prove me wrong.\n\nThis will probably get shot down, but I feel it had to be said.\n\nTL;DR It looks like another open world game with some good graphics and a fancy world, hope it's more than that.\n\nEdit: Don't take my \"Darkness in games\" complaint too seriously, I hadn't given much thought to the source material, I guess I just personally would like to see more upbeat games",

The mods really aren't that competent at coding so there's a lot of issues with the server(let's just say i drop to 20fps with a fucking ryzen 5 1600.) and I constantly raging out with bugs on the server and I think it's enabling my already bad anger problems. Today it so bad I literally wanted to kill myself (also probs enabling my suicidal urges) and had to grab my arms to hold in the suicidal urge and burning rage. I still feel pretty terrible. \n\nThey also always force you to be on teamspeak while on the server (ones of the mods told me shut up\"when I complained that maybe I just wanna not be on there for once but that's getting off point) and everyone's older than me and I can't really connect with anyone and even feel like I'm getting ignored. I try so hard to be cool with them but it dosen't work and I know they truly don't give a shit about me. \n\nNow I know it seems like an easy to decision to just tell them to fuck off and quit, but I'm actually really scared to do it. I mean, this is all I've done with my free time for the past five years. This is what I'm so comfortable with and know. Just leaving that honestly shakes me to my core. Once I quit, it's all gone. Will I be able to recover after realizing I wasted so much time for nothing? What will I do with myself after I do it? \n\nAnd here's another problem: I've already left the server a couple times before, but I always coming back like a magnet because I don't know anything else to do. So to end this once and for all, I'm thinking about breaking a crucial rule to get myself permanently banned. This would force me to change my ways, but I could never ever go back. I'm worried I'll be filled with regret after my choice. I'm losing a lot of what I considered friends and what has been part of my childhood for so long. Things in my life have alreayd changed so much, would I really be okay with somethink like this? \n\nI don't know what to do. I really need your advice on this /r/truegaming. Thank you. ",

        "text": "I sometimes wonder why there aren’t more video games out there that use fourth wall breaking as a central element of all or part of the game. I mean, there’s a lot of fourth wall breaking when it comes to inserting humour into a game but there doesn’t seem to be a lot that use it for plot purposes\n\nI can only think of two mainstream examples of what I’m trying to think of. Spoilers obviously just in case the spoiler tag doesn’t come up\n\n· The Psycho Mantis battle in Metal Gear Solid where he literally reads your memory card, controls the vibration on the controller and can predict your every move unless you put your controller in slot 2\n\n· The ending of Earthbound. The game gives you two opportunities to enter your real name during the game, which I thought would just be used as a personalised thank you at the end. But it actually turns out that the name is used to save Ness and defeat Giygas (the final boss). I guess the idea behind it was that because experienced the same journey as Ness, you are the one who gives all of his strength so that Giygas can be defeated when all hope seems lost and everything else seems to fail. It was definitely one of my favourite endings I’ve had to a video game I’ve played\n\nIt just seems funny to me that video games are such an interactive medium and yet this is a concept that hasn’t been explored as much as it has. It’s probably something that’s more suited to the indie space but I guess depending on how deep you want to go with the concept it could be a programming nightmare.\n\nThoughts on this? Am I in the minority here or do you think a game could be successful using fourth wall breaks?\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all the responses so far. It’s occurred to me that my gaming history has been way narrower then I thought. It wasn’t that games don’t use this concept, it was just in genres I haven’t really looked at much. Keep the responses coming and I’ll see if I can discuss some of those soon.",

        "text": "Since I unintentionally violated rules, I'm rewriting my recent post, this time not focusing on fanservice and focusing on more specific things.\n\nFor those who didn't read my original version asking this question, first read this (since I also linked it in the original question and it goes hand in hand with the overall topic I'm asking about).\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/99xag9/why_is_gaming_standards_for_artistic_elements/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=truegaming&amp;utm_content=t3_9ahkzp\n\nI notice in contrast to how gaming tends to lag behind in storytelling, art direction and music one area they could keep up with movies and other mediums (even having surpassed anime and comics in since the 2000s) is HOW they portray accurate human features and human expressions as well as human movements in 3D character models and movements.\n\nFor example, the amount of subtleties shown in Virtua Fighter for showing stuff like what part of the leg to lower and how to tilt your back when throwing karate punches not only amazes just me but even real life professional martial artists.\n\nTo avoid commenting on subjective opinions on good looks, I'm just gonna state that since DOA5 they've shown very subtle differences that you typically don't see in comics and anime such as how Hitomi has slightly more slender but also more toned arms than Kasumi, how Rachel's body is so muscular she can qualify as a bodybuilder and showing specific sculpted features of her body,  and so much more subtle stuff you normally don't see in cartoons and comics.\n\nI mean even strictly fantasy games today such as the new Zelda has drawn Link looking so real that I wouldn't be surprised if I saw a person in town with a similar face. And series that use a typical anime art style such as Darkstalkers at least attempted to draw their cast's in-game portraits and even sprites relatively realistic to games using similar art direction.. Compare Morrighan in the first Darkstalker and her incarnation in Darkstalker 3 as an example.\n\n\nNot just that but even non-fanservice people like say your average marine in the original Halo look similar like real life commercials of some US Army recruiting I seen and the Wolfenstein 3D even shown some very subtle physical movements such as accurate facial expression when a Nazi gets stabbed and the surprised reaction on the face of surprised agents who detected you as far as the first Splinter Cell game resembles those of actors playing as mooks in many Hollywood spy flicks.\n\nWhere as compare to how mooks express getting gunned down in anime or how Marvel comics show inaccurate depiction of how an arm looks like when throwing a boxing hook, gaming has already shown as close to possible basic movements like flinching and throwing a jab since the old 4D Boxing!\n\nSo my question is, why did gaming not only emphasized realism from its early days in regards to character modeling and physical movements, but today even are almost close to live action in portraying accurate movements and human physical features from dunking exactly like real NBA players to showing how different one person's eye brows is from another (even if they appear the same), and even accurately showing realistic facial reaction from being surprised you saw a monster in the closet to expressing pain from being hit with a bat?\n\nHow come other non-live action entertainment works such as comics, anime/manga, and cartoons don't bother accurately showing how a bat should be swung or the subtle leg movements used in ice skating? Or even basic stuff such as like a more fit person has arms that are more toned even if he's as slender as his sidekick??\n\nWhy did gaming traditionally put so much effort into realistic character models and animation, even in recent years attempting to capture how realistic a person's hair would flow from the wind or lip movements in talking and even how a foot would contract and react from standing vs crouching vs sitting vs squatting?",

        "text": "Lately I played God of War (PS4) on God of War Difficulty. There was this mega-huge scary looking dragon with a big hp bar and many different attack phases. I really loved the scale of the fight and its variety even when it wasn't so hard... \"but wait? It wasn't so hard? even on God of War difficulty?!\"\n\nExactly! One reason of this is, that the bossfight has a fair amount of checkpoints, it isn't the only one but it's one of these fights where I don't think that it really was necessary. The fight for itself would be super cool and challenging, but with restarting from a third of its health bar, while your character starts with full life, feels just unfair... cheap. \n\nA boss fight symbols an fight between 2 opposing forces to me, the stakes should be clear, the fight on its own is one big challenge and obstacle. By restarting inbetween (and with full life) your break up the actual fight in much more reasonable chunks, in that case it's not different than playing just one verse of a piano song (verse by verse) instead the whole song. It doesn't feel like you mastered the song and its transitions, there is just a feeling of \"pew, I'm so glad I'm not forced to this hell of a song/fight all at once\", well that's the easy way out, but like I said, I play on God of War difficulty I actually want a challenge and the game strips me from that challenge.\n\n\nThere are several bosses in God of War who do this, sometimes it's not even predictable when you reach such an checkpoint, at example that teleporting troll on Helheim. I was really disappointed to see where I start after my first try.\n\nBut not only God of War does this, there are many games with spectacular fights where they just put checkpoints in between so that your potential of frustration is lowered, but what do I gain from it in exchange? \nA shall and hollow victory a feeling that I actually doesn't deserve the win... Everyone can beat every task when you split it in small and smaller parts, the point is to play consistently good not just until that artificial waymark.\n\nIt's not only that it kills the whole idea of one single fight between you and the boss it also takes away the immersion, when you respawn in the middle of the fight, I get a strong disconnect between my character and me as the player. The feeling of satisfaction, beating a strong force, by your own wits or skill, your own hp bar as some sort of ressource through the whole fight, were always strong points of boss fights to me, they are more than just a addition for variety, in many games they represent a test of skill and knowledge, they are your strongest foes, but at the same time they act as guides they remind you why you love the game and its mechanic so much and help you to understand it better (when they are well implemented)\n\nI know those with several phases can take a lot of time and the throwback can be ginormous, but if that's the case I think developers should be clever enough to design the fights exciting enough that there lenght is justified, one good example to me for that is Furi.\nIt's a game where the room for mistakes is big enough that the fights could take a while, you can't really die in that game just mere second cause you got hit unlucky, by an unpredictable attack. You will see your mistakes and the build up to your lose is clearly indicated.\nGod of War on God of War difficulty has some bosses which can kill you in seconds, Magni and Modi for example so I understand the reason why they where making checkpoints. But instead of placing checkpoints in an unforgiveable fight they could remodel the boss in that fashion that it's better balanced for a full fight. It would be so much more exciting then just trying to reach the next third of their life bar.\n\nIf a boss has several forms, where you start from the last than its important to me that the game clearly communicates to me that this are two different fights, at example by a small break between these two, so I could at least understand why there were checkpoints for the phases of the stranger (you actually deplete his health bar 3 times)\n\nWhat do you think, are you annoyed by long boss fights? Do you think checkpoints are a must at some point or are they completely avoidable? Imagine some of your favourite bossfights with multiple phases in games and no checkpoints...Ok, now add checkpoints to them, would the fight loses it's tension?\nI did this for myself (Friede in Dark Souls 3) and my answer is clearly, yes!\n\n\n",

        "text": "&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Now, many games feature upgrade systems, this is a common trope in gaming. But MGSV did some really special things: Many upgrades cut a huge chunk of the repetitive tasks. Specially the Fulton upgrades and the Speed upgrades.  \n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The Fulton System starts as something very laborious: you gotta take enemies into the open, individually tag them to be fultoned up, rinse and repeat.   \n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Midway thru the game, some of your buddies can help you with that, so you don't need to tag every single unconscious enemy, you still need to bring them to open areas tho.  \n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;By the end of the game, you can unlock the wormhole fulton, and with that you can use fulton's indoors and with the help of a buddy, in less than 20 seconds you can easily fulton more than 6 enemies.  \n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; And all of that is optional, so if you aren't really bothered by the repetition, you can just skip this upgrade part and follow another one.    \n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  \n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Another upgrade path, and my favorite honestly is the movement speed: As you upgrade it, your character becomes faster and faster, to the point of running almost as fast as the Horse/Some Vehicles. Meaning you can go from objective to objective way faster, don't really need to use the horse anymore (unless you want it) and the experience of crossing the terrain, that by now is very well known and could start feeling like a chore, is less present because you can simply do it faster.\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  \n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  \n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Open World games are full of things I really enjoy, but after 30/60/90 hours repeating the same thing over and over again, the more consuming/less rewarding aspects can become a chore and weight down the game.   \n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  By adding upgrades that allow the player to do those tasks fasteras the game progresses, the experience can really be improved. Specially if the player can \"choose\": don't really enjoy that anymore? Get some points/cash/whatever doing something you enjoy, and pay to \"speed it up\".\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  \n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  \n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  I've been playing Mafia 3 lately, and some missions ask you to destroy valuables and steal cash, usually in very guarded areas. And I'm starting to feel really tired of doing these... Now, the game would be way more enjoyable at this state, if it had a simple system where if you killed all enemies in an area, you call a wrecking crew to simply trash everything (and keep the cash they find). With this system:\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; a) You can choose to ignore enemies, destroy/steal the things and bolt, if you don't really enjoy the combat sections anymore.  \n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; b) You can kill all enemies, if you are still into the combat mechanics, and skip the busywork of finding crates around corners to break. But you lose cash.\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; c) You can only grab the cash, if you either needed it or isn't really that tired of the mechanic, but have the repetitive stuff done for ya.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; But, this is not something I hear a lot about, and isn't really talked that much in MGSV reviews. So, what is your guys opinion?\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ps:  INB4 \"Metal Gear Solid 5 is not really an Open World game\". I agree, but lets save that discussion for another day.\n",

But even playing Bioshock and exploring every corner, none of the jump scares or atmosphere affected me at all. It probably has to do with the fact that the first two Bioshocks look like crap, but I also feel like most horror games lost the fear factor because I played too many of them.\n\nOutlast and Amnesia were both tense, but never scary. I see all these posts about how people are too scared to even continue in these games, but I find that impossible, because if I put down a game for being too scary, then that game was a waste of money. I still do get that tense feeling of being scared or at least incredibly paranoid in games like Dead By Daylight and Friday the 13th, but modern horror games just don't do it for me. Even Resident Evil VII at no point did I feel like I had to hide, even on the hardest difficulty I just died until I found the objective and sprinted there and got out without even encountering the patrolling enemy. Same goes for Outlast when you're being hunted. \n\nIs there any game that actually scares the player in a way where they will actually feel compelled to spend the game hiding in a dark corner? ",

They seem well made overall, worthy to play with friends, but there is a comon point that I see is recurring without anyone thinking twice about it: there are no few &amp; big servers anymore. It's all small home servers like in counter strike or fragmented server layered worlds like some early online games.\n\n\nFor a MMORPG lover like me this is quite unsettling, first because it actually becomes weird to play those games alone. Yes, there are new ways of interacting, like microphone talks and whatever, but since the worlds aren't statics, since you enter a diferent server each time, it's imposible to run through the same people while leveling or farming or pvping again and again. Every time it's a new world with diferent people that will vanish quickly. The social interactions are vague and purely random, and when you find someone worthy of interest, you might never see him/her again if you change servers, or the server closes or reiniciates. This creates a sensation of loneliness, not being able to make friends, **nor enemies** over the gameplay. Of course, for a lot of people not being pushed to interact with stranger is a plus, \"Only friends server, thank you\", but for others, not being able to have a trace on the people of that world or to know people by seeing them play alongside you is a let down.\n\n\nAm I the only one who sees small server games as a destroying path for the true MMORPG game where people had to share a world togheter?",

In the video he shows that around 80% of games shown at E3 for the last 3 years feature combat of some kind. \n\nI don’t think there’s anything necessarily wrong with having combat in games. In fact, most of my favourite games are combat-focused. But that’s exactly my question.\n\n Are so many games combat-focused because combat is simply the most fun form of gameplay. Obviously fun is subjective, but is it a matter of the majority of people finding combat the most fun type of gameplay? Or is there some other reason? Is it simply because conflict is central to most storytelling, and combat is the best way to convey combat in videogames as opposed to, say, dialogue? Is it because combat is historically associated with videogames and modern games are simply following that trend? What do you guys think?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/99xag9/why_is_gaming_standards_for_artistic_elements/",
        "text": "Having just watched the live Prince of Persia movie, I started replaying the games. Years ago I thought Sands of Time had some of the best stories I ever seen not just in gaming but in entertainment in general, falling short just to Final Fantasy and other story driven RPGs and Adventure games. What I saw instead was just a generic fantasy movie at best in plot.\n\nNow I'll grant over the years since I played Prince of Persia, I've been watching so many media and experienced the best of the best across entertainment from The Godfather for movies to DMX's rap songs and Tolkien's Middle Earth to anime classics such as Yu Yu Hakuso and Hokuto No Ken and even the poetry of Robert Frost and Edgar Allen Poe. However I was so blown away as a teen with The Sands of Time story as I play the game I felt it was so average. In fact the whole reason I started replaying the 2000s POP trilogy was because the live action movie felt so underwhelming. It wasn't bad by any means but it wasn't as good as I remembered the games having in terms of story.\n\nIts not just the story though, the artistic direction generally seemed like a standard Arabian Nights movie or TV adaptation from the clothes they wear to the palace design and the voice acting felt so so below the standards of what you get in Saint Seiya and other anime and especially Mulan (which I recently rewatched) and Disney movies in general.\n\nNow not everything is bad. I was pleasantly surprised how well the music aged even compared to other Arabian setting fiction such as Aladdin and while the art direction is generic MidEastern flair, the way the graphics were drawn out made the run of the mill art direction stand out as brighter and more magical than what you get on your typical Arabian Nights TV programming that I literally felt like I'm in another world. The sand particles for example really look so fantastical you feel like you're in The Arabian Nights!\n\nBut thats the point I'm making. I once thought Sands of Time was a masterpiece in every way from the script to the costuming I thought it was superior to stuff like The Last Crusade (which I thought had a so simplistic plot that was typical adventure noir when I was a kid).\n\nHowever when I watched The Last Crusade last year, I was so wowed by the movie despite outdated effects and when I compare it to Sands of Time, the script is far superior as is Harrison Ford's acting. The artistic costuming is generic European design but the cinematography is done in such a way that even the typical Nazi dress gives an awe and the European knight's acting definitely made his costuming more alive.\n\nPractically superior to Sands of Time in almost everyway  and this is one of the weaker Adventure Hollywood classics.\n\nSo this brings my question- how come gaming historically lagged so behind other mediums in basic artistic elements such as character development and camera angles? I mean nowadays gaming costs is so big that even a budget game can incur millions while in cinema you can still work with a few thousand dollars to make a mediocre film. While in gaming, what counts as an above average game often struggles to keep up even with cheap budget genre flicks such as The Convent in acting, special effects, and other artsy stuff.\n\nMass Effect as the best story a modern game has to offer? It came off as a Blade Runner clone with Aliens and Star Wars thrown in. Granted it was quite well executed that I'd put it above your average sci fi novel but Best of the Best? Nowhere close. Mortal Kombat gory and controversial? Dude 60s movies have already experimened with ripping hearts outs and such. The Elder Scrolls outstanding fantasy setting? With the exception of Morrowind, the franchise as a whole comes off as generic Dungeons and Dragons with Peter Jackson influence. And even Morrowind isn't that special in fantasy standards (though it does succeed in feeling like another world that a good fantasy novel evokes).\n\nWhy is this? With the budget and how much time games get for developing, why couldn't someone sing as good as Lea Salonga (Jasmine and Mulan voice singing in Aladdin and Mulan) in video game songs? Or why couldn't we get someone as regal as Ryo Horikawa (Vegeta's Japanese actor) to play as a Roman general in Total War? Why has so few game composers been able to come a few leagues beneath Maurice Jarre (composer of Lawrence of Arabia)? \n\nGaming has the most potential to reach the awe inspiring art that Tolkien has written or Zimmer (from Gladiator)  has composed. But fails to live up to even generic short stories found in magazine.\n\nWhy is this?",

After all, whether you press x or your left mouse button is at most a matter of preference and at least a disadvantage of a stiff forced layout that feels awkward.\nNot to mention all the additional buttons that let us quickly chose specific gadgets in the Batman games, or each menu, just like quick saving and loading.\nYour camera is also a huge problem for me. In Batman, it would frequently get in the way, and you cannot really press x to attack and turn your camera at the same time which is no problem with a mouse. That also allows for movement at least as precise than the stick of your controller.\n\nUnless you use the Steam controller, though I have no experience with that.\n\nSo yeah, this is not supposed to be hate, I just want to understand the site that prefers controllers. \nSo let us discuss!",

        "text": "I would like to take a moment to discuss a game that is almost completely unknown. it is so unknown that even in discussions of DS/SNES hidden gems it isn't brought up very often. I am talking about the game \"Mystery Dungeon: Shiren The Wanderer\", which I have played continuously over the past ten years. Considering the success of the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon games, I find it very surprising that the big brother of these games is practically unknown despite having been around since the early 90s and even receiving a port for the biggest selling handheld of all time.\n\nThe game revolves around the same mechanics of the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon games, except it is FAR more unforgiving. This game is brutally difficult, yet addictive. In true roguelike/dungeon crawler fashion, the game features permadeath, so you must start from the beginning if you die. And believe me, you will die a LOT. The game has been criticized for its difficulty, but I find the difficulty to be the primary selling point for the game. Its so exciting to make it to a point in the game that is further than you have ever been, and heartbreaking to die shortly after, but this is what gives the player the incentive to try again and again. As said earlier, i've been playing for ten years, but I have only made it to the end once. that is how hard the game is. But despite the difficulty, I have had a blast trying over and over, getting further each time.\n\nThere is virtually no story whatsoever in the game, which heightens its feeling of \"Pick up and play\" without having to become invested in the plot and requiring your full attention. There are many side-plots that are unimportant, but still fun to play through, and occasionally unlock a new area.\n\nThe overall aesthetic of the game is excellent, focusing on Feudal Japan, and referencing its gods, and culture often. If you like this type of JRPG imagery, then you will probably like the game.\n\nThis is a game that is so unknown that I cannot find any sort of online fanbase for it, which puzzles me. was the game marketed poorly? probably considering that I only found it because my mother thought I might like it due to the \"Mystery Dungeon\" label. Have any of you played through this game? what were your thoughts on it? If you haven't played, then I strongly recommend you do",

        "text": "Watching Assassin's Creed Odyssey's [early gameplay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnLNmbf_ikE), I've found out that in the English language version, characters speak English with a strong Greek accent when they are supposed to speak in their own mother tongue. Apparently, it was the same thing in Origins (Bayek and many others have a kind of Nigerian accent, probably trying to copy an old Egyptian accent), or AC2 (with an Italian accent) and AC1 (with an Arabian accent, but the main characters had a strong American accent). It seems to be the same thing in other games, such as [Shogun 2: Total War](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjA9V1Vn2TE) (shamefur dispray!). Countless hordes of German soldiers have to speak with a ridiculous accent in many WW2 games.\n\nAC Unity was different, as everyone had a British accent instead of a French one. Likewise, Romans and Barbarians in Rome 2: Total war spoke with an American accent. It's usually the same way [in films](https://youtu.be/0F5zEHVl3tE?t=1h10m28s) set in foreign historical settings. \n\nAs a Frenchman, I play these games in French. In the French version, every character supposed to speak in his mother tongue speak French as a native speaker would. To me, the English voice acting of these games feels a bit immersion breaking, almost comical, because a Greek/Egyptian/Italian/Arab speaking in his own language shouldn't remind me of an immigrant trying to speak a foreign language (whereas it was perfectly logical for Niko Bellic to have a Serbian accent in GTA 4).\n\nEspecially to native English speakers: do these foreign accents break or hinder your immersion? For an American or Canadian player, was it weird to play a Frenchman with a British accent? Is it unavoidable in English due to this language's many accents?",
