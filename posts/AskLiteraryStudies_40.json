Now I have a pretty good grasp of both the story and the character but the specific questions I've been given to answer are throwing me for a loop.  Here they are:\n\nHow do Sammy's actions reveal his character?  In what ways are his thoughts and actions at odds with each other?\n\nMy first problem is that I don't really think Sammy has many \"actions\" throughout the story.  The only real action he has or does is him quitting.  How that's at odds with his thoughts is something I can't really think of.  His thoughts seem to be very in line with this action.  He dislikes the people that work there, the people that shop there, is rebellious and inspired by the girl's rebellion as well.  \n\nAny way you can help me understand what my professor is looking for here would be greatly appreciated.",

I'm going to approach the prof about it soon, but I want to have a healthy potential bibliography compiled before I do.\n\nI guess I'm still working on specifying my area(s) of interest historically, but, in a more theoretical sense, I'm interested in the relationship/interaction between aesthetic problems and social problems, especially as the problems relate to identity and selfhood. Please let me know if you don't know what I mean by that; I'm still unclear on what that means sometime. I'd love to provide a more elaborate explanation, but I'm trying to keep this short.\n\n1. Do any books/articles come to mind that would be of interest to me in this individual study?\n\n2. I don't know that I'm going to get around to an application-type project in this course. I know that I'm going to keep a pretty detailed annotated bibliography, but what other assignments would you suggest for this kind of class that's going to be heavy on reading? Response papers?\n\n3. What should I know before approaching a prof about an unpaid individual study? I know that it won't be a huge time commitment for her, but I just want to make sure that I don't commit any faux pas when requesting her help.\n\nThanks for the help.

The drama was, upon being released, met with great contempt due to its vulgar themes: STD:s, incest and euthanasia being the most shocking. \n\nNow, what is quite shocking to me is why incest and euthanasia are perceived as being so shocking? I mean, incest has been present in drama since Oidipus, has it not? Or was it banned some time? Were dramas with this content not produced on stage during this time? Also euthanasia seems quite mild, I mean we have seen countless ruthless murderers throughout the history of literature, so what makes this special?\n\nI guess STD:s make a little bit sense being taboo (has it been spoken of before? How well known was it even?), and is kind of why I'm making this post, to see if I may be so bold as to claim that this is debatably the \"worst\" of these themes.\n\nLooking forward to hear if you've any insights. I know I presented the question in a rather silly manner, I mean it seems like I'm completely unable to perceive anything in the light of the current times, but I'm really just looking for some more information regarding these themes and the perception of them.

At time Conrad is very sarcastic about racial discrimination and other times he seems pretty sympathetic towards the Africans.

Because they haven't finalised the list; they're refusing to give any information about what might be on it, and since its a new course, I can't look back at the reading list from last year.\n\nI think the course spans 1700 to present, but not 100% sure on that, however for a 12-week course those dates are probably going to fill up a reading list at least. As I say I have no idea what will be on it and I like to be at least a little prepped, so any starting points would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks!",

In particular, I think it might be useful to say what methodologies we're all using, and which ones seem impenetrable or less-than-useful. That's not to encourage argument, but to give some room for those using said methodology to actually chip in and broaden everyone's understanding. My hope is here we'll all pick up something from the resulting discussion.\n\nMy own work features a lot of book history - the focus on both the material aspects of a text as well as the socio-cultural circumstances leading to its creation. Where I'm moving away from the general climate of such studies in this period is relocating the information garnered from consideration of a work's material circumstances back into the context of close reading. That's particularly being carried out through examining the tendency for early modern works to be constructed in an aggregate fashion - multiple works, one material container. How that material 'proximal intertextuality' works on an interpretive level is pretty much my thesis in a nutshell, though there are times I regret taking on quite as big a project as this has turned into!\n\nI'm afraid my critical bugbear is very much psychoanalysis - at least when it's projected back to a period before such things entered into popular discourse. The work I've read using said methods in my period tend to look like very bad attempts to track some deeply questionable Freudian models onto earlier texts. I could well have missed the best work in this field, but I've yet to read something that was really convincing in psychoanalytic criticism. I am, however, more than welcome to get put straight!\n\nDo chip in with your own stuff. Would be nice if we could keep the tone respectful and scholarly! ",

I understand some basic information about that I gleamed off of the Wiki page and some articles pertaining to it I found online, but I feel that I do not fully understand it. What I do know is that Meta-Modernism seems to be a cross between Modernism and Post-Modernism (applying the techniques of PM to the ideas of M or something along those lines) and that MM still takes a post structuralist stance but seems to be more trust based, as a reaction against the irony in PM art. Am I correct in what I believe to be MM? Did I miss anything major? Also can your answers use examples of works of literature?\n\nEdit: I also think that I should tell you what believe the distinction between Modernism and Postmodernism to be.  The main difference on the most basic of levels for me between Modernism and PM is that PM literature takes a more solipsistic philosophy and M has an existentialist philosophy. Am I correct?",

The Judge uses Phrenology to study the head of the idiot's brother.\n\n&gt;The judge reached and took hold of the man‘s head in his hands and began \nto explore its contours…narrowed an eye at the man and studied him and \nthen reached and gripped him again, holding him by the forehead while he \nprodded along the back of his skull with ball of his thumb. (238)\n\nThat's the best quote I could find online (and I don't feel like scrolling through my audiobook for a better one).\n\nSo, my question is, why?  Everything else about the judge seems to be timeless.  He knows everything and approaches godliness.  I might compare him to the Endless in Neal Gaiman's Sandman. That's beside the point though.  Phrenology, as far as I know, is considered to be completely false.  Is there some obscure aspect to it that makes sense in this scene?  Is this McCarthy showing that the judge is fallible?  In a way, it might be the only time the judge is shown to be surprised.\n\nIf he is showing that the judge is fallible, mortal even, and prone to occasional error, does that then suggest that the judge's whole point about war and violence is questionable?  I feel like the philosophy of violence could be a dying view just like phrenology died as well.\n\nI, obviously, am not a literary scholar, and this scene just struck me.  Thank you for listening to my idle musings.  I'm curious what you think.",

Ultimately, I want to end up with a PhD and teach at a university. Pretty standard goals. The process of choosing a concentration or a field in literature kind of mystifies me though. I practically had to invent an area of interest for my statement of purpose. Additionally, when I was choosing classes for this fall my adviser was very clear in stating that I should not be signing up for classes based on these interests at this point. So when and how am I supposed to determine what exactly I will specialize in? Obviously this will depend a lot more on the work I do in a PhD program, but I'm trying to think of what I'll say in my application to PhD programs.\n\nAt the moment I have a very general idea of what periods I'd like to study - to give you an idea of how vague this really is, I'm drawn to the transition in the American novel from realism to modernism, Wallace Stevens, and modernism in a broader sense that includes continental philosophy. These are subjects which I expect to independently pursue over the next two years as I did as an undergraduate, but at what point and with what criteria can I properly assert that these are my planned fields out of which I will right a dissertation? I've read that in order for such claims to be taken seriously, one should have taken a course or two specifically in those areas, but now I'm being instructed not to take courses in my areas of interest. \n\nAt this point I find it much easier to describe what I'm interested in by describing what I'm not interested in: I'm not interested in theories of identity in literature; I'm not interested in commentaries on canonization or cultural capital in academia; I'm not interested in post-colonialism. Do I read as much criticism as possible from the fields which I mentioned above on my own and independently develop a sense of what direction to take? I know I am coming off as a befuddled, naive undergraduate (because I am one), but this has never been explained to me and I'm not getting great results from my adviser when I ask these questions, even though she encouraged me to ask her anything I wanted. I can think of a million interesting questions and ideas based on the literature and criticism I've read, I just don't know which to pursue. Thanks!",

Post an individual comment that stuck out from the rest!\n\n* Full-comment discussions. \n\nEntire threads that you feel display a great debate, discussion, or bibliography on a given topic. This could also include the perennial \"what theory books should I read\"-type threads, or sustained threads on a single topic. \n\n* Overall achievement for a user. \n\nHave you constantly been impressed with someone's answers? This category is a sort of lifelong achievement award for our awesome experts. The candidate does not need to be a flaired user as long as they have contributed at least three comments to the sub.

Literature was always my favourite subject but I can't really score well, either because my analysis isn't deep enough or I can't phrase it well enough. So I was wondering about how I can improve. Is there any techniques, skills, etc on how to write an essay? Maybe the essay should be best structured in a certain way, or  analysing a text/poem should be best done like this, anything to help not only me but others improve. By the way, I am doing basic literature, and writing essays on how the writer creates tension, and analysing the characteristics of a certain person. I am currently studying roll of thunder hear my cry, and am in highschool. Thanks! \n\n\nTL;DR:exams coming help compile a guide to literature essays",

I found it an amazing read and an amazing maze of layers of concepts. \n\nOne thing I missed though, \n\nWhy did the author write such a profound and lengthly explanation about damning the party and big brother and totalitarian society as a whole, if only to have O'Brien turn around and say he wrote it. I get that O'Brien did it to trick Winston, but at the same time, why trick him? He'd already committed thought crime long before he ever got his hands on the book of the brotherhood. What was the point of having him have all that writing against the party if it was going to be brainwashed out of him. I think I'm getting lost lol. \n\nAny help would be great.",

Since his writing was closely linked to the attempt, he gave it up.\n\n-His silence was a conscious work of art.\n\n-He outgrew 'teenage angst'.\n\n-He was shunned by the Paris literary community because of immoral relations with Verlaine and his *l'enfant terrible* reputation.\n\n-He was a materialist at heart and hated being poor and relying on the charity of others.\n\nDo you think there can be a straight answer to this? \n\nWhy do you think he gave it up?",
