I'm editing a piece that includes a sentence that uses the word \"resulted\" this way:  \n\"Major reforms in pollution practices resulted.\"\n\nIt seems to me that \"resulting\" should really be used in a case such as \"resulting in \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" or \"...as a result,\" but I'm not sure whether the sentence I mention is technically wrong or just sounds strange to my ears.\n\nUnder other circumstances, I might rearrange and tack on to the preceding sentence (\"...resulting in major reforms in pollution practices\"), but unfortunately that sentence is already long and fairly complex, and I worry that adding length and complexity would send it over the edge into confusion.\n\nThank you for any help you can give!",
