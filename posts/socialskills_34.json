We worked on a project together last semester so we kind of know each other. I’d like to become better friends with him but I never really catch him at a good time to have a convo. I was thinking talking to through text but I’m kind of awkward and literally have negative texting skills. I don’t want to come as creepy or that I’m interested in him, since I’m a girl. I’m thinking of sending him a funny meme? Or should I just say hi?",

        "text": "Hi. So I'm new here and hoping this sub might be able to give me some advice.\n\nSo a little bit about me, I'm 30 m and was raised in a High Mind Control Cult, known as Jehovah's Witnesses, which I was able to fully escape from last year. This is important I think, because I'm pretty sure it's where my anxiety stems from. In that \"religion\" we were taught that everyone who wasn't a Jehovah's Witness were bad people. People we only deal with on an as needed basis, unless they were studying the Bible in which case some limited socal interaction was acceptable.\n\nI beleive it's because of this that I have a VERY hard time talking and befriending other people, whether it be at work or at the store or wherever. I've come a long way in the past year in my progress to stop judging people based on there looks or whether they're smoking or drinking or not. I have come to learn that while there ARE some not-so-good people in this world, there are hundreds more decent human beings.\n\nSo now I'm wanting to actually begin making friends, everyone I work with, however doesn't seem to be that interested in me as they're all 10 years younger than me. Plus I'm engaged and a Dad so going out \"clubbing\" or just to the bar isn't really my thing. Anyone got some advice? Sorry for the long post, I tried to keep it as short as I could.",

        "text": "It's been a struggle for my entire life, just in different ways.\n\nAs a kid I was just naturally shy. Often I played by myself. There was also a period of about 2-3 years where I was often prevented from playing with most other kids due to a health condition, which I'm sure didn't help. I made two, genuinely good friends that I remember. I only met them because I was struggling with making friends, and an adult told me to go up to someone who seemed lonely. I did. Normally they weren't lonely but their usual friend was absent that day. To this day they have been the only people I could ever call \"friends\". Besides that, there was another kid I *tried* befriending, and he didn't have any other friends. Turned out, he didn't have friends because he was a huge asshole to his friends, so I stopped talking to him (and he bullied me for two years for it).\n\nIn middle school it got worse. I don't know why. I struggled just talking to people and I lost a lot of trust in other people since I felt like everyone was out to bully or humiliate me. I did meet two people, they were pretty nerdy like me. I thought they were my friends for awhile, but they kept doing things they *knew* I was uncomfortable with. In hindsight, they probably did it *because* I was uncomfortable with it. Eventually one of them crossed a line and again, I stopped talking to them. Their friend group bullied me again, for a year in high school this time.\n\nIn high school, I basically gave up. I never talked to anybody and I don't think I could have if I tried. I couldn't even keep a basic conversation going. I couldn't even bring myself to tell people what I liked to do for fun. At one point I actually made an \"alibi\" of sorts. I'd tell people I did \"x\" for fun, because x is more popular, and I did do some x, but not that much, enough that I could talk about it. I only ever used this \"alibi\" once though and it honestly didn't work as intended.\n\nNow I'm just... utterly lost. I'm not even in high school anymore. I'm around other young adults in college. I don't know how to talk to people, how to make lasting friendships. I'm a little more honest about myself but it still takes some courage to hope they're okay with it. But I've made no progress. I can't have a normal conversation. And don't get me started on my job- I feel like a freak. I just stand around sometimes when people are talking and having a good time. Some of my co-workers are okay with it, some of them don't care, a couple seem to actively dislike the way I am.\n\nIt's so fustrating. I don't even know how I can begin climbing out of this.",

This is because often times if you talk or ask about something deep, the other person may not be comfortable to talk about it even if they say so, and this doesnt progress the relationship and trust if they feel forced to go deeper.\n\nBesides that, if I suddenly reveal not-so-good parts about myself in order to spark conversation, the other person may not be interested in it right now and not reciprocate as much, even if my intention was to build trust.\n\nSo when would be a good time to talk about deeper topics, something that you really wanna talk about without being offputting?",

        "text": "If I did be myself, I’d have no friends. Because I believe the ideal way for humans to interact—which is what I’d strive towards if I be myself—is what society considers being an asshole.\n\nI’m this way because of the way I was raised. My father was always harshly critical of me and never sugarcoated the brutal reality of things. He seldom gave me positive reinforcement. When I was young I hated it, and I wished that my dad would be nicer like other kids dads. But as I grew older, I changed my mind and realized that his parenting style is really underrated. His words weren’t what I **liked** to hear, but they were exactly what I **needed** to hear. His criticism was very useful for helping me improve myself. Kids who grew up with “nice” parents would end up with overinflated egos and be unable to accept honest criticism. Kids who grew up without parents like my dad, are people who put emotions over facts. That’s how I see things, so I became dissatisfied with the way that people normally interact. I thought, “Wouldn’t we all be way better off if society was tolerant to negative and hurtful things as long as they are true?” We live in a society that places such great importance on protecting feelings that we’d rather lie just to avoid offending others than be brutally honest.\n\nI want to live in a world where people don’t view negative statements as unacceptable to say; a world where people point out each others flaws, not just give complements; a world that treats positivity and negativity equally instead of being severely biased in favor of positivity; a world where no one ever sacrifices honesty for positivity. **And because I believe in the saying “Be the change you want to see,” if I did be myself, I would behave as if I lived in that world.**\n\nBeing myself is a one-way ticket to being a universally hated human with no social life. So I choose to not be myself. I choose to say positive things and avoid saying negative things, even though this is not at all natural for me to do. I’m thankful that I can tolerate not being myself; I know that many people feel really uncomfortable if they don’t be themselves. Not being myself is the only way I can survive in this only-positivity-is-okay society. I will never be myself.",

I just had an awkward vibe and I’m visibly uncomfortable or trying too hard. No conversations come natural. I’m always thinking about what they are thinking about me, if I’m coming across as warm or not, and if they like me. I constantly feel like my guard is up and I can’t let my walls down. \n\nI’m open to all advice! Thank you.",

        "text": "So, I am in this conundrum in which several potential friendships that could have been end up not happening simply because I am not good at texting people.\n\nMeeting people in person is quite easy for me (I am generally quite outgoing). I am much more comfortable initiating conversations, picking up on cues, and expressing myself face to face.\n\nHowever, when it comes to following up with them online, I falter easily.\n\nFirst off, I do not know how to initiate conversation via text. When starting a convo, I tend to say a simple \"How's it going\" or \"What's up\". In person, this usually paves the way to fulfilling and deep conversations. Via instagram, doing the same just feels very awkward. It feels like I have to come up with something much more interesting than a simple \"what's up\" to keep the other person's attention.\n\nOther ideas I had to make my texts more interesting were to send memes, or to reply to their stories, but even then, I feel weird doing so, and fear that the other person might as well.\n\nSecond, it is impossible to pick up on nonverbal cues via text. This is even more difficult due to my Asperger's. I can't properly gauge how someone is feeling by just reading words, or if they're angry, sad, excited, or bored unless they put \"lol\" or emojis in their texts.\n\nOn a third note, I have a subtle fear of having the other misinterpret my intentions or getting the wrong idea. If I text too little, they might believe I'm not interested. If I text too much, they might get the impression that I am desperate and overly clingily (which I DO NOT want to come across as).\n\nI'm not a good texter because I overthink my texts to avoid awkwardness or adverse situations. I usually end up not initiating at all (not knowing what to say), or end up getting ghosted if I do something awkward.\n\nWhat frustrates me the most is the fact that a few weeks back I met a girl at the party (whom I hit off very well with) and got her Instagram. I haven't texted her at all yet because I was unsure of what to say (leading to the relationship to not form at all).\n\nIt is much easier to keep up with people in person (most of my close friendships are ones in which I can frequently meet with them in person).\n\nSo now I ask, how do I become a better texter?",

        "text": "I'm not a naive person, and I've been through quite a lot in my 36 years. Thing is I dealt with it better than most who have gone through the same or worse. So they automatically assume I'm never going to be able to understand, which I don't argue with, and what makes me sad is this causes them to push away. It's making me wonder if I really don't \"get it\"... I have  a lot to say, and am willing to listen and care. But, they use it against me, and I never get the chance. I feel like I'm being selfish or pushy if I try to go out of my way to convince them otherwise. Sometimes I feel like I need to take that leap and really show them I care or understand. There's this weird notion I've noticed though, it's somewhat like they hold it over my head as a sort of badge of honor or growth. \n\nI don't talk much or express myself, so I'm not exactly sure how to go about communicating with them and connecting. Some of them have bad habits I can't be a part of, like drinking, casual sex that doesn't feel right almost like I'd be taking advantage of that person (it's only one person I'm referring to in this case). So, in a way I guess I'm seen as a prude or something. \n\nPersonally this puts me in a middle ground of loneliness, not good enough for the successful and privileged, and not good enough for the ones society pushed aside or got into problems in the past... I lack an edge I guess. \n\nI'll be honest I'm a huge dork, whatever that might mean to you. I understand a lot more than I show, and my demeanor I guess puts off the vibe that I'm confused or nervous. I feel like I'm walking on eggshells a lot. I don't feel the need to \"help these people\" but I'd like them to give me a chance. Most of the assumptions people make about me are very condescending, but I take it in stride. \n\nI think I'm too careful socially, and people find it off putting. I think or worry too much, and it's very unattractive it seems. I lack a sort of charm or edge to other peoples judgement.",

        "text": "Where do I even start\n\nI am a 22 yo 188cm (6'2) dude. I live in a 1st world country. I weight 83kg (183 lbs) and been working out 3-5 times a week for couple years with variying intensity. I live with my parents which is fine as we got a big apartment in a big city. I worked for a bit and got some money. As I dont have to pay for rent or food really I can basically spend all my money on whatever I want. Clothes, drugs, tickets for raves, festivals, concerts you name it. I spend my time in University, playing video games, reading, studying (sometimes) and getting fucked up with friends (or alone lol). All in all I guess I live a nice life I suppose. But one thing I struggle hard with is showing and accepting affection. Be it girls or my friends. I am a very cynical person that has a lot of strong opinions about the world. I might appear narcissistic but lowkey I am very insecure and hate myself. Im not actually sure about this. I sometimes truely think I am the most insane person to ever walk on earth and sometime I just want to end it and stop existing and amputate my own brain. I got borderline personality disorder according to army psychologist. Thing is that I think of everybody else even lower than of myself. So I have a superiority god complex of sorts. However this only really works for me when my emotions arent involved. I dont have a lot of empathy. I did mbti tests a couple times and always came out either INTP or ENTP. I am quite impulsive. I also tested my big 5 and scored:\n\nhigh in openness, neuroticism\n\nmid in extroversion and conscientiousness and (very) low in agreeableness\n\nReason Im including this in this post is because I think this is where my problem is. The person I am when it isnt about my emotions is something totally different than the person I would be with someone I liked and wanted to be around with. I hate physical touch by guys and try to abstain from it. When girls touch me I enjoy it but Idk how to show that. I feel like my emotions overwhelm me. It feels like electricity when my crush shows affection. Its so strong I can barely stand it. I think this is a problem as it doesnt fit me. It doesnt go hand in hand with who I think I am. I got a friend for example that is extremely charismatic and loves hugging everybody. I hate that so much. It feels like fire. I am such an unfazed, unemotional tough guy that always knows it all. I always think Im smarter than everybody and got everything figured out but when it comes to my own emotions I feel like a complete idiot. I have the eq of a fkn brick. Idk what to do when a girl grinds on me in the club. When someone I am absolutely into touches my face and pulls up my sweater and puts her hands on my abs. I feel so incompetent. Idk how to advanced these types of situations even tho I want nothing more than this one particular girl. I become akward. They think Im uncomfortable even tho I love it. One of the reasons I enjoy getting stoned or doing mdma, acid etc is the emotional component. It feels like nothing compareable in my life. I think I am using that as a substitute for my desire to feel loved. As I got little empathy I dont feel the lack the human component as much I think. This is just my theory tho. My problem is not attracting girls. My problem is actually connecting who I am inside and who I am on the outside. I think its just my lack of experience. I have this weird thought that once I master my emotions I ascend to become a kindof deity. I would feel invincible or something I think. However until then I must figure out how to get laid plz help. Yes I realise how childish this entire post sounds. I sit at home all day today, got high, beat my meat a couple times and now Im losing my mind in the gym. I feel like my psyche is about to break. I lose my shit over trivial random things. I become a real asshole when Im depressed. Idfk what to do I feel so pointless. I become so self destructive. My anxiety goes through the roof. Almost every thought I have is negative. I feel like the world is out to get me or something. Like the universe is out to fuck with my brain and I have to stay strong but I just crumble and start wanna smoking weed again or drink idk. Also I think I  am a bit addicted to porn or at least nsfw media. I enjoy the intensity and adrenaline. However it kills my sex drive and numbs me to fucked up shit thats happening in the world. I feel like a mess psychologically lol\n\nI feel like I have 2 different states of mind. I either hate myself a lot and have extreme self esteem issues and doubt myself in literally everything I do or I think I become the most confident person ever and feel like a god and also become chariatic but almost to a sociopathic degree. I start walking over people and start ignoring everything that doesnt bring me closer to what I want. But then I have some trigger like my body dysmorphia or my own emotions when somebody actually gives me a feeling of being wanted and I just crumble like a toothpick that is exptected to hold up a 30 ton rock. Wtf do I do lol I sometimes think I fucked up my own personality with my believes lol",

I'll admit as a teenager and a early 20s adult I wanted to have a lot of friends really badly, I wanted a friendship group quite a lot I did go through quite a lot of betrayals and growing apart like I think we all did. But I got to a point in 2019 where I just stopped desiring that and I managed to make way more friends and even friendship groups and regularly going to social events after I no longer desired it that badly, kind of ironic right?\n\nWell anyway the friends I made in that time continued to disappoint me over and over again that I just have even less of a desire to even talk to new people? lol. I just now see it as kind of a pointless endeavour I am not gonna benefit from trying to socialise with people who are increasingly addicted to their devices and other thing &amp; staying at home and avoiding any type of public socialisation that doesn't involve some kind of intoxication.\n\nI recognise part of this is just being jaded from disappointing people and maybe wanting to avoid that but another part of me just thinks people as a whole aren't as interesting to talk to? It just seems so boring to me as a whole and like I've already met most of the interesting people I'll ever meet.",

He knows I was sexually abused and hate being touched by men. This really triggered me and I'm having a hard time not falling into a depression episode cause my depression is trauma based and I've been doing my best to keep busy, but I so badly just wanna cry in bed forever right now (that would be bad for me though)\n\nBut I wanna address how f\\*cked up that was for him to do that but I don't know if I should but I'm reallly hurt and it shows he doesn't respect me at all. And we're finishing our second/final year of college and he's liked me since the first semester and I rejected him multiple times so I already knew he wasn't the best guy cause he kept pursuing me but did nothing to show me he actually wants me (he just complimented me a lot and tried to convince me to be with him) and so yeah. I'm just hurt and idk if I should say anything but if I should, what should I say? Cause I'm tempted to text yell at him (I can do it in person if that would be better, but I don't want my other classmates around. Cause we're a small program so we are all friends)\n\nToday I didn't speak to him but having his sit behind me in class caused so much stress, I was shaking my leg the whole time (very rare for me) and my stomach hurt and I was just nervous an idk what to do. I got in my car after and I cried for a bit to release some of the stress just that caused me.",

        "text": "So I have started to realize that I'm pretty contradictory when it comes to social situations. When I'm at work or in a situation where I have to interact with people, I find myself doing the bare minimum such as replying and making casual conversations when people come up and talk to me in order to not make it awkward. However, I always get away from those situations as fast as I can and mainly keep to myself as I get increasingly more and more exhausted the longer I have to keep the conversation going. As a result I look visibly tired and people would often come up to me and ask if I'm okay and I default to saying that I didn't have enough sleep in order to not worry people.\n\nFrom what I said above, I probably give off the impression that I'm pretty antisocial and despise any form of social situations. While it is somewhat true that I dislike small talk, I find myself feeling pretty lonely when I go days or weeks without having someone to hang out with. Problem is, this loneliness is becoming more and more frequent as I have drifted away from alot of friends from school after I graduated and the 2 people that I even hang out with nowadays are also usually quite busy themselves, not to mention my unusual working hours (2 12 hour day shifts &gt; 2 days off &gt; 2 12 hours night shift &gt; repeat) means that I very seldom have the chance to meet up with my friends. So I guess my dilemma here is that, as someone that craves social interaction from friends, why is it that when presented with a chance to make new friends and have the social interaction that I desire, I end up really dreading it and escaping the first chance I get? How do I stop dreading social situations and make new friends?\n\nTLDR: gets lonely when my 2 friends are not available but absolutely hating any form of social interaction where I could potentially make new friends. Any advice?",

We have a different sense of humor and beyond video games and some TV we have different interests but he keeps messaging me like meaningless stuff like \"wyd rn\" and I don't want to engage in those meaningless conversations where it feels like I have to reply.\n\n\nNow this person is genuinely a kind and understanding and mature person. He just seems way more sociable than me (and he's like a decade older than me, and even though I'm a young adult that's still quite an age gap). He's a good person and I don't want to just \"ghost\" him out of nowhere.\n\n\nI've been careful and he doesn't have my social media, only my Discord and a server we are mutual on but don't really use that often. Is there any polite way of saying \"I don't really like you all that much as a friend nor acquaintance so stop messaging me thanks?\" Because again this guy isn't a bad guy. He's just not someone I really enjoy hanging out with anymore. It's mostly me, not him.",

        "text": "Hello guys.\n\nI wanted to ask for some advice. I recently moved to a new country and started school there. Here, I am having trouble finding new friends. I don't want to shift the blame on anyone, but it just seemed \"easier\" in my previous school where I at least knew the name of some people. I wasn't exactly the most popular person, but I had a good enough social circle that I could speak and chat with regularly.\n\nMy new school is structured like a university. You have different people each class and you only take a class for one semester. Plus, the desks are separated and the classroom is quite crowded, so it's hard to speak to anyone. My previous school was quite literally the opposite of this.\n\nI joined a few clubs to break this cycle but that didn't really work. I feel like everyone already knows each other and they don't speak often to new people. And the school spent the last few years in lockdown, so maybe people's social skills got a little rusty?\n\nIt makes me feel terrible seeing people talk and chat with each other. The school is also really big btw, feels like a university campus.\n\nI only want a few friends that I can talk regularly. My social anxiety also got worse recently, given that I am having little to no social interactions. What are your advices for me?",

        "text": "SHORT VERSION:\n\nI do have an issue with banter but I've realized it is very specific to family and friends who I've known for a long time.  Basically their banter bothers me although most people's does not.  This is because I do not like the way I was when they met me and when they tease me I worry they still see me this way.\n\nMaybe this is related to \"imposter syndrome\" but I'm not sure.\n\nHas anyone dealt with a similar issue and if so how did you train your mind to stop jumping to such conclusions?\n\nLONGER VERSION:\n\nFor background I'm in my late 30s, I don't say the following to try to brag but I have a pretty good career $-wise (not a multimillionaire or anything but enough to live comfortably), own a home and have a beautiful (at least in my eyes) wife.\n\nIt wasn't always like this though.  In my mid-20s I was shy, overweight, seemed to have no luck with women and liked where I worked but was underpaid and had no upward mobility.  I also felt like the \"unimportant friend\" of my peer group (people would ask for my help but would always dismiss my opinion, I would be the last one invited, etc.)\n\nI realize when friends and family banter with me sometimes in my mind I will jump to the conclusion that they still look down on me despite how hard I worked and how I progressed since then.  In their minds I'll always be the \"loser friend\" or disappointment son/brother and I'll get angry.  Maybe they are just joking, I usually assume so and will fake laugh along to be polite but inside I will be angry for hours afterward sometimes.\n\nI don't really banter with people much as you can sometimes hit a nerve unintentionally so I stick with innocuous comments like someone always forgets their keys.  I guess you can say I have a friendly but safe and boring personality like a non-religious Ned Flanders.\n\nI don't think I am normally a sensitive person - I am good at taking criticism, I don't really care if someone I barely know tries to rib me or tease me about something, and if someone yells at me or flicks me off in traffic for example I don't really get angry or take it personally.",

Everything I do nicely like smile or waving hi to them from far, I usually get a ‘What the fuck is he doing’ look and make me feel like a clown or something bothering people. There are no vibes. I once saw my German teacher from far and she was looking at me, so by manners of respect I have smiled and waved at her, she gave me an awkward stare that made me feel guilty for something I mean nicely. I like to be myself, fun, not serious. What I saw here is making me understand why people in Europe are suffering from depression more than poor countries. Everything has no value here, I can kiss a beautiful random girl I meet in night clubs because of my look, and that’s making me understand now why my parents don’t want me in a relationship with a French girl. I feel there is a little racism towards me, even if it’s unnoticeable. I don’t know what to do",

        "text": "well Ill basically tell my story of how is everything went down the hill.. and how I stopped being this one loser dude and started to improve myself.  \n\n  \n with an interesting story..  \nI always thought I was special. or I was the chosen one. I thought I deserved all the love and attention.. basically I was a people pleaser. I remember how I felt in this period of time..  \nI used to be anxious to get into arguments or to talk back. or not agreeing with people, cause I had this feeling of. not betraying your \"master\" and if I will talk back. they will probably leave me. I really believed in it.. And I wish there was another way to me but was gave me real awareness It's when I started smoking w33d. Suddenly I had this thoughts and feeling I've never had before.. Suddenly I felt Like I am my own person. and so I started to dig into it. it was summer so there was no school. I remember me being in my most depressed time trying to find answers (feel like I skipped too many parts so let me explain), while being aware to the thoughts and actions, Me and my gf(Group friends) were only 3 people. let call them B and R. as we started to sit more together with our j( Joints and smoked w33d)  \nB started to behave to me differently from some reason.. It started since he started to smoke. He started to being manipulative and toxic to me. and in this period of time I didn't knew how to answer so Ill just yell on him and argued with him back.. and it made me real anxious.. I didn't understand why he started suddenly to treat me like a fan. sometimes he acknowledged me.. and sometimes he treat me like a fan of his(ignored me and didn't even looked at me)\n\nand in this timeline I started to wonder a lot. and started to look for answers. I always read about weed and how it really effects the human brain and mind. mentally and physically. There was a period of time I had weed psychosis. which involved derealization And depersonalization ( I got to say. I'm not Fully supporting Self-diagnosis But sometimes It's fine to try look for some answers on yourself, if you doubting sometimes. but it doesn't mean its the truth. we all are different people who live their own lives and face their own problems!)\n\nanyways let's get back to it. it was hard to deal with all the stress So I tried to talk more to B(friend)  \nI tried to talk to him with what's wrong with us and how to make things better.. but sometimes he would just pretend nothing happened and everything is ok. and sometimes he would just blame his anger issues. It was really hard for me to cope with it.. I didn't had anyone to talk to. (that's what I thought). cause I could try to talk to him. in this period of time. But I didn't.. I really don't know why.. Cause I think it would made things better. with time passes by. I realized I can be someone else. I can be a different person. I can be a BETTER person. I can have a new personality and new approach of life and things. I understood that like you can change yourself physically. you could change yourself mentally. and so I started my change. (-for the people who lost me here. I'm talking about me realizing I don't need other person opinions or attention to keep moving.)  \nAnd that's when I started to feel alive in my life. Alive Like I never lived before. I tried to learn how to talk back. how to have more confidence etc.. But trying to live someone's else life had put me down to the ground again and again, I fall in bad moods every week. and when I even started to feel slightly better, I already knew my downfall will be hard this time. and it was hard for me to cope with it. I'm not going to lie. I was weak. I had nobody. It was me vs me. I knew I needed to change. That's when R(my other friends) gets in the picture. Me and R knowing each other for 10 years know. We're good friends, but since all this w33d stuff started. we didn't got to be close as we used to.. cause I Was more busy in myself.. So I started to talk to him. I opened up and told him How I Feel towards all this situation. and he really helped me in this time. I own him a lot. I own him a big thanks. (which writing this right now. gave me this idea so I will talk to him about it when we will meet and thank him when he was in my side)  \nback to the story. I felt Like I'm losing my mind.. The way he manipulated me and treated me made me think .. Did he treat me bad or I'm just an idiot who is over reacting..?? So I talked to R and he told me that B even told him that he's being manipulative to me. And this when things started to snap. I really don't remember a lot in this period of time. But I can tell you what happened by some memories and feeling. I finally found myself. I understood I just need to be the real me. And I do not need to try living in fake shadow , I started setting myself boundaries and goals and wills. and about B. I understood I need to take a step back to look at the whole picture to analyze it. and understand what's the best thing I can do.. I started being more a person than some people pleaser who really cares what people got to say about him I got real confidence and started to really live better.. I started to live by MY Book. and not others. and I gotta share it.. Theres this one saying that helped me pushing my way forward.. one of the best saying i've ever heard.. \"People opinion doesn't define your reality\".. its not about how deep its sounds . All the matters that if it speaks to you Or It's not. its that simple. If you feel like this saying has a something big. has a big part of your life. then it can be use as a usefull tool. let's go back to the story. Till to this day Ive been trying to live as a normal human being. And also.. I'm recovering from the weed.(5 months!) It's not for me cause I always had bad trips and felt awful. and not to sound like a pu$$y . I'm still friend with B to this day.. Yeah I know.. I stopped talking to him as regularly as I did. but he thinks its means I just matured up..??? Like.. He's not even aware of the hell He set me tru.. I tried to talk to him But all he got to say that I'm imagining and nothing happend. so to this day we still \"known to each other\" But i do not talk to him in my free time and I don't hangout with him.  \nAnd this thing \"people pleaser\" got a big part of the story I believe.. I sometimes really be thinking if it was cause I was people pleaser and it was my fault? but it doesn't mean I deserved to be treat like a piece of shit.. So yeah.. That's one part of my story... Cause theres a lot more. But its really basically my whole to till now life \"crisis\" one of them.. haha",

        "text": "client story: One of my coaching clients told me a story this week. There is a local community space in her area that puts on epic concerts and events. From her first time entering the space many months ago, she has wanted to be more involved with the community. But she didn't know how to do this. The result: she feels lonely, guilty, and fearful. She's lonely when she goes to events there because she tends to isolate herself when she's there. She feels guilty because she knows she isn't living her full potential. And she's fearful to do anything differently. In our recent session we broke this down, moved through her bottlenecks, and came up with an action plan for her to pursue her dreams. **I'm sharing her story here confidentially in case anyone else is struggling with a similar challenge and is looking for a solution.**\n\nThe solution is second nature to me because I have spent so many years networking my way into rewarding and fulfilling situations/experiences. But for her, she didn't know where to start! Starting something new is scary and usually the hardest part. I completely understand this and have lived this countless times. We magnify our problem (I'm not where I want to be) and that keeps us from achieving our goals because we recreate this reality every single day. Just a few small shifts in our perception and actions can make all the difference. This is key! It takes the pressure off of making massive changes and helps us focus on what we can truly control and improve upon in small doses.\n\nThe first step we came up with together was to establish communication. I had her fill out a contact form on their website. Basically: \"hi, I'm \\_\\_\\_\\_. I'm passionate about music and community. Your space has been really impactful in my time here and I love coming to your events. I'm wondering if there are any opportunities to become more involved with your organization. Would someone from your team be willing to talk on the phone for 15 minutes so I could learn more about your mission?\" I also had her call the place to ask a few questions: \"I saw on your website that you have an event this weekend. Is this still happening? Are there any events not listed on your website that I could attend?\" These actions help get the gears turning and give her some positive reference experience.\n\nThe second step is to come up with a list of questions that she has. You see, in our minds we have all of these questions floating around that are never going to get answered. A great step to find answers is to put the questions down into the physical form - grab a pencil and paper and write out 3-5 questions that you have about getting involved. Also write 1-2 sentences for each question about *why* you are asking them. Now you have a few talking points about yourself as well as the necessary questions to learn more information.\n\nThe third step would be set up the call or meeting if they are able to meet with you. Obviously there is some nuance here, but it's pretty straightforward. Arrange a call, discuss your points, and ask your questions.\n\nA fourth step would be to show up. Show up to the call. Show up to events. Arrange more meetings and hangouts. Key point here: Truly show up. Don't just go and do the same old thing. Adopt a new mindset, a new intention. Meet people. Shake hands. Ask questions. Have fun. The more you engage with people in this space, the more comfortable you will start to feel. Think of it as a practice. You won't be perfect the first time. But by continuing to show up and putting your energy into something that you love, you will start to learn more about how you fit in. Opportunities will arise as if from nowhere, but you've created them with your persistence.\n\nAnd the fifth step is to follow-up. Keep conversations moving with staff and patrons. Keep coming up with questions and talking points that help you uncover more collaboration. Develop connections with people through coffee meetups, showing up to social events, and eventually creating your own shared experiences.\n\nThis week I'll be checking in with my client to see what happens. I'm sure she will have questions. I'm sure she can uncover the answers. I told her there will likley be mistakes and lessons. *But this is where we grow. This is how we get from \"who we are\" to \"who we want to be.\" Small steps each day towards our goals.* \n\nAnd one day further down the road, we lift up our head and we realize that we have created the life we want. We have networked our way into the situations we desire. We are the person that we want to be. **And that's magic.**",

It kills me inside and makes me feel almost the worst I’ve ever felt. The problem is when I ask them to chill out and maybe let back a little bit it only got vastly worse. I can’t tell if maybe I’m wrong and I’m the issue or if I need new friends. Pls ask me questions as I know this isn’t in depth as can be. Thank you",

The 3 of them have been friends since high school. The things that they talk about would be chinese celebs/idols like 70% of the time or anything related to it. There's totally nothing wrong with it. I don't mind listening but I've decided to not expect myself to be able to be friends with them. I'm the total opposite. I use tiktok they use douyin(chinese ver of tiktok). I use twitter/reddit they use weibo/xioahongshu. I watch anime and read webtoons, they don't. They listen to chinese music, I don't. I find myself most of the time either listening to them only or asking questions about the topic they are talking about but it's not really enjoyable.\n\nAlmost everyone in my uni speaks chinese and so do I. The only problem is I find it hard to find people that have the same interest as me. How should I put this? They like chinese I like english (if this makes sense).",

        "text": "There's a general rule that if you let another person talk about themself or about the things they do or love, they will find you more interesting and you will have better conversations.\n\nI've done and applied this and found out that it really worked, because I can have conversations that last for hours.\n\nBut there's one case with my best friend where I keep doing it to her. But if I switch and start to talk about myself for a bit (something like, \"hey that happened to me too the other day... \" and then a small story about a similar experience), the conversation will feel like it dies and it just seems that she's just not interested in me anymore. On the other hand, I could literally get her to text me for a full 8 hours non stop (I'm not joking) if I let her ramble about herself and things she does and likes. I don't mind talking about her all the time, but I sometimes feel like it would be more interesting if she actually reciprocated interest.\n\nSomehow this made me think, at what point does this technique become people pleasing instead of making you a good conversationalist?",
