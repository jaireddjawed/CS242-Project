Blame!!&lt; and found to varying degrees in other works of &gt;!Tsutomu Nihei!&lt;. Maybe the &gt;!TTRPG \"Eclipse Phase\"!&lt; too, now that I think about it.\n\nLike in any voyage, there is always a risk of becoming lost and never finding either destination nor your way back. I think transhumanism is the same and there seems to be very few works that explore this. (I consider most cyberpunk to just scratch the surface of transhumanism.)\n\nWhat is your vision of this ?",

        "text": "I know that many futurists envision a future where their brain is directly connected to the internet and they become superhuman. There are a lot of reasons this isn't going to happen as they envision it, but the biggest bottleneck is the speed at which neurons communicate -- super slow compared to computers.\n\nWe're very close to photonic chips that communicate at the speed of light.\n\nOf course, the futurists answer is that all of our neurons will be replaced with nanomagic. All to save us from becoming obsolete. To me it's like talking about horses becoming automobiles. It's not likely to happen. \n\nThat doesn't mean there won't be a lot of amazing technologies and there probably will be brain computer interfaces but they will be limited by the slow speeds of our bio-chemical brains. We won't evolve into super-AI's.\n\nAI will continue to evolve and it will not be limited by the substrate like humans. I know many of you want to be AIs, but a consolation prize is that we're humans that made AI possible and our imprint is carved deeply into the AIs and so that will be our legacy.\n\nNote: one possible out is that we're living in a simulation and you're already an AI who is experiencing what it is like to be a human during the dawn of AI. \n\nListed below is a ChatGPT essay on the topic. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nBrain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have been a topic of great interest and research in the field of artificial intelligence. The goal of BCIs is to create a direct connection between the human brain and computers, allowing us to control machines with our thoughts. This has the potential to greatly enhance our abilities, however, there are significant challenges that must be overcome in order to achieve this. One of the biggest challenges is the speed at which the human brain processes information compared to computers.\n\nComputers are much faster than the human brain when it comes to processing information. They can perform millions of calculations per second, whereas the human brain operates at a much slower pace. This speed difference is due in part to the way neurons in the brain communicate with each other. Neurons communicate by sending electrical signals, or action potentials, from one neuron to another. These signals travel at speeds of up to 120 meters per second, which is relatively slow compared to the speed at which electronic signals can travel in computers.\n\nThe speed at which the brain processes information is also limited by the number of neurons that are involved in a given task. When we perform a task, such as moving our arm, many neurons in the brain are activated and communicate with each other in a highly coordinated manner. This coordination takes time, and the slower speed of the action potentials contributes to the overall slower processing speed of the brain.\n\nIn order to create a BCI that would give us AI-like powers, we would need to overcome the speed limitations of the human brain. This would require developing technology that is capable of processing information at the same speed a computer. Currently, this is not possible due to the limitations of our current understanding of how the brain works. For example, we still do not fully understand how neurons communicate with each other, and how they work together to control our movements and thoughts.\n\nIn conclusion, the speed at which the human brain processes information compared to computers is one of the biggest challenges facing the development of BCIs. This is due to the limitations of the speed at which neurons communicate with each other, and the number of neurons involved in a given task. Until we have a better understanding of how the brain works, it is unlikely that BCIs will be able to achieve the level of speed and accuracy that is required to give us AI-like powers.",

        "text": " Hello everyone on Reddit! Today we want to talk about biological age and aging markers. With life expectancy on the rise, there are more and more elderly people and therefore a higher prevalence of age-associated diseases.\n\nIt's important to understand that aging is a natural process, but it can affect some of the most vital biological functions, which can lead to death. The pace of aging is individual and multifactorial, so the assessment of biological age is essential as an indicator of overall health.\n\nFor this reason, it's crucial to have accurate and straightforward age assessment tools. These tools should be non-invasive, economical, and based on modifiable criteria that can be used as therapeutic targets.\n\nAge calculators meet these requirements for routine clinical practice. Clinical marker-based calculators are optimal for health screening and allow identification of risk groups for accelerated aging and development of individualized prevention strategies.\n\nIn recent years, mixed-type calculators have emerged that combine clinical and epigenetic features and provide a more comprehensive and reliable assessment of the pace of aging. However, these calculators are more expensive, which can make routine application difficult.\n\nWe believe that analysis of epigenetic changes will soon be widely available in routine clinical practice. In conclusion, we continue to explore and learn about biological age and aging markers, and we hope that this information is of interest to you as well. Thank you for reading!  \nFull text: [https://globaltranshuman.wordpress.com/2023/02/06/biological-age-predictors-the-status-quo-and-future-trends/](https://globaltranshuman.wordpress.com/2023/02/06/biological-age-predictors-the-status-quo-and-future-trends/)\n\nPaper: [https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/23/23/15103](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/23/23/15103)\n\nAging Course: [https://transhuman-organization.gitbook.io/freecourses/](https://transhuman-organization.gitbook.io/freecourses/)",

How would organizations adapt to such new measures of technology and how accesible will it be? \n\n-Incentives\n\nWith a rising number of people on the religion of atheism (having no moral obligation towards a kingdom come) the need to extend life would seem logical for the most part. (I may be wrong)\n\nWith AI on the playing field the incentives of corporations to outsource labor is greater, could people focus on developing a more sustainable world and forming a more suitable economy in this new technological revolution?\n\n-Questions\n\nUrgency to creating a more sustainable world how could LEV be approached? Will it be sustainable to begin with?\n\n\nThere are many questions to be pondered before we make accurate predictions, it’s still hard nonetheless to come out with a clear answer specially if there is no involvement in the field of life extension from the individual.\n \n-What we could discover\n\n\nCould we make some accurate assumption regardless of this?\n\nI’m still very ignorant I’m just a student, from what I’ve learned however I’ve discovered that the financial markets could provide a great insight on what could be developed in the future.",

I was just wondering if anyone here has any ambitions aligned with Transhumanism or is planning for a career related to it, especially students. \n\nI am soon going to start university, and I have formed a rough plan of what I wish to do in the future.  It doesn't fit any of the conventional careers present today, the fields it involved are very new and there aren't many people working in them at the moment.\n\nIn brief, I'm interested in some topics that are investigated by computational and cognitive neuroscience through the lens of multiple disciplines, such as intelligence, memory, consciousness and emotions. \n\nI'm curious to understand these phenomena, but also to eventually be able to have an impact in the field of disorders related to deficits in cognition and intelligence, and cognitive enhancement. \n\nOther than that I'm also interested in topics like genetic engineering, brain-computer interfaces, neural implants, altered states of consciousness and the psychedelic revolution, synthetic biology, Longevity research, biocompatible nanomaterials and personalized healthcare/ precision medicine.\n\nMy interest understanding intelligence also relates to my desire to implement it in machines at the right level of abstraction to develop AGI, or at least more efficient AI, and investigate systems like ANNs to understand the brain more clearly so both of the fields could be mutually beneficial to each other.\n\nI was curious if anyone else has any such plans, and wishes to pursue a career to further the goals of transhumanism. If so, feel free to share your plans or connect if you have similar interests or work in any of the fields I have mentioned in this post. Thank you.",

Don't forget they did the fucking mind control experiments in the 70's.. that was 50 years ago and we have quantum computers now.\n\nI spend 8 out of the last 10 year being abused.

And the genes and physiological potential to do so (albeit dormant) is within us humans. \n\nWith hibernation you don't risk being in a state of death unlike cryoperservation because you were never dead. You are merwly in a vegetative state, till whenever you get resuscitated. \n\nWhile natural hibernation is common, artificial/synthetic hibernation is still being researched, and it has been proven to work on mice, which don't naturally hibernate, using drugs to achieve e this. There are knowing various ways researchers have found to induce hibernation. \n\nThe only question now is, can it be safely done for humans and if so how long? If medicine permits we may see people with currently incurable diseases or people in need of urgent transplant placed in hibernation till whenever their medical procedures can be carried out. \n\nAnd in the future we could see people doing this, as an alternative to cryoperservation. Extending their life to deep in the future to a time where death and diseases mightve een solved. Although this would likely be much more expensive that regular cryoperservation.",
