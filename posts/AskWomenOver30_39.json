        "text": "Hello, fellow redditors! \n\nAs you could probably see from my history, I have a twin sister (25) who has been in a relationship with a guy 15insh years her senior that I'm not very fond of. \n\nWe are on a trip now with my other sister (older) and her boyfriend. \nMy twin's partner was okai all day yesterday. Nothing was wrong. We all had fun even I and him interacted a little in a very friendly manner. \nToday, everything was fine up until the afternoon, when he came to the hot tub very bothered that my twin woke him up to come. He's been super moody ever since, making comments, being passive aggressive towards her, just spoiling the mood with his moodiness. \n\nShe is of course upset, because we came here to have a good time and yet here we are, sitting silently at the table, because one of us can't control our attitudes. \nIn case it matters, I heard him repeatedly referring to women as \"cunts\". \n\nThey've been together 4ish years and while he wasn't my favourite, I thought he was okai, but as of late, I can't think that anymore. Maybe he's depressed, maybe it's a midlife crisis, who knows? I am a bit worried about him, but I'm obviously much more worried about my own sister. I want her to find someone who treats her right ALL the time, not just 50/50. \n\nI don't know what to do. I try not to tell her to break up with him, because it needs to be her decision. But seeing her suffering is the worst thing in the world, she's literally the most important person to me in this life. I want her to be happy!! \n\n\nTd;lr: My twin sister's boyfriend doesn't treat her right all the time. When he does, he is the sweetest l, when he doesn't he's just stonewalling her/ignoring her and being petty",

If you're wondering why I'd want to #1  it's because it's her day and it would be a nice thing to do.  #2 I'm quite surprised at the fact she reaches out at all (given how poorly it ended) and that shows initiative.  We're on good speaking terms so shouldn't I show some every now and then?\n\nThen again the boyfriend thing is a real grey apprehensive area for me.  We also got to this point of us being on good speaking terms without me doing any of the reaching out.",

        "text": "Wanted to get advice from women my partners age. \n\nMy partner believes she has “relationship OCD”; often she’ll compulsively look for faults in me or the relationship. This doesn’t happen all of the time; but often enough. She believes it’s triggered also my “PMDD”.\n\nSo, when this part of her is activated she intentionally tries to initiate fights. I try to practice kindness, compassion, &amp; understanding; which usually turns into profusely apologizing for something I know I didn’t do. But if I do say the wrong thing; she’ll take it as a criticism or an attack and use it as fuel to engage in a fight (or as reassurance of the compulsive relationship OCD thoughts). So I’m left walking on eggshells when she’s activated. Trying not to rock the boat\n\nOn one hand; I know this is toxic/unhealthy, and honestly emotional abuse. On the other hand, I know I have a part in it too. I know when she’s activated, It triggers my codependency/childhood wounds; to where I placate her and walk on eggshells rather than share my feelings; for fear that rocking the boat will make her take her love away.\n\nBut also, I know that walking on eggshells is also a sign that I care and that I want to preserve the relationship. And I also know her creating an environment where I have to walk on eggshells is also just pain masked as anger; which is also rooted in a want to connect, right?\n\nI guess I just don’t know if I should take this an invitation for vulnerability and a chance at deeper emotional connection with my partner, or do I take it as a sign of a toxic/unhealthy relationship?\n\nThoughts?",

        "text": "Hi ladies, I know the general advice is always \"it's never too late\", but would love some encouragement/words of wisdom from people who have completely turned their life around in their 30s (or later). Sorry about the formatting I'm on mobile, and if this turns into a long essay!\nI've never really found any work I've enjoyed or had fulfilment from - I did an apprenticeship then chartered accountancy exams when I was younger and worked in that field for some time, however I honestly don't care at all about telling companies or individuals how much money they have or how much tax to pay. I left the UK which was my home country 11 years ago and have travelled extensively since then, working mainly manual labour jobs or odd projects I picked up along the way. In 2019 I stopped moving for a while and set up a restaurant as this had been a dream of mine and I felt it was time for me to stop moving around so much. This was crazy amounts of work, 20 hours a day often 7 days a week, and losing it to covid was frankly a relief. Since then I've gone back to the accounting and doing that part time while trying several other projects, including private chef work on the side while travelling slowly again.\nSo now I'm thinking of giving myself a complete reset - doing a degree (probably online as I can't face being a mature student on campus around a load of 18 year olds!) in psychology and counseling, followed by a masters (maybe in person) and persuing a career as a psychotherapist. I think it could be a rewarding work, and one that I have well suited characteristics for....but the thought of committing to 3-5 years studying for it, spending all my savings and probably getting into some debt for it and starting again from scratch is terrifying! I have been drawn to the profession for several years now, but I'm lacking the confidence to really go for it. I also don't know whether I should go back to the UK (where generally I've always felt unhappy) to be eligible for student loans, or to set up a base in a cheaper country for the 3 years online study and find another way to fund it. I would keep up my part time accountancy work while studying.\nThanks for reading!",

I tell them lots of things, we have pretty open communication, etc. \n\nThey almost never call me. \n\nIt would take probably 2 weeks of me not calling or texting them for them to think something was wrong and call to check-in. I am the one to call them, and I often feel like I have to call with a purpose (since that’s usually why they would call me.) They only call only if it’s urgent —about things like, “so and so is in the hospital” or “what would you like to bring for Christmas dinner?” But rarely if ever call to just see how I’m doing. \n\nIf I call just to talk and check in with them, they always seem thrown off, even though I do it often!  I feel like I have to lead the conversation with, “hey—I was calling because…” or “hey, so I just saw this news article…” the conversation then can easily progress and we can talk about all kinds of things, but if I call to say, “hey, just calling to say hi…” they genuinely don’t know how to respond. \n\nWondering if any one else experiences this? What is your communication like with your parents? I understand that everyone has different relationships with their own, but is this common?\n\nThey’re like this with my siblings too. I’ll ask if they’ve talked to my them recently and it’s not uncommon for them to say it’s been a few weeks.",

I was really sad - we had only met 4 or 5 times, but I felt a rare connection, thought he was amazing (like my dream list of attributes), and truly thought this was going somewhere.\n\nThe problem now is that even after several weeks, Im thinking about him to a point that feels not normal or healthy. I wake up thinking about it. I harbor a hope that things will end with this other person and he will come back, a hope I am trying to tamp out. Im trying to keep busy with friends and hobbies and going on other dates, but the thoughts are still there. And on dates,this is horrible, but the men I’ve been out with just feel like a step down across the board in terms of either looks, humor, fun, intelligence, ambitions, etc (he just really was the full package) and I’m scared I’ll never find someone as amazing as him. I’ve had men end things with me after 2 or 3 dates and been mostly fine and moved on totally okay, but here it feels so much harder, and like my feelings for him were so much stronger. Like I had that intense rush of happiness for him that you feel when you’re starting to fall for someone.\n\nIt’s really frustrating, especially because im sure he isn’t even thinking of me as he falls in love with this other person he liked more instead. Im having a really hard time getting back to the much healthier place I was before all this, where I was dating and hoped to find a relationship, but was generally happy and fine on my own. Versus now, where wanting him or wanting to find love is all I can think about, I’m trying my best to be okay, but feel heartbroken and miserable.  I don’t know how to get past this and feel like everything I’m doing is not working. How do I fix this and really be okay again?",

        "text": "If you had asked me one week ago about my relationship, I couldn't have been more in love. We were the happy couple, the lay in bed in the mornings and talk about life couple, the picture perfect couple going on road trips, the each of us were loved by the parents of the other person....we had something special.\n\nThat was until I was laying in the bed next to him studying for my exam, only to look up at him throwing a water pitcher at the wall less than a foot away from my body, shattering it into pieces over the fact he was sick of laying on an uncomfortable pillow. There was no prior argument that led up to this, it was sudden, but it wasn't his first outburst of frustration. Weeks earlier, he couldn't find his Apple Pencil; the result, everything thrown from the bed. That time nothing broke. He promised to change his temper, to work on things. I accepted this.\n\nAfter this week with the water pitcher, when I told him he hadn't changed, in his words, he said he \"doesn't have outbursts often\", he \"got too comfortable with me\", and it is \"no different than a guy throwing a video game controller with his buddies\". I was so scared, I ran into the bathroom and locked the door as I didn't know what he would do next. He cried when I came out and apologized. He told me he took out the trash to make it up to me. Next time, what will be outburst be over? Where will I go? What if I am in the way?\n\nHence, this was my final straw.\n\nHowever, once I left, I realize that I dismissed, not missed, all the red flags that led up to this.\n\n* The \"I Love You\" on the 3rd date, the \"I hope to marry you\" three months in. I questioned this, and the response was, \"If you don't feel the same way, then leave.\"\n   * I thought it was weird but thought, maybe he just truly really loves me as I am special. \n* I missed the signs when he had me move in with him less than a month after meeting.\n   * It was convenient as we we lived an hour and half from each other. I was coming over almost every other day anyways. \n* I dismissed the fact he continued to get STD testing despite we are in a committed relationship. I found the $200 rapid test box tucked next to the trash can when I came home after visiting family. When questioned, he said he was paranoid while I was gone as his male friend got diagnosed with one despite having no symptoms and asked \"How could you possibly accuse me of cheating?\" \n   *  Oh, he is just being safe as some STD’s don’t have symptoms. Everyone should be tested, including me despite the fact I've only had sex with him ever.\n* I dismissed the sign when he begged me to quit my job as my boss is so mean to me and recommended I go from a 100k salary to 40k part time as he will take care of me. Reminding me that I was \"retarded\" at my current job, and that I should accept failure as I have never failed before.\n   *  Oh, maybe I should quit my job as my boss is mean to me. Life is about happiness. And I don’t need to pay rent living with him so I save money. \n* I feel sick that I dismissed it when I said it hurt and he kept going, only offering to switch positions when I yelled, with a shut up under his breath. I feel gross for sharing my body with him now, like a damaged good. Something so special, lost. I remember in the beginning, always pushing his hand away as it went down there, but he would always put it back, pushing my boundaries.\n   *  Oh, I should shut up as sex is supposed to hurt a little bit. It will pass and then feel better. Nobody likes when people complain.\n* I didn't dismiss it when he told me he was proud of being a jealous man, and said he would be uncomfortable with me talking to an online male friend every day. \"Why would I need that? He doesn't need to talk to women when he has me.\" I laughed when he said his only red flag was cuddling too much.\n* Everything I brought up to do was a chore for him. The things I wanted to do would be pushed off to the future. I never found my voice around him, similar to being nervous around a middle school crush.\n* I never recognized the fact it never felt as if I had room to breathe in his home. It was always, \"come be with me.\" I would text my father when he went to the bathroom, as I didn't want to waste time with him being on my phone. There was always a pressure to be better.\n\nI dismissed many of these because of the good times, when he held my hand when I was sick from my IUD, when he would make me dinner after a long day, when we would actually feel like a family, when we would sit and watch silly Netflix shows in bed. He motivated me to do a lot of good things, go to the gym, wear sunscreen, and eat better.\n\nWhat I hate the most is that I hate myself for wanting to call him up right now. That I hate the kiss we shared so briefly in the car while I was trying to deescalate the situation, will be our last. I miss his warmth, the look in his eye when he looked at me. I have no one in this city to turn to. Nobody to hang out with as I have been isolated.\n\nHe does love me, but he hurt me, and thus, I deserve better. And for that, I will never trust him again. I miss what we could have had, and did have at some moments; where we both supported, encouraged, and loved each other. We discussed a future we all yearn for of a happy family, and it felt to attainable and within reach. I learned a lot from this relationship, and I just hope someone good is out there to build something actually good with me.",

To make the long story short, I messaged one of my team leaders via slack to request for a vacation leave a month before, I know that she havent finished the schedule yet but the reason I informed her is so she can also take note of my request for those days. I know that I can also file this at our company internal site but  this is what i did twice before so I didn't know it was an issue until I saw her message in our group slack an hour after I sent her a personal message. So basically her message in the group is about the vacation leave policy request and what really annoyed me is when she said \"if there is something urgent do not hesitate to tell me and you are already intellegent enough to be able to distinguish whether or not what you are going to ask can be done.\". I'm pretty sure she is pertaining to my message and I was wondering if I said something wrong coz my message is just asking for an approval for my request. She did not reply my message and I wasnt sure if will still message her about it. Do you think I'm just being too petty about this?",

I don’t want to pack up and move anymore, I want to have a community and friends and get to nest somewhere. We’ve decided to settle down and start a family in the next few years, but we just can’t decide where. It’s been a huge source of angst and friction. Every option has a big sacrifice attached to it. Our families are both spread out across the LA and Bay areas, but we don’t even know if we want to stay in California since it’s just so expensive. We don’t want to grind so hard just to exist, but we just can’t figure out how to buy a home in California without spending all our time working like crazy just to finance it. We want time with the children that we bring into this world before they grow up. Neither of us are excited about living in either the Bay or LA, but that’s where our family and friends are. We want a child-friendly city with space, walkability, nature, local cafes and classes, safety, lack of shallow and materialistic judgment, clean air, community, and driving distance to our loved ones. I could work remotely but my husband would probably need to be near a city for work. It just feels like such a place doesn’t exist :/ And so we keep putting off the decision. But we can’t do that forever, I just don’t know what to do. I feel a hopelessness and dread about the future, it is shapeless and exhausting",

Honestly, he has unexpected rages that bother me. He is a teacher and I’m a healthcare worker. He makes 35k a year while I make 150k, so I pay the bills 9/10 times when eating out. Anyway, we recently traveled and had some food and I ordered some extra for to go. I tipped 15%, and I saw that he was unhappy but I didn’t know what happened. When we got back to the hotel, he yelled at me that I was selfish because I make a lot of money. This is my first time year working after college, so I honestly haven’t saved much. He went on and lectured that the waitress could have been a single mom. I was so angry because I paid for all his food, too, and the bill was over 100 dollars. The trip was ruined and he didn’t talk to me for two days then finally talked to me a day before the trip ended.\n\n\nI’m considering breaking up with him. Am I reasonable?",

        "text": "**I was close to my dad, VERY close to the point I'm obsess with my dad. I lost my dad in my adulthood so it was HARD on me. I blame myself alot for watch my father deteriorate and die slowly (he died of Alzhemier) and there was nothing I can do to help, and the only way I can pay this back for this guilt is die with my dad.**\n\nWhen my dad died, I think of end my life all the times. The only reason why I'm still here is because of my husband, as long as he still here with me, I won't do anything stupid. I basically have no more will to live since my father death, and what keep me breathing like now is my husband still with me. My obsession with my father, and I can't let this go, it been decade long.\n\nMy mother also died, but she few years ago of stroke. But my problem here is my obsesison with my father.  Chinese they say girls loves their dad the most, boys love their mom. This is 100% true in my case. \n\nI'm married 11 years, and since the **FIRST** year of my marriage I already show my violent ways, so my husband endure this violent me decade long.\n\nI have this obsession with my **father** (I was daddy girl, I look up to my father, I never love anyone more than I love my father), when my father died I did think of end my life many times, the only reason I'm still living right now is because of my husband. So if my husband one day gone too, I will be gone. \n\nIn the 11 years span of my marriage, I'm this raging woman when my anger flares up to the point I can't control myself and I'm even scare of my own violent.\n\nI will give examples of how I abuse him, and HE willingly to let me abuse him if that helps me. One of the thing I regret the most is this incident where I abuse him so bad. And this was in the first few years of our marriage.\n\n**I scream told him to lay on the floor and I repeatedly use all my strength and kick him at his back his thighs, etc.., I aim at his thigh and his knee and use all my strength (to vent my anger), I kick him to the point blood were bleeding under his skin, it blue and purple blood because it bleed under his skin, and the next day gravity pull all that blood from his knee down to his ankle. His whole leg were swollen up that it was so hard when touch and the pool of blood follow gravity pull it from his knee all the way down to his ankle.**\n\nNo, I don't violently kick him like this anymore as I honestly regret this. But I still hit him whenever I get mad.\n\nHe never report it to the authority, he said he willingly to let me abuse him if that what make me happy.\n\nAlso, everytime I get mad is I throw water in his face, from ice tea to water, I just go to the kitchen, grab a bucket fill up the water and aim at his face and throw at him. I even boil water and think of throw the hot boil water his face, but then yeah, that will burn his face, so I stop myself.\n\nToday before he left to work, on the dinner table I slap him twice across his face. Last time I was mad I grab a Chinese magazine and throw it at his face that it cut right where his eyebrow is, a bit lower it would go right in his eyes.\n\nNo, I'm not a helpless woman, I owns 2 guns, in fact I have a gun right here at the bedside and one right here next to the table. Sure, my husband got jealous of a male childhood friend hugged me at the supermarket and that night he force himself on me have sex with me against my will, but that happened 6 years ago. While 10 years ago I already began my violent ways with due to the death of my father. But we not talking about my husband, we talking about ME, the violent me.\n\nI tried to control myself and this lasted a few weeks where I go I don't hit my husband, but then any little thing that remind me of the death of my father, that I no longer have my father, I went into this raging mode and I started to hit him again.\n\nYes, I am da-mn fortunate that he has not call the authority on me, and willingly to let me abused him in this 11 years long marriage. Tbh, I still think of die with my father, but because of my husband that is why I'm still breathing right now, as long as he still here I won't do anything stupid. I don't enjoy life anymore since my father gone. And my husband is the reason why I'm still alive right now. I don't know why but the death of my father affect me this much to the point I become a mad woman.\n\nI did think of counseling, but I'm the type of woman that will slam the door in the counselor face and leave because I simply don't want to go to counseling. I only have one question: **can PTSD from the death of my father caused me to become like this? I'm obsess with my father to the point that I want to die with my father, but I'm still breathing right now is because my husband is still with me by my side, if one day my husband gone, I will go with my father**. I just want my father, to the point I get mad and take it out on my marriage, and my husband has to suffer this.",

        "text": "So I recently (a few months ago) changed my career from working in libraries to beauty retail and I really regret it. \n\nNot only that, I burned bridges at the university library I was working at. I left the job after only about five months of working there because I hated the manager in that job. And was extremely bored and understimulated. Most shifts there was virtually nothing to do. \n\nPrior to the university library job, I worked in a public library in my hometown and really enjoyed it. It was the best job I'd ever had. So I assumed a university library in the city I was moving to would be great too. \n\nIt wasn't. At all. My manager was disengaged and uncaring about the teams performance and staff. There was mostly nothing to do all day, and I genuinely worried the lack of meaning to my days would lead to a depressive episode. \n\nI was pissed off as I felt shortchanged and made no secret of how I felt about the job before I left. So basically burned all my bridges there, stupidly. \n\nMy new retail job is closer to a better fit for me, but it is very physically demanding. Management is exploitative and would work us to death if they could. To the point they made me return to work too soon after having covid and caused me to have a symptom relapse. \n\nI've also seen a couple of opportunities come up for jobs at the university I just left that looked amazing, including an art gallery internship at the gallery there. I'm gutted because I've realized if I hadn't knee jerk reacted, made a scene and left. Without trying to make things work. I'd probably have been able to just change departments to one of those roles. \n\nI feel quite sick about it right now. I'm realizing even though the university job was far from ideal and j felt lonely and alienated, it was cushy compared to how I'm treated in my new job. \n\nHave you ever made a seriously dumb career mistake or burned bridges? How did you come back from it?",

        "text": "I need some input. I'm really struggling with a ton of stuff lately. I'm on a bariatric surgery program and recently found out that I have a gastric ulcer. I'm also being screened for Breast cancer and I'm a BIRADS 3 patient. I've started at a new job, and I've had three roles in two years, have been through 3 months long training sessions, and I think I'm on my ninth supervisor. I'm on a waiting list for a psycho-educational assessment because I believe I'm on the spectrum. So I've got all that going for me, which is nice. \n\nThis week has been exceptionally hard. I cried every morning this week as I sat down at my desk. I finally reached out to my EAP today for some resources. My partner came home at his usual time and I was finishing up some final notes on my work day, but I told him the elevator 30 second pitch on what my day had been like. \n\nI had a friend who was messaging me, wanting to hang out and I had to respond and say that I just didn't have the emotional bandwidth for anyone but my partner and we had a date night - which was true. So I took him to the library for fun, and then we went to grab a bite to eat. I was talking about my day, and things I was learning about myself, when my partner whipped out his phone. I asked, \"Did you get a textt?\" He said no, he was texting his daughter. Then he looked at me, and said, \"What, are you mad now?\" I just started crying in the middle of the restaurant and said, \"NO. I'm sad. I hope you enjoyed your dinner. I want to go home now.\" \n\nI fucking HATE crying in public. \n\nWe didn't speak all the way home. I just found it unspeakably rude. He didn't apologize or anything. It'd be one thing if this was the first time that he indicated that he was not interested in listening to me, but this has been going on for a year. I'm so hurt and feel so finished with this. Admittedly, my past relationships were horrifically abusive, physically and sexually. And so I met this guy and I wasn't afraid of him, and so that was my barometer. Turns out, being ignored and neglected can feel just as bad. In some ways, getting punched was better, because there was always that apology and honeymoon phase that came after. The blunt, \"what, are you mad?\" thing was just ... unbelievably tone deaf and quite frankly, *stupid*. \n\nI don't know if I want to even try fixing this? Do I bother? I'm so burnt out. Advice? Experience? Questions? \n\nMy advice to myself is: Next time, go out with the friend.",

I’m just feeling irritated after a 20 something at my company asked me to be the one to find the time to reschedule a 1:1 with her, for a meeting she asked for and is the owner of, while I have a 103 fever. Ironically it was a meeting for “career advice.”\n\nSo, as a millennial, I did all the grunt work in my 20s, and now in my 30s, I’ve moved into a role where I am an individual contributor. I’ve been a manager but found it wasn’t for me, so I haven’t sought another managerial role. While I’m not directly supervising anyone on my team, my team does have support staff. But the support staff doesn’t want to ever do administrative work?\n\nThis is the third role I’ve had with this kind of scenario, and I love that Gen Z has so much self-confidence and boundaries. But has anyone else noticed that all the grunt/house-keeping work (scheduling meetings, taking notes, general administrative stuff) has started to get pushed back on heavily? \n\nLike, if we were all individual contributors I would get it. If they weren’t support staff I would get it. But it’s irritating to me that this is the third team I’ve worked on where I constantly have to push back on younger staff saying things like “can you Slack me a reminder tomorrow?” and then I have to be like “oh I’ll probably forget - I’d recommend you make a task in our task management system with a due date of tomorrow.” \n\nThis also doesn’t take into consideration the fact that everyone above me also doesn’t seem to actually enjoy leading? So when we need to get a project completed, I feel like it’s always the 35-40 year olds who have to push the team towards a decision, even if we aren’t the final decision makers. Meanwhile the 20somethings contribute by saying “let’s just not do this project.” (Which is sometimes valid but sometimes you do have to come to work and…work?)\n\nI just feel like being stuck between older folks that seem conflict avoidant when decisions need to be made and younger people who…I honestly don’t really know what they do all day is just the norm now for millennials? I had one Gen Z team member blow off a key meeting with me with no notice to go watch The World Cup at a bar down the street, so they could be doing anything they want I guess. I brought it up to my boss and it got handwaved away.\n\nMeanwhile, it’s the women my age who are stuck doing all the work and we’re the ones who have the 50 hour work. I already did the 50 hour week thing as support staff to get to where I am. Is this just going to always be the millennial condition in perpetuity since the Great Recession? Should I just start not doing work and leave it all to the other 5/30 people in my department who seem to keep everything afloat?",

I really admire and respect my SO’s work and career. \n\nWhen it is just the two of us, there is never a problem –my SO is great and would never make me feel lesser. My Partner is very supportive of me and my goals. We have also done a great job balancing the budget so that we pay for the bills “equitably” rather than “equally.”\n\nBut I definitely feel the pinch socially… My acquaintance once joked: “how did you bag someone in \\[insert profession here\\]!” (I know it’s in jest, but it’s awkward and it stings)... Meanwhile, when we have family gatherings, both of our families eagerly ask for updates on my partner’s career, but they forget to ask for updates about my job or the Master’s Degree I’m chipping away at. \n\nThis is probably a \"me thing,\" but... I generally don’t feel like I fit in at networking events as my Partner's Plus One. It’s exhausting to only ever meet MBAs, JDs, and PHDs, even if they’re super nice to me. (Even other SO’s are highly educated, and often have interesting careers of their own). I feel like a bit of a black sheep in these situations.\n\nI go through phases of feeling pretty down about myself and my own level of career success.

She is the sweetest person I know and she’s given everything to take care of me and my brother, all by herself.\n\nMy mom was born in Australia and had to move to where we live now (NL) when she was 10 years old. She always was homesick for Australia, even now. She saved up for decades until a few years ago I went with her, back to Australia. It was her first time back in her birth country in 40 years. This meant a lot to me aswell. \nWe travelled for 5 weeks and even though I tried my hardest to see the beauty of the journey, I was miserable and irritated most of the time. My mother is lovely but those 5 weeks really pulled out that deep gut wrenching irritation against your parents that starts in puberty and apparently only went away because I moved out. The tiniest things she did would annoy me. It was so bad that I could not fully enjoy the trip, all the while feeling incredibly for feeling this way to her. To be fair, I’m a very independent person and travelling alone is what I prefer.\n\nNow, she wants to go again. Personally I would love to go back to Australia. I love the country and have been planning on going back to travel. \n\nNow I’m torn. I really want to go to Australia, even with my mom, but I just know I cannot be with her for more than 1-2 week, or I will go crazy.

So I don’t think I can convince her now. On the other hand, I do not have the heart to tell her that she drives me mad after travelling together for too long. I think she will not understand.\n\nI need help. What do I do? Maybe there is a platform where she can meet other female travelers of similar age? Or I could show her options for group trips? Or do I just not go at all? But if I don’t go, it means that she won’t go too, and that means she will have to throw out her dream of going back one more time for the last time in her life..",

We saw them for Thanksgiving then they asked when in December they could visit too. We had to say that wouldn’t work because we had other things planned and you know LIFE, so they came this week. We just got back from a week being gone seeing my family and just have zero energy for more family gathering- we just want the weekend at home. Of course my husband will take our daughter to visit but I am largely making myself scarce. I feel sort of bad but also they never really ask when is a good time to visit, they just make their plans then expect that we are together all weekend. It’s a lot.\n\nSo next month is my FIL’s bday and my husband and daughter will fly out to celebrate; I’m in school and am staying home to work on things. I think they understand but I still feel a bit guilty.\n\nAnyone else navigate a situation like this?",

Just as we were getting to a place where our love (and sex) lives were finding a balance again, her body began to change and she’s going through menopause. Now I go from hero to asshole in seconds, seemingly without warning. \n\nI’ve made good money over the years so we can be comfortable, but cancer put a serious damper on my ability to earn when my employer did some shady shit around that. I’m not with them anymore and now am rebuilding my career, which takes time I wasn’t planning on putting in in my 40s. This takes me out of the home when I feel like I should be there the most, but I don’t have much choice.\n\nThrough that I want to still make sure I’m supportive of her and her needs. I need to make my hours there count. Those who have gone through it, what are things your spouse or partner did that were amazing? (Somewhat selfishly, but only because her pleasure is my favourite thing) was there anything that brought back a dwindling sex drive as you went through it that your partner did? She’s lost interest in receiving massages or oral - those were my way of giving her pleasure before cancer. \n\nSigned, clueless husband who isn’t at all prepared for menopause.",

I am asking why women who are older seem to be angered/annoyed by men who date down in age.\n\nMany older women stop caring to do things that attract the opposite sex like working out, shaving/waxing on a regular basis, and wearing makeup. Combine that with the fact that women who are older either don't want kids or want to have kids relatively soon after meeting, why would men not just date down in age?\n\nI understand that many women will immediately argue that the man wants to \"prey\" on the young woman's innocence/naivety and while I grant that is sometimes true, it is not always the case. I think that to assume every instance of an age gap is automatically predatory is infantilizing young women which I find to be incompatible with modern feminist thought.\n\nThank you for all replies in advance.

For example, the  last time I bought pastries for breakfast post stay/romp, I noticed the  guy in this situation ate 2 out of 3 of them without asking me if I  wanted any. Just automatically ate them. Which I found to be interesting  bc I would never do that and I always offer/women are socialized to  offer/you get the drill\n\nthis is not the 1st guy i've had to point this out to though\n\ni'm just...so...over it\n\nas  i said, not articulating this well, but are you ladies feeling this too  or did you feel this way? i turned 30 a few months ago and this has  been something that sprung up a bit before then but it's been a lot\n\ni have a younger 20 yo brother i am constantly having these convos with as well about\n\nhopefully this post makes sense? would appreciate your insights/experiences/advice",

I (31F) have a friend (26F) who very often mentions the suicide of her friend four years ago and the years of depression and amount of burnouts (her own diagnosis, never went to a professional) she already had in her life. Her father probably has been very abusive in her teenage years as well. She only tells snippets of the things that happened to her (or her dead friend) and if I ask any further questions because she mentions those things almost every time we meet she just says things like \"you don't want to know\" or \"nobody else could have experienced something worse than me\" which I find quite ignorant. I believe her that a lot of very bad and traumatic things happened to her and I think I really would feel sorry for a lot of them if she didn't always say it like nobody else in the world has ever experienced something as bad as she did.\n\nI dropped out of school because of massive social anxiety, my father died in my early twenties, I also had years of depression (diagnosed and treated) and suffered from painful chronic illness for fifteen years. It's not like I didn't have my share of bad experiences either. And I'd still say myself that she probably had it worse than me. At least from what I know. But I'm seriously losing any of the compassion that I had in the beginning because she always makes it sound like a challenge who had it worse. It doesn't matter to me. Everyone has their struggles and traumatic experiences you just can't compare them. \n\nIt feels like she actually does want to talk seriously about those things but whenever I try to ask about it after she brings it up again she doesn't want to anymore. Then she suddenly becomes the strong woman who can do anything because she survived those experiences and \"treated\" her trauma by herself by having several burnouts. However that's supposed to work. And no, she definitely won't talk to a professional.\n\nI'm totally open about talking with her about those things and just listening to her if she wants to. But I feel like she just wants me to acknowledge and pity her for her traumatic past which I know almost nothing about but get reminded of at least three times a week. I'm really losing my compassion which makes me feel bad. I don't want that. But it's hard to feel sorry when it's all about \"see how hard my life is/was!\".\n\nI think she's currently mad because I texted her that I really don't understand what she wants from me. Does she want to talk about it and if not why mention it all the time? Am I supposed to ask about it or should I simply ignore it because it's something that comes up that often? I'm really at a loss right now.",

I worked and lived in a city where I enjoyed my job and went to a gym where I loved taking classes. I traveled often - for work and pleasure - in the US and abroad. I saw my friends frequently and loved to cook, hosted book clubs, frequented restaurants and breweries, did lots of hiking, and wrote in a personal blog. \n\nSince the pandemic I feel like I have lost myself. My job is now 90% remote, I moved to the suburbs, and I barely see my friends. I no longer enjoy my job, which once brought me a lot of fulfillment and satisfaction. My former hobbies no longer interest me and feel forced. I feel extremely lazy and the thought of doing anything…like rejoining a gym, finding a new job, planning trips / going to the airport…just exhausts me. While I work out regularly on my Peloton bike (a pandemic purchase when my gym permanently closed) I feel unmotivated to push myself and like I’m just going through the motions. I gained a lot of weight over the last few years and have not been able/motivated to lose it. When I lived in the city I used to walk everywhere. Now in the suburbs I drive everywhere. Everything is further away and involves sitting in traffic. I don’t have any goals. I feel like I’m just trudging along, endlessly scrolling social media, watching TV, and making excuses. \n\nMy husband and I are are talking about starting a family soon. I feel resentful of the two years lost to the pandemic and all of the traveling and plans that were cancelled. While I’m excited to start a family, I know life will change drastically and it will be even more challenging to “find myself” again. \n\nI’m not sure where to go from here. Therapy has helped me in the past through a horrible relationship/breakup and the death of a parent. These problems seem so small comparatively - it doesn’t even feel fair to call them problems. Has anyone else dealt with these feelings over these last few years? How did you “find yourself” again?",

        "text": "With \"pretty privilege\" seemingly on our collective minds, I wonder if men favor pretty women *as much* if they're mothers or women with lots of experience with men. And by experience, I mean not the good kind. The kind of experience that leaves you exasperated and irritated with men. \n\nI'm speaking as someone who used to be very pretty and am now just very average. However the other day I heard Emily Ratajkowski talking about how men are \"emasculated\" by confident, strong women. And I started wondering if someone as beautiful as her may *begin* to benefit from \"pretty privilege\" but have that privilege yanked away once a man discovers she's not going to put up with his shit. \n\nSo are pretty privileges granted by men tied up with the expectation that a pretty woman will also obey his commands and serve him in some way? I'm finding it very hard to believe that sexist expectations and pretty privilege aren't wholly intertwined. Which nullifies the idea of pretty privilege being something we can realistically complain about (since it isn't so much a privilege as an expectation from men).\n\nAnyway, make what you will of my brain soup and I'd love to read your comment if you have anything relevant to share. Thanks for reading.",

Does anyone actually want pants without pockets? After my late 20s, I feel like I would rather have pockets than look \"sexy\" in pocket-less clothes. I have always been told \"many women must not want pockets\" or \"many women want to look sexy in tight pants with no pockets\". Idk, after hitting 30, I feel like most of my friends are at least a little chubby and want something more practical. Since most adult women who buy pants are +30 and are normal women not models, who wants pocketless/small pocket pants and why? And how is this still the norm?\n\nHonestly, I want cargo pants to come back.",

        "text": "For context. I spent yesterday on a 20 km hike. As I reached my destination, a seaside resort, I walked past a number of restaurants. A group of women, mid-twenties to early thirties, was sitting near the window in one of the restaurants. I noticed them while they were staring at me and then they glanced at each other and started talking among themselves. They were kind of giggling or laughing, but not quite. When I looked back a few seconds later, I saw them staring again.\n\nI am not that great at interpreting body language, so I was wondering: could you shed some light on this? I am curious: what could have gone through their minds?\n\nWhere they checking me out of did I draw their attention in some other way? It had been drizzling and I put on my hoodie earlier, which might have messed with my hair. I also was tired from having walked all day and I don’t really care about fashion sense when I’m hiking, so may clothes may have been a mismatch colour wise.",

There are others who totally love me and I became their teacher’s pet. I have extended relatives who hated me and would make up lies that I was being mean to them because of my mean look. I was always chasing after guys and they didn’t respect me at all. Anything I did was considered wrong and offensive to them. \n\nAs I got older, I realized that the thing I could do was have the brightest personality, which I eventually adopted. Many people loved hanging with me because I could dance and was fun. However, there are countless individuals who chose not to befriend me until they found out that I was among the cool group of dancers. At bars, guys would completely ignore me when I’m with my friends. I don’t expect them to hit on me, but they would ask everyone questions except me. The guys I’ve dated told me they loved me for my personality, and honestly, most of them couldn’t get hard. \n\n\nEverything changed until I went to Korea and got my underbite fixed through surgeries. I did my eyes and nose. I basically spent 40k (including food, lodging, surgeries, and personal spendings when abroad). \n\nMy life dramatically changed. People were nice to me for no reason. I was always the same person. Everyone loves me for no reason. People treat me differently at work. There’s no more crazy work bullying. Guys hit on me everyday. Some even buy me gifts and offer to pay my rent. I honestly could careless about all these vicious people who only like me for my look. Humans are evil. Pretty privilege is real.",

I'm also Nigerian, meaning that boys were a taboo growing up. But now, a lot of my friends and acquaintances are in relationships, getting engaged or even getting in relationships. Whenever I go to a party (I rarely leave my house), it seems that I notice guys watching me and my friends more often. In our culture, dating or courtship should lead to marriage. Anyway, the topic of relationships and marriage just keeps popping up more and more, not with me specifically, but with my older friends, which means it won't be too long until I'm next.\n\nThing is, I feel like I'm going to end up alone because I've never really liked someone enough. I completely lose feelings after a month. Catching feelings in the first place is even rare for me. I don't have unrealistic standards, my head just isn't there rn. School is my main focus and yes, boys are nice, but like a part-time basis. I don't know if I actually want someone or if I'm just thinking I do. \n\nAnyway, my actual question: my friend is very nice and i feel that he has feelings for me to an extent. He buys me food all the time and takes me out for nice friend dates all the time and all. I sometimes worry that he has feelings for me. On my end, he is handsome and I did crush on him at some point, but those feelings died as they always do. But, I'm not attracted to him the way I wish i was. Yet, he is the most gentleman person you could imagine. He opens doors, is a great listener, sweet, isn't stingy with money, but I'm not attracted to him. I don't want to start something due to peer pressure of relationships around me. But at the same time, should I not look for someone who could be compatible with me? Should i give it a chance or no",

        "text": "A few days ago I was going through this thread and found a very common question posted in here about virginity, again. I went to read their comments cause I was bored. I ended up DMing a user who I thought had interesting points and she recommended I asked this question to see more response to women so here it goes:\n\nFirst of all I will start by saying that as a straight man, there is a market for me and the at market is controlled by the consumer, in this case straight women. The same can be said for straight women, gay men, lesbian women, etc. there is a market for them all and there is a group of consumer that decide what makes a person more or less attractive or desirable. \n\nThat’s not to say that every women find the same thing attractive. Of course not, there is obviously differences between people. That is why, using another market as an example, there is so many brands of phones, Samsung, google, plus1, Apple, etc. they all have their little differences, however they all have some big similarities. Some of those would be:\n\n1. Everyone wants good cameras\n2. Everyone wants nice screen\n3. Everyone wants long batteries.\n4. Everyone wants attractive products, etc\n\nJust how there are differences between them and obvious similarities, the market of men, women, etc have some similarities.\n\nExample, in the market for men, obviously not everyone, but a clear trend we see is that women want a competent partner, one that respects them, that takes care of themselves and looks attractive, someone that can please them sexually, etc. I think it is safe to say those are traits that are desired in a man overwhelmingly, but of course not 100%\n\nNow you might think by now “yes I get it, the market. We get it.” Yes. Now that we clarify we control the market, I think it’s safe to say the market of men and women don’t necessarily want the same thing. There is surely some overlap, but there is more differences than not. \nIs that wrong? I certainly would not say so. I personally don’t look for a driven, successful, ambitious partner. Of the men I know in my life none of them look for that either. Does that make them wrong for not caring? No. Should they care? From a logical stand point, maybe. But should we be striving for men and women to have the same standards? I definitely don’t think so.\n\nHere is the I guess controversial part of it.\nAren’t we then our fault for popularizing the other genders faults? A lot of men complain about women only dating them for their money. If that happens, it’s only because we keep dating them and in a way reinforcing them to keep being that way. I talked to that girl about how it’s totally fine for men to want virgins. Her response was “it’s only okay if men ought to be virgins as well.” To which I responded with “I’m not one to declare what is attractive on men. That is on you, women. Men have said what we found attractive, in the topic of sexuality virgins are attractive. There is 3 choices here:\n\n1. Accept that we like different things and move on even if you dislike it\n2. Start to like virgin men as much as men like virgin women to make it equal\n3. Or try to make men find experienced women more attractive somehow.”\n\nThe power is in your hands. We as men don’t mind having different standards. It is women that mind, those are the choices.",

I want to raise my daughter consciously and be the inspiration she needs to grow up to become an emotionally intelligent, hard working, kind, passionate, confident woman. \n\nTo answer this question myself, I love how loving, caring, and supportive my mother was growing up. But I wish she modelled better relationship dynamics for me by standing up for herself and having more courage to leave my father because he mistreated her. She always accepted him back with open arms and the cycle just continued which raised me to accept a whole lot of mistreatment from men in my life. I also wish she didn’t give up her career and goals to take care of him and his business.",
