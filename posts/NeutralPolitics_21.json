I understand how lowering the retirement age subordinates the judiciary - it's a short term move that will require almost half of the council-members to be re-selected by the government. However, I'm unclear as to why the second bill, the one altering how some of Poland's supreme court selection panel is chosen, is considered undemocratic. In the United States, all of our supreme court justices are selected [approved] by congress and Poland's move seems a few steps removed from that. \n\nCriticisms I'm referring to: \n\n&gt; Polish MP: \"A free and independent Supreme Council has just fallen...

[The Hill](http://thehill.com/), (which allsides.com calls center, and mediabiasfactcheck.com calls slightly left leaning.) lists the number as 97 days.\n\nThe 4 days difference may be because there are 4 days left in the year and the President is scheduled to be on vacation at Mar-A-Lago, his luxury club in Florida, the Hill may be limiting themselves to vacation days that actually have taken place.\n\nThe thing that caught my eye was Mar-A-Lago.\n\nA Trump property... \n\nI was mentally equating Trump taking vacation at one of his properties with President Bush taking vacation at his own his ranch in Crawford, Texas, but that didn't sit right.\n\nYou can't rent out time at the Bush ranch.   It is not a for profit institution.\n\n[Mar-A-Lago](http://www.maralagoclub.com/) is.  And so is [Trump Golf](http://www.maralagoclub.com/Default.aspx?p=dynamicmodule&amp;pageid=100008&amp;ssid=100030&amp;vnf=1).\n\nSo two questions come to mind, neither of which I know how to research:\n\n* How much does President Trump personally profit from the taxpayer money spent on his vacation at a Trump owned property?\n\nand the second very similar question, assuming that the President of the United States staying at a given place is a bump to that business going forward because people want to stay someplace the President has stayed:\n\n* Of the Trump properties that the President has stayed at, has there been any pattern of *which* properties and how their business picked up after he stayed?\n\ni.e. has he been intentionally bolstering troubled Trump businesses?",

We do not allow bare expressions of opinion, low effort one-liner comments, jokes, memes, off topic replies, or pejorative name calling.\n\nWe believe this formulation better reflects the ethos of what we're asking of our users on NP.

In that case, a sourced explanation of why the name ascribed is accurate is permitted by the rules.\n\nIn addition, we added language that \"NeutralPolitics is a serious discussion based subreddit.\"  This reflects the general ethos of what we're after here, and also allows for room to remove content which is nonserious but doesn't fit neatly into another rule, such as obvious trolling.\n\nWe are in the process of updating our automod rules to report (not remove) comments which contain keywords which are likely to violate this policy.  To that end, we need your help in composing a list of nicknames and substitute names which are very likely to be in violation of the rules.  We already have slurs and most regular insults in our automod filters - we're just looking for more public figure related ones now.\n\n**Please help us out by giving us a list of names which we can put into automod.**\n\nWe won't take it personally.",

        "text": "Politico reports that the DEA launched an investigation into Hezbollah in 2008, called Project Cassandra, and has evidence that Hezbollah is now a international crime syndicate that \"collects $1 billion a year from drug and weapons trafficking, money laundering and other criminal activities.\"\n\n[Politico reports that](https://www.politico.com/interactives/2017/obama-hezbollah-drug-trafficking-investigation/):\n\n&gt;When Project Cassandra leaders sought approval for some significant investigations, prosecutions, arrests and financial sanctions, officials at the Justice and Treasury departments delayed, hindered or rejected their requests.\n\n&gt;The Justice Department declined requests by Project Cassandra and other authorities to file criminal charges against major players such as Hezbollah’s high-profile envoy to Iran, a Lebanese bank that allegedly laundered billions in alleged drug profits, and a central player in a U.S.-based cell of the Iranian paramilitary Quds force. And the State Department rejected requests to lure high-value targets to countries where they could be arrested.\n\nDavid Asher, a Defense Department illicit finance expert who worked on Project Cassandra, said about the decisions which hindered the project: \n\n&gt;\"This was a policy decision, it was a systematic decision. They serially ripped apart this entire effort that was very well supported and resourced, and it was done from the top down.\"\n\nJohn Brennan, Obama's top counterterrorism adviser and then CIA director wrote that:\n\n&gt;“the next president has the opportunity to set a new course for relations between the two countries” through not only a direct dialogue, but “greater assimilation of Hezbollah into Lebanon’s political system.”\n\nWhy would Brennan want Hezbollah to have more political power?\n\nIn 2010, Reuters reported that at a conference in Washington, Brennan said:\n\n&gt;“Hezbollah is a very interesting organization,” Brennan told a Washington conference, citing its evolution from “purely a terrorist organization” to a militia to an organization that now has members within the parliament and the cabinet.\n\n&gt;“There is certainly the elements of Hezbollah that are truly a concern to us what they’re doing. And what we need to do is to find ways to diminish their influence within the organization and to try to build up the more moderate elements,” Brennan said.\n\nAli Fayad, A Lebanese arms dealer \"who had been indicted in U.S. courts on charges of planning the murders of U.S. government employees, attempting to provide material support to a terrorist organization and attempting to acquire, transfer and use anti-aircraft missiles\" was arrested in Prague in 2014. He was in custody for 2 years, but\n\n&gt;top Obama administration officials declined to apply serious pressure on the Czech government to extradite him to the United States, even as Putin was lobbying aggressively against it.\n\n&gt;He is now believed by U.S. officials to be back in business, and helping to arm militants in Syria and elsewhere with Russian heavy weapons.\n\nKatherine Bauer, a Treasury official under Obama, [testified in February 2017](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4329058-Katherine-Bauer-testimony-to-the-House-Committee.html) that\n\n&gt;“under the Obama administration … these [Hezbollah-related] investigations were tamped down for fear of rocking the boat with Iran and jeopardizing the nuclear deal.”\n\nPolitico adds to this by reporting:\n\n&gt;As a result, some Hezbollah operatives were not pursued via arrests, indictments, or Treasury designations that would have blocked their access to U.S. financial markets, according to Bauer, a career Treasury official, who served briefly in its Office of Terrorist Financing as a senior policy adviser for Iran before leaving in late 2015. And other “Hezbollah facilitators” arrested in France, Colombia, Lithuania have not been extradited — or indicted — in the U.S., she wrote.\n\nDavid Asher said that\n\n&gt;“The closer we got to the [Iran deal], the more these activities went away. So much of the capability, whether it was special operations, whether it was law enforcement, whether it was [Treasury] designations — even the capacity, the personnel assigned to this mission — it was assiduously drained, almost to the last drop, by the end of the Obama administration.”\n\nAfter the Iran deal was put into place,\n\n&gt;within months, task force officials said, Project Cassandra was all but dead. Some of its most senior officials, including Jack Kelly, the veteran DEA supervisory agent who created and led the task force, were transferred to other assignments. And Asher himself left the task force long before that, after the Defense Department said his contract would not be renewed.\n\n&gt;As a result, the U.S. government lost insight into not only drug trafficking and other criminal activity worldwide, but also into Hezbollah’s illicit conspiracies with top officials in the Iranian, Syrian, Venezuelan and Russian governments — all the way up to presidents Nicolas Maduro, Assad and Putin, according to former task force members and other current and former U.S. officials.\n\nDerek Maltz, who oversaw Project Cassandra as the head of the DEA’s Special Operations Division for nine years, said:\n\n&gt;“Certainly there are targets that people feel that could have been indicted and weren’t. There is certainly an argument to be made that if tomorrow all the agencies were ordered to come together and sit in a room and put all the evidence on the table against all these bad guys, that there could be a hell of a lot of indictments.”\n\n&gt;“There’s no doubt in my mind now that the focus was this Iran deal and our initiative was kind of like a fly in the soup,”\n\n[Politico article](https://www.politico.com/interactives/2017/obama-hezbollah-drug-trafficking-investigation/)",

I'm making this post because I want to know more, but I've hit a brick wall in my own reading.\n\nAs well as being a proponent and activist for women's rights, Lucy Komisar has been an active voice against off-shore tax havens, and has helped to expose corrupt business dealings in the past. In 2011, \"she did an exposé of the food service company Sodexo for In These Times and [The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/04/opinion/sunday/school-lunches-and-the-food-industry.html?ref=opinion&amp;pagewanted=all), which led to its $20 million settlement with New York State.\" ([Investigative Fund](http://www.theinvestigativefund.org/reporter/lucykomisar/))\n\nRecently, [she has become preoccupied](https://twitter.com/LucyKomisar) with the apparent hypocrisy of Bill Browder's fight using the Magnisky act. She has attacked Browder with claims of his company's own misuse of tax havens and defrauding. She claims that Browder has been using Magnitsky's story to protect himself from legitimate prosecution by Russia.\n\nI don't know enough about finance to tell if all or even some of Komisar's claims are true. In [this recent article](http://www.thekomisarscoop.com/2017/12/did-doj-collude-with-william-browder-to-scuttle-settlement-with-politically-connected-russian-it-accused-of-money-laundering/), she asks \"Did DOJ collude with William Browder\" to block Prevezon holdings from being able to pay the $6 million settlement for the US case against it ([settled in May this year](http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/07/12/doj-settled-massive-russian-fraud-case-involving-lawyer-who-met-with-trump-jr/)). She includes document references in her article, but I just don't know enough about all this. Are her claims here legitimate, or is this some kind of hit job article?\n\nAnother article on her [website](http://www.thekomisarscoop.com/) makes accusations against Browder that he [participated in the same kind of illegitimate financial dealings](http://www.thekomisarscoop.com/2014/06/russian-sanctions-highlight-role-of-western-enablers/) that he accuses others of. Is there any truth to these claims? And if so, does it matter? Does it also make any difference in the case for the Magnitsky act, or Browder's efforts against corporate corruption worldwide?\n\nIn [this article](http://www.thekomisarscoop.com/2017/11/browder-the-cyprus-investigation-what-is-he-hiding/), she claims Browder \"has blocked the Russians from investigating how he may have used shell companies in offshore Cyprus to fraudulently move assets out of Russia.\" She uses a trail of legal documents to make her case, but it seems to me that this secret moving of funds was because Russia was going to drop the hammer on Browder and his company. Why would Komisar take Russia's side in this case, then, given her background?\n\n\n*\nEDIT:\n\nJust to clear some things up. I was mainly curious because Komisar's claims seem out of place given her background. Reading more about Browder's story leads me to believe that her claims are not only unfounded, but [work to actively discredit](http://www.thekomisarscoop.com/category/thebrowderhoax/) documented evidence of the [Kremlin's abuse of Magnitsky](http://russian-untouchables.com/docs/Prison-Diaries-Magnitsky-General-Prosecutor-Complaint.pdf). Also, [not everyone in Russia is so quick to agree](https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/1276590?isSearch=True;) with the Kremlin's official story of Magnitsky's death, and there are [lists of formal complaints to all officials complicit in his abuse](https://www.scribd.com/document/134085731/Smrule-of-Law-List).\n\n",

        "text": "I'd start with this NYT article from mid-November https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/12/opinion/corporate-tax-cuts-gop.html\n\nIt seems to me like the current corporate tax rate structure is poorly structured, set at 35% despite the average tax actually paid being around 18%. This explains to me why I've been seeing somewhat bipartisan support for reforming the corporate tax rate. https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-bipartisan-plan-to-cut-corporate-taxes-1509487574\n\nIt seems that both parties mostly agree that the current corporate tax structure doesn't work very well, incentivizing sheltering profits overseas. It also seems that both parties want to find ways to repatriate these profits. So it seems to me that one of the central tenants of this new tax proposal - cutting the corporate tax rate to 21% while \"closing loopholes\" - is fundamentally agreed upon by both parties. So question 1: \n\n* How effectively does the current proposal actually simplify/improve the corporate tax code? From a simplistic perspective, seeing that the actual tax paid is around 18%, saying \"We'll lower the rate to 21% and close loopholes that allow corporations to get from 35% to 18%\" seems like a common-sense idea. How well is this actually reflected in the current bill? \n\nNext, it seems pretty much universally accepted that companies are sheltering huge amounts of profits outside of the US, and that this is bad for the US economy. https://itep.org/fortune-500-companies-hold-a-record-26-trillion-offshore/ This leads to question 2: \n\n* What are the options the US has to incentivize/force companies to repatriate overseas assets? What are the pros/cons of these options? Also just from an economic perspective, how is it more affordable for companies to \"sit on\" this money to hide it from taxes, rather than paying the taxes and then having this money available to grow their businesses. Is it a gamble that the cost of reinvesting will drop before their money depreciates significantly, or am I totally misunderstanding this situation? \n\nFinally, domestic reinvestment. Both parties' goal seems to be to have these companies repatriate their foreign funds and reinvest them into the American economy. The main conflict here between the parties seems to be expectations vs reality: the conservative argument claims that if companies are able to repatriate at reasonable rates, then companies will reinvest that money which will lead to higher wages and more jobs (either directly or indirectly). https://www.investors.com/politics/commentary/how-corporate-tax-reform-can-grow-the-economy-restore-jobs-and-lift-wages/ On the other hand, liberals claim that if companies are able to cheaply repatriate their overseas funds they will reinvest through share buy-backs and dividends, and not through increased jobs or wages. In additions, they argue that this will effectively reward companies for having hid their funds from US taxation. So, question three: \n\n* How reasonable is it to expect that a lower corporate tax rate will incentivize companies to repatriate their overseas funds, and what should we expect from this reinvestment? Is it reasonable to expect that this will lead to higher wages are more jobs, or should we expect the companies to increase shareholder values while keeping employee numbers and wages stagnant? \n\nIn summary, from all that I've read I get the impression that lowering the corporate tax rate and convincing companies to repatriate their overseas funds has bipartisan support, but that the particular implementation differs. I'm looking for some level-headed discussion of the issues, rather than these increasingly polemic op-eds I keep seeing. \n\nEdit: I changed question 2 entirely. \n\n",
