        "text": "In 1996, a man named Mark Gleeson died after he deliberately shoved tampons up his nostrils to cure his snoring problem, caused by an accident which damaged his nose. He suffocated in his sleep because he couldn't breathe through his nose at all. The titles of the news articles are worded in a way they imply that him not being able to breathe through his nose is what caused his death.\n\nMy friend had a rhinoplasty so after the surgery he had nasal packing, completely blocking his nose. Nasal packing is having surgical tampons in the nose, meaning my friend can't breathe at all through his nose.\n\nFor anyone who will say ''people get stuffy noses when they have a cold and they sleep fine'', having nasal tampons up your nose is completely different from congestion from a cold. Both nostrils never become completely blocked from snot and swollen sinuses, like it is with nasal packing. The two scenarios are in no way comparable. Even if you have a really bad cold, some air can still move past the nose.",

I've tried looking up the definition of pathophysiological mechanism on its own to see if it would lead me in the right direction, and nothing. Any description on the word alone would be extremely appreciated. Thank you!",

I'd love some clarity and a different opinion on my reasoning..",

        "text": "I read about (but can not remember where) there being a potential link between the \"mad cow disease\" outbreak in the UK and the rates of dementia in the elderly. There's a theory that the latency period being around 30-40 years before onset of prion symptoms, which would track with the age range of those with elderly dementia now. \n\nI work in microbiology and we've seen an increase in samples sent for vCJD recently and am interested in why. \n\nAm I talking s**t or misremembering? Any help appreciated 👍🏻",

Im aware that calc classes are required and all that and i think i could do the classes successfully, im more concerned with it from a career perspective.",

        "text": "\nHello all. I recently found a new method to strip PVDF membranes after immunoblotting that looked promising for then probing with another antibody. It worked reasonably well the first time, however the second time (roughly 2 weeks later) it turned my PVDF translucent. I used the same stock solution and added BME directly prior to use. The stock solution was roughly 2 weeks old but the protocol specifically stated it was stable at room temp without the BME. Ive checked my math about 5 times and had someone else in the lab check it. The math is correct and the solution is exactly the same concentration as previous use. Blots had been stored in TBS-T for roughly a week prior to today. Any idea what could’ve caused this or how to remedy? \n\nSolution:\n6M GnHCl\n0.2% NP-40\n0.1 M BME\n20mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.5",
