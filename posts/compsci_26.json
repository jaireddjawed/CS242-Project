        "text": "As a programming project, I had an idea for implementing a decentralised system for storing shared state of n nodes(each node will store info about all other nodes).\n\n**Problem description**\n\nEach node generates events and I want each event to be propagated to all nodes. What I'm thinking of is all nodes arranging themselves into a Hamiltonian cycle and each node only pushing events forward to the next node in the ring topology.\n\nGossip protocols give probabilistic guarantees whereas this will guarantee that an event is propagated to all nodes at most (n-1)t time after it is generated(which is best case scenario for any unicast based gossip protocols) .\n\n**Practical scenario** \n\nOne concrete use case I'm thinking of is when you have a set of hosts behind a load balancer, e.g. in an AWS Autoscaling Group. And you want to maintain a shared state without using any centralised system other than the LB. Since this autoscales, new hosts can spin up or existing hosts can shutdown.\n\n(I'm wondering if what I'm thinking of would even have any practical use. Why would you avoid a centralised event collector? Each host anyway has to keep track of all other hosts' events leading to O(n) resource requirements per host).\n\nEach host would know the domain name/IP which the load balancer is bound to, but only its own individual IP address. By querying the LB it can hit any node randomly and ask it to respond with its IP address.\n\n**Progress** \n\nI think the entire problem here is how to form and maintain a ring topology.\n\nFormation : \n\n\nEach node is initially a trivial cycle(with a self loop). Each node keeps pinging the LB. When nodes Ai and Bj, in cycles A and B respectively, become aware of each other, join the cycles as Ai-&gt;B(j+1), Bj-&gt;A(i+1)[node i in any cycle forwards events to node (i+1)%n where n is cycle size]\n\n(Can't subscript on reddit; does r/compsci have special css sauce that allows it?)\n\nWe would need each node to maintain its 'cycle ID'(for node pairs to be able to check if they belong to the same cycle). Each node when it starts up, randomly generates its own Cycle ID from a large enough pool as to make collisions improbable.\n\nAnd of course on every cycle-join event all the nodes of either cycle would have to update their cycle ID(things get tricky here if simultaneous cycle-joins happen - another thing I need to think about).\n\n\nMaintenance :\n\n\nIf a node goes down, its predecessor would have no way of connecting to the successor node and repairing the cycle.  \n\nA few possible approaches to get around this: \n\n + If your successor dies, delink from your cycle, ping the LB and join the cycle(which may be same or different to your current cycle) of the host you get, as a successor of this host(as described in the cycle-join event). Tell your predecessor in the previous cycle to join as your successor in this cycle, next time it pings you.\n\nThis requires each node to also store a flag/timestamp describing when it last switched out from its current position in a cycle. (And possibly you would reply with this at every ping)\n\nIf your successor ever replies with a timestamp value greater than your own, join as its successor in its current cycle.\n\n(Unsure here if a timestamp is needed or a boolean flag that flips every repositioning would suffice).\n\n + Instead of cycle ID, each node stores addresses of all nodes in its cycle. Thus if your successor dies, you successively ping next nodes. If all are dead, do 1.\n\nThis increases space overhead per node to O(n) from (1) and communication complexity to O(n) from O(1) per node for cycle-join events. In the event of a node dying, every node in its cycle would have to perform an O(1) update(remove the dead node from the set of addresses)\n\n+ A generalisation of 2, store addresses of your k next nodes. If all k are down, do as in 1. This can handle any kind of sudden death where no k consecutive nodes in a cycle die.\nSpace overhead : O(k), communication complexity : O(k) for O(k) nodes. Total O(k^(2)) vs O(n^(2)).\n \n**SoTA Research** : This is where I need (most of) your help, a literature search!\n\nMaybe my google-fu is really terrible; how do you even search for \"non-gossip dissemination protocols\"? I've tried to prune my search toward Ad-Hoc Wireless Networks since that seems to match my usecase(hosts behind the LB can shutdown or spin up).\n\nIs what I'm thinking of 'pre-gossip'; does the difficulty of maintaining network topology in the face of unpredictable creation and destruction of nodes mean low communication overhead is not possible for a sufficiently robust system? (i.e. anything with lower overhead but equal or greater robustness of gossip is impossible).\n\n",

My professor is really bad at explaining stuff and expects us to be able to solve simple algorithms using stack (e.g. Insertion Sort and Binary Search) but he barely went over on how to manipulate the stack and how to do recursive subroutines. He just posted an extra credit assignment,  ecause most of the class is performing poorly, where we have to do encryption and decryption using XOR and he has never mentioned stuff like that. I don’t know if I hate assembly or I just hate it because of him. So, I was wondering if anyone has a good textbook that give you examples or lecture notes so I can cram all this stuff and finish with a good grade. \n\nEdit: I just wanted to thank everyone who commented.

That's a lot.\n\n\nTask: We have a collection of resumes with us. When a new resume is submitted we want to know if this resume was already submitted to us previously.\n\n\nHere are few things that need to be considered:\n\n\n1. If a resume was submitted 2 years back and again today, then a lot could change. For example, the person got new education degree, changed jobs, learned new languages, changed email address, living in a new country.\n\n2. To avoid detection people will, on purpose, put their name as any of these \"Robert Downey\", \"Robert D\", \"Robert John Downey\". Also, if we have 2 resumes with names \"Alex Hales\", \"Alex Henshaw\" and now we got a resume with name \"Alex H\", we should not consider them the same.\n\n3. Note that people with same full name exist. There are more than 38,000 people named \"James Smith\". (Seriously?)\n\n\n4. Clearly, it's not possible to design a 100% working algorithm in this case. We may have to use a heuristic algorithm. Think of what's best possible.\n\n5. Do not worry about resume PDF format (most common format) to text conversion. Assume all the information is in text format, we only want to think about the core comparison algorithm.\nHow would you compare resumes given the lack of structure?\n\n\nAdditionally, assume we have like 100 million resumes with us. When a new resume is submitted, the naive solution would be to compare it with all 100 million resumes and check if we have a match. Can we do better?",

I'm learning the math I need as I go... I might need to learn some Measure Theory, eventually :(\n\nWe want to determine if an optimization algorithm, say a Genetic Algorithm \\(GA\\), is guaranteed to converge to a global optimum (given enough time).\n\nLet S\\(k\\) be our solution at iteration k, for k = 1,2,....\n\nWe only know two things:\n\n1. **monotonicity**: S\\(k\\+1\\) is at least as good as S\\(k\\).\n2. **positive probability assumption**: there exists eps \\&gt; 0 such that Prob\\(S\\(k\\) is optimum\\) \\&gt; eps for every k.\n\nWhat can we conclude by only using these assumptions?\n\nNote that point 2 makes the assumption that the set of possible solutions is finite.\n\nLet O\\(k\\) = 1 if S\\(k\\) is optimum and 0 otherwise. O\\(k\\) determines a sequence of the form 0^(n)1\\*, i.e. a finite number of zeros followed by infinitely many ones \\(because of monotonicity\\).\n\nThe probability that O\\(1\\),O\\(2\\),...,O\\(k\\) has no \"1\" is less than \\(1\\-eps\\)^(k) which goes to 0 as k goes to infinity, so the probability that S\\(k\\) is an optimum goes to 1 as k goes to infinity.\n\nAlso, if f\\(k\\) is the value of solution S\\(k\\), and f^(\\*) is the value of optimum solutions, then f(k)-&gt;f^\\* with probability 1. Indeed, the probability that there's a neighborhood B of f^\\* which contains no f(k) is **(\\*)** is equal to the limit of the probability that no O(k) is 1, which is 0. This means that f^\\* is an accumulation point for f(k) so there's a subsequence f(k(i)) which converges to f^\\*, but, for the monotonicity, the whole sequence f(k) must then converge to f^\\*.\n\n**(\\*)** Since the probability that O(k) = 0 goes to 0, then the probability that all O(k) are 0 is 0. If this probability were eps&gt;0 then, for every k, P(O(k)=0) &gt; P(all O(k) are 0) &gt; eps which contradicts the fact that P(O(k)=0) goes to 0.",
