I haven’t read her novel, only read about it. And from my limited understanding, it can’t be any more sexually explicit than other popular novels high school students have access to.\n\nAs well, it’s dystopian story isn’t any worse than some of the classics students are required to read, such as the Animal Farm, Lord of the Flies, and Fahrenheit 451 (most of which were required readings for me in high school).\n\nIs there a valid reason for these decisions, or is this simply an overreaction by certain community groups…or maybe I’m totally missing something?\n\nI should probably point out that I live outside the US.",

Most of them seem to be in response to [this tweet](https://twitter.com/LasVegasDSA/status/1625216944243871745) from the Las Vegas DSA Chapter, with lots of replies implying that they \"took over\" the Democratic Party chapter in the state, and from there it is very unclear for me to understand what it was that actually happened in 2021 (at least it seems like it was 2021?). \n\nI'm familiar with how state chapters of the Democratic parties operate in general but not specifically with Nevada. I see some dunks about Nevada switching from caucusing to a traditional primary. But overall after 2020 I went from being very politically involved to tuning out because I became extremely embittered and needed to step away from paying attention to federal and national politics and starting focusing on local politics instead.",

What specifically is WRU doing? And why is this a new development?\n\nThanks!",
