Feingold states that Kavanaugh lied during his 2006 confirmation hearing to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. circuit. So my question is, can a judicial nominee be charged with perjury based on statements made during their confirmation hearing?",

        "text": "In May 2018, [Pew Research](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/05/21/u-s-voter-turnout-trails-most-developed-countries/) reported that the United States trails most developed countries in voter turnout. According to this report, \"the U.S. placed 26th out of 32\" OECD countries in terms of voter turnout. In an [April 2018 study](http://www.people-press.org/2018/04/26/3-elections-in-the-u-s-priorities-and-performance/), Pew also found that 90% of Americans believe both that high turnout in Presidential and in local elections is either \"very\" or \"somewhat\" important. A whopping 95% of voters also stated that it is important for voters to be knowledgeable. This raises the question of how to increase voter turnout and knowledge in the United States.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAutomatic voter registration and broader education seem to be effective tools of increasing voter turnout. [Research](https://www.thenation.com/article/how-oregon-increased-voter-turnout-more-than-any-other-state/) has shown that Oregon increased the size and diversity of its electorate by implementing automatic voter registration. The [United States Election Projec](http://www.electproject.org/home/voter-turnout/demographics)t shows that more educated voters turnout more than less educated voters, and in 2013 a [Pew Report](http://www.people-press.org/2013/02/05/what-the-public-knows-in-pictures-maps-graphs-and-symbols/) found that more educated voters are more knowledgeable about politics than less educated voters. However, some believe that cash rewards are the best way to increase voter turnout and knowledge. Many countries around the world have implemented compulsory voting, and [recent research found](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2016/01/08/compulsory-voting-results-in-more-evenly-distributed-political-knowledge/) that \"states using compulsory voting not only have higher turnout levels, but also more politically informed citizens.\" One economist has [even proposed](http://www.econlib.org/archives/2013/10/a_cheap_inoffen.html) a simple test of political knowledge with cash rewards based on the participants' grades.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat does experience and research tell us are the best ways to increase voter turnout and knowledge in a democratic system? How are or aren't those results applicable to the US? ",
