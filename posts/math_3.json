        "text": "I recently gave a talk on the Yang-Baxter equation. The focus of the talk was to state the connection between the Yang-Baxter equation and the braid relation. I thought it may be of interest to some people here and so I've written up part of my talk and put it on my blog: [http://mathstoshare.com/2023/03/12/braids-and-the-yang-baxter-equation/](http://mathstoshare.com/2023/03/12/braids-and-the-yang-baxter-equation/) \n\nThe main idea is that the variable in the Yang-Baxter equation is a function F that describes how the states of two particles change after interacting. If there are three or more particles, then we can interact pairs of particles in different ways. The Yang-Baxter equation states that certain chains of interactions are equivalent. These equivalences are given by braid relations such as the one drawn below:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/veykogw1scna1.png?width=1053&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=90864c3ecfbc49baa32ba9f4abfb5d48aba2c463\n\nThe Yang-Baxter equation is normally stated in terms of a matrix acting on a tensor product. In my talk, I found it helpful to start with the set-valued version and then move to the tensor product version after discussing the braid relations.\n\nQuestions about or feedback on my write up are very welcome!",

        "text": "Hi guys, for my number theory class, we’re all presenting a particular topic, and mine is p-adic numbers. I’m using Koblitz’s p-adic numbers, p-adic analysis, and zeta functions, and had a few questions I hope someone can answer!\n\nSo, I get the p-adic metric and norm, but what is a p-adic number itself, and how is it any different from the base-p representation of a number? Also, why do we use the “infinite string of numbers going to the left” at all, rather than just use the normal representation of a rational in base 10?\n\nIs there any clever ways to show p-adic numbers geometrically? For example, on a plane, etc.\n\nLastly, I have an idea for an analogy to use in my presentation. Suppose we are using the 2-adic metric on the integers. Now, imagine there is a tower, and at every floor, there are parties going on, getting better and better as you go up. At the ground floor, floor 0, all of the integers are invited. Here, the only condition for entry is divisibility by 1, or 2^0. Then, the even integers flock to the elevators, where they are taken up to the more intimate party on the 1st floor. Then, the “doubly-even” divisible-by-4 numbers head up once more to the second floor, and so on for all powers of 2. However, as far as a given integer goes, they never reach the top of the tower, where the owner, the number 0, resides, as it’s the only number divisible by every single power of 2. Then, the notion of size for a p-adic number can be associated by how close it is to the top, or 0, just the same as how the absolute value on the number line shows proximity to 0. Any thoughts on extending to rational numbers? Thanks!",

I've always been fascinated with mathematics and I've always wanted to see the limits of mathematics now and what people are doing to go beyond those limits. However, recently I've also started to become interested in *becoming* one of those people who are trying to go beyond the limits of maths. As a result, I've recently taken a very strong interest in research, especially in the fields of Lie Algebras and Lie Groups ~~despite only having a very elementary understanding of both~~ but I'd still be extremely excited to work in other fields.\n\nThe issue is that I have a pretty lackluster GPA my Freshman year of High School due to some factors that I don't want to talk about which makes it extremely difficult for me to find an affordable maths research program (all of the ones I've found that are affordable are extremely competitive and I wouldn't be able to make it in) which means that pretty much my last option is independent research or research with a professor.\n\nHow would I go about doing research with a professor? I know about the obvious like sending an email and getting a communications door open, but I'm more interested in what doing any amount of math research with a professor would look like at the high school level and, if it's even worth it.\n\nI know that I could always do independent research but I'ma be honest: the only question I'd be interested in independently researching is so undeveloped that I don't even know how I'd begin to ask it in a way where it's solvable.",

        "text": "Hey  guys! I would like to improve my logical and mathematical reasoning as a  whole. Before that, I'd like to say that I'm twenty-four years old and  have a very poor math background. I am now starting to understand how  difficult it is for me to solve simple problems due to my lack of  familiarity with mathematical thinking, I have difficulties even doing  very simple division math with natural numbers, so I want to solve that.\n\nAbout  a week ago I started learning mathematics from scratch, at the most  basic level possible, things like number line, how to count, what are  units, tens, numbers as forms of order, identification, measurement,  quantity... I'm learning everything from scratch, like I've never seen  it before.\n\nI believe that by  developing my cognitive areas linked to solving mathematical problems  and their complexities, I will have a little easier to understand the  modeling process, since this process is mostly a gradual logical process  of modulating geometric shapes to reach a result specific, obtaining at  the end of it all an artistic work. I believe that due to my lack of  familiarity with mathematics throughout my life, I now have serious  difficulties in understanding these processes.\n\nThe  reason why I want to improve my mathematical thinking and my problem  solving process is that I am very motivated to study and work in the  area of computer graphics (specifically 3d modeling) but I have been  having a lot of difficulties in basic math contents like measurement  conversion, for example.\n\nHaving  explained all this, I would like to know if it would be feasible, at the  same time that I study mathematics from scratch, to also study content  that involves the logical structure of problem solving, or should I  leave this a little further? Where could I find this content? Would it  be feasible to learn programming as a way to exercise logical reasoning?\n\nIt's  also important to point out that in the area of 3d modeling, obviously,  we see a lot of geometry content, so I want to put more emphasis on  that in the future. What do you think? Any feedback is valid and appreciated! Thanks for everyone's help!",

Then let A(G) be the average (that is arithmetic mean) of f(e) over all e. Notice that A(G)=0 if and only if every component of G is itself a regular graph. So, if we restrict to just connected graphs, then A(G) is in some sense a measurement of how badly G fails to be regular. \nIt is a nice exercise to see that two connected graphs G_1 and G_2 can have the same degree sequence and have different values of A(G).\n \nQuestion: Has A(G) been investigated before?

You have to memorize things eventually because the content becomes too time consuming to digest. And the idea of becoming a math teacher working my entire life in a shitty minimum wage job in a classroom full of sweaty children compared to working in tech from the comfort of my own home really dawns on me. But, honestly, I already committed to this major. I know I don't like the math parts of it, and I know I can't change schools because a lot of my general education credits as well as math credits will be lost. At this point, I just want to find a way to enjoy it. Does anyone know if it's possible? I feel like I'm learning how to slay dragons... in 2023.",

How many will I need to eat in order to stop eating them? In other words, at what point will my odds of completing the task approach 100%\n\n**Rules:** I have an endless supply, and they are random in their container. “Taste” is objective and unambiguous, and each pistachio can be rated on a 1 to 100 scale. I don’t need to eat the best *possible* pistachio, just one that tastes better than any I’ve eaten so far. \n\n(This is a problem I came up with while on shrooms. I can’t get it out of my head, but I’m not sure how to solve it. Any suggested edits or clarifications to make the problem cleaner/clearer would be greatly appreciated.)",

Why would the loan balance be higher when we assess the payments and fees realtime versus if we assess them at the end of the loan?

Of course, it does require an understanding of 4D space which is obviously a limiting factor and why it may not be mentioned often.",
