We can also ask questions about past habits by using the structure ***Did you use to.......?*** For example:  \n\n\n***Did you use to smoke when you were at college?***  \n\n\nMy question is: Is it grammatical to ask the same question with ***would*** ?  \n\n\n***Would you smoke when you were at college?***\n\nDoes it sound natural and grammatical?

I am not good at remembering the correct names for things (only after working on it recently have I managed to remember what a noun, adjective, etc are) and terms such as 'past perfect progressive' make me want to cry. (How am I ever going to remember that and why does it even have the word 'perfect' in it?)\n\nAnyway, I'd really appreciate recommendations for resources. I don't mind if it starts off at a very basic level, but would prefer material that is written for adults. I've tried:\n\nKhan Academy grammar course - way too patronising for an adult.  \n*Everyday English for grown-ups* by Michelle Finlay - I haven't read much of this but felt it didn't explain things very well. *The Penguin Guide to Punctuation*\n\nI have also tried a few online resources (can't remember names) but they were either aimed at very young children, or filled with poorly explained technical terms.\n\nThanks in advance for any help.\n\nP.S. To be clear, I feel I understand *basic* grammar but not the jargon.",

        "text": "\\*pardon me if I made any spelling or grammar mistakes in this thread as I'm still learning english\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nfistful, let's give you a background. I'm an Egyptian high school student and in this year (my third year) the past perfect tense is a subject of studying in my curriculum. now hold on a second. I know this subject might sound too easy that it's laughable for a linguistic teacher to even point it out, but you'd probably realise that these simple things are difficult for us non-English students. now we all know that, the past perfect tense is used to describe two actions that happened in the past for instance \"after he had eaten, he watched tv\", etc., so that the first action had to be in the past perfect form and that the second action is in the past simple form and we all know that it's not wrong to make both actions in the past simple form but the \\[past perfect, past simple\\] is a lot more accurate and preferable. ok. now the argument is that if in between these two actions in the past if there's no considerable period of time, what I mean is that if both of the actions are directly after one another, then it's more accurate and preferable to put both of them in a past simple form as if I would I say \"when I opened the window, the cat jumped out\" or \"when the lamp fell, the light went out\" rather then saying, \"when i had opened the window, the cat jumped out\" or \"when the lamp had fallen down, the light went out\", the light went off\". this has been really confusing for me and my classmates as we asked multiple teachers and some of them said that this argument is invalid and some others said that it is more grammatically correct to use the \\[past simple, past simple\\] if the two actions in the past has no time gap between them. I personally stick with the rule that says the first action always has to be in the past perfect but i'm not sure as i'm not a native-speaker. I hope I have provided you with the best information I could so that you could help me with this topic and if someone could answer this,please mention your linguitics degree, as i may need it to use as a proof that i got this info from a real linguistics pro and not some random guy from the internet, and thanks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Thoughts?? If I was wrong, then damn, I have become the very person that I did not wish to be.\n\n**ORIGINAL POST**\n\n&gt;That's still not actually grammatically correct, by the way. It should be something like 'This has not, and will never have, effected me'. You should always be able to remove a paranthetical clause or a set of brackets from a sentence and be able to read it normally. So, if you drop the clause currently it's 'this has not an effect on me', which doesn't make sense.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Sorry if I sound like a nazi, it's just a little thing I find interesting, really :P\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**MY RESPONSE**\n\nIt is not correct to use the word \"effected\" when you are describing an action that produces an effect on you. That would be \"affected\". Also, it is not correct to use the word \"will\", which indicates something happening in the future, with the auxiliary verb \"have\", while using the past tense word \"affected.\n\nIt would be more correct to say \"This does not, and will never have, an effect on me.\" Or you can use, \"This has not, and would never have, affected me.\"\n\nSorry if I sound like a nazi, it's just a little thing I find interesting, really :P\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit for format.",
