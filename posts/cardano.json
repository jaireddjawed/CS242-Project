It's highly likely your question is already answered here if you're new.\n\nWe expect you to be able to help yourself and others by referring to the information here and using the sub's search - please do not expect to be spoon fed basic information!\n\nThis post will help you understand:\n\n* **how to stay safe from scams**\n* how to use this subreddit and help yourself - which in turn with help keep the quality of posts to a high standard\n* understand the subreddit rules\n* learn where to buy ADA\n* learn how to store and stake your ada, which wallet to use etc\n* learn how to select a stake pool, understand fees and rewards\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Subreddit Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this post is to inform you about the Cardano project and tips on how to stay safe within the Cardano ecosystem. We want to make sure that every member of our community is up to date regarding Cardano news and updates and receive the best education about their online (crypto) security and safety. We hope that you find the following information useful to get you started and that everyone in our community enjoys their time here.\n\nPlease help us make the community a great place for discussion by always working to improve the discussion in some way, however small. Please read the [community code of conduct](https:\/\/www.cardano.org\/en\/community-code-of-conduct\/).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Searching the Sub for Answers\n\nBefore you make a post, be sure to get in the habit of searching previous posts first.\n\nTo search the subreddit, observe the reddit search bar at the top of the page:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The reddit search bar](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/sd2v74f6dxx61.jpg?width=985&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f78d0fbb18181b255fb62ada99eef3f504955bb4)\n\nEnter your search query, in this case 'staking'. Once you've made the search, you'll see the option to 'show results from r\/Cardano', make sure you click this button (outlined in red below):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Be sure to click the 'show results from r\\\/Cardano' button](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/v28c2f58dxx61.jpg?width=979&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=27418f75313fc7dc043b12ccebecb63113b2b272)\n\nOn mobile, searching the subreddit you're browsing should happen automatically!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Complementary Cardano Subs\n\nr\/Cardano is our main subreddit, but we also have several complementary and community run subreddits in order to help maintain flow of information and adhere to the subreddit rules (outlined later in this guide):\n\nr\/Cardano_ELI5 The 'explain like I'm five' subreddit is for newbie questions (how to buy, how staking works, fees etc). Posts explain in detain and in laymans terms the various Cardano and blockchain related topics. Please make sure you read the guidelines on this sub, as it has a very particular format.\n\nr\/CardanoDevelopers Everything Cardano developer related. If you're planning on building in the ecosystem, you'll want to join this sub.\n\nr\/CardanoStakePools Here you can also learn all about running a pool and get more insight into the pools in the ecosystem. Stakepool advertisement is not allowed on the main sub, so if your an stake pool operator, you'll want to market your pool on the stake pools subreddit.\n\nr\/CardanoTrading \\+ r\/CardanoMarkets We **only** allow market discussion in our [daily thread](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/cardano\/?f=flair_name%3A%22Daily%20Thread%22) on the main sub.

The key deposit is something you'll get back if you ever undelegate the wallet.\n\nStake Pool Fees\n\nPool fees are commonly misunderstood. Firstly let's clarify that pool fees are not a direct cost to you, the delegator! Fees are simply the pools share of rewards when they are distributed.\n\n**Fixed fee**\n\nThis is a set amount of ADA the pool earns (min. 340 ADA). *e.g If the fixed fee = 340 ADA: If a a pool earns 20000 ADA, the pool gets 340 ADA, and it's delegators get 19,600 ADA.*\n\n**Variable fee (aka pool margin)**\n\nThe variable fee is a percentage of rewards the pool earns. *e.g. If the variable fee = 1%: If a pool earns 20000 ADA, the pool gets 200 ADA, and it's delegators get 19,800 ADA.*\n\n*Note treasury tax not included in examples for simplicity.*\n\n**When making a delegation try to:**\n\n* Support pools that contribute to the community.\n* Use wallets that allow you to select your own pool (like [Daedalus](https:\/\/daedaluswallet.io\/) and [Yoroi](https:\/\/yoroi-wallet.com\/#\/)).\n* Avoid staking with [large entities](https:\/\/adapools.org\/groups) like Binance (It's bad for decentralisation and therefore the project).\n\n**Make sure you visit** [r\/CardanoStakePools](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CardanoStakePools\/)**!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Rewards\n\nComment command: `?rewards`\n\nThere are 3 incentive mechanisms that allow the community to earn rewards in ADA:\n\n**Staking Rewards**\n\nStaking is incentivised as it's important for network function as intended. See:\n\n* [What does it mean to \"stake\" your ADA?](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Cardano_ELI5\/comments\/kwmli8\/what_does_it_mean_to_stake_your_ada\/)\n* [Rewards FAQ](https:\/\/cardano-community.github.io\/support-faq\/#\/rewards)\n* [Staking Calculator](https:\/\/cardano.org\/calculator\/?calculator=delegator)\n* [Where do staking rewards come from?](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Cardano_ELI5\/comments\/l0190d\/where_do_staking_rewards_come_from\/)\n\nSimply delegate your ADA in a Shelley wallet and you'll earn a passive income!\n\n*Note that when you initially delegate, it'll take 15-20 days until you first receive rewards depending on your pool's performance, then every 5 days after (see rewards FAQ).*\n\nYour rewards depend on the balance during the epoch snapshot (as detailed in the FAQ). That means:\n\n* Rewards are compounded - rewards are added to your main balance and thus are captured in the next epoch snapshot which goes through the delegation cycle for increased rewards.\n* Any additional ADA you add to the wallet increases your rewards (again once the balance has been captured in a snapshot and has gone through the delegation cycle).\n\n**Community Advisor Rewards**\n\nIn [Project Catalyst](https:\/\/cardano.ideascale.com\/) you can earn rewards be writing thoughful reviews on proposal projects as a community advisor.\n\nSign up to the [ideascale platform](https:\/\/cardano.ideascale.com\/) and make sure to read the [community advistor guide](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1QkdaFK1tigrSI40iMeV3UP9GyTGsoqVmCUp7OJz0WFs\/edit).\n\n**Voting Rewards**\n\nVoting is another important part of being a community member, as and ADA holder you hold voting power.

It is important to note that this is not the fault of the blockchain itself, but of the team responsible for developing the hacked wallet. The security of your digital assets depends on choosing the right wallet and, most importantly, your behavior. Let's take a look at what Cardano as a network is responsible for in protecting digital assets, what wallet developers are responsible for, and what you can do.\n\n# TLDR\n\n* The Cardano network will not allow a third party to steal your property or restrict you from disposing of it.\n* Cardano separates user data (digital assets) from the provided services. The interface to the service (wallets) can be provided by any third party.\n* It is up to you to protect your digital assets through seed.\n* Cardano can never be hacked when it comes to protecting your assets and the right to dispose of them freely.\n\n# What's the difference between Cardano and Twitter?\n\nThe wallet is the interface to the blockchain. If you need to receive or send assets, you control the wallet in a similar way to, say, Twitter. Twitter is a social network. At its core, it's just a protocol that you access through a mobile app or web browser. That's the interface for you to Twitter. You can read other users' tweets and at any time you can write your own tweet for the whole world to see. Through the interface, you enter instructions that the protocol executes as you wish. There is a fundamental difference between Twitter and a blockchain wallet. Twitter is a centralized entity that is responsible for the protocol and infrastructure. The protocol is built on a client-server architecture. The company owns the servers that users connect to through an interface that is also supplied by Twitter. It can be said that Twitter has control over the protocol, the infrastructure, and also the interface. One implication is that you don't digitally own a Twitter account. You only have access to it through your login credentials. How is blockchain different? Let's explain it on Cardano.\n\nThis article was prepared by[ Cardanians](https:\/\/cardanians.io\/en) with support from[ Cexplorer](https:\/\/cexplorer.io\/).\n\n**Read the article**: https:\/\/cexplorer.io\/article\/how-does-cardano-protect-digital-assets","upvote_ratio":0.78,"created_utc":1678360450.0},{"title":"Cardano: Out of the Frying Pan","author":"ArmyofSpies","url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/m6YhwzQgIfE","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1678345406.0},{"title":"Bridging the Digital Divide!","author":"Karan_Desilva_WM","url":"\/r\/worldmobile\/comments\/11mp08o\/bridging_the_digital_divide\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1678358375.0},{"title":"Cardano Rumor Rundown March 9, 2023","author":"ArmyofSpies","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/cardano\/comments\/11mlilr\/cardano_rumor_rundown_march_9_2023\/","text":"Hey Everyone!\n\nLet\u2019s go\u2026.\n\nNewly Covered Today:\n\n1.

New ADA coins will gradually be released from the reserve and eventually, we will get to the point of having almost all coins in circulation. People believe that cryptocurrencies could serve as money that could hold value in the long term. Do you know how such an economy would work? Very differently than you know it today, and you might not like it. The price of goods could gradually decrease. Wages would gradually fall in nominal terms. It would be more difficult to repay debt. It might be impossible for governments to solve sudden serious problems economically. It is inconceivable for the present indebted governments to transform an inflationary economy into a deflationary one. Moreover, how can we create a new economy that is fair for all who want to join it? Algorithmic stablecoins may be the only possible way to create better money. ADA, like BTC and other similar coins, can be an amazing reserve currency, but it will probably never be a good medium of exchange.\n\n# TLDR\n\n* It was necessary to abandon the gold standard in order to stimulate the economy. \n* Are you ready to live debt-free? You may be, but governments are not. \n* It would be difficult for people to change their thinking if we switched to deflationary money. \n* Users can use DJED as a medium of exchange while holding ADA as a store of value. The Cardano ecosystem will provide both functions.\n* All assets in the world are volatile, including gold. There is no reason to think that ADA or BTC will be more stable than existing assets.\n* Cryptocurrencies can be a good store of value if we use their value for something useful. One of the most useful tools in the world is currency.\n\n# How would a currency with a fixed monetary policy work?\n\nDeflationary money refers to a monetary system where the value of money increases over time, leading to a decrease in the general price level. In other words, with deflationary money, the purchasing power of money increases over time. Each unit of currency can buy more goods and services than before. Cryptocurrency fans believe this is a desirable feature for a medium of exchange. Who wouldn't want to have more for not doing anything? Just keep the money and the individual would get rich. One of the current false narratives around cryptocurrencies is that such money is better than inflationary fiat currencies. However, one must see the difference between a medium of exchange and a store of value.

Therefore, new roles will be introduced: a constitutional committee and delegation representatives (DReps). Each ADA holder will be able to register themselves as a DRep. SPOs can become DReps if they register. Similar to how ADA holders delegate coins to pools, it will be possible to delegate decision-making power to DReps. Just as the number of blocks that a pool mint depends on the total stake, the amount of decision-making power will depend on the number of coins delegated to DReps. Why is the role of DReps important to Cardano?\n\n**TLDR**\n\n* Choosing a DRep will be a similar process to choosing a pool.\n* DReps should have good expert knowledge and moral credit to become a representative of ADA holders. \n* On-chain governance can be much more flexible in the exchange of DReps than is the case with the conventional government.\n* Decentralization is about the distribution of power, just like democracy. \n* Cardano should be first and foremost a community that uses and cares for the technology solutions and ecosystem.\n* The team within each blockchain project can be seen as a center of power. If this center of power is to be weakened, someone must take over its decision-making power.\n\n**Read the article**: https:\/\/cexplorer.io\/article\/delegation-representative-will-be-a-new-role-in-the-cardano-ecosystem","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1678098637.0},{"title":"Wrapped Bitcoin is finally available on the Cardano blockchain!

Last week, in addition to establishing an evergreen Project Catalyst Circle handle on Twitter [@ProjectCCvX](http:\/\/twitter.com\/projectCCvx), the Circle held an objective-setting workshop to form a set of directions that the reps propose to work on. The group also collaborated on a mission statement for Catalyst CircleV4:  \n\n\n*CC: Our mission \\[during our tenure\\]\u00a0is to create a centralized and standardized information management system and operational plan that is machine-readable and accessible through a one-stop-shop website that presents our organization's activities clearly and concisely*  \n\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/cww7dskyk5ma1.png?width=908&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3615e8428625b76142812e8d0df9744952f4e432\n\nOther key ideas that arose from the workshop included creating a set of Catalyst Circle deliverables and metrics that can be measured and quantified. Also for Circle reporting and outputs (such as meetings, transcripts, and other data) to be accessible and reusable by the community. Importantly the representatives see the need to develop a Catalyst Circle framework, giving structure to their roles and responsibilities that they can hand over to the next community-elected representatives later in 2023.  \n\n\nThe Catalyst Circle will next be working to refine and better define the Catalyst Circle code of conduct which sets out the expectations and topics for individuals coming together to play an important role as an advisory body to Catalyst.  \n\n\nMeanwhile - make sure to follow their Twitter account where you'll catch some of their messaging.

Meanwhile, here are some of the tweets I caught.

They loved exploring new things in their world, which was full of wonders and magic.\n\nOne day, they stumbled upon a treasure chest that was filled with sparkling cards. These cards were not ordinary cards, they were special, and each had a unique magical power. The cards were called NFTs or Non-Fungible Tokens.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/tiud65xl4dla1.png?width=1143&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f6cf6e033cc0ad674e831b386d91c399c099a847\n\nThe group of friends had never seen anything like it before. Charles, the leader of the group, knew that they had found something special. He explained to his friends that these cards were called NFTs and were very valuable.\n\nPi, the curious one, asked, \"Why are these cards so valuable? They look just like ordinary cards to me.\"\n\nCharles smiled and said, \"These cards are special because they are unique, and they cannot be duplicated. It's like having a one-of-a-kind treasure that no one else has.\"\n\nLukas, the tech-savvy one, suggested they find out more about NFTs and their magical powers. So, they all went on a quest to learn more about NFTs.\n\nOn their journey, they met a wise old wizard named Tommy. He told them that NFTs were created using a magical technology called Cardano. The technology was so advanced that it allowed people to create unique digital assets, like the NFTs they had found.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ev8k7wsn4dla1.png?width=966&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=01aa3803210eb0886887c9affb98cff50b166022\n\nDuncan, the brave one, asked, \"Can we create our own NFTs?\"\n\nTommy nodded and said, \"Yes, you can! With the power of Cardano, you can create your own unique NFTs and add your own magical powers to them.\"\n\nExcited by the possibility of creating their own NFTs, the group of friends decided to use their creativity to make their own special NFTs. Samuel, the artist of the group, created a beautiful NFT with his magical paintbrush. Charles used his leadership skills to make a rare NFT, and Lukas used his tech skills to create a unique NFT that no one had ever seen before.\n\nThe friends were amazed by what they had accomplished. They had created their own magical NFTs and had learned about the power of Cardano. They were grateful for their adventure and couldn't wait to see what other magical things they could create using their newfound knowledge.\n\nAnd from that day on, the group of friends continued to explore the wonders of their magical world and all the exciting things they could do with NFTs and Cardano technology.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ul05iuhu5dla1.png?width=892&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=89e8f3fa5978e3aa20ef80e253e8f2f78899db74","upvote_ratio":0.87,"created_utc":1677779704.0},{"title":"World Mobile Makes Headlines: Featured on Reuters for Its Innovative Approach to Bridging the Digital Divide.","author":"Karan_Desilva_WM","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=h5qdPz3foU4","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1677754383.0},{"title":"We're looking forward to the Voltaire Era, the 5th and final era on the Cardano roadmap!

Within 5 days, 1 million users had tried the app. In two months, it had more than 100 million users. That's a new world record for how quickly people adopted the service. 13 million people use the app every day. Converted to TPS, that would be 150. AI is used by about 50 times more people per day than Bitcoin. New startups are emerging literally every day and want to use AI for their business. It is almost certain that AI will change the world within the next decade. Wait, didn't they say the same thing about blockchain? Why is blockchain adoption so slow compared to ChatGPT? If you look into history, you will find that AI and blockchain have roots in the distant past. Cardano can be considered a publicly available solution, with decades of development behind each technology that is used. It's good to know that if a killer application emerges, the world can adopt it very quickly. Just as AI is celebrating mass success with ChatGPT, the blockchain industry is sure to succeed. We just need to keep on developing technology and finding applications. Come see what AI and blockchain have in common in terms of technology development and what that could mean for Cardano.\n\n# TLDR\n\n* People believe that the history of blockchain projects dates back to the time of their launch. These projects use technologies that are much older.\n* The AI industry had to go through an \"AI winter\" lasting more than a decade. The blockchain industry may experience a \u201ccrypto winter\u201d before it succeeds. \n* The evolution of the blockchain industry has certainly not stopped with the launch of Bitcoin. Smart contracts, tokenization, PoS, and decentralized governance are all things that came after Bitcoin.\n* We are waiting for ChatGPT of the blockchain industry.\n* Bitcoin is not the first attempt to create a cryptocurrency. It's hard to imagine it being the last possible attempt.\n* The idea of a decentralized global computer is sound and if Cardano fails people will make another attempt. But Cardano is still at the beginning, so it's a successful project so far.\n\n# The history of AI will help us understand the blockchain industry\n\nIt may surprise you to know that AI technology has its roots in the 1950s and it has been used in industry for decades. ChatGPT is only the first publicly available app that has succeeded en masse. Take a look at how AI has evolved and what the industry has had to go through to the present day where we can use it for our own purposes for free. The modern concept of AI emerged in the 1950s with the development of computers and the theory of computation. Mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing proposed the \"Turing Test\" in 1950, which became a fundamental concept in AI research.\n\nThis article was prepared by[ Cardanians](https:\/\/cardanians.io\/en) with support from[ Cexplorer](https:\/\/cexplorer.io\/).\n\n**Read the article**: https:\/\/cexplorer.io\/article\/how-to-perceive-the-success-of-chatgpt-in-the-context-of-cardano","upvote_ratio":0.66,"created_utc":1677764802.0},{"title":"Summon Platform: A Platform to Create & Manage Your Own Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)","author":"ATM-Stake-Pool","url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/fXE51dTq5AQ","text":"The emergence of Web3 technologies presents an opportunity to shift organisational structures towards more cooperative governance models.

We believe you have all heard of this phenomenon. Many central banks around the world are in the research phase, development phase, or have completed their first pilot programs. CBDCs are even already in use in three countries and their number will almost certainly grow in the coming years. Some experts warn that CBDC poses risks associated with loss of privacy, or it may even be a tool for governments to control residents. Why should people adopt CBDC in the first place? Wouldn't we be better off using stablecoins on Cardano? To know the answers, we need to look at why central banks are working on CBDCs. Let's compare CBDC with stablecoins on Cardano. Can these two technologies coexist?\n\n# TLDR\n\n* CBDCs can be tokenized similarly to USD-backed stablecoins.\n* It is not necessary to look at CBDC and blockchain as two competing solutions but as complementary networks.\n* The CBDC effectively suppresses the right to privacy as well as the right to possess value. Transactions through the Cardano ecosystem can be private and you can own the value.\n* Central banks can retain full control over monetary policy while giving people the freedom to choose what specific networks to use.\n* CBDC tokenization will allow the separation of the needs of central banks from the right to privacy and self-custody.\n* Central banks could mint at least part of the CBDC on SC platforms to make it easier for people to access.\n\nThis article was prepared by[ Cardanians](https:\/\/cardanians.io\/en) with support from[ Cexplorer](https:\/\/cexplorer.io\/).\n\n**Read the article**: https:\/\/cexplorer.io\/article\/cbdc-vs-stablecoins-on-cardano","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1677671094.0},{"title":"What is the djed token?

ADA is a scarce resource. For many, it is a store of value or the money of the future. The immutability of monetary policy is a fundamental principle for any blockchain. If it were to be violated, it would have fatal consequences on people's trust in the project. There is a direct link between scarcity and blockchain security. The market value of coins determines the quality of blockchain security. If security starts to decline, a change in monetary policy may be necessary as one possible solution. The choice between security or scarcity is a dilemma that would be very uncomfortable for the community. Is it possible to have a long-term economically sustainable blockchain without having to change scarcity? What mechanisms prevent a change in the monetary system and why is governance important? \n\n# TLDR\n\n* Monetary rules can exist forever, no matter what technology is used to enforce and maintain them. \n* In order of importance, rules come first, community second, and technology third.\n* Maintaining scarcity essentially means making a key decision in times of crisis and changing the protocol in time.\n* Scarcity can only be sustained economically in the long run through a sufficient security budget.\n* Those who are able to manage resources more efficiently have a better chance of survival.\n* The choice between scarcity and security is a choice that the community does not want to have, as they may not agree on a solution.\n* All ADA holders together are responsible for both security and scarcity.\n\n# How to maintain scarcity?\n\nChange is the only constant we can completely rely on in our universe. This is doubly true for technological progress. Blockchain protocols have the ambition to exist for several decades, perhaps forever. People are not interested in a particular protocol in terms of its design, implementation, or technological maturity, but mainly because of the financial and social opportunity it brings. They want monetary policy, decentralization and its associated features, protocol security, the ability to connect people without third parties, etc. to remain unchanged. Unfortunately, this cannot (very likely) be achieved without changing the protocols and their specific properties. Negative developments may force a change in rules that were intended to remain unchanged forever. To ensure the security of the protocol, it may be necessary to change monetary policy.\n\nThis article was prepared by[ Cardanians](https:\/\/cardanians.io\/en) with support from[ Cexplorer](https:\/\/cexplorer.io\/).\n\n**Read the article**: https:\/\/cexplorer.io\/article\/how-does-ada-scarcity-relate-to-cardano-security-and-governance","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1677591678.0},{"title":"Cardano's EMURGO has partnered with Goodwall to boost blockchain education for millions of youth in Africa and beyond!

Gensler released a video which very specifically described staking in terms of \u201cescrow\u201d or \u201cif you transfer your tokens to a staking-as-a-service provider\u201d.

Coinbase has released a comprehensive defense against their \u201cEarn\u201d staking program being classified as a security under the Howey Test and vowed to fight if the SEC goes after them.

The goal is\u00a0to develop the skills and the right frameworks to complete their projects and be successful in the ecosystem.  \n\n\nThis week, the funded projects had the first of these workshops, titled: **Business Models for Disruptive Emerging Tech Businesses** presented by Harry Hellyer from Edify Collabs. The session focused on finding the best ways to express the value created by your team, its products, and services \u2014 to yourselves, your customers, partners, and investors.  \n\n\nFundamentally, the funded projects present during the session went through an exercise to get under the hood of their value propositions and identify the value they bring and the ecosystems it is best suited for.  \n\n\nFor more on the session, check out the video recording here:\u00a0[https:\/\/bit.ly\/3XQ4IBm](https:\/\/bit.ly\/3XQ4IBm)  \n\n\nExpect more funded project workshops in the coming weeks as we aim to provide more education and resources for projects building in the Catalyst ecosystem throughout the rest of the year. These workshops are going to be made available soon via Catalyst YouTube Playlist as well.\n\n# Last week in CIPs \n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ckxpjcnb07ka1.png?width=1416&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c66e9cbee7366deef813e5fc4d9094f3acfabcfe\n\nHere's the recap from my colleague [Ryan Williams](https:\/\/twitter.com\/Ryun1_) that writes these fantastic CIP round-ups.\u00a0I figured you'd like them, too.

Is this really the case? Let's use this question to explain the basic principles of economic incentives and the rewarding mechanism in staking. This allows us to find out who is running what business and who the customer is. \n\n# TLDR\n\n* Delegating ADA coins is a similar mechanism to voting in a democratic election. \n* Stakers delegate coins to the pool and continue to have full control over the coins. \n* Cardano can be perceived as an employer paying for the services of its employees.\n* Both SPOs and stakers are running a business.\n* SPOs are active participants when it comes to the production of blocks, while stakers are passive ones.\n* Stakers are probably something like co-owners or shareholders of pools.\n* If a Lovelace is delegated to a pool, this means that the pool mints the block on behalf of the staker.\n\n# Who's the customer? \n\nCustomers usually buy something and get something in return. In order for customers to buy something, they need to choose a merchant to satisfy their demand. There is a business between the merchant and the customer. They both profit. The customer gets what they need and the merchant makes a margin on the sale. This is not the case with staking. Stakers do not buy a service from SPOs and do not pay them anything. They only voluntarily delegate ADA coins to pools, thus increasing the total stake of the pools. With delegated coins, pools can mint a larger number of blocks. For this, both SPOs and stakers will receive rewards from the Cardano protocol.\n\nThis article was prepared by[ Cardanians](https:\/\/cardanians.io\/en) with support from[ Cexplorer](https:\/\/cexplorer.io\/).\n\n**Read the article**: https:\/\/cexplorer.io\/article\/are-cardano-stakers-customers-of-staking-pools","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1677140981.0},{"title":"Cardano vs. NFT Danger","author":"ArmyofSpies","url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/bLMC2ZnhNeA","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.85,"created_utc":1677135823.0},{"title":"Unsure about the sidechains vs L2s after the CS debate?

They bear most of the risk associated with the loss of coins and let third parties profit. Yet the exchanges carry minimal risk and the CEO may decide to handle the coins differently than promised. With the advent of regulation, particularly in the US, Staking-as-a-Service (SaaS), provided by exchanges, is becoming more problematic. People should understand that ADA coins are the key to decentralizing Cardano. The project is deliberately designed so that people do not need unnecessary and unreliable intermediaries for financial transactions. It is not even necessary to rely on regulators and laws for staking. Staking is a financial operation. It should ideally be a Peer-to-Peer business between a staking pool operator (SPO) and a delegator. Believe that in the past CeFi services went bankrupt while DeFi and the protocols worked exactly as they had written in their source code. Let's take a look at the biggest differences between using a SaaS service and delegating ADA coins from your own wallet.\n\n# TLDR\n\n* The design of the protocol is deliberately devised to allow it to support its own needs as well as the needs of stakers and SPOs.\n* ADA holders that stake coins on centralized exchanges give up control not only of the coins but also of the Cardano network.\n* Regulators are tasked with protecting the assets of people who entrust them to a third party. ADA holders don't need third parties for staking.\n* ADA holders should realize that if there is any attack on Cardano through the exchanges, they will be the ones who lose their property.\n* The ADA holder decides what pool they delegate to, can vote in Catalyst, can participate in ISPO, can use DeFi, and can spend coins at any time.\n* Exchanges only ever do what is profitable for their own business and have no economic interest in supporting the Cardano ecosystem. ADA holders can support the ecosystem.\n\nThis article was prepared by[ Cardanians](https:\/\/cardanians.io\/en) with support from[ Cexplorer](https:\/\/cexplorer.io\/).\n\n**Read the article**: [https:\/\/cexplorer.io\/article\/staking-on-cardano-doesn-t-need-third-parties](https:\/\/cexplorer.io\/article\/staking-on-cardano-doesn-t-need-third-parties)","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1677067370.0},{"title":"The Coti Treasury has reached another major milestone!

Whatever your opinion on this functionality, the important thing is that it is openly debated by such a large number of people. The debate has its problems and the arguments are not always based on facts. Many opinions are driven by fear or lack of technical knowledge about how blockchain works. You can't say that anyone is moderating the debate, although Charles Hoskinson is setting the main tone. The community is divided. One part defends CS, and the other sees it as a road to hell. At the moment, there is not even a CIP on CS and yet the debate is happening, which we consider a great success. It reminds me of the times when the Bitcoin community was debating block size, or the OP\\_Return wars were going on. We believe that the future of the Cardano project will depend mainly on the quality of decentralized governance. Let's take a step back and think about what decentralization is really about. \n\n# TLDR\n\n* People mistakenly consider the immutability of protocol rules to be the point of decentralization. \n* A decentralized system must be capable of change through democratic voting.\n* The ability to vote in a decentralized way is perhaps more important than network consensus.\n* What should be immutable is the mission of the project. Specific protocol rules can be modified if it helps achieve the mission.\n* Conflict of views is a perfectly natural manifestation in a democratic society. Why should it be different in the context of blockchain?\n* More important than the specific principles of blockchain technology is trust in the system. \n* Voting is a way to keep the community together and overcome disputes. \n\n# Ability to evolve\n\nPeople sometimes think that all the rules about how a distributed network works can be put into the source code. They then consider these rules to be immutable, i.e. forever given or binding. People tend to protect these rules and insist on their immutability. They believe that this will ensure the long-term existence of the project. They see this as the point of decentralization. It is a perfectly logical attitude. But I'm afraid it doesn't necessarily work well in a dynamic world that is full of change. In nature, the individuals that survive longest are those that can adapt to new conditions as quickly and efficiently as possible.

These people are trying to defend the basic principles of public blockchain networks, of which Cardano is clearly one. Opponents believe that KYC required by some SPOs will lead to some principles being violated and Cardano could gradually become a centralized network. The heated debate about Contingent Staking is not so much about the technology as it is about the philosophy of the project and Satoshi's legacy. If you think about the very basic principles of blockchain technology, you will find that CS does not fundamentally violate any of them. I'll try to convince you of that.\n\n# TLDR\n\n* Contingent Staking mostly interferes with the definition of permissionless, as SPOs requesting delegator\u2019s data become gatekeepers.\n* No one can centrally dictate to SPOs how to manage their policies related to delegations. Cardano remains permissionless.\n* The delegators\u2019 market demand for non-KYC pools will be stronger than the powers of the authority. The market will influence what kind of pools will emerge.\n* Authorities cannot gain control of Cardano through SPOs as control is held by ADA holders.\n* Preventing the introduction of a new feature on the basis of ideology or philosophy may lead to a violation of the principle of openness.\n* Contingent Staking is designed to be completely trustless.\n* We need to be smart in our fight against the current financial world.

In this article we are going to see how we approached this specific task, and what lays ahead.\n\n## The Context\n\nIt is all but obvious how to evaluate an NFT. In fact, there are thousands of collections, each with its specific traits. Some trait combinations are rarer than others and, usually, rarer assets are characterized by higher prices; however, there is no unique way of computing rarity, as it is reflected by the fact that there are at least two well-known ways of doing it, called \u201crarity\u201d and \u201cstatistical rarity\u201d.  \n\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/zw1t3kq2j7ja1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=015455acd402b012b960295bf5f0d675596fbfea\n\nA trial in this direction was performed by the \u201cfloor price\u201d computation, which can provide you with a lower bound of the asset value, but how high should you go with respect to that bound when you decide to list your asset? This assumed that you should do it in first place because, maybe, your asset is way more common than all the others listed, so you may define the new floor yourself. In this case the question should be: how low should you go with respect to the floor? There is no objective answer to these questions, and this is under the hypothesis that a floor value exists. In fact, what if your asset has some trait that is so rare that 0 assets, among those listed, display it? Which floor should you choose? These are all open questions, and the only way for answering them so far has been to use personal experience. Personal experience, however, has three limitations: first, it takes a lot of time and effort to be built; second, it is affected by personal biases; third, while building it, you may end up doing mistakes, which could cost you a lot. This is why we decided to throw Machine Learning (ML) into the equation.\n\nML is a branch of computer science in which softwares are instructed with examples, rather than rules. This is the same that happens to the human brain: we do not learn to drive or swim just by reading a handbook; we need practice. This is why it is called \u201cMachine Learning\u201d. ML, however, is not the magic wand that you can shake around and make things happen. ML needs data, and data need to be clean, understandable, and meaningful. Just like you would not teach your child History by randomly jumping between epochs and continents, you cannot just give raw data to an ML model and pretend that it learns. There\u2019s no way around hard work. So how do you teach it?  \n\n\n[Listings and Sales spread example](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/8hc1kuw3j7ja1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=27ae8aac6cc024e10d2cf4295153f873145464c3)\n\nThe closest scenario to NFT evaluation is real estate evaluation. Real estates and NFTs have many things in common. For starting, they both are illiquid assets. Houses are characterized by traits as well (surface, year of construction, energy rating, number of rooms\u2026), and, like NFTs, not all trait combinations are available. Some real estates can be staked (rented). Plus, they are (in most cases) clustered in collections (cities), within which the evaluations share a set of rules.\n\nHouse pricing evaluation, however, is a trivial problem. In fact:  \n1. real estates distribution is a function of two clear parameters, latitude and longitude;  \n2. real estates are priced by agencies, which have well defined criteria to perform the evaluation, which results in a small scatter of the data;  \n3. the said criteria are the result of a general consensus and are human-understandable.\n\nWhen an agency has to evaluate the price of a real estate, they first check the unit prices of the houses in the same area. Second, they average them in order to have a robust estimation. Finally, they correct the price of the house they are evaluating for its specificities (quiet location +10%, not very bright -10%, surrounded by nature +20%\u2026).\n\nThe same cannot be done for NFTs. In fact:  \n1. they have no obvious metric that one should use to compute their distance;  \n2. there is no agency rating NFTs according to well-defined criteria, so the scatter between assets sharing common traits can be \\*huge\\*;  \n3. in most cases, it is not understandable why some trait should be more appealing than others (set aside for their rarity).\n\nSo how can the problem be tackled?\n\n## Our Approach\n\nHaving chosen to use the power of ML to help us solve this challenge, the first step was to decide how to deal with overfitting. What is it? In short, if we assume that the information provided by our data points is made of two components:\n\n1. signal, which is what we want to fit;  \n2. noise, which is the product of random processes;\n\nOverfitting means to fit the noise alongside with the signal. This, of course, is a bad idea because it would teach the model something wrong, which can lead to catastrophic failures. from Wikipedia\u2019s page about [\\[overfitting\\]](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Overfitting), shows the phenomenon very well. The black line is the right fit, the blue line is the overfitted one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Overfitting Illustration](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/d2s6vxh5j7ja1.png?width=377&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8886124882c83920f570567b5d5e0454b51a4a59)\n\nMost ML models tend to overfit, and this is particularly true for Neural Networks. In our case, overfitting would have led the model to provide excellent or nearly perfect evaluations for the listed assets, and to spectacularly fail for those not for sale. In order to avoid this, we decided to take a gradual approach. We started with a simple model, and we evaluated its performances, favoring quality over quantity (namely, better to reproduce well just a handful of collections than to reproduce well a few of them and badly many others); then we started a loop in which we identify what is not working properly, we increase the model complexity in order to overcome the limitations, and we evaluate the improvements.\n\nOur goal is to repeat this procedure as many times as it is required to converge to a model capable of being as universal as it could aim at being. In practice, we chose the \u201cslow and steady\u201d philosophy, instead of \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d, and we are developing the model in such a way that every new release is a superset of the previous one. Namely, if something works well, it will keep on working well or will work even better; and if something does not work, it may start to work.\n\nThe second challenge we had to face was to provide the user with the confidence intervals that he\/she could use to evaluate the work of the model. Avoiding to add the error bars\/confidence intervals is probably the most common mistake in ML. In fact, all ML is built atop the assumption that the goal should be to create the model that maximizes some score which expresses the quality of the inference. Of course, maximizing the score is important, but having a model that returns a number and being unable to quantity the uncertainty associated to it can be dangerous in many situations. Imagine that you have to undergo a heart transplantation and there is an ML model that predicts that you have 99% chance to survive the operation. 99% is a pretty high number, but what if there is an error bar of +0.9\/-90%? If your true value can fall anywhere between 10% and 99.9%, then that 99% value does not look so promising anymore because the final outcome is, basically, the flip of a coin. Same if you are find that an asset is undervalued by 90%, but the inference model unreliable. This is why we have created the five classes:  \n\u2014 underpriced;  \n\u2014 cheap;  \n\u2014 fair;  \n\u2014 expensive;  \n\u2014 overpriced;  \n\n\n[Example of valuation classes display on cnftjungle.io](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/vdguvcc7j7ja1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8adef2232ee98e7728e54ee0a856ea0bb0642331)\n\nand this is why we have also enriched the inference with two further values:  \n\u2014 goodness of fit;  \n\u2014 tightness of fit.\n\nThe goodness of fit tells you how well the model performed with respect to the global point distribution. If the goodness of fit is rated \u201cexcellent\u201d, it means that both globally and locally the model works well at reproducing what it sees; if is below excellent, local deviations are possible, so the estimations should be taken with two pinches of salt (the first because the predictions are not financial advices, and the second because the model cannot fully adapt to what it sees).\n\nThe tightness of fit, instead, tells you how scattered data points are with respect to the best fit. Data points can be highly scattered, and yet the fit can be excellent, this is absolutely possible; it is the opposite that is not valid. Namely, the tightness of fit will always be compatible or worse than the goodness of fit. The tightness of fit can tell you how relevant local deviations are, when the fit is sub-excellent, and, when the fit is excellent, how wide the margin of opportunity could be.\n\nFinally, the last challenge to address is market manipulation. How to avoid it? Stated that there is no such a thing as a fool-proof algorithm, we have been well aware of this issue since the beginning of our work and we have taken precautions, just like we have done for the rest. No further detail will be shared about this, in order not to help malicious entities crack the algorithm. What we can say is that further steps will be taken in the future, to make this chance less and less likely as the service increases its popularity.\n\n## Future Prospects\n\nThis all brings us to the most exciting part: what lays ahead?\n\nHaving a reliable model for NFT price determination offers a wide range of opportunities of which nobody probably has ever taken advantage of. We have started with the sniping function that allows you to find the most undervalued asset within some specific collection, but this is merely scratching the surface. In fact, so far we have compute the undervaluation as the ratio between the listing price and the estimated fair value (relative undervaluation), but a valid alternative could be to use the difference between the two of them (absolute undervaluation).\n\nMoving on, more complex queries could be possible. In fact, the search could be enriched by adding more and more criteria, like conditions on the traits, rarity rankings, price or profit boundaries. For example, a search could look like: \u201cfind the 10 most undervalued assets with a potential profit of 200+ ADA between the collections A, B, and C. For collection A, consider only those assets with trait \\*x\\* having one of the following values: x1, x3, x4. For collection B exclude the asset number 12. For collection C consider only the assets with a rarity rank below 1,000\u201d. This would be a paradigm shift in the sniping experience. But things could be moved even further.\n\nImagine to have 10,000 ADA that you want to invest in NFTs. Despite the possibility of creating queries like the one described above, it would take a lot of time to allocate the funds between 50, 100 or 200 different assets. If only there was a better way\u2026 Well, there is. The optimal capital allocation could be vastly automated with the help of optimization algorithms. You could pass the interface further constraints, like \u201cI want my capital be divided between at most 100 assets from at least 5 collections\u201d, \u201cI do not want more than 30 assets per collection\u201d, and \u201cthe cheapest asset must be worth at least 30 ADA\u201d. The algorithm would run and you would get the best capital allocation strategy that it found according to your criteria. At this point you would be able to interact with these data and choose, for example, which assets to keep and which to discard, then you could add further constraints, or you could modify the existing ones, and move to the next iteration. This way, what would be a very complex and time-consuming procedure could be reduced to a series of clicks.\n\nAnd now the icing on the cake. What we have seen so far allows you to scout for the best opportunities offered by the market right now, but it does not help you to determine whether investing in a particular collection may or not may be profitable with the perspective of N months in the future. In fact, the price distribution is constantly changing, and assets can change category more quickly than many could sell them (this is especially true for the most expensive ones). In order to mitigate this risk, we are also planning to trace the fair value changes with time for feeding them to forecasting models. This could (here the conditional is imperative) allow us to quantify the probability that a specific collection will appreciate in time, therefore adding a further layer of confidence to the sniping experience.\n\nThere would be so much more to say about our future plans, but here we stop: we do not want to give you too many spoilers. Please, note that this section does not constitute a roadmap: things may be implemented in a different order than the one hinted here, or may not be implemented at all (either due to contingent factors or to technical difficulties). However, we are boiling with ideas and, if you liked what we have done so far, you will love what lays ahead. Finally, none of this is a financial advice. We do not endorse investing in any particular collection, or asset. We encourage you to think with your own head, do your own research, and take full responsibility of your choices.

Full meeting minutes will be published after the event for further community engagement and feedback.

The major side effect later this year is expected to be around the ability of\u00a0the community to come along and start co-creating\/helping build\/suggest improvements to these foundations.  \n\n\nThis repo is the starting point and we're seeking improvements to it throughout the months to come.

These workshops aim\u00a0to provide educational resources tailored to some of the pain points faced by very early-stage blockchain startups and projects building within the Cardano ecosystem.  \n\n\nThe first of these will happen on the 21st of February, this event is open to all Catalyst-funded projects. The workshops will take place on the bi-weekly Coordinator call at 5 PM\u00a0UTC.

SPOs would be able to request information from potential delegators and decide whether to accept or reject the delegation based on provided data. This functionality is misinterpreted as introducing a KYC process at the first layer. This is a misconception as it is only an extension of the existing process and SPOs will not be forced to use it. Contingent Staking can be a win for Cardano as it will extend its functionality with a capability that can bring greater adoption, liquidity, and usage. All of Cardano's key characteristics such as decentralization, censorship resistance, openness, and accessibility to everyone on the planet without third-party consent will be preserved.\n\n# TLDR\n\n* ADA holders will probably not delegate to pools requiring KYC. They have to arrange delegations differently. \n* Fiat money and the internet serve both good and bad people. Cardano should be the same. \n* More versatility will bring more ways to use Cardano.\n* Cardano is not a tool of one group to fight fiat currencies or states.\n* Contingent Staking does not disrupt the key characteristics of Cardano.\n* If there is a demand to delegate coins to a pool that does not require KYC, such pools will arise.\n* ADA holders will decide on the implementation of Contingent Staking through a vote.\n\n# Contingent Staking\n\nContingent Staking is intended to extend the delegation certificate to allow the insertion of extra information. This can be contact details, KYC information, or whatever. If the SPO takes advantage of this option, the delegation will go through the multi-signature process. Both delegators and SPOs must sign the transaction for the delegation of coins to the pool to occur. SPOs can define their terms of use. There may be a cooperation contract between the SPO and the delegator.\n\nThis article was prepared by[ Cardanians](https:\/\/cardanians.io\/en) with support from[ Cexplorer](https:\/\/cexplorer.io\/).\n\n**Read the article**: https:\/\/cexplorer.io\/article\/contingent-staking-is-a-beneficial-extension-for-cardano","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1676627354.0},{"title":"Another great video by \u0398eodore \u20b3\u03a3 |Testnet Diary part 2- World Mobile Testnet Insights with Alex & Paddy.","author":"Karan_Desilva_WM","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fALuVqVSw2Y","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1676658057.0},{"title":"Cardano Catchup - Successful Hardfork, Defi Updates, World Mobile + more..","author":"TWPaul","url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/uXApLXoD3eY","text":"","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1676645662.0},{"title":"Building your online business powered by Cardano [github.com\/MeshJS\/ecommerce-next-ts-template]","author":"ErmJustSaying","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/cgakogvivpia1.jpg","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1676625916.0},{"title":"Advice needed.

While some skeptics have questioned the longevity of NFTs, there are several reasons to believe that they are here to stay.\n\nOne **key advantage of NFTs is their potential for use in a wide range of industries beyond art and music. NFTs can be used to represent unique identities, such as in the realm of gaming or virtual reality, where users can create and trade one-of-a-kind digital assets, like skins or avatars. In the sports industry**, NFTs have been used to authenticate athlete memorabilia, and there is potential for them to be used to authenticate game tickets or stadium access.\n\nIn the realm of collectibles, **NFTs are creating a new era of valuable and unique items. The popularity of traditional collectibles such as baseball cards or stamps has demonstrated the human desire to collect and own unique items. NFTs are taking this a step further by offering a digital representation of collectibles**, making them accessible to a wider audience and enabling easier tracking and trading. Many **NFTs are not just collectibles, but also open the door to utility** or unlock the ownership of digital lands, creating new opportunities for the virtual world.Are you new to this? Check out our [NFT marketplace](https:\/\/jamonbread.io\/) and start collecting what you like right now.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/dyxp6ojb8cia1.png?width=1630&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=df386b334c15884fe7f720c88c0bea9d5eb4797c\n\nAnother advantage of NFTs is their **potential for creating new revenue streams for content creators. In the art world, NFTs have allowed artists to monetize digital works that would otherwise be difficult to sell, and to earn royalties every time their works are resold**. In music, NFTs could be used to represent ownership of exclusive or limited-edition albums, providing a new way for artists to generate revenue while also fostering a stronger connection with their fanbase.\n\nNFTs also have the potential to streamline the process of buying and selling assets. For example, **NFTs can be used to represent real estate properties, making it easier to transfer ownership, verify ownership rights, and track the history** of the property. Similarly, NFTs can be used to represent luxury goods, like high-end watches or designer bags, to **track authenticity and ownership history.**\n\nLooking to the future, there are several exciting potential applications for NFTs. For example, **NFTs could be used to represent carbon credits or other environmental assets, creating a more efficient market for reducing carbon emissions**. Similarly, NFTs could be used to **represent intellectual property rights, such as patents or trademarks, making it easier for creators to protect their ideas and monetize their inventions.**\n\nIn conclusion, **NFTs are not a passing fad, but rather a technology with significant potential to transform the way we think about ownership, value, and verification of unique assets.** As new use cases emerge, we can expect to see NFTs become an increasingly common part of our digital landscape. Ultimately, **NFTs have the potential to unlock new forms of value and ownership**, and the future of the technology is exciting to contemplate.  \n\n\nWhat do you think are the most promising possibilities for using NFTs in the future?","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1676460694.0},{"title":"What are the advantages to have a stake above or below 50k ADA as pledge?","author":"SupljaKanta","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/cardano\/comments\/112ww1z\/what_are_the_advantages_to_have_a_stake_above_or\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1676464143.0},{"title":"Cardano Staking Impacts from SEC and Kraken + Contingent Staking","author":"TWPaul","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8c9H-Q8Pkso","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.78,"created_utc":1676472073.0},{"title":"We debunk rumors surrounding U.S. crypto regulation and summarize Charles Hoskinson's latest video on contingent staking.

TPS can tell us how many people are using or can use the network at any given time. The TPS metric assumes that one transaction transfers value between one sender and one receiver. However, it has one catch. This assumption is not valid for the blockchain industry. Cardano and many other networks can send multiple assets to multiple receivers in a single transaction. Such transactions are commonly seen in DEXs, for example. Centralized exchanges can submit a single transaction for all withdrawals at a given time. Let's explain why the TPS metric should be used very carefully and should rather be replaced in the case of blockchain networks.\n\n# TLDR\n\n* Transactions consisting of many financial operations are cheaper and smaller in size.\n* The TPS metric is unable to provide data on the number of recipients who received funds through the transaction. \n* It would be better to measure something like the number of recipient addresses per second.\n* In the future, it will be more efficient for blockchain networks to transmit large transactions with multiple operations than single transactions.\n\nThis article was prepared by[ Cardanians](https:\/\/cardanians.io\/en) with support from[ Cexplorer](https:\/\/cexplorer.io\/).\n\n**Read the article**: https:\/\/cexplorer.io\/article\/cardano-makes-tps-metric-obsolete","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1676363720.0},{"title":"Dear Project Catalyst community \ud83d\ude4f Now we've completed our proposal, please see the Catalyst closeout\/how-to video below; it shows how to use NuFi wallet with decentralized bridges to migrate assets from Ethereum to Cardano + manage Cardano, Ethereum and Milkomeda C1 accounts\/NFTs\/Dapps together \ud83d\udcaa","author":"nufiofficial","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/NuFi_Official\/status\/1622962080646156288","text":"","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1676396575.0},{"title":"Contingent staking as a solution to a possible delegator-draining attack on SPOs.","author":"skr_replicator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/cardano\/comments\/112bsvo\/contingent_staking_as_a_solution_to_a_possible\/","text":" The attack:\n\n1. Attackers need optimally the saturation level amount of ADA. (could s\\*ll it back after the attack is done)\n2. The attacker picks a public SPO to attack.\n3. Sorts the delegators by ADA, and picks the smallest one.\n4. The attacker constructs a franken-address with their own spending key, and the small delegator's stake key.\n5. Attacker send that huge amount of ADA to that franken-address, putting the SPO way above saturation.\n6. Other hard-earned delegators start leaving.\n7. If the victim delegator leaves, the attacker could just repeat from 3) to resend the ADA to another smallest one who is still there.\n8. When no more delegators are leaving, the attacker can withdraw the ADA and pick another SPO to repeat the whole attack from 2). The attack cripples the SPO and only costs the attacker a little bit of fees, and possibly a couple rewards if the attack has to last multiple epochs.\n\nSo, could this kind of attack be solved with the contingent staking that Charles is talking about lately? Or is this attack too powerful even for that? Since the attacker would never delegate their own stakekey\/identity to the SPO, only pretending to be another address of his victim.\n\nOne solution I could think of is requiring disclosure of the delegator's public keys as a contingent staking requirement, and only account for addresses that can be obtained from that public key. So then any frankenaddresses could not be added to the active stake. This might add some computational complexity summing up the active stake though.","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1676397792.0},{"title":"Cardano: what it is and how does it work?

If you're a Cardano (ADA) holder, **you should definitely consider getting a hardware wallet to store your assets.** In this article, we'll explain how hardware wallets work and why they are a must-have for anyone looking to protect their crypto investments.  \n\n\n**How hardware wallets work:**  \nA hardware wallet is a **device that is designed specifically to store cryptocurrencies. These devices look like USB sticks and connect to your computer or smartphone via USB.** When you first set up your hardware wallet, you will be asked to create a unique passphrase that is used to encrypt your private keys. Your **private keys are stored on the device**, so only you have access to them.\n\nWhen you want to make a transaction, you simply **connect your hardware wallet to your computer or smartphone, enter your passphrase, and sign the transaction with your private key.** The transaction is then broadcast to the blockchain network, where it is processed and confirmed.\n\nThe key advantage of a hardware wallet is that your **private keys are stored offline, which makes them much less vulnerable to hacking and theft. Since the device is not connected to the internet, there is no way for hackers to access your private keys. This makes hardware wallets the safest way to store your cryptocurrency assets.**Two of the most favorite hardware wallets are [Ledger](https:\/\/www.ledger.com\/) and [Trezor](https:\/\/trezor.io\/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Most popular hardware wallets](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/tyi7ncqb4zha1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=57156a8fe4fabbd69ebb2067b549d31eb010eb14)\n\n**Why You Should Have a Hardware Wallet for Cardano assets:**  \nIf you're holding ADA or any other assets on Cardano, it's important to keep it safe and secure. As the platform continues to grow and evolve, it's likely that the value of those assets will increase. That's why it's important to store them in a secure and safe place.   \nA hardware wallet is the best way to store your Cardano assets because it offers the highest level of security. With a hardware wallet, you can rest assured that your assets are protected from hacking and theft. Additionally, hardware wallets are easy to use and can be taken with you wherever you go, so you can access your assets whenever you need them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Cardano NFT Assets](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/e2glmxda4zha1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5fd0dd41e35b33224354b34ec5ed71b132b570bc)\n\n**As a Cardano (ADA) holder we recommend following this wallet strategy:**\n\n1. **Hardware Wallet:** Store your **long-term investments (NFTs, tokens or just your saved ADA) in a hardware wallet that is kept offline** and disconnected from any decentralized applications (dApps) to provide the highest level of security.\n2. **Market Wallet:** Use a market wallet for your **daily trading NFT or token activities. This wallet allows you to easily move your assets from your hardware storage wallet to this one as needed**, giving you the flexibility to trade when and how you want. Have this wallet connected with just the dApps you are using often.\n3. **Mint Wallet:** Load a mint wallet specifically with ADA for minting purposes. This wallet enables you to transfer your assets to other wallets as needed, making it **convenient for your minting activities.**\n\nWith a user-friendly interface such as the Eternl wallet (or others), you can easily **manage all three wallets from one place**, using separate seed phrases for each \u2013 **YES, you can connect Ledger and Trezor (the most common hardware devices) and manage it with the wallet you are used to.** This way, you can keep your Cardano (ADA) assets safe, secure, and accessible, while still enjoying the convenience of having all your wallets in one place.\n\nIn conclusion, hardware wallets **are a must-have for anyone who is serious about protecting their cryptocurrency investments.** They are the safest way to store your assets and offer peace of mind knowing that your assets are protected from hacking and theft. **If you're a Cardano (ADA) or any other cryptocurrency, we highly recommend that you get a hardware wallet to store your assets.** With a hardware wallet, you can keep your assets secure and easily access them whenever you need them.","upvote_ratio":0.82,"created_utc":1676301810.0},{"title":"Do you know much about Liqwid?","author":"DecentralizedNation","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/cardano\/comments\/111hw7k\/do_you_know_much_about_liqwid\/","text":"It is a borrowing and lending protocol in Cardano, for which the Cardano Community had great expectations. \n\nAlthough I had heard about the project, I never researched deeper into it, until this moment. \n\nI\u2019ve created a in-depth analysis going through the project, from the tech, to the team, to the tokenomics, and if that is something that can be useful to you check it out here: [https:\/\/youtu.be\/9XESHjEqJIw](https:\/\/youtu.be\/9XESHjEqJIw)","upvote_ratio":0.82,"created_utc":1676317164.0},{"title":"How the Hydra Head protocol will work","author":"Cardanians","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/cardano\/comments\/1112riy\/how_the_hydra_head_protocol_will_work\/","text":"The Cardano network allows you to submit a transaction for which you pay an average of 0.17 ADA.

When Shelley first booted up the rate was around 5%. It is now closer to the 3-4 range. There are several bonds available on Optim right now that are offering greater than 5% APY by contributing to the bond. Best part is it's all done via smart contract. So you deposit the ADA and lend your staking rights, but at the end of the term (currently all bonds are for 1 year term) you get all the ADA back plus the APY earned. When the bond is fully funded, it's utilized by the borrower as pledge to help bootstrap their staking pool. Plus you get a future airdrop of some OPT tokens. Win-win for everybody.\n\nJust wanted to drop this out there for people to see. Great incentives to participate in that protocol. [check it out](https:\/\/app.optim.finance\/dashboard)\n\nEDIT:\nas requested, here are some of the risks:\n\n* borrower does not pay interest on the full term of the bond, so APY may not be as high as expected if that happens\n* smart contract could get hacked. That has yet to happen on Cardano but that does not mean it can not. We've already seen two major vulnerabilities be patched before being exploited (MinSwap and Liqwid)\n* Importantly, the borrower never takes control of the ADA itself, just the staking rights for that ADA.

Kraken has announced that it has discontinued its SaaS service. Gary Gensler in a short video published by the SEC explained that they don't object to staking mechanisms, but staking providers. This only has a positive effect on the blockchain industry, as the SEC is essentially encouraging self-custody and making it impossible for centralized exchanges to use staking for their business. Let's not rejoice prematurely, the SEC is unpredictable and may come out with some other announcement. Whatever the next announcement, trust that no authority with limited jurisdiction can stop a decentralized network like Cardano.\n\n# TLDR\n\n* The SEC requires staking providers to provide users with proper disclosures and safeguards required by US laws.\n* The SEC has no objection to PoS networks and the staking mechanism.\n* People using their own wallets for staking are not the target of the SEC.\n* Cardano has liquid staking and there is no required minimum of coins so stakers don't need SaaS services.\n* The momentum that drives stakers out of centralized exchanges is actually a small win.\n* ADA coins can be easily hidden and easily moved to the other side of the planet.\n\n# SEC focuses on staking providers\n\nCentralized exchanges provide a SaaS service. They are therefore staking providers. There are costs associated with providing a staking service, so exchanges take a fee. If you own coins of PoS projects such as ADA, ETH, DOT, ALGO, etc, you can stake them either from your own wallet or through staking providers. If you use a third party, i.e. a centralized exchange, for example, you make this decision based on the promised reward. The third-party should deliver on the commitments. However, this can be relatively difficult in some cases. They should use coins for staking. If they don't do something right, they could lose the coins. Ethereum uses slashing, so this risk is real.\n\nThis article was prepared by[ Cardanians](https:\/\/cardanians.io\/en) with support from[ Cexplorer](https:\/\/cexplorer.io\/).\n\n**Read the article**: https:\/\/cexplorer.io\/article\/sec-can-t-stop-cardano","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1676020915.0},{"title":"Everything you want to know about the Cardano Sidechain Toolkit","author":"Crypto_Simp","url":"https:\/\/adapulse.io\/everything-you-want-to-know-about-the-cardano-sidechain-toolkit\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1676046629.0},{"title":"Catalyst Weekly #65: 400+ projects signalling complete & more updates","author":"danny_cryptofay","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/cardano\/comments\/10ys8kd\/catalyst_weekly_65_400_projects_signalling\/","text":"&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/0lzqxzy86dha1.png?width=2178&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1ec801a13c82ff983bad53637081a0582fc48421\n\n# Hello there, beautiful soul!\n\nHope this message finds you well.  \n\n\nThis week, Project Catalyst has crossed another significant milestone.

He literally says \"not your keys, not your crypto\". In addition, he talks about disclosures and how you as an investor having the right to know what a custodian is doing with your crypto.\n\nIt should be obvious to anyone - Gary is clearly talking about the risks of giving up custody. What happened last year in the crypto space with centralized lenders and institutions was nothing short of a massacre, worse than anyone could have imagined. Scam upon scam. Scam squared. The SEC is moving fast to reduce systematic risk, ie. people giving up custody of their assets on (potentially) unregulated exchanges, etc.\n\nAlthough he didn't explicitly say it, on-chain Cardano staking is fine. The Cardano staking mechanism is literally best-in-industry. When you stake, you do not give up custody of your assets, and your tokens are not even subject to a lock-up period, they're fully liquid! And finally - no one is able to punish you by slashing your assets, unlike on Ethereum. As a result, there is no chance for Cardano staking to cause or contribute to systematic risk. There is no risk for the \"everyday retail investor\" the SEC wants to protect.\n\nETH is a completely different beast, and in fact if this discussion were to get heated, Ethereum is likely to work as a shield from the SEC in front of us since it's such an easier target.\n\nThe only possible effect that Cardano could possibly feel is simply US investors being unable to receive staking yield on centralized exchanges, potentially leading the laziest of retail investors to get rid of their ADA in favor of another coin without staking. Anyone \"not lazy\" can just withdraw and stake themselves.\n\nTL;DR - it's literally even more fine than people even realize.

While there are many platforms that support NFT transactions, **Cardano and Solana are two of the most talked-about platforms in this space after the leader - Ethereum.** However, there is a clear difference between these two platforms, especially when it comes to security, growth potential, and overall functionality.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/7b0mqy12xcha1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=45e3b6e7aae78691a581f808471bc6545fec386b\n\nIn terms of NFT volume, **Cardano is still in its early stages, but this is not necessarily a negative thing. In fact, it presents a significant opportunity for growth**, as there is a lot of room for expansion in the NFT space on the platform. **Cardano has a strong and growing community of developers and NFT enthusiasts who are driving the growth of NFTs on the platform.** This community is focused on innovation, and it is committed to creating a secure, scalable, and user-friendly NFT ecosystem on Cardano.\n\nOn the other hand, Solana, despite its high NFT volume, does not have the same level of security and growth potential as Cardano. Solana's NFT ecosystem is largely driven by its fast transaction processing speed, but it lacks the level of security and reliability that is so important in the NFT space. **As a result, Solana may not be the best choice for those who are looking for a secure and long-term investment in the NFT space.**\n\nCheck out the weekly trading volume for the week of February 4th to 10th in the image below. **You'll see that Cardano's volume is much lower compared to Ethereum and only about 15% of Solana's. But don't let that fool you!** Cardano has a killer community, active developers, and a safe, speedy, and cheap blockchain for NFTs. With all these positives and room to grow, **Cardano NFT market is poised to blow up in the near future.**  \n\n\n[Source: CryptoSlam.io](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/49bpq8p2xcha1.png?width=703&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b7137e17ec714c91c3660646f5e07ce939697c2d)\n\nIn conclusion, **Cardano presents a unique opportunity for those who are looking for a secure and scalable NFT platform with significant growth potential.** The platform's focus on security, scalability, and innovation sets it apart from other NFT platforms, including Solana.

None of the PoS blockchains can offer this but Ouroborus Genesis will make Cardano the first PoS blockchain with this capability.\n\nHow? Here's a Thread...\n\nOuroboros Genesis is a highly anticipated upgrade to the consensus protocol of Cardano in 2022. This upgrade is designed to address the issues of costless simulation and the bootstrapping problem and mitigate the threat of long-range attacks in a decentralized, open environment.\n\nTo understand how Ouroborus Genesis will give Cardano the same security guarantees of Bitcoin.\n\nWe need to start from the basics to understand this topic from a first principles perspective!\n\n# For that let's start form Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin uses an immutable ledger with strong security guarantees through PoW  This provides a high level of security  & enables a decentralized and secure network structure   Which allows parties to join and leave the network at will (a.k.a. Dynamic Availability)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/s633hfg2vcha1.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0685f4b6cd7b230e178af9bb1ca9b5c531d8eb69\n\nSo, how does that work? PoW uses computational resources, specifically the process of hashing, to produce new blocks, meaning, adding a block to the Bitcoin blockchain requires using processing power, resulting in energy consumption for each block added to the chain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/80nkkrh3vcha1.png?width=839&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e559cf302c16ad59da8286b751a96ceb459a82da\n\nThe difficulty of producing a chain increases with its length, making it computationally expensive to produce blocks. Meaning, adding blocks to a blockchain requires processing power, so a longer blockchain uses more energy, and nodes will always choose it over a shorter one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/asao47u4vcha1.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=70f4f69cc128263c2138a047cc3b3fe94566cd21\n\nThis expense, which is in the form of electricity costs, prevents dishonest nodes from producing multiple different blocks. As a result, nodes will always adopt the chain with the most energy consumed - commonly referred to as the \u201clongest chain.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/xudos7y5vcha1.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7cf5f55e06617f1a595c840c86c1c95166a438fa\n\nThis makes it easier for the new nodes joining the system to select the honest chain, which in turn allows the network (validators) to join & leave the network at any given time and keep the network secure. In short, this enables the dynamic availability of the Bitcoin network.\n\nBut PoW comes with some problems. As PoW relies on puzzle-solving, that becomes harder as more parties join the network. This leads to an ever-increasing demand for energy, which has become a major concern for the future of the network and it also creates \"Composability issues\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/fcbnxy17vcha1.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bde48497af23a9d7a938a7c9cd23bbb277809431\n\nComposability refers to the ability of different protocols or systems to work together seamlessly,  without introducing unintended consequences or breaking their intended functionality. But in the case of Bitcoin, reliance on PoW creates composability issues.\n\nIn PoW blockchains, issues can arise when other protocols use the same cryptographic puzzle-solving process as mining. Miners can potentially try to double the value of their effort by using the same hash query for both chains, leading to inefficiencies & security vulnerabilities.\n\nDue to these limitations of PoW, the search was on for an alternative mechanism to secure the ledger.  This led to the introduction of proof-of-stake (PoS) systems, which use virtual resources (stake) to secure the network instead of physical resources (hashing power).\n\nPoS systems are based on the idea that PoS systems can enhance scalability & energy efficiency while preserving security features of the ledger, by allowing parties to extend the blockchain based on the number of coins they own instead of relying on computing power.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/iy5d9u98vcha1.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=aa0e0cd6fc0089fe6975afbf0e664f6309213a19\n\nAlthough several PoS-based proposals have been developed over time with formal security proofs. It does come with some trade-offs, in particular, these protocols can restrict the dynamic availability of participants compared to PoW-based systems. Why? let's dig a bit deeper!\n\nAlthough PoS protocols are more scalable & energy efficient, they currently have some fundamental drawbacks. Among these are:\n\n* the nothing-at-stake \/ costless simulation problem\n* long-range attacks\n* and the Bootstrapping problem\n\nAs no physical resources are needed to produce blocks in PoS, it is possible to build an alternative history of the blockchain and create multiple competing chains at no cost, where in PoW, energy costs must be incurred for each competing chain.\n\nThe nothing-at-stake problem\/costless simulation occurs when a block producer evaluates the likelihood of two branches A and B, of a blockchain and decides to work on both rather than just one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ijpsese9vcha1.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3842b2f24bdae63681d7843a3a715a06d67ec6f0\n\nThis results in the block producer having a higher expected reward and no chain containing the highest stake leading to the network not reaching a consensus on the canonical branch. The costless simulation then results in another problem known as long-range attacks.\n\nHere the attacker builds a long chain by forking from an earlier point in the primary blockchain and continues to add blocks to this chain. This makes it difficult for new participants to determine which chain to support.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ja2bga0bvcha1.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b4d20eca9bd493a316a95d65eeae6dd80779ea71\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo mitigate this, checkpoints are established along the blockchain and any fork starting before a checkpoint is considered invalid. However, for new participants or validators who have been offline for a period of time, it can be difficult to determine the longest chain.\n\nThis makes them vulnerable to joining a malicious chain and this gives rise to the \u201cBootstrapping Problem\u201d where new validators joining the network potentially end up joining the malicious chain  increasing the network\u2019s vulnerability to long-range attacks.\n\n# So how does PoS survive?\n\nSo now let's take a look at how PoS-BFT protocols like (Ethereum, Algorand, etc.) try to solve the problem of costless simulation. In PoS BFT protocols, the consensus is reached among the nodes running the protocol on all blocks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/9tgo7pybvcha1.png?width=662&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2a553493b3646ef5499573dbd9205546ba70bb9a\n\nThis eliminates the occurrence of forks, and thereby, the need to resolve disagreements. However, in order to effectively operate the protocol must be aware of the level of participation of nodes in the network at any given time.\n\nBecause its impossible to make the network dynamically available & also know the level of participation at the same time. With PBFT; you throw away dynamic availability. On top of that Ethereum implements measures like freezing staked coins & slashing to deter malicious activity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/mfyzp27dvcha1.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4a7416f468c045da12172e11dd11995caa6268ca\n\nThis disincentivizes the involvement of honest parties with smaller stakes in the network, thereby decreasing the decentralization of the Ethereum network. So now let's take a look at how Cardano is taking the problem of Costless Simulation with the Ouroborus praos protocol.\n\nOuroboros Praos is the current consensus mechanism used in Cardano, and it takes a different approach to ensure the security and integrity of the network  compared to traditional consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work (PoW) or PoS-BFT protocols.\n\nKey word: **Verifiable Random Function (VRF)** A verifiable random function is a cryptographic function  that takes a series of inputs, computes them and produces a pseudorandom output along with a proof of authenticity that can be verified by anyone. How is it used by Praos?\n\nIt uses a VRF to elect a node as the slot leader for each block. Here's how it works: Before each epoch, a stake distribution snapshot is taken, the previous epoch\u2019s randomness seed is used as input for the VRF of each node, this is used to generate a pseudo-random number.\n\nThe node with the highest number becomes the slot leader and creates the block, encrypting the number into the block header. All other nodes use their own VRF to validate the election outcome.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/7kyb0j5evcha1.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9944195e5be7a70ec1316c837136c2d48bda5841\n\nThe protocol restricts that a slot leader cannot extend the chain with multiple blocks for the same slot,  therefore all honest parties extend their chain by at most one block per slot. This prevents malicious behaviour of slot leaders.\n\nThe outcome of the slot leader election is not revealed until the block is signed or the node wins itself.  At the end of each epoch, all the numbers encrypted into the block headers are combined and it is used to calculate the randomness seed for the next epoch.\n\nThis creates an endless cycle of\n\n* Stake distribution snapshot\n* VRF generation\n* and randomness seed calculation\n\nthat repeats throughout each epoch\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/chl4fk4fvcha1.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=364688098e135f938c3e1d1c534ab73f6edfbbd6\n\nThe blockchain is maintained through the longest chain rule, meaning, the slot leaders add a block to the end of the longest chain they have observed and then broadcast it to the network. But how does Ouroboros praos resist long-range attacks?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/v5buv75gvcha1.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=230ef0ff54f575828ec2ce6dd335728a1e39e96d\n\nIn praos, a form of rolling checkpointing is employed to prevent a long-range attack. This is known as the \"bounded-depth longest-chain rule\u201d  i.e., the nodes adopt a valid new chain. Only if it is longer & does not fork by more than \"k\" blocks from the local chain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/7n6v779hvcha1.jpg?width=680&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f67a33de70b869540f1db43c92edc68b63debc93\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut this comes with two main limitations,\n\n1st one:\n\n* The Online parties maintain a moving checkpoint\n\nMeaning, the newly joined parties would need trusted advice. This is not desirable when it comes to decentralization (The bootstrapping problem).\n\n2nd one :\n\n* There is a fixed & known lower bound on participation\n\nMeaning, protocol must be aware of the minimum no: of participants at any given time. Meaning, no flexible participation. The protocol might be stalled if there is a sudden drop in the no: of validator nodes.\n\nThis is most probably the reason why Cardano stalled for ca. 7 minutes during the event last month,  which caused a huge number of nodes  (>50%) to go offline, and when those nodes came back online  the protocol picked it from there and started producing blocks again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/1s7sv3divcha1.jpg?width=891&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f7b933506471adc9f1967dc30eb0a820dc270d06\n\nBecause of the above mentioned limitations of the \"Ouroborus praos\"  Cardano cannot currently allow dynamic participation, the ability of validators to join or leave the network in a flexible, constantly changing manner without disrupting the functioning of the network.\n\nAnd as a matter of fact, none of the PoS blockchains can allow dynamic participation. Protocols like Algorand would stall if there was a sudden drop in participation of more than 30% of nodes at any given time, but **Ouroborus genesis can enable dynamic participation**. How?\n\nOuroboros Genesis introduces the Plenitude Rule. A game-changing \"chain selection solution\" that solves the bootstrapping problem by allowing the new nodes joining the network to detect the honest chain, without any trusted information.  So how does it work?\n\nResearchers have proved that, if the majority of parties follow the protocol, then at any sufficiently long time segment, the honest chain will be denser, especially after a fork, meaning, adversarial chains shortly after forking exhibit a less dense block distribution.\n\nSo when multiple chains of similar length are available, the Plenitude Rule looks for the point at which the chains diverge regarding their block distribution, it then divides the most recent past from the history of the chain into periods.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/m59esk9jvcha1.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=78e1494fc76edaf963478495fa3511bf15624f26\n\nAnd then determines which chain has the densest block distribution, after the divergence point\/forking, then the nodes in the network can adopt a chain, which also has the densest block distribution after forking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/2pczf82kvcha1.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5af4d0ac466783975bf6611913972e6e32601f89\n\nSo with Ouroborus Genesis, the nodes that are new to the network or have been offline for a while can re-join and be guaranteed to download the correct version of the chain, as long as there are enough honest parties (an assumption that Bitcoin also makes).\n\nFurthermore, with Plenitude Rule \"Ouroborus genesis\" makes it possible to guarantee that no one can counterfeit their way into creating a block during someone else\u2019s slot, making it impossible for a single node to create a fake chain.\n\nSo \u201cThe Genesis version\u201d of the Ouroborus protocol will be the first PoS protocol that is mathematically proven to guarantee persistence & liveness in both synchronous & semi-synchronous settings under the assumption of an honest majority participating. just like Bitcoin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nOuroboros Genesis will make Cardano more secure than other PoS protocols  - that requires at least 2\/3 honest participants (e.g. Ethereum Casper, Algorand) and is equally secure as Bitcoin but with much lower energy expenditure & better performance.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1675973339.0},{"title":"Ardana just tweeted something for the time in months","author":"maxonly1","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ArdanaProject\/status\/1623730445610364928","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1675965288.0},{"title":"WHAT IF....(re Staking)","author":"Human-Contribution16","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/cardano\/comments\/10ymdpp\/what_ifre_staking\/","text":"The SEC is looking to crack down on staking.

However, it is not necessary to understand the exact definition of these terms, but rather the details of the characteristics of blockchain networks. As you will see in the article, the topic has many nuances. \n\n# TLDR\n\n* The term decentralized is focused on control over the network and the absence of a central authority. \n* The term distributed mainly refers to the geographical distribution of nodes to improve efficiency, availability, and reliability.\n* The nodes in blockchain networks are not equal. Some have more decision-making power.\n* Even if the network consensus is distributed over multiple nodes, the network may tend to the centralization of power through control of the resource. \n* It is very difficult to achieve a high degree of decentralization at the project management or source code change level.\n\n# Let's look at the definitions\n\nThe term \"decentralized\" originated from the field of political science, economics, and sociology, where it was used to describe systems and organizations that lack a central authority or hierarchy. The concept of decentralization was first used in these fields to describe political systems, such as federalism, where power is distributed among different levels of government.\n\nIn the context of computer science and information technology, the term decentralized was later adopted to describe networks, systems, and applications that lack a central point of control or a central authority. This concept was applied to the development of peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, where data and resources are shared directly between nodes without the need for intermediaries.\n\nThis article was prepared by[ Cardanians](https:\/\/cardanians.io\/en) with support from[ Cexplorer](https:\/\/cexplorer.io\/).\n\n**Read the article**: https:\/\/cexplorer.io\/article\/is-cardano-a-decentralized-or-distributed-network","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1675840588.0},{"title":"Cardano Daily Discussion - February 08, 2023","author":"SL13PNIR","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/cardano\/comments\/10wpiqc\/cardano_daily_discussion_february_08_2023\/","text":"Hello everyone,\n\nWelcome to the Cardano Daily Discussion!\n\n*The standard sub rules apply here (see sidebar), with the exception that price discussion is allowed in this thread, though we encourage you to try not to make this the focus and talk about the project itself.

Cardano stands out from other blockchain platforms due to its **use of a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm, which allows for a more energy-efficient and decentralized network compared to proof-of-work (PoW)** algorithms used by other blockchains.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/l9qmfsze6rga1.png?width=1165&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c58257538f513703ac90bb0b1a7c6bcb34e3b127\n\nThere are several reasons why Cardano is well-suited for NFTs. First and foremost, its PoS consensus algorithm allows for **fast and cheap transactions, making it easy and affordable for users to buy and sell NFTs.** This is particularly important for the art and collectibles market, where high transaction fees can be a barrier to entry for potential buyers.\n\nIn addition to its fast and cheap transactions, **Cardano also has a strong focus on governance and regulatory compliance. This is crucial for the development of NFTs in the art and collectibles market**, as it helps to ensure the authenticity and provenance of the items being traded. By providing a secure and transparent platform for the creation and trade of NFTs, Cardano helps to build trust and confidence among its users.\n\nFinally, **Cardano has a large and active community of developers and users**, which helps to ensure the long-term viability and growth of the platform. This active community helps to drive innovation and adoption of NFTs on the platform, making it a key player in the growing NFT market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/wxp0u6sf6rga1.png?width=1630&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ee9a82867b97e69ed351d142f029b1cdb810b915\n\nIn conclusion, **Cardano is an excellent choice for the development and use of NFTs** due to its fast and cheap transactions, strong focus on governance and regulatory compliance, and active community of developers and users. Its decentralized and open-source nature also makes it a **secure and transparent platform for the creation and trade of unique digital assets.**  \n\n\nRead more articles on [https:\/\/blog.jamonbread.io\/en](https:\/\/blog.jamonbread.io\/en) or go directly to the marketplace and discover the CNFT space here: [https:\/\/jamonbread.io\/](https:\/\/jamonbread.io\/)","upvote_ratio":0.84,"created_utc":1675769951.0},{"title":"How actively do people use Cardano?","author":"Cardanians","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/cardano\/comments\/10vz8fc\/how_actively_do_people_use_cardano\/","text":"Public blockchain networks have one big advantage when it comes to measuring activity. Thanks to on-chain analytics, we can know exactly how many people have exchanged digital assets with each other over a certain period. Activity on the network is one of the main indicators of the health of the ecosystem.

Let's take a look at how active people are on the Cardano network and compare the numbers to other networks.
