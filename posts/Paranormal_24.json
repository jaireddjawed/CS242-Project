It was a normal dream, not a nightmare. I didn’t open my eyes, I didn’t change position. I was lying on my right side with my right hand stretched out of the bed, hanging above the bedside drawer and pointing to the corner of the room. Belly pain kept me away from sleeping, so I was lying and thinking about approaching periods and planning when I could visit a doctor.\n\nAs then I felt something touched my hand! It touched me in the middle of the palm and the opposite side of a hand and glided down to the fingers. \n\nIt didn’t feel like normal touch, like fingers or even a skin. I’d rather call it fur or hair. But it was like if the hairs were charged. English is not my native language but I couldn’t explain it better even in my mother tongue.\n\nI screamed and pulled my hand to the body. My hand wasn’t numb. It felt okay. But I still could feel the touch on it. \n\nWhat was this?",

        "text": "I was a foreigner living in Asia when I met my wife. She too was a foreigner. She had just split up with her ex-husband a citizen of the country we were living in. The split was caused by mental cruelty over a span of years. The last straw was when he would not let her go home to be with her mother as she lay on her death bed.\n\nAfter several months of dating and living together, we married. After a short holiday, we returned to our tiny apartment. It was an Asian-style  efficiency. The type where you enter through the kitchen, took a few steps to the living room and then a few more steps brought you to the bedroom.\n\nThe night after our return. around 1am, I woke up and went to the kitchen for a drink of water. As I was standing at the sink I picked up the scent of lilacs, which are out-of-season in October. I sensed something behind me and then felt a soft touch upon my shoulder. A hand? I froze. Someone began to speak.  It was in my wife's native language, a language that I had yet to learn. It was woman's voice, low, raspy and weak. Instead a fear, I felt nothing but calm and kindness. The hand left my shoulder and I quickly took the few steps to the bedroom and woke my wife. I looked and then pointed toward the kitchen, where I could clearly see a white mist begin to dissipate. \n\nMy wife had tears in her eyes and said that she saw her mother. I explained to her what I felt, heard and saw. She told me that her mother had died from cancer of the larynx. In the weeks before her death, she could barely speak at all. At her funeral, her casket was surrounded by her favorite flower, the lilac. I didn't know what to think of this. Did she mention all of this to me before and it was coming out of my subconscious while I was sleepwalking? I did have a history of that. But why did she see her mother too? All I saw was a mist. Isn't it impossible to share the same dream? \n\nThe next morning, early, there was a knocking on the front door. I opened the door and was startled to see my wife's ex-husband standing there. He looked upset. My wife came to the door and he explained to her that he was flying to her home country that evening. This is because that during the night, he was visited by the spirit of my wife's mother. He said that he woke and saw her standing at the foot of his bed She was shaking her head and he felt that she was mad at him. He was scared and was going to her grave to pray for her forgiveness.\n\nSo, that's how I met my Mother-In-Law.  She never paid us a visit again.\n\nNote: I believe that spirits visit us not physically, but psychically. My wife saw her mother. I, having never met or was shown a photo of her, saw a white, shapeless mist. There was no pre-existing template in my mind for her to use. That's just my theory.",

        "text": "So my (f33) best friend (f33) asked me to share this here after long discussions , since she doesn’t have an account. \n\nHer uncle passed away after a year long fight with cancer, a few weeks before Christmas. They lived in different countries, and could only speak on the phone. They were very close, he was her favourite uncle and the youngest. He was quite religious, liked to go to church and all that. At the same time , he was quite independent and proud, he hid his illness for months, he never wanted to be a burden. In the last moths in the hospital, he was grumpy towards everyone, he was ashamed to be seen like that. \n\n2 weeks before he passed, my bf had this dream where he was in a bad mood, refusing to see anyone, just repeating he needs to go to church before Christmas. My friend suggested to his wife to bring a priest, since he was so religious, maybe it’d do him good. In the dream , the wife got so offended, cause doing that was accepting he’s dying, and she was refusing to believe that, she was still planning to take him home. Knowing the wife and the moods, my friend forgot the dream knowing it’d have the exact same reaction. \n\n2 weeks later, he was really bad, so my friend suggested the priest thing to his wife, and obviously, she received the expected offended reaction. \n\nThat night, my friend had a rough night, describing it like she wasn’t sure if she was sleeping or awake ( she’s not familiar with lucid dreaming) and she “dreamed” she was in the hospital room with her uncle, he was up and well, he looked good and healthy, he thanked her, hugged her and kind of said take care, like a farewell. He was in peace and well, and my friend hugged him and kind of understood. \n\nNext morning, she woke up to her mom crying. The first think my bf asked was : did he pass at 2am (when she had the dream)  ? Her mom was hysterical in her pain, and was like wtf of a question is that? \n\nShe later found out : that night he got worse. The wife desperate, asked him if he’d like to talk to a priest ( being pre-holidays and all) and he accepted. They called and the priest came in the middle of the night. He talked with him for like an hour, and when they were done, he passed immediately in front of the priest, holding his hand .\n\n\nNow. I believe my friend somehow communicated with her uncle, sent him the priest he asked for, and helped him move on. She had the chance to say goodbye. \n\nShe’s not familiar with lucid dreaming and lots of stuff, so we thought someone here could explain better what she experienced. \n\n(Something similar happened to me years ago, she knows about it, but she’s not familiar with it and she’s doesn’t understand, she’s overwhelmed).\n\nThank you for any input and light!\nLots of love!",

        "text": "\nI have been considering long time ago to write this story down. This is a personal experience without any fantasy element or “lie”. \n\nFrankly speaking, I have never experienced any kind of supernatural or paranormal thing and this is the main reason why I was hesitating before write the post. But here we go, I am interested in your thoughts and comments on the story. \n\nThe beginning of the story starts one and a half years ago. I and my girlfriend went on vacation to an Eastern European country. The exact location is not important but the site was around 500 km far from our home.\nWe had agreed with one of my distant relatives to we were going to stay at their house during the last two days of the vacation. His house was not far from where we had spent our vacation. \n\nTo put into context the circumstances, they live in a very small countryside village in the middle of a vast forest. \nThe village has around 400 inhabitants so a really tiny one. ( most of them are elders of course)\n\nThe first day and night went just fine and dandy but we agreed that they were going to leave the house on our last day because they had to go to another relative or something like that. Meaning that we had been left on our own in the house for the last night.\nEnd of the background story, things are getting tenser now.\n\nSo, we were not in the house during the daytime we only arrived back around 7-8 pm so in the evening. Just right after we entered the house we were getting felt a very strange feeling. Both of us simultaneously. There were not any extraordinary or odd things, not even a single voice, all calm but we felt an utter fear. \nI mean literally. \nIt came from nowhere, out of blue but the feeling was very intense. We even went out to the courtyard to get some fresh air. Went back but the situation was not getting better. I can not explain why we were so frightened of what caused the experience but it was terrible.\nWe felt like we are in some sort of a danger.\nEven considered leaving the house and going home during the evening, but the home was about 450 km far away and we were very tired at that point. Eventually, we went back into the house locked the door, and tried to get some sleep. \nUnsurprisingly it did not work, because we were completely frightened and we just sat in silence and listen. To be honest I get goosebumps when I think about it. \nThere was no voice no knock nothing but that very bad feeling like something very bad is going to happen. We were so frightened..\nEventually, we fell asleep and nothing happened during the night but in the morning we packed our stuff as fast as we could, and off we went.\n\nWell, we have no explanation for the story, I have never experienced such a thing before and it was shocking. I know it is not only shocking but unbelievable as well. I did not mention this experience to my relative tho. \n\nSorry for the wall of text, I am very eager to hear any kind of feedback about the story.",

        "text": "Hey all! Let me start out by saying I live in Massachusetts, normally people think one of four things location wise for MA. Boston, Cape Cod, Salem and the rest. The rest I have taken to calling spooky woods. This is about some spooky words in Western Massachusetts.\n\nI bought my house almost exactly a year ago. It's a two story brick square that was built in 1920. A lot of people think it had a commercial use before it was used as a house. It's almost 500 feet away from the road with a gravel drive that I and delivery peeps don't much care for. I've seen a couple things out of the corner of my eye, like a brown cat. The only thing my cats have ever alerted me to has been a mouse in the walls. But the most important detail is my backyard is woods.\n\nMy backyard is a conservation area so it won't ever be developed into housing. I've seen bears (with cubs), deer, bobcat, opossums, owls, and lots of other little critters. I've heard even more, which brings me to an event that happened about a couple weeks ago... actually, thinking better of it, it happened at the end of Autumn, when my partner found a fairy ring of mushrooms and not only stepped into the middle but also poked every mushroom there. Thanks Darling, why not just leave the door open for the fae to show up.\n\nAnyway, since he's played with the fairy circle I've kept an ear and eye out for weirdness and pretty much said to the woods that his prodding was not an invitation inside. Then Winter came and it got cold here, and still is.\n\nOn this night, a couple weeks ago, it was about 2 or 3am in the morning, the temperature was a single digit, but my phone said it felt like -3F. Both me and my partner wake up together, for no real reason that we were able to figure out. We have neighbors to the sides of us, but they're quiet at night (one side has an HOA, and is pretty much silent as death after 10pm), our other neighbor is right by the road. We acknowledged that we're awake to each other, one of the cats is very excited we're awake and wants to cuddle. We're unsuccessfully trying to push him away when we all hear it.\n\nWhistling.\n\nIt was so light that the cat's purrs were able to block it out, but he stopped purring and we all heard the whistling in the woods. It was a jaunty little tune, like someone enjoying a stroll. Except it was ridiculously cold out, and it was coming. from. the. WOODS!\n\nIt only lasted for a few seconds and then the cat went back to purring and blocked out if it went longer. Haven't heard it since. Part of me likes to think it was a happy custodian in the high school that I can sometimes just barely hear the loud pep rallies of, but the larger part knows I call these Spooky Woods for a reason.",

        "text": "So some important background info, my family has owned our property since around the time my mom was little so for around 42 years now. \n\nGrowing up, there was this house on our property that was locked up tight and basically falling apart inside that we unfortunately didn’t have the money to demolish yet. Inside there wasn’t really anything of value, there was a massive wasp nest that I swear was the size of a dumpster (at least to my kid brain), and rat nests everywhere. That locked up house had been on the property before my family purchased it and for a long while after. \n\nWhen we finally got the money to demolish it I was around 10-11, my grandfather went inside a couple times to clean it out a bit to see if there were any valuables in the rat nests or stowed away elsewhere. He hadn’t bothered to check before. During one of his searches, he found this old locket. It was sorta old with a unicorn and rainbow on the front of it with a digital clock inside that was busted. Little kid me loved it and asked to have it, so he let me keep it. \n\nFor the few days it took for the house to be demolished, I had awful luck. My favorite action figure broke, my favorite SNES game lost all my saved data, etc. Until one night after the house was finally demolished, I had a vivid nightmare that some awful shadow woman monster appeared from where the house had once been, grabbed the locket off of my neck through my bedroom window, and took off in a swoosh of smoke. In the morning I couldn’t find the locket at all and needless to say I was extremely freaked out. \n\nI remembered it and looked for it about a week a year for a long time, eventually deciding it was lost. That is until I hit 23 last year. I FOUND IT. \n\nI found it upstairs in the attic where I know I’d never been because I wasn’t allowed to play in there due to splinters and it being super hot in the eves. I swear my hot stopped and  got this awful eerie feeling from looking at it, but I also felt this tugging inside that I couldn’t just leave it there. So I took it. My luck sucked for a solid week after I found it, but I was and still am incapable of getting rid of it. I hid it in a drawer and just don’t touch it. \n\nI’m wondering if this pendant is cursed, haunted, or just an object of unfortunate coincidence.",

She teaches biology, anatomy, and anthropology at UCSD and often works with real human remains in her teachings. She was lecturing on human development, and disassembled a child’s skull to show the plates and how they fuse, etc… however, she didn’t reassemble them before coming home.\n\nLate that night, I don’t know - maybe 2:00am, I go to the bathroom, do my thing, and when I get back in bed she stirs and says something like, “wait, we’re you just in the bathroom?, and I’m like, “yeah, why?” confused. She shrugs it off, “I thought we were cuddling”.\n\nThe next day she explained that she felt me (not me) holding her from behind, but the more she thought about it, it was smaller, childlike. She ends up explaining it away as a dream and we just let it go. \n\nA few nights later she goes to bed early leaving me in our living room. A few minutes later, I hear a scream and she runs downstairs looking truly terrified. She claims to have seen a shadowy figure next to the nightstand on my side of the bed. She described it as the size of the child and staticy, like when a TV doesn’t have signal. It looked like it was rummaging through my nightstand, and when she entered the room, it got spooked and quickly disappeared into our closet. \n\nOnce she was calm, she again tried to rationalize it. Oh it was the wind (no windows were open), or it was just a weird shadow from the lights coming on (in the shape of a child?). She maintains her skepticism, but does claim there was a lonely energy, again childlike, like a little kid searching for their mom.  \n\nThe weirdest part of this is that the next class day she reassembled the skull and nothing happened again.

I had never and to this day ever experienced anything odd or strange in this house or felt weird being there save for 1 night. \n\nI was laying in bed, my cat is in the room with me on the floor. I hear what sounds like foot steps just walking back and forth around my bed. I just try to ignore it until they get heavier and faster almost like someone is speed walking. It isn't consistent they would walk to one side, stop for moments or a couple minutes then would just start on the other side of the bed. Then my xbox in my room turns on by itself. The controller is on my dresser so I didn't roll on it or something. I get up turn it off and get back in bed, I am beginning to feel afraid at this point. \n\nThe footsteps stop for what seems like a while until I hear my cat start to growl, I sit up and look over to her and she is on her side growling and focused on something in the corner of my room by the door. There is nothing there. She continues to do that growl that cats do when they are irritated or ready to fight as well as flicking her tail and visibly the hair on her back is standing up. I am terrified and want to run to my dad's room but as I said this is in the corner by the door of my room and I was afraid the the moment I start to run I'm going to get snatched by something.\n\nOut of the corner of my eye I notice what looks like a white stream of light flash across my mirror almost like a car or something was pulling into my driveway outside but not as bright or intense, I know this isn't the case because its late at night, we live in the middle of no where, and someone would have to be by our house for that to happen. at this moment I make a run for it, I reach my dads room and he walks me back to my bed and talks to me for about 15 minutes calming me down. \n\nNothing more happened the rest of that night. I haven't had anything like that happen again. Just an interesting story I thought Id share that I think about from time to time and still freaks me out as an adult.",

I don't really believe in those things and I'm regularly sceptical when it comes to the paranormal. This happened to me when I was 17 and in highschool and living with my parents. My house at the time was in a very small town, the backyard faced open empty fields and mountains for miles before you reached another civilization at all. My best friend lived next door and shared this field as our backyard in a way. I have to explain that his house sat was built on a different street that ended in the field with a small culdesac. I think there was supposed to be more houses built down this street to expand the town but they clearly never got around to it. So his driveway was basically in this culdesac even though no other houses were built there. This matters later in the story. I used to stay the night at my friend's house a lot in highschool because I didn't have the best relationship with my parents. Every once in a while we would wake up to hear dragging and a weird gargling sound from the back porch. (His room was a basement room with the window well to the back porch.) It would happen maybe a couple times a month but whenever we would gather the courage to check. Nothing would be back there. This happened for years. One night haunts my friend and I to this day. My friend was getting ready to move and we would stay up all night playing games and watching movies. We decided to go on a music drive to just vibe. So we hopped in his truck with high beams and swung out of the driveway turning them on towards the field to use the roundabout. The light illuminated this... Thing. It looked like a person but it wasn't. It was naked on all fours. Abnormally large, particularly it's limbs that seemed to fold under itself in an unnatural way. It's pale skin clung to it like it had to be stretched onto it. But the part I'll still sends shivers down my spine is it's face. It's jaw hung open to this gaping black maw, like a snake unhinging it's jaw to eat. It's black eyes glistened in the light as it looked at us. But just as it turned to see us, it quickly scurried backwards almost like it was on rewind into the brush of the field. My friend and I were pale as ghosts. We both looked at each other like \"did you see that too?\" We were shaken. Let's just say we tried to have a good rest of the night but we couldn't believe what we saw. We ended up just sitting there in his basement with guns ready and waiting to hear the gargling and dragging again, but we never did. Sorry that it's not very climactic but it's the truth. I now don't live in that town anymore. There are times when I visit there though. That empty field still feels like it's watching and waiting. Even though I can't see it, I can still feel like it's out there.",

        "text": "I never felt alone and now I know why\n\nI (24f) grew up in a a 4 bedroom country house I always believed to be haunted. It was a 4 bedroom, double story house with plenty of garden space for me and my 2 siblings to play in (me 7, sister 9 and brother 13). Since I was young,  I remember my family mentioning my sleep walking, I never woke up in strange places or remember being startled awake, yet I can recall this being discussed well into my adulthood. \n\nMy siblings, being older, always tried to scare me with the idea of our house being haunted. They told me stories of Mrs Maisel that died in the house and like to abduct little misbehaving girls. Being the youngest I believed every word and \"tried\" to be the best behaving little the girl in the house so she would take my sister instead. \n\nWhen my parents started mentioning strange things happening in the house, I assumed it was Mrs Maisel and told them so. Taps in the siblings shared bathroom would open at night, the baby gate for our Yorkies would be opened at the top of the stairs etc. Small things would occur that my parents would eventually blame on me and sleepwalking as my door would be the only one open during their findings.\n\nEverything seemed innocent enough until my sister (10 at that time) said she was was pushed down the stairs one night while going to the loo. Our shared bathroom was across a small hall past the stairs. She luckily didn't suffer major injuries (just her right arm broken) but she also didn't see who had done it. Because of my sleepwalking and my brother sleeping in the downstairs living room that night, it was assumed that it was me.\n\nThese are the main instances I remember as at the age of around 13, we moved into an apartment in the city and everything paranormal quieted down. I was sharing a room with my older sister that demanded to have some light in the room (the bathroom across) to be able to sleep. \n\nMy brother and sister moved out eventually to study and start their lives. By the time I turned 18, my parents started going through a divorce and my mother and I stayed in the flat as it was close to the uni I wanted to attend. \n\nI decided and applied to study psychology. I qualified for a partial scholarship that also covered half of the rent. Year 1-3 I used that money to help my mom out with rent. Year 4 was pretty stressful for me, I broke up with my first serious bf, I started going out more with friends spending less time with my mom, the result was that I started to fail some of my subjects having to get a part time job to pay for re-takes.\n\nIt was during this time that my mom would accuse me of doing things I knew couldn't be true. Again like at the previous house, I was apparently opening and not shutting drawers,  I was leaving taps open, I was leaving the fridge door open, etc. I don't remember any of these things. I felt gaslit at this point and wanted to prove to her how insane this sounded. I made a big deal about sticking tape from one side of my door frame to the other at ankle height. If I were to sleepwalk across this, I would either trip or break the tape I thought. \n\nThe next morning I wake up and look at the doorway first thing, the tape was intact. I looked at my phone and saw that it was past 9 am, my mom didn't wake me up for class. I stepped over the tape and went to her room. As soon as I opened her door I could smell gas, it was winter and she had a gas heater in her room. I phoned emergency services and she was revived. After she came home she started dropping hints that it must've been me, sleepwalking, trying to kill her. I mentally gave up at this point, knowing I was innocent, looking for a new apartment. \n\nI found a place very close to campus although it wasn't looked after very well. I had to spend a small fortune to scrub that place up and down to even be livable. As I was nearing the end of my 4th year, I knew I had to repeat some subjects next  year and I had to find a second part time job to cover the difference of my scholarship. \n\nI started bartending at night, closing off and being home at 3am. My 9 am classes were difficult, but I made it work. Life was hectic but peaceful for the first 6 months. On the 7ish month of independence I started falling off the wagon. I went out more, dated more and started experimenting with substances. I started missing classes by prioritizing events, friends or recovery from hangovers above all else. \n\nI started sleepwalking again and would wake up to open  taps, the fridge emptied onto the floor, the cupboards open and bruises all over my body. I always thought the bruises on my body were proof of the destructive sleepwalking, so I never mentioned it to my family as a child. Now, my adult self had difficulty rationalizing finger grip bruises on my upper arms and skin-breaking scratches on my legs. \n\nI started going to a psychologist after I experienced hallucinations of moving shadows. I would feel awake, yet my shadow would be moving on the wall across my bed. My apartment would be ransacked by the time my alarm would go off and I would wake up with new bruises. I just couldn't deal with anything at this point and everything felt out of control. \n\nOne night the bar closed particularly late due to friends of the owner staying behind buying the staff drinks. I got home around 5am and decided to disable my alarms for the next day as I would sleep in. I sat on my bed when I had an idea, why not pour baby powder on my floor to see my sleepwalking in action the next day. Drunken thoughts led to drunken action, my floor was plastered with baby powder from the kitchen to the foot of my bed. \n\nI woke up the next morning forgetting about the dumb plan I had made and just looked at the baby powder mess from my bed. The only steps made were my own at that moment while thinking about the mess I had to clean. As soon as I stepped out of my bedroom, I saw the disaster in the kitchen. All the cupboards were open, the pots pans were on the floor, the fridge was open and the stove plates were on (luckilyelectricand not gas).\n\nI know what psychosis is and I don't want to mention my experience to anyone, but I know I didn't cause the strangulation marks on my neck or the scratches on my arms. I am almost a psychologist but I believe my shadow is haunted. I feel asif it feeds on my despair and if nothing is done, it will kill me.",

        "text": "Working from home isn't always the best idea\n\nWhen COVID hit I (31 M) was one of the lucky people able to work from home. As an IT technician for a bank, we were already trialing WFH months prior. When Lockdown hit, things were running pretty much smoothly with remote work. \n\nThe first two months at home alone was bliss to me, I don't really enjoy office interactions, small talk or the commute to work being 45 min away in heavy traffic. Audio only Zoom calls and a reasonably consistent delivery on my tasks were everything I could have wanted.\n\nThis arrangement luckily carried on after COVID. I was finally able to control my own time (within reason) and had no social obligation to interact with people. Other than a visit to my mom twice a month and meeting up with my best friend Alex every now and then for drinks, I was absolved of social obligations. I would go to the gym with headphones on and my groceries were being delivered via an app. I like to keep my own company and the pandemic had given me more blessings than curses in that regard. As long as my windows stayed shut, my aircon was set at an optimal temperature of 22°C and my wifi was on, I had no complaints. \n\nAfter 2 years of this lifestyle, strange things started happening that I couldn't explain. My laptop would be on the bedroom floor when I left it on the desk. The curtains would be drawn fully open when I wake up when I remember closing them at night. Small things at first, until the headaches started getting worse. \n\nOur team was on a Zoom meeting when I started hearing faint static. It sounded like being in between channels on t.v from my childhood. Brushing it off as a bad line or connection, I tried to focus past it  and on what my colleagues were saying. The noise grew louder so I eventually asked if anyone else was experiencing thr sound, no one was. The meeting continued while the static grew louder. I decided to reconnect to the meeting when the static started again. This time it sounded like a faint channel of a man speaking in the background. I disconnected and called my Fibre host to complain. I messaged my team alerting them to my internet issues and left it there. This was Friday at 12:00, we knock off at 13:00 so I decided to to take the day off until the Fibre people sorted it out.\n\nI had the whole weekend to myself so I decided to order some beers and pizza for delivery. Once I had placed my order I started reading a book, Olympos by Dan Simmons. I was on page 326 when I made the order, when I received the call that my order had arrived I was in the middle of page 327. An order does not come that quickly. I received the order from the door, thanked the delivery guy and looked at the time. I had placed my order 40 min ago, yet my internal time had passed as if it had ony been 5 or less.\n\nParanoid at this stage I stared to believe that the universe was screwing with me. I decided to call up my friend Alex for a video chat. We caught up for a bit and I told him about the strange occurrences I have been experiencing. Alex sounded interested at first until he started to change. He started to say things that were not only unlike him, but crossed the line to being cruel. He stared at me and told me how I would have more people in my life had I been different, how I could not expect him to be my only lifeline and that he had only sticked around out of pity. He reminded me that no one would ever love me as I lack any type of personality to love and that my father probably left because of me (I was 3 at the time).\n\nThis was not my friend of 25 years. As he said all this I did not recognize his tone, his message, his personality or in some seconds, his face. I was too cowardly to just close the laptop and leave, so I just sat there in silence bewildered. I just stared at the screen and so did he, nothing more was spoken and we both just stared. It might have been a minute, but it felt like an hour before his screen went black and the call was dropped.\n\nI went to get a beer and just debrief this whole interaction when I found the fridge already open. I grabbed a beer deciding one issue at a time, switched on the t.v and laid down on the couch. Before I had even finished the beer, I had fallen asleep to X-Files episodes playing in the background.\n\nI woke up with a headache from hell!!! A case of beer would not even deliver this type of punch. I had not had more than a slice of pizza the night before so I had a feast to look forward to luckily. I excitedly opened the pizza box left on the stove only to discover it covered in mould and 2 roaches scurrying away when I opened the lid. Confused I opened the fridge and found that all the perishables have rotted to some extent. I'm confused, I a starving and time seems to have slipped by my drastically.\n\nWhen I open the curtains it is still dark, I get my phone on the charger and it is 03:33 Wednesday. Work starts in 5 hours and I have been out of it for 5 nights, 4 days, 108,5 hours.\n\nI don't know what to do... I'm confused, I am scared and honestly, I don't know where to turn.",

        "text": "a couple nights ago i was staying up going on my phone and talking to friends, it was around two in the morning when i heard what sounded like my sister standing up and walking to her desk. we sleep in separate rooms that are right next to each other, so the combination of thin walls and wooden floors make it very easy to hear when someone is up. it brought my attention away from my phone and i listened to the sound, i could hear footsteps in her room but played it off as her just being an idiot until it sounded like they walked through the wall. i sat up but the sound was gone, i thought it might have been in the video so i rewinded and listened for it but it wasn't, i then heard a hard breath into my ear like a \"huff\" this freaked me out . the next day i invited my friend over for the night, partly because i wanted to see them but also because i was scared. we played games until about ten pm when we decided it would be better to set up the beds and just talk. about 20 minutes had past of us talking, i heard three knocks on my wall and told my friend it'll be my sister telling us to be quite so we lowered our volume and continued our conversation. until i heard my sisters voice yelling my name from her room. at the time i thought she was just being rude or maybe we were louder then intended, but when i woke up and asked my sister why she was being so rude about it she told me she had been asleep since 10, i thought she was joking until she showed her fitbit saying she had been asleep. i immediately called my friend who had left and confirmed to my skeptical sister that we both heard three distinct knocks and the yelling of my name in her voice from her room. the next night i heard a shuffle like someone had sat in my chair, i live in a pretty old house so creeks are a regular occurrence but this was not a creek, it didn't scare me that much though until i checked the time and it was exactly 12 in the morning. i'm actually so freaked out at this point and i don't know what to do which is why i'm even typing this out at all, i don't believe in paranormal activity or any of that stuff but now with no explanation for what i heard i just don't know what to think.",

        "text": "Hello, i want to share with you one of my most recent paranormal experience . I apologize in advance for my English as I am not a native speaker.It happened last year. I was 18 years old and I was just in my senior year. After a tiring bus ride , I finally arrived home. I went in and expected that there would be no one at home, as it is usual at this time, because I finished school earlier that day. Both of my parents were at work and my brother Michael and sister Alice were both supposed to be at school. Alice had a singing group after school and didn't come home until a  5 pm. To my surprise, she was sitting on the sofa in the living room, staring into her laptop as usual. I asked her what was she doing at home so early, to which she replied that she came home earlier ,because she was not feeling well. We talked like this for about 5 minutes about what we had experienced during the day and then I went upstairs to my room. The moment I threw off my clothes and put on my usual pants and a T-shirt, I realized that I hadn't locked the door. We always lock the door at home, as we live in a village where it is common for people to break in, or at least one of the neighbors can come in unannounced and wander around the house, which has happened to us a couple of times. I didn't want to go downstairs again, so I shouted at my sister to lock the door as she was closer to them. No response. I shouted again. No response again. I got angry because she ignored me in this way quite often when she didn't want to help me with something. Annoyed, I finally ran aggressively down the stairs with the intention of scolding her, but downstairs I saw an empty place where Alice had been sitting before. Not even a sign of  her being here before. I searched the whole house and noticed a couple of strange facts. 1. There were no Alice's shoes, which she would take off when she came home 2. There was no Alice's coat, which she would take off when she came home as well 3. The laptop was placed upstairs in her room, completely turned off - I would have heard her footsteps and the slamming of the door if she had gone put it away. I had a very overwhelming feeling, something was very wrong. I grabbed my phone and dialed her number. I was drenched in cold sweat and I felt a very demonic presence from all sides. Finally, she picked up. \"Are you crazy? Why are you calling me when you know I'm at school?\" These words  shocked me beyond measure and at the same time made me even more angry. I called her a liar and told her that she was  at home less than ten minutes ago, that I saw her with my own eyes.She called me crazy and hung up the phone. I did not understand. I was so scared I wanted to cry. Until the arrival of my brother, who finished at school, I was locked in my room, shaking with fear. I told him about my experience. To my surprise, he was not disturbed by this and told me that he also had a similar experience, but with  mother, and he also often hears father calling him, even if he is not at home at that time. My parents and sister thought I was just overworked from school. But I know that what I saw was not a hallucination. I saw it and it was real. Later, the same thing as my brother started to happen to me. At night I heard him calling my name. When I was alone at home, I heard footsteps and activity in the other rooms, despite the fact that no one was there. This has been going on since my experience with my sister.",

        "text": "I don't know where to ask this question, and I couldn't find anything related on the internet, so I'll just ask this here (thank god it's anonymous anyway);\nsometimes when I take mdma or smoke marijuana, it's like I get possessed by something, I start talking about myself in third person, and it feels like it's not me, after i sober up, i remember some of the things I said, but some not. I remember saying something like: \"I don't want to be here, I don't want to keep hurting her and destroying her life, but I can't stop because that's my job\".\n\nOne time I started shaking uncontrollably, my boyfriend tried to calm me down but I just couldn't stop. It's like I couldn't control my body and I couldn't say anything, even when I tried to, which never happened to me. I am always able to control myself when I'm high. It was like a blur, but I remember my boyfriend playing some kind of frequency (he knows about spirituality etc.) and it hurt like hell. I started rolling on the floor, screaming in pain and begging him to stop. After that I calmed down and started crying like a child. It was a horrible experience. This personality switch happened around 5 times, and it was scary each time because it felt like I'm sharing my body with someone else and I don't like it. \nTo be fair, ever since I was a kid, I always felt like there was something or someone telling me to ruin my life and make the worst decisions. I'm just wondering, could it maybe be some kind of disorder or could it be something else?",

During that time it was very hard physically and emotionally, and my uncle was progressively getting sicker. One evening I was helping my uncle, after that we were chilling and just talking to one another and all of the sudden we hear 3 knocks on the wall like right beside of us. My uncle and I have always believed in the paranormal and whatnot, but we haven't really experienced anything this blatant, we tried to tell my father but he was kind of skeptical of it. Eventually we just put this off, until we heard it again just me and my uncle. Finally, one evening me, my father, and my uncle were all chatting one night and we all three hear the same three knocks on the wall. After the last 3 knocks my uncle passed away not long after. I've been researching this and I am having trouble but I feel as if this was something letting us know my uncle's time on this earth was coming to an end. Has anyone had this experience or anything similar?",

In places they give spirits a lot of power. \n   One day I was talking good about shadow people and the Hat men. I had to got to the bathroom seen a child sized shrouded shadow person was standing still. I freaked and thought it was a intruder. Within that moment I flipped on the switch before my unblinking eyes it vanished. I try not to scream and keep my composure.",

Rather recently I started seeing my name in places; commercials, articles I was reading, social media. It really stuck out to me when it was on someone’s license plate. My name is not uncommon by any means, I just quite frankly haven’t seen it this often ever really. \n\nWell today my friend and I were dashing and we saw my name twice that day. It was one of the names of the customers (the first time I’ve gotten someone with the same name as me I might add) and one on the sign of a store noting they were the manager or whatever lol. \n\nNot only that but I have been followed by sirens and distant gunshot sounds for the past two days. I also have honestly been quite suicidal lately, and I’ve really been questioning the value of my life and the effect that would have on others.\n\nI got home tonight after experiencing all of that, went into one room to go get snacks and I could feel a sense of presence creep into existence behind me before it felt like a full fledged being staring at me. I stayed still staring at the food thinking surely there can’t be something there, there never is right? \n\nI turn around and for a split second I see a short being draped in some kind of cloth that was blacker than I was able to comprehend. A hood covered his head and his face looked like a mask, almost skeletal with piercing red eyes. \n\n\nThis makes me think back to a time a while back where I was visited by some kind of apparition. I was walking with a group, and a large grey cloud appeared about 10 feet above us. No one saw it but me. I kept walking. I felt like it was talking to me; I couldn’t understand what it was saying but I felt like it was important.",

        "text": "Hi Reddit -\n\nI'm not sure my post will even show up, since I'm mainly a lurker and don't comment very frequently, but we are starting to get a little creeped out and could use some advice. Apologies if this is the wrong sub!\n\nThis thanksgiving, my FIL was in the town that my BIL, my husband, and I live in to celebrate the holiday. He was staying with my BIL in his apartment. Early on the morning after thanksgiving, he collapsed in the hallway between my BIL's bedroom and bathroom. BIL called the paramedics, who worked on him for over a half hour before getting him to the ED, where doctors tried but could not restore a normal heart rhythm.  He passed away a little after 9:00 AM on 11/25/22.\n\nThe three of us travelled to FIL's hometown to complete the funeral arrangements. The first strange thing that happened was when I picked out a long sleeve shirt for him to be worn under the polo shirt BIL had picked out for him - we needed something long sleeved to wear under the polo to cover up the marks of therapy on his arms from the resuscitation attempts - and when I walked into the room to show my husband and BIL to see what they thought, the overhead lights started flickering like crazy.\n\nWe all just thought, hm. That's weird. The house is old-ish (built in the 50's or 60's, I think) so it could have easily been a coincidence.\n\nFast forward a few weeks later, and my husband and BIL returned to hometown to attend to the estate. When my husband returned from the trip, he remarked that he had a strange experience where he walked from the kitchen to the living room, into a cloud of aftershave scent out of nowhere. During the same visit, BIL reported that something knocked a framed photograph off of the dresser in the room he was sleeping in during the night. That room happened to be FIL's room.\n\nThese three things are weird, but the worrisome stuff is actually happening at BIL's apartment, where FIL collapsed.\n\nIt started about two weeks ago, with knocks on the bedroom wall above BIL's bed. He also reported that when he feeds his dog (that was FIL's dog and constant companion, who he kept) the lights flicker in the kitchen. This is notable because the apartment is barely a year old, and it is very small - the kitchen and living room lights are on the same circuit and they weren't flickering at all.\n\nThis week, BIL has heard groans in the hallway between the bedroom and bathroom where FIL collapsed, the drawer in his bedside table opened its own, his phone charger moved from the bedside table where he usually keeps it to the foot of his bed, and someone (something?)  has been moving the decorative rock (it is a college mascot themed rock, FIL was a crazy fan of this school's football team and had a LOT of school themed things) outside on his patio. \n\nThis started out with something happening once or twice a week, but the activity seems to be escalating.\n\nNow, I love to be spooked as much as anyone else, and there are no doubt a ton of rational explanations for most, if not all, of the things that are happening, especially considering that BIL lives in an apartment complex, and weird noises are definitely not uncommon.\n\nHowever, he is starting to get a bit freaked out, and the activity in his apartment coupled with the activity in FILs house makes me think that maybe something really might be going on. \n\nBIL and FIL had a good relationship, so I can't imagine that FIL's ghost is out to torment him, it just seems like he is trying to get attention, but it is starting to freak BIL TF out. Does anyone have any advice in this situation? Should BIL ignore the activity and hope it goes away eventually, should he get a priest (or similar) in to bless the apartment, or should he simply state out loud that he is starting to get freaked out and please knock it off? \n\nThank you, Reddit!\n\nTL; DR: FIL collapsed in BIL's apartment and now all kinds of weird things are happening. BIL is starting to freak out, any ideas on how to get it to stop?",

My grandma lives beside my uncle who has a fairly large family, i spent most of my time with one of my cousins that I'll. call Dan (not his real name, fairly close though.), and he and I were interested in creepypastas and the parnormal, we did a few challenges we knew of but the only one that worked was Charlie Charlie.\n\nTo this day I am fairly skeptical, i love ghost video compilations and the such and believe in the paranormal to an extent, but i'm not a full believer. I was always really curious about paranormal stuff. I was never allowed to dabble in it because of my parents which were religious, and I respect that lol\n\nAnyways, I was with my cousin and we were doing random challenges we heard of and using 'ghost hunting' apps on the phone and just having a good time, but we never really got anything. Keep in mind he was trying to scare me during these challenges so that he might've faked it but I even covered his mouth once which was the only way but I thought he could be faking it and did it, it still worked. I just brushed it off thinking it was the wind, and then we did it inside where there was no possible source of wind, and it still worked.\n\nWe just asked the game the standard questions, to be honest,  it still wasn't really eventful, nothing happened other than the pencil moving in response to the questions, and since it was so long ago I can't really remember what we asked or what I the response was.\n\nThe last question we asked was if he wanted to spend the night with us (for some reason, idk what we were thinking lol) on Sunday. We weren't able to spend the night together, me and my cousin, but strange stuff still happened when I tried to fall asleep on Sunday. It might have just been me scared at the thought that the Charlie Charlie ghost might've been there and my mind was making stuff up and just being acutely aware of every little thing, but most of what happened that freaked me out was stuff falling when it shouldn't have. Which was very minor, but it scared the crap out of me thinking that it might have been that ghost.\n\nIs there any possible explanation towards this? Anything?\n\nTLDR; I was with a cousin and did the charlie charlie game, I asked the game if they wanted to spend the night with us on Sunday and although we couldn't both spend the night together, it still felt like something was off.

I have some knowledge of witchcraft and other paranormal stuff but not enough to understand this. It is freaking me and him out.\n\nSo, it all started when one night he looked in his mirror and saw me. Just me. Everything looked like me. He felt like I was there. We have a very strong connection and feel safe with eachother. So I didn't think anything of it. Seeing me in that mirror made him feel safe and protected. Another time the entity even put a hand on his shoulder.\n\nBut last night it something changed. He knew it was me he saw in the mirror, or at least something that looks like me. But I was \"angry\". He couldn't see my eyes. \n\nHe can feel these things. He doesn't really realise that himself to be honest. Now at this moment he senses somethings there. A couple minutes ago he texted me his mirror made a sound. A creaking sound. \n\nSome background information. This mirror is old, and it is from a old castle. It used to face another mirror. As soon as I realised that I told him to take one of them down. A portal can else be created. He has the mirror covered up. He cleansed with some incense because he doesn't have anything else. Tomorrow I will try to cleanse the room completely and better.\n\nNow, do some of you know more? I've never heard of anything like this. It isn't uncommon to see things in a mirror. But how can he see me? I'm alive. It sounds stupid but I just don't get it. Is it another entity trying to be me? I know something is off.\n\nAny tips on how to cleanse the room? Or just any tips in general. \n\nThank you for reading all of this. If I'm incorrect in any way, please tell me. I am new in all of this. &lt;3",

While walking it sounded like a weary old man saying “excuse me” right behind me. I almost turned to look but something quickly told me not to. I kept walking and as I was about to open the door, I heard the noise the door makes as it opens before I pressed the door to open. As I got outside I didn’t feel like anything was behind me so I turn to look and the hallway was completely empty. I heard a door close but none of the office doors close before 5pm and they have to manually close. Idk what got in my office or how, but luckily I keep some tiger’s eye on me",

We were 3 teenagers roaming my tiny village of like 600 population. \n\nAt an intersection, we heard a shrill scream, like a classic horror movie scream. It sounded like it came from the end of the street, 3 houses away. We all looked at each other bewildered and the fear in each other's eyes was all the validation we needed to run. No words.\n\nWe sprinted a few blocks and ran inside my friend's house.  Right after locking the door and stepping away we heard something hit the door, HARD. Like somebody kicked or tackled the door. We just shit bricks and sat in the center of the living room until dawn and took bathroom breaks together. And that was it. We kept quiet and listened of course but there was nothing. \n\nIt really makes me wonder if it was human and something bad happened.",

        "text": "\nI'm not native, so I apologize for any mistakes. Have u ever seen something like this?\n\nCouple months ago, around 12 - 1am me and my friend got an idea to go for a walk to a nearby skatepark, which was in the middle of nowhere. Everywhere around it are woods, and no cars.\n\nOn our way to skatepark we didn't see anyone. And after a while of being there we got bored and decided to head home. While walking, we looked behind ourselves and noticed someone, something walking pretty far behind us and it seemed to be coming from the same place we were at (the skatepark). This thing was really bright, glowing white, it's head was just black and it didn't have a face (At first we just saw something glowing - white because it was far away, only later saw the details) It was walking very strangely. Looked like it was limping on one leg.\n\nAt first we thought It's a person but we wondered how did they get there because we were the only one there and there's no other way to get to the skatepark since everywhere are just woods and no houses.\nWe kept on walking and then this thing started weirdly RUNNING towards us, we got scared as hell and started running as well. We thought we might get robbed or some shit.\n\nAfter a while of running we didn't see it behind us anymore so we started walking. And... Then again we saw it. This time much, much closer to us and it seemed to appear there out of nowhere. So we run again, and the same thing happened it reappeared again after disappearing, each time closer.\n\nWe finally got home, closed all the blinds/curtains and turned on all the lights. At this point we were really, really scared.  ... We decided to look through the window If this thing is still there. My friend looked through the window, I was standing right next to him and he saw it. It was standing the closest to us than ever, right outside  our window. Maybe only 2m away. This thing was really bright white with whole black head and no face. It was just staring at us.\n\n\n\nBesides this encounter, we've never seen any other ghosts (?). We both only encountered ghosts in a way that we heard things before. Someone banging on the bathroom door, someone walking outside of the room we were in etc.",

        "text": "I'm am writing this with my friends as we share this experience.\n\nThis story takes place in the summer of 2022, me and my friend (who we will call Mona for this story) and their younger brother(who we will call Ethan ) were going home from our walk. I spotted a concrete wall covered by bushes and trees , with a closer look I realized it was a house , I pointed it out to my friends. Mona was surprised and Ethan gave a confused look. We walked up closer to the house which was on the side of the road , one of us suggested we go inside to take a look. This suggestion was quickly forgotten as we reminded ourselves it was late and we had to head back home.\n\nWe returned back the next day. The house looked less threatening, but we were still a bit scared to go inside. We took a small weapon for self defense, if we were at danger. We expected the house to be grafiti-ed  and destroyed as most abandoned buildings are. But it wasn't, the house was somehow intact, but the no signs of recent human life were present. It was fully furnished, but most furnishing was tipped/flipped over onto the ground. The ground was covered in dirty clothes, fallen objects, paper, etc. It was a small home, the corridor was narrow with rooms on each side and a staircase at the end. Inside the downstairs bedroom, there was a small table with a suitcase, inside were birthday cards, letters and some pills. The birthday cards were directed to a woman named Susan, who was at that time having her 80th birthday. The date on the card was 1998. The house felt eerie, I felt like I was being watched but at the same time, it was cool to see things from a different time period.\n\nIn the living room the television was flipped over on the floor along with the armchairs,we scavenged for valuables but found that every purse/bag or cupboard were emptied out.There was a shelf in the corner of the room where perfectly intact glass ornaments and holy trinkets were found,there was also expired oatmeal with raisins and cornstarch. In the kitchen which was found in the back of the house was completely destroyed,there were utensils, cups, pans ,bowls, plates etc... were shattered all over the floor. A gas tank was also in the room ( we don't know if it was full, but was probably empty ). What was strange was that there no counters but there was a stove/oven and fridge. The roof was almost collapsed and covered in weeds. Near the kitchen, there was the only bathroom  with a bath, sink, toilet and cabinet. I didn't go inside but my friend Mona did and they described it as : a white room covered in dirty white tiles, the toilet and bath were toppled over on the ground and a medical cabinet above the sink mirror. Inside the medical cabinet was only one singular glass baby bottle which was weird?? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe went upstairs where there were 3 bedrooms. One on each side of the corridor and another room above the front door. In the first bedroom, it was completely stripped of everything. ( clothes, jewelerry, etc... ) Since there was basically nothing inside, we left the room and went to the next. The other bedroom was a complete mess. Clothes, ornaments, trinkets, small statues, paintings and weirdly, kitchen utensils were scattered all over the bed and floor. There so many clothes that the ground was covered completely and it was hard to move around. ( Also I forgot to add but there was like a fireplace in almost every room? I don't know why maybe that was a popular thing back then? ) Just like in all the other rooms, the furnishings were tipped/flipped over. The last room we visited was a small room inside the messy bedroom. This room had many boxes of knitting kits, wool and yarn. Strangely again, there was kitchen utensils all over the ground. There was a vanity with makeup and more knitting equipment. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe took stuff out of the house for research purposes but we didn't get much information. We kept all the stuff in Mona's bedroom. Mona would often complain to me that : 1) the things we took had an awful stench 2) They felt that there was another presence in the room at all times while alone. 3) They heard whispers but couldn't make out any words 4) They had a constant anxious feeling and had several nightmares. I shared some of these experiences. I felt a presence near me most times and it affected my sleep schedule. Ethan on the other hand, luckily had none of this and felt fine. We put everything back around 2 weeks later. I will admit, going to that house, taking the stuff and keeping it, was a bad decision. I regret it so much because it affected me and my friend mentally and it keeps me up at night.  There is always something in my head begging to go back to that house and go inside, but I can't bring myself to do it. To me, it's like a strange paranormal pull, as if the past owners of the house want me to uncover a secret. We believe that there is something there, something we don't know of.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this\n\nHave a nice day!",

Don’t think he even knew my name to be honest haha. \n\nHowever one night around 11 years ago I had done everything I would do as usual in the evening, nothing out the ordinary… no drinking, no drug taking etc etc….. I was woken up in the middle of the night (can’t remember the time) to a glowing white to the right of my bed facing me. It had no distinct features from memory…. Maybe it had arms? Really not sure….. the whole experience lasted about 2-5 seconds and then I sort of snapped out of what i could only call a trance….. during this period I didn’t feel any fear or really anything to be honest…. And I just went back to sleep thinking yeah that was weird. \n\nThen, the next morning without giving any Information to anyone, I received a text message from my sister, my great grandad had died that night. I’ve never experienced anything similar since and my nan has died since.\n\nI just wonder if anyone has had a similar experience or could maybe shed some light on what this could have been? \n\nThank you.",

        "text": "Hi there r/Paranormal, new to this sub but none of my friends believe in ghosts so I came looking for people who do! I've always been a bit of a skeptic but a fair few things have happened lately that I just can't explain and have really confused me.\n\nIt seems that every time I visit my parents' house, I have odd experiences when they're not around and I'm home alone. Just to detail the few that stand out:\n\n\\- I heard a man walking in the hallway, with footsteps that sounded so real I went to check if my Dad had come home early. He had not and the door was locked. I went back into the lounge and heard the heavy steps again, a man's sigh, before the footsteps went towards my bedroom. Nobody was there. This happens every time I'm there alone and sometimes whatever it is bangs on my bedroom door, and mine only.\n\n\\-I was there one afternoon, sitting in the lounge, working on my laptop and listening to music. I ended up taking my earphones out, putting them in their case and putting the case to one side. Next I know, they're gone. I didn't move at all, they weren't on the table at my side anymore. I searched the whole house top to bottom because they're expensive and naturally, I was confused! I then went to check the lounge again. I found the case balancing on top of the TV, right in plain sight. I have absolutely no idea why my things moved from my desk to a TV some 20 feet away, or how they were put right on top of the TV screen. I have absolutely no explanation.\n\n\\-Nothing seemed to happen when I went home for Christmas-- not until my last night there. I left my room in the morning, closed it behind me while myself and my family went out for the day. I came home, went into my room, and things had been moved around. Photos I had **pinned** to the wall had been taken down, pins still in them, and placed neatly on my rug. They had obviously not fallen as they were some distance away from the wall, and the pins had not fallen out. This really spooked me as the house was empty all day and once again, it was happening in my room. It just felt so odd-- why my wall decor? Why is it always my room? Why the pictures of **my** family?\n\nI've never felt unsafe in the house. Sometimes I feel like I'm not alone there, that somebody else is there with me. It always happens to me when I visit. Lights turn on and off in my room, I continue to hear the footsteps when nobody else is around. I've gone back to my flat now the festive season is over, but these experiences have really stuck with me.\n\nI've been Googling, researching, and I don't know if it counts as residual haunting as whatever it is seems to be trying to interact with me. It always happens to me, in my room, or when I'm the only one to see it. Every encounter is different. I don't feel unsafe when I'm there and the activity always stops when I admit I'm freaked out. \n\nWhat do you guys think? Does this sound paranormal? Do you think something, or someone, is trying to get my attention? Thank you!!\n\nSincerely, a former skeptic who's really changed her mind!",
