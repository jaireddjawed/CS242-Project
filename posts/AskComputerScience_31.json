I applied as a CS major for freshman year, and I quickly realized that I'm just not as competitive as the average CS student to be able to succeed in the industry. I also found that I'm not Ã¼ber-passionate about the major. I gave it a shot and I just couldn't find it in me to continue.\n\nI also found pretty compelling reasons to pursue IT. First of all, I enjoyed my Business Information Systems quite a bit more than the programming courses I have taken. Secondly, I feel like I'm a people-person and am an extrovert that would fair much better in something like business analytics instead of as a SW dev. Not sure if these are compelling to you. Let me know your thoughts.\n\nBut what is the big push for a B.S. in CS? Is there something about IT that it's not worth pursuing?",

I already have a solid Windows desktop, so in my head I'm thinking that it's good to have access to both operating systems, but I also know that for 1300$, there are much more powerful options out there when compared to a MacBook Pro. So my question is: is it worth sticking with the MacBook in my situation? How important is it having access to both OSX and Windows (and even Linux I've heard?)? Thanks in advance! :-)\n\n**EDIT**: Bonus question. In general, what kind of specs should I be looking to prioritize in a build/laptop as a CS student?

Since I do not have much background in programming/algo/discrete maths, so I have picked up a few books on the subject. Here is my list:\n\n1. Introduction Programming in Java - Sedgrewick, Wayne\n2. Algorithms - Sedgewick, Wayne\n3. Concrete Maths - Knuth\n4. Discrete Maths - Chartrand\n5. Godel, Escher, Bach - Hofstadter (Just to get a feel for the fundamentals of intelligence)\n\nI have also registered for a few online courses so that I can work on some projects that can help me put together a CV for my grad school. But all the online courses seem to be geared toward the industry. Since I want some academic depth/level of understanding, thatâs why I have picked up these books.\n\nAny suggestion, on how to proceed and/or if my approach is sensible or not, will be much appreciated. \n\nAlso, can any tell me whether there are any (reddit) groups/forums that I can follow to regularly share my study plan and weekly findings with other members? I think it will help me stay motivated and share my understanding with like-minded people. If any of you are interested then let me know and we can maybe form a group.  \n(Cross posted in /r/algorithms)\n\nTIA!\n-Archie\n",

If my task graph were A -&gt; B, A -&gt; C, then I would not collapse these nodes together, because I want to be able to run B and C concurrently, which wouldn't be possible if I grouped it together with A.\n\nSome diagrams to illustrate this transformation:\n[Before Transformation](http://imgur.com/2JVpf7w)\n[After Transformation](http://imgur.com/VW45gh9)\n\nCollapsing linear nodes seems like a pretty useful transformation that has definitely been studied before. I can't seem to find the name for it though, can anyone help?",

        "text": "Hey guys. My girlfriend is considering a move to Texas to work as a software engineer at a \"top firm\". She's afraid that if she takes her first job out of college in Texas at our relatively lower salaries that it'll set her behind if she wants to move to California or Boston or NYC or wherever one might get more money up front. \n\nShe has a pressing offer in NY and Texas at the moment, and I'm in Texas so it's a difficult decision. We don't know for sure if she'd be able to negotiate reasonable offers out of state. \n\nAs an example, NY would be 85k before tax and Texas would be 65k before tax. After tax it's almost the same and after cost-of-living Texas is actually extremely ahead in terms of compensation. \n\nSo obviously cash while living in Texas wouldn't be a problem. One question that's hard to answer in our position is whether or not we would be set behind elsewhere if she accepts the 65k in Texas. We don't know if it's common for other companies to judge the difference when considering extending an offer down the line. \n\nTLDR; Has anyone here experienced a setback due to a previous before salary level, or do companies typically compensate/scale to match the differences? Due to city relocation. i.e. Texas vs NY/CA\n\nEDIT TO CONSIDER(GIRLFRIEND REQUEST): \n\"As an example, imagine Jack and Jane have the same qualifications and are applying for the same position in the Bay Area. Jack's from Texas and his current salary is lower. Jane's from NYC and her current salary is higher. If they both got the job in the Bay Area, would their salaries be about the same?\"",

For example, if I apply for a job that using a lot of machine learning and I took several classes related to it and can demonstrate competency in that subject, isn't that just as good? I don't expect to get hired off the back making loads of money but I'd be okay taking an entry level job and working my way up/proving myself. \n\nSo, if anybody has any experience with this, I'll appreciate all feedback.

        "text": "Hi, I'm new to Reddit and am looking for some advice. I'm currently an incoming sophomore in undergrad.\n\nI came a poor background and didn't really have STEM activities in high school. The summer before university, I took an online Python course and greatly enjoyed it. The people I met in my first months at university also interested me in pursuing CS.\n\nIn my second quarter in university, I heard about this professor who taught an amazing intermediate class for CS majors. Due to prerequisites and final exam conflicts, I could only audit it, but it was my favorite class of freshman year. I asked the professor what CS field has the most potential, and he suggested deep learning.\n\nBeing ambitious and a bit naive, I put much time into finding a research position. I wanted to craft a niche and seeing web dev was the rage and deep learning was discussed little amongst CS underclassmen, thought I could use deep learning to stand out. The people I talked to said machine learning, and deep learning especially, doesn't require much advanced math, so I dived in. Wrapping my head around the concepts was (and continues to be) very slow however, as I had to self-study linear algebra and still hasn't taken modeling, optimization, and advanced stats. I encountered many frustrations and headaches but continued to invest time on and off into it.\n\nIt has now been seven months since I started learning machine learning and two months into formal research (CNNs and GANs with TensorFlow). I got into a research program for students of disadvantaged backgrounds which provides extensive help in applying to graduate school. I'm also poised to transfer the CS major officially (from Biology) in Fall.\n\nI decided a few months ago that I wanted to work in and contribute as much as possible to AI research. My dream career would be working at Google. Not having much STEM in high school, I thought graduate school might be the best way to expand my problem solving skills and my best shot into Google, such as joining DeepMind with a PhD in CS. But with the vast majority of CS peers going into industry first, I'm not so sure. Machine learning is also much more popular than I initially thought but among upperclassmen, most of whom are also aiming for industry. I'm currently trying to do a bit along both paths, but I don't think that's sustainable the long term as I want to do well in classes and exercise too.\n\nIf I continue with the research route, I would be spending the next three years and summers doing mandatory research as part of the research program instead of side projects and internships. This would be in hope of getting into the CS programs of Stanford, Caltech, Berkeley, and MIT.\n\nThe industry route offers some financial security -- internships give above minimum wage and maybe even subsidized housing, and it may be tough affording grad school straight out of undergrad. Industry also offers more tangible and immediate results, as well as more social connections.\n\nMost of my current \"side projects\" consist of small contributions to my research projects, but I'm interested in and could make a back end project before interview season.\n\nMy counselors and peers all tell me I'm young, to keep doing different things and there is no best decision, but I would appreciate any advice.\n\nBecause it's been feeling like an off-and-on insomnia-inducing and concentration-sapping existential crisis over the last few months, haha.\n\n**TL;DR** I want to do AI research in the future and am currently involved in deep learning research, but haven't developed the math and problem solving maturity yet and feel very inefficient. On the other hand, the standard CS internships-and-industry route seems enticing, and I'm wondering if I should pursue that first.",

The classes are secure software development and assurance, computer communication networks, and databases. I've heard that being able to write secure code is a highly desired skill, but I'm not sure how it compares to the other skills. Computer communication networks covers network programming interfaces as well as multiple networking concepts. I feel like this is a fundamental but I'm not entirely sure. It should be noted that the professor is brand new and has never taught a course before. Many people have told me that databases is an absolute fundamental but I feel like this is the easiest skill to learn on my own as there are a lot of online resources for this. Any advice on which one to chose?\n",

I've taken discrete math and statistics courses but those are CS class.\n\nI'm thinking of linear algebra or even retaking statistics course from the Math program. Do you have any recommendation?\n\nEDIT: I'm a 3rd year computer science undergraduate, and interested in artificial intelligence/machine learning if that helps",
