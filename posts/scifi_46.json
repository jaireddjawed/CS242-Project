        "text": " November 29th, 2022\n\nI was wrong.  The second time the master alarm goes off and I’m no more composed than the first time.  This is helped by the fact that I’m on the dark side of the moon in radio shadow, so it is impossible for NASA to be running this as a test.\n\n“Oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god, no-no-no-no-no.”\n\nLike so much of space travel, this is one of those good news, bad news, situations.  Good news.  The LCD display was flashing red and wasn’t saying something totally incomprehensible.  It might have said “Error code: x92284022”.  It might have said “DSR - 5 Failure!”  And I’d have no bloody idea what was wrong.  “Radiation warning 130 𝝻Sv/hr“ was perfectly understandable.  \n\nBad news: Radiation Warning 130 𝝻Sv/hr.  I’m absolutely not going to get super powers from this.  \n\nNASA’s testing out these new radiation vests with this mission.  I was already wearing Moonikin’s, because I’d be an idiot not to.  But there are another two on sensor packages strapped into the Orion’s other seats.  Sorry NASA…  I take the vests off their sensor packages and put them on.  You know the old saying, “you can never have enough radiation shielding”.  \n\nI put the first vest on over top of the one I’m already wearing, doubling up protection.  And I was about to put the third one on over top of that when I got thinking.  I wrap the final vest around my waist like a skirt.\n\nWhile I’m doing that, I’m having a little mental debate: just how much radiation is this?  Earth’s magnetic field is an amazing radiation shield.  Inside the field’s protection (which extends up into the kinds of orbit’s the international space station and space shuttle fly at), you really don’t have to worry much about radiation.  Out by the moon you’re basically getting full buck of what the universe can throw at you.\n\nThat can range from “nuclear power plant worker”, to the scene in RoboCop where the bad guy falls into the pool of chemicals and melts.\n\nSo just how bad is this?  Do I have time for NASA to weigh in or do I need to do something now to try and save my life?\n\nSo, let’s see…  1 rad of radiation is enough radiation to raise the temperature of 1 liter of water by 1 degree Celsius in 1 minute.  Then just convert over to Sv using the left hand conversion rule…  I’m joking.  I have no bloody idea on any of this.  I know 3.6 roentgen is not great, not terrible.  But I have no idea what a roentgen is, what a Sv is, or how to convert between them.  \n\nBut there’s another way to do this.  NASA does have some worry warts, but if an alarm is going off then it’s an issue.  I could check the manual, figure out what the threshold amount is, and if I’m way over the line then it’s “I’m melting, melting, what a world, what a world,” time.  But that’s when I look back at the alarm.  30,000 𝝻Sv/hr and the last three digits are basically illegible because they’re whirring up.  \n\nWell that was easy.  I’m going to die.  Now, how to save my life?\n\nI need something that blocks radiation.  There’s not much stuff on Orion that I could use to build a shield, and I have no idea how good a radiation block a 1 kg test weight is.  Orion’s water tank is probably going to be the best radiation shield I could get.\n\nBack to the emergency procedures manual.  It takes a few minutes (and by the way, flipping through an index book while the clock on your life is ticking is a whole kind of fun), but eventually I figure out where the radiation sensor is mounted.  The next part is something NASA’s not going to be happy about.  I’m going to have to start flying the Orion.\n\nNow, I’m an engineer, not a pilot, and looking at the gimbles, or artificial horizons, or whatever the hell you call those balls with the sky and ground painted on them that airplanes and spaceships have, looking at those things and the control stick this feels very much like something a pilot should be doing.  Anyways, I strap myself in, and very gently pull the joystick back.  Nothing happens.  Ok, makes sense.  There’s probably an ‘on’ button I need to press first.  \n\nI give up, unstrap, and get the emergency procedures manual.  Fortunately for me, “orientation control failure” starts with just making sure you had set the system up right in the first place, and I follow along until I pull back on the control stick and Orion’s thrusters fire in response, the ship slowly starting to roll upwards.  \n\n“Fucking fucking fuck!” I slip out of the commander’s chair like a bar of soap off the edge of a tub.  Always buckle up.  I have to climb back into the seat which is all kinds of awkward and weird because of how it, and me, are rotating.  I buckle up.\n\nI’m watching two things, the artificial horizon, and the radiation meter, which is now up to 45,000 𝝻Sv/hr.  I complete a full spin without obvious effect on radiation readings.  I use another small jolt of thrust to stop the spin.  Then I push the control stick to the side and Orion starts a very, very, very, slow spin like a frisbee.  I stop it after about ten degrees, and again spin the ship end over end in a very slow tumble.  The first three spins are totally exhilarating and terrifying.  By the sixth, with the radiation meter doing nothing but rocket up, my brain is starting to wander.\n\nYou know…  Technically I am now actually commanding the Orion to do things…  Without permission…  In international waters…  \n\nSee, this is why engineers are a completely different breed from regular folk.  This is what my brain chooses to think about.  Or maybe it’s radiation sickness hitting already.\n\nI’m either a nerd, or suffering radiation poisoning.  Though the latter one is a very space pirate thing to suffer from.\n\nThe radiation meter hiccups, the 4, of 49,000 drops to a 1 then bounds back up.  I stop the spin, then very, very, very, slowly, bring Orion back.  The radiation meter drops down to 150 𝝻Sv/hr, and I stop the ship, right there, copying down my bearings.\n\nOk, situation: the radiation is now coming in, hitting Orion’s water tank, and the radiation sensor is in the shadow of the tank.  Even better, the water tank is blocking a ton of radiation.  I don’t know how good for me 150 𝝻Sv/hr is, but I do know it’s 99.7% better than 50,000 𝝻Sv/hr.   More importantly, I’ve got a vector for the radiation.  I need to get myself into that shadow.  A quick look at the emergency manual’s schematic of Orion, and I float myself very quickly to a spot about 18 inches from the summers.  Nope, I hate that.  I’m just going to call it a head.  \n\nIn theory this spot should be in the water tank’s radiation shadow.  \n\nNew problem.  Well new problems.  Problem 1) I’m too far away from Orion’s controls to use the radio or see what the radiation meter is saying.  I can’t just stay here forever, and I can’t really know when I can leave.  Problem 2) remember when I said I “stopped” Orion on this bearing?  That was a lie.  \n\nSee, without friction, there is no such thing as zero motion.  In space you’re always constantly twisting and turning on every axis.  Your speed could be 0.001 degrees per second, or so slowly that a bacterium would be asking you to get out of its way you slow-poke, but over a thousand seconds (or sixteen point six minutes) you’ve still rotated a degree.  Anyways, there’s no way I slowed to 0.001 degrees per second, Orion’s probably rotating at a couple of degrees every minute.  This little area of shadow I’ve made for myself is at best ten minutes away from being out of the shadow.\n\nWhat I need to do is figure out the heading to turn Orion onto in order to cast the water tank’s shadow onto the commander’s chair. \n\nI go to work in the margins of the emergency manual.  In space, radiation sources can just be thought of as a direction since everything’s so far away.  Basically, like an umbrella blocking the rain, the radiation sensor is now in the shadow of Orion’s most radiation blocking part.  Technically I’ve figured out a 3D vector for where the radiation is coming from.  Now I need to figure out the 3D vector between the water tank and the commander’s chair (which is where I’m going to need to be), and then how to rotate the Orion to bring those two vectors into alignment.\n\nThank god a degree in aerospace engineering is good for something.  Doesn’t even take ten minutes.  The radiation sensor goes back to being baked, but according to my math I’m in the shade.  For good measure I take off my two extra radiation vests and put them on the seat behind me - which is where the radiation is coming from.  That way I should have five layers of protection in addition to the water tank between my chest and the radiation source.  \n\nThere’s a problem to all this though - I’m not a good pilot and every few minutes I have to give Orion a nudge of thrusters to keep her where she needs to be.  I can’t keep that up indefinitely because I’m burning fuel.  \n\nSmall bit of pride.  A full ten minutes before I get the radio back up with NASA, I find a control panel button labeled “or - lock” and just like that, Orion’s computers are doing the flying again.\n\nSo I'm stuck, in the commanders seat, until I figure out how to fix a radiation storm.  I probably should have used the head when I had the chance.  Note to self.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nI’m Nathan H.

        "text": "Hey all - just a heads up in case anyone out there is like me and didn't realize the second book of Adrian Tchaikovsky's FINAL ARCHITECTURE series is actually out (released earlier this year). For some reason neither Audible or Amazon linked them in terms of being in the same series so I completely missed it. \n\nFor those that are new to Tchaikovsky's SciFi check out Children of Time and Children of Ruin, the third book of that trilogy to be released soon as well. Those 2 books are quite probably my favorite modern Sci Fi epics. Enjoy!",

These starships have huge magnetic fields which look like butterfly wings; and that these fields destroy the field around the planet which contains a hive-mind afterlife. This field was able to sometimes reincarnate humans or at least imbue them with qualities of artistic creativity. \nHence the planet which could not be approached had its afterlife field, destroyed elsewhere.\nAnyone recall that book?\nThanks.",

        "text": " November 28th, 2022 \n\nWith comms back up properly the flight surgeon has a look at my toes, and says they’ll probably be ok.  NASA spends six hours of horror making me re-enact everything that I did to try and “fix” things.  Horror?  Remember how I was telling you I could hear Mark cringe over the radio?  Yeah, he’s horrified at some of the buttons I decided to mash.  \n\nI’ve missed them.\n\nEventually though they’re down to having me measure how much duct tape is left on the roll, and I’m feeling like life’s getting back to normal.  It’s a bit like I just survived some kind of natural disaster and I’ve come home to a dad that can’t really relate, so all he says when he sees me is, “I’m so glad you’re safe - take out the garbage.”\n\nI love you too NASA.\n\n“Alex, this is Charlie,” the radio call comes in while I’m elbow deep in the toilet’s pluming, though at least it’s very clean plumbing.  Charlie’s got a really expressive voice actually, good radio voice.  I could tell when she was pissed the first time we talked, I could tell when she was thrilled when we got back in touch, and now I can tell she’s in a more business as usual mode.    \n\n“Hey Charlie.  How’s it going down there?”  What else do you say to your former boss’s boss’s boss?\n\n“Honestly Alex, it’s a complete circus.  We really would have preferred you not have told folks what was going on when you were trying to get in touch.  It’s kicked off a media storm down here.”\n\n“I’m surprised you hadn’t told everyone about me.  I mean wouldn’t they find out when I had a trial?”\n\n“The plan was to give you a choice when you got back.  A very loud trial with a very long sentence, or a silent plea bargain with a light sentence and the promise this all stays quiet. “\n\n“Magnanimous of NASA.”\n\n“Yeah, well that’s all off the table now.  But…”  she says, and I can see why radio procedure comes in handy, it would be nice if everyone had to say ‘over’ when they are done with a sentence.\n\nShe wasn’t done and continued.  “You’ve got a hell of a story right now Alex and we can turn this into a win-win.  You give some interviews, tell your tale, emphasize what a good job NASA is doing and what a good ship Orion is, and once you’re back maybe public opinion is so much in your favour, and NASA is so happy with how it all turned out in the end, a slap on the wrist is in the cards.”\n\n“Seriously?”  In retrospect I think that was the dumbest thing I’ve ever said in my life.  I am pretty sure it made me sound like a five-year-old who had been naughty, and it would have played out for the entire control room to hear.  \n\nOn the other hand, if you ever do something really cringy and feel terrible about yourself, just close your eyes and imagine a NASA control room.  Imagine that huge room filled with the world’s leading experts in their fields, professionals at the heights of their careers, and I guarantee they’ve all done far cringier things than whatever it was you just did.\n\nLong story short, I’m having a radio interview with Oprah.  Oh, and I’m not going to jail.  Probation, lots and lots of probation, but not jail - assuming Oprah likes me.\n\nFun story, true story, you know how long I had between “hey maybe it would be a good idea if you did an interview with Oprah, and if you do well you don’t go to jail,” and “hey Oprah, it’s great to meet you”?  Thirty-seven minutes.  \n\nMark gave me some good advice going into it though, or, rather he gave me some advice, and I’ll know how good or bad it is once I’m back.  “Just talk to her like you would a friend.  Be honest, be yourself, don’t worry about making her or her audience like you.  Just let them see who you are.  People like authenticity and there’s no time to polish you up or focus group what you’re saying, so don’t even try.”\n\nAnyways, Oprah, nice lady.  Mostly it was just retelling the story backwards.  How I saved Artemis I, then how I snuck onboard.  Then the conversation turned to why I snuck onboard.\n\n“You had a pretty recent breakup, didn’t you?” Oprah asked.  She has a remarkably soft voice.  Is that why she’s so famous?  She asks these personal questions and it kind of feels like you’re sitting in the office of a guidance counselor who just wants what’s best for you.\n\n“Yeah.  But I didn’t do this to win Jess back if that’s what you mean.”  And that was true.  But if she happened to come to see me in a different light, and if that light happened to show her why my weird personality quirks were actually admirable skills, and if that revelation made her want to get back together…  \n\n“I was wondering how the breakup changed your outlook,” she said.\n\nI probably should have prepared for this.  Honestly when I imagined monologuing about what I’d done it was always to a judge and jury, never to the press.  The truth?  When you love someone, think they’re amazing, want to go see the world with them and have little babies you can dress up as Tesla and Edison…  Well, you really want that person to feel the same way about you, to admire you like you admire them.  And when, instead, they dump you… they don’t even like you…  That sucks in all kinds of ways.  \n\nAre you actually worthless?  I mean hey you also just got that form rejection letter from NASA telling you that you’re not good enough for your childhood dream.  Sure, a degree in aerospace engineering isn’t nothing, but that just means I’m good at math, society’s least sexy and valued skill.  I mean seriously if you were playing the video game of life and you could be good at anything, “math” would be a stupid skill tree to select.  \n\nI know what you’re thinking, ‘whatever you say to Oprah, don’t say that stuff.’  I said that stuff.  \n\n“It sounds a bit like you feel you were in the wrong place.  Do you feel like you’re in the right one now?”\n\n“I just saw this empty seat on Artemis I and couldn’t stand the idea of everything I’d always wanted just being… an empty seat that no one was going to take.”\n\n“You’ve broken some laws doing this.”\n\n“Yeah.  I didn’t actually stop to figure out which laws exactly, or what the punishment was.  But like… it’s obviously got to be all kinds of illegal to do this.”\n\n“What do you think should happen to you when you get back?” Oprah asked.\n\nI really wish I had a PR person.  What’s the answer to that?  When in doubt, go with the truth.\n\n“Same thing as I think should happen to everyone else who breaks a law.  You look at the harm caused, the need to make sure the victims feel vindicated, the need to deter other people from doing what I did or some variation of it, what it would take to stop me from doing this again, and whether I’m a danger to society and need to be isolated.  Mix that stuff all together and figure out how long I should be in jail.”\n\n“It sounds like you’re saying you shouldn’t be in jail very long,” Oprah said and, there’s this ambiguity in her tone.  I have no idea what she thinks.  Is she amused?  Is she testing?  Is she just putting it out there because I dodged the question.\n\n“I don’t think I’m an evil person…  Just naughty.”\n\nNASA didn’t feel like telling me how they thought I did.  So I had a Skor bar and when I closed my eyes to sleep, I thanked god that the interview wasn’t playing back in my mind as a horror reel.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI’m Nathan H. Green, a science-fiction writer with a degree in aerospace engineering, and I’m going to be doing daily semi-fictional stories tracking the Artemis I mission.

I wanted something new, refreshing, and more \"optimistic\". I then searched YouTube for a playthrough and this was the first result.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINdtTcvO-4\n\nI was amazed by what I saw. It was unlike any game I have seen.\n\nAfter that I rushed to GameStop and managed to get a copy for $20 bucks.\n\nI remember failing hard at first become I didn't know how to play RPGs. I was going into areas with higher level enemies than my character. It made a quit the game for a small time but I went back and was determined to learn how to play the game because I loved the characters, story, and universe I was introduced to.\n\nI ended up picking up the rest of the trilogy and the DLC.\n\nBefore that I was not interested in anything space or sci fi. I ended up searching for more experiences like that. I picked up some books of \"The Expanse\". I also bought a telescope and went stargazing throughout the Summer of 2014. I binge watch Babylon 5 and BSG.\n\nI wondered why there wasn't any shows with space travel in them. Turns out I wasn't alone. .\n\nhttps://practicalfreespirit.com/2011/09/06/to-infinity-and-beyond/\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20141202022030/http://io9.com/5837047/why-we-need-more-space-adventures\n\nHow would you reacted if back in 2014 a person told you they lamented there wasn't anything on TV with space travel in it?\n\nWhat happened?\n\nDid the wars in the Middle East and Financial Crisis of 2008 kill optimism for the future?\n\nWas it the retirement of the space shuttle and nothing big happening in the world of space exploration?\n\nDid we become too materialistic, as evidenced by the popularity of reality TV?\n\nWere stuff with FTL starships, aliens, and laser guns seen as childish?\n\nWere people too enchanted by \"Superheroes\", \"Game of Thrones\", and zombies? Loved GOT btw! But it would have been cool if people were more excited for space and the future.\n\nThe Expanse was top class but had a very small fanbase.\n\nWe are living in darker times. I remember back in 2012-2014 being so excited for humanity's future. I don't imagine anyone flocking to a fictional version of humanity's future that is optimistic.\n\nBut I hope someday there is something on TV set in space that is not Wars or Trek that people go crazy over.",

In blade runner, the androids talk about all the adventures they had and what it means to be alive. Or even “machine race” where they are collective and self replicating. The stories are always peripheral in the books or media I’ve come across. Never the main focal point. There’s a lot of humanity to be mind from these stories",

He hiked up his comforter around him, blocking off the fuzzy view of the rest of the massive cleansing room provided for human use. The catch basin really should not be that color, he finally decided, feeling a bit proud of himself for forcing the thought up through layers of sleep deprivation. A stray thought thread suggested that he really should have petitioned the central university for this sector for that assistant when he had the chance, but the blood-berries had been blooming in the south slopes and none of the preservation techniques this base had access to would have preserved the protein structures quite right.\n\nQuilx’tch brushed the pad of one paw over his primary eyes to dismiss the stray wisps of thought.\n\n“I’m getting as bad as Human Friend Scotty,” he said ruefully.\n\nAnother stray thought tried to lead him down the path of wondering if human behavior contain was playing a role in his current state.\n\n“It was not as if my University time showed much better behavior,” he clicked to himself idly.\n\nBloodberries. Yes, the humans called them that because their eyes showed the glittering orbs as a single color. They claimed it was the same color as their primary circulatory fluid. Now, Quilx’tch wondered why he was thinking of that as he stared down at the discolored catch basin.\n\nThe material for the catch basin had been harvested from the local rocks. Human Friend Scotty had eagerly explained the process.\n\n“We used to have to carve things like this out of larger chunks of rock,” the human had said. “Now we just grind up the fragments til we get the size we want and then we micro-compress them into shape. Folks like it because it looks like rough granite, smooth with shiny bits inside”\n\nQuilx’tch now stared at the shiny bits visible under the coating of fluid.\n\n“I think,” Quilx’tch said to himself, feeling a bit uneasy. “The humans would also call that blood red.”\n\nHe pondered what the substance might be as he walked across the edge of the cold catch basin to gather up his grooming brush and chelicerae pick. He gently pushed the comforter back, letting the harsh cleansing room light sting his secondary eyes as he gently brushed out his hairs. He found his gaze repeated drawn back to the layer of bio-matter, or at least he thought it was bio-matter, in the catch basin. Usually Human Friend Scotty was quite careful about cleaning up after himself. So it might not be biomatter after all. Though Quilx’tch couldn’t imagine what Human Friend Scotty would have been doing this early in the morning in the cleansing room. His grooming finished he gathered up his comforter and trotted out to the main sleeping area, massive to his scale, but seeming quite filled by the mass of the human who was currently wriggling into his day clothes.\n\nQuilx’tch scampered over the spider-walk along the wall and tucked his comforter back into his hammock while Human Friend Scotty arranged his protective outer layers against his hairless skin. That task seemingly complete the human reached down for his foot armor and proceed with a Trisk-check. Quilx’tch couldn’t help chuckling anew at that. Why the humans were, to a person, convinced that his kind liked to  hide in there foot armor was a mystery, but one that provided far too much amusement on distant base to be probed into too abruptly. That final ceremony over Human Friend Scotty set his binocular vision sniping around the room to locate him.\n\nQuilx’tch waved to catch the humans attention.\n\n“Tiny spider friend on his bunk,” the human stated in the dim but satisfied tone of one fulfilling a checklist.\n\n“Human Friend Scotty,” Quilx’tch interjected.\n\nHe knew that if he did not catch the human’s attention quickly at this time of day nothing would keep the human from bolting for the coffee that was brewing in the cafeteria once Human Friend Scotty had located him.\n\nNow the human visible paused in his preparation to lumber out the door of their room.\n\n“What’s up little guy?” the human asked, fighting back a yawn.\n\n“Why is the catch basin in the cleansing room the color of bloodberries?” Quilx’tch asked.\n\nHuman Friend Scotty blinked slowly as he processed the question. Then his face flexed and his chin lifted with a grin as he clearly parsed the answer.\n\n“I forgot to rinse out the sink after brushing my teeth this morning!” he said. “Sorry bud!”\n\nThe human turned swiftly and went into the cleansing room, which soon emitted the sounds of rushing water. The human came out still grinning.\n\n“All clean!” He declared. “Won’t happen again!”\n\n“Thank you,” Quilx’tch said, feeling distinctly uneasy now.  “However that was not my question.”\n\n“Thecolor?” Human Friend Scotty asked in surprise. “That was just my blood.”\n\nThe human stared at him with expectancy as he waited the polite six seconds to reply. Quilx’tch felt himself “puffing up” as the humans called it and Human Friend Scotty’s expression rapidly morphed form expectant to concerned.\n\n“Why,” Quilx’tch asked carefully, “were you bleeding into the catch basin this morning as you cleaned your teeth.”\n\nHuman Friend Scotty’s face lit up with in the way that Quilx’tch was beginning to understand meant the human had an easy answer to a question.\n\n“You remember I accidentally broke my sonic cleaner?” he asked.\n\nQuilx’tch replied in the affirmative. Watching the human first fumble and drop the item on the floor. Then kick it into the far wall, only to finally step on it, damaging both the device and his foot in the process had been very educational on the value of the spider walks the humans insisted on installing in jointly occupied bases.\n\n“And I told you that I would be switching to the old fashioned method of teeth cleaning?” Human Friend Scotty went on.\n\n“Mechanical friction and chemical layering with a brush applicator,” Quilx’tch replied, bobbing his head in a yes gesture.\n\n“Well, you always bleed a little when you switch back,” Human Friend Scotty said with a dismissive wave of his hand. “Sorry I forgot to warn you about it, and sorry I forgot to clean my blood out of the sink after.”\n\nHuman Friend Scotty seemed to consider this revelation the end of the conversation and without waiting so much as a second for a response turned and left the room, presumably in search of coffee. Quilx’tch paused, waiting for him to come back and explain...something...anything more about the situation. But the door of their room stayed stubbornly closed.\n\nQuilx’tch took a deep breath and ran his paws over his primary eyes.\n\n“Right,” he said to the empty air. “First I will speak to the base medic. Then breakfast.”\n\n## [Amazon (Kindle, Paperback, Audiobook)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09NN2PM8D?binding=paperback&amp;ref=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_pc_tpbk)\n\n## [Barnes &amp; Nobel (Nook, Paperback, Audiobook)](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/%22Humans+are+Weird%22?Ntk=P_Series_Title&amp;Ns=P_Series_Number&amp;Ntx=mode+matchall)\n\n## [Kobo by Rakuten (ebook and Audiobook)](https://www.kobo.com/us/en/search?query=Humans%20are%20Weird&amp;fcsearchfield=Series&amp;seriesId=a035ce04-e582-5fcc-b327-16c68ca4b418&amp;fcshowpointsprice=no&amp;fcmaxprice=5&amp;fcminprice=0&amp;id=1561e6f7-742f-4c1b-a804-187728814574)\n\n## [Google Play Books (ebook and Audiobook)](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Humans_are_Weird_I_Have_the_Data?id=7_wdEAAAQBAJ&amp;gl=US)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/1pj909dr5e2a1.gif",

It turns out- war! Because this\n\nis a special child. A prophet child. Someone she knows all too well. He was meant for great things before he got kidnapped by an anti-Prophet\n\ncult that keeps abusing him to summon the evil and mysterious Chaos. Her dreams influence the empire- and war with the earth and humans\n\nwill happen if they can't or simply won't rescue him.\n\nIn 2019 there was an incident on the earth more famous than Roswell. It was known as the \"The Neumann Encounter\" although its real name is the\n\n\"The Neumann-Earth War.\" This is the story of when the Neumann are known by most to landed on- and waged war- against the earth. This is the\n\nstory of the Neumann Encounter and the permanent effect on the humans.\n\nCHAPTER ONE- \"IN THE BEGINNING....\"\n\nHumans didn't evolve alone in this universe. On 99 other planets, for a total of 100, humans evolved in conjunction with other races. One of\n\nthose races is known as the Neumann. About a foot taller with bodies and faces similar to humans (they hate hearing that) and long ears (they\n\ndon't want to be called \"Elves\" or be compared to them) they formed the largest empire in space. They were the first to evolve and evolved the\n\nfastest. As their psychics were fond of telling earth's psychics, they evolved the fastest and thus were the smartest. Humans evolved\n\nslowly but not the slowest, yet only had an empire of one planet.\n\nThere was a problem though- the earth was unwilling to unlock the psychic gene. It enabled those who did to communicate with mysterious beings\n\nfrom the afterlife- though only a small elite number of psychics could, no matter the alien race. Why wouldn't the stubborn earth just open the\n\npsychic gene? It was a questioned most had forgotten about. Earth's religions would evolve to be so happier and more tolerant with the psychic\n\ngene- and their technology would advance exponentially! It was a mystery none could ever decipher. The most popular theory was simply that\n\nthose who were psychics automatically earned and advanced more- with no competition! The psychics didn't fight or hate each much during all but\n\nthe worst of wars. They usually got along because, come plague of famine, they'd have gold and food and water aplenty. That's what Europeans\n\ncommonly said during the Middle Ages.\n\nThe psychic gene is nothing to be afraid of- it's a natural evolution that grows with exposure to the kind but mysterious Light. Though darker\n\nones, especially on the earth, would go with the merciless but mysterious Chaos. Neumann don't like to discuss the Chaos so that's a story for\n\nanother chapter.\n\nInside of an ornate, well-designed castle designed to make people smile and exhibit the nearly endless wealth of the Royal Holy family of the\n\nNeumann was a Queen known as Queen Karen. Indescribably beautiful for it's numerous well-crafted rugs and chandeliers and armor and antiques\n\nand beautiful silver (most Neumann prefered silver) and a staff of several thousand, it never failed to impress. It was part of a property for a\n\ndistance of about what 10,000 square miles are to the Neumann. It lay in the center of the capital in the wealthiest district of Royal Holy City\n\nGrandia on their Capital Planet of Planet Light.\n\nThe Neumann all lived for up to nearly 510 years of age. It gave them much time to acquire wisdom and ensure the leaders could make wiser\n\ndecisions. The shorter-life spanned aliens who didn't like their long age would simply say they evolved cleverness instead to achieve\n\nlasting legacy in shorter time without wasting time.\n\nThe Holy Neumann Empire had problems though- because several decades ago, it had lost a war against a rival alien race. Throughout it their Holy\n\nQueen suffered nightmares and droughts and famines were common throughout the Empire. The people said she simply needed to cure her nightmares-\n\nthough none of the seers where they originated from.\n\nShe always wore the finest outfits- with a preference for white- and wore gold crowns covered in priceless rubies with gold feather-like designs\n\nshaped like the most sacred of their animals on their most sacred planet. She was about 6'5 and had blue hair and blue eyes and was said to be\n\nof immeasurable beauty. Many Neumann men and women sought her out for marriage- and though she dated, she stayed single. She needed to find a\n\nway to address her nightmares before her health would improve. She was having a bad dream as she slept....\n\nA man covered in black and covered in shadows spoke to a young, thin man with dark hair and green eyes who was approximately 17 years of age.\n\n\"You stupid child of Holiness, of Light, of High Royal Blood. You stupid prophet. YOU WILL DIE!\"\n\nChild- \"NOOOOOOO!\" Before he could be harmed, she always woke up.\n\nQueen Karen- \"AGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!\" Neumann attendants arrived immediately.\n\nAttendant 1- \"What's wrong?\n\nAttendant 2- \"Shall we summon a doctor again?\"\n\nQueen Karen- \"I can't stand it.... these nightmares plague me. Someone from Houston keeps being abused by terrorists- on the earth! I don't\n\nknow who but my seers say it be a young man nearing 20- but he'll die by then. Can you find him? I finally got a lead- Houston!\"\n\nNeuman Guard- \"Yes! We'll investigate immediately and contact the earth and-\"\n\nQueen Karen- \"No... I.... I..... I need more rest. Summon a general\" A hologram appeared before her. The speaker was granted Royal permission\n\nto address her. He was a large, muscular Neumann fond of cigars, alcohol and men.\n\nNeumann General- \"Fuck it. We're invading. We invade, we'll rescue all prophets in Houston being abused till we get! That stupid backwater\n\nplanet- their psychic genes are barely active! This war will be fast and easy no matter what!\"\n\nCHAPTER TWO- \"EARTH POLITICS\"\n\n10,000 ships approached the earth- a small portion of the Neumann Navy. A message via hologram was being tranferred to all hologram viewing areas on all\n\nships.\n\nNeumann General- \"ALRIGHT, LISTEN UP ALL YOU SOLDIERS! WE'RE INVADING- SOON! WE'RE GOING TO HOUSTON TO RESCUE EVERY PROPHET WHO HAS BEEN ABUSED AND ACCUSED\n\nOF CRIMES THEY NEVER COMMIT-\"\n\n?- \"Greetings.\"\n\n\"Neumann General- \"YOU!\" It was a thin, mean, older man wearing a five star outfit. He was sitting in a large chair with other generals at the Pentagon.\n\n?- \"Yeah. Call me General Richards. You're all about to die. Our ships will wipe you out.\" All the Neumann soldiers screamed in rage at the General.\n\n\"FUCK YOU, FUCK YOU, ASSHOLE, ASSHOLE, DUMBASS, FUCKING ASSHOLE!\"\n\nNeumann General- \"That ain't your name your dumb weenie it-\"\n\nPentagon General- \"It don't matter. We have the powers of Chaos. We've cultivated it for a long time. Nice ships- we'll take em! CHAOS, CHAOS, CHAOS!\n\nWE'RE SUMMONING YOU AND THE CHAOSLINGS TO ATTACK THEIR SHIPS!\"\n\nNeumann General- \"THAT- AIN'T- LEGAL!\" Another general spoke.\n\nPentagon General 2- \"We actually passed laws that make it legal everywhere across all space for us to defend ourselves legally through the usage-\"\n\nNeumann Soldier- \"Fuck you! Like those anti-prophet laws?! They're offensive to the Light!\"\n\nPentagon 2- \"Yeah.... well.... sucks to be them. They don't have rights anymore on this planet you fuckers. Best focus on the battles.\"\n\nWithin minutes the mysterious Chaoslings attacked with a malevolent force known as Chaos. It used up considerable energies but after several minutes\n\nHALT IT'S THE PENTAGON! WE WON THE BATTLE YOU DAMN HISTORIAN! CENSOR IT! DISREGARD CHAOS, WE FIGHT GOOD AND MORAL BATTLES WITH GOOD AND MORAL TACTICS!\n\n..... all the ships were destroyed including those escaping. It was considered bad form to-\n\nHAHAHA! IT WAS DONE LEGALLY WITH OUR NEWLY PASSED ANTI-ESPIONAGE LAWS YOU DAMNED IDIOTS! HAHAHA!\n\nCHAPTER 3- \"OUTRAGE\"\n\nOn Planet Calm there was much outrage over what was happening. The Empire spanned over 10,000,000 planets. Earth had just one, though was notoriously\n\npowerful. The second smallest had over half a million, but was rarely bothered for it's extreme military might always seemed to win or stalemate every war.\n\nPeople were rioting and discontent was at an all-time high.\n\nNewcaster \"AND ALL THE SHIPS WERE SUNK DUE TO THE NEWLY LEGALIZED ABUSE OF CHAOS POWERS BY THE-\"\n\nNeuman protesters- \"BOOOOOO! YOU SUCK, YOU SUCK, AVENGE EM! IT'S ONE DAMN PLANET WE WANT OUR FUCKING SHIPS BACK, BOOOO, BOOOO!\"\n\nMeanwhile, at a secret conference, the High Royal Families gathered to discuss the war.\n\nNeumann Seer- \"It's called secret for a reason, wink. Try the military conference.\"\n\nUmmm.... meanwhile.... \"You know us aliens? we're spying on him while you the historian writes. We actually don't fucking care because this will just be\n\ncensored later if we feel like it. He'll censor anything we want. So far we don't really give much of a fuck. Do continue, this amuses us. If you're reading\n\nthis before it's censored, it's probably for some weird reason or something.\"\n\nMeanwhile at a secret conference, the Neumann military gathered with the military leaders of their colonies who came from every race. Literally!\n\nThere were even some humans- but this is true of all empires across space except the earth, so it isn't really as a big a deal as you might think.\n\nThe humans there were quiet and uncomfortable. Though loyal, many gave them nasty looks. This book will focus on the Neumann but the colony\n\nmilitaries contributed one fourth as much militarily as did the Neumann. The Generals don't care to be identified.\n\n?- \"What do we do? What? Those ships were elite- it's an outrage, an outrage!\"\n\n?- \"This is something that needs to be avenged!\"\n\n?- \"How can we?\"\n\n?- \"Karen can be fine once the young man is saved from the earth. Nobody there wants him rescued- I don't know why they hate prophets so much\n\nall of a sudden.\"\n\n\"We gotta do it. It'll be an outright war, full resources, immediately waged. It'll be brief and highly succesful! We'll rescue all the\n\nprophets and save them from abuse by the earth.\"\n\nCHAPTER FOUR- \"THE INVASION!\"\n\nSuddenly, all newcasters broadcast a message- directly from Queen Karen of the Neumann Empire.\n\nQueen Karen- \"Greetings, earth. We come in peace. We're here to rescue all prophets being held in captivity from abuse by the U.S. government\n\nand her\"\n\n\"HIS\"\n\n\"allies. Just let them go and we won't bother sinking a single ship or killing a single soldier. It's very easy.\"\n\nThe Pope showed up, infuriated.\n\nPope- \"BULLSHIT, BULLSHIT, BULLSHIT YOU.... GRR..... THEY WANT TO INVADE AND TAKE OUR RESOURCES, WE WILL NOT PERMIT THIS! BY GOD, ALL\n\nRELIGIONS CALL FOR A CRUSADE AGAINST THE ALIENS AND TO WIPE THEM OUT! THERE ARE FEW PROPHETS AND IT'S OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE, WHO ARE THEY?\n\nWHAT'D THEY EVER DO? DID THEY BUILD THE STATUE OF LIBERTY? THE EIFFEL TOWER? OR CREATE OUR SKYSCRAPERS? NO?! THEY NEED TO JUST DIE DIE DIE!\"\n\n\"You ill-mannered simpleton! They need to be rescued! This war is an excuse to abuse prophets to summon more Chaos to this darkened world! The prophets\n\nare a wonderful, beautiful thing who are a part of the natural order of things. IT IS UNNATURAL AND EVIL TO HATE THEM.\"\n\nPope- \"....\"\n\nThe Light is what we Neumann worship, not the Chaos! Light is good and Chaos is evil. Light spreads happiness and evil spreads-\"\n\nPope- \"....\"\n\nQueen Karen- \"It's unspeakable.\" She cried. \"The earth's leaders promised me I could deliver the address live.\"\n\nJapanese woman- \"We Japanese are curious. Just show the message in Japan- we're curious what the alien Goddess has to say. Just please don't\n\nharm Shintoism or Buddhism or our beliefs.\" Karen cried.\n\nQueen Karen- \"Thank you. I'm not here to harm your religions- any of them. People have a right to their beliefs but not to go out and harm the\n\nHoly and Sacred prophets. I will speak only to the Japanese and you'll have to hear this later. Pope, you have no manners, good day good sir.\"\n\nPope- \"Bah!\"\n\nJapanese man- \"Great, we want to hear! We want to hear!\"\n\nFor one hour and ten minutes, Karen spoke to Japan. There was little controversy- and its rulers seemed concerned about the dangers of the Chaos\n\nand the Chaoslings, and about the mysterious psychic gene that would uplift them to the stars above and give them an empire in space if they would\n\nonly let it open in all of them.\n\nCHAPTER INVASION- \"THE INVASION PART FIVE\"\n\nYou know the Neumann leaders need to just fucking censor this part. AND HOW THE AMERICANS AND THE REST OF THE EARTH SAY! Just.... no.\n\nThe war's a stalemate. The humans are indescribably powerful and dangerous to fight and have an almost unlimited amount of Chaos- and Chaosling\n\nallies. After two years, 1/3 of the earth's population were gone, drafted under heavily militarized states. Only Japan didn't fight- within an\n\nunknown amount of time, they turned over the abused prophets of Japan for concessions and permitted an embassy and trade with the Neumann. The\n\nrest is a secret they do want shared.\n\nCHAPTER SIX- \"AND THEN THERE WAS DARKNESS\"\n\nWhat is Chaos? It's a power the opposite of Light and-\n\n\"NEUMANN CENSORS WARN THE SCRIBER NOT TO TEMPT READERS WITH THE POWERS OF CHAOS. IT IS AN EVIL POWER THAT SPREADS HATRED, ANGER, BIGOTRY AND\n\nDESTRUCTION EVERYWHERE. IT CREATES NOT LIFE BUT \"CHAOSLINGS\" A RACE SEEN ONLY BY THOSE WITH THEIR PSYCHIC GENES ACTIVE. On the earth-\"\n\n\"AND THE CHAOS SAYS LEAVE IT A MYSTERY TO BE DECIPHERED. ONLY THE TRUE FAITHFUL ARE MEANT TO KNOW IT!\"\n\n\"NEUMANN SAY BEGONE!\"\n\n\"BAH!\"\n\nFINAL CHAPTER\n\nThe Neumann Empire might be the largest, but that small planet the earth hid many secrets. Nearly all of its top leaders secretly worshipped\n\nChaos and encouraged and spread its growth exponentially across the earth. The Pope just wouldn't convert- no matter what.\n\nPope- \"Karenism will NOT spread to this earth! The war will be won! The faithful will realize Chaos is nothing to fear but merely as aspect of\n\nGod that enables us to win against those vile aliens! We will triumph in the end because half the Neumann Navies are gone- and armies are gone.\n\nWe-\"\n\nHe spoke above Vatican City to the large, angry crowd below. Many people had awoken their psychic genes- and they kept disappearing to the Secret\n\nEarth Psychic Services Police. People were angry.\n\nAngry Italian man- \"FUCKER! THEY WIPED OUT MOST EARTH ARMIES YOU JERK!\"\n\nAngry Italian woman- \"WHY DOES EVERYONE WHO BECOMES A PSYCHIC WIND UP DEAD AND NEVER GET HEARD FROM?!\"\n\nJapanese man- \"ONLY JAPAN EMBRACES KARENISM, IT IS COMPATIBLE WITH SHINTOISM IT IS-\"\n\nPope- \"BLASPHEMY! THAT STUPID MAN IS TO-\"\n\nKaren- \"NOT BE HARMED!\"\n\nA Holygram- a special hologram delivering the holiest of all messages- appeared above the crowd showing Karen dressed as her ceremonial role, the\n\nGrand Exalted High Priestess of Light.\n\nPope- \"What do you want? Its over! You lost! The psychic gene is blasphemy!\"\n\nKaren- \"THEN THE LIGHT WILL SPREAD AND OPEN UP -ALL- PSYCHIC GENES! AND THE PEOPLE CAN DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES! BEHOLD!\"\n\nSuddenly, the entire Neumann population began praying for the Light to spread. Queen Karen raised her arms and hands in front of her in two large\n\ncircles for a minute- and then everyone on the earth saw Light for a second.\n\nKaren- \"WE'RE LEAVING! THE EARTH SICKENS ME! WE WILL SELL OUR TECHNOLOGY ONLY TO THE JAPANESE AND NOBODY ELSE.\"\n\nJapanese woman- \"DON'T LEAVE! HOW CAN WE FIND YOU! ARE YOU GOD!\"\n\nKaren- \"To many, yes. Our beliefs won't change or be censored no matter the earth demands. Just build a ship and find us- but your real enemy is\n\nChaos. Until this earth defeats it, all alien races confine you here until you win the war against Chaos. Only Japan will be assisted!\n\nNEUMANN- RETREAT WE HAVE LOST! WE RETURN HOME!\"\n\nCrowd- \"HUZZAH! HUZZAH! HUZZAH ITALY HUZZ-\"\n\nThey grew quiet and afraid because they could see the spiritual world. Yu Yu Hakusho? Bleach? Stories of ghosts? Stories of demons like in Inuyasha?\n\nThere were countless monsters that could be seen. Riots everywhere started across the earth of the population against the monsters. All televisions broadcast\n\nthe Neumann military leader- because Karen fainted from exhaustion!\n\nHigh General- \"We're leaving to take Karen back to Planet Light for medical attention. We will assist only Japan for one year and leave. Beware-\n\nthese powers are a blessing.... and a curse. Because you're not ready for them. But it was the only way to keep Chaos from spreading where it's\n\nhidden so long with you. No race will EVER hide the psychic gene again!\"\n\nOver the next year governments were toppled- nearly all by force. Militias grew in power and many great powers fell. Nearly all politicans got\n\nvoted out of office- except in Japan. The country's GDP was now several times stronger and it was the only safe place on the earth. Its biggest\n\nproblem wasn't the excessive illegal immigration but, the war against Chaos and its worshippers the Chaotics. It wasn't done yet- whatever\n\nstarted the war needed to be addressed. And knowledge of Chaos was unfortunately spreading to the aliens who had forgotten it. There was an\n\nenormous cost to do this to the earth, as the leaders would point out many times, and it was that the Chaos would spread everywhere it could.\n\nEPILOGUE\n\nA year later Karen's health improved significantly, though the war haunted her. What more, her nightmares still persisted. Inside her Royal\n\nPalace she cried and spoke to her advisors.\n\nQueen Karen- \"I can't stand it.... these nightmares plague me. Someone from Houston keeps being abused by terrorists. I don't\n\nknow who but my seers say it be a young man nearing 24- he'll die by then. Did you find him?\"\n\nNeumann Soldier- \"Yes! He is Matthew, a young man either brainwashed into thinking he's a prophet or an actual prophet. Either\n\nway, he's being abused.\"\n\nQueen Karen- \"Then save him. I sense much evil near him.\"\n\nNeumann Admiral- \"Anything for our great Queen. Our Navy is nearing the earth and will land in a few minutes!\"\n\nMeanwhile, in a small rural town, a newscaster is hysterical somewhere in Middle America. \"IT'S AN EMERGENCY, I REPEAT,\n\nAN EMERGENCY! ALIENS ARE LANDING SOON AND ARE SENDING MESSAGES OUT! THEY LOOK LIKE HUMANS EXCEPT MUCH TALLER WITH LONGER EARS!\n\nTHEY ARE CALLED THE NEUMAN AND ARE LANDING IN HOUSTON FOR REASONS UNKNOWN. THEY CAME BACK!\"\n\nNeumann Admiral- \"We're here. LISTEN UP! THE YOUTH IS AT 5510 CALM HARBOR. OUR SEERS KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM AND HE NEEDS TO\n\nBE SAVED! TERRORISTS ON THIS EARTH, PLOTTING AND ENGAGING IN TERRORIST ACTIVITY AGAINST THE HUMAN EMPIRES AND NEUMAN EMPIRE, ARE ABUSING\n\nHIM AND THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ARE COMPLICIT IN HIS ABUSE. YOU ARE TO MARCH TO HIM AND KILL ALL RESISTERS. RESCUE HIM AND GET HIM\n\nABOARD A SAFE SHIP IMMEDIATELY! THE CHAOS TERRORIST GROUP WILL PAY FOR WHAT THEY DID!\"\n\nNeumann Soldiers- \"YES, NEUMAN ADMIRAL! FOR THE GLORY OF NEUMANN EMPIRE AND QUEEN KAREN!\"\n\nWithin minutes countless Neumann ships landed. They fought many tough battles to land and a million soldiers marched towards the\n\nhouse. They encountered stiff resistance from America's corrupt military. Some things didn't change. A loudspeaker spoke urging them to\n\nstand down.\n\n\"STAND DOWN, REPEAT, STAND DOWN! WE ARE HERE TO RESCUE MATTHEW! WE ARE HERE TO SAVE HIM FROM FURTHER ABUSE AND\n\nTO STOP THE TERRORISTS DOING THIS TO HIM! WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE LIES ABOUT HIM AND KNOW WHAT HE WAS LIKE BEFORE HE WAS\n\nKIDNAPPED!\"\n\nWithin half an hour over several thousand armed forces of the corrupt U.S. government were killed and the Neumann made it near Matthew's\n\nhome.\n\nChaos Terrorist 1- \"What do we do!\"\n\nChaos Terrorist 2- \"Fight, fight, fight! For the glory of Chaos!\"\n\nThere were hundred of terrorists who appeared from out of nowhere. The fighting was mean and difficult and after some losses\n\nthe Neuman made it to the house. Matthew was hysterical to see aliens for the first time but they calmed him down and took him\n\nback to a safe ship. Soldiers remained to clean up the Chaos terrorist cell, especially that below the home in the sewer below.\n\nLater, they returned to Planet Light.\n\nSoldier 1- \"Is he safe! Is he?!\"\n\nNeuman Agent- \"Correct. The intelligence we gathered is.... of overwhelming value! These terrorists were working with elements\n\nwithin the U.S. government.\"\n\nSoldier 2- \"Why are there so many new wars happening right now?\"\n\nNeuman Agent- \"..... We can't discuss what we found under the house or his peculiar injuries.\n\nAt least now he can live safely with his mom who will be happy! Yes, she'll be delighted to know that-\"\n\nQueen Karen broke down and started crying uncontrollably.\n\nQueen Karen- \"Yes. That Sacred Youth will be happy now. My son can finally be happy.\"\n\nTHE END",

It turns out- war! Because this\n\nis a special child. A prophet child. Someone she knows all too well. He was meant for great things before he got kidnapped by an anti-Prophet\n\ncult that keeps abusing him to summon the evil and mysterious Chaos. Her dreams influence the empire- and war with the earth and humans\n\nwill happen if they can't or simply won't rescue him.\n\nIn 2019 there was an incident on the earth more famous than Roswell. It was known as the \"The Neumann Encounter\" although its real name is the\n\n\"The Neumann-Earth War.\" This is the story of when the Neumann are known by most to landed on- and waged war- against the earth. This is the\n\nstory of the Neumann Encounter and the permanent effect on the humans.\n\nCHAPTER ONE- \"IN THE BEGINNING....\"\n\nHumans didn't evolve alone in this universe. On 99 other planets, for a total of 100, humans evolved in conjunction with other races. One of\n\nthose races is known as the Neumann. About a foot taller with bodies and faces similar to humans (they hate hearing that) and long ears (they\n\ndon't want to be called \"Elves\" or be compared to them) they formed the largest empire in space. They were the first to evolve and evolved the\n\nfastest. As their psychics were fond of telling earth's psychics, they evolved the fastest and thus were the smartest. Humans evolved\n\nslowly but not the slowest, yet only had an empire of one planet.\n\nThere was a problem though- the earth was unwilling to unlock the psychic gene. It enabled those who did to communicate with mysterious beings\n\nfrom the afterlife- though only a small elite number of psychics could, no matter the alien race. Why wouldn't the stubborn earth just open the\n\npsychic gene? It was a questioned most had forgotten about. Earth's religions would evolve to be so happier and more tolerant with the psychic\n\ngene- and their technology would advance exponentially! It was a mystery none could ever decipher. The most popular theory was simply that\n\nthose who were psychics automatically earned and advanced more- with no competition! The psychics didn't fight or hate each much during all but\n\nthe worst of wars. They usually got along because, come plague of famine, they'd have gold and food and water aplenty. That's what Europeans\n\ncommonly said during the Middle Ages.\n\nThe psychic gene is nothing to be afraid of- it's a natural evolution that grows with exposure to the kind but mysterious Light. Though darker\n\nones, especially on the earth, would go with the merciless but mysterious Chaos. Neumann don't like to discuss the Chaos so that's a story for\n\nanother chapter.\n\nInside of an ornate, well-designed castle designed to make people smile and exhibit the nearly endless wealth of the Royal Holy family of the\n\nNeumann was a Queen known as Queen Karen. Indescribably beautiful for it's numerous well-crafted rugs and chandeliers and armor and antiques\n\nand beautiful silver (most Neumann prefered silver) and a staff of several thousand, it never failed to impress. It was part of a property for a\n\ndistance of about what 10,000 square miles are to the Neumann. It lay in the center of the capital in the wealthiest district of Royal Holy City\n\nGrandia on their Capital Planet of Planet Light.\n\nThe Neumann all lived for up to nearly 510 years of age. It gave them much time to acquire wisdom and ensure the leaders could make wiser\n\ndecisions. The shorter-life spanned aliens who didn't like their long age would simply say they evolved cleverness instead to achieve\n\nlasting legacy in shorter time without wasting time.\n\nThe Holy Neumann Empire had problems though- because several decades ago, it had lost a war against a rival alien race. Throughout it their Holy\n\nQueen suffered nightmares and droughts and famines were common throughout the Empire. The people said she simply needed to cure her nightmares-\n\nthough none of the seers where they originated from.\n\nShe always wore the finest outfits- with a preference for white- and wore gold crowns covered in priceless rubies with gold feather-like designs\n\nshaped like the most sacred of their animals on their most sacred planet. She was about 6'5 and had blue hair and blue eyes and was said to be\n\nof immeasurable beauty. Many Neumann men and women sought her out for marriage- and though she dated, she stayed single. She needed to find a\n\nway to address her nightmares before her health would improve. She was having a bad dream as she slept....\n\nA man covered in black and covered in shadows spoke to a young, thin man with dark hair and green eyes who was approximately 17 years of age.\n\n\"You stupid child of Holiness, of Light, of High Royal Blood. You stupid prophet. YOU WILL DIE!\"\n\nChild- \"NOOOOOOO!\" Before he could be harmed, she always woke up.\n\nQueen Karen- \"AGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!\" Neumann attendants arrived immediately.\n\nAttendant 1- \"What's wrong?\n\nAttendant 2- \"Shall we summon a doctor again?\"\n\nQueen Karen- \"I can't stand it.... these nightmares plague me. Someone from Houston keeps being abused by terrorists- on the earth! I don't\n\nknow who but my seers say it be a young man nearing 20- but he'll die by then. Can you find him? I finally got a lead- Houston!\"\n\nNeuman Guard- \"Yes! We'll investigate immediately and contact the earth and-\"\n\nQueen Karen- \"No... I.... I..... I need more rest.

He was a large, muscular Neumann fond of cigars, alcohol and men.\n\nNeumann General- \"Fuck it. We're invading. We invade, we'll rescue all prophets in Houston being abused till we get! That stupid backwater\n\nplanet- their psychic genes are barely active! This war will be fast and easy no matter what!\"\n\nCHAPTER TWO- \"EARTH POLITICS\"\n\n10,000 ships approached the earth- a small portion of the Neumann Navy. A message via hologram was being tranferred to all hologram viewing areas on all\n\nships.\n\nNeumann General- \"ALRIGHT, LISTEN UP ALL YOU SOLDIERS! WE'RE INVADING- SOON! WE'RE GOING TO HOUSTON TO RESCUE EVERY PROPHET WHO HAS BEEN ABUSED AND ACCUSED\n\nOF CRIMES THEY NEVER COMMIT-\"\n\n?- \"Greetings.\"\n\n\"Neumann General- \"YOU!\" It was a thin, mean, older man wearing a five star outfit. He was sitting in a large chair with other generals at the Pentagon.\n\n?- \"Yeah. Call me General Richards. You're all about to die.

Just let them go and we won't bother sinking a single ship or killing a single soldier. It's very easy.\"\n\nThe Pope showed up, infuriated.\n\nPope- \"BULLSHIT, BULLSHIT, BULLSHIT YOU.... GRR..... THEY WANT TO INVADE AND TAKE OUR RESOURCES, WE WILL NOT PERMIT THIS! BY GOD, ALL\n\nRELIGIONS CALL FOR A CRUSADE AGAINST THE ALIENS AND TO WIPE THEM OUT! THERE ARE FEW PROPHETS AND IT'S OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE, WHO ARE THEY?\n\nWHAT'D THEY EVER DO? DID THEY BUILD THE STATUE OF LIBERTY? THE EIFFEL TOWER? OR CREATE OUR SKYSCRAPERS? NO?! THEY NEED TO JUST DIE DIE DIE!\"\n\n\"You ill-mannered simpleton! They need to be rescued! This war is an excuse to abuse prophets to summon more Chaos to this darkened world! The prophets\n\nare a wonderful, beautiful thing who are a part of the natural order of things. IT IS UNNATURAL AND EVIL TO HATE THEM.\"\n\nPope- \"....\"\n\nThe Light is what we Neumann worship, not the Chaos! Light is good and Chaos is evil. Light spreads happiness and evil spreads-\"\n\nPope- \"....\"\n\nQueen Karen- \"It's unspeakable.\" She cried. \"The earth's leaders promised me I could deliver the address live.\"\n\nJapanese woman- \"We Japanese are curious. Just show the message in Japan- we're curious what the alien Goddess has to say. Just please don't\n\nharm Shintoism or Buddhism or our beliefs.\" Karen cried.\n\nQueen Karen- \"Thank you. I'm not here to harm your religions- any of them. People have a right to their beliefs but not to go out and harm the\n\nHoly and Sacred prophets. I will speak only to the Japanese and you'll have to hear this later. Pope, you have no manners, good day good sir.\"\n\nPope- \"Bah!\"\n\nJapanese man- \"Great, we want to hear! We want to hear!\"\n\nFor one hour and ten minutes, Karen spoke to Japan. There was little controversy- and its rulers seemed concerned about the dangers of the Chaos\n\nand the Chaoslings, and about the mysterious psychic gene that would uplift them to the stars above and give them an empire in space if they would\n\nonly let it open in all of them.\n\nCHAPTER INVASION- \"THE INVASION PART FIVE\"\n\nYou know the Neumann leaders need to just fucking censor this part. AND HOW THE AMERICANS AND THE REST OF THE EARTH SAY! Just.... no.\n\nThe war's a stalemate. The humans are indescribably powerful and dangerous to fight and have an almost unlimited amount of Chaos- and Chaosling\n\nallies. After two years, 1/3 of the earth's population were gone, drafted under heavily militarized states. Only Japan didn't fight- within an\n\nunknown amount of time, they turned over the abused prophets of Japan for concessions and permitted an embassy and trade with the Neumann. The\n\nrest is a secret they do want shared.\n\nCHAPTER SIX- \"AND THEN THERE WAS DARKNESS\"\n\nWhat is Chaos? It's a power the opposite of Light and-\n\n\"NEUMANN CENSORS WARN THE SCRIBER NOT TO TEMPT READERS WITH THE POWERS OF CHAOS. IT IS AN EVIL POWER THAT SPREADS HATRED, ANGER, BIGOTRY AND\n\nDESTRUCTION EVERYWHERE. IT CREATES NOT LIFE BUT \"CHAOSLINGS\" A RACE SEEN ONLY BY THOSE WITH THEIR PSYCHIC GENES ACTIVE. On the earth-\"\n\n\"AND THE CHAOS SAYS LEAVE IT A MYSTERY TO BE DECIPHERED. ONLY THE TRUE FAITHFUL ARE MEANT TO KNOW IT!\"\n\n\"NEUMANN SAY BEGONE!\"\n\n\"BAH!\"\n\nFINAL CHAPTER\n\nThe Neumann Empire might be the largest, but that small planet the earth hid many secrets. Nearly all of its top leaders secretly worshipped\n\nChaos and encouraged and spread its growth exponentially across the earth. The Pope just wouldn't convert- no matter what.\n\nPope- \"Karenism will NOT spread to this earth! The war will be won! The faithful will realize Chaos is nothing to fear but merely as aspect of\n\nGod that enables us to win against those vile aliens! We will triumph in the end because half the Neumann Navies are gone- and armies are gone.\n\nWe-\"\n\nHe spoke above Vatican City to the large, angry crowd below. Many people had awoken their psychic genes- and they kept disappearing to the Secret\n\nEarth Psychic Services Police. People were angry.\n\nAngry Italian man- \"FUCKER! THEY WIPED OUT MOST EARTH ARMIES YOU JERK!\"\n\nAngry Italian woman- \"WHY DOES EVERYONE WHO BECOMES A PSYCHIC WIND UP DEAD AND NEVER GET HEARD FROM?!\"\n\nJapanese man- \"ONLY JAPAN EMBRACES KARENISM, IT IS COMPATIBLE WITH SHINTOISM IT IS-\"\n\nPope- \"BLASPHEMY! THAT STUPID MAN IS TO-\"\n\nKaren- \"NOT BE HARMED!\"\n\nA Holygram- a special hologram delivering the holiest of all messages- appeared above the crowd showing Karen dressed as her ceremonial role, the\n\nGrand Exalted High Priestess of Light.\n\nPope- \"What do you want? Its over! You lost! The psychic gene is blasphemy!\"\n\nKaren- \"THEN THE LIGHT WILL SPREAD AND OPEN UP -ALL- PSYCHIC GENES! AND THE PEOPLE CAN DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES! BEHOLD!\"\n\nSuddenly, the entire Neumann population began praying for the Light to spread. Queen Karen raised her arms and hands in front of her in two large\n\ncircles for a minute- and then everyone on the earth saw Light for a second.\n\nKaren- \"WE'RE LEAVING! THE EARTH SICKENS ME! WE WILL SELL OUR TECHNOLOGY ONLY TO THE JAPANESE AND NOBODY ELSE.\"\n\nJapanese woman- \"DON'T LEAVE! HOW CAN WE FIND YOU! ARE YOU GOD!\"\n\nKaren- \"To many, yes. Our beliefs won't change or be censored no matter the earth demands. Just build a ship and find us- but your real enemy is\n\nChaos. Until this earth defeats it, all alien races confine you here until you win the war against Chaos. Only Japan will be assisted!\n\nNEUMANN- RETREAT WE HAVE LOST! WE RETURN HOME!\"\n\nCrowd- \"HUZZAH! HUZZAH! HUZZAH ITALY HUZZ-\"\n\nThey grew quiet and afraid because they could see the spiritual world. Yu Yu Hakusho? Bleach? Stories of ghosts? Stories of demons like in Inuyasha?\n\nThere were countless monsters that could be seen. Riots everywhere started across the earth of the population against the monsters. All televisions broadcast\n\nthe Neumann military leader- because Karen fainted from exhaustion!\n\nHigh General- \"We're leaving to take Karen back to Planet Light for medical attention. We will assist only Japan for one year and leave. Beware-\n\nthese powers are a blessing.... and a curse. Because you're not ready for them. But it was the only way to keep Chaos from spreading where it's\n\nhidden so long with you. No race will EVER hide the psychic gene again!\"\n\nOver the next year governments were toppled- nearly all by force. Militias grew in power and many great powers fell. Nearly all politicans got\n\nvoted out of office- except in Japan. The country's GDP was now several times stronger and it was the only safe place on the earth. Its biggest\n\nproblem wasn't the excessive illegal immigration but, the war against Chaos and its worshippers the Chaotics. It wasn't done yet- whatever\n\nstarted the war needed to be addressed. And knowledge of Chaos was unfortunately spreading to the aliens who had forgotten it. There was an\n\nenormous cost to do this to the earth, as the leaders would point out many times, and it was that the Chaos would spread everywhere it could.\n\nEPILOGUE\n\nA year later Karen's health improved significantly, though the war haunted her. What more, her nightmares still persisted. Inside her Royal\n\nPalace she cried and spoke to her advisors.\n\nQueen Karen- \"I can't stand it.... these nightmares plague me. Someone from Houston keeps being abused by terrorists. I don't\n\nknow who but my seers say it be a young man nearing 24- he'll die by then. Did you find him?\"\n\nNeumann Soldier- \"Yes! He is Matthew, a young man either brainwashed into thinking he's a prophet or an actual prophet. Either\n\nway, he's being abused.\"\n\nQueen Karen- \"Then save him. I sense much evil near him.\"\n\nNeumann Admiral- \"Anything for our great Queen. Our Navy is nearing the earth and will land in a few minutes!\"\n\nMeanwhile, in a small rural town, a newscaster is hysterical somewhere in Middle America. \"IT'S AN EMERGENCY, I REPEAT,\n\nAN EMERGENCY! ALIENS ARE LANDING SOON AND ARE SENDING MESSAGES OUT! THEY LOOK LIKE HUMANS EXCEPT MUCH TALLER WITH LONGER EARS!\n\nTHEY ARE CALLED THE NEUMAN AND ARE LANDING IN HOUSTON FOR REASONS UNKNOWN. THEY CAME BACK!\"\n\nNeumann Admiral- \"We're here. LISTEN UP! THE YOUTH IS AT 5510 CALM HARBOR. OUR SEERS KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM AND HE NEEDS TO\n\nBE SAVED! TERRORISTS ON THIS EARTH, PLOTTING AND ENGAGING IN TERRORIST ACTIVITY AGAINST THE HUMAN EMPIRES AND NEUMAN EMPIRE, ARE ABUSING\n\nHIM AND THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ARE COMPLICIT IN HIS ABUSE. YOU ARE TO MARCH TO HIM AND KILL ALL RESISTERS. RESCUE HIM AND GET HIM\n\nABOARD A SAFE SHIP IMMEDIATELY! THE CHAOS TERRORIST GROUP WILL PAY FOR WHAT THEY DID!\"\n\nNeumann Soldiers- \"YES, NEUMAN ADMIRAL! FOR THE GLORY OF NEUMANN EMPIRE AND QUEEN KAREN!\"\n\nWithin minutes countless Neumann ships landed. They fought many tough battles to land and a million soldiers marched towards the\n\nhouse. They encountered stiff resistance from America's corrupt military. Some things didn't change. A loudspeaker spoke urging them to\n\nstand down.\n\n\"STAND DOWN, REPEAT, STAND DOWN! WE ARE HERE TO RESCUE MATTHEW! WE ARE HERE TO SAVE HIM FROM FURTHER ABUSE AND\n\nTO STOP THE TERRORISTS DOING THIS TO HIM! WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE LIES ABOUT HIM AND KNOW WHAT HE WAS LIKE BEFORE HE WAS\n\nKIDNAPPED!\"\n\nWithin half an hour over several thousand armed forces of the corrupt U.S. government were killed and the Neumann made it near Matthew's\n\nhome.\n\nChaos Terrorist 1- \"What do we do!\"\n\nChaos Terrorist 2- \"Fight, fight, fight! For the glory of Chaos!\"\n\nThere were hundred of terrorists who appeared from out of nowhere. The fighting was mean and difficult and after some losses\n\nthe Neuman made it to the house. Matthew was hysterical to see aliens for the first time but they calmed him down and took him\n\nback to a safe ship. Soldiers remained to clean up the Chaos terrorist cell, especially that below the home in the sewer below.\n\nLater, they returned to Planet Light.\n\nSoldier 1- \"Is he safe! Is he?!\"\n\nNeuman Agent- \"Correct. The intelligence we gathered is.... of overwhelming value! These terrorists were working with elements\n\nwithin the U.S. government.\"\n\nSoldier 2- \"Why are there so many new wars happening right now?\"\n\nNeuman Agent- \"..... We can't discuss what we found under the house or his peculiar injuries.\n\nAt least now he can live safely with his mom who will be happy! Yes, she'll be delighted to know that-\"\n\nQueen Karen broke down and started crying uncontrollably.\n\nQueen Karen- \"Yes. That Sacred Youth will be happy now. My son can finally be happy.\"\n\nTHE END",

Unfortunately,  his actions result in him getting press-ganged into an expendable crew  of misfits recruited by a legendary starship captain. Their mission? To  recover a collection of lost sun-destroying missiles that could restart a  galactic war. Unfortunately, Vance is smart enough to know something is  wrong with this picture. After all, no sane person would recruit this  crew to save the universe.*\n\n*Space Academy is an all-new series from the hilarious duo of C.T.
