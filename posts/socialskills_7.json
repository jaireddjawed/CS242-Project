I asked if she mind if sat at the table and she said no. So I sat down. They were discussing something I don't know much about, and I didn't feel comfortable joining in the conversation. After that. they went quiet.  I had my eyes on my plate and ate my food, but I could see that my friend is staring at me. It was really awkward and I looked up, and she looked away and looked at the other person and they started laughing. I was really confused. The disgusting part is that they did this so many times when I was just eating my food. Can someone decode what was happening?",

        "text": "When I'm with a group of friends, I feel like I become a more extroverted and confident version of myself. I'm always able to contribute to the conversation, make jokes, and can easily fit in. I'm pretty much never excluded and people seem to enjoy my presence since I often get invited to hang out with the group again.\n\nHowever, when I'm hanging out with someone one-on-one, I become an awkward, rigid version of myself. It doesn't matter if I just met the person or if we've been friends for years; it always feels forced, uncomfortable, and boring. I can never think of anything to say, and every time I do, the conversation dies very quickly. I also feel this constant pressure to speak and fill in any silences, which only adds to my anxiety and makes the situation worse, but I can't stop. I feel like I become this fake, awkward, weird version of myself and that if I was truly being myself, everything would flow so much more smoothly. I just don't know how to break that shell.\n\nI think the reason for this difference is that when I'm in a group, I have the comfort of knowing that if I can't think of anything to say or respond with, there will be someone else to fill in the gap, and when there are silences, they don't feel awkward because I don't feel like it's solely because of me. Whereas in a one-on-one situation, I feel like there's so much pressure on me to keep the conversation going and entertain the other person, and if I can't think of anything to say, that's the end of the conversation.\n\nI have hope that I'll be able to overcome my issue with one-on-one situations since I was able to do it for group situations (as a bit of backstory, I used to be really quiet and was always the one who was left out of groups, but that has since changed completely :) ), but I just don't know how. Do you guys have advice on what I can do to improve my one-on-one social interactions? I could really use some help because these interactions always leave me feeling so drained and sad. Thanks.",

Drived hour to see this rap show only be told at the door that all the tickets are sold and then hour back home depressed.\n\nTheres not much of these events of my style and dont know if any will happen in many months now after this one..\n\nThese rap show events are only place where i feel like i could have a change to find friends of my kind and possibly some one who would became love of my life.\nWhat else place and situation there is for me to socialise if not these rare genre specific events???\nI cant figure anything else...... \n\nI am really in to old school hiphop so i really only go to bars and clubs when theres some rappers of that style having show and do not like to go bars and clubs other than that. \nHere is no clubs or bars of this genre.. only rare shows every now and then so have to wait months.\n\nI have really no friends or any social circle so meeting new people is really hard and rare.\n\nWell I do have coupke friends kind of but they live in other city and other country and im so bad at being social i have no idea what to message to them although i really want to talk to them......\n\nI just have no social skills and no idea what to say...\nIm very introverted and have trouple trusting people because of some not so nice things i have experienced.\n\nI also have no job or im not in school or such,,,, so i have no channel to meet people through and make friends and find love....... \nI tried to get in to this vocational technical school for photography but of course i was not chosen as always.......\n\nI have hobbies but no social hobby..\n\nI just always wanted to have couple friends in my life i can hang out with and find some nice girl yo fall love with... but my youth just flew through my eyes alone.........   \nIt feels horrible and im not sure how long i can handle this anymore.....  \nSome say you will get used to be alone but thats bs. I have been alone most of my life and now in my late 20s i feel just as miseraple being this lonely as i was feeling 15 years ago......\n\nAll i want is couple good friends or at least one and find some nice girl to fall in love with. \nThats all i ask.....\nIm very much lone wolf infj type introvert guy that likes to have own time alone,,,, but i never wanted to be this lonely.\n\nI was very broken mentally all my life so far and that made me loose any change to have normal life....\nMy life is a failure......\n\nAll i wish is just that i find friend and love..............\n\nBut where i could find them when i have no place to go to, no social sircle, ,,,, no any channel to meet anyone????\n\nIm just extremely frustrated, depressed and wishing some miragle to happen and find some one.....\n\nI cant take this life long lonelines anymore and im pushed in edge of,, well you may quess what........",

If I do say something that someone hears, they don't understand what I said or it wasn't funny or I don't know what I'm talking about. When I ask my buddies a question they would be answering quickly like, \"huh? Yeah sure.\" Then they go back to talking to their friends.\n\nSometimes people will seem annoyed at me for just being there. I'm not loud. I don't mope in front of them. I like to not complain or look sad in front of anyone. I do sometimes look uncomfortable though according to some of my friends but I can't control that. I had a friend who stopped hanging out with me because I wouldn't express my problems to them or ever say what's wrong. How am I supposed to tell anyone that I don't feel accepted without sounding like an attention whore.\n\nIt fucks with my head.

No need to worry.\" But no one's ever there for me. I hate venting because it feels like the vent is just unheard.\n\nAfter being ignored or unseen for the majority of the time I'll go sit down to listen to music.

Here are some tips that may help you:\n\n- Start with a simple message: Reconnecting with old friends can feel overwhelming, so start with a simple message. You can send them a message on social media or through text, telling them that you've been thinking about them and would love to catch up sometime.\n- Choose a comfortable way to catch up: When reconnecting with old friends, choose a comfortable way to catch up. For example, you can arrange to have a phone call or a video call. If you're not ready for that, you can arrange to meet them in a public place where you feel comfortable.\n\n- Plan ahead: Before you catch up with your old friends, plan ahead. Think about what you want to say and what you want to ask them. You can also think about what you have in common and what you can talk about.\n- Be honest: If you're feeling anxious or nervous, be honest with your old friends. They may have similar feelings, and being honest can help break the ice and make the conversation more relaxed.\n\n- Practice mindfulness: If you're feeling anxious, practicing mindfulness can help you calm your nerves. Take a few deep breaths before you catch up with your old friends, and try to focus on the present moment.\n\n- Be patient: Reconnecting with old friends can take time, so be patient. If you don't hear back from them right away, don't take it personally. Give them time to respond, and if they don't, it's okay to reach out again in a few weeks.\n\n&gt; Remember, reconnecting with old friends can be a great way to strengthen your social connections and improve your mental health. Take things at your own pace and be kind to yourself.",

We’ve been friends for years so we’re pretty comfortable and sometimes we bicker like sisters lol. But one thing that’s been irking me is how she acts like the things I say are weird? When they’re just funny? Like we saw this really buff dude so I jokingly said “Do you do steroids?” and he laughed and was like no. And she was like “Oh my god why would you say that you’re not supposed to ask people that, that’s so embarrassing.” and I was like it’s not that serious I don’t think it affected him. Another time we went to a vape store together and I was cautious because I know people get addicted . So the guy was showing us different vapes, I asked him if he vapes? He said yeah i do. I said are you addicted? And he was like no it’s not like that. And she was sooo embarrassed that I asked him if he’s addicted. I’ve always been pretty outgoing and friendly, and she’s always worried about saying the right thing doing the right thing fitting in, etc. I’m more bold and it bothers her. But that doesn’t make me socially awkward right? She was like you don’t know what to say in social situations. I was like um I know what to say but sometimes I just say things sarcastically or unexpectedly. I think if I was making people uncomfortable I would know. Right?",

Right now I have about six very close friends, there are other people I consider friends, but those six I have known for many years and I would pretty much do anything for them. \n\nI love my friends, and the most recent news, that one of them had to go to the hospital and is now staying at the psychiatric ward (with severe social anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts) came as a huge shock. Now I know, that I have to be there for her, and I am really trying not to let this get to me too much, but it's killing me. \n\nIt's not that I don't know, how to deal with one diagnosed with depression, it's the fact, that there are several people in said friend group with a similar diagnosis -my former roommate is suicidal, one of my best friend tried to commit suicide several times, another one is on anti depressants and with this situation now... \n\nI'm confused and angry and sad at the same time, not a single one of them deserves to suffer from this, they are all great people, I really don't know, where it all went wrong. \n\nI'm scared of waking up one day and they are gone.

I mean she's saying good morning to me, telling me to drive safe, hoping for me to have a good class, etc. and I would do the same back. well as of recently (known each other for barely a month now), she's starting to get really toxic. she's been saying stuff like, \"ima block u\", or \"ima ghost u, bye\". some days she does ghost me, but would reply back an hour or two later with a selfie or something. \n\nthing is, we hang out and stuff and she's been kinda flirty touchy. she's not as mean when we meet up, but she still plays the \"I'm giving u the silent treatment\" kinda deal, but I can at least tell its a joke in real life. she also doesn't do it as much as she would if we were texting. \n\ntoday is kinda where I crossed the line. long story short, we called for a little bit and she started saying some real mean shit like how she's always cranky cause people like me exist to bother her, and fuck you and fuck off. I decided to stop messaging her for the whole day today after that, telling her I'll stop bothering her but she'd come back with an inside joke we have a couple minutes after I said that to (I guess) \"relieve\" the situation a bit but I just left her on read. it's been well over 8 hrs or so since that conversation. as for the call, I don't think I've said anything mean? I just asked how her day was, how her exam went, and I mean I did poke fun at her laptop a little bit by saying how old it looks but I didn't mean anything by it. I was just tryna make conversation. wtf happened?",

For example, someone might ask me \"Do you like potatoes?\" And being the crazy potato lover I am I could give this person a whole essay on why I think potatoes are so f\\*ckin good. But I'd probably end up just saying \"yeah\".\n\nMy point is, I'm hard to get to know unless you specifically ask me what you want to know and I noticed it rubs people the wrong way. I tried being more social in this regard but I always turn to a blank slate when it comes down to giving an 'open' answer.\n\nI know why I'm like this and I see no need to change other than trying to please people around me. But at the same time I want to change to let people know that I actually do care cause otherwise I end up being left out a lot, as if people give up on trying to get to know me.\n\nSo I'm having a real hard time seeing if this is an obstacle I need to overcome or if I should just be relaxed with who I am. I do ask questions, I might now show many emotions but I do care and I have confidence in myself but that's not enough for some reason. I'm not completely silent in conversation but usually when I speak I do  it cause I feel like I need to, maybe I should just stop altogether and see the reactions.",

I’m 17 now and online, I am very confident and talkative but in person I almost shut down completely. I decided to get over my fear and join a volleyball team to get more active and make some IRL friends. \n\nIt goes pretty well in practice with just the team but when we are against another team especially with a crowd, I feel so out of place, I feel like everyone is staring at me. I went back and watched the recording of our match and I am acting weird with about 7 nervous ticks per second. Adjusting my shirt, cracking my knuckles, scratching my head, itching my arm, all of those constantly. \n\nI’m usually a bench rider (fine by me) and I witness my teammates do these amazing plays with little to no praise from our team, yet when I get put into the game and make a very simple play, my team yells and cheers, surrounds me, screaming “GOOD SHIT TOM”. This may sound like a good thing but it honestly makes me feel kinda bad about myself. It makes me feel like a little kid that did something very basic but all the adults are telling me that it was awesome. I know they mean well by it but idk what to do.

        "text": "Hello human individuals! I just wanted to share a perspective in how I personally embrace socialisation.\n\nWell here ill start with a smal not about me. It took me a while to realise, but I'm a little weird. I'm 25, queer, nerdy, LOVE maths, spiderman, octopusses, fantasy and i don't conform to gender roles. I often feel overwhelmingly anxious in certain situations and often don't quite understand many aspects of 'normal' socialisation.\nHowever I'm very personable and I'm generally liked. I've maintained good friendships for years. I'm the person who approaches the newcomer in the group, or goes out of my way to invite and include people. \n\nI've never tried to hide who I am, fit in of conform to expectations that I didnt see the point in. I've found I draw in people I can be myself around, and who are equally not achieving socialisation expectations. Humans labelled as: neurodiverse, lgbt+, anxious introverts, nerds and geeks and freaks and all that good shit... I guess these are my people and they might just be your people too.\n\nSo there's the general agreement that there are unspoken guidelines for positive interactions. Now some guidelines are always relevant. For example, you should try to pick up on feelings of discomfort from your conversational partners, or you shouldn't comment on someone's weight unless they do first, or you should ask someone before you touch them if a physically intimate relationship has not yet been established etc. These do change deoending on who yoyre around, and a lot of this you need to learn through observation and painful trial and error. \n\nBut there are many 'rules' that, if you're around fellow oddballs, aren't so important. It becomes okay to excitedly jump from topic to topic, it's okay to not maintain eye contact, it's okay to repeat what the person just said to allow your brain to catch up. It's okay to speculate about the weirdest crap, and it's okay to say what you mean! Interacting with fellow oddballs results in more genuine and fulfilling interactions. Yeah, there's still miscommunications, and you'll have to accept some eccentricities or maybe do a bit of social negotiation for some things if they break those rules/guidelines and make you feel uncomfortable. But in my opinion it's worth it to get to that genuine interaction where you can both just be honest. \n\nNow, the question is, where do you find fellow awkward and anxious whackadoodles. Well, do you have a special interest? Go to event nights. board games at local nerd shops or idc, drawing lessons, music clubs or sports or whatever interests are out there. At social events, look for the other silent ones or ones tapping their foot/fidgeting, or petting animals. Say hi, ask them some generic preset question about the common interest or event and maybe how they came about to be at the event... idk, but its cool if you slip in early that it's your first time here and you're kinda nervous or like, i often tell straight up that the crowd is jarring or that so much social stimulation is energy draining if they ask me how i am. Becauae it is, and saying it eases tension and sets the standard that a lack of social skill won't be met with judgement.\n\nConforming to the norm of socialisation is overrated basically is what I'm saying. \nFind the weird ones, let yourself be weird with them :)",

She said something along \"Anon was paying attention\"\n\nMoment two: Teacher was chewwing me out for coming late to class every day for like 6 weeks. The class starts at 7:30 and I sleep at 12:30, so I can't wake up early enough to wake up on time. Car ride is about 13 mins to school. I come 10 mins late usually. She told me that if she could make it, I could.\n\nMoment three: Teacher was giving us a choice between two lessons in one day, or one really easy lesson that'll take the entire class about 15 mins out of 1 hour to complete. I said two lessons, since I enjoy math homework, and I wanting to get it done with. She said \"even Anon wants this\". She then named me and like 5 other students who wanted what I desire, and gave them as examples. Not my friend who was sitting right next to me.\n\nI mean I would understand if these were one of events, but she doesn't comment whenever the teacher chews on another guy he thinks is lazy. Also no other students comment about me. Not to her extent at least.\n\nI followed her on instagram and slid into her dms lol. It ended awkwardly, and I made no effort to talk to her after I returned to school, as she did not follow me back and I took a hint. She is pretty hot so I tried to get with her. I mean if I was her, I would follow me, if I liked me, or ignore me complettely if I don't like me. \n\nI think the other students think I'm lonely because I don't interact with the school body, and only with like 3 friends. I'm not. I like my three friends, and I talk to other students in other classes. \n\nWhy do people gotta be like this???",

        "text": "I started a new job at a sushi restaurant about a month ago and it’s been hell. I have years of restaurant experience, but this place is nightmare fuel. If the money wasn’t insanely good I wouldn’t be staying.\n\nNone of my coworkers have been rude to me by any means, but all except one have acted mostly indifferent. I get no feedback, encouragement, support—nada. But, one of them has truly gone above and beyond to do all of the above for me. He’s been insanely kind, from always finding time to help no matter how busy he is, to giving me pep talks and a hug when I feel overwhelmed and shed a few tears.\n\nMy fiancé and I are planning on going to the restaurant for dinner on one of my days off next week, and I wanted to request him as our server and give him a gift to show my appreciation. I was thinking a thank you card with a personalized note and a gift certificate for a massage inside. I don’t know his interests that well, but I figure everyone likes massages—especially when their job is physically demanding.\n\nI’m just worried about being *too* nice? Almost like I’m coming on too strong? I’m not vying to make a best friend, I legitimately just want to do something nice for him since he’s done so many nice things for me. Am I overthinking this, or would it actually be a weird thing to do?",

        "text": " \n\nAlthough I dont think I have horrible social skills, there are times when I still feel nervous. Even though I'm able to project charm, it often feels like a facade, and I struggle to maintain friendships, even though I find it easy to make friends. I'm generally content with being alone, but there are times when I feel lonely, and the root of the issue is that I have difficulty committing to social interactions. When I do go out, I often regret it, but when I'm in a relationship, I become devoted and loyal. Unfortunately, I don't demonstrate the same level of dedication to my friendships, which means I often end up feeling lonely, even though I know that I'm the one who pushes others away.\n\nI know how to maintain friendships, but I often choose not to, knowing that I'll eventually need some alone time, which can sometimes last up to a year. Without this alone time, I can become angry and resentful towards the person I'm hanging out with because I'm not getting invited to things. For example, when I stopped talking to people, they would ask my ex-partner what had happened to me, even though they had my contact information. It seems that people often assume I'll text them with how I present my conversation, but it's not like anyone comes up to me to make friends, charm is really only present when I'm putting up a facade. It's possible that people notice this and don't ask me to hang out because they assume I will.\n\nI don't have many options. and I don't know what to really do; it just seems like a complex situation where I don't really have an out.",

        "text": "So for context, I've known this friend since middle school and we're now seniors, but we only really became friends in our sophomore year. \n\nWe don't hang out outside of school, and we used to talk over Insta all the time about relationships and academic problems, but now we communicate less and less. We sit together at lunch, and that's about it. \n\nRecently, I've been in therapy and have tried to focus on myself due to some traumatic things that happened during my sophomore year. I've been taking medication for my anxiety, and I've cut communication off from a lot of people, and her being one of them. \n\nAnyway, she's taken to being passive aggressive and loves to criticize everything I do. Which, considering my personality and how overbearing and socially awkward I am, I don't blame her for. I don't ever acknowledge the comments, but recently, I've been getting more and more annoyed. \n\nThree days ago, we had journalism and I had to set up a profile for an interview for this girl. This girl had a basic, common name, so I asked my friend \"who is she?\" because I didn't want to get her mixed up with another person of that same name. Instead of answering the question, my friend goes on about how \"annoying it is\" that I don't know anyone and she says something along that lines of, \"do you pay attention to anyone but yourself?\"\n\nI'm not sure why I blew up as much as I did, but I shot back and said, \"No, the only person I pay attention to is me because of my mental health.\" I've struggled with being overbearing with people for a long time, something that I've told my dried a number of times.\n\nShe says, \"Well that's really narcissistic of you.\" \n\nI kinda blew up. I didn't yell, but you could tell that I was upset. Instead of her stopping, she just doubles down and says that my mental health isn't an excuse and that I should try harder. \n\nI then say, \"I don't like how you've been treating me. I'm tired of explaining myself to people.\"\n\nShe ignores me. Later on, I snap her and apologize for blowing up, but I let her know that she really hurt my feelings and that I found what she said to be tone deaf. Instead of her trying to see where I was coming from, she basically said that I'm too sensitive and that she was being critical because it's something that her family does. I explained that though we're friends, she doesn't know about my problems to suggest any advice about my mental health. \n\nShe says that I'm attacking her personality because her personality is \"wanting people to improve through criticism\" and that I simply \"am being an extreme narcissistic and not taking her advice.\"\n\nI talked to my other friends about her, but not in a talking shit type of way. I said, verbatim, \"I wish she would understand that what she's doing is hurting me.\"\n\nYesterday, she texted those friends and said she was no longer going to be sitting at the table. My other friends blame me for saying anything and breaking up the friend group. They're ignoring me, and I'm sure that they're also talking bad about me as well. I don't know if it's just my anxiety and it's all in my head, but I don't know what else to do. I have to endure my friends bad behavior and whenever I say that I don't wanna be treated badly, they have am issue with me. I'm so incredibly tired of it.",

        "text": "I got into gaming when I was young and it was something that made me happy, but I think it was an addiction/coping mechanism that I used to get away from stress. I also ended up wanting to make it a career, but later in life kind of stopped enjoying it so much. I also got my dog when I was 17 and she's now 13. She doesn't get along with other animals and people in public. She gets extremely stressed if I leave the house so she's another reason I don't do much. I can't pin it all on her, but I am starting to wish I could just go out, especially with her and maybe do things. I'm just too scared of her hurting another dog or a person and having to put her down, or having her get hurt for being aggressive towards another dog.\n\nAnyway, I'm a little shy, but I don't think it affects me socially. I don't have a problem asking people in public for directions or at a store for help. I don't mind answering questions asked of me in public or elsewhere. My issue lies in continued conversation. If I don't have a question or someone isn't asking me a question, I have nothing to say. I sort of feel like even when someone does ask me a question I answer extremely factual and serious, and don't really know how to joke around anymore either.\n\nI recently started talking to an old friend from when I was 16 and they are shocked at how quiet I am. I was so different when I was 16 and she hasn't really wanted to talk to me after only a month of talking again because I'm so quiet. I think people think I'm not interested in them or I don't like them or something, but that isn't the case. I'm just very boring and very serious and don't know how to get back to the way I used to be.\n\nI think I also have a really hard time relating to people because I don't have much life experience and don't drink or do any drugs or anything. I feel like since I'm 31 and missed out on very crucial parts of social life, that I don't know if it's possible to reverse this issue.\n\nPart of me wonders if there is a medication that would help but I don't want to rely on that either.",

I'm not sure if I'm putting this correctly but I hope you're getting it.\n\nOther case is that, when someone is alone in the room, just like me. It's so easy to go there and initiate a conversation.

However if she's talking to someone while walking to the dorms, I just wait other people to leave. If the other person doesn't leave boooom my chance is gone.\n\nI guess my problem is that the larger people group gets, I stop trying.

This really upset me and my flatmates said they could definitely tell i was sadder afterwards. I cried all the way home. \n\nI think i try to be a kind, friendly warm person, and these people are friendly back when they see me, but when i’m trying to deepen the friendship if feels like I’m pushing.

So I think tutoring independently is my most practical option.\n\nI'm best at STEM subjects, but I'm not an *actual expert* in anything (yet). Usually it's Masters students and PhD candidates who tutor undergrads. I'm only in my first semester. So I think my best bet is to tutor middle/high school students in math, physics, and chemistry. I'm very strong on all that content and still using it all the time. Problem is, I, a childless 25 y/o man, can't just walk into any high school these days with a fistful of posters.\n\n**So how do I advertise my services as a tutor to grade 7-12 students and their parents? And how should I communicate with both parties to make sure everything is copacetic and above-board?**\n\nFor context, there's also no official licensing for tutors where I live. Also, the above questions are, as far as I can tell, the exact ones that *no* articles answer.",

        "text": "I had a “board day” today and all of us “heads of…” got together to understand better how the organisation was going. \n\nStaff from different divisions that we oversee came in to present what they’ve been working on and as usual, my colleagues were barely asking any questions. We had this for the entire day! A bunch of grown adults not asking any questions wasting time. It was going to be a jam packed day from 8am - 5pm. \n\nSo it got to a particular division I oversee and they don’t always get to see me, so they are sharing information and I asked questions. I asked THREE questions that piggybacked of each other and just before asking the  FOURTH question our chair said we were out of time. We did not run over. \n\nOur chair then proceed to make such immature comments about me asking questions, time management and essentially trying to make me the butt of the joke a few times in the day. It took my right back to my childhood. I was so fucking pissed off. Like WTF are we here then?\n\nAren’t we there to listen and fucking solve issues? What is it that annoys people so much about people who are genuinely interested in their job and want to make a change? \n\nI had a lot of respect for our chair until today. Not sure what the issue is or maybe there is a social rule I’m not aware of? New to the role and just keen to get things done. I have got things done so far too. We are ALL newly appointed board members.",

        "text": "! ALERT ! Huge depressive text\n\n\nI just don't know what else to do and with each passing day I feel like I'm losing a little bit of the will to live. Sorry for the sad post, but I wanted to vent and try to see different perspectives on my situation. I'm an 18 year old boy. There is nothing else that can define me more than the word failure, even more so when the issue is social. I have absolutely 0 friends. And I mean It. Only friends I remember are when I was really little (5 or 7 years old) and then never again. I'm a quiet guy but I try not to be shy when people talk to me, even then it doesn't seem to work. I'm in what feels like a cycle of defeat and failure. I have many dreams, but I have no motivation to go after any. I set goals for myself that I will never be able to meet. And I live a life of loneliness and sadness. I already tried to join clubs. I joined a volleyball club (because I like the sport) and I thought it would be the perfect chance to make friends. Everything was ideal. The club people weren't so talented, they were on my level and they all seemed like good people. The beginning was really cool, but then everything went off the rails. Most volleyball people stopped talking to me and created a \"group\" from which they excluded me. This is not the first time this has happened, at school the same happened. It seemed like everyone had a group to talk to, but I was the only exception. The most pathetic thing about it is that there was a boy there who was befriending me. I liked him a lot and that's why I went to volleyball often. We talked a lot during the matches. My mom was friends with his mom, and according to this boy's mom, he talked about me a lot when he went home. Honestly, I thought I was doing well. I tried not to look shy and be confident. I promise I tried to be as \"outgoing\" as possible. But do you know what happened at the end? One day when I went to volleyball, he brought a friend (I don't even know if it's his sister or not, he never explained it to me). Turns out he started talking only to his friend and literally shuts me out, that quick.\n\nI know it sounds like I'm exaggerating, but that's exactly how it was. I still tried to talk to him during the match, but he gave much less importance. To this day he only talks to that girl. They laugh together, play together and talk together. Even the teacher jokes that they are \"inseparable\". And the kid just stopped talking to me. I seriously try to not be annoying, so why? This isn't the only time this has happened. Several times I've tried to be sociable only to be ignored. It looks like I'm a ghost. For example, a girl hugs everyone in the class, even students she didn't know, except me (yes, that happened). I've been alone for about 5 years now. At first I just joked that I don't need other people's attention. But as the years went by, my situation became more and more apparent. I was alone. My life, which was already not so good, got worse. I stopped paying attention to my grades, I became unmotivated to do anything and I became much more insecure.\n\nIf I could define myself: I would say that I am a boy with social anxiety, depression, unmotivated, shy and insecure. Not to mention that on top of that I consider myself ugly. I'm only 5'5\" tall and I have red hair. Having red hair is not ugly, it's just that it scares a lot of potential partners away because it's something different. I have baby face, I look like I'm 15 and I don't say that because I'm insecure. Volleyball people started guessing each other's age and when it was my turn everyone was amazed to learn that I was 17 (only then, I'm 18 today). When It come about studies, as I said before, I had a total lack of motivation to study. I literally stopped studying. I just passed the year by a miracle. The grade on the report card was literally 1.0 to 0. My mother was even heartbroken when she saw the grades and thought I was going to fail. Nowadays I don't have motivation for almost anything. The hobbies that I'm interested in, I just don't practice them.\n\nFor example, I really want to do 3D modeling and drawing. It's a dream of mine, I want to do this. But I don't, and I don't know why. I'd rather lay in bed watching anything than go after my dreams. And every time I don't go after my dreams, my heart hurts. Because I know I'm wasting time. But still I don't get out of bed. That's why I said that the word that defines me is failure. I'm not good at literally anything. I don't have any talent. I'm at rock bottom. My life is literally waiting to die. And as much as my mind says it doesn't want that, my body won't move. I am defective in every way. I have anxiety; a possible depression; I think I'm ugly; I have no friends; I'm not good at sports; I'm not good at studying and etc... I was literally born with nothing. I've been to two psychologists, but it seems neither of them could understand me.\n\nThe first one barely managed to figure out that there was something wrong with me, even though I complained about being alone. And the second one, I literally said that I thought I was ugly and that I had no friends and I was suffering. He seems to have ignored the fact that I think I'm ugly and so far I don't know what he's doing. He already recommended me to try to talk more with my colleagues, but without success. Today I've just completed the last year of school, and they say the older you get, the harder it gets. My dad also died when I was 12. And I don't have any connections with my family members.\n\nAm I really destined to walk for this hellish path?\nI don't even know If this Is the right sub to talk about this, but I just want any help.",
