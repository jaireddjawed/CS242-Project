        "text": "Hi. \n\n\nI have a kid in K who is in speech therapy. While I understand that there’s plenty of phonetic sounds that I couldn’t teach and she had a delay with one year off in Pre-K when it closed. She was diagnosed with speech sound disorder. \n\n\nInitially, I was excited that she would receive help for her speech in ways that I couldn’t provide. I studied English in school, but have no experience teaching toddlers. I don’t know where the mouth/ tongue/ teeth go in order to help her make letters and how to get her to copy me. I also had a huge problem with getting very sad when she got upset that I didn’t understand what she was saying. I thought speech therapy would help and did notice improvements. \n\n\nHowever, I noticed that her classmates act like she can’t talk (one literally said that) and people criticize her speech to me, in front of her. I can’t help but wonder and worry whether this is giving her anxiety, potentially making it worse. I know that some children learn by copying what their peers sound like — but how is she supposed to do that if I think she’s been singled out? \n\n\nAnyone have any idea how much of speech therapy is really just improved social skills and fitting in and how much is the actual time spent doing it? I would like to pull her out of it, but the school is also saying that I can’t do that and mandating two more years. I only approved one. So, I’m not liking how they aren’t listening to me because I will not have a way to verify whether they are motivated for their own job or if she needs more help. I don’t have any reason to think this way, just the cynic in me is bothered. \n\n\nWhen I received my child’s report card, letter sounds she could say at home were marked wrong. Then, it really escalated with the teacher complaining about her lack of progress. I hear slow progress, but notice each new phrase and sound. The teacher wants to bring in more people\n\n\nI’m against that because I don’t know if I can be there to observe the interaction. I have yet to see anything harmful happen to her in a speech therapy setting. But, I do worry that some people will do testing on her or make rude comments about her speech in front of her. Honestly, I have had friends who were teachers with big drinking and drug problems. You cannot always control what teachers say. I’m also worried they will make her feel like some sort of clinical specimen. \n\n\nWith social skills and speech disorders, can treating make it harder on the child? \n\n\nI know this is not about me. However, I found that getting negative feedback and hearing she is still struggling really sucks. Part of it has also got to be possible fear or her peers. I’ll say I have been very anxious about this all week. I’m afraid that I will get angry at them if they are too mean to her or inappropriate.",

I’m 27M who lives in a nice city with great weather year round.\n\nI have two real groups of friends. One is my buddies from my home town, which I visit every other week to see my parents and partly cuz I have nothing going on in the city I live in (hour away from my place of residence). The other is my high school friends.\n\nThe ones in my home town are what I would call deadbeat. Constantly drinking whether alone or not, always smoking weed. Literally no hobbies. I can hit them up on the weekend to go somewhere and won’t hear back till noon, and that’s too early because they are just waking up. I do enjoy hanging with them from time to time but I seemingly have nothing in common with either.\n\nMy other group of freinds from high school are pretty chill, but now almost we all live in different states and never meet up. The one that does live nearish to me is in grad school and has no common interests as me. It’s almost a one sided friendship as I’m always hiring him up.\n\nI’m a single guy, and I’m getting incredibly frustrated that neither group wants to do shit. No travel, nothing. Not even to try new food spots. I’m feeling this existential dread that at 27, I’m not traveling, not living life to the fullest.\n\nThis past November I managed to quit weed after 10 long years of smoking heavy every day. To me, that’s a major victory. How do I move on? I’m tired of adding self-value based on other people. I don’t want to abandon my friends, but I’m at wits end on how to just make myself new and move on. I want to see the world and grow.\n\nThe first step of quitting weed and getting out from under it is done, but what’s next? Any advice is welcome!",

I won't go into detail on that but part of the reason I had broken up with her is because I feel like an incomplete person and our relationship was interdependent. I would have been to comfortable to ever really grow anymore. \n\nWe've been broken up a month and I've lost my mojo. I feel down on myself. Like a nobody, like I'll never make any friends. I always had trouble making friends in my life. I had some feelings of abandonment issues from my childhood that I'm not sure if I've ever truly gotten over. There was a period of time where I felt like I had real friends and then I didn't.\n\nI'm not a shy person, but I struggle to really connect with people, especially other men. The only people I have really been able to feel a real connection with is some women I have slept with or had mutual attraction in my life. There have been a few guys I had wanted to be friends with in recent years, but it just never worked out... \n\nI find myself cussing myself out and giving negative self talk- calling myself a loser. It's pathetic I think this way I can't even follow my own principles. I don't lack structure in my life. I exercise, I play sports, I have a full time job that I actually enjoy, I take good care of myself, but I just keep putting myself in this cycle of feeling unworthy, uninteresting, and stupid. \n\nNow here I am as a 29 year old man wanting to do the things I should have been doing when I was in high school and college. I look younger because I take good care of myself but I feel like I'm an outcast looking in.\n\nI feel so timid in social situations that aren't small groups or work related. I can go talk in front of a crowd no problem, even direct them, but when I really have to just be myself to 1 or a few individuals I clam up. Most people that meet me for the first time would probably be surprised that I have no friends.",

It can’t be a coincidence that in all aspects of my life I am alone and excluded from everything, I feel like I’m doing something wrong. I want to fix whatever it is that keeps people away but I don’t want to put people in an awkward situation by asking “Hey have i done something or what is it about me that is i likable?”\nI suffer from depression and have isolated myself from friends and family. They never asked me to hang out or spend time with them which led to a serious depressive episode. And at work, I am ignored by everyone including my manager. \n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation or had the courage to ask this? How did it go?",

        "text": "Without getting too long winded here's what I've got going on;\n\nI've never made friends easily. I moved around as a kid (broken home) and lost friends every time. Because of this I grew up not really valuing friendships. You don't really want something you can't have.\n\nYears ago I moved away for a job (with my spouse). Of the two childhood friends I have left I kept in contact intermittently with one, not so much with the other. I've now moved back (away 5 years) and have reconnected with both, but I find them not terribly interested in developing our relationship again. They're polite and we chat, but it's not the connection it once was, and I find myself doing most of the work. I feel if I didn't bother reaching out to them and texting to see how they're doing, they likely wouldn't reach out to me much at all. \n\nThese relationships are important to me and I try to convey that to them without outright saying it, but I'm not getting much in return. \n\nI really struggle with feeling like a social alien - I wasn't properly socialized as a kid and am missing some of those skills, but I'm really trying and it's not paying off. I don't know if I need to give it more time or what.\n\nAnyways, kind of a rant I guess.",

I decided to get away from them because they started hanging out with a former mutual friend that I didn't get along with) commenting on her posts and, at that moment, I thought that I had done something to upset him.\n\nHe didn't reached out for a whole year, and it was one of the most painful things I've ever felt about a friendship because I felt like he was the brother I never had, I thought we had a special connection and he was the only friend I had left.\n\n   Fast forward to January 2023, he messaged me on ig saying he was sorry and asking if we could meet to clear things up, I said yes because I was taught never to get carried away with resentment and I also remember our long friendship with love.\n\nWe met and everything went well, although I felt like he gave me shitty excuses, that he was having a hard time adjusting, and he felt like he wouldn't have been very supportive of my recovery.\n\nHe also complained that I didn´t reach out to him (even though I was the one who sent the last message and he didn't even reply) considering also that my brain was not working well, due to my state of malnutrition, believe me. I would have loved to try and save the friendship, text him more and be pushy, but that was the last thing on my mind, which was filled with thoughts of food 24/7.\n\nEverything went well after that, we even faced timed, he updated me on his life and I did the same, the thing is, he went on vacation last week, he told me that he was not going to be active and use his phone,  I wished him a great time and that was it.\n\nBut now I saw that he commented and liked my ex friend's posts (the one I talked about earlier), and I know this sounds so stupid, but I have posted 4 times in the last few days and received nothing.\n\nDo I have this right to feel paranoid and afraid that he's going to do the same thing and ghost me again?\n\nDo I give this friendship another chance even though I feel like I'm the one who is always giving but never receiving\n\nAn important point to consider is that this year I am going to his university and I am also majoring in journalism, like him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPD: I´m sorry if some words are wrong, english is not my first language!",

I got into clubs, especially acting as my therapist suggested it a a therapeutic measure. I'm in a better place now but I still struggle a lot, especially with making friends.\n\nBasically, I meet a lot of people is these occasions, I can hold conversations where people don't want to cut it short (in comparison with before college), I use humor a lot to please people and avoid conflict above all. I would qualify them as 'acquintances' yet I still have no ideas how to make friends.\n\nBy \"friends\" I mean the kind of people you can see without any specified context. Here, I can't get to interact with these people outside of our shared activities, no matter my efforts (which I make sure are not leaning into the awkward/unwelcome zone for them). I try to get to know them better, but it's never reciprocated or even held as a conversation.\nI don't feel like I matter to them outside of these contexts.\n\nI tried to go to parties, yet I can't for my life be comfortable in it. I drink a bit, but I can't stop being aware of everything and becoming an absolute hinderance to anyone interacting with me.\n\nSo how do I make friends, instead of acquintances?\n\nThanks in advance, and sorry for the flawed English.",

I found him interesting because of the way he can be so offensive, but still get away with it. What I have found is that it's a misconception that he is an \"offensive\" comedian, but in reality, he pushes boundaries for the sake of comedy, not offense. I've created a breakdown video to explore the techniques he uses to create dark humor, and how he gets away with it.\n\nHe's a master of creating laughter without crossing the line into offensive territory. One key element of his humor is understanding the dark assumptions his audience holds and then subverting those expectations for comedic effect. It's about understanding the person and delivering the unexpected. I highly recommend studying the works of Ricky Gervais and elevating your social skills to new heights.\n\n[https://youtu.be/HPOq7AHpZTg](https://youtu.be/HPOq7AHpZTg)\n\nLet me know what you think in the comments!",

I feel like I'm just a 3rd, 4th, 5th, etc wheel when hanging out with my wife and her friends. It's a bit depressing and I'm not sure what to do, or how to make male or female friends. TBH, I'm starting to feel a bit jealous of her and it's because I don't know how to make friends when really.\n\nMy Interests:\n\n* Exercising - Gym, hiking, outdoor activities. My size usually scares people away, I have a lot of stress in my life so I typically overdo it at the gym. Being this size has made me a bit self conscious since people are afraid to talk to me, when I'm really a super chilled person. I'm not violent, I don't get angry, etc.\n* Boating - I live in Arizona, so in the summer months I go boating a lot (own a surf boat) since it is extremely hot\n* I like traveling, wouldn't mind meeting couples who want to go with my wife and I to fun places (Vegas?)\n\nHow does a man go about making friends? Should I just join Facebook groups that have the same interest as me? I see lots of boating Facebook groups, but I assume those people already have boats and just go themselves. Men seem to be intimidated by me since I'm basically a power lifter, and I'm very well off in my career. I don't mean this in a boastful way, it doesn't matter to me if I have friends who are employed or unemployed. As for making friends with women, I have no idea. I would love to have female friends who have an SO and could hang out with my wife and I occasionally and wouldn't lead to anything else. I want nothing but a friendship and someone I could talk to. My wife is Bipolar Type 1, and sometimes it can be extremely difficult for me to relate to her and would be nice to have a friend to give me insight. \n\nIs any of this possible? Am I just so out of touch from working that I can't make friends? Seems so easy for my wife, she has lunch with friends almost every day. I typically just work and do Doordash. My wife and I are extremely fun people and non-judgmental. How does one talk to people without coming across as intimidating? Some of my wifes' friends have said their SO were initially intimidated by me, when I did nothing but just being there.\n\nThanks everyone!",

Cordial, but nowhere near as friendly as we have been, and almost to the point of being terse. Me, being a serial people pleaser and having incredible social anxiety, is terrified that I’ve done something wrong. My brain has come up with any number of reasons this might be: after all, Our professional community is small, and gossip is a blood sport. \n\nThe prospect of losing this friendship is extremely painful, if only because I’ve known this person for most of my adult life and the profound impact they’ve had on me. I do acknowledge that this is *my* need for the for the relationship, and not necessarily theirs. \n\nIt’s worth noting that they’ve had some serious health problems recently, but they’ve denied that it’s impacted their lives in any way. \n\nDo I even bother asking what’s happened?  \n\nOr do I let it be, acknowledging that relationships change and end and it’s not worth being pursing it?",

I consider myself realistic but optimistic. I can also take action despite the stress.\n\nHowever, the one aspect of my life that constantly screws me over is my social ineptitude. This one thing is my greatest weak point. Every time I re-open that aspect of my life up to try things out (years of SERIOUS effort), take risks, and grow, I seem to keep ending up in the same place and it's both terrifying and anxiety-inducing.\n\nNow that I've secured a solid job and decent pay and I have a degree of security with work, I decided a few days ago to start addressing my crumbled social and relationship life (all stemming from my social ineptitude) which I've blocked off for years to focus on my career (while actively ignoring the effects this weakness had on my performance in all aspects of my life), and honestly, my stress, anxiety, and inability to sleep has been through the roof since I've started to re-open that wound.\n\nSince re-opening this issue only 4-5 days ago, I haven't been able to do much at work for the past couple of days, I've been sleeping later than usual and inconsistently, my mood has been absolute shit, and it constantly feels like something is sapping my energy and nuking my self-esteem to oblivion. I've gone from a daily 5.5/10 in terms of my average mood and happiness, to a 2.5/10.\n\nIt's like imagine you have a hidden disability that people can't see and affects you intermittently and decreases when you avoid situations where it's highlighted (when that's possible) because all your SERIOUS and motivated attempts in the past to change it failed, so you live as if you didn't have the disability, but now you're re-opening it again and the anxiety of the disability is in your face again.",

I don’t mean to bother you, but I wanted to ask if my jokes have been bothering you at all. I don’t mean to distract you, it just seems like you’ve been getting angry with me lately and I’m confused what the problem is. I never meant to bother you” or something like that. does that sound like it’ll work? i’m trying to calm him down enough to finish my last 2 weeks and then move across the country and never see this guy again. so any suggestions? \n\n\nside note, my first reaction would be to tell the store manager about the situation, but i’ve already mentioned it to him about another employee and he sounded understanding at first but then didn’t do anything or talk to her about it. another big reason why i’m quitting. so i doubt he’d do anything about this situation too. and i’m pretty sure the guy who’s been aggressive with me is his brother or roommate or something so they’re already close",

        "text": "I’ve been struggling with doing something about this for a while but I dont really have anyone to talk to so im gonna go out on a limb and post on here. Sorry if the story is all over the place but its just how I think.\n\nLately i’ve been feeling like shit with my ‘best’ friends. I’m 15 in my sophomore year of high school, im pretty nice and im outgoing when I loosen up around people but for whatever reason im pretty reserved around people I don’t know and I feel like thats part of the issue. Anyway i’m starting to genuinely dislike hanging around my friends, they constantly just pick on me, and ive noticed that they do it to me but mainly just me, which just makes me feel like shit. We also have this other group (all girls) that we hang out with sometimes, and they still make fun of me and it feels like its for attention. I’ve gone to my friends for advice on how to make more friends and just be more outgoing, all they say is “talk more”, “be outgoing” blah blah, but I feel like I cant do that because whenever im around them even if we’re with people they just make fun of me. Whenever I say almost anything at this point they either completely ignore it or say shut the fuck up or something just rude for people that are supposed to be your best friends. People might say “aw theyre just joking chill” or theyll say “bro its all love” when I call them out, but the problem is its just me, and they always call me a pussy and all that bullshit - I get that friends joke around obviously but why am I the one picked on the most.\n\nAnother thing that I hate is that they dont even seem to care about me or my problems, if I have an issue they never help or even try, they all prioritize themselves first, and you should, but not as much as they do.\n\nLately i’ve been feeling more reserved and im starting to resent even talking to them, let alone go to the sleepovers and shit we have. I feel like no matter what I do, no matter what I say, no matter how much I try to fix things or tell them to fuck off, it doesn’t work. My escape from all this is pretty much just the gym and music to be honest, but it only helps so much. Part of me wants to just say fuck you guys im not hanging out with you, and maybe that’ll make a difference, but I cant do that because every single day im at lunch with them, and one of them comes to the gym every day when I go. I also don’t want to do that because one of them has been my best friend since the third grade and I can’t just let all of that go. They don’t get it, even if they knew I felt like this (which they somewhat do) they wouldnt even care, they dont care about me at all. It sucks too because i’m a huge reason this group is even a thing in the first place. Every time I do something or give an idea it either gets stolen or it gets no reaction and people just ignore it.\n\nIdk man, im just feeling like shit about all of this, the rest of my life also sucks and theyre no help. My whole family is a mess, my dads barely in the picture anymore, he doesnt even seem to care about me. My grandfather who was the greatest and nicest person ive ever known passed away a few weeks ago. My sister who im super close with is away for uni. My parents just spit their stuff on me all the time (mainly my dad when I see him). My step family broke apart a few months ago after 8 years in the same house. My life is in a pretty shitty place and nobody seems to recognize or care about any of it.\n\nI need advice and help, I dont know what to do.",

I graduated highschool so i cant make friends there. I have severe trust issues with women also.. I had a friend that betrayed me, lied, told me to hurt myself and tried to seduce my boyfriend. I don't want to generalize everyone but it makes it very hard for me to trust anyone. I know these things can take time most people aquire these things through experience, im only 18 but this is bothering me beyond being able to ignore it.\n\nLately I've been thinking about who I am and my heart hurts. I stay home, play video games, draw, hangout with my boyfriend and go to work. My boyfriend always has so much to talk about but when it comes to me all i can say is \"nothing much\". I feel like I'm so boring he'll eventually leave me. I mean, who wants to be with someone who never has anything to talk about? No stories of adventure? Just plain \"ok\". \n\nI really want to fix this but a part of me is telling myself I've already lost my chances to make friends. That I've already lost my chance to be someone. I'd love advice or tips, any sort of help. Thanks.",

Over the last year I've been trying to work on myself and I think it's really starting to make a difference.\n\nWent to the bar with 4 friends last night (21/22m) and was playing some pool when one of my friends hit the cue ball off the table. The bartender (maybe 30?f) then asks for a dollar for hitting the cue ball off the table, it's bar rules. My friend (I'll call him C), who's been watching way too much Andrew Tate, reluctantly pulls out a dollar and tries to make the bartender walk over to get his dollar because he thinks it's some \"alpha move\". Other friends and I start to call C out for not walking the dollar over when he says \"I'm not gonna walk my money over to some b-\". I then call C a b-, eventually the bartender walks over to grab the dollar bill, and C gets mad and walks home. After 30 minutes the rest of my friends and I walk home. At some point I hear a conversation in the other room where C says \"I just don't like being called a bitch\" and other friends consoling him. I immediately walk over to put a stop to it and tell him he WAS being a b- and how ironic it is that he doesn't want to be called that but is fine saying it about an innocent bartender. He gets mad again and goes to bed.\n\nI just wanted to share the story since it's the first time I've ever put this much strain on a friendship, but I don't feel bad about it at all",

Everything I worked so hard for, months of work, time and sleepless nights gone in 10 seconds…\n\nI lost Rotty as a friend which was perplexing because the screenshot had 0 to do with him yet I was removed from staff on another server entirely. \n\nIan said I’m on his “shit list” \n\nI basically was humiliated to the very core. I know most reading will think, oh well it’s a video game/discord server but at the end of the day this was my time invested into these projects that meant a lot and still do mean something to me, I took responsibility but yet I still feel the horrible pangs of what this woman did…I just don’t know how to move on.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice for me? \nYanni my BF is in deep as he is paid and the rest us do this voluntarily. I appreciate you reading I just need a new perspective on the situation from an outsider view.",

        "text": "Last night I went to a carnival party in my small town and everyone was dressed up (I was dressed up as a pineapple).\n\nI went with basically the only actual friend I have in this town.\n\nWhen the music started, I engaged in very dynamic type of dances, infact, I was probably the most dynamic dancer there.\n\nSome of these dances might have been bizarre (think the Ron Mael dance from Sparks) but it's not like I did anything particularly crazy like sexually explicit, I wasn't even that drunk. \n\nWell, at some point I was approached by a girl who told me \"Yo what is this dance? can you teach my friend?\"\n\nThen after a while, that same girl took my hand and brought me to her friends to teach them that dance (which I didn't, because after trying they said it was too hard).\n\nThen later another couple girls came to dance with me and started copying my dances. Then, when I turned around me, I could see groups of girls giving me a thumn up.\n\nAt some point my friend took my arm and pulled me out of there, saying \"They're just making fun of you, don't let them disrespect you. They're not your friends, to them you're just a guy who's dancing\" and that kind of upset me and made me self conscious the whole night. \n\nWas I really making a fool of myself? Are the reactions from these girls indicators that they were just making fun of me and I was just acting as a fool? \n\nCould it be he saw girls laughing at me while I wasn't watching? \n\nI mean, is there really a \"appropiate\" way to dance when people are dressed up as silly things as tetris pieces, sales receipts and men dressed up as Wesneday Addams and Harley Quinn?",
