        "text": "Hi! Been a while since I posted. I have been replacing a bunch of old $Hell $Perspireon desktops to brand stinking new $IQ $ProfessionalFurniture small form factor desktops. Quite beastly, no spinning storage, it's basically a laptop but in a desktop format. Now you can imagine, a PC not moved for a few years is bound to be a dusty, maybe a few cobwebs. But, let me share with you what I found.\n\nI was sent to bring the old $Hell computers from the main to the satellite office and replace the older than dirt AIOs that were in the satellite office. However, front desk gets a brand spanking new $ProfessionalFurniture lap-desktop. As I'm unplugging the old one, I notice that the power strip is covered with spider/cob webs (maintenance apparently has been slacking) and proceed with no difference. Then I see... it. \n\nIt was a [BLACK WIDOW](https://www.desertusa.com/insects/black-widow-spider.html) (link included for those fortunate to have never seen them), and It was about 2 inches from my hand, and VERY angry that I just destroyed it's house. I, while nearly simultaneously sh*tting myself, scream and pull my hand back as fast as I could, grab the nearest cardboard box, and start smashing all around and on the power strip. However, I don't see any splatters on the box. That means that death machine is around. (If you're confused on why I am so scared, the only cure for a black widow bite is to sit in pain and agony for 24 straight hours while being injected adrenaline to keep your heart pumping, and if you go out, you're out for good.)\n\nI finish the install using a piece of foam from the monitor box so I don't reach my hand near that power strip, and do it in record time. The cabling looks like my underwear at the time, but it all works (thank God) and I start to configure the computer.\n\nI tell the person (old clueless lady who has a track record for not listening to IT or management) who works at that desk this whole situation, they say \"oh okay\" and sit right down and start working, despite my many warnings to NOT do just that. Well, if they won't listen, they can die. They're still alive, but that is WAY too close for comfort for me. When I asked about what she would do if she sees the spider, she says she will grab the hand sanitizer bottle and spray it on the spider... yeah, good luck. That'll just make it clean. And more angry. \n\nI have another story that's currently unfolding with the same user and same computer. I'll report back once it's done!",

        "text": "Hello there!\n\nFirst time TFTS, be gentle!\n\nToday's story revolves around the wonderful shenanigans of plain telephony.\n\nI work for an internet/phone provider. Due to some construction work, 1st level techs, 2nd level techs &amp; complaint management share a pretty big temporary office.\n\nCustomer calls in an issue: there's a single phone number in Germany they can't reach, which is clearly our fault and we should fix it. Colleague creates a trouble ticket. I am the lucky one to get the assignment. We first check their line. Everything's working fine. We test the destination number from our end. Can reach the number without problems. We let the customer test several national and international numbers. All work fine. Only this single one number they can't reach. Since there's nothing out of the ordinary I consult with our voice expert. He double-checks all settings, looks perfectly fine, only difference to our own test line it the customer has CLIR (calling line identification restriction aka. hiding your phone number) active. So we enable the feature on our end and try again. Suddenly we can't reach the destination number. Disabling it for the customer line, informing them about it and asking them to make the call. Works like a charm. Apparently the destination number automatically rejects all calls with CLIR active. Alright.\n\nSo I call the customer and inform them about that. Explain that there's nothing 'wrong' at our end, but the destination number automatically rejects calls that don't show the originating number and that if they want to reach the number have to turn CLIR off via a code on the phone. Took a time but they got it (or at least I felt like they've understood). Called the destination number and explained the same thing to them, in case they weren't aware that they had this feature active. Case close. \n\nSuddenly colleague XY reopens the ticket. Said customer wants us to fix the issue, as they want to call *every* number without sending their own. So I call the customer again and explain to them - again - that this is out of our power. It's not us that prevents them from reaching the destination number, it's the destination number's settings that automatically block calls with active CLIR. So far so good. Case closed.\n\nA while later colleague ZA taps me on the shoulder. ZA works in complaint management. Apparently said customer filed a complaint an hour later, since they \"can't reach a certain number in Germany without sending their phone number\" and is threatening to cancel her landline. Told ZA what was up again and that there's no solution to their problem (unless the destination number changes their policy). When ZA asked if I could call the customer back and explain it to them I respectfully decline though....",

And it's a rather short one.\n\n*****\n\n**Backstory**\n\nI consider myself as a very friendly person. Being nice to people is what helps you avoid problems or helps you quickly solve them. This is why i tend to befriend people around me that i might need help from. No matter if it's facility management, logistics, external craftsmen, whatever.\n\nSo the guy relevant for this story is one of those craftsmen. A bit old, funny, no BS guy. He's always around even though he's working for a contractor. I'll call him Jerry in this story, because of the cat. Usually he's the guy that does non-power cabling for us, be it fiber or twisted pair. He also does desk wiring. The desk wiring is the relevant part this time, he was busy wiring some desks with those USB3 Docking stations. Remember those docking stations for IBM/Lenovo laptops? Like that, just with a single USB3 cable. \n\nAs we are in the process of getting a few new buildings up and running, Jerry is always busy on the construction site and knows the most current state of it. This is also the perfect excuse for me to sneak from my desk and ~~kill some time without anyone knowing where i am and bothering me~~ inform myself about the current state of affairs. \n\n*****\n\nIt was a hot sunny day, shortly before my vacation. I was donning a shit-eating grin on our post-lunch walk around the location that was conveniently built on a hill right in the middle of a valley, all surrounded by small forests and humongous vineyards. Though the scenery was not the reason for said grin, but the jealousy of my colleagues at my attire. As usual i did not give a damn and decided to wear shorts to work.\n\nOur walk leads us through the whole parking lot that by now completely surrounds the fairly large location - about 6000 people work here by now, two years ago i was one of the first over 4000th. Just as we went back onto company premises, a well known yellow van pulls up to us.\n\n&gt; me: Hi.\n\n&gt; Jerry: Hi.\n\n&gt; me: How's it going with construction? *grin*\n\n&gt; Jerry: *clearly sarcastic* Ready for move in!\n\n&gt; me: Heh. What's up?\n\n&gt; Jerry: Do you have a few cables?\n\n&gt; me: What kind of cables? And define \"a few\" please.\n\n&gt; Jerry: Like...350 or so. USB3 cables, 3 meters.\n\n&gt; me: Nope, Network guy, not my kind of cable. But WTF? Why do you need so many?\n\n&gt; Jerry: Ah, yeah...Well...remember those dockers? We're busy wiring those nicely into the tables and after doing a pair or two, we decided to test them. They don't work.\n\n&gt; me: Whut?\n\n&gt; Jerry: Well...partially. The keyboards and mice attached to them work, network does too. But the two displays don't. If we take a completely different USB3 cable than the ones we have, it all works perfectly fine. Which means we're in need of cables. Lots of cables.\n\n&gt; me: Soo...did local IT order those?\n\n&gt; Jerry: Nope.\n\n&gt; me: Well, there is your problem.\n\n&gt; Jerry: Yup...but at least i have an excuse to not be crawling under desks for now. Gotta go. See ya.\n\n**TL;DR:** These are not the cables you're looking for.\n\n*****\n\nPrevious Stories:\n\n* [Don't do the thing - Oops, i did the thing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/4eqzlr/guys_dont_do_the_thing_it_breaks_stuff_oh_i_did/)\n\n* [Snowflake Servers](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7hy00f/netnotworking_snowflake_servers/)\n\n* [Personality issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7ie176/netnotworking_personality_issues/)\n\n* [Internet of Sh...](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7juazk/netnotworking_internet_of_sh/)\n\n* [Wait for it...](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7oyi52/netnotworking_wait_for_it/)\n\n* [Hello Darkness my old Friend](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7ui7e1/netnotworking_hello_darkness_my_old_friend/)\n\n* [Here is your shovel](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/85jotu/netnotworking_here_is_your_shovel/)",

        "text": "I once worked a contract job for a local government as a helpdesk employee. That contract lasted roughly one year.\n\n​\n\nA couple of years later, the helpdesk at this local government was short handed and hiring for full time positions. Hiring new people happens at the speed of government, which meant that the helpdesk was short handed for almost six months by the time they hired me. There were TWO helpdesk techs supporting roughly 1200 users. I was \"fast tracked\" because I had worked well with this team and was already familiar with the policies and procedures.\n\n​\n\nWhen I was hired, each of those techs had well over 100 old tickets in their queues and they were falling behind daily. It was assumed by those techs and by me that I would immediately start picking up tickets and helping them with their backlog. We were wrong. I was immediately assigned exclusively to the rollout of a new antivirus software, which took close to three months. The day I was released to work on tickets, I had over 100 tickets in my queue.\n\n​\n\nWith my help, we were able to clear out some of the backlog. I mostly handled OLD tickets and new emergencies, while letting the other two try to dig out their own queues. The CIO, in his infinite wisdom, hired \\*THREE\\* contractors to give us a hand... or so we thought...\n\n​\n\nThose THREE contractors which would have been \\*SO\\* helpful to dig out the helpdesk backlog were instead hired to write a \"knowledgebase\" that was supposed to help us do our jobs. It took over a year to complete this \"knowledgebase\". These three contractors would hold meetings in the tech area, pester the techs about common problems, pester the programmers about their projects, and generally demand documentation on everything. So, not only did they not help the helpdesk close any tickets, they took an active role in slowing us down. When the knowlegebase was finally revealed, we learned that it was a software knowlegebase.\n\n​\n\nOur CIO gave us glowing reports of how wonderful the knowledgebase was and suggested that we start using it immediately. A month or so passes with none of the techs using the knowledgebase and we have some new meetings again extolling the virtues of the knowledgebase and suggestions that we start using it. We were told to bring examples of how we used the knowledgebase to the next staff meeting. At the next staff meeting, again, none of us can show that we used the knowledgebase at all. This initiates a furious dressing down of all the helpdesk techs and how we are lazy and ungrateful and we should be using the knowlegebase for the sake of efficiency. He demands that we show tickets where we used the knowledgebase for the next staff meeting, or there will be \"repercussions\". Even with these threats over my head, I was only able to show that I used the knowledgebase ONCE.\n\n​\n\nA user contacted me about not being able to send an email to some particular recipient. A few seconds of looking at the return email shows that there was no such recipient. A few more seconds of looking through the users inbox, shows that the user typoed the recipient's email address. I then sent him a link to the knowledgebase on how to use Outlook. This would not in any way help the user to not make a typo, but it was the closest thing to using the knowledgebase that I had run across. You see... our shiny new knowledgebase was about software and how to use it. There were sections on word, excel, outlook, and the various and sundry programs that were used throughout the organization.\n\n​\n\nMore than ninety-five percent of the calls received by the helpdesk were not about how to use the software. The tickets we got were about hardware failures, software failures, malware, password resets, etc. etc. etc. Pretty much nobody ever asked us how to use any particular piece of software. This made it almost impossible to use this new knowledgebase for much of anything.\n\n​\n\nWhen the next staff meeting came along and once again, we could only barely show that we used the knowledgebase at all... The CIO lost all of his bluster and asked us WHY we weren't using the knowledgebase more. We responded that we simply did not get tickets about how to use any particular software... we got tickets when something went wrong at a hardware or software level. By and large, the people either knew how to use the software or got along without it. So... the CIO got a gleam in his eye and asked us to start writing HARDWARE articles for his new knowledgebase. I chose to write an article on a very common problem, \"My computer won't come on.\" It was BEAUTIFUL... it had full color pictures and closeups. It showed both ends of a computer power cable and pictures of what they should be plugged into. It explained in great detail that the computer could not operate without electricity. It had a picture of the power switch on the most common computer in use.\n\n​\n\nBefore I could get into trouble for the epic levels of snark in this document, a new mayor was elected and the CIO was summarily dismissed. The three contractors were also summarily dismissed and as far as I know, the new knowledgebase was deleted and never spoken of again. By this time, the helpdesk had FINALLY dug out from under the backlog and was operating reasonably efficiently. Especially since the contractors were no longer pestering us for documentation of systems that for security reasons could not be published.\n\n​\n\n​\\*\\*EDITED to add some background and/or details\\*\\*\n\n​\n\nI feel it might be useful to add a few details. First, the technicians had access to multiple resources for resolving issues. The ticketing system we used had a built-in knowledgebase that was only accessible to the technicians. We wrote the articles for that knowledgebase and while it was a little sparse, it contained some very important information. We only put in articles that were relevant to our work and we didn't bother putting in articles for obvious solutions. We also had a network shared \"tech\" folder that contained installation instructions, software, manuals etc. The CIO wanted his knowledgebase to be publicly accessible for self training. It was huge, difficult to navigate, and for the most part had the documentation that came with whatever software copy/pasted into it. For example, I'm pretty sure the entire help system from outlook was pasted into it. Again, we didn't really get calls about how to USE software, so the resource was largely useless.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Edited to add link to \"my computer won't power on\" document. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/17hD7RW6gI-seVec-ppE33SGU2WoOipB-/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17hD7RW6gI-seVec-ppE33SGU2WoOipB-/view?usp=sharing)",

        "text": "Hi TFTS!\n\nLTL, FTP, Non-Native Speaker you know the drill.\nAlso sorry if I screw up the formatting, this is my first properly formatted post so please bear with me. (rawr)\n\nThis is not a story that happened to me, but a colleague of a very good friend when she was working at $SP in the past.   \n$SP was providing a pretty niche application called $software and are one of the largest providers for this type of application in europe. Thus having customers that aren't native to (Common Language) is not unusual. Most customers are pretty nice, but as always there are some rotten eggs in the basket.  \nAlso since this story features text spoken in multiple languages I'll denote the spoken language with () before each line\n\nLet's introduce our characters for this tale, shall we?\n\n&gt; $FT: Friendly Tech - Tech support that gets sent out by $SP to fix issues customers have or install new software updates  \n&gt; $GC: Grumpy Customer - Doesn't understand why he even has to pay for software  \n&gt; $AA: Annoying Assistant - When in doubt, the boss is always right!\n\nThe weather was sunny and the road clear. $FT was pretty happy - $SP had recently released an update to $software and so he was sent out to customers far and wide to bring them ~~gifts of joy~~ a new version of $software. This time around he had to go to $GC known for expertly wielding profanities, as $FT recalled from his time when he was working as a mere level 1 helpdesk ~~monkey~~ support. He started his journey at 6AM driving around 4 hours to finally get to the customer.  \nArriving on-site and $GC was already waiting with $AA.\n\n&gt; $FT: (Common) [INSERT DEFAULT GREETING]. I'm here to update you to the latest version of $software.  \n&gt; $GC: (Common) Ah, great that you're here! The PC with $software installed is right over here!\n\nNeedless to say $FT was more than a bit surprised - it seemed $GC was one of those customers that bark but don't bite. While he followed $GC to the PC, $GC was having a conversation with $AA.\n\n&gt; $GC: (Troll) That dumbf@#* is finally here. It's already 10AM - doesn't he know some people have to work!  \n&gt; $AA: (Troll) And as always when $SP updates $software everything goes to sh@# all the time!  \n&gt; $GC: (Troll) I don't get why we have to pay that much for this piece of cr%@ $software!\n\n$FT continued to the PC and not even an hour later $software was updated, he had checked that the printer worked and it properly backed up to the customers local backup solution. While he was doing so $GC and $AA continued cursing him and $SP.  \n\n&gt; $GC: (Troll) I bet those suckers at $SP told him to take his time with updating $software and doing all kinds of unnecessary sh%# so they can charge even more for this!  \n&gt; $AA: (Troll) Why did he have to check the printer as well? It *always* works without any issues!\n\nBear in mind that $GC like many other clients of $SP regularly called in because their stuff is broken. $FT had already helped fix their *always working* printer back in his days at helpdesk.\n\n&gt; $FT: (Common) Anything else I can help you with?  \n&gt; $GC: (Common) No, thank you very much!  \n&gt; $FT: (Troll) Good! I'll be taking my leave. Have a *wonderful* day.  \n\nIt was at this moment $GC and $AA realized they had fucked up - majorly. While $FT did not look like it, he was half troll and even his last name was a typical troll name. As such he also spoke troll natively. With a grin on his face $FT left the premise. The rumors from helpdesk said that $GC had become a rather 'tame' customer after this whole incident. While $SP did not give one single f about how their helpdesk or technicians were treated, if word reached them that a customer talked sh#$ about them, they were dropped like a hot potato. \n\nTL;DR: Customer thought he could talk sh#$ about the company and the tech in another language for nearly an hour while the tech was native in said language.\n\nEdit: Spelling. Also *stability improvements*. ",

        "text": "So this happened today, let's start off with a bit of background. The company I work for has 2 racks in a co-location data centre (D and E) and they both have the same code back and front (So 1234 for all the rack doors, not the actual code but I like my job) and both racks have a 4U storage server at the bottom. All will become relevant very soon.\n\nI get told to go downstairs and pull a specific cable out of the storage server in rack D. So I went down and unlocked rack E thinking it was rack D. I sit down to look at the server and look for any identifying marks to tell me what cable to unplug (I was told management port on controller 0 I was trying to identify which was 0) there was no identifying marks what so ever not even to identify from device A to device B.\n\nSo I tell my colleagues to keep an eye on the monitoring software and tell me if I unplug the wrong controller but I think it's this one as there no traffic going through it and the reason we were unplugging and re plugging was due to the controller being frozen.\n\nI finally unplug the cable and wait, nothing from my colleagues so I'm pretty happy I unplugged the correct one. I plug it back in and go to check if the controller has come back when I realise I don't have my laptop so I go back upstairs and check but the controller still isn't working.\n\nThis time I take my laptop with me and unplug the server while looking at the GUI waiting for it to tell me link down but I refresh the page, link up so I refresh again, link up and do this multiple times I've the next 10 minutes but then also notice something else, the controller are showing management and port 1 as up on both controllers but only the first controller has a cable in port 1. At this point I realise something is truly screwed with this server.\n\nI walk back upstairs and talk about it with my senior engineer and tell him about all these problems and spend 10 minutes discussing it and this is the first time I start doubting myself and check monitoring to see if anything else went down while doing this but nope nothing and I was pretty sure it was the right server.\n\nAfter doubting myself I have to go down and check and it was at this point that that I realise my mistake so I message my senior engineer letting him know and complete the work on the correct server and saw the link go down almost as soon as I unplug it and back up when I plug it back in.\n\nTL;DR make sure you know what your unplugging and hope you don't unplug a live production server",

        "text": "Back to my time offshore. In this case, this was very, VERY early in my offshore career. This is in around 1997 or so. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur setup at this time included a data collection machine that collected data to a 9gb hard drive and a data processing machine that was also the fileserver and backup station. The processing machine had 27gb or so of  space in a software RAID... three data drives and a parity drive. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe data collector could fill up that 9gb drive in two to three days. Due to storage capacity limitations, we had a policy of archiving the raw data as soon as possible. Every two to three days, I would copy all the data from the collection machine to the processing machine, archive the latest raw data to tape, process the raw data into a smaller processed form, then delete the raw data. Once the raw data was on tape, I would then delete the raw data off of the data collection machine. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn one fateful day, I'm asked to dump the contents of a data CD to our \"RAID array\". I had just finished processing the last dump and had just archived raw data and cleaned off the collection machine. This was a very lucky thing. I ran the command to copy the entire disc to the RAID array and went to the galley to grab a bite to eat. I came back from lunch to see it still crunching away on the disc, which was very odd. About 45 minutes into the copy process, the processing machine crashed. This was also unusal. I had witnessed maybe two workstation crashes. The machine comes back up, but the data drive is not mounted. Hmm... That's not good. I attempt to run an fsck on the data drive, and I get an error from the RAID software that set0 has no members or some such ( I forget the exact error ). After an hour or so of reading manuals and trying everything to resurrect this drive, I admit defeat and call the office. They put me in touch with the local \"expert\" in recovering software RAIDs. We try several things and after a few hours, he admits defeat. We are now 8ish hours into this mess and about 4 hours after my shift is over. At this point, not only do I have to worry about getting everything up and running before the data collection machine runs out of space, I also need to have processed data so that we can see which areas need more data collected. For reasons that I will never fully understand, it took another twelve hours or so to actually rebuild the software RAID. Now I need to pull data from my latest full backup, which I completed a few hours before the crash. The restore took another 8ish hours. Then I had to pull data from the CD again, but this time I pulled the data across the network from a PC with a cdrom drive. That took another two hours. Then I started processing the last batch of raw data ( I had lost that data ). That took another 6 hours. Now, I need to hurry up and pull the data across from the collection machine, archive it to tape, clean off the data collection machine before it runs out of space, and process the latest batch of raw data. This took another 6 hours. I don't know if I have the math all done correctly, but I basically had to stay up and fight with this disaster for 48 hours straight. When I finally had everything caught up, cleaned up, backed up, and ready to go... I crashed for about 24 hours straight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\--\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis was not the only time I wiped out a workstation. Again, early in my career, I discovered that operating a vacuum cleaner on the same circuit that the workstation was plugged into was enough to crash the workstation. At least that time, I didn't take out the RAID array. \\*sigh\\* ",

        "text": "Cross posted from r/talesfromcallcenters\n\nHey all, story time of a fun little call I had a couple weeks back from a lady who was the equivalent of a “can I speak to your manager” haircut, personified. \n\nI’ve posted on here a couple times before, the company I work for makes software that is for body shops and dealerships, so depending on the day I may get spammed with really nice people who “don’t really know how to use a computer, but can you please help me” or people that just need a password reset or forgot a username. This call was one of those hellacious calls where I resisted the urge to lose my cool several times over. We’re gonna call her “cust” because otherwise I’ll think of something much more rude to call her. \n\nMe: “customer support, this is X”\n\nCust: “You need to help me use ‘the link’” (our software program)\n\nMe: “Sure! Have you used it before, or have you watched any of the self help videos in our support section? Was there something specific with it you had questions on?”\n\nCust: (Begins to actually scream into the phone): “I don’t have time for this, I don’t know how to use the link and you need to help me right now and stop asking me questions!”\n\nMe: “Ma’am, I am trying to help you, but I’m trying to figure out if you ever used the link before, or if you’re a first time user. Please do not raise your voice to me, as I am simply trying to help.”\n\nCust: (Starts yelling even louder): “I AM NOT YELLING AT YOU. YOU NEED TO HELP ME OR GET ME YOUR MANAGER.”\n\nMe: “Ma’am, you haven’t told me what the problem is, how am I supposed to help if I don’t know what you need?”\nCust: “I told you, I don’t know how to use the link and you need to help me!”\n\n(At this point I assume she’s either a first time user or someone who hasn’t used it in a long time, so I prepare to remote in and give her a full walkthrough of the program.)\n\nMe: “Okay, can I get your account’s phone number so I can pull up your profile? I’m going to remote in to help you.”\n\nCust: “Finally! It’s 800-FUC-KOFF.” (She didn’t say that, but damn was I thinking it.)\n\n(At this point I pull up their account see they’re pretty active, having called in a couple weeks ago for assistance with files not pulling through the link. We also just released a major update to our software so older windows versions like XP and vista are no longer supported.)\n\nMe: (walks her through the steps of remoting me in, which normally takes 30-60 seconds tops, and takes us nearly 10 minutes.) “Okay, so I’m in, you have the link installed and running, so what seems to be the problem? You said you didn’t know how to use it at all, but you have it installed on here.” (Her PC is also slower than hell and looks to be running vista, if the 10 minutes to remote in didn’t clue you in.)\n\nCust: “It won’t work! I tried to send a file over but it won’t come into the website and you need to fix it for me!”\n\nMe: “So, when you said you didn’t know how to use the system what you really meant is you knew how, but you couldn’t get a file through...?”\n\nCust: (Her tone suddenly changes as I trail off and let her sit there and think of how much of an idiot she’s being.) “Oh yeah, silly me that’s what I meant! It’s worked up until the last week or so! Btw, where are you located, how’s the weather out there?” (I shit you not, she went to stepford wife cheerful at the drop of a hat. Also, our update came out about a week ago, hmmm.)\n\nMe: “Okay, so we did have an update come out about a week ago, did you happen to download and install it? It would have prompted you to do so.”\n\nCust: “YES. SO TELL ME WHY IT ISNT WORKING.” (Just like that, back to rude and snarky.)\n\nMe: “Let me check a couple things -goes through basic verification steps I normally would have done before wasting my time to remote in, she answers okay to all of them-do you happen to know what version of windows you use?”\n\nCust: “No, I don’t know that, that shouldn’t matter at all.”\n\nMe: “Actually it does, we upgraded the program so some versions are no longer supported.” (I then check the version of our tool and it isn’t the latest one.) “Okay, so you didn’t actually download the newest version of the tool, so that’s why it isn’t actually working.”\n\nI go through the brief process of updating our tool, and lo and behold, it fails and says the operating system isn’t supported.\n\nCust: “That’s weird, we use vista so I don’t know why it wouldn’t work.”\n\nMe: “You just said you didn’t know which version you used, and if so, that’s why it isn’t working anymore. “ (I check the system info, it’s fucking vista.) “Sorry ma’am, your pc has an unsupported version of windows for our program, due to our recent software upgrade. I’d suggest upgrading the pc as a whole as opposed to just installing the new OS. But I can’t fix this for you because it won’t work with our tool anymore!”\n\nCust: (Starts swearing at a man in the background and yells at him to upgrade the pc because it’s too old and she needs to use our program.)\n\nThat was a satisfying end to the call, sorry lady, but even if I wanted to help you, and at this point I definitely didn’t, I couldn’t. \n",

Now onto the story.\n\n​\n\nI work as primarily as a developer, but often also as a tech support guy, since I am the newest dev here.\n\nI work for a company that is primary a web store, but we also have wood and brick stores, or what counts for them today inside shopping centers and we have a custom POS for them that is web based. It has connections to web front end, to apps and certain other things so it can do all kinds of things, but the problem as always are  .... users ...\n\n​\n\nSo onto the story. We have a special feature for the web store where you can enable certain clients to purchase up to user defined amount of products for free every X days. The HQ has been using this for a while, but one of the newer stores just started using this feature. I being the dashing and helpful dev helped them set it up and explained how the feature worked. After confirming that they knew what they were doing I let them be and got back to my regular work, so yesteday I got an email from them going something like this. $me = Me, $manager = manager of the new store.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nEmail\n\n​\n\nHello, $me\n\n​\n\nthe feature that you set up for us to give some items away for free is not working, when we tried to use it we got a bill and now we do not know what to do. Please do fix it, I thought you said this works already...\n\n​\n\n$manager\n\n​\n\n​\n\nSo since I was busy with other work yesterday I didn't manage to look at the issue till today. First I tried the feature on localhost, then on dev server and it worked everywhere, I checked version control system and everything was up to date ... Hmmm, what could it be? So I went to check the logs ... Aaaand there it was. They created the bill at 12:15 while they set up the feature at 12:30 ... So I responded back kindly.\n\n​\n\nHello $manager,\n\n​\n\nI have seen that you have set up the feature, but the feature needs to be set up before you start using it. Unfortunately since you already created the bill and sent it to your tax ministry you will need to send  cancellation to your tax ministry for this bill and then use the feature.\n\n​\n\nRegards $me\n\n​\n\nHopefully that will be enough.

        "text": "LTL;FTP\n\nToday I'll be telling you a small story. I must preface it by assuring everyone that it takes place in Mexico, and thus there's no such thing as HIPAA. \n\nThere's a small cast, as follows:\nMy friend, nameless here.\nHer dad, happens to be a medical doctor.\nHer brother, services medical machines.\nA random attendant, she operates a small internet near the hospital.\nMe, a decidedly non-IT guy known for figuring out ways to make everything work out alright.\n\nA couple weeks ago, my friend crashed sometime near midnight and was admitted, unconscious and by ambulance, to the states primary hospital. She did not have insurance, and, in fact, getting anyone to know required the cop who responded to the crash to post her ID all over Facebook with hopes that someone would recognize her. I did and was the first to arrive on scene, just after informing her parents. \n\nSo, scene set, it's the next day and she seems stable, but given the lack of insurance, her tests, specifically a tomography, could not be released to her parents, and it being a state operated hospital, visitation rights were scarce. However, her brother happens to work maintenance on medical machines, so he managed to get a CD with her tests to show their dad and decide on their course of action. Of course, the dad won't be leaving the hospital, so I volunteer to go to the internet a block over and try to convert the proprietary software images into something that can be shared by whatsapp and/or viewed on a phone. \n\nSo I enter the place and am met with three very basic desktops, I ask the attendant which one has a CD drive and she tells me it's the first one, but that it's \"broken\". I try to ask around, figure out what's wrong with it, but she can only say it won't stay on. So I figure I need that one to work, and she can use it better if it does, so I offer that if I fix it she can let me use it for free, and she happily accepts.\n\nTurn it on, it seems alright at first, but when I start typing on the old, clunky keyboard, weird things happen. It then hits me, and I press an arrow while on the desktop, and the screen freezes and turns. I try the ages old method of pressing every single modifier key a couple times, then start typing again. Lo and behold, problem's fixed. So I call her over, show her which keys to press and get loose whenever the problem starts again, and I'm on my way to get those images.\n\nI do the needfull and finally have the pictures as I need them. Then comes the big problem. I can't connect my phone to the PC cause there is no cable, no bluetooth, and the attendant sadly doesn't know the WiFi password, as the WPS is supposed to work (it doesn't). So I try to upload it to my dropbox and the rate is abyssmal: nearly an hour to upload about 1 minute of content (I converted each set to a small 20 fps video, total 6 sets). I'm looking at the screen, wondering what to do, when the light bulb turns on. I ask her: \"Do you want the WiFi password?\" She says the owner doesn't know it, so I tell her, that I'll exchange it to her for a bag of chips (sold there). She says to go for it. \n\nNow, some of you may know of the wonderful tool known as wirelesskeyview, and as I'd noticed the computers happened to be connected over WiFi and not cable, well, I quickly ran it and jotted down the password, connected my phone, shared the files over FTP, and promptly gave her the paper and told her to try it. She connected her phone, looked at me and said \"it's not everyday that I get customers as interesting as you.\"\n\nAnd this, my dear readers, is the tale of how I got myself a free bag of Ruffles and an awesome ego boost while fixing a random estabilishment's PC.",

I called him up and said, \"Hello, this is \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ from \\*\\*\\*\\* support. I'm calling in regards to case ####.\" He tells me that his scanner isn't working and not taking the paper when he puts it in the tray. I also asked if he tried plugging the device into another system and he told me that plugging the device into another usb port won't work because he already tried it. I asked him again if he's using our software and even questioned whether or not he's using the WIA drivers because how else is he scanning? Our software works with the simplex and duplex button so...? He replies back that nothing works and it's faulty. I was a bit puzzled by his response because I ran through the process of \"giving him the answer to his issue and hanging up\" method of call center. So I remoted into the computer and he had Windows 10, right clicked on the windows icon and went to apps and features. I wanted to see if the software was there and it was, but when he would scan, it tells him that scanner isn't connected. I did notice that the scanner was there in both apps and device manager. I ran the removal tools for our software and it still didn't work. I finally went to modify his scanner download in apps and features, only to be greeted with a quick poof of the driver as soon as I clicked on it. He never had the driver downloaded after all.   \n So I had to download the driver from the website. He was already getting angry because nothing was working and I told him that I'm trying the best I can and I want to complete the process without any draw backs. He begins to tell me that I'm a horrible technician and how I shouldn't be taking this long. Keep in mind that this guy is an IT person as well. I ended up telling him that we can RMA the scanner because we do keep running into the same issue that he's getting. I asked him if he had a warranty and he went on this rant about how the system we use to find the warranty is messed up and it's my fault for making it this messed up. At that point I didn't say anything, but the simple line - \\*5 second pause\\* \"let me transfer you to the customer service department so I can file an RMA for you. Let me finish up my notes and I'll transfer you, sir.\"  He was asking me if he needed a receipt or the warranty expired a year after the purchase date.  I told him that our CS dept can answer the question and that I don't want to give him any wrong information. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhew ! This is the first job I got in the call center after being laid off as network administrator in May. The reason I'm in this call center is because I feel if I don't get this experience, I won't get the full IT career bojangles of the job.  I'm also pursuing a degree still at a ripe age of 28. I'm almost there ! \n\n\\*\\* If you're wondering what scanner it is, it's a Xerox 3115 scanner without the docking station. \\*\\*",

Now you may say, what's the problem, just check the inventory. Except the PC's don't have inventory numbers. Yes you heard that right, a multi billion euro project with hundreds of employees, hundreds of computers, doesn't give each device a unique identifier. Instead, they give each machine's network number a simple code (desktop or laptop)-username.\n\nSo you guessed where this is going, when people quit, get a new machine etc. It's a giant mess. I may also note that those aren't some shitty high school laptops, but Dell T7000 series workstations with Intel Xeons and Nvidia Quadros. The number of \"missing machines\" has thus risen; from a dozen last year, to over 50 this year already.\n\nSo a number of machines are probably stolen, others may just be laying around under some desk waiting to be found...\n\nTL;DR: multi billion euro project's tech support doesn't give Dell 7000 workstations inventory number, more and more computers missing.\n",

Basically, he accidentally formatted it - don't ask me how.\n\nSo, his secretary called me one day, and asked whether I would take a request for a personal favor from her boss - which is not something you don't at least listen to, coming from a board member of a rather large company. Long story short, it was an easy thing - Recuva brought back all 800GB of his familiy photos. Stuff like photos from their son's first communion, old scanned documents from their ancestors, lots of family photos - basically, scans of their whole family history spanning over 100 years.\n\nHow do I know what that data was? After the recovery, the (quite teary-eyed, I have to say) senior executive invited me for coffee in his office. He gave me a box of very, very good and also very, very expensive Spanish red wine, together with a nice thank-you-card signed by him and his wife, and told me that the disk was the only copy of those photos that still existed in their family after their house burned down a few months earlier.\n\nHe also told me, that I probably saved his marriage by bringing back those pictures - I still don't know to this day whether he was joking or not :)",

        "text": "Brief context. I'm tech support for a POS software. We serve several clients in different parts of the US, and basic 8-5pm support is included in everybody's contract. You also get 24/7 support if you decide later if you want to be added to that, which means you'll get assistance from whoever's on call for after hours.\n\nOne of the businesses we support ($TourGroup) is led by a rather strange, perpetually displeased young woman that we'll call $Cersei.\n\n$TourGroup used to be led by a slightly older lady who, while not the most tech savvy, was always polite and kind when dealing with us to fix her stuff. We never had very many problems with her personally - our only issue with $TourGroup was the fact that NONE of their employees seemed to be able to follow basic instructions or remember basic processes. Most of their calls were helping them with quick annoying stuff, but they were usually very appreciative.\n\nWhen the other lady stepped down and $Cersei became the head of the business....things changed. Here's a few things to keep in mind:\n\n* $Cersei does not and has never liked working with our support team. We haven't been able to figure out why. She will put in tickets about \"critical\" issues, but then never follow up on them even when responded to. She regularly dips out of scheduled calls to remote in. She reschedules several times and often doesn't show up for the remote session. She will put in tickets, then immediately email our manager before anyone has even seen the ticket yet to complain that we're taking too long to resolve her issue. She gets angry when we suggest any kind of troubleshooting step. Basically, if it involves working with us to any extent, she quickly gets upset and tries to escalate. \n* $Cersei relies on her in-house IT team for EVERYTHING. Remember what I said above about her not wanting to talk to the support team? Yep - if she has to troubleshoot ANYTHING or provide more information other than \"it's broken\", she assigns one of her in-house IT who barely know the software to the ticket and orders us to work together while she goes off to do god knows what. It's frustrating for her IT people because she gives them just about as much info as she gives us. Also, none of them are very familiar with what the software is supposed to do or shouldn't be doing, so the blind is frequently leading the blind.\n* $Cersei has also been known to just plop one of her other employees on the phone with us when she decides she doesn't want to speak with us. Said employee often has only a very vague idea of what's going on. Blind leading the blind, once more.\n* $Cersei likes escalating. I think she gets high off of it. \n\nOn to the story. This story in particular is what essentially brought my manager to the decision of looking a bit more critically at their contract.\n\nLast year, $TourGroup had been having a lot of issues with being able to perform refunds in the POS software. Which is a valid concern.\n\n$Cersei put in a ticket titled \"Unable to swipe cards\" Explaining that they were having issues swiping credit cards and to please call as it is a huge inconvenience. \n\nActually, she never did put in an actual ticket. She **emailed our manager directly** a few days prior and our manager made a ticket for her. She has been told repeatedly that this is not the best way to get support. \n\nI took the ticket. Asked some follow up questions, mainly questions about how to reproduce the issue, if it was happening for all computers, if there was an error, what kind of swipers they were using, ect. I also reached out by phone, but only got her voicemail. $Cersei, of course, wasn't happy.\n\n&gt;$Cersei: I don't have time for all of this, please just give us a call so we can get this resolved ASAP. This is affecting our business. \n\nSo, I try again to call, but it just went to voicemail. Noted this in the ticket and asked $Cersei if she possibly had a better number where I could reach her. She doesn't reply...for three or four days, even with repeated attempts to contact her. Along with the troubleshooting questions I needed to so much as guess at what might be going on.\n\nTicket closed for inactivity after four days, per protocol. End of story, right?\n\nNope. She emails back on the ticket - with her IT people suddenly CC'ed on the email chain.\n\n&gt;$Cersei: When the card is sitting there normally, it shows a green light. When we swipe a card, the light goes out and doesn't show the information in the screen. We replaced it with a new one, but we're still getting the same issue. I think the swipers are black but ordered from you guys.\n\n(Just as a side note, we don't support, manufacture, or sell the swipers. But we DO tell people which swipers to order when they first sign on with us based on what payment processor they're using. The swipers they ordered didn't come from us - they would have been ordered by $TourGroup. In this case, we're trained to send them to the manufacturer first.)\n\nBut it finally looks like we're getting somewhere. I cheerfully reply. \n\n&gt;$Drej: Hi, $Cersei! Thanks for following up. We unfortunately do not support or manufacture credit card swipers - those would have been ordered by $TourGroup and are supported by $Manufacturer. It looks like this is an issue related to the swiper hardware itself rather than $Software. I'd contact them first to troubleshoot. \\*gives contact info\\*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$Cersei: The machines are not swiping. I would like to set up a call with $SoftwareCompany and $TourGroupIT to get this sorted TODAY.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$Drej: I am unfortunately not going to be available for a call today, but I'd be happy to schedule a call with you tomorrow at X time. Could you or your IT provide the following information? -insert troubleshooting/necessary info here-\n\n$TourGroupIT replies with the answers to my questions. So far so good. I email $Cersei again to see if she was able to confirm a date for a call the next day.\n\n&gt;$Cersei: This has gone on for too long. Get me the contact information for your supervisor.\n\nLong story short, the ticket is escalated, our manager basically tells $Cersei (gently) why we ask the troubleshooting questions that we do, why we're trying to schedule a call to resolve the issue, ect. Cersei is of course kind and polite to our manager, if whiny as she complains that we \"take too long\" to resolve her issues. Her entire reply to our manager is this screechy rant about she's had nothing but problems with our software and how our support is \"terrible and slow\" and she doesn't feel like her problems are getting handled quickly enough.\n\nThe issue was resolved, though - someone had messed up the swiper configuration. Of course, even determining what exactly the issue was required us to spend over two hours on the phone with her IT because again, Queen $Cersei can't be arsed to be on a call to tell us what the software isn't doing that it should, or what it's doing that it shouldn't.\n\n$Cersei also still emails our manager directly for most things. She's also currently on our lowest, trashiest, break-iest version of the software because she refuses to upgrade because \"our upgrades break everything\". \n\nTL;DR: User thinks our support team is awful and that we're slow, even though she's unwilling to communicate or work with us and gets frustrated easily when encouraged to troubleshoot.

        "text": "I'm an IT in the military and this particular issue takes place while out to sea. We had been having some issues tracking down assets that people had been moving around the ship. So someone would walk into a room, see a computer and decide that it would look better in their work space. This is obviously a hassle, because we have to keep very strict documentation of where things are installed throughout the ship. While out to sea we work 12 hour shifts of basically Help Desk. Answer a phone and ask \"Have you tired turning it off and on again?\". Repeat. \n\n\nI get up one morning and feel incredibly not ready for the day. Once in my shop, one of my fellow IT's comes up to me and begins explaining that he found a better way of finding these moved computers. Most of what he says kind of goes in one ear and out the other. I sit my desk and get start going through my emails. \n\n\nThe phone rings suddenly and I mentally prepare myself for whatever it could be. \n\n&gt; $Kraken: IT2 Kraken speaking, how may I help you Sir, Ma'am, or Chief?\n\n&gt; $User: For some reason the computer in my space won't let me log on.\n\nNow I could walk them through describing the problem to me, but because I'm such a small ship I could just walk over there in that time. I arrive on the scene and immediately I realize the issue. \n\n*The log on server could not be reached*\n\nCool. I crawl under the desk and see that the Ethernet cable is still plugged in. Hmm, alright lets check out some other stuff. I boot into the BIOS and check to see if the computer sees a connection. And it does... Great. I log on to the machine with my admin rights and see that the computer has no IP. Weird. The adaptor settings are for DHCP. Maybe there is an issue there? I try to explain to the user that the next steps for me fixing it have to be done in my shop and that I would be right back. \n\n\nOnce back in my shop, all hell has broken loose. Everyone is running around and scrambling to get **our** computers fixed. Turns out while I was troubleshooting that one machine, a large majority of computers on the network started showing the same symptoms. I suggest assigning a static IP on a test computer to see if that fixes the issue. Sure enough the computer jumps back on the domain no problem... I immediately use the computer to remote into my DHCP server and start digging through event viewer and logs. There is nothing to suggest that there is an issue here. I start going through updates and looking up KB to see if one of these updates broke my server. I spent the next 6 hours trying everything. In the meantime we have to go to each computer that is having an issue and assigning a static IP. \n\nThe next day, we release an email to everyone saying that computers are dropping off the network likes flies, and if you have an issue call the IT's so can document and fix the issue. We pass an announcement over the 1MC (Like a PA system for the ship) describing the symptoms and to call us if you have issues. I'm researching like crazy, googling everything I can think of to find an answer. Around Hour 5 of Day 2 I call the Navy's Tech Support for Tech Support. The guy I'm talking to is trying to walk me through the basic troubleshooting steps I've already taken, I don't blame him. While we talk on the phone, I'm still digging through DHCP. And then I find it. There, in the filters I see MAC Address Whitelist and Blacklist... Someone had blacklisted two of the computers we had been trying to find... But they had also enabled whitelisting... And not put a single address in the list. I was shocked. Who did this? \n\n\nI inform the Tech Supports Tech Support that we can close the ticket and I had fixed the issue. I hang up and sit there for a second. What had that guy told me yesterday? I wait until the evening shift gets up to relieve us, and I ask him.\n\n\n&gt; $IT1: Oh yeah, I blocked those two computers so whenever someone tries to log on, they would have to call us.\n\n&gt; $Kraken: Did you... block it in DHCP?\n\n&gt; $IT1: Yeah, Why?.... Oh...\n\n&gt; $Kraken: Yeah.\n\n\nI explain what he did wrong and we fixed the issue. However, we now had to go back to every computer and set them back to pull IP's automatically... At least we found those two computers...\n\n\n\nTLDR; A fellow IT created a whitelist filter on DHCP without listing any MAC address. Killed whole network.\n",

I don't know $Random_app well, mind if I remote control your PC and have a look?  \n&gt; $U : sure, no problem.  \n\nSo I remote in and see the $random_app's login screen opened in $U's browser.\n\n$U starts typing her password and sure enough, at some point the password field on the log in form suddenly gets empty. I do notice however that the whole page has flickered once when that happened. Thus, I ask:\n\n&gt;$Me : Did you insert a special character in your new password? Mind if I ask which one?  \n&gt;$U : Yes, F5  \n&gt;$Me : Huh, do you mean F5 as the function key?  \n&gt;$U : Yes. It works without issue when I open my Windows session.\n\nCue me explaining to $U that F5 isn't a character but a function key, and while it does absolutely nothing on most program windows, it triggers a page refresh when in a web browser, which will usually empty all fields :)\n\n",

        "text": "I've had a couple salesmen ask me for custom programming, which is part of my job. No problem, since I want the company as a whole to save time doing things and have usable information that help them make decisions quickly. They want a certain report for only one of their customers, so we meet, I do the programming, send them a test report, and never hear from them again. After all that time I put into it the project is dead.\n\nSo now when they ask me to do custom programming for a sales person, I ask them to give me screen shots of every screen in the software that runs our company, that shows the data they want. This helps me find where the data is in the database (the table and field), and makes them commit some of their time into it before I commit my time. I want to know if they are serious or not about this. \n\nAlso, during busy times, any sales projects go to the very bottom of the pile to be done last. What this means is it could be 2-3 months before I even touch their project or look at it. I think they received my message loud and clear. \n\nNow, only salesmen who are reliable and will actually use their custom report call me. Problem solved!\n\nTLDR: 2 salesmen want me to put in a lot of time for their custom projects, then when the projects are done, totally abandon them.",

        "text": "I'm based offshore on an oil platform and printer toner is locked in a cupboard, the reason we don't let regular users replace the toner is that they somehow always manage to fuck it up each time and an engineer can take weeks if its really broken, plus we need to make note of our stock levels as they never tell us when one is used and it takes days for new toner to arrive via boat.\n\nWell of course the nighshift would grab the key to the cupboard when I wasnt there and I'd only realise when I went in to get a toner cartridge and see that we're low. I put a notice up saying 'if you take any toner please inform IT so we can update our stock sheet' but nope that didn't work, toner still going missing, wake up to notes on my desk saying the printers are fucked etc. \n\nTo catch them I created a fake sign out form and stuck it on a clipboard in the stock cupboard with a pen, it asked people to write their name, date/time and what toner was taken, basically they were signing their own confession that they were taking toner and also coincided with the printer logs when the printer fucked up. The list was passed to the manager and I didn't have any problems after that.",

I think the computer was like $17,000.  Among his regular work, this guy was also creating AutoCAD drawings for the CEO's house to remodel.\n\nOne day, the computer crashed and the OS had to be reinstalled. \n Now, we had backups for every computer (when it worked, but that's another story) but only for the user profile.  This guy saved the CEO's drawings to a folder in the root, something like C:\\Projects.  \n\nAdditionally, he had 2 large SSDs as the primary, but were I think RAID0, essentially making it like 1 bad hard drive, instead of RAID1, for backup (if I got the RAID numbers mixed up, let me know and I'll correct it).\n\nIn the end we had to ship off the hard drives to a data recovery service (not sure how much they saved), an email went out making sure everyone knew to *only* save to their user profile, but we all changed the backup settings to include this guy's entire C: drive.",

        "text": "Cast:\n\n**$hyacinth** \\- Me\n\n**$user**\\- A new-ish employee\n\n​\n\nThis takes place during my consulting days. The client company in this case was notoriously stingy- they didn't like spending money on anything. But, they hired a new employee and that meant they had to buy him a brand new PC. I set it up and everyone was happy for a few months. Then one morning $user flagged me down...\n\n​\n\n&gt;**$user:** Hey, $hyacinth! I'm getting this weird error every time I turn my computer on.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**$hyacinth**: Ok, let me take a look at it.\n\n​\n\nIt's a dll error (this was a Windows 7 PC, if I remember correctly). Odd to have startup dll errors on a brand new machine, but things happen. I ran the startup repair utility while $user took his lunch and the error was, seemingly, resolved. Two months later:\n\n​\n\n&gt;**$user**: $Hyacinth, that error is back. Every time I turn on my computer I get that same error message as last time!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**$hyacinth**: Hm, that's not good. You shouldn't be getting startup errors- your PC is new. I'll run the repair utility again, but if it keeps happening I may need to reinstall the OS.\n\n​\n\nI ran the startup repair again, and again the error was apparently fixed. \"What the hell is causing these errors?\", I thought. \"I'd really rather not have to rebuild this PC since the company will definitely not want to approve the billable hours for the work\". I hoped against hope that the dll error wouldn't come back. Alas, about a month later...\n\n​\n\n&gt;**$user**: (walks over to me) The error is back!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**$hyacinth**: /sigh.\n\n​\n\n\"Maybe it's not the same error,\" I thought as I followed $user back to his desk. I asked him to show me the error, but he'd already dismissed it.\n\n​\n\n&gt;**$hyacinth**: I want to make sure that it's the same error before I commit to reinstalling your OS. Can you please reboot so I can see the error message when the PC comes back up?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**$user**: Sure.\n\n​\n\nAnd then $user did something...unexpected. Strange. He started to reach under his desk, towards the PC tower. \"Why is he doing that?\" I thought. $user extended his first finger, aiming at the power button. I suddenly realized his goal.\n\n​\n\n&gt;**$hyacinth**: Wait! Whoa whoa whoa! You don't need to force the computer off. It's still responsive. I just need you to reboot it.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**$user**: \\*deer in headlights look\\* ... \\*reaches towards power button again\\*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**$hyacinth**: No no no! Don't hit the power button. Just reboot it the normal way.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**$user**: \\*looks at power button, then looks at me\\* Pushing the power button isn't how you turn the computer off?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA heavenly choir sang as the source of $user's startup errors became clear. He had been force powering off his computer EVERY NIGHT for months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;**$hyacinth**: No, $user. I'll show you how to do it the usual way. Go to the little Windows icon in the bottom left corner....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI showed him how to shut down his computer properly. He had no further complaints of startup issues for the remainder of my time working for that company.\n\n​\n\nTL;DR: User habitually force powered off his computer which caused startup file errors. Showed user how to turn off his computer correctly. Problem solved.",

        "text": "So the company I work for was bought out by another company. So we have two separate usernames we have to keep track of while our all our applications migrate from one system to the other. Company 1(C1) will be the main company that bought out my company, which I'll call Company 2(C2).\n\nSo I get this middle aged plus guy on the phone who is supposed to be the head of security for an entire building somewhere in Arizona and he tells me he's having trouble logging into one of C2's applications. His tone of voice throughout the call gives off the impression that he's in this perpetual state of confusion and just overwhelmed by everything. He starts up a long, slow rant about being computer illiterate and how this migration has \"ruined everything\" and made everything so hard; meanwhile I tune him out and check out his account in active directory and find it's locked. I go through the whole spiel for unlocking it and tell him to try again as soon as I reach a pause in his rant. Problem solved, right?\n\nNope. He still can't log in. I verified that he was in fact using C2's username and that it wasn't working, and he confirmed he was. Alright, time to assume user error.\n\n&gt;**Me:** Okay, so describe to me what the sign in screen looks like.\n\n&gt;**Him:** It's the internet log in. I can't log into the internet.\n\n&gt;**Me:** I thought you were having trouble logging into the C2 application...?\n\n&gt;**Him:** Well yeah, because I can't log into the internet.\n\nI sighed out loud on mute. It's a tortured, drawn out sound. You know the one.\n\nIf you don't know, with anyone middle-aged and older the word \"internet\" can mean numerous things. It could mean he can't connect to the WiFi, it could mean the VPN, or it could mean any one of the numerous web applications that require login, most notably C1's home page that recently supplanted the one used by C2. I guess I should at least count myself lucky he didn't just use the word, \"computer\" for everything.\n\nI took a guess.\n\n&gt;**Me:** Okay, so does it say C1 Network Login on the page?\n\n&gt;**Him:** Yeah, I think so...\n\n&gt;**Me:** Okay, you're on the C1 home page, you actually want to use C1UserID here to log in.\n\n&gt;**Him:** Oh. So C1UserID is the password.\n\nI winced as if struck. He literally thought the *word* C1UserID was the password, rather than his actual C1UserID which would have been a combo of his last name and first and middle initials. It took a minute or two to walk him through what I meant. I remind you this guy proclaimed himself head of security for an entire goddamn facility. \n\nHe grumbled about how that was confusing and didn't make sense, but managed to log into the C1 homepage managing to put the C1UserID in the UserID field.. He had no problem getting to the C2 application from there, and so I had him try logging in again. What do you know, he still can't. Account still unlocked. No invalid password attempts recorded.\n\n&gt;**Me:** Okay, I want to verify something here. What UserID are you using.\n\n&gt;**Him:** C1UserID.\n\n&gt;**Me:** No. You want to actually be using C2UserID.\n\nHe started making this strangled noise and seemed to stumble on his thoughts before choking out something resembling a sentence.\n\n&gt;**Him:** But you just told me to use C1UserID.\n\n&gt;**Me:** For the home page, because that's a C1 website. C2 Application is still with C2, so it still uses C2UserID.\n\n&gt;**Him**: I'm confused. There are so many usernames now, I can't keep it straight. This doesn't make sense. It's—\n\nI cut him off before he spiral any further, I was starting to get frustrated.\n\n&gt;**Me:** There are two. *Two* UserIDs. One for Company 1, one for Company 2. C1UserID is used for programs that have moved to the C1 side of the system. This application is still on the C2 side of the system though, so it still uses C2UserID. The one you use for your computer login?\n\nHe seemed to get what I was saying, and managed to type it out. Still no dice. I quizzed him a bit and figured out he was using Chrome. I had him switch to IE—for some reason most of our applications are still IE-only—expecting him to not know the difference between them. But surprisingly he had no problem switching them and getting back to the same log in screen.\n\nWe got the same results there though, so I became suspicious. I was almost certain the issue was user error of some sort at this point, since there were no incorrect password hits in AD. I figured now was the time I try and remote in. Unfortunately, for some reason, his computer name wasn't recorded anywhere, so I'd have to get it from him directly. My company never had the foresight to just slap a label on the workstation, so I'd have to rely on the user's ability to do basic things like locate the start menu and more advanced skills like locating and utilizing a search bar. \n\n&gt;**Me:** Okay, I need your computer name. Do you know how to find that?\n\n&gt;**Him:** No, I don't.\n\n&gt;**Me:** Okay. Go to the start menu.\n\nHe made that strangled sound again and I began to longingly envision myself becoming the cause of that. Oh I do so pine after the far-off days of technology capable of enabling manual strangulation through a phone receiver.\n\n&gt;**Him:** ...wh-what's that?\n\nHead of security. Entire facility.\n\n&gt;**Me:** (through a thin, false veneer of cheer) It's the button in the bottom left of your screen? With the windows symbol?\n\nHe made the noise again, mixing it up this time with a few confused oh, ah, and ums as I pictured him squinting, mouth agape, inches from the screen. Unfortunately I didn't know whether he was running Windows 7 or 10—and I doubted asking him would produce anything coherent— so I tried my best to vaguely help him locate it.\n\n&gt;**Me:** Okay. So do you see the time, in the bottom right?\n\n&gt;**Him:** ...yes...\n\n&gt;**Me:** Okay. It's part of a grey, maybe black, bar that goes along the bottom. It has all your icons on it? \n\n&gt;**Him:** ...yes...\n\n&gt;**Me:** And on the far, left side of that bar from the time should be the start menu. With a Windows logo? The icon looks like a flag or a curvy window? \n\nHis only response was respond in the negative and continue making confused, flustered noises. The internal scream that sounded throughout the depths of my mind was composed of frustration and anguish too potent for words to ever imprison in any form of prose. It was time for a new approach.\n\n&gt;**Me:** Nevermind, we'll find it a different way. On your keyboard. You see in the bottom row? The one with the flag symbol? The only one with a symbol instead of words.\n\n&gt;**Him:** I...I think...so...?\n\n&gt;**Me:** Press it. Did that open the start menu?\n\n&gt;**Him:** I...I don't know...? On my screen...it just...Control panel...? Network...? Computer...? I don't...so confusing...not computer savy...\n\nMore flustered noises. But hey, I figured out we're working with Windows 7, so that's something, right? It has to be. Windows 10 would never make Control Panel or your mapped drives that intuitive and easy to locate.\n\n&gt;**Me:** Yes. That thing that just opened. That's the start menu. Do you see the search bar at the bottom of it?\n\n&gt;**Him:** I don't...I don't know...I don't see it... This is impossible. Can you just escalate this to someone? I can't figure it out. It's too hard.\n\nHonestly, I wasn't supposed to do that. I was supposed to persevere, carry on. Run through all the troubleshooting. If I could just get the computer name I could almost remove him from the equation entirely. That's what I'd normally do. I gave objection under those pretenses, but it was halfhearted. This call—it had changed me.\n\nI'd come in to battle bright-eyed and unsoiled, flanked with a fully-equipped squad. Optimism. Patience. Sanity. Resolve. One by one each of them had been picked off to die and bleed out in my arms under a hail of willfully enforced ignorance. Until all that was left was just me and my lack of shits to give.\n\nWhen he protested again, equally half-heartedly, I flew the white flag of defeat.\n\n&gt;**Me:** (through a veneer of actual, *relieved* cheer) I can absolutely do that. Let me just send this off to the department that manages access to that app, I'm 100% sure it's on their end and has nothing to do with any error on your part at all. Don't sweat it. You have a great day.\n\nI wrapped up the ticket in a nice bow of the play-by-play notes of locating a goddamn start menu icon, and sent it lovingly off into the realm of *Not My Problem Anymore* hopefully to never be seen by me again.",

        "text": "Short one from this afternoon:\n\nI work in a somewhat unique situation in that I am on a team that manages the *product*, which being cloud-based, includes some network and system admins. In the same building, there is a Helpdesk team which manages the *office* which sells and supports the product. Making that separation even less clear, some of the more experienced Helpdesk employees have transitioned to the networks team over the years. In short, we have a problem with Helpdesk trying to enlist our help with issues outside our scope, or even dumping them in our laps disguised as \"asking for help\". We are a bit wary at this point any time a Helpdesk employee wanders into our area.\n\nThis afternoon, we finally got a replacement printer in our shared suite. This was generally considered a Good Thing as the old printer only would only manage to deliver a single page before going offline, and the next closest printer was three badge readers away.\n\nAs they happen to do, the Helpdesk employee (after installing and configuring the printer) took a lap to exchange social pleasantries with others in the office. They ended up wandering into my corner, and after some small talk, graced me with this conversation:\n\n&gt; **$HD**: Hey, who should be the contact for this printer?\n\n&gt; **$Me**: Contact? What do you mean? Probably whoever was the contact for the old printer, don't you think?\n\n*When in doubt, deflect responsibility before you catch it*\n\n&gt; **$HD**: This is a new system, there isn't an old contact. Would you be a good choice?\n\n*Agghh! Get it off! Get if Off!*\n\n&gt; **$Me**: **NO!** I mean, probably not, I'm out on location often. Why do you need a contact for each printer?\n\n&gt; **$HD**: Oh, it's just in case we need to talk to someone about the printer, you know.\n\n&gt; **$Me**: No, I don't. Talk to them about what?\n\n&gt; **$HD**: Like if there are issues, or if we need someone to take a look at it, you know.\n\n&gt; **$Me**: Issues? ... Helpdesk.\n\n&gt; **$HD**: What?\n\n&gt; **$Me**: If there are problems with the printer, you should contact the Helpdesk.\n\n&gt; **$HD**: ...but that's us...\n\n&gt; **$Me**: Yes.\n\n&gt; **$HD**: But who should we contact in this area?\n\n&gt; **$Me**: No one. You should contact yourself and take care of it.\n\n&gt; **$HD**: But what if we need to check out the printer in person? Who can we call to do that?\n\n&gt; **$Me**: Helpdesk. You're a sixty-second walk away from it, *you* can check it out in person.\n\n&gt; **$HD**: ...\n\n&gt; **$Me**: Look, this is a shared, common-use printer. It doesn't belong to any team, group, or individual. On top of that, it's literally your job description to deal with it. I'm sure, in individual cases, you can find someone down here who will be happy to give you a hand if you really need it, but no one in this area needs to have an additional task of managing this printer--especially if it is going to interrupt their normal course of work.\n\n&gt; **$HD**: So I should write down...\n\n&gt; **$Me**: Helpdesk.\n\n&gt; **$HD**: ...\n\n*The Helpdesk should contact the Helpdesk if they notice any issues with this printer that need to be resolved as the Helpdesk is responsible for all office computer equipment.*",

        "text": "**RC** = Receptionist\n\n**SA** = Me\n___\n\nThis may be a complaint post...maybe? I've spent all week doing support on it so I think it counts. If it doesn't please remove it.\n\n___\n\nApril of this year we finally migrated to a new cloud based VoIP provider for our phones. Migration went smoothly, adoption rate was amazing, everyone was happy. Everyone except **RC**- which is kind of a big deal as that's literally **RC**'s job, to answer the phone and manage incoming calls. There have been several complaints over the last few months, all revolving around the fact that **RC** doesn't know how to page out, transfer calls, or answer multiple lines. **RC** could do all this on the old system, but of course with new systems comes new processes, which requires - god forbid they hear me say it - learning new things! I spent the entire first week with this new system working with **RC** to make sure they were comfortable with it.\n\nIt all sort of came to a head during this week, with the explosion occurring this morning, like 3 hours ago.\n\n___\n\nTo keep it short(ish), in order for **RC** to send a page out to everyone's desk phones, there can't be an active line on **RC**'s phone. If **RC** wants to page out while someone is on hold, **RC** would need to park the call and then send the page. I went over the call parking process, it's a total of ***3***  button presses, but that's apparently way too many so another solution had to be found. There is a wireless handset **RC** can take if they leave the main desk, that wireless handset has the ability to page.\n\nCool, awesome, just use that to page while someone is on hold on the main phone, badda bing badda boom we're done here. Call paging has a total of...wait for it...***2*** button presses to complete the page. Below is the conversation from this morning.\n\n___\n\n&gt; **SA** :: Hey **RC**, I know you've had some issues with \npaging so I found a quick and easy way to do it. If you have someone on hold on the main line and want to do a page, just pick up the mobile phone, press this button, then this one, speak, then hang up. Quick and easy right?\n\n&gt;**RC** :: But on the old system I could do it all from the main phone\n\n&gt;**SA** :: I know, but with this new system we have to do it a little different. In fact it's even less buttons to press with the new one, isn't that awesome?\n\n&gt;**RC** :: No, that's completely unacceptable. I want to do it the way I did on the old system.\n\n&gt;**SA** :: I understand and I hear you, but unfortunately with this new system, there's a new way to do things. The old way won't work on the new system\n\n&gt;**RC** :: That's not right. I know for a fact I've done it the old way on this new system, it just stopped working this week\n\n&gt;**SA** :: Ok....I can see why that would be frustrating. Let me find out if there have been any updates or feature changes that would have caused this.\n\n___\n\nQuick chat with support revealed no, no feature changes, no updates. It's literally impossible to page out the way **RC** wants to do it. No way has **RC** done it that way on the new system. Back to the story.\n\n___\n\n&gt;**SA** :: So I called support just to see if there was a way we can make this work for you, they said it's impossible to page out the way you want to, that it's not an option and never has been. Maybe you're mis-remembering? We did just get this system recently, maybe you're thinking of the old one?\n\n&gt;**RC** :: No, I know I've done the paging that way before on this system.\n\n&gt;**SA** :: Ok....but it can't be done that way, so that's not possible. You couldn't have done it that way\n\n&gt;**RC** :: Ok so now you're telling me what I have or haven't done in the past. Thanks, I really appreciate it. This is ridiculous and completely unacceptable. I want to do it the way I always have before. If I can't do it that way then we need to get a new phone system, this one doesn't work.\n\n___\n\nOk, ya sure, let me breach contract, cancel our service, and replace hundreds of phones- all because one feature for one person has to be completed a different way from the old way. I'll get right on that.\n\n___\n\n&gt;**SA** :: We aren't going to get a new phone system, that's not an option. I know you're upset but this is the way you'll have to do it if you want to page out while you have a call on hold.\n\n&gt;**RC** :: This is unacceptable ***(there's that word again...)***. I'm putting in a complaint with leadership, this phone system is terrible and we need a new one.\n\n&gt;**SA** :: If you feel the need to do that, go ahead. But that's not going to change the way the system operates, it's not going to change the process you have to follow to page out. Here are the instructions, I printed them out for you. Let me know if it doesn't work. If you try to do it the old way, it won't work, and I don't want to hear about it. Have a good day.\n\n___\n\nCue the end of one of the worst interactions I've had with a user. Dear god. It's like the idea that there is new technology and a new process to learn is so deeply offensive it won't even be considered. That's fine, good luck keeping your job as a receptionist when you don't know how to use the phone system.\n",

Yesterday, after silencing the bagpipe sound that is my alarm and still slightly bleary eyed, I see an email from my boss. He's asking me to go check up on a user that is reporting missing files that are (actually) mission critical. Being still half asleep I start thinking worst case scenario. These particular clients don't take advantage of the backup service we offer and rely on saving things in the cloud. If these files are missing, then the client is going to be SOL and there wouldn't be anything I can do to fix it.\n\nI make a point of always clarifying with users exactly what their issue is. An email might say: *\"Help, none of my office apps are working\"*, but they mean *\"Help, Outlook isn't syncing between my devices\"*. This was no exception.\n\nI call up the user and he tells me that $FileSyncSoftware on his desktop PC is showing the files, but they are missing on his laptop.\n\n\"*This is good news*\" I think to myself. The files exist in at least one place at the moment. The client says that he has to leave the office, but he'll leave the desktop and laptop on for me and have the file explorer windows open to show me what's missing. After getting the specifics on what files and folders seems to be missing, I tell him that I'm on my way and head out the door. \n\nThe Traffic Gods must have known what was coming for me when I got there because I sailed down a section of the highway that is typically bumper to bumper traffic most mornings. When the Traffic Gods take pity on you, you know it's going to be interesting.\nOnce onsite I walk over to the two machines, sit down, look at the screens for all of 3 seconds, and just hang my head.\n\nOn the desktop, the file path is *$SharedCloudFolder &gt; $Company &gt; $Folder_A*. On the laptop, the path is  *$SharedCloudFolder &gt; $Company &gt; $Folder_A &gt; Folder_Asub1*. \n\nI click the up-one-level button on the file browser and declare victory.\n\nI have to remember that I know how to use a PC really well, but I know next to nothing about how to do what my client does for a living. \n\nI heard it put like this once: *You don't hire a plumber to wire the house and you don't hire an electrician to install a toilet*.\n\nAlso, The Traffic Gods smiled upon me on the way home too. Nothing like flying at 90 on the way to your favorite donuts and coffee store. ",

        "text": "In this episode, we have the mysterious case of the possessed PC.\n\n​\n\nOnce upon a time, I worked offshore for a surveying company. I got a rather frantic call regarding a PC that was \"possessed\". Intrigued, I headed downstairs to assess the situation. What I found when I got there was the cursor moving erratically around the screen. I figured some driver or other had gone haywire, and decided to reboot the offending PC. This turned out to be a bigger challenge that I expected. I ended up having to resort to keyboard shortcuts to shut the machine down. I forget whether this was a Windows 2000 machine or one running Windows XP. I got the machine restarted, and as soon as it booted up, the cursor began jumping all over the place again. It was moving icons hither and yon, opening and closing menus, and generally playing merry hell with the system. I thought perhaps the mouse had lost its tiny little mind, but disconnecting it did not resolve the issue. I decided to revert back to troubleshooting basics and unplugged EVERYTHING from the machine except power and the monitor. The cursor became quiescent. Eureka! I began to plug various cables in one by one until I discovered the source of the problem. Apparently, Windows sees GPS data as a mouse. I don't remember the fix to the problem, but we were eventually able to actually have GPS data input into the PC without having a cursor zooming across the screen.\n\n​\n\nNow, it should be fairly obvious that this issue was many years ago, and I had largely forgotten the incident... until a few weeks ago, when an officer reported that he was unable to control his computer because it was \"possessed\". The laptop functioned perfectly on my test bench, so we brought the offending laptop down to his cruiser to see if the demon was residing in his vehicle. As soon as he plugged everything into his laptop, the cursor immediately went to the top left corner of the screen and refused to budge. While it was in that corner, it would repeatedly open menus, dialogs, highlight things, etc. I unplugged the officer's GPS and all was well. This was a windows 10 PC and a USB GPS... In this case, making sure the GPS was not connected when the PC booted seemed to resolve the issue.\n\n​\n\nI am still working with the software vendor to be able to take in GPS data across the network so that we can eliminate the USB GPS.\n\n​\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

They run a couple programs that allow them to manage client history, check and run Xrays, etc. They use simple USB sensors and tend to swap them out often because they may use multiple sensors to take multiple readings, easy peasy, right?\n\nThe problem is, the USB ports were being destroyed by them swapping the sensors in and out so aggressively and so constantly that I decided to plug a usb Extender into the back of the PC and secure the female end to the Desk near the monitor.

They went outside of IT and purchased this so we had minimal involvement because they knew what they were doing and besides this has sensitive data...\n\nSo time passes and we start getting complaints about our iSeries being too slow. Our particular system is a beast and pretty much outruns anything we've put up against it. So since it involves SQL I get asked to help.\n\nSo I go back and forth with the Finance 'tech' person and finally convince him to send me his SQL script.\n\nThe basic deal is they want to run this every two hours so they can have near real time data. Unfortunately at this time his script is taking... you guessed it, two hours...\n\nThe back-end for their BI product is SQL Server. So his script is basically pulling data from the iSeries (DB2) through a database connection directly into SQL Server tables.\n\nI examine his script to see what it is doing. Basically he is hitting one of the largest tables in the database thirteen times, once for each financial period, and pulling raw data down and then the part that is losing time he is then consolidating all of this data from tens of millions of rows down to thousands of rows using grouping by and sums.\n\nCompared to the iSeries (think Formula 1 Ferrari) his SQL Server is a go-cart with a Briggs and Stratten 5 hp engine.\n\nI call and ask him if he needs any of this detail data and he only needs the summary. Bingo.\n\nI rewrite all of his script to use a pass through query, which is basically SQL Server asking the other system to do all the work, and do all of the summation on the iSeries side and give him the results. As I said the iSeries is a beast and does the summations without even breathing hard. SQL Server is happy as it is now getting the data much quicker.\n\nNow the script runs in five minutes. At this point I look at the functional part and realize we could accomplish all of this even faster if we did one download into a table and created thirteen views. I showed this to our financial BI person and she just sighs. He designed the database around his spreadsheet. He has thirteen tabs on his spreadsheet, one for each period, hence the thirteen tables and thirteen calls to the database.\n\nI call him and discuss this and now he gets very angry! He knows how to design a database thank you very much. So where am I on his query? It runs in five minutes (but with views we could get it down to under a minute). So I have to prove to him we are getting the same result and he finally concedes this is better. But he won't listen on creating views.\n\nWe end up closing the ticket at this point.\n\nSo the only real SQL magic is use the right tool at the right point to do the heavy lifting. iSeries rocks!",

We are just wrapping up a migration of our Exchange environment to Office 365 so we've seen a few issues similar to this one already.

Let's just leave the IT work to the IT professionals, Okay? Okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Angry user wants issue fixed. The solution is to recreate the outlook profile.

Now the thing is tickets can be created by someone, but the *reported by* field can be a different person.\n\nAbout 2-3 weeks ago we got a ticket sent to our queue from a manager that wanted one of their staff members' internet access restricted. I remember one particular bit that said 'please restrict access to sites like news sites, world news, vintage cars' and she noted down the name of the user to have her access restricted. Whoever looked at the ticket before flicking it to us (even though web access is an entirely different department located overseas) put in the manager's details as the ticket creator, and the 'reported by' field with the *user's* details. This meant that an email would be sent out to not just the manager, but that particular person that she wanted off those sites.\n\nMy supervisor and I just laughed at the imagery of the situation that would follow, before flicking the ticket to the correct department.",

All the computers along that wall connect to that switch which then runs up in to the ceiling and down to the new server room.

Once I worked out that I would give a series of instructions and think about what the solution would be in an N -1 kinda way, the troubleshooting went OK.\n\nAs for the solution, I could not get $PwP to actually do that. ANYTHING that made him do N vs. N -1 would send him into a fit of horrific self-criticism.\n\nI learned more about the faults of his personality asking him to just do one final single step than I know about my own wife. For TWO HOURS I knew what the problem was, but could not get him to implement the simple fix. Even when I tried to tell him to do another step first, he'd balk, since I'd already let it slip the final step would end the call.\n\nFinally, I realized he was simply incapable of executing the actual step N, I tried to get him to put $Dad back on the phone, presenting him with another N vs N -1 problem. There was no second step. 30 minutes later, he finally agreed to do this.\n\nNot by his own volition, however. FIRST, I asked him to add paper to the printer, then go get $Dad. When he came back on the phone to tell me he'd added paper, $Dad picked up!\n\nI told $Dad what was going on and asked him to make the change- aka reboot the printer- and it would be fixed. And it did.\n\nTurns out, that this was a monitored call, and my boss was listening in during that whole call. He came up to me afterward and said it was the best handling of perhaps the most troublesome customer he'd ever heard.\n\nKudos to me.",

In one of the systems the most recent file update was in 2012, So not a chance it was on our end and I was 99% sure — but the two sites they visit on my server were the only ones that seemed to have these issues.   That part I’m pretty sure is because of the type of data transfer happening with our sites, and the fact that they are  on those sites all day every day and probably wouldn’t even notice it if it happened somewhere else. \n\nI went up to their office tonight and spent 3 hours helping them go through their computers to find the issue. \n\nIn the end, the router in their office was hacked and redirecting certain traffic to a JavaScript based crypto mining malware. \n\nIt was insane. We had every computer in the office turned off, and only one connected to the internet - still having the same issue. \n\nI noticed something weird about the way the page on the tab was showing (it had only the address, and the address was in quotes) - so I did a view source and it showed a JavaScript wrapper with CoinHive in there, then a frame that loaded the original site address — this is why no post data was coming through on the one system, and why the customer info was blanked out on the second system (because it wasn’t actually handing the request properly, just taking the address and spitting it back in the iframe)\n\nThey had another computer in the corner that hadn’t been connected to the network in a few years.  \n\nWe made sure nothing else was on the network, and plugged that one in (to make sure it wasn’t a virus that had spread to all computers) - same problem. \n\nThat narrowed it down to the modem, and 2 routers (one was just used as a wireless access point)\n\nA quick google search for the MikroTik router and CoinHive showed that a significant number of those routers have been compromised and created a coin mining bot net. \n\nRan to the store and grabbed a new router and had them back online with everything working!\n\nSuper insanely crazy.",

Hope you enjoy it. \n\n---\n\nThere are a bunch of people involved in this story, but most of them are a faceless mass of innocent users who know so little about computers that they don't recognize the stupidity of the manager that was setting them up in the system. Let's collectively call them $InnocentUsers and their manager $Fool. \n\nThere's also my $HelpfulBoss and mentor, and then, of course, me. \n\n&gt; $Fool: A lot of my $IUs are experiencing major slowdowns with $WebApplication. It's hurting our work!\n\n$HB immediately leaps into action to start diagnosing the issue. A slowdown on our application means something is really wrong. See, we have five servers, four application servers and a load balancer, designed to distribute the work to avoid these slowdowns. If it's slowing down, then one or more servers is having issues. \n\nBut a brainwave strikes $HB.\n\n&gt; $HB: Hey, $Fool, what URL are you and the $IUs using?\n\n&gt; $Fool: `&lt;ServerNumber&gt;.&lt;bank&gt;.com:&lt;portNumber&gt;\\&lt;applicationNonsense&gt;`\n\nCue facepalm between me and $HB. They were using one of the development URLs that accessed one specific server, rather than the load balancer's url (wich was a short, pretty, and sensible url like acronym.bank.com). That meant that one poor application server was getting 4x the traffic and couldn't enlist the help of the other three. \n\nWhile he goes on to try to fix stupidity — and isn't that an impossible task — $HB then orders me to start looking through the log files to see if anything else is wrong. I doubt there is, but it can't hurt to check, right?\n\nWrong. \n\nI'm writing this from my phone, and my boss came up to me a minute ago before I could post. I set this aside and we had this exchange. \n\n&gt; $HB: why are you looking at raw log files? We've got this cool app that can help visualize them!\n\nThis is news to me. \n\n&gt; Me, internally: Fuck yes! Hallelujah!\n\n&gt; Me, out loud: Great. \n\n&gt; My asshole computer: Hahahah! Nope. \n\nEarlier this morning, we were using my laptop to experiment with Java version compatibility. Our company laptops, being as locked down as they are, use a remote software portal to install new and approved software. I'd selected the new version of Java to install and let it do its thing behind the scenes. \n\nIt failed. Spectacularly. Without notifying me. \n\nSo when I go to install the log viewer application, it turns out it haf uninstalled Java entirely and failed to reinstall it. I'm currently waiting for it to try again, because after seening the sheer size of the log files (remember, 4x the expected user traffic and all the problems that causes), I do not want to deal with that garbage by hand. \n\nAnyway, wish me luck. I don't know if the software portal will fail again, but I hope not. ",

        "text": "I'm sure I'm skating the line here with this story considering the amount of \"tech support\" that was actually provided, but I've been dying to tell it. If I'm in the wrong sub please tell me (and suggest the right one if you can). Thanks!\n\n​\n\nSo anyway, I work at a college  help-desk. My job mainly consists of helping students and staff navigate the extensive and somewhat convoluted College system, more or less monitor the systems and alert admins when something is going wrong for students or in general (online school program is down, wifi out,etc) as well as maintain the library computers and make sure the 60k piece of crap printers don't jam more than twice a day.\n\nA big one is emails. My college uses Gsuite, which is basically just fancy Gmail that the college makes students get when they register, and is the only email they'll send college related stuff to.\n\nI get a call one day from a woman who sounds kinda panicked.\n\nMe: Hello, how can I help you?\n\nLady: Hi, are the college emails private?\n\nMe: what do you mean?\n\nLady: I mean I thought only the school could contact us through them, right? Just the school?\n\nI know the email is basically just a gmail with some extra protections on it from the college, but otherwise works just like a normal email and tell her this.\n\nLady: are you sure? Because I haven't put it on any sites or anything and I just got an email from a woman claiming to be the daughter I gave up for adoption 40 years ago?!\n\nYo, *what*? This floored me. I couldn't actually advise her on what action to take, all I could tell her is if she hadn't posted it anywhere there was a very real possibility that it was her daughter. Emails also aren't listed anywhere outside of online classes where other students can see them, so it genuinely was a, \"holy shit\" moment. I ended up giving her my name and she said she'd, \"come in and update me on what happens\" because she was going to pursue it. I was honestly hoping she would actually come in, though I didn't expect it.\n\nLo and behold two days later she came to the desk and asked for me.\n\nIt was her daughter.\n\nThrough some question and answer stuff she figured out this lady was legitimately her daughter, and had managed to track her (the mother) down through a lot of extensive file digging and found her college email through this (apparently you can request emails). She was so excited and stunned because she'd hoped forever her kid would reach out but she never did, and she didn't even know where to start looking for her (she thought she'd moved as a kid, turned out she was in the same county of the same state the woman gave her up for adoption in).\n\nNow she has a daughter, and a 19 year old granddaughter, and both of them are coming up to visit the mother in September.\n\nShe told me if I hadn't been able to help her eliminate the possibilities of it being a hack she might never have responded. It's very tech-support lite in a sense, and I don't really think I should be given that much credit, but I'll be damned if that wasn't the best experience I've ever had at my job.\n\nEdit: She actually just came up while I was at work and told me her daughter bought a ticket and is coming down way earlier than she thought she was. She's super excited!\n\nEdit 2: Can't believe the reaction to this post, I wanted to say I am so, so glad this has brightened some peoples days!  I loved reading some of the stories on here, and thank you various individuals for the compliments; I'm just glad I lucky enough to do my job that day!\n\nEdit 3: Holy shit thanks for the gold stranger!",

        "text": "Been wracking my brain for stuff to post here that won’t just be disappointing or have no definitive ending.\n\n\nThis story focuses more on the personal side of tech support instead of faulty tech but I felt this would be a good one to share.\nThis happened back in 2013/14-ish when I was desperately trying to cover a server monitoring and maintenance gig with only the faintest smattering of 0.5 tier server knowledge.\n\nOne of our client’s servers had conked out so completely and utterly that the vendor was flying in a technician from another country to help us either fix it or make sure we got the right replacement for it. \nNaturally I got picked to meet up with the tech and show him around. I guess my coworkers thought I needed to get away from the screen a while.  \nAnyway, I’m waiting at the airport, scanning over the arrivals when my eyes fall on this guy in a suit jacket, metal band t-shirt and jeans with a maybe three or four day beard and ponytail. That can’t be the tech, right? Nah he can’t be. Next person, next, keep looking for our tech, next. Wait, did that band t-shirt guy just grab a travel case with a vendor logo on it? Damn he did and he’s coming this way. \nI intercept the guy and we do the meet and greet thing. I offered to give him a ride to his hotel and pick him up in a few hours but he wanted to head straight to the site and see what he was up against. During the ride to the site we chatted about all kinds of stuff like music (pretty much identical taste), books (sci-fi and fantasy both of us) and retro gaming (PSX vs N64, everlasting love for the SNES was mutual).\n\n\nWe eventually get to the site and get down to the nitty gritty. After a few hours of troubleshooting i can tell the tech is top-notch and we could definitely say the server was fsck’d beyond repair. RAID-0, obsolete equipment and beyond end-of-life software doesn’t play well together at the best of times, much less when one of the components does the digital equivalent of shooting a cylinder through the bonnet at highway speed.   \nIt’s now late afternoon and we decide to call it a day to regroup tomorrow. I drive him over to his hotel (with a in-depth discussion on the subject of SNES games during the ride there) and we agree to carpool to the site the next day. \n\n\nThe next day I show up early to our predetermined meeting spot, since it’s opposite one of the best coffee places in town. After getting a cappuccino to go with a double espresso on the side I get back in my car and wait for the tech. Our agreed upon time comes and no tech in sight. 5 minutes pass, no tech. 10 minutes in and I’m starting to get worried. About 15 minutes after our agreed upon time the tech turns up looking like he hasn’t slept at all. He gets in the car without saying more than a quick “good morning”. None of the talkative banter we had yesterday was there and any question I asked to try to start a conversation was answered with either a noncommittal “uh-huh” or a shrug. \n\n\nOnce back on site he focused solely on work, not chitchat, no banter, no nothing. Just coldly and efficiently sorting out what needed replacing, like a machine going through programmed motions. Something was seriously wrong. I have seen that behaviour a few times before and it’s never because something good has happened. Lunch swings around and I decide enough is enough. I took him out to a local joint that does awesome Thai food and after a lunch consisting of green curry chicken spicy enough to nearly blister the paint on the walls (it will cure what ails you or kill you, I swear) I decided to take the bull by the horns and ask him what was wrong. \n\n\nAfter a bit of verbal poking back and forth I finally crack his shell and got a lot more than I bargained for.   \nApparently he and his girlfriend had had an argument that night which had escalated into a shouting match, during which his girlfriend of three years had dumped him and told him outright that she had cheated on him for over two months. Add to that the fact she was his first girlfriend and his childhood crush and it’s clear why he was in such a state. We both knew that there wasn’t going to be much work done that afternoon and clocked out early. I had planned to drop him off at his hotel and go home but I ended up spending that whole day with him at his hotel room, just talking and being there for him. Now when I look back on it it was pretty weird, us having only met the day before but it felt like we had known each other for a lifetime. Any plans I had to go home for the night went right out the window when we ended up cuddling in his hotel bed. \n\n\nThe next day we were both ready to tackle sorting out what needed replacing on site and after two weeks we had the new server up and running and taking traffic off of the temporary server my coworkers had set up. All’s well that end well, right?\n\n\nWe had some very memorable moments those two weeks but nothing serious came of it. We both agreed that long distance wouldn’t work out and neither of us was ready to just up and move to a new country on a whim. We kept in touch for a few years afterwards but last time we spoke he was about to get married. C’est la vie I guess. \n\n\nTL;DR: Tech “support”, wink wink, nudge nudge.\n\n\n**Edit**: Spelling, my worst enemy.",

Turns out their IT had performed an upgrade and broke it, and their IT provider was on holiday that day. To be helpful (big mistake), I dialled in, showed her where the new file that I emailed across should go. Literally a copy/paste job. I then wrote out a 3 step how-to on how to do this and emailed it with the new file they'd need. Looked a bit like this.\n\n1. Download attachment on this email\n2. Put that file in C:\\program files\\file\n3. If it asks you to overwrite, click yes\n\nThe reason I did this because the client was running the software locally on their machines, meaning they'd need to perform this task on every machine in the office. I mean we're just the software providers, we shouldn't be messing with another company's machines. All they'd have to do is circulate this email and get everyone to do it. Easy right?\n\nYou can imagine how this went. Cue about 3 hours of heated arguments, calls from everyone on their team from the part time receptionist to their senior management and later directorial staff. Their director was the one who I quoted in the topic title. I'm quite sure nobody even read the instructions I sent across, they were just really angry that I wasn't doing \"it\". \n\nSo yes I spent about 3 hours today remoting into our clients systems one by one to copy paste a file on each person's machines.

        "text": "When I worked for a smallish municipal government, I supported not only PC's, but also mobile devices like Iphones. I have never been comfortable with Iphones... I don't personally own one. I was briefly issued one by this local government, but I never did much with it besides answer phone calls. We didn't really have any training or instructions for the Iphone and at the time of this call, I didn't have an Iphone to work with on my side. This will probably all seem sorta sad and pathetic to anyone who is really familiar with Iphones, but here we go. \n\n\nIt's about 4:30pm. I normally clock out at 5pm, but 4:30 is when we more or less stop taking calls because we need to start doing our end of day tasks. Generally, unless it's an emergency, we don't do much more then enter a ticket after 4:30. Predictably, my phone rings right at 4:30. The user needs email set up on his phone. This should be a quick call, I'll just get it knocked out and finish up my paperwork. \n\n\nThe user has no idea what kind of phone he has, but I'm eventually able to determine that he has an Iphone. Joy... So, I start walking him through the process for setting up email... from memory... \n\nI fumble around a bit, but eventually I get him to the home screen ( don't ask ). Here's more or less what follows:\n\n\n$me: Okay, now please look for an icon called Settings.\n\n\n$user: I don't see that.\n\n\n$me: it might be on the next screen, so you might have to swipe to the left.\n\n\n$user: I still don't see it. \n\n\n$me: it has to be there somewhere, just keep swiping left until you find it. \n\n\n$user: I think I found it. \n\n\n$me: Great! Click on that, then look for mail or mail settings or maybe add account? Do you see any of those? You may have to scroll down a bit. \n\n\n$user: I see mail...\n\n\n$me: Okay, click on that please. Now we just need to add an account. \n\n\n$user: Okay, I'm looking. \n\n\n$user: Okay, I think I found it. \n\n\n$me: Great! Enter your email address...\n\n\n$user: Okay, it's asking me for my name, email address, and password. \n\n\n$me: Perfect! Fill all of those in... \n\n\n$user: Okay.\n\n\n$me: Now, you'll have to change the email server from xxxx.xxx to mail.xxxx.xxx. \n\n\n$user: Where do I do that? \n\n\n$me: You should see an advanced button, click on that. \n\n\n$user: I don't see that, but it looks like it's all set up now.\n\n\n$me: Great, you should start seeing your emails now. It will take a few minutes to pull all of them down. \n\n\n$user: I don't have to do anything on my phone? \n\n\n$me: ...\n\n\n$me: *...*!!!\n\n\n$me: What? \n\n\n$user: I don't have to configure anything on my phone to see my emails? \n\n\n$me: What have you been doing all this time? \n\n\n$user: Configuring outlook on my computer. \n\n\n$me: ***HEADDESK*** Are... Are you kidding? \n\n\n$user: No, I thought we had to set up outlook to send mail to my phone. \n\n\n$me: *looks at the clock* Can we finish this up tomorrow?\n\n\n$me: (hears my coworker in the next cubicle HOWLING in laughter)\n\n\n\n",

Well I certainly got experience today.\n\nI get there, and I get given the job of labelling all the cords flowing from the server rack to the switches, so that it'll be easier to troubleshoot in the future. Sure thing boss Man, I got this. I'm actually pretty happy, I've mainly been helping Co-Guy with reimaging laptops and computers, along with general assistance, and it's good to try and learn new things. \n\nSo I'm labelling away, sure it's not exciting, but I really want to a good job. \n\nBoss Man comes in: \"&amp;gt;Did you unplug something? Because I've just lost internet and the printers have gone down.\" \n\n\"&amp;gt;Nope.\"\n\nI quickly look at the switch I was in front of, it all looks good, Co-Guy checks the Boss Mans cord, it's plugged in, all good.\n\nSo we start troubleshooting. I'm barely adjusted to packet tracer and setting up a CISCO router and switch, basic programming and web design, I'm not much help here.\n\nBoss Mans phone is ringing, people wanting to the printers can't print, the world's on fire, then the phone stops. The phone system is now down.\n\nBoss Man logs in to the server, the server starts to freeze, another server is half frozen, oh dear god. Hard reboot, no one can access emails. Great.\n\nRestart the router, phones are back, kinda, you still can't use them to call, and apparently that's an important function. \n\nIt's been two hours. We're still troubleshooting, at this point we think a switch has died, we're following the cords, going from switch to switch. \n\nBoss Man: \"&amp;gt; **Apricot_Bar**, can you tell me what port this cord is plugged into?\" \n\n\"&amp;gt;Sure it plugged into por- it's not plugged in properly. It's only half in.\" \n\nBoss Man: \"&amp;gt;Let's plug that back in yeah?\" \n\nSo yeah, I messed up today. It kinda threw me off for the day. I wouldn't blame them if they didn't want me volunteering there any more. But hey, at least I got some experience. Boss Man and Co-Guy were alright about, but I still felt awful. \n",

For example, one of the sites had upwards of 200 plugins on it, so I work on that one first.\n\nI'm checking each plugin and seeing if its function is still necessary, when I come across one that had been written by my predecessor at the company, called \"CompanyName tag-based sidebar\"  I ask my supervisor, $supe, who was also my predecessor's supervisor, what it does.\n\n&gt;$me: Hey, do you know what this plugin does?\n\n&gt;$supe: Oh, that was written for the old version of the site.  It's supposed to show related content in the sidebar. We don't need that anymore.\n\n&gt;$me: Okay, thanks.\n\nI dutifully remove the plugin.  A week or so later, the guy who manages the web store comes to me.\n\n&gt;$storeGuy: Hi, there used to be a custom post type called advertisements, and it's gone now.  Do you know what happened to it?\n\n&gt;$me: Nope, but I'll look into it.\n\nSo I check the site's code, and I see almost-identical code for a post type called \"promotions\".  I then assume that the code to create the advertisement post type had been in the same file, and that some clueless person had deleted it, because it looked like it was a duplicate.  I restore the advertisement post type.\n\nAnother week passes, and $storeGuy comes back to me.\n\n&gt;$storeGuy: So the advertisements are appearing on Page X of the site like they're supposed to, but I just noticed that they're missing from the sidebars of page type Y.  Can you fix that too?\n\n&gt;$me: I'll poke around.\n\nI open the site in GiantNetArchive, and find a page with the relevant sidebar.  The ads are there, so I inspect them...and they all contain a data redirect through a plugin called \"tag-sidebar\"  Oops.\n\nI look at the code for the plugin (thankfully I saved the code before removing it) and discover that that plugin created the advertisement post type, as well as a sidebar widget to display said ads and track clicks and impressions.  So much for $supe's assurances that we didn't need it anymore.\n\nI restore the plugin and re-add the widget to the sidebar, everything is fine and dandy, and $storeGuy thinks I'm a genius.\n\nI realize that part of this is on me, and that I could have checked the plugin's code before removing it, but I had 200-odd plugins to get through, and I really didn't have the time or inclination to check all of them that closely",

        "text": "I work for a IT support company, in the role of installing the infrastructure and sometimes devices...and leave the configuration to my co workers. \n\nA couple of weeks ago I am issued a ticket to stop over to a client to check and test a couple data jacks that are not working. I pulled up the clients address and navigate on over to the location as this was the first time for me to visit this client. I enter the large commercial building and check the directory for suite number and proceed to the floor. I am greeted to a locked and darken office with a hand written sign on the door that stated said client has recently moved to a new location. Strange, I call my PM and ask if he has sent me to the wrong location and he says, no. I confirm the address and I am on the right spot. I then call the client and he acts shocked to know that our company, the one he pays for IT support, does not know they have moved offices recently. He rattles off the new address and within 15 mins I am now at the new office across town.\n\nI enter to find the new location is an existing office location but it’s network infrastructure is a disaster. The client barks orders as to the 5 locations that are not working, and then disappears on lunch. My PM phones to check on things and I relay the state of mess before me. I am then grilled for 10 mins by my PM to which I ask, “did we know they moved offices?” They moved offices!!!!? No one told us according to the PM.\n\nTurns out he failed to properly shut down and transport and reinstall/reconnect his domain server, his on site VOIP server and a few other servers, the replaced damaged drives are slowly getting the backups reimaged. He changed his ISP and couldn’t get his SIP service in the new location so he had POTS line connected to serve his VOIP phones, previously served by SIP service, and I am sure I am missing a few other screw ups, like forgetting his APs on the ceiling of the old office, Landlord has locked him out for non payment of rent.\n\nWhen I checked ticket history turns out days before he had called and logged a complaint about a couple computers and phones not working. When my company support tech couldn’t remotely connect, client claimed it was a couple bad cables...ticket was escalated to send me out to check for damaged infrastructure. Turns out client moved across town changed service type and providers and damaged his own servers, because to quote him “ he didn’t need and over paid nerd to connect a few computers and phones”. He is now paying more for us to fix his issues and has had more down time then if he had requested our help in the first place! ",

        "text": "Last month we get a priority 1 critical must be done immediately ticket. \n\n&gt;Effective in 3 days vendor A will no longer process orders. All orders must go to internal team B. All existing integration points should remain intact. ***some technical details here***\n\nSo...this had to have been a long running project...it took a year to set up the initial integration with vendor A. They want us to take it down and set it all up again in 3 days...sigh...manager decided to jump for them since this was very business critical. \n\nWe work 3 days straight with maybe 4 hours of sleep a night each person and get everything done. \n\nThis month...we get a priority 1 critical must be done immediately ticket. \n\n&gt;The transition from vendor A to internal team B didn't go as planned. There will be a rollback and vendor A will resume orders effective immediately. Please revert to original state. Manually sending all the orders is a lot of work for internal team B. The new estimated transition time is Jan 2019.\n\nYou've got to be fucking kidding me here...we just spent a ton of work changing this for you...no way we're reverting it just to have to redo the work again later...please boss man don't tell us to jump again...please?\n\n&gt;Manager's reply: We will be doing this work.\n\nNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\n\n&gt;Manager reply: However we have an extensive backlog. \n\nWait a minute what?\n\n&gt;Manager's reply: We take work in the order we receive it unless there is a critical business need. We completed your original ask within 3 days when you should have told us when the transition project began. This new ask is at the back of the line. \n\nYESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS\n\n&gt;Manager's reply: Based on our current backlog we'll get to this around Feb 2019. We'll contact you when we're ready to begin to see if you still need the changes. \n\n\nIn other news with the 3 straight days of work the team got 3 comp days yay.",

        "text": "My Tuesday started with a great facepalm moment before I'd even gotten to work.\n\n**$pp** &gt; me, potplanty\n\n**$fish** &gt; oblivious user lacking common sense, best caught with a spear\n\n**$randombank** &gt; some random bank in my country\n\nI received an email this morning that had me do a double take. It was from one of my company's...less competent users (mind you these users are all mid 20s and should have a firm grasp on technology).\n\n\"Hi $pp, is this spam? I'm not with $randombank\"\n\nCurious, I read the email and come to several very quick conclusions. I'm sure you'll be able to get the gist of what they were. The email read something to the effect of;\n\n&gt;\\*Started with a missing header image (server unavailable)*\n\n&gt;Hello $fish@ocean.com\n\n&gt;You've submitted a payment to a new person\n\n&gt;\\*fake account details with not enough digits*\n\n&gt;Amount: $800\n\n&gt;Login now to confirm the payment\n\n&gt;Please click *here* to cancel payment\n\n&gt;Thanks for banking with $randombank\n\nNow immediately a few things stand out;\n\n1. They don't have an account with that bank\n\n2. They didn't transfer $800 to anyone\n\n3. None of the bank logos were there, just a missing header image. No signatures, no Facebook/Twitter icons or anything.\n\n4. They never mentioned $fish's real name once, only ever by email address.\n\nSo with my most professional tone I sent back something to the effect of \"Well $fish, if you don't remember transferring $800 to anyone and you don't have an account with $randombank then we can probably assume it's fake.\"\n\nEven our most seasoned worker (mid/late sixties) just sat there in disbelief when I recounted the story to her.\n\nI'd like to say the rest of the day was better but that would be a lie. Hence why I'm wasting time on here, telling you guys all about the users I deal with.",
