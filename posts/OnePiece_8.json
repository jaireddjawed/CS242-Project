        "text": "The Straw Hat Pirates arrive at a new island, only to discover that the place is in the midst of a wild west setting. The town is run by a corrupt sheriff, and outlaws roam the countryside, terrorizing the townspeople. The crew decides to take matters into their own hands and help the town.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChapter 1: The Arrival\n\nAs the Straw Hat Pirates arrive at the island of Deadwood, they meet a mysterious woman named Jill who takes an interest in them. They quickly learn that the town is being overrun by bandits, and that Jill is actually the sister of the local resistance leader, Jack. Luffy can't help but be excited by the prospect of taking on the bandits, while Nami is skeptical of the situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChapter 2: Meeting the Locals\n\nThe Straw Hats team up with Jill's group, and together they make a plan to take down the corrupt sheriff and his band of outlaws. Along the way, Sanji can't help but be smitten with Jill, but she only has eyes for the cause. They soon meet a young boy named Timmy, who is sick and in need of medical attention. Chopper volunteers to help and discovers that there is a larger outbreak in the town. He works tirelessly to cure the townspeople, gaining their trust.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChapter 3: Showdown with the Outlaws\n\nAs they battle the outlaws, Zoro faces off against a formidable henchman named Kurogane, who is a skilled swordsman. Meanwhile, Usopp cowers behind the group, too scared to fight. Nami comes out dressed as a cute bandit girl. Brook and Jimbe each have their moment to shine with a one-liner: \"I may be a skeleton, but I still have some flesh to cut!\" and \"You picked the wrong sea to mess with!\" Luffy's named move, the \"Wild West Roundhouse,\" knocks back several of the outlaws with a single punch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChopper, with his medical knowledge, saves a group of children who were taken hostage by the bandits. He earns the admiration of the townspeople, who see him as a hero.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChapter 4: The Corrupt Sheriff\n\nAs they learn more about the corrupt sheriff and his ties to a mysterious businessman, the Straw Hats realize that they must stop him in order to save the town. Franky uses his cyborg modifications to shoot a laser at the corrupt businessman's hideout while yelling super, every man is amazed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChapter 5: The Final Showdown\n\nThe Straw Hats confront Jack and his crew, ready to take down the notorious pirate. Zoro clashes with Jack's right-hand man, a skilled swordsman named Kurogane, while Sanji and Nami team up to fend off the rest of the crew. Brook and Jimbe take on the remaining henchmen with their unique fighting styles, leaving Luffy to face off against Jack himself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs the Straw Hats face off against the corrupt businessman and his henchmen, Pete sacrifices himself to save the crew from a barrage of bullets. The Straw Hats are devastated by the loss, but they use the memory of Pete's sacrifice to push forward and defeat the enemy. Jack laughs as he unleashes his powerful elephant zoan devil fruit abilities, but Luffy remains unfazed. With a smirk, Luffy delivers his signature one-liner, \"I am Luffy, and I am Luffy!\" He then stretches his arm back and releases a powerful Gomu Gomu no Elephant Gun, propelling himself forward and slamming his fist directly into Jack's chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe force of the attack sends Jack flying back, and he crashes into a nearby mountain, defeated. The Straw Hats cheer as Luffy lands gracefully back on the ground, a victorious grin on his face. Jill has tears of joy while thanking him. \"Don't worry, that was too easy\" he declares smiling, as the crew celebrates their victory.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut as they prepare to leave the island, they discover a poneglyph hidden among the ruins. Robin quickly deciphers the message, revealing that it contains information about the ancient weapons that could destroy the world. The crew realizes that their journey is far from over, and they set sail once again, ready to face whatever challenges lie ahead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n As the battle ends and the Straw Hats emerge victorious, they are ambushed by a group of Marines led by an admiral named Fujitora, who had been sent to apprehend them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChapter 6: Departure\n\nAs the Straw Hats depart from Deadwood, they feel a sense of accomplishment for freeing the town from tyranny. However, their victory is short-lived as they are suddenly ambushed by the Marines. Just as they are about to be captured, they are saved by the unexpected arrival of Shanks and his crew, who have been secretly watching over them. Shanks reveals that he had been investigating the corrupt businessman and his ties to the Marines, and decided to intervene to help the Straw Hats. The crew is shocked but grateful for his help.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater, as they set sail, they reflect on their experiences on Deadwood. They remember the sacrifice of their ally, Pete, who bravely sacrificed himself to save the town. However, to their surprise, they receive a message from Pete himself, revealing that he had actually survived the explosion and was recovering in a nearby town. The crew is overjoyed to hear this news, and they vow to meet with him again someday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs they continue on their journey, they look towards the horizon, eager to face their next adventure and overcome whatever challenges come their way.",

        "text": "Sorry for the length, just a lot to say lol. To elaborate, before I started one piece, I was not a big fan of the “coward character” trope, so I wasn’t really looking forward to Usopp, until Arlong Park. It was so satisfying to watch him realize that he can’t just keep playing pirate and keep running and has to actually put his life on the life for his friends as everyone else is. He finds brave role models in the giants, and then in Alabasta, he fights his own battle with Chopper and defends Luffy’s dream. That’s good stuff right there. All the way he’s proving he can be brave and the cold reality sets in in Water 7 that he can’t keep up and is gonna be left behind just like Merry, and then has to be brave in a different way by asking for forgiveness. And then Thriller Bark he fights a fight he knows only he can win. I won’t go too much into that part now bc I don’t want this to be so lengthy but needless to say I absolutely love his development from start to finish. Until time skip. I can’t help but feel like he’s reliving the arlong treatment like, EVERY arc now. Big enemy shows up, he gets scared, runs and practically almost abandons everyone and then gets the courage to fight. I get he was vital in Dressrosa with defeating Sugar, but the running and basically giving the finger to the Tontattas and Robin (I know he couldn’t remember her but still the tontattas were still their friends) and leaving them to die, really feels like 2 steps forward, 8 steps back. And now in Wano, he is crying and telling Nami to denounce their captain like ???? Wtf bro!? In Alabasta you were in the SAME situation and now you want her to do the opposite of what you did? Idk it kinda sucks but I really liked him but still do.",

        "text": "I’m talking about Crocodile being the **mastermind** behind the kidnapping of Dr.Vegapunk plot that has been playing out for several chapters now. With his Mini-me, Seraphim, S-Croc, being the one who just assassinated Shaka in Chapter 1077:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sryawtew8jna1.png?width=825&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=be1892c4c53f483be2fce121c14d2d1e27ae0cef\n\nI first touched on the idea of Crocodile wanting to kidnap Vegapunk in my last post, “[When the Side Hustle Goes Wrong](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/11g53k4/when_the_side_hustle_goes_wrong_chapter_1076/)”. There, I pointed out some potential clues and came up with an idea on how Croc may be trying to pull this off. With his end-goal being World Domination, of course. You know, typical Bond-Villain stuff?\n\nAnd as One Piece’s Bond Villain, I’d think Crocodile would have his eyes on the world’s top scientist. Since he had failed to get Pluton back in Alabasta, the next best thing would be to kidnap the scientist who has been developing advanced weaponry for the World Government. \n\nDuring this past week, I’ve gotten a few new ideas that I’d like to share. Hope you enjoy!\n\n  \n\n# S-Croc, the Triggerman\n\nIf Vegapunk did indeed create a Crocodile Seraphim, there is a good chance he tried to replicate Croc’s sand-logia powers for it. But failed based on what he said in Chapter 1070 about his research into Logia Devil Fruits:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/as7yfpmc9jna1.png?width=200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=98eea5300ce9b20af47f0e1cbee07b64343c1bbf\n\nAs a result, Vegapunk may’ve written S-Croc off as a failure. Decommissioned him and set him off to the side somewhere. That could be why we haven’t seen any action from the S-Croc Seraphim. Yet.\n\nI’m thinking there are multiple traitors in this plot. Possibly, a traitor Vegapunk-Satellite was the one to bring S-Croc back to life just for this mission. Then later, I’m sure Crocodile will get a kick of his own personal Seraphim. \n\nWho better to trust than a clone of himself?\n\nThough, one important thing to note is that if Vegapunk did try to give the S-Croc sand-logia powers, then the seraphim wouldn’t have any powers that actually work. He might have the green-blood, but he can’t produce or manipulate sand like the real Crocodile. \n\nSo, this might be something of a handicap for S-Croc. But he still might’ve gotten something useful from his primary lineage factor source. \n\nBefore Crocodile got his Sand-Sand Fruit, I’m thinking that he was a semi-decent marksman as a child. Per the sketch Oda did in [SBS Vol. 63](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/SBS_Volume_63#Chapter_618,_Page_80):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xpe5f6wv9jna1.png?width=387&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8de22c723807adb0a1edc162680c6e1846b4278f\n\n  \n\nAt least a decent enough marksman to pull off a brutal headshot from a distance:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5akq3vpy9jna1.png?width=775&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=221812c5e70a571a9b04fa7823bd8c2838dc3067\n\nAnother thing to note is that Stella-Vegapunk didn’t seem surprised that Shaka brought some “help” to set him free. Meaning that Stella should recognize the person following Shaka. \n\nThe other Vegapunk Satellites are kinda busy at the moment. There still may be a traitor, or traitors, among them. But for now, they are all with the Straw Hats. However, the mystery shooter might be a Seraphim we haven’t been introduced to yet. \n\nI’m thinking S-Croc. \n\nS-Bat (Moria) &amp; S-Bird? (Doflamingo) are other possibilities. However, with Moria and Doflamingo being Paramecia Devil Fruit Users, Vegapunk shouldn’t have had an issue replicating their devil-fruit powers. So, surely, either S-Bat or S-Bird would have had far more effective means to kill Shaka than an old school gun. It’s possible they would want to use a gun for dramatic effect. But for S-Croc, a gun is his only real means of attack.\n\nLike the real Crocodile, what S-Croc lacks in brawn, he might just make for in brains.\n\nWhile Crocodile is a brawler, he works better as a criminal mastermind operating from the shadows. Remember Baroque Works? And I think Croc is up to his old tricks again with the Cross Guild. His Mini-me, S-Croc, may just be his newest assassin. \n\nS-Croc may’ve gotten his marching orders from Stussy or from a traitor-Vegapunk. Somebody that would be loyal to the Cross Guild. Or Crocodile, directly.\n\nNevertheless, I think there is something more than a simple murder-mystery plot afoot. Rather, I’m thinking there’s a Bond-level evil conspiracy going on. \n\nAnd who better to pull it off than the Bond Villain of One Piece?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/asqlnpacajna1.png?width=861&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7913aa065c6b9a174f7e2cffaff236f055803f97\n\n  \n\n# Diamonds Are Forever\n\nThe whole diamonds-reveal in Chapter 1075 is what got me thinking of the old Bond films. *Diamonds Are Forever* is a Bond film that came out in the 1970s, by the way. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cfj4bawlajna1.png?width=863&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3145915fe144807ec8d61f96f2dc7573a4ffb797\n\nEdison had mentioned that the diamonds produced in the Lab are for industrial purposes. And I think I figured out what their main industrial purpose is:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zq7w7anoajna1.png?width=889&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d632258d6b0d96f9592525bd036483a2e8e020dd\n\nVegapunk seems to have done a lot of research with Kizaru’s light-logia, too. While he couldn’t replicate it exactly, he might’ve come close with the use of diamonds.\n\nIn the Bond film, *Diamonds Are Forever*, diamonds were used to turn light into a high-powered laser cannon:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img obkmfmdtajna1...*\n\nIf Crocodile had a spy inside of Vegapunk’s lab, it’s possible that he could’ve gotten his hand on plans behind the Pacifista’s laser technology. And he could’ve spent some time during the timeskip to build his own laser cannon. If so, he would need Vegapunk to commission it. Hence, the kidnapping plot.\n\nOr Crocodile could be waiting until he has successfully kidnapped Vegapunk to get to work on building this satellite laser cannon.\n\nIf constructing a laser cannon does turn out to be part of Crocodile’s latest grand plan, that might just give the Straw Hats an excuse to go to outer space.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dsp5kj10bjna1.png?width=983&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=11a9526c6e8f892bcde6f695e5cf70aaa28942df\n\nAlthough, Crocodile may just plan to mount a laser cannon on a ship. To make a makeshift version of Pluton. Assuming the ancient weapon is a warship. \n\nAnyways, Vegapunk would be an invaluable asset for a criminal mastermind for Crocodile to have. Not just for a laser cannon. But to develop and build all sorts of technologically advanced weaponry. Which really, is the ancient technology Crocodile wanted in the first place. \n\nVegapunk has been building on research he was able to uncover from the Void Century, with the Ancient Kingdom being something of a technological utopia.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7uu0k4b9bjna1.png?width=622&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=459c05a7065a35122050f4cd76f6e5ef1f652a1f\n\nTo limit what the best in science has to offer to only the Cross Guild, Crocodile may have already reached out to Vegapunk’s former colleagues.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mtnrot9tbjna1.png?width=567&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=aac2817ae5c3274659d09f2a4f54c8da7aed175a\n\nBest to have all of the world's leading scientists under one organization.\n\nThe Germa 66’s Cover Story Arc took some place in the not-so-distant past. By now, I’m sure Caesar &amp; Judge have made nice. Their shared hatred of Vegapunk bonding them together. \n\nWith it being the Final Saga, I see them allying with an Emperor to not diverge too much from the main plot of the series. Right now, “Emperor Buggy” is hiring. \n\nOf course, neither may not be too happy with working with Vegapunk again. But with Crocodile as the boss, he’s not going to pick favorites. Vegapunk won’t be placed on a pedestal as he was with the World Government. Which is likely what caused Judge &amp; Caesar to resent him. And Crocodile will likely cater to Judge &amp; Caesar’s egos by allowing them to conduct whatever research they want. No matter how unethical. So long as it furthers his goals for ultimate power.\n\nAnother little theory that I have is that Crocodile was a former protégé of Du Feld’s, the Loan Shark King. So, maybe Crocodile isn’t a complete stranger to the former MADS scientists? If not, he may already be aware of all of their personality flaws. And knows just how to work past them.\n\nBut I guess we’ll see.\n\n  \n\n# Conclusion\n\nGoing into the Final Saga of One Piece, I don’t see a whole lot of hype for the Cross Guild. Which is unfortunate. \n\nYeah, Crocodile got defeated by Luffy early on in the series. But Croc seems to be a villain who learns from his past mistakes and comes back even harder. \n\nWhen he got his ass kicked by Whitebeard twenty-odd years ago, he changed tactics to try to obtain Pluton. Then, when that failed, well…I’m assuming that he’s now rounding up the world’s leading scientist to build up an arsenal of advanced weaponry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[  ](https://preview.redd.it/1buughebcjna1.png?width=536&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=86b6b671c017b1d2524eed009892d4f38ee462bc)\n\nThe MADS crew will be back together again, minus Queen. And then there’s the clone-Stussy taking the place of the real one. But once again, MADS will be financed by a wealthy criminal to conduct their research. For “peace”. \n\nLet’s call it **Operation: Utopia 2.0**.\n\nClone-Stussy was likely the one to leak it to the World Government that Vegapunk was researching the poneglyphs. Which led to Cipher Pol Agents opening up an investigation on Egghead Island.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/74z68ncgcjna1.png?width=481&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2ddaff3b89595236dc4a3a27ac2d55c59bcb3be2\n\nBut at least one traitor Vegapunk-satellite had to have captured and locked up any Cipher Pol Agents who sailed close to the island. Without letting Stella-Vegapunk know so that he wouldn’t get spooked and try to run away before the time was right. Not before a fleet of Marine warships would be on their way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o4iyvyblcjna1.png?width=875&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8f449e60cf0af2103a7402617719e48ea34e20ad\n\nThe original plan must’ve just been to make a quick getaway once Egghead gets blown up in a sort-of Buster Call.\n\nPreferably, in a Bond Villain style escape pod. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0kmaeyspcjna1.png?width=539&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e2673b930d81ede588092916b4169d26f205a939\n\nThe Straw Hats surprise visit to the island doesn’t really change things. If anything, the Straw Hats might end up being the ones who get blamed for the mayhem unfolding on Egghead.\n\nI’m almost damn sure Stussy was the one who called Big News Morgans about the Straw Hats clashing with the World Government on the island.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lsu6xlnucjna1.png?width=550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c0cd2d40f2f78fdb7538d20e99d7a34e56b0d618\n\nThis news story will cause the world to blame the Straw Hats for Vegapunk’s disappearance. Rather than him having been kidnapped in an operation orchestrated by the Cross Guild. \n\nPure evil, I tell ya.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nx7y1dd1djna1.png?width=631&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ad5d60a74951e637160659e96e20f604a183b38f\n\nAnd that’s not even getting into how Caribou might fit into all of this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/53wix164djna1.png?width=680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3f8715ddc2004dc13ea7248aca79fb40a14c161d\n\nCaribou has been MIA for who knows how long. Since before the Fishman Island Arc, the guy has been having all sorts of misadventures.\n\nBut since the Straw Hats kicked him off the Sunny, he might be open to tagging along with whatever evil scheme the Cross Guild might have going on. Whether or not that “Certain Someone” was Crocodile all along. The swampy dude just needs a ride off of Egghead. Especially, before all hell breaks loose. \n\nThis last chapter is seriously hinting towards Buster-Call levels of destruction is imminent:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/skikjud8djna1.png?width=861&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=21c97a304d85ce1569bd7179d83f6cb76fa67962\n\nI’m really liking the tension being built up in this arc. Whether I'm right or wrong. Egghead has been turning out to be a fun little adventure. Much like a Bond film. ;)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# TL;DR: \n\nS-Croc was the one who shot Shaka. As part of the Cross Guild’s plan to kidnap Vegapunk. If Crocodile had a leak within Vegapunk’s lab, he might’ve gotten his hand on Vegapunk’s research involving laser technology, which I believe utilizes diamonds. Crocodile might have, or might be, constructing a laser cannon to launch into space. That may just give the Straw Hats an excuse to go up there. Judge &amp; Ceaser may have recently been recruited into the Cross Guild. Still, Crocodile wants Vegapunk. To have all the world’s leading scientists under him. Stussy is still suspect. Likely, to switch sides again. This time, for the Cross Guild. Where she is playing a major role in this plot to kidnap her creator and to have the Straw Hats blamed for his disappearance. \n\nBond-Villain Level Evil Conspiracy is afoot on Egghead. I will call it **Operation: Utopia 2.0**.",
