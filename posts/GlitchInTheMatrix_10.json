Except I wasn't knocked out and the car went straight through me. Except there was no car. All three of these things happened at once like a twisted Schrödinger's cat. I know for a fact I was knocked out, because people had to wake me up. But also, I know for a fact that the car went through me, because I saw what was on the back left seat and I was fine. But I also know that there was no car, because the street was empty before and after and I wasn't knocked out. As you can probably tell this is quite difficult to comprehend, and even harder to explain, so I'm sorry if you've gotten confused. But that was definitely some kind of glitch.",

It happened a couple months ago so I might have cleared my calls out.\n\nTo begin, I got a new phone in March, which came with a new number. \n\nAll was well. I finally had a functioning phone. Nice.\n\nUntil a couple months later when I began getting the usual spam calls, most of which were from \"prophet manasseh\". Whatever. I just let them ring. \n\nTo set the scene, it was around 4am and I was in my kitchen playing with one of my cats. My phone begins to vibrate. I look at who's calling and it says \"J------- B------\" (not revealing my name cause I'm paranoid, but rest assured that it was my name.)\n\nNow on the Galaxy S9, you can set your own contact photo. The caller's photo was my contact photo. (a photo of my dog in a dress.. for shits and giggles..) And it was coming from my number. Same area code, same 4 digits.\n\nI dismissed the call but didn't fail to recognize the oddity of the situation. \n\nMy question for you, reddit, is what was this? Just another spam call? Or something more? If I can find the call, I'll post a screenshot. For now just take my word for it.",

Not as good as the first one and I clearly remembered it had no tablet function rubber and the name of other department. I thought to myself, I wish this was as useful as the other one. But never ever gave it a thought again. Today, I went through this company stuff, and I have 2 pens exactly the same. As the first one. Same department and everything.

I see an older chick in a blue and white sundress, something like a phone in one hand, held to her ear, and an obvious key fob in the other. She had her back turned, walking the same direction as my car lane. \n\nI got curious, as I do when bored on the road, so I gazed over at her. But something felt uneasy. As soon as I passed, I glanced in my rear view. I found out why. She had her back turned. In what took less than a second, she somehow managed to turn and keep going the same pace. I don't buy it. \n\nAnother interesting note I've made. Her phone was initially in her right hand, keys in left as she swung her arm by her side. I didn't pay attention to their orientation in the mirror, but as I made my turn, I looked to my right and noticed they were reversed. Phone in left hand, keys in right. As if real life itself were a mirror. But she was the only thing reversed in real life. I'm still shaken up about this simple encounter.",

It was slow today at around 4pm and it was just me and my coworker working in the box. An elderly lady then came up to me, purchased her ticket, and then afterwards took out her rewards card and asked me to add the points. I took it to the back computer to put the points on. As the computer was processing the transaction, I was looking at the reflection in the backwindow and i could see the elderly women patiently waiting. Then, out of nowhere, her face turns dead straight and she bangs her head straight into the window (looked like she was possessed or something insane) and then pulled her head back and continued patiently waiting as if nothing happened. It made an extremely loud noise and when i turned around i could visibly see the glass vibrating from how hard she hit it. I go back to her and give her the tickets and say \"Ma'am are you alright?\" and she looks at me confused and goes \"What do you mean?\". I ask her \"did you just hit your head on the wall?\" and she looks even more puzzled before responding that she was just waiting this entire time and had not hit her head at all. I gave her the tidkets and she went inside. I turn to my coworker and say something like \"you see that shit??\". She looks at me even more confused than the women and says that she did not hear anything nor see anything even though she was sitting probably 5 feet from where the women was and would have absolutely heard or would have seen it. Now I feel like I'm going absolutely insane but I am absolutely sure without a doubt that I witnessed this happening. The vibrating of the glass made it all too real.",

The girl completely changed. It would have made me feel better if she didnt change back because then I’d be like okay maybe I just never knew what she looked like or something. no she changed BACK. I watched the Truman Show and my only explantion until simulation theory was maybe my life is a tv show and at that moment that actress wasnt available lmaoo. Ive never had any incidents after this. Ive never done drugs, I dont drink. I have a great memory and never forget a face. But this was unexplainable to me and I was always afraid to tell someone because theyd think I’m crazy. \n\nThoughts? ",

        "text": "OK, this is my true story. I was travelling from Detroit to Charleston. I had helped a friend reconnect with his family. We spent Thanksgiving with his mother, for the first time in 15 years.\n\nWe leave Detroit, and start heading back to Charleston. We were quite a bit into the drive, i decided to smoke a bowl and take a nap.  Now, it's maybe 10 or 11 pm. I nod off for just a min, and have what i can only call a vision. I saw a blue car pass on our left, a silver car, a motorcycle, and finally a cop car. no big deal.  About 60 seconds after the cop car passes, 6 deer dart across the interstate. the blue car escapes,  silver car swerves and hits a deer, and his car starts flipping. The motorcyclist was hit by a deer, and thrown to the ground. In only a moment he was under our car, thump thump. and then 1 last deer darts into the road, we hit it, and it comes right thru the windshield.  I SAT STRAIGHT UP, and went   oh shit Jeff !!!!!  did you just see that????    He laughs and said  \"see what\"?  I explained  what i had just seen,  he laughed like hell at me, and called me a pothead.\n\nI couldn't shake the dream i had.  So I sat up, and continued with the trip.  About 15 mins later,  I look to the left, and My vision becomes reality. I see the same blue Sedan,  followed by the same silver Honda.  No big deal.   Now here comes the blue crotch rocket, and I was like  UMMMMMM Jeff?&gt;?&gt;?&gt;  are you seeing this?  He said  I see it,  he started slowing down,  the cop car passed us, and he slowed more,  and  just like I saw in the dream,  here came the deer.EVERYTHING WAS THE SAME, but  we had slowed down, so we dodged the motorcyclist, and only clipped the last deer ourselves.  I was like  HOLY SHIT BROOOOOO,  we gotta stop. He said  FUCK NO,  pulled 2 exits down, pulled into a hotel. Got outta the car and screamed at me, \"I WILL NEVER RIDE WITH YOU AFTER DARK AGAIN.  WTF WAS THAT?\"  We pulled off the bumper and went to sleep. and finished our trip  the next day.  He never rode with me in the car again after dark.  Hel,l he hasn't spoken to me in 9 years.\n\nsoooo    what are your thoughts?",

        "text": "I’m not sure if this is where it belongs, but figured it would be a good starting place at least! \nSo recently my grandmother suffered from a Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (The widow maker) as it burst in her abdomen, and we didn’t think she would survive. She is 82 and by some miracle pulled through, she was on the East Coast about to head back to Az here and she was an hour away from getting in the plane. Had she not started getting symptoms (throwing up violently on the way to the airport) she would have died on that very flight back home. Although this isn’t even one of the odd experiences I’m referring to. Although this was a major thing in itself!\nAs she was healing up here at my parents place I was just casually watching tv and talking with my mom about everything that happened and my mom told me about how she lost 1850cc of blood and was close to losing too much to be kept alive. The SECOND she got done telling me this, a commercial for some coffee I’ve never heard of came on TV. The brand name of that coffee? 1850 coffee. I was blown away and so was my mother. I couldn’t believe the odds of that happening right then and there. There was also another minor one regarding a show we were watching about people that build houses out in nature using only the materials around them and some other odd occurrence happened but can’t rememwbr exactly what it was.\n\nNot to detract from that but I had a dream just last night about being in some college campus that happened to have some sort of casino in one of the buildings and at one point I started randomly playing a slot machine where I was winning a LOT of money almost each turn. For whatever reason I had to go but tried going back to try it again but when I went back it was closed because I was there at 8am and the casino didn’t open until 10pm (weird I know, but most dreams are) so anyways I’ve always thought of premonitions and things of that nature as I happened to have one the other day when I dreamt I had a pee test that next morning and sure enough I actually did! Seems like me dreams lately have been giving me some signs and certain clues to pay attention to. Now am I expecting to head to the casino and hit it big, no not really. But are those numbers 1850 going to be important to me in the near future? Should I go buy a lotto ticket and play 1,8,5,18, etc. lol I’m not sure. But I’m starting to really pay attention to details now in my dreams and in life.\nAnyways sorry for the long rambling post and if you made it through thank you for reading! Would love to hear everyone’s input on this!",

It actually had me believing that it happened, or...will happen.\n\nDisclaimer. I am NOT being racist. I am, myself, a Caucasian male.\n\nIt started with a card game. I didn't recognize it, but it resembled Uno, I believe. It was between a darker-skinned family containing a sister, a mother, a brother, a young child, and me. It was just going completely normal. Then, realization hit.\n\nThe room itself, had a brown couch, and brown decorative items. The mother was on the couch, in front of a wide window. I couldn't see beyond it. It was either too bright, or too foggy. Looking on at the rest of the dream, it may have been too foggy. The rest of the room, there was a small table with a lamp. It was off. There was a TV stand with an off TV. Looking at the TV, turning right led to a door into another room. I don't know what it was. I didn't look up in time.\n\nNow. At realization, whoever I was...me? Them? I'm going to call them vessel. Vessel stood up, panicked, turned around, doubled over against the wall next to the television. They felt like they were about to vomit. Memory of my life flashed slowly into their head, until they remembered. They listed names of others to prove that they had these memories. The mother said something. I don't know what. Then, vessel was in the school.\n\n It was my school. A nice school. But here, it was falling apart, and dark. All I saw was the cafeteria. The halls outside were dark, and again, I couldn't see beyond the doors leading outside. I think it was fog. In the cafeteria, it was dark. A lot of the lights weren't functional. Just a few where we got food. What I knew, I was carrying a food tray. Apparently, word quickly got out about my occurrence. I talked to a pair of friends that I didn't recognize. I don't know what was said. It was mostly that, and then I woke up.\n\nWhat I remember learning at some points was that it was 2019. That is all, I believe...memory is still insufficient.",

This was the first time I ever experienced something like that. \n\nI'm driving home in my pickup after work today when suddenly I noticed in my backview mirror there was this vertical square of rainbow waves that was rotating towards rainbow squares and then hexagons and back to waves. So it's general outline shape was in like 12x24 it stayed in that frame changing shapes inside itself but always stayed in the rainbow spectrum. I instictly turned around to my back seat  to see and I saw it there in the middle either hovering or sitting I couldn't tell. It was starting to blind me like you would see a bright light and I suddenly felt like time was slowing down.\n\nThere was no presence from it,  I didn't feel I was looking at anything but it was still there yet not there, I had no particular emotions while looking at it because I think my brain was not processing what I was seeing. After a bit it just disappeared and everything went back to normal.\n\nAll in all this confused the shit out of me.\n\nThought it could go on this sub or something. If anyone know or heard of a similar encounter or experience let me know cause now I'm curious.",

One of them was a Battle Growlers Spinosaurus. I would've got it, but I went there to get something else. Let's fast forward to present day. I was looking at the pictures of the old Jurassic Park 2k9 toys (I collect those BTW) and to my shock, a spinosaurus battle growler never existed! I am very urprised about this. It was DEFINATELY a battle growler (I could tell from the box art) and I very highly doubt that I imagined it.",

        "text": "First time poster but I've had this experience had a few times throughout the last year especially having to do with my girlfriend. I can only explain this as stronger than a 'gut feeling' but not quite absolute knowledge. Its like getting a really strong feeling about something happening and then it actually happening. I wouldnt say quite predictive but almost like a sense about knowldege that shouldnt be known to me but it is. An example:\n\nI was at work yesterday and i was organizing some things and just off in my head and I started thinking about how my girlfriend had just gotten home (she had text me a few hours previous that she had arrived home) and I knew she would let our dog out which started getting me worried that she was going to fall asleep with him out and he was going to destroy stuff ( this has happened before because he is a puppy and a mini aussie so he get mischeveous when he gets bored ) since she had gotten up at 4:30 and she worked and then went to class so I figured as most people would be tired and seeing how in the past she has neglected to put him away when she starts getting tired i thought id text her and ask her (she had gotten home at 4 and i had left before that and decided to do this around 6ish) to put him away before she falls asleep. Whats weird about this is i had a split second motivation to call her as I had a feeling she was asleep turns out literally as she was falling alseep on the couch she got a call from me. I didnt think much of it at the time but after thinkong more about it was oddly exact. Now normally I could easily chalk it up to coincidince or intuition but ive had more similar experiences that make it a lot harder to. \n\nAnother example:\nSometime during winter (this has happened multiple times but this is the most recent memorable one) we had both been up super late lime 1am and my gf friend needed to open both of us were sleep deprived so we both slept through her alarms. I remember I was dreaming I dont remember what it was about but i just remember clear as day out of nowhere being overwhelmed with concern and I thought to myself something is up I need to wake up now and I quite literally jumped to completely awake and I grabbed my phone and checked it and it was 4:40. For context girlfirend works approximatetly 10 minites from work so she usually left at 4:50ish. I woke her up and she ended up making it to work exactly on time. It was odd \n\nAnother example:\nYesterday morning I woke,myself up. It was extremely bizaree because I was asleep not even sure if I was dreaming and I suddenly thought 'you need to get up' and I opened my eyes and i looked at my phone and it was 5 am on the fucking nose. \n\nI mever really was sure how this happens so I aas wonderong maybe you guys could make sense of it ",
