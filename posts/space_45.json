What if it’s not our second home but the first.\n\nI recently stumbled upon a map of Mars on the internet, it showed the great martian sea, and places like Olympus, it could’ve been fictional but it made me think what if we all are just looking at Mars the wrong way.\n\nMaybe, the people on Mars actually were so advanced that when Mars started becoming cold, they fled Mars and came to earth where they crash landed and only a few people survived? And that crash landing killed the dinosaurs and out of were the ones who remained alive\n\nMaybe they stored all their research in a book and now that book is known as the Bible or Bhagwad Gita? What if all those great scholars tell the tales of the Martians and those Martians taught them, What if we all are the descendants of some people from outerspace who came to earth to start from scratch after their original home was destroyed.\n\nWhat if Mount Olympus, and many other locations that we have only heard or read about actually existed? What if Zeus or Other gods were just Martians who were so advanced in their technology?\n\n\nIndian book Ramayana mentions Ravana having a vehicle called Pushpak Vimaan which could fly, a Vehicle that could do what we are striving to do now in those ancient times.\n\n\nI know this sounds fascinating but it leads to the question if not Mars, which planet could be our Third home?",

These planets, named GJ 1002 b and c, have the potential for liquid water on their surface and lie within the habitable zone of their star.\n\nThis discovery is not only exciting for the possibilities of extraterrestrial life, but also brings up important questions about the habitability of red dwarf stars. While these stars tend to flare frequently in their youth, they are smaller, cooler, and far longer-lived than stars like our Sun. The close proximity of these two planets to their star raises questions about the effect of these flares on their atmospheres.\n\nWhat do you think about this discovery and its implications for the search for life beyond our solar system? Let's start a discussion and share our thoughts.\n\nRemember to keep it respectful and on topic, and upvote and comment on others' posts to keep the conversation going.\n\nThanks for being a part of the /r/space community!",

        "text": "Title: Unifying Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity: A New Approach\n\nIntroduction: Quantum mechanics and general relativity are two of the most successful theories in modern physics. They have been extensively tested and validated through numerous experiments and observations, and they form the cornerstone of our understanding of the universe. Despite their success, these two theories are fundamentally incompatible and cannot be reconciled within a single framework. The search for a theory that unifies quantum mechanics and general relativity, known as quantum gravity, has been ongoing for several decades.\n\nQuantum mechanics is the theory that describes the behavior of matter and energy at the quantum level, and it has been highly successful in explaining a wide range of phenomena, including the behavior of atoms and subatomic particles. On the other hand, general relativity is the theory of gravity, and it describes how massive objects, such as planets and stars, curve spacetime and cause the phenomenon of gravity. However, when attempting to apply the principles of quantum mechanics to the description of gravity, many problems arise. For example, general relativity predicts that spacetime is smooth and continuous, while quantum mechanics predicts that spacetime is quantized and made up of discrete units.\n\nBody: In this thesis, I present a new approach to unifying quantum mechanics and general relativity. This approach is based on the idea of emergent gravity. The idea behind emergent gravity is that the phenomenon of gravity arises from the interactions of more fundamental quantum entities, such as particles and fields, in the same way that thermodynamics emerges from the interactions of individual atoms and molecules.\n\nThe basic idea is that spacetime is not an intrinsic property of the universe, but is instead emergent from the interactions of more fundamental entities. The interactions between these entities lead to the formation of structures, such as particles and fields, which in turn lead to the formation of spacetime. The idea of emergent spacetime has been proposed in several different forms, including loop quantum gravity and string theory, but my approach is based on a novel formulation that has not been widely explored.\n\nIn my approach, I propose that spacetime is emergent from the interactions between quantized units of spacetime, which I refer to as spacetime quanta. These spacetime quanta are similar to the quanta of matter and energy, and they are the fundamental building blocks of spacetime. The interactions between spacetime quanta lead to the formation of spacetime, and the spacetime quanta themselves are subject to quantum mechanical principles, such as the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.\n\nThe interactions between spacetime quanta also give rise to the phenomenon of gravity. In this approach, gravity is not a force, as it is in general relativity, but is instead an emergent property of the interactions between spacetime quanta. This is similar to the way that electromagnetic forces arise from the interactions between charged particles.\n\nResults: I have applied this approach to a range of phenomena, including the behavior of massive objects in the presence of gravity, and I have obtained results that are consistent with both quantum mechanics and general relativity. For example, I have calculated the motion of a massive object in a gravitational field, and I have found that the motion is consistent with the predictions of general relativity. In addition, I have studied the quantum mechanical behavior of spacetime quanta, and I have found that the spacetime quanta are subject to the same quantum mechanical principles that govern the behavior of matter and energy.\n\nConclusion: This new approach provides a promising solution to the long-standing problem of unifying quantum mechanics and general relativity. Although further testing and refinement will be necessary to fully validate this approach, I believe that it holds great potential for advancing our understanding of the nature of space, time,and gravity. If confirmed, this new approach could provide a comprehensive framework for explaining a wide range of phenomena and deepen our understanding of the universe. It may also open new avenues for research and development in fields such as cosmology, quantum computing, and quantum field theory. In conclusion, the idea of emergent gravity as a new approach to unifying quantum mechanics and general relativity is a promising direction for future research and exploration.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/10sje6l/would_the_universe_still_exist_if_there_was/",
        "text": "If life of any kind had never developed in our universe, would it still have existed? Its mysteries and beauty locked away never to be discovered or even witnessed. \n\nThe quick answer is yes, the universe is not defined by the requirement of life to observe it. At least not by a third dimensional perspective. But there's a flaw in the quick answer. Because life is not a divine phenomenon completely detached from the universe itself. It's the complete opposite in fact. The materials that make up your blood running through your veins right now were present during the Big Bang, we know that. Our universe does not allow information to be created or destroyed, only transformed. Therefore we and the universe are one. We are the universe witnessing itself. By removing human arrogance from the equation we can go back to the first question. Would the universe exist if there was no universe to witness it? Can a thing exist and not exist at the same time? Can a thing sprout from nothing? No, it can't. \n\nWe, the universe, then cannot say that the universe has existed forever. Because it could not have been created from nothing. Therefore a new question, who or what witnessed us into existence? A story cannot exist without a beginning, the same a way a story will never end if it has never begun. That means our universe is not a beginning, it's a continuation of a story. And if information can truly, never, under no circumstances be created or destroyed, then we are not from this universe either. \n\nIf we are not from this universe then that opens up a new myriad of questions. Now we must look into the method of transportation, how did we arrive here? Black holes are a good start. Black holes are a warp in spacetime, an anomaly, and the more we try to understand it the more our math breaks down. The same way our math breaks down when we attempt to see beyond the Big Bang. It is the black hole's nature to break down logic and the rules of the universe. What if a black hole breaks the universe down to its very seams with such violence that when the black hole spills it out, it rewrites the very laws and foundation of a universe, creating a new one? That would make our universe like a branch of a tree. \n\nThe tree analogy is not correct though. The multiverse is not a road that keeps splitting into new roads. Instead, every time a universe creates a new road it completely rewrites the rules of that previous one to create the new road. And from that new road you would not be able to look back and see the road you were previously on. If you were born on that new road without any knowledge of the way the universe worked you would never know there were countless roads just out of reach. The previous road might even be flourishing like never before and you would never know. Even if you tried to cross the threshold into the previous road it would mean to break apart and rewrite everything that is... you. It would still be you, just in a completely different way. \n\nThe multiverse is a network of independent entries and plot lines that continue to expand the original story. But a plot line can die without ending the story. A universe dies when every last black hole in it evaporates and the universe has expanded so much that a particle would never be able witness another. If information cannot be destroyed on any universe then we have been around since the very first one. A universe that allows information to be created then sent away to expand and sprout into new universes. If that information is finite and nothing is ever able to escape entropy then perhaps even the multiverse will die. With each split into a new universe, less and less information gets passed down into the next one. Until one day there is no more information to be passed on and nothing to witness. All doors will close and every room will become too vast to ever be allowed to witness anything ever again. Would the multiverse still exist then? Can death and an ending be two different things? Could the garden of the multiverse still be considered alive if every plant has withered away and it is now nothing more than a graveyard? Is to exist to be alive? Or is it to be alive to exist? If to exist is to be, then what are you when every purpose and every meaning has been stripped away from your being? Are you nothing then? Were you ever something? Were you ever alive? Can you ever truly give meaning to something if it is that thing's destiny to fade away into nothing? Are you even real?",

I can barely remember now what null space was, except that once you were inside it, you ceased to exist from the standpoint of anyone still in spacetime, so they would not know what happened to you or be able to rescue you. This, I guess, means that once in null space you are not connected to any point(s) in spacetime.",
