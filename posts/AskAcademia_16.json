Given what I'd like to research, it would make sense for me to spend at least a few months there, if not an entire semester or more*, but I haven't got the slightest idea of how this would work - would I be able to get additional funding? Can I search for external funding? Would my program even allow it? And so on\n\nThought I'd ask on here to see what others' experiences have been with doing research in another country. Any insights (or advice) are appreciated\n\n* &gt;!For context, I am half-Tunisian who has been to the country numerous times before (and even lived and worked there for a spell a while ago. My family owns an apartment there, so rent and basic necessities wouldn't be an issue)!&lt;",

So academia has been a huge transition to me. I won't lie, one of my biggest motivation to pursue PhD in the US was because I wanted to get out of my country. And I didn't get any master's scholarship (nor had money to pursue that), so once I was offered fully funded PhD program, I took the opportunity.\n\nNow it's my third year - I'm technically half way through my program. However, I haven't made any accomplishments. I haven't had a single paper published (or even accepted), I recently got rejected for the biggest conference in my field ( I submitted two papers after months and months of hardwork), and both were rejected. I see my peers going to the conferences, publishing in journals, working as editors etc. whereas I'm just someone who barely got by with the coursework etc. I also joined in middle of the pandemic and so most of my program was online (despite living in America).\n\nI totally feel like a loser. I feel depressed that for some reason it is so difficult for me to perform as an academic. It's my 3rd year and I have zero achievements to show. No prizes, no conferences, no publications... nothing.\n\nI feel very low in my confidence because of that. I feel like an imposter and never a true academic. I think it might be apparent for people that I only took this opportunity to come to the US. My situation also worries me for my future because with this profile, I don't think I'll be able to find a job in the US. I'm already thinking about my possible options moving forward (maybe an academic job in my country?) or transitioning to industry in the US. Please suggest any thing I can do to change my situation. I'll try my best..",

It's basically more than 10 times as beneficial to be a full time private tutor than a researcher. So, that's why I've decided to relocate and look for a better place, since I, obviously, spent more than 10 years on my degrees and so on. \n\nThe problem is, my friends, who had already moved abroad, told me that it's approximately the same everywhere, and you cannot expect a happy financially average life as a scientist, wherever you go. This fact actually almost arises an existential crisis in me, lol. So, I was wondering, is this really true? Maybe someone can tell me it's not that bad and I can try at least some countries? I also heard that USA might be promising in this aspect, I just don't really like the vibe of the States (no offense to the people, living there!). \n\nBy the way, if it's important for my question, my field is Polymer Science, more specifically, polymers in ecology/agriculture, something like this.",

How many if you are also being forced to teach in summer?  I'm in the southeast United States.\n\nBack story, I just had an interview for a lecturer position at a local college.\n\nIt should be noted that I didn't originally apply for the job, the president of the college tracked me down on LinkedIn of all places and asked me to apply.  I have a clinical practice as well as an industry consulting practice, but I know several people who also have a clinical practice and an industry consulting practice who also teach so I figured if the college was so interested I would apply.\n\nI interviewed, which went well, and I asked them about the course load they were trying to fill.\n\n7/7/6 so 7 in Fall, 7 in Spring, 6 in Summer.  Maximum of 5 different courses.  40 hours a week are physically required to be on campus (21 of which would logically be lecturing).  All this was mandatory.\n\nNow I've never heard of this being so high.  My undergraduate college's load was a 2/1 even the 2 year I attended was a 2/1.  My first graduate program was a 2/2 and my other graduate program was a 3/3.  Last time I taught it was a 2/2.\n\nWhen I left the interview, I called my former advisor and asked him to guess the teaching load.  He was not close (He guessed no higher than a 5/5, which is typical community college around here).  He was amazed that not only that, but that it was mandated Summer as well.  \n\nSo I ask you all, what are your teaching loads because a 7/7/6 doesn't even seem humanely possible though this could explain why the three (of four) faculty members in the department I met looked completely dead inside.",

Internship has taught me that full time clinical work is not for me (major respect to those who can do full time clinical work and avoid burnout)! I have always envisioned myself pursuing an academic career after graduation, but recently I have been feeling disillusioned with academia. The stress of pursuing funding to stay afloat, pressure to publish, and endless work hours for a modest salary have me wondering if an academic career aligns with my long-term life goals. I've started looking at industry positions and am wondering if anyone in r/AskAcademic has tips for selling clinical psych/research skills in an industry setting. I love the process of research and data analysis and I have a very strong quant background in structural equation modeling, longitudinal data analysis, and multilevel modeling but not much experience in machine learning/data mining. It seems like many of the UX research/data science positions I have seen ask for machine learning skills. Are there industry positions where SEM/multilevel modeling skills are desired? Any tips for selling my quant background without machine learning skills?\n\nI also have an unrelated, but more practical question about applying to industry positions. What is the timeline that companies are typically looking to fill positions? I won't finish my PhD until this summer (at the end of internship) and have applied to a couple of postdoc positions with an August start date. My assumption is that the timeline to fill industry positions is a bit shorter.",

However, the deadline for MSc applications are at the end of the month due to interview process (There are interview for MSc programmes in Europe).

We first met in my hometown, dated in person for 1 year, and LDR for 4 years. We have been in a 5-year relationship with a few breakups in between.\n\nThis all started when he got notified that he was offered a post-doc position (2024-2026) in Europe. I asked him if he would be willing to only apply to English-speaking post-docs for his third post-doc, but my suggestion was rejected. He said that if there are no English-speaking post-docs available, he would be jobless, and missing a year of work in academia is alike death. his answer was no.\n\nMy partner (M28) just started his first post-doc position, and post-doc opportunities in his field are very few and competitive. He lives in a country where English is not the primary language. I'm (F27) an English speaker, and I've brought it up to him that us settling down in an English-speaking city is very important to my social relations and also my career. He understands this and has always been very adamant about finding an English-speaking post-doc. And always reassuring me that he's doing his best to apply to those positions. \n\nBut unfortunately underneath all the optimism and hopefulness, I found out last night as I'm visiting him abroad that he will leave me to pursue a non-English post-doc if that was his only option. I asked if he would consider moving to my hometown or a third city to pursue research in the private section or industry, and he was very against that saying that he spent over 10 years on his education. And that being a researcher is the only thing he's good at. \n\nI felt so blind-sighted by his response because I thought we shared the same goal (settling down in an English-speaking city). This was the purpose of my trip - to see if we were compatible living in the same space. I asked him what did he think was going to happen - he told me he hoped I would change my mind about living in a foreign city after staying with him. Even though we have not set an end date for our LDR. I felt very betrayed and dumb and led on... \n\nI love him very much, but I feel like the wool has been pulled over me. How do I even go about this?\n\nTL;DR: my partner (M28) knows I want to settle down in an English-speaking city, and has continuously been very adamant and understanding. But I (F27) just found out he would leave me if a foreign post-doc was his only option. Advice appreciated!",

I am sick of moving countries (I used to live in 5 countries already), and I have my partner in my current residence. However, remote postdoc positions seem to be rare.\n\nMy partner is currently pursuing a PhD (yay, another academic!), and it takes at least an additional 1.5 years to graduate. Are there any smart approaches to convince universities/professors/research committees to work remotely in my case until my partner graduates too? Does it make sense to argue along the lines of \"I do not want to move country again because of my partner\"? Or are there any other approaches to argue for a remote postdoc position? \n\nI must admit that more than 50% of my PhD was remote due to COVID. Although it was sometimes isolating for me, I published some papers, and the research process was relatively smooth (computer science). This means I am quite confident that I can continue conducting high-quality research while being fully remote. Fully remote is definitely not ideal (for the work), but it makes me much more comfortable as I can be with those closest to me while continuing the academic research path.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would love to hear your thoughts! What would be your approach? How would you tackle the problem of an interesting postdoc position but not being willing to move because of your partner? Due to my personal interest, I am currently stuck and would love to hear some opinions/experiences.\n\nBest,\n\n/megamaracuja",

I can't know for certain if I am **passionate** about my subject but I am definitely interested in it, in fact I've seen countless PhD offers but took this one after months because it caught my eye. I also have experience with half the tools but not with the other half, so in some sense I feel half familiar half unfamiliar with my thesis.\n\nI like research, have done two research internships and one clinical (psychology) even though I could've chosen to do all 3 clinical.

So, maybe typing this out will help me, but I would like some feedback. I layout the pros and cons of each.\n\n* Harvard:\n   * Good: **1)** they follow the path integral approach to qft and will continue in their qft 2 course (I was given access to their qft 1 course to learn the material before taking their qft 2 course in case their's is slightly different then the one I have already taken. **2)** They cover a lot of material and by the end of qft 2 we should be up to Yang-Mills. **3)** I would be taking a course at a place where there is a lot of academic opportunity and get to meet new people.  \n   * Bad: **1)** I would be slightly behind their level of education when it comes to qft 1 material since we focused mainly on canonical approach and S-matrix calculations, which naturally leads me to be worried about doing poorly and having it affect my GPA (unless that part wouldn't matter since just learning the material would be beneficial). **2)** Logistically it is complicated with my schedule since there are a few TA meetings that overlap but I (appears this way) have been given permission to make them up. \n   * Neutral: Their coursework next semester looks geared more towards string theory and understanding the theory and not so much understanding the physics or calculations behind it.\n* Boston University:\n   * Good: **1)** They follow the same manner as I did in my qft 1 course at my home institution (Tufts) so I wouldn't be behind on anything. **2)** They focus more on the particle physics side of calculations and how it is useful to calculate real events. **3)** There isn't as much of a schedule overlap as with the course from Harvard (overlaps with one item, not two).\n   * Bad: **1)** BU is quite far out from Tufts so the travel is about an hour by subway twice a week.\n   * Neutral: I may become more computationally 'fluid' at BU, but at Harvard I feel my theoretical foundations for QFT would be stronger.\n\nTo help understand which may be more beneficial for me, I would say that I am more of a cosmology person then string person, so more *string inspired* models pop-up in cosmology then pure string theory, but at the same time knowing how to do advance calculations, like with the path integral taught at Harvard would be beneficial in that sense. *But,* BU may be able to teach me more about calculations like Weinberg-Salam models and explicit calculations with those (which are quite beneficial for cosmology). \n\nI would absolutely enjoy hearing everyone's thoughts on this, which one to take, or maybe what I should be questioning myself in order to understand which course to take.",

That's not to say I have no skills or ideas there at all -- obviously I got through a PhD -- but that part has always been much more of a struggle for me. And when I talk to more senior people, it seems like they just found their projects by luck or intuition. Or at least they can't seem to articulate what steps I should be taking to find a project other than \"just keep trying, and think about it more.\"\n\nI understand that part of the process will be patience, but I also want to improve my skills here if I can. So I'm wondering, do you know of any books, papers, or other resources that talk about this problem more generally? Say I'm stepping into a relatively new field and I want to start doing good research: what all should I be thinking about, and is there a systematic approach I should be taking?\n\nI'm in physics/engineering, by the way, although I assume there would be a lot of overlap in other fields.",

        "text": "Hello, I just finished up my first semester of grad school. I inherited my project from a post-doc who left and was originally meant for a phD student. The project was running a year behind schedule when I began working on it. I feel behind and as if I'm a fish out of water trying to figure out what I should be doing, how to do it, when to do it, etc.  \n\nAdditionally, I am/always have been a disaster with project management, organization, and understanding general social norms. I was recently (after beginning grad school) diagnosed with numerous mental health problems, with ADHD and anxiety being the most difficult to manage. \n\nOn top of this, I'm a 1st generation college student, and the academic world is very confusing for me. I am not sure how I should behave or what my role is. I constantly wonder if I should be making decisions regarding my project if my advisor should be consulted each time, and whether or not I have any power to make the decision without her help in order to hurry things along. \n\nI am unsure how much power I have over utilizing the undergrad workers to help with my project. Generally, I am a control freak/perfectionist and worry that if they do tasks (even something as straightforward as weighing things) that it will sabotage my project. But at some point, I need to let them help, and unfortunately, they do not have a set schedule, so my advisor or I have to reach out to them just for them to show up. Most of them show up to the lab when there's no one around to collect hours but are uninterested in doing tasks that they were assigned previously. I'm unsure if I have any say-so in telling them what my expectations of them are. Do I leave this to my advisor to handle? I tend to over-share and speak impulsively, so I attempt to avoid saying anything at all to my advisor to prevent any additional problems. \n\nMy passion for the field and motivation to do anything even reading literature (which I used to love and do for fun) has disappeared entirely after starting medications for my mental illnesses. I am registered with the disability office, and they provide accommodations for classes, but classes have never been a problem for me. If anything I would love to take classes forever, and leave the thesis project behind. I love to do work in the lab, the hands-on stuff, but sitting down to write up anything or read has been very difficult for me lately. Additionally, most of the material makes zero sense to me and I end up going down a rabbithole of unnecessary remedial material that a freshman in the field should have learned due to my terrible memory. My limited working memory makes it difficult to discuss anything with peers that seems halfway intelligent unless I have powerpoint cues or a paper in front of me. \n\nI just don't know if I belong here, or if I need to sit with my advisor and talk about it, or if things will get better? I am having a hard time feeling as if i'm accomplishing nothing and allowing the project to get further behind on progress.",

Directly after undergrad I pursued a terminal masters in occupational health at a smaller, less prestigious university in a third state. In completing this degree, I mostly learned that I wasn't interested in working in occupational health. I went on to work for 4 years as a laboratory technician at a large private institution and now am a 3rd year PhD candidate. My question for the sub is: will this irrelevant masters degree from a less prestigious university ultimately hurt my job prospects post Phd? And, if so, would it be OK to leave it off my CV (given that it will be nearly 10 years old by the time I'm done with my PhD and isn't relevant to my field of study?). Or is it dishonest to leave it out?\n\nThanks for your help, any advice appreciated.\n\nNote: I posted this to [r/AskProfessors](https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/) as well so apologies to anyone seeing it twice.

This is mainly for personal reasons/preferences. They are a very good student and I'm sure will do well in college academically. My concern is the state of affairs in HE across that state; in particular political interference in curriculum. I'm seeing this happen in publics, but also in grants being given to some private SLACs that seem to be about advancing political agendas. \n\nI'm NOT trying to provoke a political argument, but I am trying to figure out how to get insight from those actually working at these schools about how much this is likely to trickle down to the life of an undergraduate over the next four years. It's hard for me to tell from the outside how much of this is a lot of posturing and how much is truly alarming. \n\nI don't mean to downplay how alarming and exhausting this must be for people working at these institutions. I fully admit that this is a selfish inquiry b/c I'm really focussed on making sure my kiddo will be okay for the next four years and will be able to have a positive college experience. I've seen all kinds of bonkers stuff in my career that, while it was terrible for those of us on the front-lines, didn't necessarily trickle down to my students in ways that were very negative. \n\nFinally, as the parent of a queer kid, my number-one priority is their physical and mental health, well-being, and safety. So, I'm trying to get a clear sense about which schools might be truly unsafe for them. \n\nThe schools that are currently on their list (some accepted, some still waiting): UF, FSU, USF, UNF, FSC, Flagler, NOVA\n\nI'm not expecting anyone to respond in ways that reveal their own affiliations/alliances, but if anyone has  advice about how to get insight into these matters, I would appreciate it -- I'd also welcome private messages, but totally understand that you don't know me and may not want to do that. \n\n(Final note: My kiddo has applied to a few places in other states, but they are more of reaches, and, honestly, I think they will end up in Florida b/c they are determined to be there. And, while they are queer, they very much consider themselves apolitical and don't want to talk about the implications of these issues at great length. They think I'm making a lot of fuss over nothing.)",

I just want some input from someone more experienced because I have zero research experience but really wanna learn the conventions of research and get published.\n\nThanks!",

        "text": "Hi, similar posts like this may have already been asked many times but I would like to ask, how would I deal with a teacher who dislikes me?\n\n**Background Information:** I'm a high-schooler, and I eat lunch with my friends beside this teacher who we'll call Ms. A's, classroom. Sometimes, we get a bit too loud and talk about \"inappropriate\"  topics and the Ms. A ends up hearing. She has confronted us on multiple occasions, telling us to tone it down. She has been polite about it, but I can tell she is frustrated and tired of us. Today, my friends and I got into an argument and were exceptionally loud, and this time, when she confronted us, she mentioned something about semester 2. (I couldn't hear what she said) My friends and I are going to be having her as our teacher next semester and we are all anxious because she is going to recognize us.\n\nTherefore, I have come to reddit for your opinion on this situation. Should we move eating places? Should we just listen and pay more attention in her class? This is a tough situation I am in right now hence I wanted to hear from your perspectives.\n\n*Note: We have tried keeping our voices down, but sometimes, abrupt things can happen*",

This happened after I walked in a minute late and sat next to where she was standing. I was expecting her to say something to me so I was kinda staring at her already and then she looked over and said \"hey baby\" in a mom sort of way. I remember kinda smiling at it and holding the eye contact. I think I kept staring at her throughout class looking for the same thing. Can someone explain why this made me happy?",

I have only 3 month. My teammate is in Maths for Finance, it is not a criterion but if the subject has an application with\n\nFinances, it is good.",

I haven't had any luck applying to BME jobs but to be honest, I've only really been spamming the easy apply jobs on linked in. It would be nice to know if there are any jobs that could use a BME/Math dual BS but I haven't been able to think of any. For those wondering why I have both to begin with, I was a math tutor at my school and just slowly kept taking math classes along with my BME major until I got to the point where an extra semester would get me the additional degree.\n\nSome days I can see myself going the math masters direction, some days the biomedical route. Some days I tell myself I'll do both. I guess I'm looking for different options as far as which could be the cheapest to pursue/most profitable for my future. It's been really difficult pinpointing what I want for my future, so any suggestions are more than welcome.",
