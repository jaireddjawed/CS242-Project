She told me that I fucked up and tht she didn’t want me talking to her or her friends. I tried to understand what I did wrong and my friend told me that I harassed them. I thought about it for months and I went to apologize. After that she told me I was unforgivable and that I touched them and lied. I didn’t remember any of that so I asked her about it. She said that I touched them and J lied to them. (I made myself too comfortable around them and I lied to fit in because I tought that if I lied i aould fit in i guess). Now that she told me that I remember. Not exactly all of it but i recon that i did it because I kind of remember it. I know it’s unforgiving but it makes me sick because I thought that I was respectable and I did that last year. This year I am trying to make a change and I’m trying to make my female friends as more comfortable as possible.\nI am trying to change.",

I had been at my college and went to my first class with no issues. I only have one class on M/W so I decided to go and get Starbucks on campus with two of my friends. I get my venti and drank it as we talked and studied. At this point it had been about 3 hours since I had last used the bathroom and was like wow I need to go NOW. I asked my friends to come with me but they both said no. I get nervous if I don’t have another girl with me so I decided to just wait. Well another 10 minutes have gone by and I’m super desperate and tell them again. They said they wanted to head back to the dorms and I could just use the bathroom there. Well we walked and about halfway to the dorms I can’t hold it. I just stood there in the middle of campus having a total accident and trying not to have a meltdown. My dress and leggings getting very wet :,( My friends were like “No way, you really had to go! We thought you could at least hold it til we got there.” A couple other students saw but no one really said anything. I then made the walk of shame back to the dorm and changed. I’m just ashamed and embarrassed and honestly just upset.",

Often, I would tie sewing string to locusts in an attempt to see how strong they where and what they could carry, those that were strong flew away and earned their freedom, and those that were not… well, I would “operate” on.\n\nI would typically pull legs off with tweezers, cut bodies in half with scalpels and join a mass assembly of body parts together with a hot glue gun. This fascinated me as at the time I believed I could somehow scientifically birth a new creature sculpted by my own hands.\n\nEventually my interest grew stronger and I recall asking my mother for a hypodermic needle set for Christmas, in of course, an attempt to seemingly transfer blood from one creature to another. Obviously my mother instantly shot down my request and threw my entire collection out as she decided it was enough. The tank stunk and we had multiple bug infestations as a result of my carelessness in securing my specimens. \n\nI can’t help but wonder, where my interest in this subject would have brought me.",

I was around 7 or 8 at the time and my mom was about to pick me up. Being the dumb kid I was, I didn't know how much of value money was. Meaning I didn't know if 20 bucks was alot of money or not. Anyways, I was sitting on the couch in the living room of my grandma's house watching PBS kids. My grandma went to the kitchen to make herself some breakfast and I got bored. Her purse was on the couch next to me so I decided to take a peek. In her purse she had the usual old people stuff, candy, coupons, meds, etc. Then I saw her wallet. My mom had told me the day before that when she picked me up we would go to target. I didn't have any money so I decided to \"borrow\" some from my grandma to buy a toy or something. I didn't know how much to take so I took 50 bucks thinking it was the equivalent to 10 dollars. I was wearing a jacket so I shoved the bill into my jacket's pocket. I then put her wallet back and pretended like nothing happened. After my mom picked me up, I just so happened to find 50 dollars in my pocket. Yea because money just comes out of thin air apparently. My mom didn't think anything of it but my grandma's never looked at me the same way since. I never confessed but I think she knows I took it.",
