        "text": "TL;DR: I swear a lot in this post, it was just something extremely random that happened at work because I decided to sing in french and gave my coworker the raunchy translations to the song.\n\nSo, I was working today and felt like singing, but instead of singing in English like usual, I figured I would sing a few songs I learned from my family out east. My coworker was standing behind me and could hear me singing, I will call him W, and seemed pretty interested in it, this was the exchange we had:\n\n&gt;Me: -singing- Estit d'criss de tabarnac, estit d'criss de diable\n\n&gt;W: That sounds pretty cool, what's it mean?\n\n&gt;Me: Roughly translates to god-damn fucking son of a bitch, god damn fucking son.\n\n&gt;W: Oh...\n\nAbout ten minutes pass from there when I transitioned into another song, which lasts about five minutes and is meant to sound like a love song. He was quietly laughing under his breath because he knows I dislike love songs and asked me:\n\n&gt;W: Alright, what does all that mean?\n\n&gt;Me: it roughly translates to \"you are ugly as hell, but I still sorta like you\"\n\nAt this point, he just shook his head and laughed a bit. I didn't launch into another song till near the end of my shift because I knew if anyone heard me and understood, I'd be up shit creek without a paddle. I sung the two minute tune and was almost immediately asked for the translation, so here is what I told him:\n\n&gt;Me: It roughly translates to \"She says sure, she says well, she says show me the size, show me the size of your puny ass dick, I say run before I fuck you with my giant ass dick, I don't want her no more so I fucked her in the ass\"\n\nSo now he wants me to sing every day when I'm at work, and I'm alright with that.",

        "text": "I have done this for 7 years now, teaching that is... I love my job, but sometimes I have quite interesting experiences with my students. Here are a few.\n\nStudent repeatedly calls in sick, doesn't show up for class, when he is here he doesn't participate. He doesn't show up for class for a week after his midterm exam. I tried calling his contact number, haven't gotten an answer. The day after we remove him from the class, he shows up. He was a little upset he kicked him out.\n\nHad a few students who had learning disabilities, even though they denied it when it was brought up. Their homework grades were always terrible, along with exams and quizzes. I'm talking like 30s and 40s on a good day. It really hurt me to see them discouraged when they found out grades for exams. But they always tried, put forth an effort. At the end of the semester, I would go in and raise their exam and quiz grades to make sure they passed the class. Granted it was passing by the skin of their teeth, but passing nonetheless. If a student doesn't try, or no effort is put forth, I will not help them out at all. I have never and will never take points away though!\n\nHad hopes for several students that came from bad backgrounds, hopes that they would turn their lives around. Some were drugs, some were jail, etc. Out of 20 or so students that I hoped would turn their lives around, I have had maybe 5 that succeeded. It gives me a ton of pride knowing that I had a hand in helping at least these few perform a life-180.\n\n",

        "text": "First time posting here, I work for an electrical contractor for commercial and industrial sites.\n\nBack story, I do a bit of bidding and project managing/coordinating whatever you want to call it. I have this really terrible project that, when still in the bidding phase, I did not want to touch. My boss (the owner of the company) thought we might need it during the time frame it was slotted to start in order to keep our guys busy. Knocked a GOOD chunk off the price to get the contract. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe architect has been requesting a whole bunch of add-ons to work we're doing. So we provide the general contractor, who is the middle-man in all of this, with pricing for each additional item. Never hear back; never receive any approval. I probably sent reminders to the GC over 10 times that these items are still pending.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWell now we're in the last week of being and site, they haven't approved diddly squat. The architect is getting mad at us because the additional work hasn't been done. We try to get the ball rolling on some of the items they're really adamant about, but my boss of course, like any sane person, wants it in writing they understand they are going to have to pay XYZ. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nToday I get the call from the head honcho over at the GC, pretty much to yell at me. She's GC for general contractor and I'm me:\n\n&gt; **GC:** I was out of town, but I'm looking over the pricing you re-sent to the office and this is just ridiculous. \n\n&gt; **Me:** Okay, what can I go over with you to help?\n\n&gt; **GC:** I don't see why X is going to take so long to do. *scoffs* There's no reason for it to cost that much, I'm not forwarding that to architect for approval.\n\n&gt; **Me:** I completely understand. We were weary of where our price came out at too. I clarified with our tech in the field several times and he is standing his ground that we need X amount of hours.\n\n&gt; **Me:** Per him he has to coordinate with X contractor and help them, etc. *Explains process of work and that this change was requested after everything had already been done. The walls and ceiling would need to be taken down and the space was a lot tighter to work in with everything installed.* \n\n&gt; **GC:** WHATEVER. THAT ASIDE, THESE OTHER ITEMS NEED TO GET STARTED NOW. \n\n&gt; **GC:** I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU JUST DIDN'T DO THEM ALREADY. \n\n&gt; **GC:** I'll send over approval or whatever you wanted, but my question to you is WHAT DO YOU CARE WHO PAYS YOU?!!\n\n&gt; **Me:** I'm sorry?\n\n&gt; **GC:** *still yelling* Whether I'm paying you or X contractor pays you or whatever, what does it matter to you?!! You're going to get paid! \n\n&gt; **Me:** I'm sorry, I can't advise on that. I just know per *Owner's Name*, he wants it in writing.\n\n&gt; **GC:** THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS! Given our past relationship we shouldn't need to put it in writing you should just do the work!\n\n&gt; **Me:** Again I'm sorry, I can't really speak to that. That is something you would need to talk with *Owner's Name* about, I do not control that. Personally, I believe it's just to protect all of us especially since there have been so many issues with this job.\n\n&gt; **GC:** FINE. I guess I'll send that over because YOU want to make such a big deal over it. I don't get it though, this is nothing, *random past job that I had nothing to do with* was a complicated job. This isn't complicated, but you're making it that. You're holding up the job!!\n\n&gt; **Me:** Would you like to speaker with the owner?\n \n&gt; **GC:** NO, I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THAT. JUST GET IT DONE. *Hangs up*\n\ntl;dr General contractor yells at me because she doesn't understand why we don't just do thousands of dollars in work without any approval. We should just be cool, but she's still going to argue with me over pricing and us holding up the job when they don't respond for over a month.",

        "text": "First time posting here, and on mobile to boot. Apologies in advance for spelling errors, grammatical errors, and the like. Oh, and for the length. \n\nI work, or should I say worked, for a fairly big traffic control company here in BC, Canada, as what could be best described as the assistant warehouse/fleet manager. Or the manager's assistant. It was never really made clear in the four months I held this position. My tasks were to deliver/pick up equipment at jobsites, pick up new equipment, fully arm the fleet of lane closure trucks with the proper gear, pick up new trucks, dropped off old ones, clean the warehouse, answer all calls and emails when the manager was away, program and deliver CMS boards (those orange LED message boards you see at/near construction sites), and in case of emergency, sent out as a temporary traffic control person/flagger.  Aside from these duties, I was sent on a number of tasks outside of my job description, from delivering checks to the city engineering department, to picking up coworkers lunches, to building ikea beds, and refueling the owner's personal work truck. \n\nLast week, I received a call from one of our lane closure technician (LCT), who had a problem with her truck:\n\nLCT - \"my truck shakes when I go to turn it on. I've tried to call (my boss' name) and tried texting her, but she's not answering! What should I do? Can you get a hold of her for me?\"\n\nNoxPrime - I'm not too sure what to do in this situation. But I can try and get ahold of her for you. Let me know if you need anything else. \n\nI hung up, and texted my boss. I didn't hear anything back from her for the rest of the night, so I'm thinking \"cool, problem solved.\"\n\nThe next day, I get into work, and my boss asks me why I told the LCT that I couldn't help her. What? I told my boss what had happened, and she understood, but the owner was pissed. \n\nBoss - *owners name* wanted me to fire you. I told him no, because you're needed here, and and you've never done anything wrong. I called the LCT when I got out of a meeting, and she told me not to worry, the owner was helping me. So I texted him, and he said \"anything for you! :)\". This morning, I get in, and he's floating 10 feet off the ground pissed.\"\n\nWow. I'm a Deadman over not knowing what to do in a situation I've never dealt with before. My boss tells me if that ever happens again, I'm to pick up one of our spare trucks, and drive it out to the lct, even at the risk of stranding myself wherever that location may be. Ok, now I know. \n\nI head upstairs to the owner's office. I get up there and he immediately calls me and the GM into his office. \n\nNoxPrime - I just wanted to come up here to apologize for the misunderstanding. I now know what the procedure is in that type of situation, and it won't happen again. \n\nThis is where he starts to verbally rip a strip out of me. Talking about how much of an inconvenience it was for him to drive out to pick her up, and set her up with a new truck. How I told her I can't help her and how he pays me well to know what the fuck to do when it comes to my job.  I again apologize and guarantee it won't happen again.  Everything seems to be OK. I go and air my grievences with HR. She comforts me by saying I can't get fired like that. That there's a long process since I'm part of management. There'd be several HR meetings first, followed by write-ups.  That was two Mondays ago. \n\nFast forward to this week. On tuesday, I was asked to assist in building two ikea beds for our dispatch workers that were required to stay overnight. Assisting meant building them by myself. So I started. I got one half done before having to drive signs out to a location that took 1.5 hours Roundtrip. I get back, and complete the rest of it, with only a couple short vape breaks throughout the process, which took short of 4 hours  to complete. Wednesday, I awoke throughout the night vomiting, as I had caught the flu my daughter so graciously brought home from school. My boss agreed with me not spreading it at work. Hours later, she texts me saying I have a meeting with HR the next  morning\n\nThursday morning. 9am. I get in, and the receptionist says that the owner wants to talk to me. Fuck. I go upstairs again, and he calls me and the GM in again. He's pissed, and I could see his face turning red behind the spraytan.\n\nOwner - have a seat. I've decided to let you go. How the fuck do you tell an lct that you won't help her. I went to bed last night pissed off at you! I pay you to do a task, and you have your boss do your job? (Boss's name) came in early yesterday to put that bed together you didn't bother to come in to do. \n\nNoxprime - I thought we resolved the lct issue last week, and you're harping on Mr a week later about....\n\nOwner - harping? Really? You're going to say that to me?!\n\nNoxprime - harping, bitching, well seeing as how you're \"letting me gooo\", what do I have to lose, really? \n\n\nCue the yelling back and forth between owner and myself. \n\n\nOwner - (pauses for a minute) do you like your job? *yes. Up until this moment, I loved it*  I'm giving you another chance. You have kids, I have kids. One more fuck up and you're gone. Now get the fuck out of my office and do your job. \n\n\nI head out, and off to help a flagger with a message board. On the way I have an emotional breakdown. I call my fiancé and fill her in on what happened. I tell her I'm done with the company. She agrees. I call my mother, and after explaining what happened, I secure some emergency funds to help me until I secure a new job so I don't have to dip into my savings. I get back to the office,  inform my friendly coworkers of my decision before meeting with the gm and hr. I tell them that I feel I'm being bullied lately, and I won't be having they. I'm using my last chance to take the high road for myself, and quit. Cue the violin music and the tears from a couple people. \n\nIt's Friday. I picked up my last cheque today, and I haven't felt this happy in quite a while. \n\n\nTl;dr: fired. Yelled at boss, given second chance. Quit. Booyakasha.",

Since I only have to run on road across this small bridge of around 75 feet across (over a \"river\" that is about 10 feet wide this time of year), I decided to keep the 12 row corn head on.  I'm only going to be on the road for the length of the bridge and then I'm back in the field.\n\n  Yeah, you out there already laughing can see what is going to happen.

I put it in gear and inched forward.  It got the hint.  I got into the field and got working.  Two loops later, I see a Sheriff's squad with the lights on and a deputy leaning against it.  It called the cops on me.  Said I chased him *Oh! It was MALE?!*.  Muddy field saved my bacon- my tire tracks were still on the bridge.  Deputy heard my side, saw the tracks.  He waggled his finger at me.  \"Don't do it again.  Have a nice day.\"\n\nTL:DR Sub-compact hatchback tells combine to back up and let him through.",

She was warning all the new hires not to get attached to me or to depend on me too much. I am definitely coming back to work after I have my baby, if for no other reason than to constantly undermine her attempts for authority with my very presence, as I'm apparently currently doing.\n\n---------------------------------\n\nAnother coworker came back from maternity leave a few months ago, and when she did she approached me to ask if This Bitch has said anything about my weight. Apparently, when this other coworker was nine months pregnant, This Bitch told her that her face was looking \"puffy\" and that \"it might be time to start watching what you eat.\"\n\n---------------------------------\n\nShe also told a manager (not our manager, but a manager) that he had gained weight since getting married, to his face, completely unprompted. He wasn't even engaging with her at the time, he was just passing by her cube and she felt the need to inform him of this. \n\n-----------------------------------\n\nShe once, also completely unprompted, asked a coworker if she was pregnant. The coworker was not pregnant, and was very confused. This Bitch explained that she had had a premonition that the coworker was pregnant, that her premonitions always come true, and that the coworker should practice safe sex.\n\nNot only did the coworker not become pregnant, but when I *did* get pregnant several months later, she failed to psychically detect the fetus and had to be told I was, like everyone else. \n\n----------------------------------\n\nShe has decided that she hates one of the new hires, and she told him that, had he been assigned to sit next to her, he would've had to move. He wasn't assigned to sit next to her, but she wanted him to know anyway, that if he *had* been, he would've had to move.\n\n----------------------------------\n\nLately, ever since her decision that she's going to be a supervisor, she's been treating interactions between myself and her as though they are supervisor-subordinate interactions, not coworker-coworker interactions. For example, today I asked her a clarifying question about a task we were both doing, and she responded by saying that she \"didn't have time to keep track of me.\" Then we both returned to doing the exact same activity at the same level of urgency. \n\n----------------------------------\n\nShe's also started trying to intercept people who come to me to ask questions so that she can answer their questions instead. I guess because she's the \"senior\" agent or because I'm pregnant or something.\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nSpeaking of, she's also *really, really* invested in catching me having pregnancy brain. So much so that she's inserting herself into my conversations with other people to blame things on my pregnancy, in the same way someone might blame things on a woman being on her period. I can no longer be tired, uncertain, irritated, hungry, or need to take a #2 without it being evidence of how pregnancy is crippling me. ",

        "text": "I work as the dockmaster for a privately-owned marina. This first post isn't a specific tale, but rather, a quick overview of how docking works, followed by all the excuses people use to try to get out of paying. If there's interest, I can post some actual tales.\n\nCity bylaw states that all docking must be paid; refusal to pay constitutes trespassing and offending boats may be towed at the owner's expense. Boats pay for docking based on the length of the boat. There's a fee for a short stay, and a higher fee for overnight. The fee is for docking only - all services (power, water, washrooms, showers) are provided free of charge and operated not by the marina, but by the city parks department. The docking wall itself is considered marina property, leased from the city. Everything else is city park. Marina members who pay a seasonal rate at the main marina can stay on the wall for free, as long as they let the office know how long they'll be staying (so the marina can rent out the vacant docks).\n\nSo here are some of the excuses I've heard:\n\n&gt; The power at this location isn't working / the showers are closed / I don't have convenient access to a water hookup. I'm not paying / I should get a discount.\n\nSorry, but the fee is for docking only. Other services are offered free of charge as a courtesy. It's a very busy area and there are plenty of people who will be happy to pay the full rate regardless of the status of the services. You'll either have to pay or leave.\n\n&gt; The weather is too rough / my engine is damaged. I'm stuck, I couldn't leave even if I wanted to, I shouldn't have to pay.\n\nI'm sorry, that's a shame. But space is at a premium. There are plenty of safe, calm, sheltered areas for you to anchor for free, and the area is sheltered enough that there is no danger in moving the boat a short distance. If you want to stay on the wall, you have to pay the docking fee.\n\n&gt; I have no cash.\n\nNo problem, we have a portable debit/credit card machine.\n\n&gt; I forgot my wallet.\n\nSorry, it's city bylaw that all docking must be paid. If you can't or won't pay, I'll have to ask you to leave.\n\n&gt; I have a deal with the manager. \n\nThen why didn't he tell me about you or your deal when I spoke with him this morning?\n\n&gt; I get the seniors/group/disability discount.\n\nThere are no such discounts. Everyone pays the same rate.\n\n&gt; But I'm not tied to the wall, I'm tied to this other boat because there was no space left on the wall.\n\nSorry, that's known as rafting, and bylaw and regulations state you pay the same rate for rafting. You're free to move anywhere you like at no additional charge if space opens up, but if we provide a discount for rafting, people will do it even when there is open space.\n\n&gt; I work for the city, I don't have to pay.\n\nThat's nice, but you still have to pay. This is a private business.\n\n&gt; I'm friends with the mayor. He told me it was free. I'll talk to him and have you fired!\n\nIf it's even true that you know the mayor in the first place, you can try if you like, but the mayor has exactly zero say in the hiring practices of a private business.\n\n&gt; How do I even know you really work here?\n\nWell, I'm wearing a shirt with a marina staff logo and carrying a clipboard with marina paperwork. If that's not enough, you can look up the phone number for the marina office and you can call and ask them for a physical description of their dockmaster.\n\n&gt; What if I refuse to pay? I bet you can't even do anything. You can't touch me or my boat.\n\nI can call the police and file a trespassing report using the name and registration number clearly displayed on your boat, with this photo I just took with my phone to prove you were here. And I can have your boat towed and stored at your expense until you pay your docking fees.\n\n&gt; I have a dock at Other Nearby Marina.\n\n...good for you? So... OH, you heard marina members get to stay for free. Sorry, wrong marina. Separate businesses, no relation.\n\n&gt; I have a dock at your marina.\n\nGreat, so I'll just call the office and let them know you're over here. What's your dock number? ...what do you mean don't call the office? If you're with the marina I have to let them know you're over here. Oh you're not actually with the marina? Pay up.\n\n&gt; I just arrived this morning at 7am, you can't charge me for last night!\n\nWell. \n\nYour fire pit is full of ashes and hot embers. There's an empty 24 of beer and an empty bottle of vodka. You have a tent and four camp chairs and a barbeque set up. There's a garbage bag full of dinner plates and food leftovers. \n\nIt's currently 8:30am. You set up a campsite, drank 24 beers and a bottle of vodka, barbequed a chicken and steak dinner, had a fire, and roasted marshmallows... in an hour and a half starting at 7am?\n\n&gt; My boat is 25 feet long.\n\nThe cleats (tie points for ropes) are twelve feet apart from each other, and your boat takes up three cleat gaps. Also these gray paint lines on the ground here are placed five feet apart from each other specifically for the purpose of estimating boat length and your boat takes up seven-and-a-half paint spaces. Also the model number clearly printed in bold lettering on the side of the boat says it's 37 feet long. I'm going to charge you for a 37-foot-long boat.\n\n&gt; But you're closed this late in the season, how can you charge me?\n\nAs the dockmaster, currently on-site and on the clock, I can assure you that we are, in fact, open this late in the season.\n\n&gt; It's raining!\n\nWTF do you want me to do about it?!",

        "text": "Been here too long. The medication helps but the craziness doesn't go away. Recently, I was forced to take a medical leave. Was out only three weeks (may be a record for the shortest medical leave at this company). Since then, every time I take a day off another responsibility or access to data is removed from me. Others I have talked to here tell me this is the \"trying to force you out routine\". Love the subtle approach of sneak attack, the nuances of the coward in charge approach to employee intimidation. \n\nWhat to do about it?? That is what puzzles me. Am I medicated enough to stick it out until I find another job? Sure hope so, because I have never been forced out of a job before so this is a whole new experience for me. Guess I will just have to think of it an experiment and try to detach emotionally from this madness.\n\nHere are some of my favorite lines from management.\n\n\"Unfortunately, since you were out for three weeks we won't be giving you a raise this year\" (paltry as it is - even though it is left unsaid) \"and by the way we are cutting your bonus a couple of thousand this year as well\". (In other words all the long hours you put in on the project that sent you out on a medical leave in the first place doesn't count because you we out on a medical leave). Don't you love the subtle employer whack upside the head this kind of one on one interaction provides. Makes me feel like I have made such great career choices - especially the one that lead me to this job. (Was that sarcasm? That sounded like sarcasm.)\n\nAnother one I love is \"If you aren't nicer, no one is going to want to work with you\". Like there is a downside to being sarcastic and annoyed with idiots especially when they are making your job twice a hard as it has to be. My best revenge here is the business partners still want to talk to me, invite me to lunch, invite me events. This makes it obvious that someone is just mad because I was a little too loud and hurt their little feelings.\n\nWhile I feel like the many years I have been here, the hard work and dedication I have given may be more a curse than a blessing at this point as my co-workers begin to treat me as a leper (no one wants to be too close when the hatchet falls) this is one battle I do not intent to loose. I may have to go, but it will be on my terms not yours.\n\nFeels so good just to vent some of the frustration here. Keeps me hanging on.\n\n",

Cuz walking to the bathroom or kitchen to get coffee exerts energy makes her hot. The rest of us are freezing. \n\nI adjust air so it's normal, still cold but not freezing. Coworker is hot and pissed. She decided to confront me. Coworker is CB =crazy bitch. Me is B=Bella. \n\nCB-\"I don't know why you don't wear more clothes to work if you're cold. \" I'm in pants and long sleeves and a sweater. \n\nB-\" I'm wearing warm clothes but it's freezing. \"\n\nCB -\" I just turned that on. I hate working in this department. I love working with supervisor (she's not there on Fridays) but I hate working with you and everyone else.\" \n\nB-ok. I'm sorry but it's really cold in here. It's early and freezing.\"\nI readjust and turn air back on for her because she's special. \n\nCB-\"i hate working with you. You are so bossy and one of those people. \"\nI'm dumbfounded. We work with different clients. It's very separate. I'm thinking wtf?? \n\nB-\" ok sounds like an issue for HR of you are having problems in our department. \"\n\nBasically CB loses her shit. Tells me she loves me but working here is hard. I'm like what the actual fuck?? She's new. We are chill and don't have issues with each other in the 18 months I've worked here. I tell her that it is what it is and maybe just go to HR. \n\nFirst of all, you tell me you love me? Ummm no. You are creepy. Second of all, you pick the day to freak out when our supervisor is off?? How convenient for you. Coworker is passive aggressive and refuses to get the door and answer phones so I get nothing done. BTW, that is her main job. Fml. I'm dreading Monday because I have to deal with this crazy bitch. I'm thinking I might go above my supervisor and straight to my manager. Idk. I don't want to go to HR. That will come down on me and maybe make my life more miserable. CB is miserable and a total fucking bitch. Unfortunately she is a narcissist sist and many ppl love her. She used to be in another department but was kicked out because she fucked up a lot. We are her last straw. She hides her true colors and  only freaked out on me because we were alone.\n\nThanks for letting me vent. \n\nEdit :I actually didn't edit. Sorry for the wrong words etc. I'm mobile so maybe formatting is lame. \n\nThanks for the feedback. I'm trying to chill out about everything!!",

        "text": "[An introduction to my coworker.\n](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/5485jh/stuff_my_coworker_has_done_to_irritate_me/)\n\nFirst off, it turns out one of the guys who we'd thought had called in sick has actually decided to quite his job and is not coming back. This Bitch has been telling people that, now that he's gone, she's going to be a supervisor.\n\n1. He was not a supervisor, so his quitting in no way leaves a vacancy for her to fill.\n\n2. Without him we now have a grand total of three people on our team. One of those people is our boss, and the other- hello there- will be giving birth some time in the next two months and taking maternity leave whenever that decides to happen. Who exactly does she plan to supervise? Herself??\n\n--------------------------\n\nShe works out her finances at her desk every payday. She opens a notebook and divides up her paycheck between various bills, makes grocery lists and meal plans, that kind of thing. Which is fine, except that she spends the whole time acting morally superior to anyone whose life does *not* require extensive and precise bookkeeping in order to make ends meet. She seems to take some kind of pride in the way her family lives paycheck-to-paycheck.\n\nNow that I'm pregnant, she's been making knowing remarks about how I, too, will soon be struggling financially. Coming in with new clothing or a haircut now gets me an admonishment that I won't be able to spend money on myself like this for much longer. \n\n----------------------------\n\nShe makes homophobic and transphobic comments to me, knowing that I'm bisexual, under the assumption that it won't bother me because bisexuality isn't real and one day I'll realize that. I've told her that it *does* bother me, but she does it anyway because, I suppose, I might've realized in the interim that I'm really straight and now it's okay. \n\n---------------------------\n\nShe's voting for Trump. This wouldn't necessarily be a problem, except that she will bring this up in conversations where it's only tangentially relevant, and then, when you try to talk about what he stands for and what problems you might have with him, she says \"I don't want to discuss politics.\"\n\nWe weren't discussing politics a minute ago, but then you had to go and remind me that Trump exists, didn't you?\n\n--------------------------\n\nIf we have anyone important coming to the building we are asked to tidy up our cubicles. This Bitch will go around to the cubicles of people who are on lunch or are off or out for whatever reason, and will \"clean\" for them. The unfortunate person will then have to track her down and ask her to return their [insert random cubicle decoration here] because she'd decided it looked unprofessional. She has a dedicated plastic bin under her desk for putting other people's stuff into so that they won't embarrass the company.\n\nShe does this to me more frequently than anyone else because I sit right beside her. Every time that she does, we have a talk about *why* I have three distinct piles of paper on my desk, and how it is *not okay* for her to combine these into one pile. Doesn't matter. One pile looks tidier. \n\n---------------------------\n\nLast Christmas I was making small Pinterest-style crafts as gifts for my coworkers. I had brought the supplies to work and was making them on my breaks. She moved the supplies for her little craft to the top of the pile to encourage me to finish it first.\n\n--------------------------\n\nSince I have so many food allergies, I don't partake in things like open boxes of donuts or pizza because there's no way for me to know, with 100% certainty, that it's safe for me to eat. This Bitch got used to seeing me refuse food, and then, one day, when management was handing out wrapped ice cream bars *with the ingredients lists printed on the side,* it blew her mind to see me take one. To the extent that she went and got other coworkers and brought them over to point out that I was eating. Then, the next time that I chose not to eat a catered lunch that I could not verify was safe for me to eat, she became distressed that I'd \"reverted\" after my \"breakthrough\" and seemed to decide that I must have an eating disorder. \n\nI tried to give her the analogy that a diabetic person would also be unable to eat certain things for medical reasons, and that my allergies were no different, and she responded with, \"But you're not diabetic, sweetie.\" \n\nFor the next few months, whenever she saw me eating a lollipop while I worked or any other food that I'd brought from home, she would repeat the summoning of the coworkers, only now with more over-the-top and exaggerated praise, like I was a dog she was trying to train to eat.\n\n------------------------\n\nIn the beginning of my pregnancy I was very hungry, and she attempted to feed me. But she made this attempt by waiting until I'd left my desk, and then putting food on it with a little sticky note reading \"For my hungry pregnant woman :)\"\n\nNaturally, from the tone of the note I assumed this had been left for me by my husband, and I was a little confused why he'd brought me something which I didn't like, and why he'd been at my work in the first place. So I threw the food away. She was so upset that her completely anonymous and unsolicited gift had been rejected that she refused to speak to me for three days.",

        "text": "Background:\n\n* Literally everyone but the company owner and one nepotism hire hated the General Manager (GM)\n* We had a few tens of thousands of greeting cards from a closed Hallmark store that were not selling very quickly\n* One of these non-sellers was a card that, when opened, played the Hamster Dance song.  No. Google it yourself if you don't know it. Fuck that song.\n* When this card was found, several employees thought it was good great fun to play the Hamster Dance song at every possible opportunity for several days in a row\n* GM made the mistake of becoming more and more visibly agitated by the sound of the Hamster Dance song.\n* Steve was the king of pranksters.\n\n&amp;nbsp; Sooo one day we decided it was time to get under GM's skin. Nearly everybody with a computer put the Hamster Dance on standby.  Several people without computers made sure to have musical greeting cards handy.  It started slow, with a couple of random people playing the song when GM was near.  He didn't like it.  When he came around, anyone who was in on the gag would start the song. More and more people played it more and more often, to the point that everywhere he went he was constantly bombarded by the Hamster Dance song.  At one point, it was playing from three computers at once, just for him.  This lasted for a couple of glorious hours, until he finally got super-pissed and officially declared \"No more fucking Hamster Dance. I mean it.\"  \n\n&amp;nbsp; So the day went on in relative silence.  GM would sometimes drive a little electric wheelbarrow thing around the warehouse (referred to as 'the clown car') and near the end of the day, he drove through the room where I work with a half dozen other people, including Steve.  Steve heard the clown car's motor as it came through the door and he fired up the Hamster Dance song at full volume.  GM came flying through at top speed on his way to wherever he was headed and didn't even slow down as he passed Steve's desk - he just said \"You're fired, Steve.\" and kept rolling.  \n\n***\n\nBut the story has a happy ending!  Steve wasn't *actually* fired, he was only joking-i-hate-you-right-now fired. And the GM finally made enough of a mess of the company that the owner hated him too and the GM \"voluntarily resigned\" from the company. ",

        "text": "So last week was my birthday (September 23rd).  Yesterday after talking with our administrative assistant about my schedule for this week (it's September 27th when she told me this) she asks me to sit down because she has a confession to make. \n\nShe tells me that she and our associate director (AD) opened a package last week (on my birthday) that had a cookie in it and they split it and ate it. \n\nShe said that they thought that it was a free sample (we never get free samples of anything sent to our office, it's not that kind of business, and we are STRONGLY discouraged from accepting any types of gifts from clients). After eating it, she told me, they remembered that they didn't look at who it was addressed to and they saw that it was addressed to me. \n\nSo instead of telling me that day when it happened (I was there all day and nobody said anything) they threw the packaging (that also contained a letter) in the trash. After she told me, I immediately fished through the garbage and found the package and learned that it was a \"surprise\" present from my wife and my name was as big as day on the front of the bag AND it clearly says \"A gift for you from [insert my wife's name]\". \n\nI confirmed with my wife that she did indeed send it. She said that she didn't tell me about it because it was supposed to be a surprise, but thought that it hadn't been delivered yet. \n\nNobody has apologized for what they did and furthermore, when I brought it up to our administrative assistant, you could tell she was clearly embarrassed, but said, \"Tell your wife I said thanks\"\n\nShould I laugh it off as a mistake? Or am I within my rights to be genuinely pissed off about this.  It's just a cookie, but that's not the point....\n\n**UPDATE EDIT # 1:** Thank you for the support everybody!  \n\nAbout an hour and a half after I made this post, my Executive Director (ED) came in my office to talk, not about what happened (and I assumed that she didn't know about it) but about normal work business.\n\nWhen she came in my office she noticed that I had the cookie packaging on my desk from yesterday.  She pointed at it and made a frowny face. \n\nI looked at it, looked a her and asked, \"You know about this?\" She immediately closed my office door, sat down and said that the AD told her about it yesterday and asked if our administrative assistant has said anything to me about it today.  I told her that she had still not said anything to me yet, nor did she apologize yesterday.  \"Did she make any plans for restitution?\" she asked. I told her as far as I know she had not, but it wasn't JUST about eating my food. It was about opening my mail, eating my stuff, throwing it away AND not telling me about it until the following week AND not apologizing.\n\nMy ED said that she will have a talk with both the AD and admin asst, because technically since the AD is my direct supervisor it falls within his purview to handle this situation.  And since he ate half of the cookie too he should definitely say something to her.  She that when she talks to the admin asst., she will encourage her to make some sort of restitution.  I told her all I want is a sincere apology, recognition that she fucked up and that it will never happen again. \n\n20 minutes later I saw her pulling the admin asst. into her office.  \n\nI haven't heard anything since.\n\nI'll keep you all updated.

        "text": "(This is about people having fun at work that could be pure drudgery. I am only a bit player, but the story is still worth it.)\n\nBack-story: My job has me working from home. Home was fine, but [wife] and I decided if you can live anywhere, why not someplace fun?  We were able to find a waterfront place in middle-of-nowhere, Florida, with a dock and boat lift. Not expensive, since as I mentioned, it is in fact in the dead center of nowhere. \n\nAfter about four years of enjoying the fishing during the days, as an experiment [wife] and I turned on the light at the end of the dock and I tossed the bait net at about 10 PM. Up came about half a dozen large shrimp! Tossed again, same result. Virtually every throw brings up shrimp! We can’t stop, this is GREAT! Much later we realize it’s now 1 AM, we have pounds and pounds of delicious shrimp, so fresh they are kicking… but no ice to hold them till morning. I need to go buy ice.\n\nIn \"town\" (pop 2000) is an automated ice dispensary where you stick in money and a 20 pound bag of ice drops out. I’m dressed for cast-netting; a swimsuit, t-shirt, sandals. After netting for hours the shirt is much too fishy for the car, so I take off the shirt, sit on a towel so my wet shorts don’t foul the seat, and drive to the icehouse. No one will see me at 1:30 am in MiddleOfNowhere at the off-road icehouse, or care if they do.\n\nIcehouse money-taker-machine is broken. No ice from there.\n\nThe all-night gas station / convenience store on the highway through town is open… and they sell ice! As I walk to the door I see the sign “no shirt, no shoes…” but, I HAVE to have ice!\n\nI step inside. The counter is manned by two ladies.\n\n“I’m sorry I’m not properly dressed, but something has come up, and I have an unexpected, sudden and desperate need for a couple of bags of ice. Can I please buy ice dressed like this, or must I go get a shirt and come back?” (Smile… thinking please please please - just sell me the ice!)\n\nThey look me over and evidently decide that it’s BORING working the wee hours in a town where no one is out at night. Play me for a little bit first.\n\n“Hun, you can come in anytime like that! That sign is just for the nasty 'ol oystermen. Come on in, stay a while! What in the world do you need ice for at this time of night anyway?” Etc., etc. Eventually I told them the required number of jokes, they took my money and I got my ice.\n\nOne would think that was embarrassing, but that’s just because you don’t yet have the Ultimate Embarrassment Benchmark, which follows.\n\nA couple of days later (Saturday morning) [wife] and I are driving out of town. We stop in the same store to get coffee and a couple of chicken biscuits. The place is packed, bustling, loud, and all they have left for breakfast is hot wings and corn dogs. I get coffee and get in the long line. At the counter is one of the ladies from a couple of nights ago. Harried voice: “Did-you find-everything-you-were-looking-for?”\n\n“Well, I was hoping for two chicken biscuits, but I see you’ve had a really busy morning. Just the coffee will do, thanks.”\n\nSudden interest. “Hey... I don’t recognize you, but I know your voice from somewhere?”\n\n“Ice at 1:30 in the morning.”\n\nFace lights up, shouts to back room “HEY! IT’S OUR FUN, WET GUY... ‘CEPT NOW HE’S WEARING CLOTHES! AND HE NEEDS A COUPLE OF CHICKEN BISCUITS!”\n\nPlace falls dead silent, and I can feel every single set of eyes locking on me, speculatively.\n\nFrom the back “OH, LORDY! WE”RE ALL OUT! BUT, TELL HIM TO HANG ON! I’LL PUT TOGETHER SOMETHIN, SOMEHOW!”\n\nAfter an amazingly short (but eternally long) one minute, in which not a single soul in the store said a word or moved a muscle, the other lady comes out with two hot chicken biscuits. I smile, thank them both, pay and leave. At the door I glance back. Every soul is still rooted in place, watching me leave. Even the next person in line has not stepped forward yet. The only motion is the two ladies enthusiastically waving “bye-bye”.\n\nAnd that is why we have to move out of state.\n",

        "text": "FIRST OF ALL: I am apparently gestating my unborn child incorrectly. \n\nFirst trimester- My morning sickness lasted all day long. This Bitch told me I could cure it by eating a very specific brand of crackers first thing in the morning. I ate the crackers, I still threw up, it's almost like morning sickness is just a thing that happens to pregnant people. This Bitch didn't believe that I'd really eaten them, because if I had then I wouldn't have morning sickness anymore. So she threatened to look my mother up on Facebook and tell her that I \"wasn't taking care of myself.\"\n\n\"Don't do that. My mother doesn't know I'm pregnant yet. I'm waiting until the three month mark to tell my family. Also, she lives in another state and I'm a grown-ass woman.\"\n\n\"Oh, I wouldn't tell her that you're *pregnant.* Just that you're not taking care of yourself.\"\n\nSecond trimester- I started wearing baggier clothes. This Bitch lit up like a jack 'o lantern when she saw me come in in yoga pants. She happily told me that I was a mother now, that I was going to dress this way for the rest of my life, and that I'd better get used to it.\n\n\"I still have all my old clothes. I'm sure I'll wear them at some point.\"\n\nNope, I was going to be exhausted and get fat and stop caring how I looked and I'd be too focused on my children to notice. I might *think* that I'd go back to wearing my old clothes, but a year from now I'd realize how right she'd been. Also, my boobs were gonna sag. \n\nThird trimester- \n\nThis Bitch: \"Hey, remember when Other Coworker was pregnant and we raised her desk up like a podium so that she'd be more comfortable? Want us to raise your desk?\"\n\nMe: \"No, not even a little bit. My abdominal muscles feel like someone's been kicking me from the inside for the past six months. I'm perfectly happy hunching over my desk. Bad posture never felt so good.\"\n\nSo, of course, I come in on Monday and my desk is roughly level with my tits.\n\nMaintenance guy: \"This Bitch said that you *really* needed your desk raised. I don't have time to lower it today, but I can probably have it done by tomorrow.\"\n\nI spent the entire day wincing in pain, sitting ramrod-straight and still typing like a little kid who can't reach the bathroom sink. This Bitch argued with me the whole day about how much better this new height was for me. \n\n--------------------------\n\nFor all her opinions on how I wasn't taking care of myself during my pregnancy, This Bitch tried to poison me when I was five months. I have the \"kill you to death\" type of food allergies, specifically the ones that don't even let you stay in the kitchen when someone is cooking with those ingredients. This Bitch knows this. This Bitch also knows that we're not allowed to have food on the floor, period. And yet, This Bitch *insisted* on eating her allergen-filled snack right next to the allergic pregnant lady.\n\n\"Why does my throat itch? Wait, what are you eating?\"\n\n\"Tee-hee! You don't want to know!\"\n\n\"Uh, I think I already do. What the fuck?\"\n\nShe told me she could eat whatever she wanted. I agree with this, but if she's gonna pick the one that murders me, maybe she can eat it in an area where I don't need to be? Where we're actually allowed to have food?\n\n--------------------------\n\nBefore I got pregnant, there was a time when I *almost* escaped sitting next to This Bitch. She has a tendency to be loud. Loud enough that customers on the phone with me would comment on how loud she was being. I would say \"I'm sorry, my coworker is also on the phone,\" which would be a lie because more often than not she was just gossiping loudly over the side of her cube. Until one day she happened to hear me. And decided that an appropriate response would be to come into *my* cube, get her face right up against my face, and say \"hello!\" into the phone *which I was currently speaking into.* Because we work at a Chuck E Cheese and not a large insurance company.\n\nCue me walking up to our boss and saying \"I cannot sit next to her. I *will* not sit next to her. I'm not sitting back down. Move me somewhere else.\" \n\nHe put me in the cube around the corner, which lasted all of two weeks until the ethernet port in that cube died and it was apparently easier just to move me back to my old one.\n\n-------------------------\n\nAt one point, This Bitch decided that she was going to do everyone else's job. Even the jobs of people in other departments which we had not been trained to do, or given the software to do, or the authority, and some of which we were explicitly not allowed to do. She would give customers instructions which sounded wrong even to my untrained, unauthoritative ears. My concerned \"Um, we're *really* supposed to transfer that,\" was met with a snarled \"Don't tell me how to handle my calls!\"\n\nWithin the week our boss was up her ass about all the power she does not wield, despite how important she may think she is.\n\n-------------------------\n\nThis Bitch shouts at anyone who tries to give her a performance review. One of the quality control guys is visibly frightened of her.\n\n-------------------------\n\nThis Bitch is also a self-proclaimed racist. I have one of those names which indicates that my mother thought I was very special. I'm white and my heritage is about as exciting as a bowl of oatmeal, but I can see how someone who's first introduction to me is a phone call might assume there's some cultural origin to my name.\n\nThis is presumably why I got called a whole bucket of racial slurs by a particularly crotchety customer.\n\nWhile I was ranting about my encounter with this delightful gentleman, This Bitch cut me off to say that I couldn't really blame him, since companies really shouldn't be hiring foreign people. \n\nWhen it became clear that I didn't quite understand what she was telling me, she justified her position with several stereotypes and the assertion that everyone needs to learn English. I proceeded to tease her for being racist. She was hurt and said that she'd thought this was a safe space.\n\n------------------------------\n\nWe recently got some new hires who are supposed to be shadowing people as part of their training. Three of my coworkers were out sick today, leaving just me and This Bitch. This Bitch insisted that all the new hires shadow her instead of me because she's the \"senior licensed agent on the floor.\" Our positions and responsibilities are 100% equal, and she got her insurance license several months *after* I did. She readily agreed that I'd finished my qualifications before she did, but that she'd \"since surpassed me and was now in charge.\" Around lunchtime the new hires started deserting her, because apparently she was ignoring their questions. She's not speaking to them, or to me, because I've actually been teaching them things.\n\n",

I know that a lot of people don't really understand insurance, and I get that, and I try to educate our customers the best that I can, but *come on, now.*\n\nI was on the phone for an hour today with a lady whose question basically boiled down to \"If I buy the wrong policy, will it cover me anyway?\"\n\nNo. No, it will not, because what you just asked me is \"If I buy the wrong thing, will it still be right?\" By virtue of it being the wrong thing, *it will not be right.* And if you buy a policy for the wrong thing, *it will cover the wrong thing.* I get that you gave somebody money with the intent to purchase a certain product, but if you mistakenly purchased a *different* product, then you need to take that product back to the store and exchange it, not magically expect it to become the first product because that's what your intent was. \n\nIf you *did* buy the wrong policy, this is a fixable thing. You fix it by calling and saying \"I think I may've bought the wrong policy.\" Then you buy the right policy. What *doesn't* work is debating with the agent about how the wrong policy should really, actually cover you anyway. That's like accidentally buying a banana when you wanted to a pineapple, and then *trying to convince the banana that it's a pineapple* instead of returning it to the store. And then trying to convince your doctor that your vitamin C levels have gone up because of all the pineapples that you've been eating. And then screaming at the grocery clerk because you bought bananas under the *expectation* that they could be pineapples, but it turns out that they'd never stopped being bananas. \n\nAnd maybe the clerk even brought this up to you at some point, but *ohhhh no,* you KNEW that it was okay that you were only buying bananas. Because they were cheaper, or easier to peel, and you were such a savvy shopper, and they'd *have* to raise your vitamin C levels because that was your intent while buying them, *even though you should've been buying pineapples, ya fuckwit.* \n\nJESUS.\n",

Here's a quick update and question.\n\nI finally got a call back from a wonderful temp agency that could get my foot in the door at our local university, which has great benefits and pay. The interview went very well and I gave him a list of solid references that would go to bat for me. Unfortunately, he made it clear that he'd need to contact my former boss (AKA: passive aggressive weirdo who may or may not smear me). \n\nBoss has a history of being untruthful and did NOT want me to collect unemployment. He tried to frame an e-mail I sent him as a resignation letter before they decided to fire me. He then lied to the unemployment office, saying I had been given an official printed warning (detailed in part 3 of \"Working with Weirdos\" if you like a good firing story). \n\nSo how do I handle this? The recruiter gave me his card and encouraged me to reach out with any questions or concerns. Do I let him know that this guy is a little...unconventional? I had to explain why I left the company on my job application and phrased it in neutral terms, something like this:\n\n\"I was the only employee for a new real estate start up co-founded by a husband and wife team. Unfortunately they decided they needed someone with more experience at that stage of their development.\"\n\nI know badmouthing a former employer isn't going to do me any favors but do I have any choice but to sit around and wait for the recruiter to call this guy, presumably first? \n\nAny insight would be great!",

        "text": "Hey guys so I got one that happened to me just yesterday and is kind of funny.\n\n\nSo it was around 5:30pm and the office was empty except for me when I hear a knocking at the backdoor. I figure it's just a truck driver who wanted to sign in or something and failed to read the office hours sign. I ignore it but he keeps knocking harder and harder calling the office main line, so I figure I can tell him that the office is closed and he needs to call the control room to sign in (it's a weird system but oh well). I head to the back door and open it up to a guy covered in mud panting like he just ran a marathon.  Before I can say anything he tells me his truck (semi truck/18 wheeler/lorry) is stuck in some mud and if I could get someone to pull him out. This isn't uncommon since its been raining off and on and the plant is a landmine field of hard mud and quicksand. You never know what it will be until you hit it.  \n\n\nI call the operations manager to see if he has anyone free but turns out to be in the middle of an \"emergency\" and all of my guys have long since gone home. So I decide to do it. The truck driver was trying to park his truck (we allow certain drivers to park at the plant because they are the \"main\" drivers for us) and slide into a ditch. No problem, I'll get the loader and pull him out. He has his own chain so it makes it even easier. I hop into his jeep that he drove over to the admin building and he takes me to one of the loaders. After we get there and I move the loader behind his truck, we hook the chain up to the back of his trailer than to the back of the loader and I slowly pull him out.  Good all done right? Nope\n\n\nAs I backed up the loader so we could unhook the chain, the ground gave way under the loader and it began to slip into the ditch. I tried all my old tricks, pushing with the bucket,  rocking back and forth, than side to side but nope she found some quicksand mud. So the driver gets the idea, hey we still have the chain connected, I'll pull you out now.  He jumps back into his truck and pulls me backwards. Only problem is he drives straight into the spot he was just stuck in. Now that I'm free I pull him free, again, and drive further back to give him room to turn.  Being as careful as I can, I back up once more to release the chain only to see that his truck is now sliding deeper into the ditch and in a panic he drives forward, pulling me with him into the ditch.\n\n\nThere we sat, me sitting in about a foot of mud, him stuck pretty much at the bottom of the ditch now, unable to break free. Luckly we have 2 loaders on site so after I got the first loader unstuck, we daisy chained (tied one loader to the other) the loaders and with the help of an irritated ops manager, we dragged the truck a good 1/8th of a mile out of the ditch and on to the asphalt.  He decided that he would just drive his truck home that day and my day that was suppose to end at 5 didn't end till 6:30.\n\n\nTIL Don't answer the door....",

We ran a background check on this applicant (like we always do) and it wasn't pretty. This applicant has quite the rap sheet:\n\n* Shoplifting\n* Impersonating an Officer\n* Deposit Account Fraud (writing bad checks)\n* Theft\n* Criminal Trespassing\n\nAnd all within the past decade. Obviously, we took a look at this background check, as well as the complete lack of references, and told this applicant that we would not be interested in offering them a position.\n\n*T: Wake Up*\n\nHuh? Oh... oh right... we do not run background checks on potential hires, let alone existing employees, and the applicant was not someone looking to be hired, it was Marsha.\n\nClearly, someone took a dump on an already crappy situation, and Eric just made me a Janitor hat.\n\n**Prologue:** I am a former white-hat hacker who studied fraud investigation in college, and I got bait-and-switched from a simple bookkeeping job into a nasty situation that no amount of coursework could have prepared me for.\n\n**The Players:**\n\n* T: Me, probably should have taken up a career as a private investigator.\n* E: Owner, Provider of either the greatest or worst opportunity I could have ever asked for... probably both.\n* M: Marsha, rated \"F\" for Felon.\n\nI probably should have led this story telling you all that I had fraud investigation and penetration testing training, but I think that would have given away the surprise! On top of the 10-15 years of colorful history with the local court system (which, of course, only covers this one court system, doesn't look at anything that might have been done in other states or counties), I also found a plethora of blog posts specifically targeting Marsha outlining the terrible ways she had impacted these people's lives.\n\nI can't imagine how absolutely toxic someone would have to be to inspire blog posts...\n\nWait... I can.\n\nAt this point, I'm in full investigation mode, pulling an all-nighter (and claiming sweet, sweet time-and-a-half) looking through our systems for evidence of fraud.\n\nThe problem wasn't finding evidence, the problem was that our entire SYSTEM was evidence. No accounts added up, very few GAAP procedures were followed, and I could see about eighteen different ways that money could have been funneled out of the firm. The problem is that investigating any one of those lines is horribly time consuming, and so far the end of the line added up, it was just that we had not reconciled our accounts in two years. Eventually, my actual work caught back up with me, and I could not continue my investigation in earnest...\n\nBut the story does not quite end there.\n\n**To Be Continued...**",

I am a Logistics coordinator and the guys who work the pads are my guys. Meaning I'm their supervisor. I am new to the supervisor gig, having only been doing it for 2ish years The maintance manager has been with the company for about a year and a half but has something like 40 years in the industry. He is good at what he does which is dealing with the alcohol making side of everything. So good in fact, that when he put out he was looking for a new job, companies where sending him offers to try to get him. But when it comes to heavy machinery, he barely knows the basics of them. We have a well documented history of us butting heads since he constantly feels the need to tell my guys how to do their jobs which in turn ends up being worst and harder on the machines than they currently where doing it.  He knows I'm new to being a supervisor and I feel this has something to do with that.\n\n\nMe will be me.\n\nMM is the maintance manager\n\nThe kid is the guy who was driving the telehandler.\n\nBM is the boss man over me and MM.\n\n\nWe had the meeting at 7am since that's when the kids shift starts and today is suppose to be my day off. I'll start off after the red tape crap which explains what the meeting is about and the goal of said meeting, which is to figure out the real cause and persons at fault. Forgive formatting again I'm on my phone having breakfast at a restaurant.\n\n\nBM: So kid, tell us everything that happened before the accident.\n\n\nKid: MM came up to me around 7:30am and told me to extend the arm out and push the wetcake by driving into it so we would stop breaking the hydrolics. JackSego came around about 30 minutes later and told me to do it like we normally do and that he would see if we can pull some rails out so I could push from the side. MM came by a few minutes later and told me to do it like he said and that he would talk to JackSego. I tried to get a hold of JackSego on the radio but couldn't get a hold of him so I started doing it like MM wanted. Everything went fine till the arm snapped.\n\n\nBM: Did you do anything different?\n\n\nKid: Nothing really, just the same thing I had been doing.\n\n\nBM: JackSego why couldn't he get you on the radio?\n\n\nMe: I had my radio turned down and forgot to turn it up when I went into the plant and didn't hear it. (since I work in the office now I don't keep my radio full blast, the plant is on average 100db at any given location, this is a common problem we have with people who work/go to the office. I know it's not an excuse but I'm human)\n\n\nBM: MM where you aware that JackSego advised him not to do it the way you suggested?\n\n\nMM: Yes the kid told me, but if he had been doing it exactly like I told him than nothing-\n\n\n(at this point I get fed up with his bullshit)\n\n\nMe: he should have never been told to do it like that to begin with. It doesn't take much to see that the arm will break like it did. Why didn't you bring this up with me? Haven't we already discussed this? Any problems you have with how something is being done on the pad you take it up with me.\n\n\nMM: You know how many times I have called (the rental company) to come fix it. Why didn't you do something sooner?\n\n\nMe: There isn't much that can be done. Those machines are not meant to do that (push wetcake in any manner) what do you think is going to happen?  Of course they are going to get torn up. Until we make a path we don't have any other options. If you came to me first than we could have figured out a better plan.\n\n\nMM: He still wasn't doing it like I told him to, if he did, the arm wouldn't have broken.\n\n\nAt this point I know that this is his only argument and was expecting it to boil down to that. Over the weekend I had been in touch with our safety guy (during this whole thing he is doing contractor orientation and couldn't attend) and asked him to look into the equipment training records to see if MM had completed them. He had not for whatever reason.\n\n\nMe: In all truth, you should not be the person telling people how to operate machines you yourself are not qualified to operate. I checked with (safety guy) and you never did the licensing tests. Have you even driven a telehandler like that one?\n\n\n(this has been my biggest pet peeve while I worked with machines, having someone who has never driven a machine telling others how to operate it. This is dangerous and reckless. If the person can not demostrat what they are asking in a proficient manner than always get another opinion and a more skilled set of eyes to either agree or disagree with their methods)\n\n\nBM:Alright guys let's settle down. MM we have discussed you bring any concerns to JackSego first and letting him a deal with it. This is his area and has a lot of experience in working the pads and the machines.  I agree with you that something needs to be done about how we handle this but we need to work as a team to solve these issues. You said he wasn't doing it like you told him, what exactly was he doing wrong?\n\n\n\nMM: He was pushing too much at once, I told him to only use half the bucket but he must have been using the whole thing for it to break like that.\n\n\nMe: Did you see him use the whole bucket? You where right next to me and we all didn't see the bucket go into the wetcake. \n\n\nBM: Would using half the bucket kept the arm from breaking?\n\n\nMe: No, the wetcake piles up inside the bucket after a few feet and once it does it gets sucked down causing the arm to bow like we saw.  It would only be a matter of time before it broke. What he suggested was dangerous and unnecessary, he could have caused the kid to get seriously hurt and only shows his lack of understanding on how to operate those machines safely and since he is not even trained to use them should not be giving advice on them.  I was already taking care of the problem when he told the kid to keep doing it his way.\n\n\nBM: Kid, did you tell MM that JackSego was working on it?\n\n\nThe kid: Yes, I told him JackSego was looking for him to remove some rails.\n\n\nBM: Ok well, you can head back to work, I'll be in touch with you later.\n\n\n(kid leaves)\n\n\nBM: Ok so here is how I see it. MM you should have talked to JackSego before doing anything, and also since you are not licensed to operate the telehandler you are not permitted to instruct others how to do so. (this I didn't even know was a thing since everyone does it, but the policy reads 'non-licensed emploees are not permitted to operate or ASSIST in the operation of rolling stock' pretty much my company has a don't touch policy, but since everyone is trained on everything during their orientation it's not a big deal, MM wasnt). This isn't the first time you have done this so we will discuss this later. \n\n\nFrom this point forward BM tells MM that he is not to instruct my guys unless what they are doing is a safety risk and that he will need to undergo the training for the equipment. Than proceeds to scold us for how we acted. Fair enough I guess. I'm currently going to try to get some of the kids vacation hours back. I won't be able to get them all since any accident, regardless of fault, requires a drug test and a tempary suspension till the results are back, but I might be able to get a couple of days back at least. Other than the incident report which is mandatory the kid is not being held resonsible for what happened.\n\nTL:DR Maintiance manager screwed himself by telling someone how to do a job he didn't know how to do. The kid is in the clear.\n\n\nEdit: typos",

You don't need to let the administrator know when you need her to complete work by. If she asks for a timescale do not commit to an answer. Or ask when *she* thinks it should be done by. Basically, be as awkward as possible. \n\n3. If you need something with a tight deadline completing, ensure that you do not give the administrator all of the required resources until 45 mins before she leaves / the deadline. This way you can complain that she was unhelpful and failed to do her job. \n\n4. If you f*ck up majorly, don't worry about it. We'll blame it on the admin. And if we can't because she documents everything then we'll just sweep it under the rug. ",

I learn best in the crucible. I learned this specific version of Quickbooks's unique functions faster and better by being told to \"figure it out\" by Eric as opposed to me taking a college course on it.\n\nAlright, que up the Benny Hill Theme.\n\n**How To Apply for a Customer Loan**\n\n&gt; M: First you have to fill out a credit application, then you have to run a background check and credit check and send that documentation to the bank, then you have to call in the application to the bank, then you have to wait 3-5 days for the approval, then if it is not approved you have to sacrifice a virgin to Baphomet, then you have to... (There's a flow chart, it's two pages long)\n\n*T: Leave M's Office, Call Bank*\n\n&gt; T: Hi there, I would like to get our customer a loan.\n\n&gt; Bank: No problem, did you download the phone app?\n\n&gt; T: ......\n\nThere is an app for that, and this app not only gets you the approval within about 15-30 minutes (from opening the app to receiving the result, not just submission to approval), it can also populate all areas of the form either by scanning the barcode on the back of a driver's license, or by looking up the house you are at via your GPS.\n\n**Dat Asset Doe**\n\n&gt; T: Hey E, why does our Accounts Receivable report have these negative numbers on it?\n\n&gt; E: Well, if a customer pays their deposit, but cancels the job after the three day recission period, we keep the money on our books as a credit for the customer to use later.\n\n&gt; T: Um, then it's not an asset, and should not be in this report.\n\n*M: Enter office.*\n\n&gt; M: What are you guys talking about?\n\n&gt; T: These credits are not assets, they should be liabilities.\n\n&gt; M: You don't understand. They're creditted against the original invoice, so they stay in our accounts receivable.\n\nAt this point, I drop it. It's a bookkeeping issue that will need to be addressed later, and I have customers to collect from.\n\nNet result, for non-accountants, is that instead of our income being +$1,000 and our customer's credit liability being +$1000, our income is -$1000 and our customer's credit liability is 0. This is bad, and wrong, and I had to take a sick day to recover after hearing this from, functionally, the CFO. (If I'm off on my explanation, I pray the IRS gods are merciful. I would like individual, unique comments from everybody telling me how wrong I am and how I better pray we don't get auditted. Just upvoting the one comment that outlines how I'm wrong simply will not suffice)\n\n**I am the King of Games**\n\nWe have an account at a local appliance wholesaler. While we VERY rarely include appliances in our deals, we regularly allow customers to go to the wholesaler to buy their appliances of choice using our account to not only get a steep discount over retail, but also give a partner of ours some additional business. Basically, partner charges our account, customer pays that ammount immediately, everybody's happy.\n\nWe start receiving invoices for customers who bought appliances on our account, but we were not providing the appliances. One of the invoices is for a customer whose account I was micromanaging due to size and because she tried the excuse once that she was not prepared for a payment, and so I proceeded to call her twice a week for the remainder of her project.\n\n&gt; T: Eric, I received this invoice from -Appliance Store- (\"A\"). I am asking you to directly tell me to call A about this invoice.\n\n&gt; E: Well yeah, call them, but if you already know you need to call them, why do you need me to tell you to?\n\n&gt; T: Because I'm psychic.\n\n&gt; E: Ooooooookay...\n\nI wait until I see N, the project manager who directly told me to micromanage this customer, go into M's office. N has been working at the firm longer than me and M combined, and I put him at around 3rd in command, but our command structure is kind of loose.\n\n*T: Call A*\n\n&gt; T: Hey A, slight problem over here. I have an invoice in my system for customer X, can you look it up and tell me if it has been paid?\n\n&gt; A: Sure, can you give me the invoice number?\n\n&gt; *Internal T: There it is.*\n\n&gt; T: One second, let me go grab the paper invoice from M.\n\n*T: Walk to M's office, say hi to N, quickly go to vendor file to pull invoice*\n\n&gt; M: What are you doing?\n\n&gt; T: Pulling the invoice for customer X from A.\n\n&gt; M: Why?\n\n&gt; T: E told me to get this resolved ASAP since we'd have to invoice the custo...\n\n&gt; M: Transfer A to me.\n\n&gt; T: What?\n\n&gt; M: You're not doing that. I will tell you what does and does not fall inside your scope of work. Transfer A to me.\n\n&gt; T: Ok, boss.\n\n&gt; *Internal T: You just activated my trap card.*\n\n*T: Enter own office, transfer A.*\n\n*N: Enter T's office*\n\n&gt; N: Did that just happen?\n\n&gt; T: Did what just happen?\n\n&gt; N: Did M just tell you that what she tells you to do is more important than what E tells you to do?\n\n&gt; T: Yeah, wasn't the first time, won't be the last.\n\n&gt; N: I'm going to go talk to E.\n\nSome subreddits like /r/talesfromtechsupport have rules about having multiple mini-stories in one big story. These stories are all related because they demonstrate that M lies (poorly) to maintain control, doesn't quite understand the details of accounting, and will directly take away assignments from me that were assigned by E.\n\nM caught a pretty severe tongue-lashing from E as a result. The yelling between them had become so regular that when E asked me to look into a Hi-Fi setup for us to play music in the showroom, I responded that the music of their shouting matches was plenty.\n\nOverall, things are reasonable at this point. Yeah, M still makes some assignments take twice to three times as long to complete, but I'm getting work done and things are smooth..................\n\nThen I decided to google Marsha.\n\n**To Be Continued...**",

        "text": "So I have another tale of heavy machinery mishaps but unlike the other 2 I posted the other day, this one will be more light hearted.\n\nIt happened damn near 9 years ago back when I would help my uncle out on his farm.  It was around october so as you can imagine things are going full steam ahead. My uncles storage bins where full and we started a grain pile so we didn't have to stop the harvest.  The pile was a pretty good size (corn) topping in at about 400k bushels and since the weather was taking a turn for the worst we had to focus on getting all that corn out of there asap.  I am normaly the one who ran his front end loader, a big old girl that could load a truck in 3 buckets, but on this day my uncle wanted my help fixing a few things so we got his other nephew (a cocky little 18 yr) to run the loader since the trucks do not like to be kept waiting.  He pulls up in his camaro and parks opposite the side the trucks are going to be loaded on. So to paint a picture for you guys/gals, you have a wall of corn infront of you, trucks to the left of you and his car on the right of you with the front of the car pointed towards the corn pile and the loader is sitting in the middle of all this scooping and dumping.  I go and meet the little bastard and explain to him what needs to be done, some dos and dont's, and explain to him to go slow.  It had rained a bit the night before so the ground was slicker than hell and it would get worst before it got better.  Mainly I didn't want him doing any damage to the trailers since that would come out of our pocket.  \n\nI stay and watch him a bit, giving pointers here and there as he gets the hang of it.  He isn't the fastest guy in the world but he had the trucks moving so I jumped into the old truck and headed off to go help my uncle.  It took about 20 minutes to get to where I needed and right around the time I pulled up to the shop, one of the truck drivers lights up the radio.\n\n\"JackSego, you better be getting back here. This numb nuts in the loader ran over his car.\" \n\nNow you can imagine my shock when I heard this.  I get on the radio and try to reach the kid but he won't answer. I wave my uncle over, let him know what went down and we head back to the corn pile.  We get there and see the lights of the loader shining through the trucks and pull up to a circus.  All of the drivers where out of their trucks, some of the older guys gathered in a group just pointing and laughing. The younger ones all surronding the loader and car and it wasnt clear just what happened till we started making our way over.  \n\nYou know those forensic shows where they put the clues together and they solve a crime using science? Well when it comes to reading tire tracks, I happen to know a thing or too and can paint a picture of how someone was driving just from looking at the tire tracks, so let me tell you what I saw.  Leading up to the pile was 2 solid, none tread bearing tire marks. This tells me the kid was flooring it and spinning the tires, thats an easy one. Next coming back from the pile, it goes from 2 solid none treaded tire marks into 2 tire marks with grooves cut into it and a solid tire \"foot print\" at the end. This means he floored it going in reverse, slammed on the brakes and slide (about a good 10yrds) than stopped.  Leading up to the trucks it was normal tire marks so at least the idiot was being careful when approaching the them. The real problem came when he went to reverse though.  He floored it, tried to stop but couldn't and slammed a IIRC 60,000lbs loader into the side of his car.\n\nWe walked up to the car-loader combo and see his little baby stuck under the loader a good 3ft, with the corner of the loaders bumber stuck on the A pillar (the beam that seperates your windshield from your door).  Not going to lie, I laughed for a bit as did my uncle. The kid didn't take to kindly to that but honestly there was nothing else for us to do.  He told us the loader just started sliding even when he was driving slow.  The tire marks as well as the 9 some odd drivers said otherwise.  We got the chain out from the truck. Tied one end to his car the other end to the truck. Drove the loader one way, the truck the opposite way and presto the kid was now the proud owner of the worlds 1st half convertible camaro.\n\nThe kid did finish off the day incident free but never again came to help.  We still poke fun of him to this day.\n\nPost Write: Spelling isn't my strong suit and since I am at home today on my computer I didn't have autocorrect to lend me a hand. I proof read the best I could but well if I don't know how to spell it to begin with than reading over it won't do much good either.  Still tons of stories for those interested, just let me know and i'll keep them coming.",

        "text": "Here is another mishap that happened just last week and it ended up costing over $130k in damages.\n\nHere at the ethanol plant we have 2 huge pits (roughly 50yds x 25yds and 6yds at its deepest) that we us to store wetcake, which is a byproduct of the ethanol process and is just the solid corn after its been fermented. It is used as fed for cattle and we have a lot of it. So much in fact that the ramp that is used to drive the front-end loaders into said pad is covered with this stuff. If we don't work our way into the pad the trucks will end up not getting loaded because the free flowing stuff can only go so far before it stops falling on to the loading belts. To do this, we use a telehandler which is [this](https://www.google.com/search?q=telehandler&amp;client=ms-android-verizon&amp;prmd=ivsn&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiWvp643pTPAhVFcz4KHUxmCaoQ_AUIBygB&amp;biw=360&amp;bih=518#imgrc=9ya2aLmt2C8hzM%3A) only this is the model we have to rent because the tiny one the plant owns is too weak and small.  Now these machines are not meant to be pushing several thousand pounds of wetcake with its boom arm. This detroys the hydrolics and causes a great number of headaches if not done correctly.  Since I no longer work the pads and it's a fresh batch of newbies working them, they have been tearing that poor thing apart, forcing us to call the service guy a lot (13 times in 3 weeks) and it's not cheap. The newish maintance manager is(MM) is fed up with it since it comes out of his budget and suggest a new way to do it.\n\nHis plan is to just have them extend the arm out (it goes to 30ft) and just drive in there using the engine and transmission to push this stuff till it can't drive any further up than rinse and repeat. You see where this is going right? Now I hear of this half baked idea and immediately try to put a stop to this. The MM is a stubborn fool. He will not listen to anyone because he \"forgot more than you will ever know\" and spends the next hour arguing with both me and our boss. So to settle the argument we walk to the pads and watch as the kid in the telehandler is doing as he was told. Every time he drives the telehandler into the wetcake, arm fully extended, burying the bucket into the wetcake to help push it further into the pad and into the loading belts, the arm is bowing. I look over to the MM and tell him again, what will happen if they keep it up. Well I don't know if it was because the kid saw us watching him, or he was just overly eager but on his next push, he guns it. The bucket on the end of the arm hits the wetcake and the arm bows hard. Than keeps going. Than with the nastiest metalic snap I have heard, the arm breaks in 2. It has so much force behind it that the telehandler lifted its front tires off the ground a good 3 feet.  \n\nNow we have about 15ft of arm sinking into the 180 degree (F) wetcake, a kid who wish he wore his brown pants, gallons of hydrolic fluid spraying out of the hoses that got ripped out and one MM who was wide eyed, dropped jaw speechless. After a moment to collect his wits he turned to us and said this line.\n\n\"Steel ain't suppose to snap like that\"\n\nIn total\n$128k for the machine\n$1200 for the crane\n$3000 for the service call and pick up\n\nThe worst part though and this really kills me, MM pinned it all on the kid who is now suspened till further notice. I'm trying to fix this because he was only doing what he was told to do by a dumbass.\n\nPost writing: just to be clear I went and stopped the kid 1st but MM went and made him keeping doing it the way he wanted not but 10 minutes after I stopped it. Which is when we started arguing.",

        "text": "Background,\n\nStory starts in paragraph 2.\n\nI am an equipment operator by heart, I have over a decades worth of experience under my belt and I take pride in my ability to operate a number of industrial vehicles and equipment types safetly, correctly and to their absolute limit of the need calls for it.  At the time this story takes place (3 years-ish ago) I was the main front-end loader operator at the ethanol plant I work at now. Given my experience in those machines I was hands down the best the company had and still has, havn't gotten soft sinced I moved up, and they knew it. By policy, the safety guy is the one who is tasked in training people on how to operate the equipment but he knew little to nothing about them and had passed the job on to me. I didn't mind, watching new people try to drive that stuff is funny as hell.  Well he ended up getting replaced by another safety guy for some reason and told him of the arrangement we had going. The guy acknowledged it and took full control. Enter new hires.\n\nThe new safety guy was doing his usual walk around the plant with the new hires and it was time to train them on the rolling stock (front-end loaders, skid steers, telehandlers ect.) and I went over like I normally use to so I could take over.  The 1st thing he was going to teach was the front-end loader.  He sees me walking up and says he has it all under control and was an old pro. I'm not one to judge books by their covers but when this pencil pusher took 5 minutes to find the fuel cap and another 5 just trying to start it, I knew that in the interest of safety I better take over.  I walk back up to him and pull him aside. Now other than 3 other guys, I'm one of the most senior employees here and I use my, \"your fucking up voice\" to get him to listen.  We move away from the new hires so he doesn't get embarrassed and I start to tell him that having an inexperienced driver teach people how to operate a 28,000lb machine could result in someone getting killed, he scuffs at me and throws the policy in my face.  I have a short fuse so I just walk off to keep from esculating and notify the supervisor of the situation.  We both stand a ways back, gathering the rest of the new hires near us to keep them safe and watch as he jumps into the driver seat with the new hire crammed in next to him. He starts the machine up and heads for a vacant dirt lot that is down a pretty steep hill.  Now if you don't know much about loaders, they don't have suspension. Just big ol bouncy tires that can get out of hand real quick if it's rough enough. Well just before the hill you have to turn off the road which has a good 5 inch drop off.  The safety guy, with out even touching the brake, takes this dip going about 15mph. They both lurch forward but since the new hire couldn't buckle in he head butted the windshield. \n\nYou think it's over. Oh no. Remember the bouncy tires? Well in a panic the safety guy slams on the brakes and causes the new hire to face plant the windshield again, than again. Have you ever tried brining 28,000lbs to a stop on a hill while going down it? Doesn't work to well. So the loader starts hopping a bit all the while causing this poor guy to smack his face into the windshield over and over again. By the time it stopped the windshield was shattered, the new hire had 2 skull fractures and a serious concussion. To top it off the safety guy was fired and the policy was changed to include \"or most senior equipment operator\".\n\nThe next new safety guy actually had someone cover my job for a week so I could teach him everything I knew about the equipment and even had me make tests up for him to take. That new hire never came back.\n\nTL:DR Want to be know-it-all safety guy destroys a new hires face because he is too cocky to admit when he is out of his depth.\n\nEdit: spacing and stuff\n\n\nI have a whole novel of stories about people causing chaos in these machines, ranging from millions of dollars in damage, to fires, to someone destroying their own car with a front-end loader. If you want more let me know.\n",

        "text": "Some time ago, I was assigned the task of responding, in my boss’s stead, to an email that had sat withering in his inbox for weeks. More precisely, the message was a recent one whose sender was following up on something sent weeks earlier, asking for my boss’s attention to the matter at hand. So it was that I was called in to save the day…something, something, fate of the free world. Obviously.\n\nThe task turned out to have to do with a concept known as ‘Business Continuity Planning’ (BCP). The basic idea is this: if the building were to be overrun with locusts, or Pokemon Goers, or some other scourge of the earth causing an interruption to business activities, how fucked would the company be? In particular, what is the dollar value of the portion of fuckedness that our department, specifically, would contribute to the overall fuckedness of the company in the event of some kind of shutdown? (Aside: BCP sometimes includes drafting a communication plan to be enacted in the event of such a shutdown and testing the phone/SMS/MySpace tree to be employed at that time. I remember this from earlier in my career, when part of this task involved my boss phoning me after hours to ensure that she had the ability to reach me at home, as I frantically scrambled to put on pants before answering the phone. I’m no expert, but in my estimation, it’s weird as hell to talk to your boss with your genitals exposed.)\n\nAnyway, the task of quantifying the financial impact to the company of a shutdown to our department took the form of a questionnaire, asking things like “quantify the loss of sales that a one-week interruption to your department’s activities would cause”, or “quantify the damage to the company’s reputation/brand…”, etc.\n\nAs luck would have it, all I was actually being asked to do was ‘update’ the questionnaire that our department had submitted the previous year, because here in corporate paradise, we only ever do things as efficiently as possible (duh). Now in this case, the word “update” actually meant “review”, and the word “review” turned out to mean “read this 5-page document, do nothing with it, then jump out a window because your life is literally worthless”.\n\nThat’s right – question after question, page after page, the quantifiable value of my department’s activities (my pride! my joy! my reason for being!) stared me in the face: zero. And quite rightly, I might add. Fines or penalties incurred? Zero. Losses resulting from delays? Zero. Losses resulting from breach of contract? Zero.\n\nMy task was to sign off on a document explicitly stating that my entire department could meet its demise in a freak gasoline-fight accident and the company wouldn’t suffer so much as the equivalent of a spilled glass of kool-aid (still just pennies per existential crisis!).\n\nBut of course, I’m just kidding. I wasn’t authorized to sign off on the document myself! (How could you be so gullible? lol) That honor could only belong, by policy, to my boss. So I printed the document and put it on his desk with a sticky note encouraging him to “sign here :)”, because he could rest easy: I had verified – and would stake my professional reputation on the fact – that everything was as it should be.\n\nEDIT: I'm new here so I don't know the rules, but I imagine self-promotion is a no-no. The above is original content (in that I wrote it), but does also appear on a blog that I recently started as an outlet for this sort of thing. DM me for the link if interested (it's not tough to find...), or correct me if I'm indeed allowed to post that link here. Thanks!",

        "text": "Before my time as a pharmacy tech, I worked in the stock department of a grocery store. Retail...retail is awful. Work in retail for at least 6 months, then get out and never look back. It'll give you a brand-new appreciation of life and all the people who do the behind-the-scenes work.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**STORE DEPARTMENTS, IN ORDER OF PRODUCTIVITY:**\n\n**Meat**: Get, in, get the job done, get out. Staffed exclusively with burly, no-nonsense, bearded men able to talk for hours on the finer points of lobster sushi or the best way to cook a T-bone steak.\n\n**Deli**: A crew of misfits. Crosseyed Bob, Fireman Sandwich Chuck, \"I can't see over the counter\" Dorothy, and others. Steady workers, tendency towards anxiety attacks when the rushes hit.\n\n**Stock**: The underdogs - perhaps with good reason, as most turned out to be lying thieves. Home department of yours truly, who contrived to make my absence apparent whenever it seemed that theft might be on the horizon.\n\n**Dairy**: Eternally busy, never got any work done. The milk was always well-stocked, though.\n\n**Produce**: True scumbags. Staffed entirely by employees kicked out of or otherwise deemed unfit for other departments.\n\n*****\n\nMy previous stories:\n\n* [A collection of ladies](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePharmacy/comments/4zoz4v/a_collection_of_ladies/)\n\n* [The time the police were called](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePharmacy/comments/4z82xk/the_time_the_police_were_called/)\n\n*****\n\nFor some reason, theft appears to be particularly rampant in the grocery-store business. My personal belief is that the reasons for this boil down into three main factors:\n\n* **Lack of investment**. Unless you aim for a management or ownership track, it's difficult to make a career in the grocery-store industry. Hence, the people hired are typically those without careers, whether inexperienced college students or people between more substantial jobs. This also results in a high turnover, meaning that the people working in the store don't have much of an investment in the company.\n\n* **Low pay**. Stocking shelves, for the most part, is a task that requires little skill or training to perform adequately. Management is not about to pay top dollar for \"unskilled labor\", and has little incentive to raise pay much above minimum wage, especially in areas where there's no shortage of people looking for jobs.\n\n* **Easy pickings**. If you can dispose of the evidence immediately (by eating it), the barrier to theft is all but removed. It's the work of a moment to grab a handful of something and pop it in your mouth. I've personally seen people do this literally behind a manager's back or while they were in the same room but looking the other way.\n\nThese three factors combined tend to provide people with a lot more incentive to grab something small without paying for it than there might be in other industries. Obviously, my points above are not one-size-fits-all, but rather based on my personal experience. The grocery store I worked at hosted more than its fair share of theft, and I saw a lot of it in the stock room.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#Meat\n\nNobody ever stole in this department. Each and every employee was a salaried professional who took their job seriously. The most that ever happened was when a customer ordered grilled shrimp 10 minutes before closing, then left the store and never came back. Rather than waste the food by throwing it out, the meat guy gave it to Stock to divvy up and consume.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#Deli\n\nThe few perks of working at the store were housed in Deli. Deli employees would create sandwiches upon request, which other employees could then purchase at reduced cost. This led to all sorts of interesting experimental favorites, including but not limited to:\n\n* *The Fireman*: Habanero cheese, jalapeño, black-pepper turkey, Buffalo chicken, chipotle sauce\n\n* *The BJ*: London broil, pepper jack, honey ham, Provolone, ketchup, and mustard\n\n* *The Melt*: Pulled pork, sharp Cheddar, mayo; toasted in oven until cheese melted\n\nThe second perk was only available occasionally, and then only near closing time. A cookie jar was kept off to the side so that exasperated parents could give their little brats an unnecessary reward to temporarily quell their screaming. Every morning it was refilled with fresh product, and an hour or so before closing they would start giving out the remainder to employees. The evil sons of goats in Produce would wait until exactly one hour before closing, then go clean out the jar.\n\nDeli employees would post a guard to their walk-in refrigerator and eat a drumstick or two inside or give themselves samples of the meats and cheeses - sometimes they would sample 2 or 3 meats and cheeses at once along with a small sample of bread...\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#Stock\n\nThe back room that housed the Stock department had no cameras. None whatsoever. This astonishing lack of foresight must have cost the company hundreds of dollars per week, because by and large the Stock employees were lazy, thieving sneaks. In my first few months at the store, no less than 5 people were fired from Stock alone for stealing products, notably:\n\n* *Condom Guy*, who walked out into the aisles in full view of the store cameras, grabbed a pack of condoms, put them in his pocket, then walked back into the Stock room.\n\n* *Skittles Guy*, who denied stealing anything but was betrayed by the rattling noise he made when he walked away - caused by the **3 open packs** of unpaid-for Skittles in his pockets.\n\n* *Lunch Guy*, who took his discounted sandwich from the deli, grabbed a bag of chips from the front registers, set them on a shelf in the middle of Aisle 5, and started eating his lunch. The store manager confronted him, then called his bluff by dragging him to the front and asked every single cashier who'd been on duty for the past 4 hours if they'd rung him up. Upon receiving a truthful \"no\" from each cashier, Lunch Guy was sacked on the spot, but rehired a year later on the good word of his sister, a cashier.\n\nSome additional figures who still live on in legend and myth as they were never caught:\n\n* *Phantom Guy*, who occasionally compiled a pallet of assorted foodstuffs in the Stock room throughout the day, clocked out at the end of his shift, then drove his pickup to the back dock and loaded it up before driving away.\n\n* *Night Crew*, who were locked in at night and had free run of the store for an entire 8-hour shift. They used that time to, apparently, break down pallets, leave muddy footprints on top of the customer service counter, and leave the wrappers of their stolen snack food on the shelves.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#Dairy\n\nEach member of Dairy had at least one small container of chocolate milk, orange juice, or other stolen beverage chilling in their walk-in at all times. Their cartons of milk and ice cream provided convenient places to rest their weary bones from the toils of the day as they sipped on an ice-cold drink of their choice. One guy in particular liked to make chocolate milk using his own personal recipe: one swig of milk held in mouth, with chocolate syrup added to taste before swallowing.\n\nA favorite pastime of the Dairy department was to open cans of biscuits and toss the lumps of raw dough at the ceiling hard enough to make them stick. Over time, they would congeal, then petrify. A few times a year, the manager would send up a crew on a high ladder to take a chisel - yes, an actual chisel - and a HAMMER to break the fossilized biscuits off the ceiling.\n\nAll members of Dairy were virtually untouchable as their manager was fiercely loyal to them and would fight tooth and nail against anyone daring to profane the name of Dairy.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#Produce\n\nA more corrupt den of layabouts, morons, and generally awful people was not to be found for miles around. The fiendish Produce employees conspired together to do one thing, and one thing only: **avoid work**. Produce was restocked exactly twice a day: once in the morning and once in the evening. There was no work to be done in the back room, for all of Produce's sellable goods were shipped in boxes whose final resting place was directly on top of the Produce displays. Once the shifty ProduGuys completed this onerous and difficult task, they were free to sit down in the back and get back to what really mattered - catching up on their sleep.\n\nI cannot count the number of times I walked into the Produce room for one reason or another and woke a sleeping ProduGuy. A few of the more industrious ones brought books to read, and one enterprising fellow actually brought a pillow.\n\nOut on the Produce dock was the soda truck, filled with all sorts of deliciously sweet beverages. When the ProduGuys were thirsty, they would walk into the truck - out of view of the sole camera on that dock - crack open a soda can or bottle, take a swig, then walk back out and abandon the container to be discovered later. The brave ones would grab a 6-pack and take it over to Dairy to cool off in the walk-in before consumption.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*****\n\nI did my best to stay away from all of this madness and to make it clear that I was not a participant in any of it. I was content to buy items before consuming them and to refrain from consuming items I had not bought. As a result, 5 months after I started I was the second-most senior member of the Stock department.",

The ones next to the day parking spot were okay working at since people acted sober. But there was one entrance next to a camping area. The people who stayed there were sort of drunk all the time. \n\nAnyway. One race track festival I was working in that particular camping entrance. It was a hot, sweaty day with a lot of naked torsos walking around keeping up the good work drinking beer instead of water. (I actually met one of them who mixed beer with yoghurt.)\n\nFrom far I saw two men, about 55 years old.\nSince it was so many years ago I don´t remember how the conversation went, but one of the men (who could have been my father if I was less fortunate) clearly tried to flirt with me. \nHe was kinda bushy looking with long grey hair, a leather west over his otherwise naked upper body, and a worn out cowboy hat covering what I guess was a bald patch (reminder; this is not america...). \nThe friend looked really embarrased and tried to cut to the case and buy the tickets they were there for, but the cowboy dude just kept on flirting.\n\nI didn´t respond to the \"cowboy\" flirting for obvious reasons, I just laughed nervously and looked everywhere but into his eyes.\nAfter what felt like ages the two men walked away a few metres and started to whisper to each other. \nI was just standing there with a stiff smile, being a seventeen year old and all that.\nThey came back. The man with the cowboy hat walked up to the counter as the other one stood behind even more embarrased.\nCowboy dude picked up a piece of fabric from the inside of his west and gave it to me. It was wet and dirty from his chest sweat.\n\nThen he said: I beg you pardon, I never promised you a rose garden.\n\nMy response: What?\n\nHe repeated himself.\n\nI just stared. A bit frightened.\n\nAt that point I guess it finally appeared to him I wasn´t interessed and that the whole situation was just.. nope. He excused himself and limped away towards the camping area, sad looking and without the tickets.",

        "text": "**Prologue:** I am formerly IT, currently an accountant/administrative assistant/IT/gopher/any other hat the owner can give me. Names and exact numbers have been changed to protect the guilty.\n\nOur story begins with a lad only a month and a half into his career in a new firm with a new set of managers and zero idea of what he's signed up for.\n\nThe Players:\n\n* T: Me, Our Hero, Wearer of Many Hats\n* E: Eric, Owner, CEO, Frequents the Hat Store to get me more\n* M: Marsha, Manager, Destroyer of Hopes and Dreams\n\nIn this job, we work on large projects that sometimes require a loan. One of my preliminary responsibilities was completing and processing the paperwork for these loans.\n\nOn one project, I notice that the total due for the project is $25,750, but the credit limit on the loan is only $25,000. If the increase was sizable (about 10%+ of the original credit limit), the bank would have to re-run the credit application and we would need to have more forms signed to get the limit increased to cover the project. In this case, we're well under that amount, so I call up the bank and ask them to raise the limit to cover that additional $750.\n\nThe next day, Marsha pulls me into her office as I'm leaving for the day.\n\n&gt; M: T, did you call the bank to try to raise the credit limit on this customer?\n\n&gt; T: Yes ma'am, it was under the amount where more paperwork would be needed, and I did not want to run more paperwork than was necessary.\n\n&gt; M: Well, T, you didn't get a credit limit increase, you applied for a whole new loan.\n\nThis is a serious problem. That loan application will show up on the customer's credit history, and if the bank approves the loan then it would completely jack-up the customer's debt to equity ratio and destroy their credit score completely. I done fucked up.\n\n&gt; M: Don't worry about it, I'll take care of it. In the future, if you need to do a credit limit increase or make any changes to customer accounts, send it to me.\n\nI took a liberty because I wanted to do one less piece of paperwork and ended up screwing over a customer. Her stance is totally reasonable, and I leave for the day. Immediately upon getting in my car, I call the owner.\n\n&gt; T: Hey, E, it's T. I wanted to let you know that I screwed up...\n\nSee, if there's anything I have learned over my life, cover-your-ass (CYA) works two ways, either it isn't your fault and you've documented your innocence completely, or it is your fault and you document that you did everything in your power to resolve the issue as quickly as possible. So I called up the man who signs my paycheck and told him the whole story.\n\n&gt; E: I understand. Give me the bank information, I'll get the full story and make sure everything is straightened out.\n\nI don't sleep well that night.\n\nNext morning, E pulls me into his office first thing, I mentally add \"update résumé\" to my to-do list.\n\n&gt; E: T, you applied for a credit limit increase.\n\n&gt; T: Right, but I messed it up, so what do I need to do to fix it?\n\n&gt; E: No, you don't understand. You applied for a credit limit increase. That's the only change on that customer's account since it was approved back when we started the project.\n\n&gt; T: Wait, what?\n\n&gt; E: M lied. She made up that story to scare you.\n\nThis is the first time where I had directly encountered my manager lying to me. M decided that a month and a half was too short a time for my meteoric rise from a clerk doing filing work and building excel workbooks (another story) to a clerk doing data entry and filling out paperwork, so she began a campaign of deceit and sabotage against me.\n\n**To Be Continued...** [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/53bgzp/10_of_the_time_she_is_right_40_of_the_time_a/)",

        "text": "A comment on another Tale reminded me of this, and this got to be too long for a comment so here I go...\n\n&amp;nbsp; Formerly, there was a punch card system for the time clock at work.  This led to mistakes where people would grab a card with someone else's name on top and punch them out, then maybe notice it and punch themselves out, and some poor soul in accounting would have to sit down every two weeks and sort out the mess of cross-clocking on paper.  Also occasional \"clock me out when you leave\" shenanigans. Eventually the machine died and an electronic version went into use  Everyone is issued an RFID card with a matching PIN.  Either can be used to punch in/out, and most people punch this number in to a keypad four times a day.  \n\n&amp;nbsp; This had been in place for a couple of years. Literally thousands of times, I had punched this PIN into a keypad.  And one day I got the flu or some similar thing and went from feeling like halfass and being able to go to work, to feeling like complete ass and I couldn't hang out anymore, so I left.  When I got to the time clock, I couldn't punch out.  I knew there were four numbers to punch, but I couldn't remember what they were.  For the life of me I *literally couldn't even* those four numbers.  I knew the buttons had to be pressed, but there was a PEBKAC situation and the ability to push buttons was mysteriously missing.  After standing there contemplating my inability to push buttons for a minute, my addled mind logged out from be-at-work mode and into drive-home mode.  Shuffle to the car, somehow survive the drive thanks God, sleep it off.  \n\n&amp;nbsp; A fuzzy afternoon and night later I was back at work, raring to go, running at a solid 54% of full capacity.  I was feeling so much better that I could push the buttons on the timeclock again!  Buuuut the numbers were still missing.  Here comes a bit of genius: I still had the card.  After it was issued, I realized that 0/10 I was not going to have this 3mm thick credit card thing in my wallet so I had stuck it to the wall in my work area with double-sticky tape.  Leaving aside the potential for abuse of my time card, ^^we're ^^not ^^talking ^^about ^^that ^^right ^^now! it was a brilliant place to keep an important, imminently-lose-able item, and now it came to the rescue!  Without having to call IT buddy or HR or anyone to reset my PIN or whatever would be required, I went to my desk, found my card, swiped myself out, and \n\n&amp;nbsp; was promptly laughed at by the owner of the company, who mentioned it was a bit early to be clocking out.  He got another laugh when I told him I had literally forgotten my PIN the day before and had to use the card to clock in (which I did, by swiping again) this morning. After my brain got back to full health with the rest of me, I remembered the PIN.  Now it occurs to me to hope I put that card back up on the wall.",

        "text": "Today marked my two weeks in a temporary assistant position at this office doing data entry for B2B purchases.  It is a lot of mindless, repetitive work squinting over arcane PO lists buying several million dollars worth of products for three regional warehouses daily.  I am the third person to cover the desk of a 50-something single mother having a dysfunctional breakdown with her 10 year old daughter and estranged ex-husband (who somehow managed to go on insurable disability leave for the past five months). \n\nThe office is essentially a gynocracy ruled by obese, middle-aged women with serious psychological issues.  It is a miserable, joyless place in the North American medical supply industry.  When I arrived two weeks ago, I was trained by a nineteen-year old girl who had been covering the desk for a month before being promoted to a proper purchasing job; and she only had a collection of scattered notes, scrawled in loopy handwriting, and multiple pages of bric-a-brac \"proceedure\" for entering orders (where one miniscule keystroke could result in a $250k mistake).  After half a day of her best instruction, I decided I was sufficiently capable to assume the post and jumped into the meat grinder.\n\nThe work station was a mess. Mountains of paper (I mean mountains) due to the company printing out records of electronic orders sent in triplicate (seriously) on 1980s printers. They even have someone on the other end of the country send the damn orders to their vendors to make sure. (Where are the Bobs when you need them? Fucking TPS reports...) A million Post-It Notes. Everywhere. On the computer screen. Account log ins. Corporate phone numbers. Shipping account numbers. Order proceedures for data entry. \n\nPaper with different instructions taped to the computer monitor; dozens of pages of random information pinned to the cubicle walls; a map of the United States (in case you forgot that North Dakota was west of Ohio, but east of Montana... seriously); photos of the dysfunctional child (who is the problem... right... if you believe that I have a bridge to sell you); and junk nick knacks everywhere.\n\nYesterday I started losing it. The amount of garbage surrounding me was enough to make anyone go insane, and I decided to just start cleaning the desk as I worked.  I crushed through the orders (I have been putting in 50+ hours a week with few breaks, it's a ball buster); I started recycling papers; and I started ripping post-it notes down and tossing them out everywhere. (There are only two other young men, an old accountant, and an executive who spends most of his time flying around the country as the men in the office -- the rest are in the warehouse with a group of even nastier, mentally-disturbed women). One of the other guys looked at me with wonder as I flippantly cleaned house. Photos and junk were put delicately put in a box (\"I do not want to damage her child's art work and personal property\" was my official line), 100lbs of pounds of paper were recycled, and mountains of dust with notes and dates from four years ago exposed and swept away from counter tops, etc.  The desk and cubicle is now a shrine to minimalist efficiency; order had conquered chaos.\n\nI came in this morning bringing a baseball to fool around with when I checked corporate e-mails (I am responsible for several hundred a day), phone calls, etc. Smug, I know. Now the old lady who is stationed next to this woman was in a foul mood -- she was not happy with my sweeping changes.  I had her shouting at me about some random \"new procedure\" (she's not my boss), and the fact that I completely eradicated the OCD hoarder mountain of her disturbed (\"former\"/still technically current) co-worker had her up in arms.  What was the result, you might wonder?\n\nAside from the Miltonesque hostility of this old bat (I hope she does not burn the building down), I got a full e-mail account, virtual screen log-in, etc. when I came in this morning. In other words, I am now a 'real' employee (I think they are looking for reasons to dismiss this obviously horrible employee with her history of chronic, fraudulent absenteeism). I am taking this clusterfuck mess of \"procedure\" instructions (I suppose data entry is a refuge for deranged people with OCD), and turning it into a clear instruction booklet which I can then pass on to whomever I train to hire to replace me. Because if a 19 year old girl straight out of high school can get promoted in a month, I have my eye on the sales desk, an territorial account, and a Porsche.  ;-)",

I thought it was odd as he'd sometimes be there for 12 hours or more - a few times he stayed all night and walked out when I did. This was especially strange to my mind as he was an hourly employee rather than salary and I couldn't imagine management approving overtime. One night I walked up and introduced myself.\n\nThe first thing I noticed about $Clyde upon entering his work space was the disarray. I've seen messy desks, but have never seen the like of his before or since. Printouts of arcane scripting language references were pinned haphazardly to the walls, while handwritten code was scrawled across pages upon pages of ripped-out notebook paper covering nearly the entire surface of his desk. Indeed, there were also several page-devoid composition notebooks scattered randomly across the area. What little horizontal space remained on both the desk and the floor was covered in candy wrappers, soda bottles, and plastic bags. The entire sight offended the senses, especially to someone such as me with OCD-like tendencies and a habit of keeping my desk as organized as humanly possible. Nevertheless, I set my coffee cup down on the desk next to his own, shook his hand, and we began to talk.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#The Hygiene\n\nA few minutes of small talk later, I picked up my coffee cup and was about about to take a sip when I realized I'd picked up his coffee by mistake. As I set his cup down to pick up my own, I noticed that the coffee inside was a slightly different color and texture than mine. That, my friends, was my first contact with The Cup.\n\nThe Cup sat on $Clyde's desk between his keyboard and monitor. At first glance, The Cup appeared to be a normal disposable coffee cup - plain, white, and made of Styrofoam, with small brown stains on the outside and on the desk surrounding. I assumed that, like most of us, $Clyde overdosed on coffee to get himself through the wee hours of the morning, but my first accidental glance inside The Cup brought tears to my eyes, bile to my throat, and instant regret to the forefront of my brain. For The Cup that I had almost sipped from was not being used as a coffee cup at all, but rather as a spittoon - a receptacle for $Clyde's chewing tobacco as it lost its flavor.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNow, let me be the first to chastise myself. *\"Chewing tobacco isn't nearly as bad as other possible habits!\"* I hear you cry. That is correct; many other habits would have been much worse, including but not limited to:\n\n* Moving your monitors to the floor in order to sleep on your desk\n* Eating food so gluttonously and messily that when you were let go they had to throw away your keyboard, your mouse, *and* your monitor\n* Using your desk phone to work at your second job as a phone sex operator\n* Screaming obscenities at customers over the phone at regular intervals\n* Falling asleep in your car on the way to work, driving off the side of the road, and somehow managing to **not** die...*5 times over the course of two weeks*\n\nNo, $Clyde's habit was none of the above. However, chewing tobacco is close to unheard-of in that part of the country, and this was my first exposure to the stuff. If I'd been introduced to it in a different setting, things would have been different. Unfortunately, from that point forward it was forevermore burned into my brain as a disgusting habit for a few simple reasons:\n\n* He filled perhaps 2 cups per night on average, which, although it may not have technically constituted a misdemeanor, almost certainly should have\n* $Clyde liked to pick at the Styrofoam cup and break pieces off the top, slowly whittling it down until the topmost edge was hovering just above the mass of chewed tobacco, exposing it for all to see\n* While $Clyde was talking, he would constantly reach over, bring the cup to his lips, and dribble tobacco juice into it. He would often pick up my coffee cup by mistake and use it before I could say anything\n* I had nearly sipped from a container of partially-digested tobacco\n\nNeedless to say, from that night on I was very, very careful to keep my own coffee cup in view and close to me at all times.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#The Rockstar\n\n$Clyde kept to himself most of the time and focused on his work to the exclusion of all else. We later became friends and sadly I think I was the only person he had really opened up to in years. His personality was...odd. He was eccentric to the extreme and often seemed a bit out of it, like he thought he might be lost but vaguely recognized the street signs and so was determined to keep going until he figured out precisely where he was. His true passion, however, was coding. He would go into a sort of trance while coding where he would lose track of time and forget to move from his desk for basic biological functions like bathroom breaks, food, and coffee. This was the cause of the late nights, the unapproved (and likely unpaid) overtime.\n\n$Clyde and I each discovered our respective loves of programming at roughly the same time. While we were both self-taught, the similarities ended there. I started small and worked my way up to bigger and more complex things, but he had a slightly more...*cavalier* attitude. While I would sit down and figure out what exactly I needed to do before I started a big project, he liked to jump right in and get his hands dirty. Unfortunately, while he certainly had the motivation and the determination to do big things, I quickly realized that his grasp of programming basics and best practices was a tad underwhelming. I'm afraid that I must mix a metaphor here, because it is the only way to accurately convey my confusion and utter bafflement at most of his work: *his incomplete grasp of programming basics was a stumbling block being pulled out from beneath his feet*. I tried my best, but alas I was too inexperienced to shake his firm belief that the way he knew how to do it was the best way. Below are some of my fondest memories of my time working with him:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; *This looks so cool!*\n\n$Clyde liked old-school terminals. Specifically, he liked the way they *looked*; he'd never actually used one. He was also one of the rare breed who, for some reason, used Notepad to write his scripts instead of an IDE. He was *ecstatic* when I introduced him to [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), because he could now use a theme with bold, neon green Courier New on a black background with a blinking underscore for a cursor. He said it made him feel like a hacker.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; *I'll just compile it!*\n\nOne of the first projects $Clyde worked on was a custom password manager. Never mind the fact that there are literally dozens of them already out there, he wanted to build his own. And then use it. With his usernames and passwords hard-coded into the program. Stored in a plaintext .ahk file on his decrypted-and-reimaged-with-a-bootleg-Windows-7-Home-Edition, I-take-this-across-the-country-when-I-travel-so-I-can-work-in-the-hotel, work-issued laptop. When I pointed out the fact that this plan was riddled with security holes big enough to drive a truck through, his solution was to compile the program, then delete the source code so nobody could steal all of his usernames and passwords.\n\n$Clyde had never heard of a decompiler.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; *Doing it the right way*\n\n$Clyde felt that doing normal AD work was complicated and boring, so he decided to automate all his tasks. To achieve this end, he started building a **master program**. Of course, as highly-trained, professional AD admins, he and I both had full access to a fully-loaded, top-of-the-line development environment in which to test our scripts.\n\n**HAH!**\n\nNone of the other admins had ever touched a command prompt, let alone scripted anything - so there were no provisions for dev environments and we were on our own. My solution was to request a workstation that I eventually turned into an isolated mock AD environment using ESXi. His solution, of course, was to put his scripts on client servers so he could test in production. One night, one of his batch-user-creation scripts went haywire and deleted about *half of the client's AD accounts*, forcing them to restore from the previous week's backup.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; *The syntax is easier*\n\n$Clyde and I had our differences (I liked to use IDEs, he...didn't), but perhaps one of the biggest was our disagreement about [AutoHotKey](https://autohotkey.com/) vs. [AutoIt](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/). We both started out using AHK, but I eventually migrated to AutoIt after struggling with AHK syntax. Once I did so, I discovered the wonderful world of easy-to-find, comprehensive User Defined Functions and much more intuitive syntax. $Clyde, however, refused to even try it, insisting that he was happy with AHK and that he knew how to use it. At the time, I thought nothing of it, but in time I discovered exactly why he refused to use AutoIt - which brings me to our next quote...\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; *I don't see the point of [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)*\n\nThe above is a direct quote from $Clyde. By this point we had both been working on our own scripts long enough to catch the attention of management, who asked us to work together on a larger, more comprehensive project. To be more specific, our manager gave the project to $Clyde, then a few weeks later surprised us both with the news that I would be helping out. This was a little-discussed head-nod from my manager to me that he needed someone trustworthy to keep an eye on $Clyde and how exactly he went about completing the project.\n\nAnd boy, did that project need looking after. When I came on the scene, Clyde had a couple thousand lines of code spread across dozens of files scattered amongst a dozen folders with names like **New Project 1**, **New Project 1 New**, **New Project 1 - Copy**, **New Project - Real**, and my personal favorite, **New Project - Copy - FINAL** - which was actually the repository for the newest versions of only 5 or so files; the bulk of the latest versions of the project files were housed in **New Project 1 New**.\n\nApparently, $Clyde had started out coding this project in AHK, but partway in had discovered the wonders of Powershell and had just begun to rewrite the whole thing. After getting over my initial shock at his plan to create a client-side application as a compiled Powershell script, I saw this as an opportunity to introduce some actual source control, project file backups, code structure, and all-around organization.  The quote above was his reaction to my suggestion that we structure the code into custom [modules](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd878324\\(v=vs.85\\).aspx) to increase code reusability and maintainability.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#The Aftermath\n\nI tried my damnedest, but was never able to salvage that project or change his Lone Ranger tendencies. A few months later, I accepted another offer and left. I always do my best to stay on good terms with management, so I found out a few months later that he had been unceremoniously let go after, rumor has it, An Incident involving prescription medication. To my knowledge, his scripts are still out there, squirreled away on client servers, waiting desperately for someone to run them...\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*TL:DR: Cowboy Coder Chews Chaw; Clings to Custom Coding Clients and Compilers; Copies Code Crazily; Contrives to Completely Change Client Conclusions; Confines Changed to Cooler Climes.

This is also written from his POV..\n\nI work in a warehouse for a large transport company in the UK where we get goods from companies to hold for them until they need them transporting elsewhere. I manage two warehouses and have up to 10 deliveries each day. \n\nEvery Thursday, the same driver delivers for his company. He is Turkish and doesn't understand much English but every time I see him, we have a mutual understanding that our relationship is good as it is and there is no need to complicate things by trying to hold conversations and getting nowhere. I've been seeing the same guy every Thursday for about 3 months and we are comfortable with how things are.\n\nToday, as I was working he came to me and tried to speak to me and, as I was really busy, just kept saying 'yeah' or 'yes mate' which seemed to really please him so I thought nothing of it. After 25 minutes of him saying something along the lines of 'davii' (think that's what it was)and 'you good English man', he pulled out his phone and showed me a picture of his wife. After that he put his arm around my shoulder and said 'you, her, yes?' and I finally got what he was saying. He was basically trying to marry me off to his daughter. I told him no and politely said I already had a missus. And he said, in a way I can only describe as a 'teacher voice' that 'you have two now yes?' I quickly said no, one is enough for me and ran into the back room. If I hadn't realised what he was telling me, I could have been going to work tomorrow and finding him, with his daughter in a wedding dress waiting for me. \n\nThis is why communication is a workers best friend. Poor communication could lead to surprise wedding to a woman you've never met.

        "text": "For the last week and a half, I've been working on revising a production record for my company. I had to do a complete overhaul of the thing. It changed so much that the track changes function in Word literally marked the entire document in red.\n\nAfter getting it all formatted so that it looked nice and contained the FDA recommended documentation, my supervisor, the manufacturing VP, and my department manager reviewed it, and all of them said it was good. After that, the document was sent to Quality to get approved.\n\nSo that's it, right?\n\nWrong.\n\nAt 16:45, I was enjoying the end of a day well spent and fairly productive. I had finished everything I was supposed to, and everything that might have needed additional work was being reviewed by Quality. As I sat in my office chair, chatting with my supervisor about our work for the following day, I was contemplating my work out for the night. My car was in the shop, and I had approval to leave early since all my work was finished to catch the free shuttle service.\n\nOh what a lovely day I was having.\n\n&gt; \"JBH! JBH!\"\n\n&gt; $me (*internally*): Oh sweet Jesus, no.\n\nMy department manager came to me to say that she wanted an additional section in the production record. She wanted it in there before, but didn't realize it was *already sent to QA despite her signing off on it*.\n\nShe simply said \"just add the DMSO  solubility test to it. You know how.\"\n\nActually I didn't. I have done similar solubility tests, but before I could ask her to specify what kind of test she wanted, she wandered off.\n\nMy shuttle was coming by in about 30 minutes, and she was forcing me to figure out through her vague words what exactly she wanted. My supervisor suggested that since the solubility steps require a proportional calculation, that I work backwards from there.\n\nThat would have worked, except the steps in the production record are based on pooling multiple molecules together, and the test had to be based on individual molecules.\n\nAfter determining that the test would be done with 5mg samples, I worked out from the production record concentrations for the final pooling that 2 mL of DMSO was the most optimal for the test.\n\nAs I started to insert that into the production record, she came back and asked me why I wasn't using the proper solvent for the test.\n\nWHAT?!\n\nShe didn't even tell me what the proper solvent was, and just said DMSO.\n\nTurns out the test is supposed to use a scaled down version of the final solvent solution in the production record. It's actually only 10% DMSO.\n\nDo I scrambled to start working on a procedure for that, when she brings me a sheet of paper… with the freaking instructions for the entire solubility test on it.\n\n&gt; \"I made this a while ago. You can use it.\"\n\nI wanted to scream. She had all the information I needed, and didn't think to give it me.\n\nNot only that, the document was typed and in the format of a typical production record instruction list.\n\nShe wanted me to simply type it up again because it was *formatted and ready to put in the Word document.*\n\nThe time was 17:05.\n\nShe couldn't be bothered to share this with me until after a) she signed off on the final version of the production record, b) I had been scrambling to determine how to write it for the last 20 minutes, c) I was about to leave for the day, d) she had been sitting on this for a week and a half, and e) Quality had left for the day, so they couldn't immediately sign off on it like she thought they would.\n\nShe then said that the quality manager told her not to worry about the test! It's separate from the actual production and simply needs to be done in either a notebook or its own form! So my work practically wasn't needed at all!\n\nI tried not screaming at her after that, but my cooler side prevailed, and I simply cleaned up my desk, and told her I was heading home.\n\nI ended up missing the free shuttle… and I ended up waiting 20 minutes for a bus that never showed despite three being scheduled in the time I waited… and the Uber to the train station ended up costing more than what I make in an hour.\n\nFuck. Me.\n\nTL;DR - Proper information flow and prioritizing? Ain't nobody got time for that!",

        "text": "So, I was training some new lifeguards today. There were two in the class of four that I knew, as they're long term friends of mine. We'll say their names are Callie and Alex. Their final test to get their lifeguard certification was today, and one of the things you need to do for that is to complete a water rescue scenario. I was chosen to be the \"victim\" when Alex was taking her test (and Callie was helping her with the backboard) by the other girls, and I felt so bad. To put into perspective why, Alex is maybe like 5'4\", so I'm like twice her size, in terms of weight. So the other guards and I fool around, waiting for the right moment to fake my drowning, and when the time comes, I do the thing I needed to do. Now, my boss told me that the scenario for Alex would be a deep-water drowning, and to be what's called an \"active\" drowner while she's approaching, and to go \"passive\" when she reaches me. Right before I dip under the water to go passive, I whisper to Alex \"I'm sorry.\"\n\nSo after that, she's dragging me to the wall. She gives my hands up to Callie so they can use the backboard to remove me from the water, because if you're passive, you're unconscious and can't remove yourself. You know how lifeguard tubes have the little strap that goes across the guard's chest? That ended up getting wedged in between my left arm and head while Callie was holding my hands so Alex could get the backboard. (For reference, when removing someone from the water via backboard, you have to have them facing the wall, then have their right hand in the left hand of the guard that's holding them while the backboard is being brought out, and vice versa.) So she had to untangle that, which took her like a minute. that doesn't sound like a lot, but you only have three minutes for the test. And then I felt terrible because they had such a hard time pulling me out of the water because I'm so heavy in comparison to them.\n\nPulling people of all sizes out of the water is a needed skill for all guards, but I just felt really bad, considering these were my friends and I'm so much bigger than them.",

        "text": "I'm an Intern with (*INSERT NONDISCLOSABLE STATE CONSERVATION DEPARTMENT HERE*), in the State Park system. Normally when you visit a state or national park, people assume that all the rangers fall under the same job requirements. We don't. Rangers come in different specializations, which may fall under different government divisions entirely. For instance, park naturalists may be under the conservation department while other rangers fall under police supervision. My Bosses (I have 4) and I are educators. Other groups do maintenance, police-like work, invasive species removal, lifeguards (beaches are the main draw here), public dock management, or help-desk work. \n\nNow, we were on our way to teaching some middle schoolers about the end of the ice age (and the related large mammals and native cultures of the time) when we got a call about a goose that had been hit by a car. This happens all the time, and the responsibility goes to whoever is closest rather than whoever is most trained. It was dead by the time we got there, so we put it in a bag and headed to the gated maintenance area to the official disposal place at the maintenance shed. \n\nWe arrive to a guy in an SUV waiting to get out through the main gate. We don't recognize him at all, and he's not wearing any official uniform. Naturally, a conversation was in order. \n\n&gt; Us: Who are you?\n\nHim: I'm from (*UNDISCLOSBLE CITY ABOUT 1hr AWAY*), I'm just here for the weekend. \n\n&gt; How did you get in here?\n\nThe rangers let me in. \n\nHis quick, confident answers assured us that he at least wasn't making this story up on the spot, and there was a party of similar-looking people at a picnic shelter nearby. Being educators, we didn't really have any specific training for these scenarios, but everything seemed fine. He was probably let in to dump something in the same dumpster we were going to. We opened the gate, finished our business there, and went about our day. \n\nWe come back later to put some supplies back in the maintenance shed in the compound. We were met by the Ranger 1 (official radio codename for the police-ranger in charge of the radio system), who informed us of a call they had gotten earlier from the regular police, who said they had gotten a call from homeland security, who had gotten a call from the border patrol (Bureaucracy in Action, I guess). Border Patrol had tracked an illegal alien into the park, had found his SUV, and had impounded it in our maintenance area to force him to show himself eventually. \n\nHe did. When we let him drive it out. \n\nI'm not giving any information out as to where this was, as I don't really want the government being angry at me. My 2nd Boss spent all this past afternoon creating a very long email about how little communication there is between departments, how little training they were offered, and how little they could have done in that situation anyway for when Homeland Security eventually calls.

We received 85 applications for a minimum wage or apprentice wage position, and I'd soon whittled that down to 10 due to mainly crappy CVs.\n\nExample CV:\n\n    **CV for John Smith**\n    \n    Address: Next village over\n    \n    john.smith@email-address.com - 07123 456 789\n    \n    **Work Experience**\n    \n    Non\n    \n    **Education**\n    \n    GCSE\n    \n    Local School name 2011 to 2016\n\n\nNo mention of courses, no other information.  From this CV, they expected to get an interview for a job.  Sorry, but no.\n\nSo out of the ten people I contacted for interview, six responded and confirmed an appointment.  Out of the first three appointments, only one showed.\n\nBut then we learn that the company has a rule that states all internal candidates must be interviewed.  Yesterday afternoon, my interviewee was a 19 yr old girl who was working on the factory floor.  She applied, and strangely met the basic criteria of *Basic IT Knowledge*.  Let's call her Jade, and my fellow interviewee let's call Rob.\n\n&gt;Me: Ok Jade, this is an informal interview just to get the background information and to see if you'll be a good fit into the team.  We'll start by asking you to tell us a little about yourself.\n\nBear in mind that I know this girls name, age and which part of the factory she is currently working in.\n\n&gt;Jade: I'm Jade, I'm nineteen and I'm currently working in the finishing factory on packaging.\n\nI knew all of that.\n\n&gt;Rob: Outside of work, what do you like doing?\n\nHer CV mentions socializing in the pub, and watching television.  If that was on my CV, I'd at least attempt to spin it so that it was a little more glamorous or that it aided my relaxation after a stressful day at work.\n\n&gt;Jade: I enjoy going to the pub with my boyfriend, or staying at home and watching tv.\n\nOMG this is getting painful.  She mentioned her boyfriend.  She's 19, I'm 43 and Rob is 39.  Neither of us are going to even contemplate asking her out especially as he's married and I've just got myself a girlfriend who's 41.\n\n&gt;Me: Obviously this role is a trainee role so training will be given, but we need someone who can at least find their way around a computer to start with.  Your CV mentions an IT course at school.  What did that cover?\n\n&gt;Jade: We used office.  Word and excel, presentations.\n\n&gt;Me: Any database work or programming?\n\nShe looked directly at me and smiled.\n\n&gt;Jade: No.  I'm willing to learn though.\n\nLong story short, she came across as something of an \"airhead\".\n\nLater that day, one of the other factory staff who's working with Jade turned up in my office as one of the conveyors was playing up.  I took that opportunity to ask her what she thought of Jade.\n\nHer response:  Oh, Jade's a bit of an airhead and to be honest, probably won't last past her probationary period.  It's taking a lot to train her on the basics.\n\nOnly two more to interview, if they turn up.",

Husband is singing my praises to his clients and to his colleagues but Wife is still hostile. Some days she wouldn't come in the office at all. Some days I'd get angry texts after work asking if something had been adjusted in a file. I have no access to files from home and can't help. Husband tells me that Wife has problem with the way I take messages. Wife tells me I delayed a closing on a file because I sent two e-mails instead of texting. Wife tells me that I need to tell her when people come into the office even though those people call her as they leave. I feel like I can't win.\n\nFriday rolls around. I'm alone again but Husband is sending me tasks and I'm keeping very busy. \n\nWife comes to work around 3:00 and tells me to go home and enjoy my Friday while she cleaned the office. I volunteer to stay and help but she tells me to have a great weekend and take off. \n\nI run some errands and get home around 4:00. I try to log in to my work e-mail to confirm an appointment and the password had been reset. Weird.\n\nThen I get an automatic e-mail from Facebook (on my personal account) saying my admin privileges for the company page had been revoked. I text Husband. I text Wife. I call Husband. Nothing. I look on Facebook and see I've been blocked by their personal pages.\n\n\"I think I just got fired,\" I text my wife.\n\nNothing all day Friday. Nothing all day Saturday. I'm sick to my stomach. I can't sleep or eat. \n\nSunday rolls around and I write them a letter. I make my wife proofread it and edit out anything even remotely accusatory. I say, \"I can't get ahold of either of you but I take it I'm no longer welcome at Wolf Realty based on your actions. Would you like my keys?\"\n\nHusband writes back: \"We are deeply saddened to hear about this. If this is a letter of resignation, we accept. Was that your intent? Your position at Wolf Realty has not changed whatsoever. If we were going to fire you, we would have had a meeting with you and asked for your keys.\"\n\nI tell my friend who studies law. \"Do NOT resign,\" she tells me. I comply.\n\nI write, \"No sir, this is not a resignation letter. It is a reaction to having my work privileges revoked. It seems as if you are letting me go.\"\n\nHe writes: \"You are NOT fired. We would have had a meeting with you.\"\n\nMonday morning rolls around.\n\n\"OP, take a seat. Unfortunately we need to fire you for unsatisfactory work performance. Sign here and take a moment to collect your things.\" Wife is in a very good mood. \n\nI'm given a final check which accounts for one week of work and only one of the two weeks of vacation I was owed. I was less than a month away from cashing in both weeks to go on a trip with my wife. \n\n\nShortly after, I get a notification from Microsoft saying my account has been compromised. I had used my Microsoft Office code on their new computer to get them up and running. It had my personal e-mail on it but Wife had tried to add herself as an alternate e-mail and change my security info. It was unbelievably satisfying to change the password and deauthorize that computer.\n\nThat was two weeks ago. \n\nTL;DR: Husband and wife team didn't respond well to conflict. ",

        "text": "**STORY 2: BAI TEA**\n\nIf you guys haven't tried Bai5 drinks, you should. They're a stevia tea drink with ten calories. I bought them by the box and brought them to work because they are delicious and have as much caffeine as coffee.\n\nThis husband and wife team have five kids between them, all from previous marriages. They were sweet kids and I spent a lot of time around them. One day their youngest, a girl around 12, grabs one of my Bai drinks from the fridge and starts chugging away.\n\n\"These are delicious!\" she tells her brothers. Her mom is working around the corner. I don't want to tell a 12 year old girl that she took something from me but I also don't want 5 kids thinking those are fair game if I'm special ordering boxes from Amazon on my dime. She finishes the drink. It's unclear if Wife, who was busy going through a filing cabinet, had noticed. \n\nThey leave. I quietly text my wife and ask her opinion of the situation. She suggests sending Wife a link for the drinks. That seems passive aggressive so I suck it up and have the following weird conversation:\n\n\"Hey Wife, this is a little awkward to bring up...but one of your kids drank one of those Bais.\"\n\n\"...and?\" she replies.\n\n\"...well, I brought those in. I have them with my lunch.\"\n\nI expect her to look embarrassed. She looks pissed.\n\n\"Well how much are they?\" she asks.\n\n\"Oh, it's not a big deal!\" I say. \"She probably thought you guys stocked the fridge with them.\"\n\n\"Well I'll buy you a box. How much are they?\" \n\n\"That's very nice but it's not necessary, I promise. I feel awkward even bringing it up.\"\n\n\"How much is a box?!\" she asks, growing impatient. \n\nI tell her I don't know. I tell her it was an innocent misunderstanding and I wasn't asking to be reimbursed. I tell her I'm not accusing anyone of anything. I say sorry. I'm apologizing for her kids taking my stuff. \n\nShe goes into Husband's office. Closes the door. They *never* close the door. After 30 minutes she comes out, goes straight into her office, and closes her door. Silent treatment from both again for the rest of the day.\n\nThe next day, more of the same. Total silence from both. At 5:28 (notice a theme?), I'm called into Husband's office. He hands me a check.\n\n\"This should make up for any personal items we've taken from you.\" It's a check for $50. \n\n\"I can't accept this, this is way too much.\"\n\n\"Take it,\" he insists.\n\n\"No really, this is not an appropriate amount. I'm happy to share my stuff and would've let your daughter try one of those drinks. I just didn't think she knew they were mine. It's an honest mistake.\"\n\n\"Take the damn check!\" he shouts. \n\nI leave it on the desk and tell him to have a nice day. \n\nThey tried to hand me that check for weeks. I eventually wrote \"void\" on the last one and told them I wouldn't take a $50 check to reimburse me for a $2 drink. Wife never spoke to me the same.\n\nStory #1 for context: https://redd.it/4v6zfl\n\nStory #3 for the firing: https://redd.it/4v736b\n\n*edited for grammar",

        "text": "\"I think I just got fired.\" \n\n\"What do you mean 'you think' you got fired?\" asked my wife, obviously concerned.\n\n\"I don't know. They won't talk to me.\"\n\nI worked at a real estate office that we'll call Wolf Realty for the sake of this story. Wolf Realty was established by a husband and wife team a few years ago and they had just saved enough money to rent an office and hire an assistant. The job was $35,000 a year with two weeks of vacation and no benefits, but I thought it would be a good stepping stone job and give me a great opportunity to learn about the industry. \n\nBut nothing is what it seems when you work with weirdos.\n\n**STORY 1: THE PERFORMANCE REVIEW**\n\nI dove into the gig head first. I asked a lot of questions, laughed at bad jokes, dressed very professionally (even though I worked in their dining room for the first two months), and constantly pushed myself. We sat across from each other 40 hours a week and I was a guest in their home. Needless to say I was on my best behavior and eager to please. \n\nFast forward two months and we're finally moving into a new office. I set up the computers, I assembled and moved furniture, I cleaned the whole place, I stayed on top of my paperwork, I stayed late multiple days, and I planned the Grand Opening gala. Everyone was in high spirits and excited.\n\nFriday rolls around. At 5:20, ten minutes before the end of my shift and the end of a long week, I'm called in for a performance review. \n\nHe leads with, \"I like you. You're a very capable young man. But I don't think you want to be here.\"\n\nI'm stunned. He continues, \"Wife and I have noticed some negative energy from you. Perhaps you should take up meditating, reading self-help books, or prayer to help you focus. Furthermore, we're not sure about your work.\"\n\n\"My work?\" I manage to get out.\n\n\"You always do the tasks we assign you and do them well. But I don't really see you pushing yourself. And that's important in this business.\"\n\nI'm a grown man fighting tears. I ask for examples. He can't cite any. \n\n\"I'd really like to know why you both feel this way,\" I say. \"I'm very happy here. If there's anything I said or did to make you feel this way I'd like the chance to address it.\" I'm wracking my brain. I had a migraine one day, did I seem grumpy? I had a fight with my wife one day, did I seem distracted? No examples.\n\nI reluctantly tell my wife that I got a bad performance review and I'm not sure why. She encourages me to e-mail them and politely ask for clarification so I know what to improve. So I write a very nice e-mail saying I was disappointed if my job performance wasn't at the level I thought it was. I ask for specific examples of times I didn't seem interested in the business or seemed negative in any way. I mention how hard I had worked that week setting up the office and still maintaining my daily duties. I reiterate how happy I am to be in the industry and working with a family-run company.\n\nNo response. Keep in mind, real estate agents are glued to their phones and e-mails, even on weekends. \n\nMonday rolls around. They are both giving me the silent treatment. I try to initiate a conversation, ask them about their weekend, ask work questions...nothing from them.\n\nAt 5:28 that day, I'm called into the office. This time, I'm given a three page single-spaced document called \"Wolf Realty Culture.\" He has clearly worked on it for hours. There are 18 points about what it means to be a member of the Wolf team. One point was \"we do not brag about our accomplishments.\" No mention of my e-mail, no answers to my questions. I am deeply unsatisfied by this gesture but he asks me to put everything behind me. I put on a smile and agree. If only it ended there.\n\nStory #2: https://redd.it/4v719m\n\nStory #3: https://redd.it/4v736b",

        "text": "A few years ago I was working the front desk at a gym when I encountered the nastiest customer I've had in all my years of customer service.\n\nI was the morning receptionist, which meant I got there at 4:45 AM to get the gym ready for the day and open at 5. I was usually the only staff member working for at least an hour, maybe longer. It depends when the personal trainers had their appointments scheduled. Now the gym had a policy that the front desk was never to be left unattended, as there wasn't a gate or anything to stop people just walking in. If I wanted to go to the bathroom or anything, I had to find someone to cover the desk and scan members in.\n\nSo I had this woman who came in right at opening every morning. She'd occasionally show up at 4:55, yank on the doors, and throw her arms up at me. I of course never opened the doors until 5 on the dot. One day, after she had been in, she phoned around 6 or 6:30. I'll call her S for sunshine, since she's such a morning person.\n\n&gt;S: Hi, I think I forgot my iPod in one of the machines.  \n&gt;Me: Okay, do you know what machine or where in the building?  \n&gt;S: In the ladies only section.\n\nThis building is massive for a gym. It used to be a grocery store. The cardio section is right in front of the desk, so I could easily have sprinted over to get it if it were there without breaking eyesight with the desk, but the ladies only section is on the second level, up a staircase and around a corner, totally hidden from view.\n\n&gt;Me: I can't leave the desk unattended and go up there right now because I'm the only one working, but I promise as soon as another staff member gets in I'll send them to have a look.  \n&gt;S: You won't look now?  \n&gt;Me: I'm really sorry, but I can't leave the desk unattended, I could get in a lot of trouble for that. But someone should be in soon and I'll make sure they go look right away.  \n&gt;S: I'm *so glad* I pay *so much* for this gym membership where the staff are *so helpful*.\n\nAnd she hangs up. Less than five minutes later, one of the trainers came in, and I asked her to have a look for the iPod. She found it no problem. Around 9:30 that morning, S came storming in while I was on the phone, snatched the iPod off the desk where it was sitting in front of me, and stormed back out without a word. After I got off the phone, my manager (whose desk isn't far from mine) asked me what happened so I explained the whole thing. He was a real stickler for rules and policies so he agreed I'd done the right thing.\n\nNext morning, S came back in first thing when we opened with her attitude in full swing. She practically flung her membership card at me, and I scanned it and told her to have a good workout.\n\n&gt;S: Are you giving me attitude?  \n&gt;Me: No, I'm really not. I told you to have a good workout. I say that to just about everyone.  \n&gt;S (holding her iPod): You're lucky this was found. I'm sick of your attitude. You see me out there waiting every morning and you never unlock the door for me. I want to talk to your manager.  \n&gt; Me: No problem. He'll be in around 9. His name is Bossname, and his desk is right there. He'll be happy to discuss our policies with you.\n\nI've found that openly offering people information on how to talk to the manager always takes the wind out of their sails, because they realize you've got nothing to hide. Needless to say, she never did contact him. I, however, filled him in on the way she talked to me, and he took her comment about me being lucky her iPod was found as harassment against me. She got a nice phone call from head office explaining they'd be happy to take away her membership if she didn't learn to talk to staff more nicely. She never gave me any attitude after that.\n\nI never understood the people who show up before the gym is open with a shitty attitude. Hit the snooze button. You clearly need the sleep.",

The worst part is people would rather quit than say anything because they're scared she'll find out about it.\n\nEvery new employee we get cries or almost cried because of her on their first day. However, we're all a bunch of dedicated people, so nobody quits.\n\nBasically what she does, is takes a normal, passive everyday comment, and turns it into an attack on her even if it has nothing to do with her. I feel that the reason she does this is because she might be racist. She never overreacts to things her black employees say. \n\nExamples include: me assuring her that I didn't steal from the register on my first day because I was short. She took it as an accusation towards her even though she had zero reason to think so.\n\nOur new employee not knowing what to do on her first day. To which she said: \"what did you do at your last job? Nothing?\"\n\nMe telling her that we might need to put up a reserved sign, for a woman who wanted to have a birthday party there. She wanted to have it Sunday afternoon, which is a VERY busy time. I knew if we didn't reserve something for them, they wouldn't have anywhere to sit. She took this as a challenge against her *authoritah* and was sure to put me in my place in front of the customer. \"Excuse me, are you the manager?\". Even though it was just a suggestion. I don't need to be the manager to have a suggestion.\n\nShe demands respect but she treats everyone like she's an edgy teen with anger issues. Condescending, patronizing comments. Rolling her eyes at everyone. In fact she made a customer leave the other day because she saw her rolling her eyes at her.\n\nFinally, one of my other managers told me today that she was collecting written statements about the GM. Honestly, I won't be happy unless she's fired. She's not going to change, she's too stubborn. She's not a good manager. It would be hard to find someone as bad as she is to people.",

Did you receive it?\n\nMe: Yes, ma'am.\n\nLady: I didn't get a confirmation e-mail.\n\nMe: That's unusual. I sent one yesterday but maybe a system glitch happened. I'll go ahead and resend one. Is the correct email (redacted)?\n\nLady: Yes, that's correct. Maybe you think you sent it but you didn't? When did you send it?\n\nMe: According to my outbox, it was sent yesterday at 4:28PM.\n\nLady: Well, we faxed over the order on the 5th.\n\nMe: I apologise, we didn't receive it until yesterday. Your order will be shipped out tomorrow though.\n\nLady: Why are you holding it?\n\nMe: We are currently gathering the equipment. Your item was unavailable, and it has just became available today. Once we ship out your order, we will e-mail you the tracking information.\n\nLady: Why are you holding? Why didn't I get a confirmation e-mail? It'll be much easier if you give us a confirmation e-mail...\n\nAnd she kept repeating the same things over and over.\n\nFor five minutes straight.",

        "text": "So I used to work as a manager at a pizza place until I moved on to bigger and better things. This meant that I had many jobs rolled into one, including spending some time as a cashier at the front of the restaurant. Now, I have seen and heard a lot of crazy things in my day, but this story was probably the craziest.\n\nIn the early evening a couple in their forties came in and explained that they wanted to order, but they had some food credit that they would like to use. This wasn’t all that uncommon because when a complaint about a meal was filed with the call center and the customer didn’t want a remake for the food, sometimes credit was given for the restaurant’s mistake. But on this occasion they began to explain to me what happened.\n\n“They almost didn’t give me credit for it, but we tried warming up our pizza and it caught on fire,” she said.\n\nI stared, curious and a little concerned, “It caught on fire? What kind of pizza was it?”\n\n“Oh, just a normal meat pizza,” she said, at that point having her phone out, showing me pictures of the charred pizza.\n\n“It almost burned down our kitchen,” her husband chimed in, eager to share their story.\n\n“Oh wow. I don’t know of anything in a meat pizza that would make it do that,” I said. “How did you warm it up?”\n\n“Oh, you know. We just popped it on the box and put it in the oven.”\n\nI stared. Did she just say she put the cardboard box in the oven?\n\n“You warmed it up on the pizza box?”\n\n“Well yeah. We always do. Our daughter does it too and we’ve never had a problem before.”\n\nWow… It’s a miracle they’re still alive with common sense like that. Cardboard is flammable, folks!\n\n“Yeah, I would strongly suggest not doing that,” I said as I excused myself to make a call and check up on their food credit, saying a little prayer that this pizza wouldn’t be the one that finally did burn down their house.",

        "text": "Just to put things in perspective when I am annoyed in the workday, I think back on this:\n\nBack in the days when dinosaurs still walked the earth, my dad helped me get a summer-semester job in the steel mill where he worked. My dad was not management, just a really good worker, as had been his father in the same mill - this was just management being nice to someone who they thought was worth it. \n\nBut there was a caution given me – the rules were that there were no \"summer jobs,\" only permanent employment, so I had to give a non-answer if anyone asked whether I was intending to quit and go back to college. \n\nSome of the workers in the shop I was assigned thought I really did plan to drop out and start a career in the mill. They (particularly the ones who knew my father or remembered my grandfather) wanted to encourage me to go back to school. Others suspected that I had temporary work in mind and were annoyed that I was occupying a good, high paying union job that maybe one of their buddies could have gotten as permanent work. The common consensus of both was that I should get the nastiest, hardest work that could be found.\n\nThere are plenty of such jobs in a mill. The shop I was working in fixed railroad “trucks” (wheel assemblies), the large gears in the guts of giant cranes, and similar things that were huge, heavy, and dirty.\n\nMy days started at 8am with a sledgehammer. I had been a high school wrestler and was in pretty good shape, but I was not large (5’7” and 115 pounds), and a complete stranger to a sledge. They ascertained that I had no idea they came in sizes (6 pounds being considered “average”), and gave me my very own 18lb hammer. \n\nEach morning they had lined up for me about 5 hours of things that needed pounding, enough to last until the 30-minute lunch break. Recall, this is in Alabama, in August, in a steel mill. \n\nAt 1pm I started the harder, dirtier work.\n\nThe cab of a large crane in those days was sheet metal with some windows on the front and sides, unlike the mostly glass ones of today. The huge gears and pulleys were under the floor of the crane cab, and to get to them the floor of the cab was removed. The gears were coated in “gear shield”, a black grease about the consistency and color of soft tar. It had enough body to help prevent the gears from clashing and chipping, but the mechanics wanted it all cleaned off before they touched the gears. It was nasty, sticky stuff, and the tiniest bit that got on you stained your skin a deep mahogany color that was impossible to wash off.\n\nTo clean the gears you first put on a rain slicker (pants and coat) that had once been yellow, then take a generous glob of “white” (actually clear-ish) grease and slather the exposed skin on the back of your neck, ears, and your face except where protected by goggles. Heavy protective clothing covers everything else, including elbow length welder’s gloves on both hands. Meantime, the steam generator has been building pressure. This is a high-pressure tank of about 500 gallons of detergent water that is brought to a boil. You know it is ready when the pressure gauge is up and a small relief valve whistles with live steam. \n\nTake the steam wand (about 6 feet long) and climb in the cab, balancing on the greasy gears. The cabin is a little warm, since it’s a sheet metal box sitting in the Alabama sun at 1pm in August – maybe 130-140f. It gets a lot hotter when I open the steam valve and superheated steam and detergent water blasts out of the pressure washer wand. I now can see absolutely nothing - the vapor is too thick even to see my hands. I just spray the steam down to where I remember the nasty gears to be. Gear shield melts and flies in globs in all directions, but eventually finds its way out the bottom of the assembly. Every minute or so I shut off the steam and wait for the air to clear enough to see what remains to be done. \n\nAfter about ten minutes the steam pressure has dropped and it’s time for a break while another head of pressure builds up. Climb out, take off the slicker and go stand in a cold shower. You only get wet on the parts that don’t have the grease – the water just rolls off there. In five to ten minutes your core temp has dropped, the steam is back up, so have another go. Five or six rounds usually cleans a crane. They started me out on one-a-day, but after two weeks to acclimate and to confirm I was not going to unexpectedly pass out I was expected to do two. \n\nWhen finished, you remove the lithium grease that has kept the gear shield from getting to your skin using a rag soaked in mineral spirits. A soapy shower then takes off the mineral spirits before it irritates the skin too much. If you missed greasing a spot it will be dark brown for a week or two.\n\nAt one point I asked why not do the cranes in the morning before they got so blasted hot even without the steam; they pointed out that after doing a couple of cranes no one could be expected to swing a hammer, and both needed to get done. \n\nOn the plus side, I was amazingly buffed when I went back to school after three months of 5 hours a day with that hammer followed by three hours of super-sauna. \n\nTLDR: Nasty job I once had makes all my work today seem like a picnic.\n",

My job entails cleaning the suites in one wing of the hospital after clients and employees have left for the night. \n\nThis particular wing of the hospital is close to the maternity ward and the floors are numbered G, 1 and 2 instead of the usual 1, 2 and 3 which results in a lot of visitors ending up on the wrong floor. As a result, whenever I see someone who looks lost I'll stop whatever I'm doing and offer them assistance. One time, however, I got more than I bargained for.\n\nI saw this older guy, who I'll call OG, wandering around on floor 2. I figured he was looking for the maternity ward which was on floor 1 so I approached him and the following conversation ensues:\n\nMe: Excuse me sir, are you looking for the maternity ward?\n\nOG: No, I'm looking for the [medical] seminar.\n\nMe: I'm sorry sir, there isn't any seminars taking place on this floor. Maybe---\n\nOG: It's in Room 209! That's means it's on floor 2!\n\nMe: Yes sir but it must be in another wing of the hospital. There aren't any seminars going on here.\n\nOG: Are you sure? What's back there? \n\nMe: Sir, there are restrooms over there and only two doctors offices in this wing and they're both closed. I'm not sure where the seminar is but you can ask the receptionist on the ground floor.\n\nOG: *getting angry* I asked her and she said it's on this floor! \n\nMe: Sir, there are multiple wings in the hospital. It is probably on the second floor in another wing.\n\nOG: Well I'm going to go in there to see if it's there. *starts walking to a doctor's office which is closed*\n\nMe: Sir, you can't go in there! Sir! Sir, Stop!\n\nOG: *ignores me and goes into office despite there being a sign saying \"Closed\" and no lights on*\n\nI wait patiently as I watch him through the glass door as he fumbles around and then leaves.\n\nWhy can't people just listen?",

        "text": "I was in the spring and summer of 2015 working as a long-range tour guide in Romania.\n\nThe great parts about this are that Romania is a stunningly beautiful country, and the tourists are mostly always open-minded eldery western Europeans who just wanted \"something different\", since Romania is not much of a tourist destination.\n\nThe bad part about this is that the roads are pure horror, you can easily end up spending 5 hours on the road for a 150 km ride. On top of that, **HORRENDOUS PLANNING**. It will get complicated, but trust me, its worth the read.\n\nThe worst part about my case in particular is just really bad planning. Here's a summary of the tour that made me quit:\n\nWe'd start off in Bucharest, do a short city tour after airport extraction and head over to the mountains to a village near Kronstadt where we'd spend a few nights so we'd have the chance to visit **Dracula's Castle** among others. Hotel was fine, food was bland but OK, spirits were still up.\nThe castle, however, proved to be a problem.\n\nThe idea is that the people who ran things at the castle should have received a reservation from the planning department, giving me a discount when purchasing tickets with the advance that I received from the touring company. **They never sent out the advance and I ended up spending about 2 times as much money as I should have.**\n\nNow the company also instructed me to sell \"insurance\" on the bus. Romania's not an expensive country to visit, so the reasoning is that the tourists won't mind spending another 50€ for nothing, really. They knew very well what was going on but paid up anyhow. \nThis money was supposed to be put in the bank at the first chance I got, on the company's account. **I ended up using this money for the tickets, since their lack of making a reservation made me pay full price**\n\nThe moment they didn't receive the money an hour after arriving in Kronstadt, they  kept harassing me by phone about every 2 hours about the money. I ended up calling back in the evening from my hotel room and nearly losing my cool over them interrupting my work over **their fuck-up**.\n\nI couldn't afford the difference out of my own pocket, and even if I could, I wouldn't have paid them. \n\nEventually I got them off my back threatening to just take the train home and leave a bus full of tourists with a Romanian bus driver who didn't speak a lick of English. I wouldn't have done it, but you gotta threaten sometimes I suppose.\n\nWe continued on our long road to the North of Romania; its lovely monasteries and majestic Bucovina. It was at this point I announced the name of the hotel we'd be staying at, and some tourists informed me that their programs said otherwise. I checked and noticed that about half the tourists had downloaded and printed programs that differed from mine. I called the company and asked what the deal with this was; turns out **the program was updated and I was not informed**. I called the hotel from my own program and they did indeed not include us in their planning. They were full.\nI googled the name of the hotel I didn't know we'd be staying at and informed them of our arrival. **They weren't prepared either**\n\nWe arrived at the hotel, and there was a receptionist, and a cook. That's it. We were 38 tourists, a guide, and me.\n\nI gave the list of the names, and informed the receptionist about which tourists preferred ground-floor rooms because of their age. They didn't have any. They didn't have any elevators either. The driver and I ended up dragging about half of the eldery folk's luggage upstairs.\n\nNow one particularly vital (for her age, 80) and nasty lady (there's always one) got herself a twin room despite being alone. **Turns out the hotel was a few rooms short, so the driver and I were supposed to sleep in the shed outside, and this lady share accomodations with the hotel staff. Needless to say she was not amused. Neither was I.**\n\nI don't think I have to explain how dinner and breakfast went with only 2 staff members.\n\nThe tour continued on to Targu Mures. This is a very, very long ride and we ended up getting massive delays because of a tourist who just had a bladder operation, resulting in him having to go peepee about every 30 minutes. Not that big of an issue but people **will** ask if they can \"stretch their legs\". NO, you can't. Get back on the damn bus. **We ended up arriving there late, so the Kulturpalota (Highly recommended, beautiful building) was closed about 10 minutes after we got there.**\nHowever, a cleaner there asked the doorguard and he let us in anyways. Great guy, and all the tourists loved the sense of improvisation and exclusivity they got out of this situation. Perfect save.\n\nOn the way back to Bucharest we'd pass by Turda to see its citadel. I realized about 2 hours before getting there that there's no such thing as a citadel in this town, unless you count standing on your toes to peek over a yard wall to see a few stones that was once a city wall.\nSo, I changed plans. Turda is also the home to these amazingly renovated salt mine tunnels (another recommendation, google turda salt mines) and everyone was pleased with the alien beauty of this underground complex.\nI also decided to stop by these massive Roma palaces. They are known as gypsy castles, basically huge kitschy structures to show off one's wealth. Romanians hate them, foreigners love them, so I fixed a photostop, to the amazement of the driver. \"why would anyone take a picture of this?\"\n\nThe rest of the trip wasn't very eventful, but I couldn't wait to get back to Bucharest and give the planners a big piece of my mind.\n\nThey called me into the office to explain my costs, as I was about 200€ short (the bank deposit of which I used half to cover the ticket money after they didn't make proper reservations, remember?).\nSo we went over all the tickets and other expenditures before I could convince them that this was indeed **their fault.**\n\nThe girl from planning called a bit with the girl from Finance and they decided that I needed to pay the difference first, before they were able to give me my salary. This, I think, to cover the difference in the records so nobody would ask questions and their fuck-up would remain hidden.\n\nAfter this botched holiday that was saved multiple times by my intervention, getting great reviews from the tourists despite the company trying their best to ruin it, **TEN DAYS OF IT**, I grabbed the money I was due to give them and took my salary out of it (about 200€ as well) gave them 2 very big middle fingers and yelled very loudly how amateurish this whole thing was. The yelling because they wanted to cover it up, of course. \n\nNeedless to say I never heard from them again.\n\nIt feels great getting this off my chest. Thanks for reading!\n\n\n",

I tripped and fell backwards, which caused me to grip harder on my pallet jack and it squeezed my leg between the two and didn't let up until I was able to realize the pain wouldn't stop until I let go, and pushed it forward. My boss, unfortunately is my best friend for 20 years prior to working for him. He asked me if I wanted to go to the hospital, but at the same time made me feel that it was really going to put him in a bind having to sit in the hospital for several hours, and he really didn't need an injury report. I agreed to \"walk it off\" and continue the shift because I didn't want to make trouble for my friend. Now that I am home, I realized it is really sore, and I hope it's not worse than I thought it is. If it is, I could be screwed out of any recourse, because I declined to go to the hospital. I'm off tomorrow, and I was probably going to call off work on Wednesday,  and take a point, but someone quit in another department, and my supervisor told me he'd push for me to get that spot because we both feel it is a better fit for me and really improve my job security and happiness. So now, I guess I'll just have to hope my leg doesn't hurt too much and can work, and hope my friend doesn't block me from advancement as he is known to do, because it is hard to keep good workers in his department.

        "text": "Background story: Today was my first day learning the cash register. I had been working since 0800 in the morning. It was now about 1500-1600, when the rush was the hardest. We had one person in the kitchen today, two-three at cash taking orders. The line was really long now.\n\nA group of four people arrived together, age about 22-27. I took their order: The first person ordering was really slow, didn’t really know what to order (How can you not after standing in line for about 10 mins?) and changed the order so many times, the second person had a really bad tone and attitude and didn’t speak clearly at all. Took me a minute to figure out what she wanted.\n\nStory:\n\nWhen it was the third persons turn he went: \n&gt; \"Is this the *'Express'* or what?\" (indicating that I am slow)\n\nMe: \n&gt; \"It's my first day at the cash register, sorry for the delay. What do you want to eat?\" \n\nhim: \n&gt; \"*Specific burger meal*\" \n\nMe:\n&gt; \"Okay anything else to go with that?”\n\nhim after a while: \n&gt; ”Five chicken wings too\"\n\nI turned to a colleague of mine and asked where the chicken wings were on the menu (with many subcategories) because I couldn’t find them (had only made two of them before) and figured it’d be quicker than me just stressfully searching for them. She didn’t hear me.\n\nHe asked:\n&gt; ”Is this your first hour too?????”\n\nMe: \n&gt; ”No, about my fourth (it was my seventh but I didn’t know what time it was)” \n\nHim: \n&gt; ”Daamn, four hours. That’s a lot of time. Four hours..and like this..”. \n\nBy this time I had turned my head away and I tore up. My colleague pushed the wings in and patted me on the back.\n\nHim:\n&gt; ”Yoo, you need to go for a smoke-break huuhh”\n\nThen I proceeded to take his girlfriends order:\n&gt; ”Hello! Is this the same buy? Yes, okay, burger meal coming up”, \n\ntears rolling down my cheeks, she was really cool, waved him away while he was talking shit, and then my colleagues took over and the shift manager took me away to cry in the garbage room. And that was exactly what I felt like too. Garbage. \n\nI had done a splendid job the whole day, I was constantly smiling because I feel passionate about delivering these burgers to these people on their way somewhere exciting (burger joint at an airport) or coming home tired after a long trip, and not only was I smiling the whole day, my customers were too, and he was so insensitive?!? I thought that I was the last person to every cry, first day. I felt so pathetic. I won’t forget him. What a loser. What a stupid asshole. \n\nEnd of rant. Thank you.\n\n**TL;DR:** Asshole made it really clear that I should have learned the whole menu in less than one whole day and delivered his damn chicken wings faster than the speed of light. When I tore up he recommended me to go take a smoke. Bite me.\n\nEdit: Format",

        "text": "So, I have just found this sub and want to do the obligatory, using my phone so sorry for any formatting issues and also after reading the info, still unsure whether this is the right place for this to go so be gentle...\n\nThese events happened in my previous job over the course of around two months and we're the reason I left. So first off, I worked for a large store and after about a year a new Co-worker joined us. Now, the area of the store is pretty run down with lots of drugs and crime so it's not unusual for someone to come in smelling of weed. My new co-worker walked past me as I was sorting this one guy out and told my manager that it was me who smelled of weed and that she saw me smoking a joint on my break. I had to explain, embarrassingly, to my manager that it was a roll-up as I didn't have enough to buy a pack of proper cigarettes. \n\nRoughly two weeks after this 'misunderstanding' the same co-worker overhears two other employees talking about their friend from school, who has the same first name as me, who is pregnant. Again co-worker runs to the manager and tells him that it is me who is pregnant.. I get to have yet another embarrassing meeting with not only my manager, but his manager aswell. \n\nNow, this I also take to be a misunderstanding and crossed wires situation, but I start feeling cautious when around her and notice little glances and what I can only describe as hateful stares. I've never had so much as a full conversation with her so am unable to find a reason why she should hate me so I ignored it the best I could. I will also note that I'm 24 and female and am really self conscious. About three weeks after the 'pregnancy issue' I'm opening up the store with this co-worker and I'm rushed to the point of exhaustion, the heating is on full and everyone is behind thanks to late deliveries and I am sweating but not to the point where anyone could really notice. Anyway, I finish up what I was doing and grab a quick glass of water when my assistant manager comes to me and says \"co-worker has just informed me of a rather hard-to-discuss problem. She told me that when she walked past all she could smell was the worst B.O ever.\" she also told me that she couldn't smell anything but wanted to make sure I didn't stink as the customers were in the shop now. I literally couldn't help but burst into tears and I told my manager I was leaving as I couldn't work with someone who did everything they could to personally attack me. He just shrugged and said sorry it has to be this way but I wish you all the best.\n\nI really apologise for how long this is but I really needed to get this out there. To top it all off, I went to shop at a different store of the same name and guess who had been transferred there. Co-worker from hell was sat at her till and as she was the only one there I had to be served by her. I wasn't going to speak to her aside from the formalities but she decided to add insult to injury. Her exact words were: \"Oh hiya, haven't seen you in ages. Why did you leave [other store]?\" \n\nLet me just say that I now have an unhealthy obsession with spraying my entire body in deodorant and perfume at least twice before I even leave my house.\n\nTL;DR: After two months of abuse and lies to my manager by a new Co-worker, I quit my job. And the girl who caused me so much stress asks me why I left. \n",

        "text": "Greetings fellow Mindless Peons! So happy to be back here. I apologize for the absence, but CW has had some transphobic rants lately and along the days of political agony that came after that (she's thrilled Cruz pulled out of the race and is 100% certain President Trump is going to make life so much better for everyone) it just became too stressful for me to type all this up every day because frankly, I don't want to be that negative, even just for the amount of time it takes to write these.\n\nSo I'm changing up the format just a bit. TPC will now be a weekly installment, consisting of the funniest and craziest CW stuff I can get out of her, along with some observations about her daily life. I feel like this will allow me to give a better experience all around.\n\nNow that all that boring shit is out of the way, let's get to the CW.\n\nAs I type this, she is wearing a blue satin tank top with braided straps and a ruched breast section that I seriously used to own in 2004. I wore it to my college interviews with a pinstriped suit. CW is wearing it with booty shorts and boots (because she thinks flip flops are inappropriate for the office). One strap is broken on it, so she stapled it back together at home and reinforced it here at the office. She asked for my help, making sure to tell me, \"Don't pop my waterbra!\"\n\nMost of her family drama is slowly ebbing, but her son's baby's mama has almost set fire to the house 3 times recently. \"She's just a firebug. She don't mean no harm.\" The first almost-fire was when she \"was playing with a lighter on the porch\". Number two occurred when she \"dropped a match\". Number three happened when she turned the wrong eye of the stove on with a towel on it and walked outside to smoke. When she came in her kid was trying to extinguish the mini fire with the sink sprayer. She also recently increased the amount of her homeowner's insurance.\n\nOne day she was watching a video of a girl getting branded. The girl couldn't take it and jumped up, messing up the brand. I told her that 16 years ago my brother almost had to have his arm amputated because he attempted to brand himself. She then explained to me the proper forming, heating, and stamping technique, before showing me her own brand (it's a pair of tiny letters on her ass for her sons). She also showed me her giant lion ass-tattoo. When I told her now I was gonna tell her lion-ass to tell the truth, she didn't get the joke.\n\nHer chihuahua was sick last week. It wouldn't eat, and it shit in her bed a few times. \"Ain't no telling what he got into.\" But she took him to the vet, they gave him some medicine, and he got all better. She woke up the next morning to find him chewing on a bag of chex mix. \"That's how I knew he was alright. He loves chex mix.\" When I told her things like that were probably what made him sick, she said \"He's a dog! They can digest anything.\" Her son brought home a dog this week, too: a pit-mix that is apparently sweet as pie. Her cats won't stop attacking the poor thing, though. She blames the new pup. \"Can't blame the cats, pits are scary!\"\n\nWe have squirrels in our ceiling at work, and CW is convinced she can pull a Disney Princess move and get the squirrels to follow her out the door (which might work if she actually ever left on time). She told me when she was younger that she used to keep squirrel food in her bag and when she would go to parks she would feed squirrels, and no matter what park she went to they would climb up her arms and sit in her hands, in her shirt, and on top of her head. She says she would name them all and remember them, and they remembered her. So she's named the squirrels in our ceiling Johnny, June, and Roseanne, after the Cash family. Which is pretty cute, I guess. But today I found a pile of squirrel feed outside on the porch. I think she is leaving it for them in hopes she can raise a squirrel army. \n\nCW is also convinced she has a \"heart flutter\", which is not the same thing as a murmur, according to her. \"My heart beats, it just has a little extra couple of beats in there.\" She was complaining of chest pain the other day. \"Maybe if I go smoke a cigarette it'll ease off.\"\n\nShe got penalized by the IRS for her husband not paying his 2005 taxes, so she's on the warpath about that. \"I didn't even know him in 2005! I'm gonna go find out who all those IRS guys were dating back then and send them bills for their girlfriends' credit cards.\" Call me crazy but I don't think it works like that.\n\nShe got a jury summons and was the happiest woman alive. \"I hope it's a family law case, I can probably give the attorneys a few pointers.\"\n\nFinally, we have a sexy mailman here at the office, and I'll take pains to get myself out on the porch when he's filling those boxes. I wasn't actually thinking of him the other day, but walked out and he was there, and CW was behind me. She loudly said, \"Damn girl, you were right. I see why you want him to...deliver a package to you.\" He turned around, gave us both a disgusted look, and walked to his mail truck. Worse than cockblocking: I got clam jammed.\n\n*Quotes from the CW* - Here is where I'll give some of her one-liners, presented with no context for your reading pleasure.\n\n* \"Ain't nothin slower in my neighborhood than a tweaker in a hurry.\"\n\n* \"I have a dildo just like that! Haven't ever used mine to knock someone's teeth out though.\"\n\n* \"That's like something from the movie The Eyes Have Hills.\"\n\n* \"Yeah, they're just like me. Hot and heavy in the beginning, then they fizzle out after the good part.\"\n\n* \"She's bipolar again this week.\"\n\n* \"I feel like I got body lice all over, I'm so itchy!\" *scratches furiously*\n",

        "text": "**On a Tuesday in April...**\n\nToday CW wanted to talk about boobs. I'm having some difficulty finding a reasonably priced strapless bra, and most of my clothes need one (I usually just tuck my straps on the side but it looks terrible) so she started telling me about her Victoria's Secret experience. Apparently her boobs are a cup size apart, so she buys water bras and fills the side that needs it, or buys heavily padded bras and removes the pads from one side to put on the other.\n\nShe is also 100% convinced that bras cause cancer because \"when all that shit's smashed in there together it just causes bad stuff to happen.\"\n\nUsing her flawless logic, I'll now be burning all my bras to do what's best for my boobs.\n\nComments during the Boobversation: \n\n- \"If men had tits, bras would come free with every Happy Meal, oil change, and visit to the strip club.\" \n\n- \"If men had boobs, they wouldn't need women anymore.\" \n\n- \"If my B.O.B. could cut the grass, I wouldn't need men anymore.\"\n\n- \"Hell, they have vibrators that fit in your computer, they might as well make em that do something useful.\"\n\n(She and her husband are talking about a divorce again, so she's reminded me daily how happy she is to have a B.O.B. in her life.)\n\nSpeaking of divorce, they're discussing it because he lied on his taxes about a bunch of stuff and it affected hers (which she had already filed) so now they're being audited because he only claimed like $2,000 when their company made a lot more than that. She covered her ass, though, and called the accountant, somehow getting it straightened out. But now she wants a divorce again.\n\nShe knows I'm taking my ServSafe exam Monday and offered to get our client that she was so involved with a few weeks ago to train me because he's a ServSafe manager. So she's talking about getting a divorce, and offering me tutoring lessons from one of our clients who is literally going to court in a week about his own divorce...\n\nI haven't mentioned her oldest son a lot, usually the drama is with her youngest. But her oldest got kicked out of his dwelling place and moved in to live on her couch (I guess her other son's girlfriend had enough and went back to her man, because he's trying to work it out with his baby's mama now). \n\nHer younger son has cameras all over the house and in the yard, because why wouldn't he? He noticed some money was missing and went back to check the tape and it was his older brother stealing from him. The older brother had a meth problem in the past, and she is worried that because he's stealing money now he's got the same problem. \n\nThe younger son also had his truck in the front yard \"hanging in a tree\"...when I asked CW what that meant, she said he put a pulley system in a tree by the house and uses it to jack the truck up to work on it. When I mentioned that might not be the safest option, you know, if a branch breaks and makes a tire pancake out of her son, she reassured me that he has a few stacks of cinderblocks around, so if the truck falls it'll knock those over first. I asked what would happen if they happened to fall over on his head, and she said \"hell, maybe it'll knock some sense into him.\"\n\nSo the younger son goes back to check the video from the cameras pointed at his truck and, surprise of all surprises, his brother stole a large, heavy chain out of the bed of it. He went on a rampage, there was a fight, CW pulled out her gun and \"controlled the situation\" (she fired a warning shot into the air. Do not ever do this.)\n\nShe also informed me today that she's a \"breath holder\"...when she got her tattoo she held her breath and passed out under the needle. When she's stressed or in pain she just holds her breath without knowing it. She told me that when she has sex, half the men she's with will stop and make sure she's still alive because she stops breathing while in the act. (Hun, you're not doing it right.)\n\nFinally, I hate to end this on a sad note but a neighbor found one of CW's cats dead in her yard yesterday. She said the cat had been missing for about a week, and when she found her it looked like she had been attacked by a hawk (which is not uncommon around here), so she wrapped and buried her and had a small funeral in her backyard. CW was pretty upset about it, I'm going to bring her some flowers and a little stuffed kitty tomorrow.\n\nToday's Coworker Chronicles is dedicated to the memory of Kitty Tina Turner, named so because she had very long back legs and liked to walk in circles. Rest in peace, KTT.\n\n**4/20 - Thank God I Smoke a Ton of Weed**\n\nI got to work a little early today. When I arrived, CW was fighting with the shredder. Not like trying to dislodge paper from it or anything; she was kicking the bottom bin that the shreds fall into and calling it a dumbass over and over again. I unplugged and unclogged it, it worked for a few more minutes then overheated and shut off. \"This thing is supposed to take 8 sheets but that's a buncha malarkey.\"\n\nShe said again that she wanted to take the paper shreds home and let her grandson play in them; when I mentioned that inhaling the powder from the shreds probably isn't the best for him, she said \"oh I'll just give him a handful at a time, tell him to throw it then run away so he don't breathe much in. It makes good mulch anyway, and maybe he'll build a snowman out of it or something.\"\n\nSpeaking of the grandson, he's afraid that a possum is going to get into the house because there was one on their porch last night eating some cat food. There is also cat food in the house, so he slept in CW's bed last night out of possum fear.\n\nShe's writing her two sons out of her will, which is causing family drama because she's giving her house to her son's baby's mother so her grandson has a place to live. This is if, god forbid, anything should ever happen to CW. She may outlive all of them though, just out of spite.\n\nShe said her son has been bringing home random items lately, like a new filing cabinet and a coffee table. She has no clue where he's getting it from, and doesn't seem to care. \"I ain't asking questions when I'm getting free new furniture!\"\n\nShe found her dog chewing on a piece of moldy pizza last night, which really freaked her out, so she's going home today to deep clean and make a little headstone for Kitty Tina Turner.\n\nShe spent most of today narrating her Facebook pictures and videos for me, which is her favorite thing to do when I have lots of work to get done. She also did her couponing for the week.\n\nA very large dog came up on our porch at work; I got him water and she took pictures to put on Facebook so we could find his owner. We moved our phone outside and hung out with the dog for the last part of her time here, until his owners came looking for him; it ended up being the owner of my favorite boutique in town so CW mentioned how much I talk up their store in an effort to get me some discounted clothes. Totally didn't work but it was a nice try on her part.\n\nShe wore a fluorescent pink lace shirt today, ate a honey bun, and drank a coke and a bottle of spark energy drink.\n\n**The Day Prince Died**\n\nWe are moving into a new office next week, and today we got a big new office printer and a new phone system that works with headsets instead of handsets, and CW is very confused and upset with these changes.\n\nOur printer won't email documents to us, and I'm not exactly computer savvy, so we just kind of gave up on that and kept doing it on the old scanner. She said, \"You know it's a female printer, it keeps having trouble with mail.\"\n\nHer youngest son seems to have cleared his head about the girl he was cheating with; he told her to move on. This prompted a proud mother speech from CW. She told me her son used to be a gymnast, and he was training for the junior olympics. He was also a baseball player, in little league all-stars, just the perfect specimen of athleticism...until he smoked the \"devil's crystals\".\n\nOne of her older son's friends has gone nuts: he tried to steal a bunch of their tools, then one of their trucks, and when her son went out to confront him, he tried to run him over. They got him away from their property but he disappeared into the woods so now there is a minor manhunt going on down there (the police are involved) and CW is incredibly paranoid that they're going to try to come into her home.\n\nShe slept by her back door last night with a gun, just in case.\n\nShe said as she was leaving the gas station this morning (buying cigarettes and her breakfast) that a gentlemen stopped her and told her she looked like someone famous. \"I expected him to say [Leah Remini](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/649667378498834432/Ib6wMV-9.jpg) because I get that a lot, but he surprised me! He said I looked like [Mariah Carey](http://img2.timeinc.net/people/i/2015/news/150511/mariah-carey-435.jpg). It made my day!\"\n\nI hate to burst all your bubbles, but my coworker looks like neither of those women. \n\nHer thoughts on Prince? \"I didn't like him, he always seemed kinda queer to me. No man should wear pants that tight or silky shirts like that. But it is sad. Did he die from AIDS?\"\n\nToday she had a Snickers, a pack of peanut M&amp;M's, two swiss cake rolls, and a spark energy drink. I asked her how she eats all that and stays so skinny and she told me it was because she was raised on chocolate so her body just knows how to digest it properly.\n\nWhich is obviously the most reasonable explanation.",

        "text": "**One Friday in April**\n\nEvery day when I come into work, I never know if CW will deliver on the \"holy shit did she just say that?\" level that I expect. Thankfully for all of us, I'm usually wrong.\n\nCW and I are friends on Facebook, you see, so I've been able to follow all her family drama very publicly. She posted a picture of a book this morning entitled \"When Your Adult Child Disappoints You\" and tagged her son in the comments. A verbal war ensued. Basically she's calling him out on being a piece of shit and sleeping with his best friend's girl while he's got a baby and baby's mama living at his house. He thinks he should be able to do what he wants.\n\nSo last night he apparently got a hotel room with \"the skank of Dixie\". She read me the text message chain, which began with the words (from her) \"Son, she must swallow or have a gold plated pussy.\" \n\nI'll give it to her, she has a way with words.\n\nShe told him she was kicking his lazy ass out if he spends one more night in a hotel with that \"white trash cum dumpster\". She told him that he should be ashamed of himself, and that his little harlot should have her sons taken away and given to their daddies, if she even knows who their daddies are. She told him he better go pick up his food stamp card and fill up their damn cabinets with food for *his* son and if he spent one penny of that money on her kids, she was gonna start throwing his shit out into the yard.\n\nSomeone called her and told her that her son was sitting in a truck in a hotel parking lot looking very upset; CW figured he got stood up by the girl. She sent him a snide text saying that, and he responded with an equally rude text about what a shitty mother she is for not supporting him always.\n\nIt turns out, he wasn't being stood up, he was waiting on the girl to come out of the hotel room, before taking her to the grocery store and buying her about $350 worth of food and drink for herself and her two sons. He then drove her to her home (that she shares with his former best friend, the same guy that beat his car to pieces the other night) and the best friend came out and kicked his ass.\n\nCW was WAY too happy about that. \"He'll get what he deserves.\"\n\nAll this was documented fully on Facebook. \n\nIn other news, one of her cats is sick again with a respiratory problem. She tried to give it a hot steam bath...which obviously didn't work well...so she resorted to just steaming up the bathroom and holding the kitty in there to clear out his lungs. \n\nShe's been doing this 3x a day, which uses up most of her hot water, so she's been taking cold showers this week.\n\nHer grandson overheard her say that she had to \"go to hell\" (she was talking about going to work) last night, so when she got up today he said \"Mimi, I wanna go to hell with you!\" which to me, is just hilariously adorable. She didn't bother to correct him; now he just thinks she works in hell. I don't really understand the physics of that in a Christian household but, whatever floats your boat to Hades.\n\nMy favorite CW quote of the day came while we were talking about a Pirate Fest that one of the beaches not far from here does. She and her husband go yearly, and apparently last year she saw a couple of pirates that \"made [her] crotch sweat.\"\n\nShe also told me a story about her mother telling her she got a tattoo of a mouse on her hip, and when CW asked to see it she showed her the area it should be, there was nothing there. Her mom said, \"dammit! My pussy must have eaten my mouse.\"\n\n**The Next Monday**\n\nI start school today, and was a little late due to a meeting with the financial aid office, but it was still an interesting day nonetheless. When I arrived, we had a client in office who was picking up her divorce papers. She and CW were discussing one of the items she was getting back from her husband--a Bible, but not the right one. \"This ain't my Bible,\" the woman said angrily. \"Mine is a Celebrating Recovery Bible. This ain't it.\" She also dumped the belongings she was retrieving on the table, among which was a bottle of pills. \"Now you know this ain't none of the good stuff. He kept all that for himself.\" CW laughed.\n\nShe told the woman to call her if she ever wanted to go get a celebratory beer now that she's single. It was like having two CW's for a moment there. I didn't like it.\n\nMeanwhile, in CW's life, her son has been sending suicidal texts to her and his baby's mama, with whom he's trying to make amends. She's been checking on him but says he \"don't have the balls it takes to do something like that.\"\n\nShe and her husband co-own a business that cleans offices after hours. They recently got a write-up at their largest job for not properly cleaning, which she blames entirely on her husband. She took photos as proof and spent today going on about how much she hates him.\n\nApparently instead of working this weekend, he went camping. She did the job, then went to him, told him she was resigning as co-owner and would be an employee only. They fought, he insulted her kids, her son went nuts and made some threats, cops were almost called, just a typical weekend in Redneckaritaville.\n\nShe ate a honeybun today that she said tasted very sour. Once it was finished, she burped, and commented that her burp smelled like a fart, and now she's officially so stressed she's farting backwards.\n\n",

        "text": "Still using this throwaway until I've shared all my horrible boss stories. I think I'm going to call him BM from now on. For boss man or bowel movement, since both are accurate.\n\nSo yesterday I mentioned this pub house and the fact that BM isn't making the money he thought he'd make. Well, a while back, BM decided that a crowdfunding campaign was just what we needed for a boost. \n\nThe campaign involved authors donating books to give away as rewards for supporters. Once more the BS meter was tingling. But it gets better. The authors were also instructed to donate to the indiegogo to boost its rankings on the indiegogo pages. Oh, but it was totally okay, said BM, because he was going to pay the authors back for their donations. \n\nI know what you're thinking, isn't that fraud? Yes. Yes it is. In the immortal words of Billy Mayes, \"But wait, there's more!\" When this campaign started up, there was some grumbling from authors that it looked like BM was trying to pay his bills with an indiegogo campaign.\n\nA bit of background. BM had an author that had recently bought back the rights to their books. Immediately afterward, BM moved across country to a place known for expenses and vices. So the fact that his big payout was suddenly gone seemed a bit suspicious. \n\nWell, the grumbling reached the ears of BM, and he promptly sent out an email. In the spirit of anomimity I'm going to paraphrase.\n\n\"I hope I didn't give you the impression that this campaign was about lining my pockets, it's about... Marketing and stuff. My only bills are rent and food, so yeah, this is all about the business.\"\n\nInterestingly enough, shortly after the campaign closed, BM met a foreign woman, married her and moved overseas. For those familiar with the overseas bride buyi business, you might think that's a bit suspicious (if you have Netflix, there's a documentary on the subject). Several authors have independently contacted me to tell me the same theory that I had come up with. \n\nHmm. Curious behavior, right? Well, it gets better. Remember the email that said the indiegogo campaign wasn't about paying his bills? Shortly after leaving the country, BM sends his yearly, \"Why we're not making money\" newsletter. Authors had been questioning where the marketing we'd been promised we to. Well, in this letter, BM points out that the campaign was to keep the business, meaning him, since he was the only doing this for a full time job. (But that's a story for another time)\n\nTL;dr: BM decides to run a fraudulent indiegogo campaign, buys a wife and leaves the country. ",

        "text": "So, I'm using a throwaway account for this to avoid any future unpleasantness.\n\nI joined an \"indie publisher\" (which is a small press that publishes a few books a year and isn't an imprint of a larger traditional publisher) a while back and apparently, my bullshit meter was malfunctioning. The head of this pub house, I call him Boss for this post, talked a good game about how he knew the things traditional publishers were doing wrong and he had started a pub house as his retirement plan.\n\nmy bullshit meter failed me that day, because that should've set off alarms.\n\nHowever, I joined and slowly, but surely, my opinion of Boss deteriorated as I watched him flounder around. Around the time the SCOTUS ruled in favor of marriage equality, he went out of his way to inform all the authors at the pub house that they shouldn't be political and that everyone sharing about the ruling was going to alienate readers. My BS meter went off. Some of us had audiences that had LGBT members in it and not sharing about something so monumental was akin to not supporting the decision. We told Boss as much and he sulked for a time.\n\nFast forward to the Paris attacks. Boss went on a very public, very xenophobic rant about Muslims that sounded more like something you'd need a sheet on your head to say. Talked with a few of the other authors about calling Boss out on this, which we did. Boss claims that supporting homosexuality was political, but the very real threat of radical Islam was just stating facts. Oh boy. \n\nI now realize that I'm published by a racist and homophobe. (And according to stories I'd heard from the female contractors and authors, also a misogynist.)\n\nAround this time, Boss starts posting passive aggressive statuses in the closed pub house groups about the fact that he was losing money and that people needed to be sharing the pub house posts daily. Boss was under the impression that people in Facebook news feeds wanted to be hit multiple times a day with ads for the pub house books for sale. This strategy had killed off the pub house's social media reach, but obviously, those not doing it, weren't committed to their careers. \n\nRecently, Boss posts a couple of statuses about the various issues he has with authors and more passive aggressive bellyaching.\n\nSome authors fired back and encouraged me to speak up as well. So, I did.\n\nI told Boss that rather than posting passive aggressive statuses, like a teen with drama issues, he should talk to people since he is the publisher. I also addressed his social media policies by telling him that some of us weren't on Facebook because we'd found new ways to engage readers. (I also told him that if these new methods of engagement weren't putting enough money in his pocket, he could always run another indiegogo campaign, but that's a story for another time)\n\nAhh, the digital applause I got from the others at the pub house that were tired of his crap. Of course, he kicked me out of the pub house, but I feel pretty good about that.  Shortly afterwards, one of his best sellers also got kicked out for something similar.\n\nSide note: another author contacted me about the timing of his outbursts. She noticed that he goes on these type of tirades towards the end of every month and normally kicks someone out as well. He then offers to allow the author to buy out their contract (more on that later as well). This author believes that Boss is hurting for money so badly that he's taking it out on authors to get the excuse to kick them out and get a quick cash infusion to maintain his lifestyle.(which, will be a part of the indiegogo story.)",

        "text": "So I work for a non-profit and my boss is a quote/un-quote a dick (go ahead do that finger gesture in the air, I'll wait). In every sense of the word. Ladies and gents we've got a 3 year project funded by the European Union which begins on June 1st 2016. When is that? Oh yes, it's Wednesday....and today is Monday. Well, guess what, the past year and a half of my work negotiating the contract, finalizing the budget and the action plan so that it get's the EU's approval is all going to inevitably get flushed down the dirtiest filthiest toilet. Why you ask (You *did* ask, right?)? Well it's because while I was doing all that stuff, I was also trying to convince my boss that our organization needs to ensure that it has the staff to actually *do* the project. Yeah, I know. Imagine that. So all of my convincing fell on deaf ears and my boss and so here we are 2 days away from the start of the project, and we don't have anyone employed who actually has the skills and expertise to do the work that is required. No monitoring and evaluation expert, no documentation expert. Nothing. Why? Because my boss is stuck on this idea that he could rip off the European Union by \"PRETENDING\" to hire additional staff so that he could pocket the money that would be those staff members' salaries. Yeah. I'm dead serious. He want's to bring in his buddies to sign fake contracts, so that they could pretend to earn salaries. All just a theatrical display to pull wool over the EU's eyes and show them that everything is on the up and up, while pocketing the cash. He also doesn't want to start the *actual* project activities until September. So that's 3 months of doing absolutely nothing. I wonder what he wants me to write on the 1st quarter report?\n\nNow, myself and the finance officer are honest people caught up in this mess. We've been fighting him at every decision to no avail. Today (Monday) and tomorrow (Tuesday) there is a Monitoring and Evaluation workshop that is MANDATORY for grantees. It's also hosted by the EU to train the organizations according to EU procedures, and so people from our organization HAVVVVEEEEE TTTOOOOO BEEEE THEREEEE! Dick Boss confirmed his attendance but guess what, by 10:30am he was back at the office drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes. I absolutely was flabbergasted when I saw him roaming the halls an hour after he left! The workshop is 2 days from 9am until 3pm! Why the f*ck did he leave? Do you know what kind of impression it gives the EU? Bingo: a really shitty one. It tells them that we don't give a damn about the project and that we're only in it for the money. Well, if they thought that, they wouldn't be too far off from the truth, would they? This guy is driving the honest employees nuts! We're the ones that are going to suffer the consequences of his stupid actions, but does he care? NOPE. Heeeee's the boss. If you work the for the EU and you know which organization I'm talking about (not going to name any names here, sorry), please....I beg you, audit the crap out of us asap. I want this guy to stop thinking he's untouchable. Today, I feel like crap for being a part of this garbage. ",

        "text": "One of my positions in this company is being a manager over a facility. Our employees have to document a lot in their own handwriting which is usually a chore since many have terrible handwriting and/or poor grammar and spelling skills.\n\nOne day, we needed a report sent out as soon as possible. This employee took her time writing up the letter and getting it to us at the very last second that it needed to be sent out. I reviewed it but couldn't make sense of it. Her sentence structure was really screwed up, lacking nouns and verbs and correct tense, and her handwriting was illegible.\n\nShe had said things like\n\n&gt;He did do da going the place. Hit leg face\n\nLuckily, she had verbally stated what she had witnessed, which was supposed to be what this report detailed. One of her co-workers remembered approximately what was said.\n\nIn haste, I quickly wrote up a letter as best as I could so it could be sent out. It was not my best handwriting, but others were able to read it back to me without issues. Before sending, I needed the employee who wrote the awful, original letter to sign the new report I had done in haste as it was still, technically, *her* report.\n\nShe glances over it, then says\n\n&gt;I can't read this. My letter was much better. Who wrote this new one?\n\nThis made it even more enjoyable for me to be here and hear it from her lips. She's always trying to suck up to me by giving me fake feedback in an attempt to make me like her. Of course, I said, with a grin,\n\n&gt;Me: I did. Why? What's wrong with what I wrote?\n\n&gt;Her: Oh, well I thought what I wrote was fine.\n\n&gt;Me: Really? Read to me what you wrote. Because none of us could understand what you were trying to say.\n\nShe tried reading it but couldn't make out what *she* had written. Pulling the paper to her face, squinting her eyes...face it, lady. You wrote a terrible report and it needed to be done over again.",

        "text": "I work at a cell phone repair/retailer, where we primarily do electronics repairs. We've also got a pretty strong retail presence in our area, selling refurbished cell phones, high-end cases, and cell phone accessories. \n\nIt's normally a pretty moderately paced workplace, but we occasionally get the odd day where we've got more work to do than hands are available to actually do the work. Yesterday was one of those days - and I happened to be the only one in the store due to one guy quitting unexpectedly earlier that week.  \n\nA middle-aged, upper class looking woman (UCW) with two kids 8-10 years old in tow came in about midday to drop off her phone. The sparknotes version is that she'd gotten the screen replaced, and it had popped back up due to a mistake in putting the new one on. Now it needed a new screen, and the old one was too badly mangled to be fixed. I let her know that she would not be charged for this since it was our mistake (and the screen was under warranty), and took it back to take a look.\n\nNow, we close at 7, and this woman came in at 6. I was still working on phones and setting up special orders, and we'd had a TON of phones come in within the last two hours. Not to mention, the phone was ringing off the hook and I'd already had one couple go stalking out in a rage (\"Are you fucking serious! That's bullshit!\") because I told them their screen replacement would take 2 hours with me being the only one working the store. \n\nI actually got more done than I realized by the end of the day, but by the time I got to this woman's phone, my heart sank.\n\nThe customer before her had taken the last white iPhone 6 screen. Crap.\n\nReluctantly, I call the number she left to explain, then checked with my coworkers at the other locations for extra screens. She returned for the phone, and I explained the situation once more.\n\n&gt; Drej: Ma'am, I'm really sorry about this, but the customer before you got the last white iPhone 6 screen. Now, I've contacted our stores in NearbyTown1 and NearbyTown2, and both of them have white screens in stock. If you'd like, I can ask one of the other locations if they could hold one for you, if you'd like to visit one of them tomorrow. \n\n&gt; UCW: Well, I *need* this phone. I mean, I've got two kids that I have to communicate with during the day, I can't be without a phone. \n\n&gt; Drej: Actually, if you'd like, we can offer you one of any of the refurbished phones we have on sale currently as a loaner phone until we're able to get yours fixed. We will need to take a deposit for the phone, however.\n\n&gt; UCW: I don't want to do that, I don't have a deposit. So, what are my options? I've got my two kids, I can't just not have a phone......Can I speak to a manager? \n\nI'd given her all the options I was able to give her. The phone itself was working fine, but the messed up screen was obviously a problem. The other problem was the fact that she was trying to do this just before closing expecting an immediate solution.\n\nEnded up calling the manager currently available, as it was 6:45 at this point and this woman wanted an answer. With his help, we agreed that she could use the one black screen we had available until she was able to get into the store for the correct color. I took her phone back, put the new screen on in about fifteen minutes, and rushed back to her with a working phone that just needed to be charged. I then hurried to deal with the trickle of customers who'd come in to receive their repaired phones or try to ask if they could get theirs repaired right then and there. \n\nDropped into my workplace today on my day off to pick up something of mine I'd left. Was informed by the head tech that while I'd done a good job putting the black screen on, the phone wasn't turning on at all and needed further repairs. In my rush to get the screen on before this woman lost her patience (and she'd been actually pretty civil about the whole thing, if frustrated), I'd forgotten to actually turn the phone off and disconnect the battery before working on it, thus causing a short. \n\nIt was a busy day and a learning experience for me, but I'm coming from jobs where you NEVER keep the customer waiting. It was kind of comforting to learn from the others that I could slow down and take my time with this sort of work, and the customers could shut it and learn some patience if they wanted their delicate electronic device repaired.
