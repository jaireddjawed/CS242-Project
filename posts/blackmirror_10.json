It shattered me seeing himn make that annual pilgrimage, seeing the silhouette of \"his\" daughter getting older only to discover what a cheating bitch Beth was. I was already suspecting the chinese dude and her had something going on given how close he was sitting to her in the bar scene. But shit, seeing how she cheated then tried to kill the baby, then blocked the guy without saying a thing to him is just disgusting. \n\nWhen I was getting all emotional  as Joe was first shown lurking at the woods near Beth's dad's my sister was like \"What's up with you?\" \n\nI told her I'm just getting dad vibes and asked if she really isn't feeling anything seeing Joe having to stalk his own daughter. \n\nShe was like, \"No\" \n\nI told her she'd understand if she were a guy. \n\n\n\nThis is a part a lot of people leave out when talking about this episode--how devastating it was for Joe to go through what he did. I was crazy rooting for him the entire time. That part really got to me, I don't know why. I'm probably too young to be getting dad vibes but idk lol\n\nanyone else feel the same?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/blackmirror/comments/98a1sr/spoilers_uss_callister_feels_weirdly_meta/",
        "text": "So allow me to explain what I mean: USS Callister feels like Black Mirror has gone out of its own universe and is doing the very type of thing that some of the prior episodes warn about: a kind of 'justice porn.'\n\nCompared to others in the series, it feels distinctly out of place, with the clear-cut 'bad guy' getting comeuppance for his 'wrong deeds.'\n\nIt feels like society enjoying laughing at the awkward, geeky/nerdy character and reveling in seeing him get punished for being such a weird freak. \n\nI imagine what some of you are probably thinking is: But of course in the context of the story, he's a terrible person, unquestionably. That's why he's so deserving of what he gets. \n\nBut what awkward geeky/nerdy person hasn't had that experience of dealing with stereotypes of people thinking you do freakishly horrible/weird things in your off-time because you're a little awkward? I thought that stereotype was somewhat dying out, but this episode seems to revive it in full, playing with the idea that even private venting of issues on computer programs is not ok because \"oh no, they might be real.\"\n\nI've seen in discussions about this episode people say, \"He knew they were conscious.\" Did he though? Am I forgetting an important and obvious detail? When is it actually implied, much less shown explicitly, that he sees them as conscious beings? As far as I can tell, for all we know, from his perspective, he is torturing people who are in no way real and it's little different from, for example, someone having a fantasy of raping someone else (e.g. it's not real - just a fantasy of having power in a fantasy world, as compared to the real world, where he feels powerless).\n\nThe questions raised by this episode seem paltry, if not completely missing. What are they exactly? It gets wrapped up far too well. The 'bad guy' loses, the apparently 'sentient AI' are unquestionably sentient and real, and we are given no reason to question this fact. \n\nIf it is posing questions at video games in general, it seems to be coming from a position of ignorance. Of someone whose sole understanding of video games and those who play them is the absolute worst stereotypes of them. \n\nWorth noting, there is also a sense of elation to it, at the end. In a way, it is a joyful, satisfying conclusion. I think this causes some people to remember it more fondly than other episodes. But what lesson does it teach? That you should never fantasize because of the possibility that you could be hurting something with a real consciousness? \n\nCertainly he goes too far, in terms of creepily getting their DNA, but this in itself is not a horrific crime. It's just a creepy act as part of what is portrayed as a terrible crime. \n\nIt's a strange episode for me and it seems to miss the very point the show makes more than once about the dangers of people reveling in justice brought down on others. The main character's end, after all, if we follow the foreshadowing, implies that he will probably die over it, slowly, while trapped in total isolation. Is this punishment fitting, even if we assume that he saw himself as torturing sentient beings? Or is it just 'justice porn'?\n\nThis episode seems like an unfair depiction of awkward/geeky/nerdy people and of video games in general. The reason this bothers me is not because it is inherently unfair to do such a depiction, but because it's such an easy target and one that plays well with the masses. Whereas many Black Mirror episodes seem about getting you to stop and question your assumptions, this one seems like it's playing right into assumptions and reveling in them. It doesn't make any point to draw a distinction between those who are awkward and normal, and those are awkward and evil. Instead, it focuses only on tropes of the worst of video game culture. The jokey part at the very end, while well executed, seems especially pandering to the perception that games are only played by bratty, childish people.\n\nI want to like it and in many ways, I think it's a fun sort of episode, comparing to the dismal tone of many others. But it also seems like the low-hanging fruit and doesn't offer anything particularly notable to think about.",

They're written by me and published by Hodder and they both say 'perfect for fans of Black Mirror' on the cover. The stories are about leaked emails, bots, VR - even a political scandal featuring a pig. See [matthewblakstad.com](https://matthewblakstad.com) for info. These are the last of my free copies from my publisher. I'm happy to mail them to the first few UK people who ask, basically until I run out. Let me know which you'd like ('both' is fine). All I ask in return is an honest review on Amazon or GoodReads. Mentioning them on here would also be great. Thanks.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/biijsq2pbog11.jpg",

If you could make human AI duplicates like that you could just edit them to not have suffering and emotional quirks like humans to make them run better. \n\nThey don't even take them to an interesting place past White Christmas, which didn't even all that much itself. Why would you use human AI to do inane stuff like control the lights in your house. What if you copied some geniuses and put them in a room together then sped up their time to 10,000 years, you'd instantly get 10,000 years worth of intellectual thought. White Christmas could have went for the point of, does it really count as you admitting a crime if it wasn't you but just your replica? But it didn't really explore that.\n\nNow it's just a cheap way to say \"omg we were ai the whole time 2deep4me\" as if that's even a functional twist anymore since we've seen it like 4 times now.\n\nPersonally I think Netflix should go for more modern stuff like shut up and dance or hated in the nation that deal with modern things. I actually prefer out there sci fi ideas but they just haven't been doing them as well as before imo.\n\nJust my opinion. Agree or disagree?",

But one thing I noticed about this series compared to other series (which I tend to binge if I get really into it) is that I found Black Mirror to be virtually unbingable because of how much processing I have to do after each episode. The most I ever went was around 2 1/2 episodes. So did you guys go through all of the episodes at once or did it take you guys awhile? \n\nNote: This question is more aimed at people who only started watching Black Mirror when it came out on Netflix. I know it was originally on Channel 4 in Great Britain, but obviously the episode would come out slower, making it hard to binge that way.",

        "text": "I want to love \"White Christmas\", I really do. It's a fan favourite, it touches on some great themes and it's one of the episodes that completely ruins my day when I watch it (... in a good way). But there are tons of little details that I think don't quite add up:\n\n* What is (Cookie) Joe doing for the five years in the simulated cabin? He thinks he's doing some sort of job, but later can't remember. Either he was working, and the memory lapse is unexplained, or he wasn't, in which case we know neither what he was doing nor how the false memory of a job got there.\n* Is (Cookie) Matt present for the five years in the cabin? He acts like he's been there and they've occasionally spoken, but how is that possible? He says to the officers that he tweaked the simulation so it felt like five years to Joe - implying that was before he entered the simulation. So how does Joe have memories of Matt? (And side question: how could the officers not realise about the five years when they were present in the room and could see the simulation controller screen with \"1826 days\" (or whatever) on the screen.)\n* Why do things from Beth's dad's place keep appearing in the simulation as the episode progresses? It doesn't make sense in hindsight that the clock and snow globe would appear randomly. It also doesn't make sense that we would see Beth's daughter dead in the field (and how would she only make it 20 metres from the house before dying?).\n* Joe hears a door slam shut in the cabin - is this in the simulation (what is that effect meant to achieve?) or in his head (what is he remembering? that sound doesn't occur in the flashback)?\n* What is up with the final effect of the camera zooming out of the cabin, which is in a snow globe, which is in a cabin, which is in a snow globe, ...? Is it supposed to imply some nested reality (the simulation is within infinitely many more simulations)? Or is it just meaningless bullshit?\n\nDoes anyone have any answers to these questions? - I would love to just be missing something obvious, and for these all to make sense. Has anyone else been bothered by these things, and if so, does it affect your enjoyment of the episode?",

        "text": "Hello, I know it's been a while since the episode premiered, but I saw it for the first time recently and a theory arose.\n\nAll the characters are part of a network of pedophiles. From the brain to the client.\n\nLet's go by parts.\n\n1: **Georgina Tarrington**, Involved by e-mail and racist jokes.\n\nShe gets involved in a scandal because of racism, but I'm sure she could go ahead with it or claim that they are false. But there is an important detail On the screen of the computer she's looking at, we can see that she's the CEO of the hotel chain [Wayhaven](http://es.web.img3.acsta.net/newsv7/16/10/26/09/36/225410.jpg), the same hotel that Hector was waiting for the prostitute.\n\nIt is responsible for providing a safe and discreet place.\n\nA little related to what they asked her to do, provide, she provided the vehicle for Hector and Kenny\n\n2: **Hector**, we know his story, a man who wants to \"try new experiences\", hiring a prostitute.\n\nWhat we do not know is what kind of prostitute. At the moment when the blackmailers contacted him, Hector wanted to vomit (And I'm sure he did). But thinking it over, is it worth an adultery to commit a bank robbery? I mean, cheating is bad thing, but is not something a Couple Therapy can not solve. No, it was something worse than infidelity.\n\nReturning to Hector's hotel room, not only did he have lingerie, he had a **camera**.\n\nWhy would a man, who was afraid that his wife knew about his cheating, risk having evidence?\n\n**Hector was waiting for an underage prostitute and filming child pornography.**\n\n3:**The man on the motorcycle**. With this dude, we do not know anything, just the final scene of \"Are you a pervert now?\" of the end with the family.\n\nWith him, I'm sorry but I'll force the theory a bit in this part.\n\nWhat if there is more symbolism in this part of what we really think.\n\nHe was the \"messenger\", the one in charge of delivering the package (the cake) to Kenny.\n\nHe was a distributor-seller of the pornography they filmed or sent him. The person in charge who was dedicated to the pornography reaching the customers.\n\nThat was his crime.\n\n4: Finally, **Kenny** and the **Forest Guy**. \"I was just looking at pictures.\" \"Me too.\" we have **the** **customers**, those for whom there is a demand for that disgusting content.\n\nWith this, all are connected, which provides a safe place for pedophiles, who creates the content, who distributes it and who consumes it.\n\nThis is my theory, I hope it is understood. Tell me what you think",

I think with some more length and some more background it could be one of the better episodes of the series.\n\nThe idea I had (not that I’m qualified to rewrite it) was what if the whole episode you’re watching the journey of all the characters (the three actual actors + the kid and other not shown characters), and throughout the entire thing they keep comforting the child by telling her “oh yeah when you find the bear, make sure to hug it in this certain way” or whatever, you know, to let her imagination take over the bleak reality. They get into this wear house, same as in the real episode, and they all get attacked by the metal creatures. The last two people alive are the main woman and the child, and the woman is about to be killed, unless the child intervenes. The child starts crawling towards the bear however, in what appears to be a moment of weakness. But as she hugs the bear in this special way, it releases some sort of signal that disarms the creatures. \n\nThat’s my idea, and sorry it’s very rough and all over the place. ",

It's rare to find people that can joke around and say some messed up stuff but it still be funny and comfortable with each other. The guy is awkward and shy but when someone makes the first move and opens up, he'll open up too and be one of your best friend.",

        "text": "Firstly the concept of clickbait feels very black mirror-ian, and they use that in every video to get clicks. They are rich from scamming naive and vulnerable children, flaunt their wealth in the least subtle way, in such a way that their audience appreciates and worships their superficial possessions, and wants what they have. They are obsessed with someone who constantly takes advantage of them, promotes the worst qualities in a human, and lives off their attention. We have come to a point where one of them filmed a dead man in a forest, and just treated it like an OMG YOU WOULDNT BELIEVE WHAT I FOUND!!!!!!!!!! plot point. He treated someone’s suffering as a way for him to get more views and money. Even in his apology, he talks about himself, displays his ego, and PROMOTES HIS OWN BRAND AT THE END OF IT!!!! I know that the only things these people want is attention (in which they do many immoral things for) but I want more people do realize that these are more than just a silly or cringe YouTubers, these are borderline dystopian. \n\nIn conclusion, I’m sickened that people this greedy, self absorbed, talentless, unethical,  and mean are regarded as the ultimate form of cool and a role model for millions. \n\nMy last words are: This is a social media cult, with dangerous impacts and millions of members. \n\nOh and don’t even get me started on the shit that jake and Logan  Paul fans do and say.  It is ultimate proof that they are brainwashed",
