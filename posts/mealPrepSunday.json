I don't see a post about it. My effort is at the bottom.  Go easy on me this is my first attempt.\n\nSome of you may have seen the Joshua Weissman's meal prep video from last month:\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=AYXfaVD5o40\n\nFor someone that is just getting into Meal Prep what do you think of it? My impression is that Weissman is not making actual food that he intends to eat.  It looks more like entertainment video than useful advice. These are some of my takes on the video:\n\n1. Moisture.  One of the things that makes for tasty food is high moisture content. Weissman cooks the chicken sous vide to preserve moisture. He never gives it a pan sear or the flame thrower treatment. He stores it for a week in the fridge.  Is this chicken going to taste good?\n\n2. Weissman uses a rice cooker.  Rice cookers are very common in the body builder community.  It looks like another plug in device that I don't need. Do you use a rice cooker?\n\n3. The boxes he uses are flimsy and don't look like they will be air tight.  The boxes are very constraining. For instance he stacks the chicken on the lettuce.  That lettuce is going to wilt in a week. Even allowing for some creative license with the video, I'm seeing packing problems like the bread is going to get wet.\n\n4. Salmon. He cooks the salmon and sticks it in the fridge for a week. Generally I have a three day limit for fish in the fridge. He does this thing where he makes skewers of Salmon and vegetables. I find that this is a good way to burn the veggies and under cook the Salmon.\n\n5. He makes a fried vegetable thing.  It looks really appetizing in the container but I generally don't like fried food the next day.\n\n6. Salad.  The salad looks terrific but if you put the dressing on the lettuce you have a couple of seconds before it wilts. Nobody likes having a ton of containers but just separating the greens and the dressing would make this last a week.\n\n7. The breakfast sandwich. The bread is going to be soggy. I'm not going to make a turkey thing. This is too much work.  I also can't eat that much in the AM.\n\nThis is my effort.  I would say that is is inspired by Joshua Weissman more than a recipe from Joshua Weissman.\n\n\n\nhttps:\/\/0x0.st\/HzTX.jpg\n\nHoney Mustard Chicken Sous vide. \n\n* 1 tablespoon honey\n* 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard\n* 5 cloves garlic\n* 1\/4 cup olive oil\n* 1 teaspoon salt\n* some pepper.\n* tyme\n* marjorum\n\nmarinate the chicken in the sauce over night and sous vide 2hrs at 62C(143F).\n\nThe chicken I got was organic boneless skinless chicken breast from Leclerc at 29 euros\/kg.  This is unsustainable. There must be a cheaper way to make lunch.\n\nI really enjoyed the video but other than convincing me too cook something I don't know that it has any useful advice.","upvote_ratio":0.66,"created_utc":1677660083.0},{"title":"5lbs of skirt steak for meal prep.

I have a horrible tendency to buy meat, put off cooking it, and then toss it in the freezer right on or before the best by date. As a result, I have a lot of raw meat in my freezer. I\u2019m trying to figure out the best way to deal with all of it since I don\u2019t want to thaw something until I\u2019m ready to cook it since it was kind of near the use by date when it went into the freezer. This is what I\u2019ve got: boneless\/skinless chicken thighs, boneless\/skinless chicken breasts, ground turkey, ground beef, and maybe ground chicken. \n\nI\u2019m obviously trying to cure myself of this habit - the last time I bought ground beef, I portioned out two 1lb bags and froze flat and then cooked the third pound that day or the next. The rest of the frozen meat is either in its original tray packaging (ground) or in ziplock bags (breasts\/thighs) and is going to be a real pain to separate until fully thawed. \n\nI\u2019ve read it\u2019s not safe to put frozen raw meat into a crockpot on low because it\u2019ll take too long to reach a safe temperature and in the meantime, it\u2019ll hang out in the danger zone with potential for bad things to grow. I guess one of my questions is this - what\u2019s the fastest safest way to deal with this? The ground meat in original packaging I can probably pop face down into my Dutch oven  on low heat and then peel off the absorbent pack when it\u2019s thawed a little. Hopefully that not dangerous since I\u2019m not intending to leave it in there any longer than it takes to remove it. For the breasts\/thighs, though, I\u2019m less sure what to do. \n\nAnd what should I even make once the meat is thawed? The ground stuff will likely end up as meat sauce, chili, or taco\/enchilada filling since I can kind of thaw and cook while breaking it up and not have to worry about reforming it into something else before cooking. Really not sure what to do with my giant frozen blocks of raw chicken though. Please help?

Unsurprisingly, her health was deteriorating rapidly!\n\nOnce I learned this was her situation, I bought a ton of containers and went about preparing her anti-inflammatory meals and providing her with healthy breakfasts and snacks.

Meal examples list in the comments.\n\nI hope this is allowed \u2013 it\u2019s meal planning, not prepping, but I consider meal planning the more exhausting sibling to meal prep, or maybe a stepping stone toward building the habit of meal prep. I struggle with motivation & depression, so the biggest hurdle for meal-prep for me is dealing with decision fatigue (it sounds silly, but for some people, it\u2019s a real thing and it sucks when it drains your mental energy to the point you don\u2019t even wanna cook anymore), and making sure I have all the ingredients. If just knowing what I\u2019m going to use my groceries for is the closest I\u2019ll get to actual meal prep, I\u2019ll take it as a win, and hope this can help others who struggle with decision fatigue and such.\n\nWhile looking for solutions to bypass this energy-sucking brain glitch of mine, I found out about micro-decisions (all the little things we decide on all day every day \u2013 what to wear today, what to watch, where to sit while I do homework, what to eat for breakfast\u2026 that sort of thing) and blocking out time to make all these decisions for the week in one go. For instance, instead of checking the weather and figuring out what to wear *each morning*, on Sunday nights, I will pull up my weather app, look at the lows & highs, and hang my week\u2019s clothes in order of when I\u2019ll wear them, including socks\/stockings, and maybe accessories. I couldn\u2019t believe how something so stupid, something so many people have already been doing for hundreds of years, made my mornings easier.\n\nClothing prep is one thing. But meal prep is another beast entirely. One I fail to tame every time I try. Why? Because it still involves more decision fatigue than I can handle. Sitting down each week and deciding what to eat relies on things I don\u2019t already have in my closet (I mean, fridge\/pantry). And nothing against recipes, but the internet\u2019s only solution is always a mass of recipes that are never ever \u201chere\u2019s your protein, here\u2019s your side, season\/oil it however you want, cook til done\u201d \u2013 I don\u2019t mind recipes sometimes, but not every meal or meal-prep session has to be that big an event. Even searching \u201cno recipes\u201d meal ideas is an excavation.\n\nSo I figured out *I* have to be the one to make the list of \u201cthrow these on a plate together\u201d meals. No sink full of mixing bowls and measuring spoons required. I sat down to write a list of the easiest things I\u2019ve liked making\/cooking\/eating in the past, keeping my dietary needs in mind. \n\nBut to further cut down on the decision fatigue, I went with a list of TWENTY dishes for each meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack). If I couldn\u2019t think of something else, I repeated some favourites or mix-and-matched similar meal components (I also have a few recipe-reliant items, too, because it\u2019s not the cooking I dislike, it\u2019s the decision fatigue taking the energy to cook out of me).\n\nThen I bought a D20 (20-sided die). On Sundays, I roll for each meal for each day of the week, and shop for those meals, if needed.\n\nThis may be the closest I\u2019ll ever come to meal-prepping, but I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s a stepping stone. I feel like this method can work to combat decision fatigue on larger portions, too.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1675876958.0},{"title":"Breakfast bowls are my jam!","author":"bazar79","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/fbz5hv7961ha1.jpg","text":"Think this qualifies as meal prepping as makes several servings.

FRIDGE PREP (this foods are stored in the fridge which means they last about 1 week at best)\n\n    1.1. Pre-cooked whole meal\n(a whole meal with seasoning and all the ingredients mixed that IS cooked\/baked\/grilled, for example a casserole which goes directly into a container and when you want to eat it you need to bake it)\nVIDEO: https:\/\/youtu.be\/bs7ZTz0Xw0w\n\n    1.2. Non-cooked whole meals\n(a whole meal with seasoning and all the ingredients mixed but is NOT cooked\/baked\/grilled, for example a casserole which you baked and then after it cools it goes directly into a container and when you want to eat it you just need to reheat it)\n\n    1.3. Ingredient prep\n(no particular dishes are made, you just slice, chop and prepare individual ingredients; dice up veggies, boil eggs, cook plain rice, slice up fruits... This way you don't have to eat pre-made meals, rather you have more flexibility to make variety of meals throughout the week) \nVIDEO: https:\/\/youtu.be\/vmdITEguAnE \n\n\n\n\n2. FREEZER PREP (these foods are stored in the fridge which means it lasts for months and also you can store larger quantities of food)\n\n    2.1. Pre-cooked whole meals\n(a whole meal with seasoning and all the ingredients mixed that IS cooked\/baked\/grilled, for example a casserole which goes directly into a container and when you want to eat it you need to bake it)\nVIDEO: https:\/\/youtu.be\/R89OA6v5NEo\n\n\n    2.2. Non-coocked whole meals\n(a whole meal with seasoning and all the ingredients mixed but is NOT cooked\/baked\/grilled, for example a casserole which you baked and then after it cools it goes directly into a container and when you want to eat it you just need to reheat it)\nVIDEO: https:\/\/youtu.be\/z0iaAKzNRPY (first part of the videos are non-cooked dishes)\n\n    2.3. Ingredients prep\n(no particular dishes are made, you just slice, chop and prepare individual ingredients; dice up veggies,  cook plain rice, slice up fruits... This way you don't have to eat pre-made meals, rather you have more flexibility to make variety of meals) \n \n\nIn my opinion I would try more freezer prepping rather than fridge prepping because we are a big family and we are all very busy. So having MORE prepared food seems like a bettee solution.\n\nNow, I'm a bit confused as to should I bake and cook whole meals and the freez them, or just make the dishes without baking or just freeze individual ingredients (like veggies and stuff)? \n\nObviously I can use different techniques, I don't need to commit to only one, but I would like to know which one is the most efficient.\n\nFYI: We are vegetarians so If anybody has any delicious, rich and hearty vegetarian recipes feel free to send the links :D","upvote_ratio":0.83,"created_utc":1674821242.0},{"title":"I\u2019m all set for \u2018Waffle Wednesday\u2019 for the next 11 weeks!

I'm a vegetarian though, and the friend is not. Additional challenge- they also try to eat lower carb meals. She's totally up for my mac & cheese (because it's freaking amazing) and some sloppy joes, but I'd like for her to have a pretty solid base of stuff that doesn't look like 2 months of cheat meals.\n\nSomething I also realized was how very tired I was of not having fresh stuff - there was always salad, but most everything else was coming out of the freezer to be nuked. I made sheet pan fajitas the other night and \/swooooned.

And I'd love any recs for low carb options, frozen before or after.\n\nOne more question for those of you who may have tried this - I was also thinking of chopping and seasoning some veggies that are good roasted, then vacuum sealing for her to toss on a sheet and roast - good idea?

I've been craving buffalo chicken lately, but didn\u2019t wanna eat it by itself so decided to prep a quick buffalo chicken alfredo.\n\nIngredients:\n- 3 packs ready pasta (Barilla sells a few different varieties)\n- fresh spinach\n- a jar of alfredo sauce (Ragu is my favorite)\n- frozen chicken tenders\n- a bottle of buffalo sauce\n- seasoning salt and Italian seasoning\n\nDirections:\nCook your chicken tenders, then chop them up and toss them with buffalo sauce. Top your ready pasta with fresh spinach, alfredo sauce, and whatever seasonings you like, then reheat in the microwave for around 2 minutes or until the spinach is wilted and everything is reheated. Top with the buffalo chicken and a little extra drizzle of the buffalo sauce.\n\nI should warn y\u2019all that this ready pasta doesn\u2019t taste very good without sauce - it's the same as ready rice, which I also think tastes gross without sauce. Lmao. But if you don\u2019t feel like cooking and draining pasta, this works just fine - the alfredo really helps.\n\nAnyway... feel free to lemme know if you have any questions about the recipe! Also, because I know someone will probably ask, these are the Ello glass meal prep containers. I test and review a lot of containers and these are my favorite ones I've purchased this past year.

Water tested them and they are amazing. Comes with a silicone net around the container which is great for protection. I am closing the thread and leaving this solution for anyone who is in my situation. In Walmart, I have also seen Rubbermaid Brilliance and Pyrex containers, which are mentioned in the second Edit. They seemed also fine, however, they did not seem fine as Ello Duraglass (NOTE THAT I DID NOT BUY\/TRY THEM SO I CAN'T TALK ABOUT THEIR QUALITY, I am only talking about what it seemed like). Moreover, Pyrex ones had two compartments but the lid does not have separator, kinda making the compartments obsolete if you are going to carry it around.\n\n**Edit 2:** So overall, the suggestions are Pyrex and Rubbermaid Brilliance (glass ones). However, both have comments online about them leaking. I am also considering mason jars. But I guess this is enough advice. I'll mark it as solved this evening if new comments would be more or less the same.\n\n**Edit 1:** I am living in US and I have a budget of $50.\n\nHello Meal Preppers!\n\nI have just started prepping meals and I am an absolute beginner. Please help me finding a container for the purposes below:\n\nI  need a container that I can put in my backpack. I will bring the food  to my lab, and in the lab we have a microwave and faucet, so I will heat  the food & clean the container\/utensils at my lab. That is why, I  do not need heat insulation etc. What I need is that the container  should be **microwaveable**.  I was using silicone-lid plastic container, but it retains smell so I  decided I should go for something of good quality and made of a  different material. I am okay with plastic if it is not going to retain  odor as well. Long story short, second quality is that the container **should not retain odor**.  Third, I am okay with only 1 compartment (so I can maybe buy 2  containers if I want to bring 2 different meals), but it should be **leakproof** and this is a must, because I will put it in my bag.  If there are more than one compartments, then it should also be **leakproof between sections**.  Last but not least, it should not be like those small ones featured on  Amazon. I am looking for something that can hold at least 2 meals, since  my entire day is going to be at the lab pretty much.\n\nThese  are the qualities I look for. But I am open to other ideas\/techniques.  The only certain thing is that I'll put the food from the big container  in my refrigerator to this container I am going to buy, and I am going  to heat the food at my lab. The rest could be different if there is a  good idea.","upvote_ratio":0.77,"created_utc":1672654301.0},{"title":"Happy New Year!","author":"OhEmGeeRachael","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/gallery\/100utb7","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1672610557.0},{"title":"Meal Prep Calendar w\/ Macros?","author":"MangoOrdinary5047","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MealPrepSunday\/comments\/100obm3\/meal_prep_calendar_w_macros\/","text":"Hey, does anyone have a meal prep calendar (preferably monthly) that takes into account macros as well?

My dad is her primary caregiver as \u201cus kids\u201d are grown and our extended family all live hours away.

If not, at least long lasting in the fridge as he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019ll eat fresh ones in bulk quick enough between their schedule, etc.\n\n-Preferably not heated in the microwave as that makes him ill occasionally. Air fryer, oven, stove top, etc.\n\n-Minimal red meat as my mom cannot eat it during treatment. However my dad is a red meat fanatic, so ideas with that (or add meat later options) are still very welcome!\n\n-Single or double portion. Oftentimes my mom can\u2019t eat, and my dad doesn\u2019t want a ton of waste.\n\nHe\u2019s a foodie, so he\u2019s always thinking about his next meal.

It even had a feature to order groceries through the app.  \n\nI am doing to do my first actual meal prep, my primary question is how do I know what I can and can\u2019t freeze. I got a fairly hefty lot of produce.  I lost 120lbs from 2019 -2020 I have been maintaining my weight but my diet is atrocious.  Previously, I was almost completely off sugar. After getting pregnant it has entered back into my diet. So this week my husband and I are going back on our diet. All of that to say, most of the food I got is perishable fresh food. I don\u2019t want it to go bad.  When I normally grocery shop, I have fruits and vegetables that go bad before I even make the meal they belong with. \n\n\nSome of the meals I chose this week for reference egg roll in a bowl, chicken Caesar salad wraps , cheesy chicken taquitos, cheesesteak casserole with mushrooms peppers and onions, mini meatloaf meatballs with carrots and mashed potatoes, taco salad, chicken spinach and artichoke melts, turkey pot pie with a Parmesan crust, grilled cheese, avacado capreese salad \n\n\nSome things on the list that I don\u2019t think will be a problem to freeze are the soups (tomato basil and mushroom and chicken) and chili I put on my list.  \n\nThis is hopefully going to be a decent bit of food for a couple of weeks.  I don\u2019t want all the stuff to go bad.  I\u2019m a mom a nurse and have an extremely busy and tiring life. So ideally I\u2019d like to cook everything in advance and freeze it if at all possible, one to alleviate some of the day to day stress of preparing a meal.
