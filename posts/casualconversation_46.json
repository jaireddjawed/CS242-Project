My connection to her is not physical, it is in her presence, in the way she teaches. But I feel like I'm too old to hit on my teacher even if she was open to that sort of thing.\n\nI'm in my early 30s, I have a kid. So when I look at a woman who is pursuing a doctorate in her 20s I am both deeply insecure and unbelievably enamored. I think I've decided to just be a good student, but every now and then I think about asking her out. It's the FOMO that floats around in my brain.\n\nI don't know man, what should I do?",

My GSD has some social anxiety,  but she is used to this cafe since I bring her here often.  She is looking out for my sisters because we have separated. \n\nA lady walks by,  and I think my dog thought she was one of my sisters.  Either that she just had a very good vibe. My GSD was pretty eager to be pet by her. \n\nFast forward to maybe 10 minutes later,  my dog is lying down chilling. A man comes up from behind a couch that she's lying next to and tries to pet her without asking. She barks at him, which does not surprise me. The man asks if she doesn't like men. I say no,  she just doesn't like some people, which is the truth- I can't figure out a pattern to the people she doesn't trust.  In this case it was obvious- he surprised her.  \n\nNow retelling the story later, I realize that it may have been mean or inconsiderate to say, or could misinterpreted that way. Hopefully he doesn't base his self worth on his my dog thinks of him or something.",

Turns out I was decent at it, so I tried to chance it and try out some more cool stuff... well that isn't going to work out for me, so now I can potentially ride a desk for a couple years, do it all again through a different branch, or take my chances in the civilian world.\n\nLeaving the military isn't really scary so much as not knowing what to do next. I started listed things in this post but I got overwhelmed, because there's literally too much shit available. Use my benefits and go get a grad degree? Law/medical school? Options with private companies, working for congressmen, public sector, start over and join another branch? Go join non-profits? Be a teacher? Pursue my dreams of writing fantasy books that probably won't pay any bills?\n\n\"So what do you want to do? What are you passionate about?\"\n\nFrankly I don't know. On one hand, I know what I *set out* to do, but I found myself fairly open-minded so long as I saw that there was some upward mobility and the opportunity to do cool stuff. Turns out a lot of stuff can be cool if you just give it a chance. FOMO is a stupid feeling to have, but it's probably the best description of what's paralyzing me. \n\nThoughts?",

I walked on eggshells my whole childhood. \n\nMade me hyperaware of other people's feelings and way too good at appeasing them at a very young age. This in turn made me anxious and depressed and a target for manipulative assholes. (Talking about you, awful toxic first boss in the corporate world who just did awful damage to my self worth and mental health. )\n\nThe good thing is since she was not abusive or manipulative about it, ( just ill-equipped and lacking mental health support), I also have resilience and a support system, which made me able to recognize this in my early adulthood, get help and work on it. \n\nI can say I mostly overcame this in my late 20s and now it's like a super power. High EQ helps me be a good mom, partner, manager, team player, friend etc.\n\nWhen I think about it now, it shaped me in a mostly positive way. But I guess that's not true.

I’m determined to finish today but I’m considering taking tomorrow off for at least part of the day. \n\nI have chills and body aches and my Crohn’s is flaring up too but because I work from home, I don’t feel justified taking time off tomorrow.

All of their toilets have bidets, and many of their guests end up trying it and converting to the bidet life. \n\nOver Christmas, they gifted my mom and step dad a bidet, and they got pretty defensive and said they would never install it in their house, and that they wouldn’t accept the gift. This upset my aunt, and she took a shot at them by saying they have dirty assholes and if they think tp can clean it properly they are stupid. Also took a shot at the saying they’re insecure lol.\n\nI don’t think she should have been so mean, but I also think my mom could have just accepted the gift. They’re still fighting over it. \n\nSince I tried it years ago I have also been on the bidet train, so I’d like to hear from y’all why you don’t want one.",

        "text": "Ever since I was a kid I have so rarely felt like I belonged anywhere. I remember in fourth grade I was standing in line with the other kids waiting to go to lunch, and there were groups of kids talking all around me, but I was alone. That moment is my first memory of this notion that there’s something intangibly wrong with me. I’m 20 now, and I haven’t been able to shake that idea to this day. \n\nIn high school I dated a girl for 2 years, and I never even felt fully comfortable or myself around her. I had a group of friends in high school, I was a captain of the track team for 2 years, I belonged to several communities, but could never shake the feeling of being temporary, totally replaceable and alien. Most of all, I’ve never really felt known. I lie about myself a lot, so part of that is definitely on me.\n\nMy first year of college I had all the appearances of being happy and well adjusted. I was on the track team, my grades were where I wanted them to be, I had “close” friends. I was doing the classic college experience shit, but I felt the same as I always did. Just pushing along because I hoped it would get better at some point.\n\nI quit the team before the start of this year, and live a very monotonous, solitary life now. I was close friends with my current roommates last year, but we’re not close anymore. To be honest I never really liked them much, and they were just the first people I met. They’re not bad people, I just don’t have strong feelings on them either way. So now I have no friends, and occupy my time with working, studying, reading, and working out. Funnily enough, I’m about as at peace now as last year, despite my circumstances getting worse. I guess I want friends, but it feel silly when I’m not going to enjoy spending time with them.\n\nWorst of all I see this trait in my dad, who is well into his 60s now. He masks it very well, he’s a great conversationalist and built a long, successful career partially off his networking abilities/people skills. But I see a lot of bitterness towards himself and others in small things, his body language, a few choice statements over the years, etc. I feel destined to repeat his life, never feeling the warmth of belonging to a community.\n\nIdk why I wrote this honestly. Feels nice to share I guess, I should probably get a therapist lol.",

If most of my coworkers are 40+ and such I doubt that they'll all have the energy to sustain say an hour and half of Rihanna,Gorrilaz, Ariana Grande, Linkin Park and Korn songs but if the energy is such that 2/3 of the time will be vintage crooner and country songs which I personally don't know how the 'read the vibes' for I can see myself restlessly finding the evening tedious.\n\nHowever when I go through karaoke videos on YouTube in contrast to lyrics videos, I will say that something I'm starting to notice is the importance of the pause time for the instrumentals of the song (the interlude ?) before presumably having enough energy to resume the song again.\n\nBelow is a list of what I have in mind to go through which I'm expecting feedback on expectations for given my naivety on karaoke\n\n\\_\\_\n\nGust of wind by Pharrell and Daft Punk\n\nRide on time by Black box\n\nRhythm of the night by Corona\n\nBlame it on the rain by Milli Vanilli\n\nRun with us by Lisa Lougheed\n\nJust like heaven The Cure\n\nWe didn't start the fire Billy Joel\n\nPing pong song Enrique Iglesia\n\nMajor Tom -- Peter Schilling\n\nLalala, How do you sleep ? -- Sam Smith \n\nWhat is love? by Haddaway\n\nMy kind of lover—Billy Squier\n\nLive for today -- Grassroots\n\nToday -- Jefferson airplane\n\nCall me --Blondie\n\nEverybody wants to rule the world —Tears for fears\n\nCruel summer— Bananarama \n\nJukebox hero -- Foreigner\n\nYellow, Violet hill by Coldplay (and more Coldplay ?)\n\nWhen you were young by The Killers\n\nA view to a kill,Ordinary world, Come undone by Duran Duran\n\nHow far we've gone -- Matchbox 20\n\nFrench navy by Camera obscura\n\nTonight by Nina Gordon\n\nTom Diner by Suzanne Vega\n\nDark necessities, Cant stop, Californication, Dani California, Snow—RHCP\n\nGloria or Self-Control—Laura Brannigan\n\nTurn off the lights, I'm like a bird, all good things come to an end -- Nelly Furtado\n\nGimme a little sign -- Brenton Wood\n\nPocketful of sunshine Natasha Bedingfield\n\nOut of touch -- Hall and Oates\n\nYour move -- Diana Ross\n\n*If options for Spanish language songs are available*\n\nSilencio/Silence by David Bisbal\n\nEstrellas que me dan vida/Stars which give me life by Beto Cuevas\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\n*\"\\^\\_\\^ When in doubt go with a Disney song ?*",

        "text": "Last November my constant companion and shadow died. At fifteen he was old, tired and ready to leave, I was the one who wasn’t. In the weeks which followed, I found I had a lot of habits designed around his foibles, I automatically step over the threshold to my office because that’s where he slept, wait after I turn out a light for him to collect himself and I’m more attuned to his dinnertime than he ever was.\n\nEmpty habits…meaningless without the reason for them underfoot. I knew I was depressed, but grief is one of those things which have to abate, it can’t be “fixed.” I resigned myself to feeling low right at the worst time of year when the days are short and the weather sucks. Power on through, right?\n\nThe holidays arrived. My husband and I don’t celebrate as a rule and don’t exchange gifts, but this year was different. When I was five I asked Santa for a puppy and more than half a century later, he finally delivered.  Ten weeks old, the size of a large sweet potato…\n\nThe cloud didn’t lift instantly because the grief was for a personality not the container and the new guy’s personality was unformed and undiscovered. But seven weeks on he’s come into his own and the dynamic of my world has changed.  \n\nThe house is now wall-to-wall plushies and teethers, there’s a furball on my heels again who, despite having an actual name, gets referred to as “Mr. FOMO” a lot. Up for any experience, fearlessly charging into any situation, crashing out into a limp puddle of exhaustion the way only a baby can, then waking up recharged and ready to go again. It’s been a long time since I’ve watched someone experience “firsts”…first snow, first taste of cheese, first interaction with a cat. Youthful energy hasn’t been a part of my world for a long time and until it returned, I hadn’t realised how much I missed it.  \n\nI have a new companion and shadow. I can’t wait to see what adventures we’ll have.",

        "text": "Hope this finds you,  Red... or someone that knows you.\n\nI wanted to maximize my my trip efficiency and only stop for bathroom, food at fuel-ups. I was making great time when my fuel light came on. \"That's fine,\" I thought, \"I still have 40 miles reserve after I hit empty and there's a Costco up ahead a few miles that will save me on premium fuel.\"\n\nI guesstimated my proximity to Costco wrong and my truck died. I had run out of gas... 11 miles from my exit for Costco and 2 miles from the nearest gas station. \"WELP! Guess I'll be walking!\" I tried psyching myself up. Check-list: Phone, keys, wall-- ZOOM! A semi-truck blew right past me reminding me I was walking on the highway. I moved to the outside edge of the shoulder and began my march back in the direction I had just come from... an even larger slap to my pride as my trip efficiency was now back-tracking.\n\nThe Sun was a welcome companion on a frosty Indiana morning, but each passing car and truck reminded me of was still winter as the vortex of stiff cold air slammed against my chest.  With my hands in my pockets I figured it wouldn't have been so bad if I had ear warmers. \n\nThen suddenly, hazard lights in sight and a double honk informing me someone was pulling over to aid. YES!! I was not looking forward to walking 4+ miles and someone stopped for me in the first mile. Could this get any better?\n\nI approached the car and the driver had a gray hoodie over their head, I popped open the door to the assorted collection of McDonald's, Dunkin Donuts, and Starbucks cups stored in the passenger floorboard. I navigated my step carefully and thanked the driver for stopping. As I looked at who I was talking to, I froze mid-sentence. She was gorgeous. No make up, frizzy, red hair tucked into her sweater, and an attitude that matched. Black leggings and one of her Uggz Boots hiked up and resting on her seat. At 6'2\", 250lbs, I can be intimidating to many... but. not. her. \n\n\"You headed back to the last exit?\" She asked, almost like she was stating my intentions for me. \n\n\"Yes ma'am. I ran out of gas up ahead. Google said the gas station 2 miles back is the closest.\"\n\n\"Google's wrong, that gas station isn't open. You'll need to go up my way.\" She spoke so matter-of-factly that I didn't question her. \n\n\"You're the boss.\" I smiled. \n\nShe turned her music back on and to my surprise she was listening to Whiskey Myers who I had just seen in concert. 5 miles later, we were at the gas station and I thanked her profusely. She insisted she'd wait and give me a ride back. \n\nI walked into the gas station and asked to borrow a can. I headed to the pump and reached for my wallet -- phone, keys, wallet?! Oh no! I forgot my wallet!! I slammed the gas can down and let out a silent roar of frustration. I turned around in defeat and approached the Samaritan's car to apologize.\n\n\"Forget your wallet? How much you need?\" Again she asked as if making a statement. \n\nHumbled, I shrugged my shoulders and said, \"I don't know. 2 gallons, maybe $5-$6?\"\n\nShe threw her Starbucks cup out of the cup holder and onto the passenger floor board, revealing a mixture of bills at the bottom of the cup holder. She handed me $6 and just like that we were on our way. \n\nShe skipped around a few songs along the way and we both tapped to the beat of another Whiskey Myers song. Who was this fearless, commanding little redhead??\n\nThe music disappeared, \"That your truck coming up? Cool if I drop you on this side of the road?\" She asked, again more telling me than actually asking me anything as she pulled onto the shoulder. \n\nI thanked her again, sung her praise, and told her I'd grab money for her when I got to my truck. She refused and simply said, \"You're good.\"\n\nShe accelerated and I just watched her tail lights glow around the bedazzled Indiana license plate holder. I laughed to myself, \"What had just happened? Who was that? Wait, who was that??\" I didn't catch her name!\n\nI crossed the highway, shaking my head at myself for being inconsiderate and not exchanging formalities of names. I fueled up the truck and looked down the road, her tail lights were gone. I jumped in the truck, my wallet sitting in the cup holder. I drove up to the gas station, returned the fuel can, thanked the attendant, and proceeded to Costco with just enough gas to get me there and fill up. \n\nTo the Beautiful Stranger I dubbed \"Red\": It may have been nothing to you, you may not remember me, but you proved to me people still do good things without expecting anything in return and I'm thankful to you. You saved me walking to a closed gas station and saved me again from not being able to pay for my fuel. And you made 10 miles feel like 10ft with your music selection. Please let me repay you. If I had thought it thru, I could've just Zelle/Venmo'd you. If this message finds you, let me at least send you enough for your next Starbucks beverage. 😋\n\n2008-2010 White Chrysler 300 with Indiana plate driven by one bad Redhead, name unknown.",

Surely you would not keep your best friend outside all day long and then allow them to sleep outside! Also, they're supposed to be able to guard your property from trespassers. However, if they are kept outside in the backyard, they will not see/hear anybody approaching the property and therefore will not be able to guard your house.\n\nI genuinely am interested to know why people in America keep dogs if they do not want to interact with them. Please enlighten me.",

We live in the US and they honestly have had more hardship and heartbreak than I ever experienced before their age, even though I had a much “harder” earlier childhood. Their lives have just been harder in ways I never would’ve imagined for them. Life is hard now, for most\n\nBut anyways, I haven’t thought about her question before. She’s 26 and thinking about starting a family someday, and she’s not sure if she wants to. Not because she doesn’t want babies, but she’s worried about bringing them into the world and what could happen. Just a perspective I’ve never thought about.\n\nWhat do you all think of this?

        "text": "About a year ago, I took an interest in iPods after watching DankPods on YouTube, and decided to  go pawn shopping to see if I could find one.\n\nI eventually found a used but functional iPod 6Gen with a 160GB storage. Back in the day, that was the best iPod one could purchase. Upon its original release, it cost $349. I got it for $80.\n\nI booted it up today for the first time since January 2021, because I had finally obtained a 30-pin cable to charge it with from a thrift store, where the lady in charge gave it to me for free. I'm amazed at how much music I'm able to fit on this thing.\n\nI want to have something that I can use when I want to take a break from the internet, but still listen to music or watch movies on. So far I've been able to fit 12 albums and an audiobook on it, and next I'm adding a Librivox audiobook of The Bible. All of that combined won't have taken up even a quarter of the storage capacity on this thing.\n\nThe only gripe I have is that no matter how much I compress my video files, I can't put mp4s onto it, even though it supports it. It keeps bringing up a window saying that the iPod doesn't support or carry it. \n\nAnyways, Apple had a good thing going with the iPod Classic. They're compact, they can take a ton of storage, and there's still a high demand for them. It's insane how much these things go for on eBay alone. I saw a refurbished iPod being listed for $195, and there's an entire underground community dedicated to the refurbishing and repair of iPods.\n\nI'd certainly like to see Apple bring the iPod Classic back. No touchscreen, no internet, just a tiny 2.5-inch screen and a clickwheel.\n\nMaybe they could make a slightly bigger model with a bigger screen and storage, but it'd sell like hotcakes. It's nice to have something portable for entertainment, while also being able to disconnect from the internet.\n\nApple used to be so cool and innovative. When they weren't a large conglomerate that was rumored to buy Disney and thereby own basically the entire entertainment/tech industry, they made very humble but bold products that were just so amazing and original. \n\nBut that's enough of my rambling. What is a piece of tech or a product that you'd want to see return?",

        "text": "Hello, \n\nTo start off, were both born in a country in South East Asia, and met during our study in uni abroad (still in Asia). After graduation, we decided to stay and work, but our wages are just average, and definitely lower when compared to western foreigners working here.\n\nWe both wants to study a higher degree someday, but I would say that I have bigger ambition for it. She has worked for more than three years now, and make more money than I do. Last year, she started to plan on enrolling, so we looked into the choices, the costs and available scholarships. We knew then, that we do not have the financial capability, and also there isn't any fully funded scholarship available for the university that she wants.  She decided to try to enroll even though we aren't financially capable, since she wasn't all that confident that she would get admitted. After all the preparation (IELTS, an essay, and all the documents), she submitted her enrollment into the university. Three days later, which was yesterday, she received a notification email of her admission. I'm happy that she got the acknowledgement she deserves, but also feel so defeated since we won't be able to finance this. To cover the tuition fee alone, with my income, I'd have to save up for almost 10 years, and then I'd have to start all over. Never before in my life, I have the urge to google of how much can a kidney sell and if it is legal to do so. Google said it's illegal in the US, and I did not continue the read.\n\nShe's taking this all very well though, we'll probably look for other schools or other countries, and I'll have to look for a better paying job around next year. She said she'll print out the admission letter for the memory of it. \n\nHow come being an international student cost the same as a house in the capital city in my home country?! I could buy 3-5 cars with the cost! I'm neither rich or poor, but damn. I need a couple days to process this feeling.",
